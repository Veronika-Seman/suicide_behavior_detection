    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nWe all know the drill—health anxiety can easily take over, making even the smallest sensation feel like a huge red flag. But I’ve been thinking: there has to be that *one thing* you’ve found that really helps break the cycle of worry. Whether it’s a mindset shift, a specific activity, or something else entirely, what’s your go-to strategy when the anxiety starts to spiral?\n\nFor me, I’ve learned that shifting my focus to something completely unrelated—like a hobby or physical activity—helps interrupt the constant thought loop. But I’m curious: what works for you? Is it a simple routine, a mental technique, or maybe something surprising?\n\nLet’s get some conversation going and share our best tips! I’m sure we could all use a few new ideas.\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts!",

    "selftext": "I’ve noticed recently that Facebook and Instagram are flooding me with medical posts, (I won’t mention specifics). Every day I see stuff from the CDC, news articles talking about different illnesses, videos of people in the hospital, videos of people with medical issues.\n\nAt first it was simple stuff like “wash your hands.” And I clicked it, that’s how it got me. Now, I can’t open any of them without being flooded. \n\nThere’s a lot of talk about how social media is bad for mental health, but I never considered this facet of it. I relentlessly say “not interested” and the like, but it won’t stop. It’s like even that level of interaction is telling it that I want this. I don’t. I had my HA under control overall until this happened. And shy of deleting all of my socials, I can’t find a way to make it stop.\n\nI guess the point of this post is to say, no matter how small a post may seem, if it seems medical related be very careful not to interact with it if you have bad health anxiety, because the algorithm doesn’t care how bad it’ll send you spiraling.

    "selftext": "Hear me out. I have always had awful health anxiety where I get pulled into the internet spiral of doom. AI has helped me so much with this. I use ChatGPT 4o, so I’m not sure about the simpler models, but basically for any worry, I outline the concern, I explain I’m concerned, and then I ask for odds on what the cause is. \n\nI could be wrong, but I assume other worriers are also fairly analytical and are helped by seeing odds repeatedly for reassurance.  \n\nWith AI, you can get the answers you need to those ridiculous questions only we think about. For example, I recently learned that I’d used non food grade tubing on a reverse osmosis system.  It was only a couple of feet, but I began to freak out about chemicals. Using AI, I was able to do ridiculously tedious things like determine the possible chemicals, the risks, the actual water amount that might have sat in the tube (.3 ounces), and learned probably far too much about how tube classifications work. Now obviously, this is overkill for most people, but for health worriers, it’s awesome to have a calm and knowledgeable tool that can answer any ridiculous question, while not pointing to stupid Google sites - I.e healthline. \n\nI will never again use Google for searches if I can help it.",

Even some of their most scary health issues they talk about, they always include something hopeful somewhere, whether it be “the odds are in your favor that you’ll be fine” or “there’s a good chance you don’t have this”. Nemours’ articles, specifically the ones for kids, actually feel like they are trying to calm you down and connect you with some rationality, rather than making every tiny symptom into an urgent situation so they can sell you a product or keep your attention. I’ll never encourage googling symptoms, because that will usually always make situations worse, but if you are like me and you end up googling anyway, I recommend forums and Nemours articles because they typically aim to quell fears with an empathetic tone rather than escalate them.

    "title": "My advice after getting (mostly) cured from hypochondria through psychological aid (CBT) for five months. ",
    "selftext": "I had health anxiety as my daily norm, and the worst thing about it was that i started some kind of loop. I would worry about my heart, and then I'd get heart palpiations, and sometimes (when at its worst) something that felt like irregular heartbeats. I would then worry about having heart problems and heart attacks. I was put on a medication (anti-histamine), to ease these heartbeats so that I would be abled to sleep, as I would have palpitations for multiple hours before somehow falling asleep. \n\nWhen I first came in to meet my psychologist I had a plan set up, filled with things that I did not believe in first; Imaginary Exposure, Physical exposure - and the difference between watching and observing. \n\nIf you are not abled to meet a psychologist, I would recommend reading into these and learning how to do different exercises surrounding them. I'm going to give a brief description of these words and my exercises, but I would also like to start by saying that I am in no way an expert, and will only be writing from my experiences. \n\n  \n1. Watching vs observing\n\nThis is something that everyone with health anxiety does, and it is also something that increases symtoms. I still struggle with this a bit, and it is the last thing holding me back. I started getting heart palpitations for the first time in almost two months last week by wathcing a video by Dr. Mike, where he started speaking about heart problems, at the same time as I was doing an exercise that had my pulse up. This made me go from a state of observing any potential symtoms I would have in my heart (like most people do), to watching for a symtom, which is the worst thing you can do. \n\nMy exericise here was to lie for a minute and focus only on breathing, then one minute on a symtom I've been struggling with, to then focus on something in my room. This should be done in silence, and the first two parts has to be done with your eyes closed. When breathing, you should try your hardest, not to hyperfocus on a symtom. \n\nI did two sets of four reps of this every day.\n\n2. \n\nImaginary exposing.\n\nThis is where the biggest difference happened. Your objective is to make a chart, and then write down the worst possible scenario, for me it was to get sarcoma, being unable to be cured, and slowly fading away from life, leaving my parents behind in tears, and missing the future I had in front of me. I would then spend 10-20 minutes making a story in my head of this happening. The most important step of this is not neutralizing your thoughts. You are not to think \"this is unlikely\". \n\n  \nThis was horrible to do in the beginning, and as someone who barely cries - this did the job. That also means that i was abled to cry on command, like an actor lol. The tears stopped after many days of doing this, and it became easier to do. This led to me being abled to handle this fear with way more control. My psychologist compared this to a scary movie. It might be very scary the first time. But if you watch it 30 times, it won't be scary.\n\n  \n3. Physical exposing\n\nThis exercise consisted of mostly doing things that simulate different symtoms. One was to wear a tight shirt (thyroid things), one was two run up staris for a couple of minutes (heart palpitations-ish) or to breathe through a straw (difficulty breathing). You can create challenges depending on who you are. I did these different things over and over again until I no longer felt any anxiety connected to this one thing. It worked really well.\n\n  \nThese things might not help you, but it really helped me - and if you haven't visited a psychologist because you are too afraid to, do it! It is a big regret that I did not do it earlier. ",

This is so redditors can gain something from your post without feeling bad that they are not where you are currently at on their own journey. The reason we do this is that Reddit is another form of social media where many can fall victim to the social comparison trap. We do not want people to feel inadequate by comparing themselves to someone else's health anxiety management journey. This is why we ask redditors to include advice in their progress updates if they want it to be a standalone thread. This way people can gain information for their health anxiety management roadmaps from your post. Feel free to resubmit your post with advice added on if you want it to be a standalone post.

This has been going on for years, and it’s taken an emotional and financial toll. They haven’t been working and spend most of their time in bed, researching symptoms online and watching videos—habits that I worry are only making things worse. Though they’ve been encouraged to try things like taking walks or meditating, they agree but never follow through.\n\nWhile I want to remain supportive and understanding, I’m struggling to find the balance between being there for them and setting healthy boundaries. How can I respectfully and firmly steer conversations away from health concerns, especially when they become repetitive? We’ve gently discussed the possibility that this might be a mental health issue, but they seem fixed on the idea that something else is wrong. They’re now planning to travel to get more tests, as local doctors won’t refer them for any additional ones.\n\nI’m not sure if or when I should be more firm in telling them that they likely aren’t physically ill and that the discomfort they feel may be self-induced.\n\nIf anyone has been in a similar situation or has suggestions on how to encourage them to seek appropriate help, I’d really appreciate your advice.

Like, triggers that might not be obvious to people not experiencing health anxiety. \n\nThanks!",

It’s frustrating because **the treatment for anxiety and OCD is NOT the same.** In fact, regular CBT can often make OCD symptoms worse.\n\nIf you're constantly having intrusive fears but know they’re irrational, and it’s causing you to ruminate a lot or avoid certain situations, it could honestly be OCD. Especially if you tried regular therapy already like I had.\n\nMy tips on what worked for me -\n\n* \\[Definitively the best choice\\] -> Go see a therapist or psychiatrist who specializes in OCD; they can tell you whether or not you’re in the right place. \n* You can take a YBOCS quiz (one of the clinical scales for measuring severity of OCD) and see if the questions resonate with you. [Here’s a link ](https://www.thecalculator.co/health/Yale-Brown-Obsessive-Compulsive-Scale-(Y-BOCS)-Calculator-921.html)to one I’ve used in the past \n* You can talk to an [AI chatbot like this one](https://TheMangoHealth.com) to ask more questions about OCD and see if you’re symptoms line up.\n\nSince October is OCD Awareness Month, I wanted to share this for anyone who might feel stuck or confused about their mental health. **You’re not alone.**\n\nPS - If you already know you have OCD and have a similar story of getting the right diagnosis after being misdiagnosed, feel free to share.

I know how it feels to have it take over your life. I have dealt with terrifying symptoms that have lead me convinced that I was dying. I have been there. I know how scary and isolating it feels. I used to feel helpless, like nobody believed me that what I felt was so real. I used to seek reassurance from this forum and others countless of times. I have spent hours scrolling through Reddit, tik tok and google looking for help and answers. So trust me I know what you’re going through.\n\nAnd you know what I got out of reassurance seeking online? Nothing. Sure maybe I felt better for a short while sometimes, but then I would go right back when a new concern came up. But you know what did help? Getting off Reddit. Deleting tik tok. And stopping googling. The only people that can give you reassurance to your medical concerns are your doctor. And if you don’t feel like you’re being taken seriously even at the doctors, go to a different one. Keep going until you feel you have been heard and taken care of. Because that’s what it took for me. I used to find it very difficult to trust doctors, but you have to remind yourself that they know what they are doing. Demand for testing, labs and scans. Advocate for yourself, don’t let your symptoms be brushed off as anxiety without further testing. Because at least for me the only way I was reassured that everything was ok was to see the physical proof of my labs and scans. \n\nSo please if you are reading this and struggling, stop seeking reassurance here and anywhere else online. You will not find the answers to your medical questions here. Im sure that a lot of people do get helpful support here which is different, but if your are here constantly seeking reassurance I suggest to break the pattern.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "title": "Health Anxiety - Things that have worked for me",
    "selftext": "\n\nI struggled with HA for over 20 years. However, the last two years I find that I have been doing really well. I have tried many things over the years from Therapy, Meditations, breaking down my thinking patterns, taking my thoughts to court, and cognitive behavior therapy.\n\nThings that I have found worked well:\n\n1) Do not google symptoms, websites are designed to keep you on them... how do you keep engagement? By feeding people's fears. When I had the urge to google, I did a meditation or hard exercise.\n\n2) If my body has a weird symptom, I would give it week to 10 days before I would book a doctors appointment. I became aware that our bodies have sensations and have accepted that these sensations are normal. Try this experiment - Think about your big toe on your right foot. Really focus on it.... do you notice tightness? maybe some slight pain or a funny feeling? Our brains have enormous power, and hyper-fixation does cause physical symptoms. \n\n3) Meditate daily - Even if its only 15 minutes. Use a Montra. I use \"I am healthy, negative thoughts are not facts\" I say it over and over while beathing in and out deeply.\n\n4) Take your thoughts to court. How many times have you been wrong about your illnesses? Over the years I have convinced myself that I have had over 20 terminal illnesses and many autoimmune conditions. After many medical tests and physicals, I have always been wrong. Its unlikely that you will diagnose yourself correctly by reading and not performing proper diagnostics with no formal training.\n\n- I realized that I was having confirmation bias, I would latch on to the symptoms and make them fit a condition while ignoring the facts that proved me wrong. What's the chance that 4 different doctors would miss something, and all blood labs would be incorrect? Possible but highly unlikely. \n\n5) I now schedule a yearly physical and trust the results. This gives me my baseline health and my doctor can monitor for any changes. Now that I started to believe that I am in good health and try to take care of my body, magically the weird sensations have subsided.  Anxiety can cause physical symptoms and it's amazing what you can convince yourself is true.\n\n  \n6) I realized that the worry was destroying the thing I was trying to preserve (life). You want to \"catch\" the illness to prevent sickness or death, so you are constantly googling, seeking reassurance, go to endless appointments and have endless tests only to start at the beginning. Living in your head is not living life, I was making my life miserable trying to preserve it when all the real evidence was showing me that I was not in health danger. I started to try and really live in the moment, discard of the automatic negative thoughts and take deep breaths. The more I practiced, the pathways and my brain changed, and the anxiety came less often. \n\nI still have the occasional flare/spiral, but they don't last as long, and they don't trigger the same level of anxiety and depression that I have had before. \n\nFeel free to message me if you want to talk more and hoping you can start moving towards recovery.  \n",

If you would like your standalone post to be approved, please resubmit the \"update post\" with advice in the text body (such as detailing how you got there, or what motivated you to get to where you are now, etc). This is so redditors can gain something from your post without feeling bad that they are not where you are currently at on their own journey. The reason we do this is that Reddit is another form of social media where many can fall victim to the social comparison trap. We do not want people to feel inadequate by comparing themselves to someone else's health anxiety management journey. This is why we ask redditors to include advice in their progress updates if they want it to be a standalone thread. This way people can gain information for their health anxiety management roadmaps from your post. Feel free to resubmit your post with advice added on if you want it to be a standalone post.

Guess what, this is a rabbit hole: it only made my HA worse as now I have another ritual to perform lol.\n\nMy advice for today is: don’t ever do self test. Here are the few reasons:\n\n1) We often don’t have any professional knowledge to understand the context and the intended usage of a test, so the prerequisite of the test may not be satisfied. \n\n2) We don’t know the proper procedure to perform a test.\n\n3) We don’t know the threshold of positive or negative and how it should be associated with other factors like age etc. \n\n4) And we don’t know how to interpret tests: Each test has its sensitivity and specificity, and a set of tests often need to be combined to show any significance. \n\nSo if you are really obsessed with a particular self-found test, talk to your doctor who really can educate you, and forget about this test and move on. Next time, if you see anyone advocating some tests and claims that you can do at home, ignore that and continue your life.\n\n\n",

Of those thoughts: 95 percent repeat each day and on average, **80 percent of repeated thoughts are negative.**\n\nThis means that on average, only 20% of our thoughts are positive per day and they are competing for our attention with the other 80%. This 80% has megaphones but you know what, **we are not helpless**.\n\n* We can help the 20% of our positive thoughts shine brighter and dominate these negative thoughts. This is where \"marinating in the positive\" and contributing to the daily positivity thread in any way you can comes into play. **Attitude is a choice.**\n\nLet's fill this thread with some positivity from our daily lives and remind ourselves that positive things are happening while we battle the negative thoughts of health anxiety. **Some examples of things you can post include:**\n\n* Examples of positive self talk that you use for yourself (which will give others ideas that they can use for themselves regarding positive self talk).\n* Ordinary things you are grateful for (ex: your car started today or there is water to drink).\n* Small goals & victories you have accomplished.\n* Something you witnessed that made you smile, or something you did to make someone else smile.\n* Blessings, gratitude, and other positive observations in your life.\n* Accomplishments of self-care.\n* Something you created today (crafts, art, a meal...).\n* Find accountability buddies and report your self progress for some type of challenge.\n* Declaration of choosing a predominantly positive attitude in regards to HA or other aspects of life.\n* Examples of mental imagery you use for yourself to prepare for situations and/or recover from errors.\n* Declaration of acknowledgement and/or acceptance of certain things in your life (ex: emotions, health anxiety, etc).\n* Declaration of using a negative experience as a stepping stone in life to improve and get closer to your goals rather than let it interfere with your progress.\n* Declaration of living life in the \"here and now\", without regard to either the past or anticipated future events.\n* Declaration of ditching perfectionism and choosing to strive for excellence instead for something in your life (ex: \"being perfect\" vs \"being good enough\").\n\n**REGARDING \"journey updates\" standalone post**: Some of you may have been redirected here if you are providing an update on your progress via a standalone post. If you would like your standalone post to be approved, please resubmit the \"update post\" with advice in the text body (such as detailing how you got there, or what motivated you to get to where you are now, etc). This is so redditors can gain something from your post without feeling bad that they are not where you are currently at on their own journey. The reason we do this is that Reddit is another form of social media where many can fall victim to the social comparison trap. We do not want people to feel inadequate by comparing themselves to someone else's health anxiety management journey. This is why we ask redditors to include advice in their progress updates if they want it to be a standalone thread. This way people can gain information for their health anxiety management roadmaps from your post. Feel free to resubmit your post with advice added on if you want it to be a standalone post. Thank you for your cooperation.\n\nRegarding memes: Please post them here as a link and please provide a description so people know what they are clicking on. Like everything on social media something that is seen funny by one person can be triggering for another person.

Whenever my fear starts to take control of my body, I screenshot it.\n\n  \" once you accept death, you stop fearing \" \n\nSo, what actually causes it? What makes you keep searching for answers about your body? It’s your fear, and it’s your thoughts trying to take control of your body.\n\nNow lets move on to how your body precieves more negative emotions than positive ones \n\n  Our brains tend to perceive negative emotions more intensely than positive ones, a phenomenon called negativity bias. Negative stimuli capture more attention and are processed more deeply than positive ones. Research shows negative events have a greater impact on our psychological state and memory, leading to stronger emotional responses. \n \n\nThe question is how you can take control of your brain and body. First, you have to realize that every instinct and every action is directly related to your body. Your body and mind work together seemingly. What you feed your brain is a direct link to your body, and it’s true. This is how people with health anxiety would describe it.\n\nI have every health anxiety imaginable. Sometimes, I describe it as a combination of social anxiety, performance anxiety, health anxiety, waking up anxious and nervous, feeling like impending doom, panic attacks, a bloated stomach, and feeling like I’m in constant pain. I can’t eat properly, I’m underweight, and all of this is happening despite the fact that I haven’t died yet. Why is that? Because you’re only fearing your death, which is the root cause. You haven’t accepted the fact that you will die eventually, and all of this will eventually matter less. So why fear it? Why live in fear that is absolutely temporary and in a world that is not permanent? So get up, soldier, and start living. Don’t fear it; enjoy it. Thank you for reading.",

Of those thoughts: 95 percent repeat each day and on average, **80 percent of repeated thoughts are negative.**\n\nThis means that on average, only 20% of our thoughts are positive per day and they are competing for our attention with the other 80%. This 80% has megaphones but you know what, **we are not helpless**.\n\n* We can help the 20% of our positive thoughts shine brighter and dominate these negative thoughts. This is where \"marinating in the positive\" and contributing to the daily positivity thread in any way you can comes into play. **Attitude is a choice.**\n\nLet's fill this thread with some positivity from our daily lives and remind ourselves that positive things are happening while we battle the negative thoughts of health anxiety. **Some examples of things you can post include:**\n\n* Examples of positive self talk that you use for yourself (which will give others ideas that they can use for themselves regarding positive self talk).\n* Ordinary things you are grateful for (ex: your car started today or there is water to drink).\n* Small goals & victories you have accomplished.\n* Something you witnessed that made you smile, or something you did to make someone else smile.\n* Blessings, gratitude, and other positive observations in your life.\n* Accomplishments of self-care.\n* Something you created today (crafts, art, a meal...).\n* Find accountability buddies and report your self progress for some type of challenge.\n* Declaration of choosing a predominantly positive attitude in regards to HA or other aspects of life.\n* Examples of mental imagery you use for yourself to prepare for situations and/or recover from errors.\n* Declaration of acknowledgement and/or acceptance of certain things in your life (ex: emotions, health anxiety, etc).\n* Declaration of using a negative experience as a stepping stone in life to improve and get closer to your goals rather than let it interfere with your progress.\n* Declaration of living life in the \"here and now\", without regard to either the past or anticipated future events.\n* Declaration of ditching perfectionism and choosing to strive for excellence instead for something in your life (ex: \"being perfect\" vs \"being good enough\").\n\n**REGARDING \"journey updates\" standalone post**: Some of you may have been redirected here if you are providing an update on your progress via a standalone post. If you would like your standalone post to be approved, please resubmit the \"update post\" with advice in the text body (such as detailing how you got there, or what motivated you to get to where you are now, etc). This is so redditors can gain something from your post without feeling bad that they are not where you are currently at on their own journey. The reason we do this is that Reddit is another form of social media where many can fall victim to the social comparison trap. We do not want people to feel inadequate by comparing themselves to someone else's health anxiety management journey. This is why we ask redditors to include advice in their progress updates if they want it to be a standalone thread. This way people can gain information for their health anxiety management roadmaps from your post. Feel free to resubmit your post with advice added on if you want it to be a standalone post. Thank you for your cooperation.\n\nRegarding memes: Please post them here as a link and please provide a description so people know what they are clicking on. Like everything on social media something that is seen funny by one person can be triggering for another person. Please keep your subreddit members safe by providing a brief description of the meme you are sharing.",

    "selftext": "Hi all, so, I wrote these reminders for myself in my notes app during the beginning of the year when I had a bad health scare at the ER. Now, going back to it when I have an ongoing health scare reminds me about how many times I have gone through this, and how many times I have also overcame it. Hopefully, anyone who sees this can find comfort and solace in these words if you are in a difficult situation. I am with you! ❤️\n\n1. You are in control of how you are feeling. All these sensations that you are feeling now are all sensations you have felt before with anxiety, and it is nothing more than that. If in any case it is, there are always people/resources that can help you, like going to the ER where they are equipped to handle situations like these. It is not the end of anything and you will be okay.\n2. Your mind can manifest just as many physical symptoms as a normal sickness can. Anxiety can cause a plethora of symptoms that have nothing to do with actual sickness. There are lists of physical symptoms anxiety can cause and can fool you into believing that something is wrong.\n3. Think of the safest place you can be, mentally. Try to see if any of the symptoms gradually disappear over time once you start to relax your pacing mind. Think of all the safe places that your mind can go to (your bedroom, for example. A favorite person? A pet? Your family?) \n4. Know that anxiety is merely temporary feelings. Even though it feels like the end of the world, you have gone through these emotions and you WILL get through it just as you did every moment before.\n5. Try to think of similar situations you might’ve been in where your health anxiety spiked before. Notice the sensations in your body, have they happened before? And did I turn out okay in the end? For me, it helps to think about all the times where I was convinced that something was wrong.. when it was just my mind playing tricks on me (don’t let your mind win).\n6. Though you may be tired like I am now, when you feel like it never will end, understand that things will get better. It is hard to get rid of certain thoughts and feelings that never spiral, and I am sure that it is exhausting. I know it’s tough to stop the Google rabbit hole, but remind yourself that you are strong, you have been through this before, and there is a light at the end of the tunnel! \n\nFrom one health anxiety sufferer to another, we will get through it together ❤️",

    "title": "PSA: If you're on this sub, there's a good chance your health anxiety is actually a form of OCD. ",
    "selftext": "I post this every now and then because I was in a very dark hole with my health anxiety. I had some very real health problems I was dealing with, but my anxiety made them feel like life sentences. I could barely function, and was desperate for help.\n\n\n\nI noticed that any normal \"anxiety\"-based therapies did not help my health anxiety. If anything, they worsened it. Stuff like meditation, talking about it, writing about it, etc. It made my anxiety far worse. I knew that OCD ran in my family and I had small compulsions in my life, but I didn't realize that there is something called Pure-O.  Turns out, that's what I have!\n\nBasically, this type of OCD means you have compulsions and rituals (much like washing your hands) but they're all mental. For us with health anxiety, that means you might have an intrusive thought about your health and will immediately need to \"cleanse\" your mind by googling or asking someone for reassurance. Do you notice that you feel some relief, temporarily, but then the thought comes back and usually stronger after some time? That's OCD. That's the exact feeling someone has when they feel the need to constantly wash their hands. They just *need* to clean their hands physically, the same way you *need* someone to tell you that you're going to be ok, or you *need* to just find that one article that will tell you exactly what you want to hear and alleviate your fears.\n\nLuckily, treating OCD is simple though difficult to achieve. You can look into Exposure and Response therapy and all the other OCD therapies, but really it comes down to this - don't act on your thoughts. Don't create secondary thoughts from them. Definitely don't google or ask for reassurance. Just let your thought come into your head, and immediately try to focus your attention elsewhere. Don't even try to force the thought out. Any type of \"interaction\" with the thought isn't going to help. Just let it stay there, and eventually, it'll leave.  This is the basis of ERP which is the gold standard for OCD treatment.  It's very difficult to do on your own, so I recommend finding a specialist if you can.  However, I did a ton of work on my own that was immensely helpful, so it's possible.\n\nIt feels difficult at first, but over time you'll have a ton of practice. I still have good days and bad days, but my bad days are few and far between whereas they were 90% of my waking life before.\n\n\n\nYou're going to be ok :)",

There’s a male doctor at the same practice at her but I feel like I’d be more comfortable with a female doctor.\n\nI feel like every time I get a doctor rec online, I look up reviews and people say horrible things. It makes sense because most people leave reviews when they’re upset so there could be hundreds of people who love that doctor but they don’t post a review.\n\nAnyone have suggestions?

Anyways, I was doing some thinking and was wondering if any of you felt similarly.\n\nDo you guys feel like this whole anxiety about something being wrong with us, us being sick, or having a horrible fate or disease comes from a place of guilt, self-hatred and low self-worth? As if we believe deep down on some subconscious level that we deserve pain, suffering, and a miserable condition that leads to a miserable end?\n\nI know for sure that, having grown up with religious trauma, there's always a feeling of guilt whenever something bad happens. It feels like a punishment from God, as if it's because of something I did to upset Him, and now I'm paying for it. I feel like, for me at least, that definitely has something to do with it. I feel deep down that I don't deserve good things, health, happiness, or stability. Something wrong just has to happen. I am more used to stress and unhappiness anyway, so that is more of my natural state.\n\nAnd don't get me started on feeling guilty for enjoying pleasure (STD paranoias all the damn time). It seems like God certainly doesn't want me to have a good time and will punish me hard for enjoying my body.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Does anyone relate to this, or is this just a me thing?",

    "selftext": "\n\nLet’s pretend for a minute that your health awareness is like a home security system. It’s designed to let you know when there’s a real health problem that needs your attention. But what happens when this system is too sensitively tuned and reacts to every little trigger?\n\nWith health anxiety, your body’s alarm system sets off the alarm for every day, common, and not dangerous occurrences and that can lead to *constant* worry.  Imagine a security system that goes off every time a leaf falls or a car drives by, it would drive you crazy after a while! In a similar way, when your health anxiety is heightened even regular things like a little ache, cough, or palpitation can set off that big alarm. This heightened state of awareness and alert can be mentally exhausting because you’re bracing yourself for a major health crisis that ISN’T there. \n\nFiguring out what triggers your health anxiety alarms is a very important step to overcoming them. Is it because you fell down a Google rabbit hole? Is it because you’re doomscrolling on Reddit? Or could it be a new symptom or feeling you felt? By pinpointing those triggers, we can start to figure out which alarms are caused by real health issues and which ones are those false alarms. \n\nOnce you figure out those triggers, you can start refining how that alarm system responds. Put down your Apple Watch and blood pressure cuff and stop constantly checking your vital signs (I struggle with this too), and set a specific time of day to check them, such as once in the morning and once in the evening. GET OFF OF GOOGLE!!! Knock down the amount of time you spend online looking up and researching symptoms, because you’ll end up convincing yourself that you have the thing you’re reading about, and by reducing this you’ll reduce the amount of stress you put on yourself. \n\nOnce you get your alarm system recalibrated, you can relax a little knowing that it’ll alert you when there’s really something to worry about! It’s about finding that sweet spot where you can enjoy life without the unnecessary worrying. \n\nRemember that managing your health anxiety is super important, but also remember to seek out medical help any time you’re genuinely concerned about your symptoms. \n\nNEVER FEEL EMBARRASSED OR HESITATE TO TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR!!!!!\n\nAs a paramedic I’ve ran my fair share of health anxiety related 911 calls, it’s literally what we’re here for, and you deserve the care, empathy, and compassion that healthcare workers can give to you.

Of those thoughts: 95 percent repeat each day and on average, **80 percent of repeated thoughts are negative.**\n\nThis means that on average, only 20% of our thoughts are positive per day and they are competing for our attention with the other 80%. This 80% has megaphones but you know what, **we are not helpless**.\n\n* We can help the 20% of our positive thoughts shine brighter and dominate these negative thoughts. This is where \"marinating in the positive\" and contributing to the daily positivity thread in any way you can comes into play. **Attitude is a choice.**\n\nLet's fill this thread with some positivity from our daily lives and remind ourselves that positive things are happening while we battle the negative thoughts of health anxiety. **Some examples of things you can post include:**\n\n* Examples of positive self talk that you use for yourself (which will give others ideas that they can use for themselves regarding positive self talk).\n* Ordinary things you are grateful for (ex: your car started today or there is water to drink).\n* Small goals & victories you have accomplished.\n* Something you witnessed that made you smile, or something you did to make someone else smile.\n* Blessings, gratitude, and other positive observations in your life.\n* Accomplishments of self-care.\n* Something you created today (crafts, art, a meal...).\n* Find accountability buddies and report your self progress for some type of challenge.\n* Declaration of choosing a predominantly positive attitude in regards to HA or other aspects of life.\n* Examples of mental imagery you use for yourself to prepare for situations and/or recover from errors.\n* Declaration of acknowledgement and/or acceptance of certain things in your life (ex: emotions, health anxiety, etc).\n* Declaration of using a negative experience as a stepping stone in life to improve and get closer to your goals rather than let it interfere with your progress.\n* Declaration of living life in the \"here and now\", without regard to either the past or anticipated future events.\n* Declaration of ditching perfectionism and choosing to strive for excellence instead for something in your life (ex: \"being perfect\" vs \"being good enough\").\n\n**REGARDING \"journey updates\" standalone post**: Some of you may have been redirected here if you are providing an update on your progress via a standalone post. If you would like your standalone post to be approved, please resubmit the \"update post\" with advice in the text body (such as detailing how you got there, or what motivated you to get to where you are now, etc). This is so redditors can gain something from your post without feeling bad that they are not where you are currently at on their own journey. The reason we do this is that Reddit is another form of social media where many can fall victim to the social comparison trap. We do not want people to feel inadequate by comparing themselves to someone else's health anxiety management journey. This is why we ask redditors to include advice in their progress updates if they want it to be a standalone thread. This way people can gain information for their health anxiety management roadmaps from your post. Feel free to resubmit your post with advice added on if you want it to be a standalone post. Thank you for your cooperation.\n\nRegarding memes: Please post them here as a link and please provide a description so people know what they are clicking on. Like everything on social media something that is seen funny by one person can be triggering for another person. Please keep your subreddit members safe by providing a brief description of the meme you are sharing.",

    "selftext": "When something triggers your body and it starts freaking out just feel it, accept it and know that it's not dangerous. Look at it as an opportunity to heal, rather than something bad to be avoided. You then program your body to understand that there is no danger, for if there were actual danger then surely the mind would act as if there were danger also. When the mind acts as if all is well, even though the body is freaking out, then the body will eventually calm down and learn that all is well.\n\nDon't try and distract yoursel or hide from the triggers, that only signals to your body that there is actual danger. Don't react. Respond. All is well. You will recover. This is the process. It may take some time, but it works. Honestly, just live your life like normal and you will eventually recover, probably without even noticing until you're already well again.\n\nAlso I want to add that for me, yoga, meditation, and exercise (escpecially outdoors) helps me a lot. I also think that a keto or zerocarb diet can help a lot to calm down the body. I'm also going to try out some calming nootropics, although I don't think it's at all nessecary, maybe it'll speed up my recovery and help with sleep. Also some sort of reinforcment that your symptoms are actually only because of anxiety, and not something else is super helpful for me.",

Looking after my body - eating nutritious food, exercising regularly and getting enough sleep. Being physically depleted can make symptoms so much much worse. \n4.

I still have my rough moments, but I can tell I'm doing way better than a few weeks ago because I'm not running on fumes all the time. Also, in my specific case, the thing causing my anxiety was a muscle sprain, and those types of injuries heal better when you get enough sleep! So it's extra important lol. \nI know it's super tough to sleep well when you're focusing on how bad you feel, but you can practice and get better at it, trust me. Sometimes I have to take melatonin or put on soothing background noise to get to sleep, but once you do, that's the hardest part over. And noticing that I feel genuinely better after a few nights' sleep is pretty motivating!\nAnyway, this community has been helping me get through a lot lately, so I hope you all have a wonderful day/night and are taking good care of yourselves <3 And get some sleep haha",

    "selftext": "**The megathread for vents, rants, worries, fixations, DAEs, finding support/advice, finding reassurance, symptom focused content, or the like is located here :** [**http://reddit.com/r/healthanxiety/about/sticky**](http://reddit.com/r/healthanxiety/about/sticky) Thank you for using the above thread for the above content as some users may experience distress if they were to unexpectedly read content that they were not mentally prepared to engage with or are just trying to take a breather from. \n___\n\nThe average person has 50,000 thoughts per day according to the [Cleveland Clinic](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/turn-around-negative-thinking/). Of those thoughts: 95 percent repeat each day and on average, **80 percent of repeated thoughts are negative.**\n\nThis means that on average, only 20% of our thoughts are positive per day and they are competing for our attention with the other 80%. This 80% has megaphones but you know what, **we are not helpless**.\n\n* We can help the 20% of our positive thoughts shine brighter and dominate these negative thoughts. This is where \"marinating in the positive\" and contributing to the daily positivity thread in any way you can comes into play. **Attitude is a choice.**\n\nLet's fill this thread with some positivity from our daily lives and remind ourselves that positive things are happening while we battle the negative thoughts of health anxiety. **Some examples of things you can post include:**\n\n* Examples of positive self talk that you use for yourself (which will give others ideas that they can use for themselves regarding positive self talk).\n* Ordinary things you are grateful for (ex: your car started today or there is water to drink).\n* Small goals & victories you have accomplished.\n* Something you witnessed that made you smile, or something you did to make someone else smile.\n* Blessings, gratitude, and other positive observations in your life.\n* Accomplishments of self-care.\n* Something you created today (crafts, art, a meal...).\n* Find accountability buddies and report your self progress for some type of challenge.\n* Declaration of choosing a predominantly positive attitude in regards to HA or other aspects of life.\n* Examples of mental imagery you use for yourself to prepare for situations and/or recover from errors.\n* Declaration of acknowledgement and/or acceptance of certain things in your life (ex: emotions, health anxiety, etc).\n* Declaration of using a negative experience as a stepping stone in life to improve and get closer to your goals rather than let it interfere with your progress.\n* Declaration of living life in the \"here and now\", without regard to either the past or anticipated future events.\n* Declaration of ditching perfectionism and choosing to strive for excellence instead for something in your life (ex: \"being perfect\" vs \"being good enough\").\n\n**REGARDING \"journey updates\" standalone post**: Some of you may have been redirected here if you are providing an update on your progress via a standalone post. If you would like your standalone post to be approved, please resubmit the \"update post\" with advice in the text body (such as detailing how you got there, or what motivated you to get to where you are now, etc). This is so redditors can gain something from your post without feeling bad that they are not where you are currently at on their own journey. The reason we do this is that Reddit is another form of social media where many can fall victim to the social comparison trap. We do not want people to feel inadequate by comparing themselves to someone else's health anxiety management journey. This is why we ask redditors to include advice in their progress updates if they want it to be a standalone thread. This way people can gain information for their health anxiety management roadmaps from your post. Feel free to resubmit your post with advice added on if you want it to be a standalone post. Thank you for your cooperation.\n\nRegarding memes: Please post them here as a link and please provide a description so people know what they are clicking on. Like everything on social media something that is seen funny by one person can be triggering for another person. Please keep your subreddit members safe by providing a brief description of the meme you are sharing.",

Like “hmm this spot on my face seems kinda tingly or numb” and hours later I’m still thinking about it. Or “I think I feel lightheaded or dizzy?” And I think about it constantly and consistently to the point where I really become dizzy! \n\nI guess the purpose of my post is to see what others of you do to snap out of this hyper vigilance. How do you know if what you’re feeling is actually real or if it’s so thoroughly focused on that it BECOMES REAL? Do you have methods to share? I’d love to hear your answers so maybe I can stop creating more issues than I already have! ",

Of those thoughts: 95 percent repeat each day and on average, **80 percent of repeated thoughts are negative.**\n\nThis means that on average, only 20% of our thoughts are positive per day and they are competing for our attention with the other 80%. This 80% has megaphones but you know what, **we are not helpless**.\n\n* We can help the 20% of our positive thoughts shine brighter and dominate these negative thoughts. This is where \"marinating in the positive\" and contributing to the daily positivity thread in any way you can comes into play. **Attitude is a choice.**\n\nLet's fill this thread with some positivity from our daily lives and remind ourselves that positive things are happening while we battle the negative thoughts of health anxiety. **Some examples of things you can post include:**\n\n* Examples of positive self talk that you use for yourself (which will give others ideas that they can use for themselves regarding positive self talk).\n* Ordinary things you are grateful for (ex: your car started today or there is water to drink).\n* Small goals & victories you have accomplished.\n* Something you witnessed that made you smile, or something you did to make someone else smile.\n* Blessings, gratitude, and other positive observations in your life.\n* Accomplishments of self-care.\n* Something you created today (crafts, art, a meal...).\n* Find accountability buddies and report your self progress for some type of challenge.\n* Declaration of choosing a predominantly positive attitude in regards to HA or other aspects of life.\n* Examples of mental imagery you use for yourself to prepare for situations and/or recover from errors.\n* Declaration of acknowledgement and/or acceptance of certain things in your life (ex: emotions, health anxiety, etc).\n* Declaration of using a negative experience as a stepping stone in life to improve and get closer to your goals rather than let it interfere with your progress.\n* Declaration of living life in the \"here and now\", without regard to either the past or anticipated future events.\n* Declaration of ditching perfectionism and choosing to strive for excellence instead for something in your life (ex: \"being perfect\" vs \"being good enough\").\n\n**REGARDING \"journey updates\" standalone post**: Some of you may have been redirected here if you are providing an update on your progress via a standalone post. If you would like your standalone post to be approved, please resubmit the \"update post\" with advice in the text body (such as detailing how you got there, or what motivated you to get to where you are now, etc). This is so redditors can gain something from your post without feeling bad that they are not where you are currently at on their own journey. The reason we do this is that Reddit is another form of social media where many can fall victim to the social comparison trap. We do not want people to feel inadequate by comparing themselves to someone else's health anxiety management journey. This is why we ask redditors to include advice in their progress updates if they want it to be a standalone thread. This way people can gain information for their health anxiety management roadmaps from your post. Feel free to resubmit your post with advice added on if you want it to be a standalone post. Thank you for your cooperation.\n\nRegarding memes: Please post them here as a link and please provide a description so people know what they are clicking on. Like everything on social media something that is seen funny by one person can be triggering for another person. Please keep your subreddit members safe by providing a brief description of the meme you are sharing.",

So just not googling symptoms wasn't really an option for me.\n\nInstead, what eventually ended up working as of a few days ago is what I have coined \"hypochondria procrastination\". What I do, is if I notice some unexplained issue (mildly upset stomach, minor headache, etc.) I tell myself \"I will google it tomorrow.\" Or at some other specific time in the future. Naturally, being fucking stupid, I will forget to google it at that specific time in the future, and then end up not even thinking about it. If I DO remember, I just put it off again, but after a few hours the symptom I'm obsessing over usually goes away on its own (because it's from nothing dangerous, like most random aches and itches our body has).",

However, something deeper down is making them struggle with health anxiety.   \n\nFor me, I struggle to be myself so when I really think about it, my greatest fear is passing away suddenly without being myself to others. And if I can deal with that part first, I do accept that health is a cycle with ups and downs and sometimes terrible but unavoidable things happen.

If once is not enough, I do ii more than once.\n\nThere are other examples where I was successful - like headache, being overweight, knee pain. \n\nWhat also helps is just go for a casual walk and talk to myself, and find positive things and amplify them until it gets crystal clear in my mind that there is positive path forward.\n\nThe point I am trying to make is that each of us can exercise a lot more control over our bodies, which in turn gives us confidence to eliminate or at least mitigate whatever the symptoms and HA.\n\nTake my approach as a template only, and maybe try to figure out what may help you personally if you try something similar. Believing in your own strength is key - because it is true.",

    "selftext": "I’ve suffered from health anxiety for many years. I had a few rough episodes when my health anxiety first developed about 4 years ago, and this thread provided me with a lot of help when it was at its worst. Recently got back on reddit, and thought I would revisit and drop some things that have helped me manage over the years. \n1. Accept and release control. When I was in my worst episode, which lasted for months, I had seen multiple doctors regarding a specific condition I was fixated on. All of them told me that nothing was wrong, but it only provided me with temporary hits of reassurance. I was asking family members about it every single day. I soon became extremely emotional and felt like I was losing my mind. I came to a point where I exhausted all of my options and could not get any further reassurance. I remember this distinct moment where I said to myself that I simply don’t care anymore, and that if I have the condition then whatever. I released all control and accepted that if I do have the condition then fine, but I can’t suffer over it anymore. I stopped checking that specific part of my body and accepted that if I do have the condition then it’ll develop and I’ll eventually find out. Over time it got quieter and quieter until I forgot about it. I definitely did not have the condition and I was borderline psychotic in hindsight. I’ll never forget that moment as it was so liberating. I feel like so much health anxiety comes from this tight grip of control we hold over conditions we may or may not have. If it is possible to just accept and release that control it is so freeing. \n2. When I begin experiencing a new symptom, I take note of it and keep it to myself for 3 days before I ask anyone about it or make a doctors appointment. This has been so beneficial as I’ve found that my reassurance seeking was only feeding into my conditions. Nowadays when I get a new symptom I’ll usually either forget about it or it’ll go away within 3 days. If it persists after 3 days, i’ll allow myself to address it. \n3. No searching symptoms online under any circumstances. This one was the most difficult, as the uncertainty is what allows my mind to go wild, but the cost of the internet telling me I had severe conditions was even worse. There is so much misinformation online, and you’ll always get the worst case scenario.\nP.S this is simply what I’ve learned works for me based on my personal experience. Everyone is not the same and you may have a different experience. I just wanted to share in case it may be helpful to anyone who took the time to read. Wish you well on your journey, it does get better.  ",

Of those thoughts: 95 percent repeat each day and on average, **80 percent of repeated thoughts are negative.**\n\nThis means that on average, only 20% of our thoughts are positive per day and they are competing for our attention with the other 80%. This 80% has megaphones but you know what, **we are not helpless**.\n\n* We can help the 20% of our positive thoughts shine brighter and dominate these negative thoughts. This is where \"marinating in the positive\" and contributing to the daily positivity thread in any way you can comes into play. **Attitude is a choice.**\n\nLet's fill this thread with some positivity from our daily lives and remind ourselves that positive things are happening while we battle the negative thoughts of health anxiety. **Some examples of things you can post include:**\n\n* Examples of positive self talk that you use for yourself (which will give others ideas that they can use for themselves regarding positive self talk).\n* Ordinary things you are grateful for (ex: your car started today or there is water to drink).\n* Small goals & victories you have accomplished.\n* Something you witnessed that made you smile, or something you did to make someone else smile.\n* Blessings, gratitude, and other positive observations in your life.\n* Accomplishments of self-care.\n* Something you created today (crafts, art, a meal...).\n* Find accountability buddies and report your self progress for some type of challenge.\n* Declaration of choosing a predominantly positive attitude in regards to HA or other aspects of life.\n* Examples of mental imagery you use for yourself to prepare for situations and/or recover from errors.\n* Declaration of acknowledgement and/or acceptance of certain things in your life (ex: emotions, health anxiety, etc).\n* Declaration of using a negative experience as a stepping stone in life to improve and get closer to your goals rather than let it interfere with your progress.\n* Declaration of living life in the \"here and now\", without regard to either the past or anticipated future events.\n* Declaration of ditching perfectionism and choosing to strive for excellence instead for something in your life (ex: \"being perfect\" vs \"being good enough\").\n\n**REGARDING \"journey updates\" standalone post**: Some of you may have been redirected here if you are providing an update on your progress via a standalone post. If you would like your standalone post to be approved, please resubmit the \"update post\" with advice in the text body (such as detailing how you got there, or what motivated you to get to where you are now, etc). This is so redditors can gain something from your post without feeling bad that they are not where you are currently at on their own journey. The reason we do this is that Reddit is another form of social media where many can fall victim to the social comparison trap. We do not want people to feel inadequate by comparing themselves to someone else's health anxiety management journey. This is why we ask redditors to include advice in their progress updates if they want it to be a standalone thread. This way people can gain information for their health anxiety management roadmaps from your post. Feel free to resubmit your post with advice added on if you want it to be a standalone post. Thank you for your cooperation.\n\nRegarding memes: Please post them here as a link and please provide a description so people know what they are clicking on. Like everything on social media something that is seen funny by one person can be triggering for another person. Please keep your subreddit members safe by providing a brief description of the meme you are sharing.",

Writing on a calendar 2 weeks in the future \"have symptoms persisted?\" This has helped me in that if in 2 weeks things have not gotten worse/they've improved I will not follow up on it. \n2. If I hyper-fixate on a different symptom, sometimes the other thing I'd noticed disappears. In a way this helps to remind me that I am likely fixating. \n\nOf course if things DO persist, getting checked out by a doctor is the next step. Also, I don't guarantee these strategies will work for you, but just writing them in case they can help somebody. I'm still journaling on what helps me and tweaking the strategies as I go.",

I'm currently having a HA flare-up. \n\n\n\nI won't get into specifics as to why, but I'm stuck in a vicious cycle that goes like this:\n\n\"This symptom is bothering me. What if it's xxx? I should see a doctor.\"\n\n\"Oh my god, what if it actually is xxx? I shouldn't go to the doctor because they'll just confirm it. So if I don’t go, then it's not real.\"\n\n\"What if it IS real and then by the time I do go, it's too late to do anything, I'll die and I'll deserve it because I waited too long and I don't want to die! So I'll go to a doctor.\"\n\n\"BUT what if it truly is xxx? No I won't go, I'm sure these symptoms are nothing anyway.\"\n\nAnd thus the cycle repeats...\n\nI am so exhausted. I am paralyzed with fear. It feels like my mind is out to get me. Sometimes I try to think rationally, I try to think of what is the more likely explanation, but if there is even the tiniest sliver of chance that I could have xxx, my mind zeroes in on that and accepts that as the only possible reality. So by the time I'm ready to see a doctor I've already accepted my fate; there's just no way I don't have xxx, I'm doomed. Everything I have worked so hard to build in my life will have been for nothing. I'll lose everything. The other shoe will have finally dropped. \n\n\n\nThe worst part is when I do end up seeing a doctor, I don't even trust the test results. I don't know why. I'm not in the medical field. I don't have an education in medicine, so why on earth would I know better than someone who spent over a decade on learning how to do this job? And yet, this fact doesn't stop the anxiety or the cycle. It's still with me all the time. It follows me like my own shadow. \n\n\nEvery single time I have been so convinced that I have whatever illness, and every single time I have been wrong. Every time I wish I had just gone to the doctor sooner because then I could've ended my suffering earlier. But what would be the point? Because I know this cycle will just restart eventually with a new health concern. \n\n\n\nDoes it get better? Will it ever go away? Is there some kind of toolkit that I don't know about that will help me feel less powerless to my own mind? I don't know how to keep living like this.",

    "title": "Reducing or stopping Caffeine intake will REDUCE your health anxiety by more than you think",
    "selftext": "I speak to a lot of people with Health Anxiety and I notice a lot of people here, have an insanely high Caffeine and Sugar intake. Reducing this can actually stop a lot of health anxiety behaviours and symptoms, here is why; \n\n# What happens in our brain with Health Anxiety \n\nOur brains can be very stupid and illogical at times, they haven't evolved that much from thousands of years ago. When we saw a dangerous animal, our bodies would react with anxiety and fear causing the \"Fight or Flight\" mode to be activated.\n\nWhen the \"Fight or Flight\" mode is activated it changes your brain slightly. There is a part of your brain called the amygdala which becomes super active during this stage and heightens your emotional responses, In a dangerous situation such as seeing a tiger, overthinking can actually hinder your survival so the prefrontal cortex which proccesses logical stuff actually reduces in activity, at the same time cortisol and adrenaline is released in your body, these hormones help your body physically prepare to fight or run, however they also disrupt memory and logical thinking.\n\nWhen we hear or have a thought that we may have X Condition a lot of the time the Fight or Flight mode gets activated in our brain, its a very strong compulsion to act to effectively save ourselves,  however the amygdala's overactivation makes it difficult to assess whether symptoms are anxiety-related or indicative of a health issue. This uncertainty and inability to rationalize can increase the need for reassurance, perpetuating the cycle of anxiety.\n\nHealth conditions aren't usually a fight or flight type thing, they don't require immediate action, but because our minds is trying to save us, our logical part of our prefrontal cortex reduces so it makes it so much harder for us to understand that these conditions are super unlikely to be actually happening to us. \n\n# Why Caffeine is bad for Anxiety\n\nCaffeine functions as a stimulant in that it energizes your central nervous system. It may also cause tachycardia, hypertension, and feelings of excitability or nervousness.\n\nCaffeine also releases adrenalin which is also literally called the fight-and-flight hormone. It is triggered by caffeine in the adrenal gland. The adrenaline makes sure that the body reacts quickly to stress through increased heart rate, high blood pressure and more energy.  \nCaffeine prevents the production of the neurotransmitter adenosine which normally induces sleep. It obstructs adenosine resulting in further release of other transmitters like dopamine and norepinephrine which causes further increase in neuronal activation.\n\nEffectively when you take Caffeine especially in high dosages, your body will be constantly in a state of fight or flight and when you are in this state of self induced fight or flight your brain will be trying its hardest to seek what exactly the danger is, and health anxiety is the perfect area for the brain to settle if it cannot seek an immediate danger. \n\nSugar also can push your body to go into flight or fight mode, because it causes your pancreas to release insulin, if you consume too much sugar in a short period, your body will produce a lot of insulin, In response to a rapid drop in blood sugar, the body will release stress hormones, including adrenaline which again pushes you into that fight or flight mode.\n\n# Rewiring your brain\n\nIn CBT there is something called the three systems model, this states there is three main states we are in.\n\n1. **Drive System -** Acheiving Goals, Consuming Food, Accomplishing Tasks, Going to the Bathroom etc \n2. **Threat System -** Managing Threats, Survival, Escaping, Fear etc\n3. **Soothing System -** Slowing Down, Sleeping, Relaxing, Spending time with friends, Playing Video Games, Watching Movies etc etc \n\nNow the issue with Anxiety and especially Health Anxiety is that we spend way too long in number two which is the threat system which means we can get stuck in \"Flight or fight\" mode, you maybe here due to nothing causing it, you literally can be here from drinking too much caffeine but your brains illogical part shuts down and then you attribute the threat to be the medical condition you have. \n\nThe goal is to try and move your default state into the Soothe system and not into the threat system, and Caffeine is one of the main causes for being in the threat system when you don't need to be.\n\n&#x200B;",

I call it “phone a friend.” It is exactly what it sounds like.\n\nWhen you have an anxious thought…  call a friend! More specifically, ask them for two things: \n\n1) To say something reassuring (I have learned there is great power in a comforting word from a friend so I ask for it directly!) \n\n2) To let you know what you should do to investigate the symptom further. This usually looks like \n-nothing or continue monitoring \n-tell your doctor at next visit, no rush\n-get an appt with your doctor \n-go to the emergency room\n\nThis works well because our anxious brains want to take action and we do this by googling or overthinking/spiraling.

I was diagnosed with panic disorder secondary to illness anxiety disorder and was subsequently put on beta blockers.

Which I didn't think would be of any use due to being a sort of \"scientific/rationally-minded\" sort of person, but I do find it really calming when I realise there's nothing I can do until I can see a doctor. I think it's the feeling of your body working in a way that's aimed at mental wellbeing rather than working out to be physically healthy that sort of grounds me a little. \n\nWhether or not meds or excerise works for you (and neither work to really combat this constant limbo resolutely - but I hope you all find something that does), I'd like to say thank you for replying, and it's comforting to know I'm not alone.  \n\nRespect to you all, people underestimate how hard it is to function while dealing with this ✌️",

However, as illogical as it is, I'm almost totally unfased by the idea of getting specific types of it. For example I'm terrified of getting melanoma or lymphoma, and I've gone through very draining and stressful periods of trying to repeatedly reassure myself that I'm not in any danger, but if I see a person talking about their brain tumor or leukemia diagnoses, I can just confidently think \"yeah that's not going to happen to me\".\n\nAnd I just find it so weird. The craziest part is that I have zero worries about my cardiac health even though my dad passed away from sudden heart disease in middle age.

    "selftext": "* We may follow below tips to get rid of health anxiety : \n\n1.  **Educate Yourself**: Gain a better understanding of the human body and common health conditions. Learning more about the causes, symptoms, and statistics of various illnesses can help demystify them and reduce unfounded fears.\r  \n\r\n2. **Limit Dr. Google**: Avoid excessive searching for health information online, as it can often lead to misinformation and increased anxiety. Stick to reputable sources and consult with healthcare professionals when needed.\r  \n\r\n3. **Set Boundaries**: Establish specific times for health-related concerns and avoid constant monitoring of your body or symptoms. Allocate time in your day for health worries and then move on to other activities.\n4. **Mindfulness and Relaxation**: Practice relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, or yoga to manage anxiety. These methods can help you stay grounded in the present moment and reduce the tendency to catastrophize about the future.\r  \n\r\n5. **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**: Consider seeking therapy with a mental health professional who specializes in CBT. CBT can help you identify and challenge irrational health-related thoughts and develop coping strategies.\n6. **Avoid Reassurance-Seeking**: Resist the urge to constantly seek reassurance from healthcare providers or loved ones. Excessive reassurance-seeking can perpetuate anxiety and reinforce negative thought patterns.\n7. **Healthy Lifestyle**: Maintain a balanced diet, exercise regularly, get enough sleep, and reduce or eliminate the use of alcohol, caffeine, and other substances that can exacerbate anxiety.\n8. **Set Realistic Goals**: Gradually expose yourself to situations that trigger health anxiety, but do so in manageable steps. Celebrate your successes, no matter how small, to build confidence in managing your fears.\n9. **Support System**: Share your concerns with trusted friends and family members who can provide emotional support. Sometimes, discussing your anxieties can help alleviate their intensity.\n10. **Professional Help**: If health anxiety significantly impairs your daily life, consider consulting a mental health professional who can provide guidance, support, and, if necessary, medication to manage symptoms.\r  \n\n\n* Last of all remember that overcoming health anxiety may take time and effort, but with persistence and the right strategies, you can significantly reduce its impact on your life.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n",

For me, it was a 3 month online therapy course. It specifically focused on CBT therapy + a bit of exposure therapy. My two key takeaways/exercises that really helped me: \n\n1. Make worry time. Designate a time during the day where you can worry. If you have the urge to Google your symptoms, tell yourself, I’m just going to wait until later tonight where I can worry about this during my “worry time”. I usually tried not to spend more than 10-20 mins on this.\n\n2. Breath in for 3 seconds, hold your breath for 3 seconds, exhale for 3 seconds. Repeat a few times. \n\nYou got this. Stay strong.\n\nI know this community provided me the answers and reassurance I needed it when my HA was at its all time high. I hope I can give back and help others out.",

    "title": "There is a difference between 'health anxiety' and 'anxiety about your health'",
    "selftext": "Five years ago I made a post on here detailing my experience overcoming health anxiety, and I just recently became active again. I made this decision after stumbling across the immense amount of people suffering with health anxiety on a daily basis in the megathread. I decided I would start responding to these daily posts in the hopes that a small amount of my time could potentially make a big difference for someone who feels lost.\n\nThat brings me to the subject of this post: one thing I see time and time again in this thread is people mistaking *health anxiety* with *having anxiety about your health*. These are **completely different** things.\n\nHealth anxiety is a mental health disorder (thankfully, one of the most treatable), and the absolute *hallmark* of this disorder... shall we say, a **requirement** of this disorder, is that at the bare minimum you need to have been seen by a medical professional.\n\nI will repeat that again: in order to have 'health anxiety', you MUST have been to a medical professional. If you haven't, then you don't have health anxiety. At least, not yet.\n\nNow I know what you might be thinking: even if I haven't been to a medical professional, isn't it possible that my symptoms are caused by stress and anxiety? Of course, the answer is a resounding YES. But you have to understand that health anxiety has little to do with those symptoms, and rather your *reaction* to those symptoms.\n\nIt is completely normal for people to experience uncomfortable bodily sensations and to assume the worst. That's just part of being human for many of us. I was one time discussing this with a friend who is a nurse. She told me that every year, around the holidays, they have thousands of people come in complaining of chest pain (thinking they are having a heart attack), but in reality they are just stressed out about the holiday season.\n\nThe difference between people with '*health anxiety*' versus people who just have '*anxiety about their health*' can typically first be seen in how they *react* when a doctor tells them nothing is wrong with them and it is just stress. A person without health anxiety will be *relieved* to know nothing is wrong with them and generally that will mark the end of this experience. A person with health anxiety, on the other hand, will tend to *mistrust* the diagnosis, assume the doctor is simply incompetent or hasn't ordered enough tests, and this will often times start a multi-month or multi-year journey of seeking out a diagnosis that was already provided, but simply not *accepted.*\n\nIf you are going into the daily thread to post about medical symptoms that you have never been checked out for, you are *in the wrong place*. Not only is this subreddit not made for you, but the 'comforting replies' you may expect to get in that thread will only serve to HURT you by potentially delaying your motivations to see a doctor. The truth is, **even if you do have health anxiety, the best thing you can do is see a doctor to** ***confirm*** **that.** That is a cornerstone of the healing process, because it provides you with the ammunition to react more appropriately to your unrealistic thoughts.\n\nThe sad reality is that 'anxiety about your health' is not a disorder. That is just part of being human. It is when that anxiety becomes *irrational*, meaning you refuse to accept the results of tests or your reactions to bodily sensations are considered far outside the norm, and when that irrational anxiety begins to negatively affect your life and ability to function, that you have 'health anxiety.'",

This is so redditors can gain something from your post without feeling bad that they are not where you are currently at on their own journey. The reason we do this is that Reddit is another form of social media where many can fall victim to the social comparison trap. We do not want people to feel inadequate by comparing themselves to someone else's health anxiety management journey. This is why we ask redditors to include advice in their progress updates if they want it to be a standalone thread.

    "selftext": "Just found this subreddit and tought i had to share how my health anxiety is almost completely gone. And its been gone for a couple of years now.\n\nMy way of overcoming it isn't by any means a way i would recommend to anyone, since it was extremely time consuming and ate thousands of hours of my life. Hours wich i could've done something better with, even tough it almost cured my health anxiety.\n\nSo just like every hypochondriac i tought i had new diseases ALL the time. I can't even count how many diseases ive tought i had. And as most others i always googled the symptoms and some horrible disease came up. But my anxiety became worse and worse through the years and after a while basicly all i did for a period of 2 years was to read about diseases. \n\nI was completely obsessed. Reading in my freetime and at work every opportunitie i got. I started to read on all the \"normal\" websites in my first language (english is my second language) at first. Read everything i could get my hands on. Then i started reading these websites that had alot of words that only doctors and such would understand. So i started googling all these words and phrases so i could understand what was being said on these websites. And after a while once i didn't think my first language websites had all the information i wanted on whatever disease i had that week, i started to read everything in English too. \n\nI got so extremely knowledgeable on a ton of diseases that i started to understand every small detail and intricacies of alot of diseases. Then i started to understand that the first website that comes up when you google some symptom is just a short summary of an disease. And yes you might have the same symptoms, but if you get get very familiar with a disease, you start to see that the symptoms you have are not at all the same as most people with this specific disease are experiencing at for example an early stage of a disease. Im not sure if im explaining it really well, but i hope you get the gist of it.\n\nBut i think what eventually \"cured\" me from health anxiety was the same thing as exposure therapy, even tough i did it unknowingly. Becouse i did spend thousands upon thousands of hours reading (and looking at pictures) about diseases in 2 different languages. \n\nI do suffer from other forms of anxiety still. But i would say that my health anxiety is atleast 85-90% gone. I feared so much for so long, and i exposed myself so much that it no longer scares me. If i get some symptom now i basicly think its nothing, or im brave enough to accept whatever disease that might come and just move on with my day.\n\nBut like i said earlier i would not recommend my way of overcoming this to anyone. There are probably tons of better advice and less time consuming out there. But i wanted to share my story becouse it might help someone in some way.",

    "title": "Interesting interaction with AI and what I learned",
    "selftext": "Hey everyone, checking in again [five years after I made this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/898up0/comment/jvunyho/?context=3) detailing my experience with health anxiety. As I think I mentioned there, I don't really use Reddit, so I apologize for not responding to any of the amazingly supportive comments. I'm doing excellent, never relapsed, totally moved on, etc. - but that's not what this post is about.\n\n**Note: I will NOT be sharing a link to the app I'm about to talk about. I have firmly explained why people with health anxiety should ONLY discuss medical issues with a doctor - not Google, not AI, not even family members. I completely stand by this, and you need to recognize I am writing this as a person who does NOT have health anxiety anymore. Please do not ask for a link.**\n\nI'm a programmer by trade, and naturally I've been working heavily with AI. I recently made an application with AI that allows you to input your age, biological sex, location, medical history, and a list of symptoms you are experiencing, and it will spit out the top 5 most likely explanations based on the totality of the information present *and the relative likelihood* based on the epidemiology. In other words, based on your age/location/medical circumstances, what is *most likely*.\n\nMost people (including myself when I developed health anxiety) think of medicine as a matching game, where the disease that best matches their symptoms is the most likely explanation. That is *completely wrong* and not how the world works, which is something those of us with health anxiety have to learn the hard way. We desperately want an explanation that fits everything into a nice clean box, so when we Google our symptoms and find a rare disease that exactly matches our symptoms, we assume that must be the most likely scenario. News flash: in reality, *it's much more likely* that we are simply suffering from a combination of much more common, benign conditions.\n\n**That's where things get interesting.** I had the idea yesterday to take the exact symptoms and demographic data from when I first developed health anxiety, using my original post on here as a reference since I hardly remember the exact details, and I plugged it in to the app. Imagine the shock on my face when the results showed *overwhelmingly* that my initial symptoms were best explained by:\n\n**Anxiety/Panic Disorder - Extremely Likely**\n\nNone of the conditions I thought I had, which caused my health anxiety in the first place, even made the list at all (which implies they were well below a 1% chance).\n\nNot only that, but as I started adding more and more of the 'symptoms' that developed as my health anxiety progressed, such as my fainting incident in the shower, eye issues, etc, the diagnosis essentially stayed the same, and the AI correctly identified all of the completely benign conditions that explained exactly what happened.\n\n**Now here's the craziest part:** I went through hell for the better part of a year. Multiple ER visits, overnight hospital stay, and more tests than I can count, *NEVER ONCE* did a medical professional mention the word \"anxiety\" or \"panic\" to me.\n\nNEVER ONCE.\n\nI figured out I had anxiety completely on my own, and even after explaining to my neurologist that I thought I had figured it out after all this time, he completely dismissed me. Now, I am **NOT** implying that these medical professionals are not doing their jobs - in fact, they are doing their jobs perfectly. They are running tests and ruling everything out. But on the other hand, I could have saved myself a *lot* of suffering if I had even known anxiety/panic disorder could potentially explain my situation.\n\nEven to this day, Googling my initial set of symptoms brings up a host of potentially dangerous and extremely scary diseases that are bound to trigger anxiety, whereas an AI that has been told specifically to utilize the relevant demographic data and weigh relative probabilities was quickly able to identify that anxiety was a much more likely explanation. In my mind, that is pretty damn cool.\n\nOnce again, don't bother asking for a link as I won't be providing it. The moral of this story isn't that you should be using an app to double check if you have health anxiety, it is that you need to **get it through your head that your thoughts as a non-medical professional are completely worthless**. You truly know nothing. If you are experiencing what you perceive to be a health crisis, *get checked out first*, and then once you get checked out, remind yourself that your perceptions are not reality, and in this case AI just so happened to be the medium that proved that yet again.",

    "selftext": "Even on subreddits like r/askdocs, seldom does an actual doctor that specializes in your condition's illness post. Most often, it is grade schoolers, high schoolers, and god forbid pre-med students playing Dr. House. In some cases you'll get med students, but they aren't doctors either. \n\nI fell into a 3 month long depression because I posted on r/askdocs on my throwaway. For me, it was a red patch on my tongue with some white in and around it.  I posted a picture of it and everyone diagnosed it as you know what. I am not surprised, if you google this, you will see the only possible conditions are what you would expect... (C word).\n\nWhen I went to see the doctor, he laughed at the notion of it being that, and immediately diagnosed me with stomach issues (he saw the evidence of acid reflux in my mouth and referred me to a GI specialist). I made some life style changes (quit smoking, stopped drinking juice at night, made sure to eat no less than 3 hours before sleeping, etc.) Within a few months all evidence of that illness in my mouth went away.\r  \n\r  \nNot a single person in my thread mentioned ANYTHING about GI issues. Even Google provided NO hits for GI issues (which is probably why no one said anything, since all people do on Reddit is just Google your symptoms and read back the same shit you read and frightened yourself with). The only issue that came up that wasn't the C word was \"geographic tongue\", but my doctor says this is very often misdiagnosed especially in people with GI issues and/or on antibiotics. Once I started looking into GI issues and how it manifests on the tongue, I found MANY people talking about their strange tongues, and even finally found a person who posted a pic of their tongue that looked just like mine (on one of the GI issue subreddits, no less, and he was also diagnosed with GI issues). \n\nHours and weeks of research never ONCE revealed this benign condition that I had. If it had, I would have immediately known, because I had been waking up with stomach pain every day for the better part of a year, had even awoken in the middle of the night a few times with what I thought was vomit in my mouth (it was acid from acid reflux), and constantly was using the washroom 5x a day.

That being said, **this film is not pleasant and it is not hopeful, but it is** ***HONEST*****,** and those who have seen it and who don't have HA, have told me for the first time, \"I can start to understand what you're going through.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[WATCH HERE](https://vimeo.com/dansilverfilms/benignshortfilm?share=copy) *(TW: please only watch if you feel like you're in a good place mentally. The film follows a man who discovers a bump on the back of his head and spirals into madness)*\n\nAs someone who deals day to day with OCD, specifically with HA and emetephobia, I always struggled to properly explain what my struggle really felt like. This film is an exploration of what my anxiety and intrusive thoughts feel like. Invisible illnesses like anxiety, depression, and OCD, are so hard to properly explain to someone who’s never experienced it; so I wanted to explore it in a visual and tangible experience that I believe is what film, as an art form and storytelling tool, achieves best.  \nI have never seen a realistic depiction of what my mental health issues feel like, especially health anxiety, and so my goal with this film was to show the rawest and most realistic portrayal of it that I could. Being able to present these inner demons that myself and many others battle every day, and make them digestible so that anyone could experience how debilitating and uncomfortable it is to go through, can maybe—hopefully— challenge the way we talk about these things.  \nIn a way, this film is a release of all the thoughts and feelings I’ve had and have struggled with. It’s been therapeutic to let it out. To create a worst case scenario as a reminder to myself how ridiculous it looks when you take a step back from your own inner turmoil and reflect.

    "selftext": "1 - You need to chance it.\n* This is the big deal. This is the thing. I can't say for certain that there is nothing wrong with you physically. No one can. And I know what you feel. What if there is something? What if I convince myself I've got anxiety now only to end up with a morbid disease? Won't I feel much worse? The thing is there is no way of knowing that for certain, though of course, the chances are very low. The chances are, if you are here now, cleared of all those medical tests and such, the only thing that is pathological about you is anxiety. Anxiety is a pathalogical liar. However, you will never heal from anxiety if you don't ever chance it, and live your life in constant fear and dread and panic. You know this. No matter what, this is just no way to live. You have got to chance it. Despite physical 'symptoms,' despite everything, chance it now, and go along with it. Physical symptoms won't just go away, but you have to keep telling yourself that you have just got anxiety if you are ever to recover from this.\n\n2 - Start doing something you enjoy\n* I can't stress this enough. Anxiety is a way of our brains to say, \"Hey, you are important, too.\" You have got to give yourself some time every day to do something you enjoy doing. Watch movies, play computer games, whatever. You will just forget about this irrational feeling that is anxiety. And in time, you will see how silly it was of you to feel that way.\n\n3 - Start exercising\n* One of the things that made a lot of difference in my case was exercise. I enrolled in a gym, and went every day, except Sundays. I would feel the anxiety literally vanish as I ran on the treadmill. Exercise is how you banish anxiety. It just vanishes all of a sudden, even though for a short time.\n\n4 - Meds help\n* This is a sensitive subject, but if you are prescribed medicine, be sure to use them as your doctor described. It might take some weeks and even months for them to take effect. They can make it easier for you to deal with anxiety. Meds help, but they don't cure. They help a lot, though. They can make you see things more rationally.\n\n5 - Start therapy\n* Start paying a therapist instead of a physician. For myself, CBT helped me to such an extent that it became a part of my life. It helped me see hiw irrational and negative I have been. I now look back, and only feel silly for having such heightened levels of anxiety. Now, I am no longer frightened, and live my life confidently. I owe it to therapy.",

    "title": "Do you think ABA (Applied behavior analysis ) is more effective at treating Health Anxiety than talking to a therapist?",
    "selftext": "ABA is more focused on reinforcing desirables behaviors and help undesirable behaviors go extinct. Take the following example and see how ABA would be applied:\n\n'Client A is watching TV. The TV plays a medical commercial. Client A begins to panic. They proceed to google about symptoms until they find information that tells them they are not likely to have the disease in the commercial. After a day of googling and panic, Client A finds the information and calms down'.\n\nIn ABA we would break this down to three part contingency (ABC) - Antecedent, Behavior, and Consequence\n\n* Antecedent (aka the trigger) -  A medical commercial plays.\n* Behavior - Client panics and proceeds to google symptoms until they find information that calms them down.\n* Consequence - After a day of googling, they find information and calm down\n\nSo in this scenario the undesirable behavior is the client is panic googling about their symptoms to calm down. In ABA we would want to reinforce a coping behavior that is healthier. Some examples of healthy coping include:\n\n* Reaching out to a trusted friend\n* Removing yourself from the environment to go for a walk\n* Focusing on different activities\n\nThe RBT (registered behavioral technician) would then run trials (approved by a Clinical Director) where they would present the stimulus (medical commercial plays) at random times during session, and they would reinforce the behaviors (healthy coping mechanism) such redirecting them from googling their symptoms through different types of prompts and learning techniques (shaping or token prize systems). \n\nFor example when the medical commercial plays:\n\n* Trial 1 - Client walks to computer to google \\[ERROR\\]\n   * RBT provides ERROR CORRECTION by 'gesturing' a phone --> Client calls friend instead\n* Trial 2 - Client walks to computer to google \\[ERROR\\]\n   * RBT provides ERROR CORRECTION by 'verbally' suggesting to walk outside --> Client complies and walks outside\n* Trial 3 - Client walks towards computer, but decides to walk towards door instead \\[INDEPENDENT\\]\n   * RBT reinforces behavior by giving them their 1st token. 3 tokens are needed to redeem.\n* Trial 4 - Client walks towards phone and turns off TV to talk to friend \\[INDEPENDENT\\]\n   * RBT reinforces behavior by giving them the 2nd token.\n* Trial 5- Client walks towards door and calls friend to talk \\[INDEPENDENT\\]\n   * RBT gives last token. RBT reinforces behavior by letting client 'CASH OUT' and letting them watch their favorite show for 30 minutes during session.\n\n\\[NOW this scenario does not run through a non-compliance scenario (client gets aggressive because they cannot google symptoms), but there are many techniques as well such as RBT prompting client, waiting for client to calm down, redirecting the client with simple tasks (blink, clap, touch nose, goes back to original task of calling friend instead of googling).\\]\n\nThe overall goal is for the client to go through these trials, and eventually fade all the assistance from the RBT so that the client can become independent at managing their reaction to medical commercials.\n\nBut yeah what do you think of this non-intrusive approach to treating Health Anxiety?",

    "selftext": "My Boyfriend has Health Anxiety and I keep getting upset about it\n\nMy boyfriend (17m) and I (16f) have been dating for 9 months. I truly believe I have found the love of my life and I want to be able to help him with any issues he has. However, I grew up very isolated. My sister takes up my parents time and when they do talk to me I walk on eggshells so they don’t snap. I never had good friends so that’s the only behaviour I learned. Whenever my boyfriend comes to me with a health anxiety concern I get frustrated at him and respond how my parents would. I desperately want to fix that.\nMy boyfriend has had health anxiety (more specifically illness anxiety disorder) for the past 7 years after a choking incident. No matter what he always has a worry in his head about his health. Most of the time it’s about bacterial things like meningitis or sepsis, but he also often worries about small things, like whether a pin-sized cut is infected or more rare conditions. I also used to research poisons (was writing a book for class) and have memorized the flavours of a few, so everytime my boyfriend eats something he asks me to sample it even when it’s something I dislike to which I always oblige. I hate to say it, but sometimes I find his worries to be very strange since I’m the kind of person to just let a cut bleed dry and leave it.\nAt the beginning of our relationship I was more than understanding. I would often spend my nights researching conditions that he believed he had, finding loopholes to show him he didn’t have the conditions he thought he did. Recently however, I find myself snapping at him rather that offering comfort. I don’t snap at him out of frustration that he’s talking to me about his issues, rather that I don’t know how to properly help him. My methods of researching conditions wasn’t working, offering comfort in a hug barely comforted him, and now I’m lost and whenever he asks me for help I simply get frustrated and tell him I’m not a doctor and would have no way of knowing. I know this hurts him and I want to do better. Please help me",

    "selftext": "Hi all, I've been trying to support my friend who has health anxiety but I just don't know if what I'm doing is the right way or if I'm accidentally making it worse for her. I've just met up with her after coming back to my hometown from university after a while and she looks noticeably worse (Like more jittery)\n\nI've know her for as long as I could remember, she's always been battling with eating disorders and I'm proud of how far she's gotten through it. But the past few years, she's been worrying more and more about her health with an obsession on the types of food she should and shouldn't eat to the point that it takes over her thoughts day and night.\n\nI've made myself available to her 24/7 to call whenever her thoughts become too much but it's becoming harder and harder to keep my word since I have other responsibilities like work/university and dealing with my own issues. It's also been a lot harder for me to know how to help since I'm not chatting with her in person as much as we use to.\n\nThe last thing I want to do is make the problem worse, I give her advice like find distractions, maybe seek therapy, go on walks, listen to music, learn how to draw and tell her how proud I am. But I feel so defeated when I see her look worse and it's hard to stay positive. Are these the right things to say? And what else could I say to help her?",

    "selftext": "So I've just had a panick attack about the possibility of catching N.Fowleri, which I assume you all know well about for the past day, because I swam in a pool that I wasn't absolutely 100% certain it was perfectly chlorinated. And of course,the fact that it is \"very rare\" didn't help easy my anxiety much at all. So I tried doing the math for myself,full of worst cases.  Approximately 90 million Americans, the country with the most of these cases, go swimming, in either freshwater bodies or the ocean. So let's cut that into a quarter just to be sure, because N.Fowleri can't be found in sea water and mostly not in moving water. But that is regarding the whole USA, and N.Fowleri is mostly found in more southern states, especially Texas ,California and Florida, which makenup about 27 percent of USA population. But again,just to be sure, We will cut it down to 20.(Lowering this number will make the percentage of likelihood  go up, because we are more strict about who is actually at risk)\n\n\nN fowleri usually only has 3 cases per year, but some can go unreported,due to the rarity, and similarity of symptoms to Bacterial meningitis. So again, let's be careful. According to a source, it could be up to 16 a year.\n\n\nLet's also assume  that only  10%of those could have put their head under water and may have got it in their nose.\n\nThat puts as at.\n\nTldr.\n\n91,000,000 * 0.20 * 0.25 = 4,550,000\n(91M is people who swim, 0.2 for southern states, 0.25 for freshwater lakes)\n4,500,000 * 0.1 = 450,000\n(0.1 for People who dove their heads under the water and could have gotten water up their nose)\n\nAnd now, 16/450,000 That puts as at 0.0000356 which is about 0,0036 %. And that's assuming the absolutely worst cases.\n\nAnd now, even further , let us assume another worst case that you are extremely unlucky, so let's multiply that by 100. That is still 0,36 % out of 100%. How likely do you think that is? And that would be assuming you actually swam in a very dirty lake, which I think all of us didn't.\n\nAnd of course, sources.\n\nhttps://www.livestrong.com/article/13730813-swimming-statistics/ the amount of people who swim.\n\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/parasites/naegleria/state-map.html.  Cases of N.fowleri by state.\n\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5749439/ Here is more on the actual cases of N.Fowleri a year, which is estimated to be about 16. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother interesting statistic is this\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/swimming/publications.html.  Which says about 1 in 10 pools is improperly chlorinated. And at first, I know this may be anxiety inducing but despite that, most cases of N.Fowleri come from freshwater lakes. Imporperly chlorinated is better than not chlorinated at all, remember that.\n\nI have just spend a day having a panick attack about this, and when I look at this data, and the fact that I don't even live in the USA but Greece, where there weren't any reported case as far as I found I feel like an idiot. But the fear is still so real.",

I still struggle with health anxiety that I know is very illogical.\n\nI have personally never met anyone with health anxiety who doesn't have at least some medical trauma. I have also personally seen people who previously had zero health anxiety develop it following a medically traumatic event.\n\nI'm wondering what y'all think.

This is so redditors can gain something from your post without feeling bad that they are not where you are currently at on their own journey. The reason we do this is that Reddit is another form of social media where many can fall victim to the social comparison trap. We do not want people to feel inadequate by comparing themselves to someone else's health anxiety management journey. This is why we ask redditors to include advice in their progress updates if they want it to be a standalone thread.

This past month has been tough for me, I was convinced that I had at least 3-4 different types of cancers and just bounced around from one to the other depending on the type of \"symptoms\" I was feeling at the time. The dermotologist finding a suspicious growth on my skin didn't exactly help either (that is what kicked everything off). This has been the worst episode of prolonged HA of my life, and has led me to be prescribed an SSRI, which I may or may not continue taking (hasn't kicked in yet).\n\nToday I had a regular annual physical with my doctor, I went in nervous and left feeling the most relief that I have felt in the past month. \n\nWhat changed? Instead of focusing on what I think may be wrong, my family history of diseases, screening options, the types of labs I wanted, I instead fessed up and told her that my biggest issue is health anxiety. We ended up talking about health anxiety for 90% of my physical.\n\nWhat I understood from our talk, is that we do not give doctors enough credit. They know what they're talking about, they can tell things about your health just by looking at you and asking a few questions. I went through a list of things I read on google with my doctor and she debunked it all, confidently. She explained the reasons why certain things I read do not apply to me, and why other things are complete heresay, misinformation, or represents a statistically irrelevant number of cases. In the end I actually ran out of concerns to point out, she had fielded them all and I had nothing left. Even trying to grasp at \"what if in the future...\" were shut down by the simple reply of \"you are a healthy young man, with nothing to fear\". Sometimes that is just what we need to be told.\n\nI know it's intimidating, but I urge anyone that has not visited their doctor in some time due to fear to schedule that appointment. You don't need to do any tests, just have a talk, explain your fears, and listen to logic. It ended up being the exact thing I needed to hear.",

    "title": "Things that have been helping me with health anxiety over the last 6 months",
    "selftext": "Hello folks, \n\n**Some background:** I (31M) have been suffering from health anxiety from last 8 months now. I have been diagnosed with Costochondritis (chest pains). It all started with me able to feel my heartbeat, palpitations and later developed into full blown HA. And then the chest pains obviously increased the health anxiety. I stopped doing things that increased my heartbeat like running, playing which I really used to enjoy. \n\nFirst step was obviously visiting a doctor and getting all the tests done related to heart and chest. I got it done twice because I was so anxious that what if the first doctor didn't do a proper diagnosis. Thankfully everything came all right but obviously the symptoms were still there and with chest pains I used to have random anxiety episodes. This became an anxiety loop and I wasn't having proper sleep which was increasing the stress and then increasing the anxiety. \n\n**What I have been trying:**\n\n* First thing I did was to visit a physiotherapist who helped me with some stretching exercises to help with my Costo. I have been doing it daily for the past 3 months and have been paying much more attention to my posture. Most of my work is behind the laptop and Costo can aggravate due to bad posture. Costo is not completely gone but it has become manageable. \n* Doing mindful relaxation/meditation: I have been doing it almost 5 times a week on the Insight Timer app. It has helped me by far the most among all the things. Helped with the general anxiety or anxious feelings, general calmness, slow breathing, reduced stress etc. My sleep also became better due to this which has a huge healing effect. Once your sleep gets better, you will automatically feel calmness and less anxious. If you do this then try to pick up a course rather than doing the same meditation daily. They teach a lot of things including how to be kinder to yourself and to not judge or put yourself under pressure. \n* Read the DARE book by Barry McDonald and follow the practices he mentioned. He has suggested some very simple practices and it really works. He also suggests mindful relaxation along with multiple other things.\n* Daily walks: This has been life changing for me. I started doing daily walks for 35mins-1hour and it really took my mind off things. Try going out even if your mind says no. Force it few times and you will love it\n* Almost zero caffeine: I never liked coffee too much so this was easy for me but reducing caffeine is very important. Drink lots of water. \n\nAlong with all of the above, my partner has really helped in the whole journey. She listens to me and supports me which is really important. \n\n**Where am I in the journey**\n\nAbove stuff has been truly helpful and things are much more manageable for me right now compared to 6 months ago. Costo is not completely gone and other symptoms like palpitations, feeling the heart beat etc are there but I have trying to live with it without getting stressed. I trust that it will heal in its own time. That time could be months, years but I have accepted this truth that I need to have patience. Things will happen at their own pace and I should try to be happy, calm and live the life. Everyone has their challenges and life throws ups and downs but there is no option but to navigate it. How you react to those challenges is more important than the challenge itself. \n\nRemember there will be setbacks, lot of them, in fact I just had one setback yesterday but it wasn't as bad as before. I was able to get through it in a much better manner without worrying too much. \n\nLife is a journey and not an event so don't let this even define you. You will be fine, just have patience and keep trying. Want to add that I have tried lot of other things too but some didn't work and that's fine. It will happen and different things work for people but do try things then only you will know what works for you.\n\nHope this helps someone. ",

    "title": "Recovery Story: How turned the curse of health anxiety into a blessing.",
    "selftext": "First of all, hi! My name is Dan, and I'd suffered from OCD for 18 years, which turned into health anxiety 5 years ago. Today I will tell you my story, how it began, how it climaxed and, most importantly, how it became a tool for me to live a more authentic life. \n\nWhen I was around 8 years old, I liked playing Pokémon. Not liked, LOVED. My little monsters were everything, the quality of my days were dictated by how much progress I made in the game, if I was able to catch something new. There was a twist to all of this, however: at that time, it was not uncommon for cartridges to stop working suddenly. That HAUNTED me, I was obsessed with the idea of it to stop working and losing everything. I discovered, that, after many years, what I just told you was the beginning of my OCD. \n\nIt expressed itself in many different ways and, despite it being strong or weak, it never took the bright from living. It was until, one day, I looked in the mirror and saw a weird looking mole with a blackhead in the middle. After debating with myself, I went ahead and popped it: \"WHAT IF IT WAS C WORD'. I struggled with this thought for a couple of hours, then it went away.\n\n A year later, I had some weird results on my blood work. The number, the idea of having something wrong with me, my head was insane chaos. I was desperate for an answer (which I found), but it was too late: there was, then, always something new. Slowly, it became worse and worse. It stopped being something periodical, and became constant. For 6 months my life was nothing but an insane obsession with 0,001%s, I was not able to live properly, I had no appetite, and only thought about having a concussion or an autoimmune disease. Half of my day was spend on the HA subreddit, venting about my fears.\n\nThis is when I drew the line, I needed to do something. I started bringing this topic into my psychoanalysis sessions and doing ERP on the side, since it's not supported by the type of therapy I was doing. It was HARD. H A R D. In both schools of thought, \"treatment\" (I dislike this word) is not meant to be intuitive or fun. In fact, many psychiatrists say that ERP is the hardest therapy to do. I will now, share what helped:\n\n**What I learned with psychoanalysis**: My health anxiety, as well as my OCD, was a way of my unconscious mind to express an excessive desire of perfection, as well as the belief of its existence. Me and my therapist called it the \"circle': no sharp edges, smooth. Life, however, is not like that, it might be circular, but also have some bumps and sharp turns. I believed that I NEEDED this \"perfect life\" to be happy, and looked for it through these symbolical obsessions. Why did I have this desire? My parents hardly gave me limits, which created in me a never-ending desire for more. \n\nThis was called a core fear, often talked about in CBT. Our health anxiety is hardly ever a symptom of being afraid of truly being ill, but a fear of something rooted deep down.\n\n**What I learned with philosophy:** I started studying philosophy, and one philosopher in particular caught my eye: Friedrich Nietzsche. It is not possible to explain his school of thought properly here, it would take more than 10 pages, but one specific \"mindset\" (if you could call it that) helped me: we, as humans, refuse to live life how it is. We create conflicts, nonsensical morals, non-existing relationships, we hardly ever truly live. We are afraid of accepting the melancholy of life in its purest form. However, by being defensive about it, we also do not allow ourselves to taste its color. What does he say that we should do? AFFIRM life. Be ready, willing and happy to suffer, to have the most intense illness, and understand that it is the nature of life. Be willing to suffer and to die. \n\nI started doing \"safe unsafe\" things on purpose, like for ex going for a road trip, jumping with a parachute, or traveling to a country with no great medical care. In addition, avoiding perfection in everyday life also helped. \n\n**What I learned with ERP:** ERP, or Exposure Response Therapy, is meant to expose you to your fear in order to desensitize you from it. Sounds easy in practice, but for us, anxiety sufferers, it is more difficult. The processes is not as straight forward as for a focused phobia, for example. How do we expose ourselves if we have HA?\n\n1 - Do not google, check your lymph nodes, do not avoid the doctor, etc. Why? Because if you don't, you expose yourself to UNCERTAINTY. You might only be able to do 1%, and that's ok. Do 1% every day. Eventually, you will be able to do 2, then 5, then 10... it gets easier!\n\n2 - Do not problem solve in your head!!!!! This is a type of compulsion that we do that tries, again, to take us away from UNCERAINTY. \n\n**LOOK FOR UNCERTAINTY!** Do not accept it, **affirm** it. My view nowadays is vastly different: I see life now as an experience that has no guarantees, and that's the **nature of it**. If life brings me pain, illness, distress, that's okay, because that's what life is. I know it sounds pessimistic, but it's the complete opposite: you live more authentically. I now cherish the present moment, I feel like I \"woke up\" and every day is meaningful in its own way. \n\nWeirdly enough, I thank my OCD and HA. If it weren't them, I wouldn't be sensitive to living a lie, and would experience just \"proxies\" of my desire without retaliation from my mind. Hope you all have a wonderful day, recovery is possible and we have the opportunity to learn along the way. Sending love, you can do it!!",

Of those thoughts: 95 percent repeat each day and on average, **80 percent of repeated thoughts are negative.**\n\nThis means that on average, only 20% of our thoughts are positive per day and they are competing for our attention with the other 80%. This 80% has megaphones but you know what, **we are not helpless**.\n\n* We can help the 20% of our positive thoughts shine brighter and dominate these negative thoughts. This is where \"marinating in the positive\" and contributing to the daily positivity thread in any way you can comes into play. **Attitude is a choice.**\n\nLet's fill this thread with some positivity from our daily lives and remind ourselves that positive things are happening while we battle the negative thoughts of health anxiety. **Some examples of things you can post include:**\n\n* Examples of positive self talk that you use for yourself (which will give others ideas that they can use for themselves regarding positive self talk).\n* Ordinary things you are grateful for (ex: your car started today or there is water to drink).\n* Small goals & victories you have accomplished.\n* Something you witnessed that made you smile, or something you did to make someone else smile.\n* Blessings, gratitude, and other positive observations in your life.\n* Accomplishments of self-care.\n* Something you created today (crafts, art, a meal...).\n* Find accountability buddies and report your self progress for some type of challenge.\n* Declaration of choosing a predominantly positive attitude in regards to HA or other aspects of life.\n* Examples of mental imagery you use for yourself to prepare for situations and/or recover from errors.\n* Declaration of acknowledgement and/or acceptance of certain things in your life (ex: emotions, health anxiety, etc).\n* Declaration of using a negative experience as a stepping stone in life to improve and get closer to your goals rather than let it interfere with your progress.\n* Declaration of living life in the \"here and now\", without regard to either the past or anticipated future events.\n* Declaration of ditching perfectionism and choosing to strive for excellence instead for something in your life (ex: \"being perfect\" vs \"being good enough\").\n\n**REGARDING \"journey updates\" standalone post**: Some of you may have been redirected here if you are providing an update on your progress via a standalone post. If you would like your standalone post to be approved, please resubmit the \"update post\" with advice in the text body (such as detailing how you got there, or what motivated you to get to where you are now, etc). This is so redditors can gain something from your post without feeling bad that they are not where you are currently at on their own journey. The reason we do this is that Reddit is another form of social media where many can fall victim to the social comparison trap. We do not want people to feel inadequate by comparing themselves to someone else's health anxiety management journey. This is why we ask redditors to include advice in their progress updates if they want it to be a standalone thread. This way people can gain information for their health anxiety management roadmaps from your post. Feel free to resubmit your post with advice added on if you want it to be a standalone post. Thank you for your cooperation.\n\nRegarding memes: Please post them here as a link and please provide a description so people know what they are clicking on.

I think I've always naturally been an anxious person but over the past three years my health anxiety specifically has shot up significantly. I like to go for walks(approx about 1 and a half to 2 hours of walking most days) and I have had jabs like for tetanus, covid and meningitis etc. But it's like even though I feel \"safe\" reading that, it's almost like then I'll go on the internet and I'll find something which takes away that previous feeling of safety around my health. For example today it was going online and seeing an article saying that even if you've been vaccinated against meningitis you can still get bacterial/viral meningitis. I've often heard people say that very often with health anxiety, someone can have all the injections and vaccinations against as many illnesses as possible but it still won't take away/\"cure\" their health anxiety",

    "title": "As someone who can't drive, here's my process for when I have to convince my loved ones to actually take me to a doc for a problem that developed out of the blue",
    "selftext": "Hi, hopefully this is the right flare for this.  Don't know if this is a stigma related thing or a society related thing. I don't mean this as a \"DAE?\" post (but apologies to mods if it is, actually lol). But this is something that happens to me often. I'm 26, but live at home with my family because of my cerebral palsy, for example. I know sometimes it's hard to convince someone to actually get you to a doctor in a prompt matter (especially after a Dr. Google Spiral). And HA definitely makes it worse because you start thinking you have a limited window to get to a doc to fix \"a condition\" (that you may not even have!)  \n\n\nI've found that, if it's something that doesnt resolve itself with at home treatments, it's good to keep your loved one up to date on how you feel, and be honest about it. Currently going through that, with my mother and i trying different kinds of remedies to rule out a more mundane problem. This morning I texted her saying that it would be a good idea to go to a doctor if this doesnt sort itself out with what we're currently trying, in (hopefully) a day or 2.\n\nNote that this is of course not medical advice and it depends on your symptoms/severity of pain. I'm lucky enough to have a problem that is possibly explained away by HA for most of it, save for the one actual, provable physiological problem. lucky as well as a supportive family.   I'm also trying to distract myself as much as possible, and that definitely helps as well. I'd recommend that as well. Put on some show you like, or even a show that you don't think is *that* great but makes a good timewaster. While I'm trying to distract myself, I'm basically going through the backlog of episodes I may have missed or shows I never had the full interest in getting into when I'm at 100% lol  \n\n\nThis might only work for a few people, but if you do have a specialist you see multiple times a year, try to think about how much you trust them too. Unless your doctor is really neglectful (and hopefully you wouldn't still be seeing them if that's the case, but I've been there and it happens. Even the worst doctors I've had are still smarter than me about a lot of the ailments I face, mostly!) I'm sure they would know you the best and have mentioned the possibility of any new ailments coming up. Note that you should still make an effort to see your doc about this, or given the topic the post, communicate to whoever's driving you about that. Of course, now after the era of Covid, your doc may also do telehealth appointments, which are a godsend to me when I can use them.\n\nLastly, and to mixed results, but mostly helpful, I try to keep a genuine mental record of my symptoms. Obviously this can sometimes go wrong or make anxiety worse. But say, if I'm concerned about if a body part stopped functioning, i think of all the ways it is still functioning. This can create less of an urgency (it does for me, at least) in the meantime while your loved ones do what they have to do in their own lives.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHoped this helped someone! I'm kind of going through this myself so I thought for once this week I'd put more positivity and helpfulness into the internet, to take a break from my own doom spiraling lol. In fact, I happened to forget about all but one of the sensations that were bugging me recently (leaving only the real one!)",

This person just goes with the flow, lives very mindfully and appreciates every second of life despite having critical illness his whole life. This person dies young at the age of 40 years old. \n\nThis is a very extreme case but you get the point. Person #1 only enjoys his life for 25 years, but person #2 enjoys his life for 40 years despite living much shorter. I guess spending less time stressing out about health can make you actually \"live\" longer. So folks let's stop googling symptoms and just trust our doctors. If you think you have a disease, discuss it with your doctors, if they say it's nothing to worry about, then move on. If it is indeed a disease, follow the treatment plan. Just try your best to live a healthy life style, and the rest of it is things we can't control, so there's no need to think about them. I know it's easier to say than done, but this is the right mentality we all should work on.\n\nJust like you guys, I have health anxiety my whole life. My worst time was 2021 where I was learning and focusing on every little sensation and it ruined my life. My anxiety was off the roof and the more I google about stuff the more anxious I was. It became a viscous cycle and I needed psychiatry help. I was on Lexapro for 7 months and gradually weaned off from it. I still have health anxiety and I'm still working on it.",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone. I recently found out that a new form of treatment technique called Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) has had stellar results in patients with panic attacks (source: https://amnelson.com/2018/10/18/emdr-therapy-for-panic-attacks/#:~:text=EMDR%20(eye%20movement%20desensitization%20and,event%20or%20a%20negative%20cognition.). It is very helpful for people with PTSD, and some other mental disorders. Some doctors suggest this could be applied successfully to health anxiety cases (source: https://www.lewispsy.org.uk/resources/health-anxiety/#:~:text=EMDR%20for%20health%20anxiety&text=EMDR%20processing%20can%20be%20applied,and%20prepare%20for%20future%20experiences.) to disarm triggers and avoidance behaviors, among other aspects of the disorder.\nI haven’t tried it for myself but I figured it was worthwhile sharing it in here. It is still a fairly new treatment, but it might just be what works for some treatment-resistant people or just people with more severe cases of the disorder.\nFor anyone particularly struggling with health anxiety, you could talk to your therapist about this.\nHope this helps :)",

I had some very real health problems I was dealing with, but my anxiety made them feel like life sentences.  I could barely function, and was desperate for help.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI noticed that any normal \"anxiety\"-based therapies did not help my health anxiety.  If anything, they worsened it.  Stuff like meditation, talking about it, writing about it, etc.  It made my anxiety far worse.  I knew that OCD ran in my family and I had small compulsions in my life, but I didn't realize that there is something called Pure-O.  \n\n\nBasically, this type of OCD means you have compulsions and rituals (much like washing your hands) but they're all mental.  For us with health anxiety, that means you might have an intrusive thought about your health and will immediately need to \"cleanse\" your mind by googling or asking someone for reassurance.  Do you notice that you feel some relief, temporarily, but then the thought comes back and usually stronger after some time?  That's OCD.  That's the exact feeling someone has when they feel the need to constantly wash their hands.  They just *need* to clean their hands physically, the same way you *need* someone to tell you that you're going to be ok.  \n\n\nLuckily, treating OCD is simple though difficult to achieve.  You can look into Exposure and Response therapy and all the other OCD therapies, but really it comes down to this - don't act on your thoughts.  Don't create secondary thoughts from them.  Definitely don't google or ask for reassurance.  Just let your thought come into your head, and immediately try to focus your attention elsewhere.  Don't even try to force the thought out.  Any type of \"interaction\" with the thought isn't going to help.  Just let it stay there, and eventually, it'll leave.\n\nIt feels difficult at first ,but over time you'll have a ton of practice.  I still have good days and bad days, but my bad days are few and far between whereas they were 90% of my waking life before.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou're going to be ok :)",

Of those thoughts: 95 percent repeat each day and on average, **80 percent of repeated thoughts are negative.**\n\nThis means that on average, only 20% of our thoughts are positive per day and they are competing for our attention with the other 80%. This 80% has megaphones but you know what, **we are not helpless**.\n\n* We can help the 20% of our positive thoughts shine brighter and dominate these negative thoughts. This is where \"marinating in the positive\" and contributing to the daily positivity thread in any way you can comes into play. **Attitude is a choice.**\n\nLet's fill this thread with some positivity from our daily lives and remind ourselves that positive things are happening while we battle the negative thoughts of health anxiety. **Some examples of things you can post include:**\n\n* Examples of positive self talk that you use for yourself (which will give others ideas that they can use for themselves regarding positive self talk).\n* Ordinary things you are grateful for (ex: your car started today or there is water to drink).\n* Small goals & victories you have accomplished.\n* Something you witnessed that made you smile, or something you did to make someone else smile.\n* Blessings, gratitude, and other positive observations in your life.\n* Accomplishments of self-care.\n* Something you created today (crafts, art, a meal...).\n* Find accountability buddies and report your self progress for some type of challenge.\n* Declaration of choosing a predominantly positive attitude in regards to HA or other aspects of life.\n* Examples of mental imagery you use for yourself to prepare for situations and/or recover from errors.\n* Declaration of acknowledgement and/or acceptance of certain things in your life (ex: emotions, health anxiety, etc).\n* Declaration of using a negative experience as a stepping stone in life to improve and get closer to your goals rather than let it interfere with your progress.\n* Declaration of living life in the \"here and now\", without regard to either the past or anticipated future events.\n* Declaration of ditching perfectionism and choosing to strive for excellence instead for something in your life (ex: \"being perfect\" vs \"being good enough\").\n\n**REGARDING \"journey updates\" standalone post**: Some of you may have been redirected here if you are providing an update on your progress via a standalone post. If you would like your standalone post to be approved, please resubmit the \"update post\" with advice in the text body (such as detailing how you got there, or what motivated you to get to where you are now, etc). This is so redditors can gain something from your post without feeling bad that they are not where you are currently at on their own journey. The reason we do this is that Reddit is another form of social media where many can fall victim to the social comparison trap. We do not want people to feel inadequate by comparing themselves to someone else's health anxiety management journey. This is why we ask redditors to include advice in their progress updates if they want it to be a standalone thread. This way people can gain information for their health anxiety management roadmaps from your post. Feel free to resubmit your post with advice added on if you want it to be a standalone post. Thank you for your cooperation.\n\nRegarding memes: Please post them here as a link and please provide a description so people know what they are clicking on. Like everything on social media something that is seen funny by one person can be triggering for another person. Please keep your subreddit members safe by providing a brief description of the meme you are sharing.",

    "title": "How I’ve been unarming health anxiety thoughts",
    "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI’ve been in this health anxiety loop for over 10 years now. It started as a low-level anxiety, over the years evolved into full blown 24/7 panic attack loop, with the peak being a full day of me going to ER and back home a few times to make sure my heart is okay. After that, I knew I had to learn to cope and each new anxiety period became much more bearable. So I want to share with you some things that helped me. You might have heard some of these before but I’ve also added a little twist to them that helped me a ton.\n\n1. If you can’t help but Google, better to look up actual medical publications (NCBI) and read those publications end-to-end. Because there you can see realistic picture of a bunch of bombastic newspaper headlines which are made to scare you. If you were to read the actual paper referenced in those articles you would see that there are major problems with sampling or how it was conducted etc. and that you can’t look into one aspect in medicine without considering everything else. If you find them too hard to read that probably should tell you how complex each disease is and how having one symptom or even multiple doesn’t mean chance of a disease.\n\n2. Being active in this subreddit. I have mostly been lurker and only commented a few times when I saw my insight could help a bunch and it always did help! I’m supremely introverted so if I could do 2-3 comments over the years anyone can! It’ll help you show yourself how much progress you’ve done since you are now in position to help others even.\n\n3. Keeping the detailed journal of every sensation and my anxiety over that sensation and making it easily searchable. I kid you not, in 90% of cases I thought I was experiencing something completely new I found an entry from like 7 years ago with matching description. We seem to always give more credit to what we are feeling right now and forget how horrible something felt previously.\n\nMy twist on all of these: I’m an AI engineer so I made a chatbot of my experience and experiences of people in this subreddit, along with some flaw-finding for “studies”. It allowed me to talk with my previous self and others in my position basically instead of having to search for similar symptoms.\n\nNow, I’m really bad at organization but good at programming which is why this worked for me but you can probably get similar results just by organizing all your thoughts and other peoples thoughts very well to make it searchable.\n\nI might also be willing to make this sort of bot for wider audience but only if there’s overwhelming majority asking for it as it’s a lot of work to do if it won’t help far and wide people beat this fear.\n\nWhat I just want to reiterate is that things get better. It might seem dark now and you might have a setback but over a longer period they do improve and I haven’t had panic attacks as bad as I did before for some 3 years now ☀️",

I want to not care and not think about it but the idea that I might miss something that could be really bad and could have been treatable if I caught it sooner makes me feel like I need to check absolutely everything and worry about everything… I don’t want to feel like this anymore it’s so hard to deal with every single day",

This is where \"marinating in the positive\" and contributing to the daily positivity thread in any way you can comes into play. **Attitude is a choice.**\n\nLet's fill this thread with some positivity from our daily lives and remind ourselves that positive things are happening while we battle the negative thoughts of health anxiety. **Some examples of things you can post include:**\n\n* Examples of positive self talk that you use for yourself (which will give others ideas that they can use for themselves regarding positive self talk).\n* Ordinary things you are grateful for (ex: your car started today or there is water to drink).\n* Small goals & victories you have accomplished.\n* Something you witnessed that made you smile, or something you did to make someone else smile.\n* Blessings, gratitude, and other positive observations in your life.\n* Accomplishments of self-care.\n* Something you created today (crafts, art, a meal...).\n* Find accountability buddies and report your self progress for some type of challenge.\n* Declaration of choosing a predominantly positive attitude in regards to HA or other aspects of life.\n* Examples of mental imagery you use for yourself to prepare for situations and/or recover from errors.\n* Declaration of acknowledgement and/or acceptance of certain things in your life (ex: emotions, health anxiety, etc).\n* Declaration of using a negative experience as a stepping stone in life to improve and get closer to your goals rather than let it interfere with your progress.\n* Declaration of living life in the \"here and now\", without regard to either the past or anticipated future events.\n* Declaration of ditching perfectionism and choosing to strive for excellence instead for something in your life (ex: \"being perfect\" vs \"being good enough\").\n\n**REGARDING \"journey updates\" standalone post**: Some of you may have been redirected here if you are providing an update on your progress via a standalone post. If you would like your standalone post to be approved, please resubmit the \"update post\" with advice in the text body (such as detailing how you got there, or what motivated you to get to where you are now, etc). This is so redditors can gain something from your post without feeling bad that they are not where you are currently at on their own journey. The reason we do this is that Reddit is another form of social media where many can fall victim to the social comparison trap. We do not want people to feel inadequate by comparing themselves to someone else's health anxiety management journey. This is why we ask redditors to include advice in their progress updates if they want it to be a standalone thread. This way people can gain information for their health anxiety management roadmaps from your post. Feel free to resubmit your post with advice added on if you want it to be a standalone post. Thank you for your cooperation.\n\nRegarding memes: Please post them here as a link and please provide a description so people know what they are clicking on. Like everything on social media something that is seen funny by one person can be triggering for another person.

    "title": "PSA: Health Anxiety and OCD are very similar issues. Treating OCD is different from normal anxiety. Here's some tips.",
    "selftext": " I posted this a year ago, but wanted to repost it.  Ultimately, I had *real*  health problems that my OCD/HA exacerbated.  Luckily, I was able to get  the \"all-clear\" from a doctor, but I had to do a lot of work in the  months leading up to that to curb my anxiety, and I approached it all  from a lens of OCD.\n\nThe  problem  with OCD is that you see it portrayed in the media as  quirkiness, being  obsessed with order, etc.  That's actually just a very  small subset of  OCD.  There's so many more \"versions\" of OCD that no  one talks about,  and because of that, people don't realize it's OCD  unless they're  washing their hands/turning light switches, or otherwise suffering (as we with HA do on a daily basis).\n\nHealth-anxiety  is actually considered a type of OCD.  Other types being  contamination-OCD (fear of touching something or being contaminated),  Sexual-OCD (Worrying about your sexual orientation and what you might be  attracted to), Checking-OCD (needing to check the stove is off, you  have your keys, etc.  This is the most well known OCD and is often how  OCD is portrayed in media), Relationship-OCD (worrying if you love your  partner, if they're being faithful, if you're good enough for them,  etc.)\n\nBasically OCD boils down to  this - you are highly afraid of something or a state of being, you  consider this state of being incredibly bad if not the *worst possible thing that can happen to you*,  so you create a system in order to reassure yourself that this isn't  true.  For checkers that can mean checking the stove 18 times before you  leave, if it's off 18 times, than that's good.  Except after a week,  your brain goes \"well let's do it 19 times just to be sure\".  For us  with health anxiety that means googling symptoms, asking relatives for  guidance, constant doctor tests or even *avoiding* doctors for fear of what they tell you.\n\nThe   most helpful resources about OCD  I found are from Dr. Michael   Greenberg.  He has a few very short and simple articles about OCD, but   they are **the** most   helpful thing I've read for my health anxiety.  I can't stress that you   should read them even if you just have minor health anxiety, as they  may  help you.  [https://drmichaeljgreenberg.com/articles/](https://drmichaeljgreenberg.com/articles/)\n\nAs   for my story, I had a run of semi-worrisome medical issues in the last  year.  I always had health anxiety but this turned it up to 11.  I met  with a new therapist in the fall and finally admitted to  myself that I  may actually suffer from mild/moderate OCD.  It runs in  my family, I  always knew I had tendencies, but I always was too ashamed  to admit  that it actually was a huge part of my anxieties as well.\n\nI  had two triggers in the last year and basically spent the next month or  two going down a rabbit hole of anxiety.  Not sleeping, checking my  poop constantly, calling friends who are in the health field, seeing  multiple doctors, on multiple subreddits (also a bad idea btw), severely  changing every aspect of my life to lessen my anxiety, etc.\n\nNo   matter what I did, though, I couldn't calm my fear down.  I kept  trying  to find some smidgen of evidence that would put me at ease.  The   problem was that even when I found the piece of information I wanted,  my  brain would immediately discredit it and try to find something else.   I  was chasing the dragon, and never getting to where I wanted to be.\n\nOver   the ups and downs of the last few months, I started to really notice   similarities between my emotions and anxieties, and that of someone with   OCD.  I read article after article, not about my health, but about  OCD.   I felt understood, and heard, for the first time.  Turns out  health  anxiety is a form of OCD, just as the person who washes their  hands  frequently, or has to close and reopen doors constantly.  It's  just that  the routines and the compulsions are *mental* and not physical.  I had no idea that was a thing.\n\nYou might have OCD if your health anxiety does the following:\n\nYou could be watching TV, not focused on anything else, out of nowhere you get a thought.\n\n\"Oh wait, I never checked out that bump on my leg\"\n\nYou *immediately*   feel a wave of panic, you start sweating, you feel cold.  You feel  like  the world is ending, like your seconds from death.  It sounds  stupid  now, but in the moment it feels so incredibly real.\n\nThis is your intrusive thought.\n\nYour next response is to check the lump.  Push it.  Prod it.  Shine a flashlight on it.  Look at it in different mirrors.\n\nThis is a compulsion.\n\nIt's   not enough, your fear is getting worse.  You hop onto your phone and   start frantically googling. \"Lump on leg\" \"signs of melanoma\"  \"lump   on leg?\" \"symptoms of bone growths\" \"Symptoms of  hypo-thyroidism\"  etc. etc.\n\nThis is another compulsion.\n\nEventually   you're exhausted.  Your spent.  The adrenaline is gone and you're just  terrified and anxious.  You slowly recover and try to live your life  again.   Only to have the entire cycle repeat.\n\nJust   like the person who touched a door knob and needs to wash their hands   endlessly.  You are hit with an anxious thought and need to \"cleanse\"   your anxiety by finding evidence that will tell you you're ok.  However,   just like with the hand washer, just once isn't enough.  Your brain   requires more and more and more until your hands are bleeding or your   mind is a mess.\n\nThis is OCD, and the sooner you start treating your HA like this, the better.  I promise.\n\nI   have so much more to say, but I think the articles I listed above will   be far more helpful.  I'm also more than happy to add more or answer  any  questions.\n\nBe well, friends.  You're going to be ok.",

If it gets worse I will take action. If it stays the same or gets better I'll move onto the next step.\n\nStep 2. 3 hours - If I've already waited 3 minutes, or if the symptom I'm thinking about doesn't need an immediate response, I will then wait 3 hours. Again, if during this time I get worse, I'll take action. If I stay the same or improve, I'll move to step 3.\n\nStep 3. 3 days - by this point I've ruled out immediate danger and I'm trying to work out if a doctors trip is in order. So again, if it gets worse I'll book an appointment. If it stays the same or getter better I move onto the last step.\n\nStep 4. 3 Weeks - so if I've got here there are 2 options. If any symptoms are still present I will go and get them seen to. If by this point everything has settled down, then I'll leave it.\n\n\nI hope this helps someone!",

    "selftext": "I really didn't find a great \"tag\" for this topic, but I hope this suffices. \n\nMy partner has zero HA, and deals with stress in general by suppressing it and not expressing their feelings.  I'm not saying it's great - they're working on being more in-touch with their emotions - but it certainly different from my way, which is to want to express my feelings and talk about my fears.\n\nThis results in two things that I don't see a lot of people discuss: 1) the feeling that I ought to silence myself and suffer alone so as not to be a burden on/a bother to my partner.  But also 2) the damage I can see that  I do when I worry aloud to my partner that I might be seriously ill and die young.  They're so phelgmatic that they seem to take it in stride but it comes out later that this hurts them, that it's in some ways torturous to them, because someone they love is constantly making them think about having to lose them.  Problem 2 (causing pain and distress) feeds into problem 1 (feeling like one ought to be silent and alone in their HA) creating a truly unpleasant feedback loop.\n\nHA can be bad for relationships.  Whether you're telling your spouse or your sibling or your best friend that you're dying three times a year... that takes a toll on that person.  And if you bottle it up and keep it to yourself, sometimes it feels very lonely and alone, and like you're such an awful person you oughtn't be allowed to talk about your feelings at all.  Both are pretty bad places to be.\n\nI don't know if any of you experience these things in your relationships, but I wanted to bring up the conversation in case some of you needed someplace to talk about it.  Because that's what I think the answer is: finding a therapist you can unload your crazy into (it won't be as likely to hurt them or your relationship with them, because that's their job, and although they \\[ideally\\] care about you, they also aren't wounded by every time you think you're dying) and/or be here.  Venting to internet strangers is relatively safe, at least in terms of interpersonal relationships.  We're all suffering here to some degree, and we're not going to judge you.\n\nAll the other usual HA stuff does still apply, re: seeking reassurance (it's not great for you), but I think even just talking it out and venting here and/or in therapy can be really helpful.  And to the point: it can help your interpersonal relationships, saving your interactions with those you love for only your most dire concerns and otherwise freeing you to enjoy them and let them enjoy you!\n\nThoughts, feelings, worries, and all discussion welcome!",

We decided that we'd have my psychiatrist be the voice of authority as to whether or not I'm really dealing with an unknown mental condition. \n\nAs for coping strategies (aside from taking my meds), I find it comforting to just read about characters struggling similarly to me. I related a lot to Aza Holmes in turtles all the way down by John Green, she obsessed more over physical illness but I related to her thoughts. Be careful with this if you get triggered by reading about these sorts of thoughts, though.\n\nI also find comfort in learning more about my disorder, not just because I'm a bit of a geek for learning about mental disorders and the human brain but also because I like knowing I'm not alone, plus it helps me understand my disorder better. I no longer go on Reddit on separate accounts asking about my thoughts or weird habits and whether or not they make me psychotic, depressed, or whatever. I had an embarrassing amount of accounts for the sole purpose of feeding into my disorder. I make it a rule to not go online and ask about my symptoms, as that tends to make things worse.

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,  \nI have OCD, and a lot of it revolves around HA. I wrote a post about my experiences being diagnosed with OCD in this post if folks are interested in reading it [https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/hlcwte/if\\_you\\_have\\_ha\\_you\\_might\\_have\\_ocd/](https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/hlcwte/if_you_have_ha_you_might_have_ocd/)\n\nFor Anxiety and OCD, I have done years of CBT and ERP therapy.  I have done some sessions of EMDR therapy and made excellent strides.   \nI am a survivor of childhood trauma (emotionally immature parents with severe mental health problems, parent and child roles were reversed). I also experienced a lot of death and disease around me. In addition to that my folks didn't really look after their health, or were in poor health.   \n\n\nI've recently had a challenge / trigger come up when I went to do a routine Pap screening and my doctor examining me said 'hmmm'. She noticed a spot that looked slightly grey but didn't say it looked like the C word. Asking if I was having discharge (which I was and is normal for me at this part of my cycle). Obviously, it sent my mind into a complete tailspin. She seemed really non-challant and said  we'd just wait till the test comes back. In Canada it takes 6-weeks. \n\nNow that I have all these tools at my disposal with therapy I could actually review how my mind was viewing the situation (even though I am still experiencing anxiety).\n\nFirst off my thoughts said - this is really bad, you have the C word, this is the big thing /sign / even you've been waiting for, this time is different UH OH, HERE WE GO.  \nI was able to immediately challenge my thoughts with my CBT training. I didn't google the issue. Instead I came to this reddit and looked at other instances of ppl who had HA around similar concerns.\n\nI have now done a bunch of journalling on this issue (I have kept a mental health journal for the past 3 years which has been immensely helpful). After doing the EMDR too, I have begun to notice some themes\n\n1. The only thing I'm really sick with is OCD and anxiety. This feeling of sick and dying is more related to those thoughts than anything real or tangible (or purely physical).\n2. I possess so much hyper responsibility (very common with OCD). My thoughts are saying 'I should have had this checked sooner', I should have somehow known, I dropped the ball, I have messed myself up.  It's also what drives the body checking and scanning. Ex: small muscle twinge = big  fatal health problem. THoughst are saying: If you don't take that little twinge seriously - you have messed up big time. Get to the doctor ASAP. \n3. Hypervigilance - common with OCD and with trauma. in my specific circumstance as a kid and young adult my home life was chaotic and stressful. I learned to always be on the look out for problems> The brains way of trying to control a disturbing situation. In some ways it is being creative, looking for every day things to latch onto so it doesn't have to deal with the big bad things that were happening. I continued this cycle as an adult bc it was my way of surviving as a young person. \n4. My mind is saying - Don't trust the good feelings - be prepared - always for the bad. The good and positive or neutral stuff is risky because the other shoe is going to drop so fast and you better be prepared. This connects to hypervigilance big time, but is almost a negative self-belief. If you prepare for the worst you'll never be let down.\n5. Perfectionism. Body must be perfect. Never in pain, have any bumps, do odd things or quirks. Anythign less than this means something is really bad.\n\nI feel like a lot of these types of thoughts could be totally applicable to someone without trauma. In my case it was amplified by that. I also thing that HA itself and what our minds go through is a form of trauma in and of itself.   \nNot sure how much these resonate with others, but wanted to drop my 2 cents.  \nI also want to let ppl know that even though I've come really far, I'm still having a setback and I think that is normal. I know with OCD, it is a chronic condition. You can get long stretches where you feel cured and then it rears up again. I am hopeful with all the tools and therapy and I minimize the impact a bit.",

If you would like your standalone post to be approved, please resubmit the \"update post\" with advice in the text body (such as detailing how you got there, or what motivated you to get to where you are now, etc). This is so redditors can gain something from your post without feeling bad that they are not where you are currently at on their own journey. The reason we do this is that Reddit is another form of social media where many can fall victim to the social comparison trap. We do not want people to feel inadequate by comparing themselves to someone else's health anxiety management journey. This is why we ask redditors to include advice in their progress updates if they want it to be a standalone thread. This way people can gain information for their health anxiety management roadmaps from your post. Feel free to resubmit your post with advice added on if you want it to be a standalone post.

    "selftext": "(English is not my first language, sorry for the mistakes) \nA couple of months ago I had very bad health anxiety. It basically effected my whole life and I was anxious all the time. After seeking help from my doctor I’ve managed to overcome it eventually. Here are some of the most important things that helped me : \n\n1. DON’T GOOGLE. This is the most common advice there is, but that doesn’t make it any less true. Even though you’ve convinced yourself looking on the internet doesn’t make your anxiety worse, it does. The internet always shows you the worst possibilities of what is going on. Even reading reassuring articles can cause more anxiety because of certain trigger words. Just try to go an hour or even a whole day without google, you will feel much better already. \n\n2. What helped me the most was looking at statistics. I was anxious all the time about having certain types of illnesses, but when I discovered how small the odds eventually where it calmed me down. Try to find numbers of how many people your age actually get a certain type of sickness, and you will realise the chance of having something bad is actually very very small. \n\n3. Go for a walk or do a different activity that forces you to move your body. Your brain can trick you into feeling all kinds of things that are not actually there. This gets worse when you focus on what you are feeling. Try to think of different things. Think about “what do I see?” “What do I smell?” “What do I hear?”  Just don’t focus on the feelings in your body. \n\nJust remember that your anxiety isn’t rational thinking! You know you are not sick. Don’t trick yourself into believing otherwise.",

Of those thoughts: 95 percent repeat each day and on average, **80 percent of repeated thoughts are negative.**\n\nThis means that on average, only 20% of our thoughts are positive per day and they are competing for our attention with the other 80%. This 80% has megaphones but you know what, **we are not helpless**.\n\n* We can help the 20% of our positive thoughts shine brighter and dominate these negative thoughts. This is where \"marinating in the positive\" and contributing to the daily positivity thread in any way you can comes into play. **Attitude is a choice.**\n\nLet's fill this thread with some positivity from our daily lives and remind ourselves that positive things are happening while we battle the negative thoughts of health anxiety. **Some examples of things you can post include:**\n\n* Examples of positive self talk that you use for yourself (which will give others ideas that they can use for themselves regarding positive self talk).\n* Ordinary things you are grateful for (ex: your car started today or there is water to drink).\n* Small goals & victories you have accomplished.\n* Something you witnessed that made you smile, or something you did to make someone else smile.\n* Blessings, gratitude, and other positive observations in your life.\n* Accomplishments of self-care.\n* Something you created today (crafts, art, a meal...).\n* Find accountability buddies and report your self progress for some type of challenge.\n* Declaration of choosing a predominantly positive attitude in regards to HA or other aspects of life.\n* Examples of mental imagery you use for yourself to prepare for situations and/or recover from errors.\n* Declaration of acknowledgement and/or acceptance of certain things in your life (ex: emotions, health anxiety, etc).\n* Declaration of using a negative experience as a stepping stone in life to improve and get closer to your goals rather than let it interfere with your progress.\n* Declaration of living life in the \"here and now\", without regard to either the past or anticipated future events.\n* Declaration of ditching perfectionism and choosing to strive for excellence instead for something in your life (ex: \"being perfect\" vs \"being good enough\").\n\n**REGARDING \"journey updates\" standalone post**: Some of you may have been redirected here if you are providing an update on your progress via a standalone post. If you would like your standalone post to be approved, please resubmit the \"update post\" with advice in the text body (such as detailing how you got there, or what motivated you to get to where you are now, etc). This is so redditors can gain something from your post without feeling bad that they are not where you are currently at on their own journey. The reason we do this is that Reddit is another form of social media where many can fall victim to the social comparison trap. We do not want people to feel inadequate by comparing themselves to someone else's health anxiety management journey. This is why we ask redditors to include advice in their progress updates if they want it to be a standalone thread. This way people can gain information for their health anxiety management roadmaps from your post. Feel free to resubmit your post with advice added on if you want it to be a standalone post. Thank you for your cooperation.\n\nRegarding memes: Please post them here as a link and please provide a description so people know what they are clicking on. Like everything on social media something that is seen funny by one person can be triggering for another person. Please keep your subreddit members safe by providing a brief description of the meme you are sharing.",

For me, I've thought about how the possibility of me feeling as if I don't have very long to live affects my ability to have patience with myself, and thus this often leads to other tendencies and emotions, such as perfectionism which in turn leads to procrastination or a general unenjoyment of things I love/previously enjoyed. Or perhaps you feel as if there is no use in accomplishing anything if you feel you're not going to live for very long anyway, so in turn you just don't prioritize achieving things that you'd otherwise like to achieve. \n\nI am just at a place in my life right now where I struggle with some of these feelings, and in order to understand myself better and my behaviors, I like to think about things like this.

Common for us, I suppose. Instead of worry about losing my job or my kid getting hurt, certainly more likely to happen than ALS, I constantly check my toungue for twitching. I constantly squeeze my hand muscles for atrophy. I know they both won't happen at the same time even if I had it, yet I do these behaviors constantly throughout the day.\n\nCar won't start? Check the battery or replace a key fob. Sucks but I can move on and not ruminate. Wake up with a dry mouth and tongue in the winter? Spend 15 minutes with a relaxed toungue checking for fasticulations. Then googlings to see if other people have a wavy toungue. Is that alright toungue depression atrophy? Better do some toungue exercises to check. Everything fine? Better do it again in an hour and record myself to verify. Slight twitch noticed. Was that me breathing or somethjng so worse? Better keep investigating.\n\nSee. Why HA?\n\nWhat's the science behind this?",

That’s the crazy thing about the brain- it can manifest pain. It can also get rid of pain. \n\nOne of the things that has really helped me solve chronic symptoms (which for me was a major trigger of health anxiety), was somatic awareness. More specifically, the Feldenkrais method. \n\nI wanted to attack a free archive of a bunch of Feldenkrais audio that you can lay down and do the next time you’re having symptoms.

    "selftext": "The purpose of this discussion is to request tools/resources that you wish that existed, and that can help you manage your relationship with health anxiety so that it does not get in the way of your life. Basically putting your ideas out there, so that someone who has the skills to do so may make these things we think of if they choose to do so.\n\nSome that I thought of:\n\n* A movie reviewer who makes a list of movies that will not trigger someone with health anxiety. They could also highlight if a movie talks about something that might trigger someone with health anxiety.\n   * I am imagining that this website would be similar to Rotten Tomatoes, but people with HA can go to this website to scout out if the movie would trigger them or not. Kind of like a weather forecast but for movies.\n* A youtuber/influencer who discusses a health issue or event can have a QR code appear during the time they mention the triggering information. That QR code will take their viewer to a chat center trained to help people calm down from their panic attacks triggered by HA.\n   * This is a small addition with a very big impact because I think when we are panicking it is very hard to think about what resources we might need at the moment, or what to even do to help us calm down. So just having that QR code one scan away to a chat center would be a big help. (Of course we need to accommodate those without a smart phone as well, so maybe put a phone number on the screen that people can text to get help).\n* An author decides to put a trigger warning a page before the actual discussion of illness or disease. Basically you would turn the page, and you would see \"the next page contains talks of \\_\\_\\_, please skip to page \\_\\_\\_ if you wish to proceed without being triggered\".\n   * This is so people can still go into a book without any spoilers, and still dodge triggering things. Reading is both fun and immersive, so having something like this warning would really maintain that fun for someone with HA.\n* A programmer makes an add-on extension for your browser that asks if you need to talk to somebody after viewing something mentioning health or illness. It would be activated if a trigger word appears on your screen.\n   * So imagine scrolling on Twitter, and you pass by a tweet that mention something trigger for someone with HA. The extension will recognize those triggering words, and would activate. If you click \"yes I was triggered\", the extension will automatically connect you to a chat center that  helps people calm down from panic attacks. This extension would activate from anything like news, advertisements, social media, research, and anything else online.\n\nThose are some ideas that could happen today if someone really wanted to execute them. All of the ideas tackle specific hobbies (movies, reading, watching influencers, browsing the internet), so that the hobbies can be a source of fun and not potential distress. Do you guys have another other ideas of tools/resources that you wish existed?",

    "selftext": "There has been a lot of portrayals of different utopia and dystopias in media focusing on certain things, and it made me think about a world full of people with HA and how that world might look like with a focus on making their lives easier.\n\nBecause of our experiences with health anxiety, we see things that people without this extra mental appendage would not see. So if you were the leader of this hypothetical society, what would be some laws/regulation you would pass to help everyone at different levels of vulnerability?\n\nFor example I would pass:\n\n**1st Law - Billboards about health and illnesses are banned from high traffic areas**\n\n* For me I am okay with advertising of health and illnesses when they are in the comfort of my own home. I can always change the channel, mute the TV, click out of the website, and etc. If I do get triggered, I can at least deal with the panic without having to operate a motor vehicle or embarrass myself in public . In contrast to when you see these billboards and you are trapped in traffic that is not moving. You cannot walk away from your car, the billboard sits right in the field of vision, cannot close your eyes due to driving, and really traffic can give you a lot of time to think. By the time the traffic moves pass the billboard, you already anxious. You don't want someone anxious driving a car at that point, and may even need to pull over until the panic passes.\n   * So the purpose of this law is so people do not get triggered outside of the home (which is challenging to deal with compared to the comfort of your home), and also so you don't trigger someone while they are driving.\n\n**2nd Law - Movies must include trigger warnings if the movie contains a scene focused on health or illnesses.**\n\n* For many of us movies are watched for enjoyment and relaxation. Some of us watch them with our families or we are going on a date. Movies are something you avoid spoilers for, and so you cannot prepare for scenes that may trigger you. So now instead of enjoyment and relaxation, you are now in a state of panic with your family or date. The trigger warning would be located near the age rating (Ex: PG-13, contains talks about \\[insert disease/illness/condition\\])\n   * The purpose of this law is so people can get the most out of their money and time when they are relaxing. People pay for a movie to have fun, and not find distress. At the same time people shouldn't need to rob themselves the experience of going into a movie blind by looking up the synopsis to look for potentially triggering things. So just a simple \"*movie contains talks about \\_\\_\\_\"* would be enough to make an informed decision of whether or not to choose that movie to watch.\n\nThat is just some examples of a hypothetical law. Again it is these little things that only the health anxiety community can see because of who we are, and it is tackling these little miscellaneous things where it accumulates to overall help for all in this hypothetical society.",

Take the time to comment on each other's entries to show some support while we traverse through HA together. \n\nOnly post a standalone thread if it mainly includes the mental aspect of Health Anxiety. **Everything else goes in this thread.** This megathread is used to prevent any unnecessary distress on somebody who is not mentally prepared to engage with the above content (Imagine scrolling down on your main general feed to relax, but bump into something distressing instead). HA is very unique in which it is very easy for someone to read something/experiences and then come out thinking you may have something after reading it.

Of those thoughts: 95 percent repeat each day and on average, **80 percent of repeated thoughts are negative.**\n\nThis means that on average, only 20% of our thoughts are positive per day and they are competing for our attention with the other 80%. This 80% has megaphones but you know what, **we are not helpless**.\n\n* We can help the 20% of our positive thoughts shine brighter and dominate these negative thoughts. This is where \"marinating in the positive\" and contributing to the daily positivity thread in any way you can comes into play. **Attitude is a choice.**\n\nLet's fill this thread with some positivity from our daily lives and remind ourselves that positive things are happening while we battle the negative thoughts of health anxiety. **Some examples of things you can post include:**\n\n* Examples of positive self talk that you use for yourself (which will give others ideas that they can use for themselves regarding positive self talk).\n* Ordinary things you are grateful for (ex: your car started today or there is water to drink).\n* Small goals & victories you have accomplished.\n* Something you witnessed that made you smile, or something you did to make someone else smile.\n* Blessings, gratitude, and other positive observations in your life.\n* Accomplishments of self-care.\n* Something you created today (crafts, art, a meal...).\n* Find accountability buddies and report your self progress for some type of challenge.\n* Declaration of choosing a predominantly positive attitude in regards to HA or other aspects of life.\n* Examples of mental imagery you use for yourself to prepare for situations and/or recover from errors.\n* Declaration of acknowledgement and/or acceptance of certain things in your life (ex: emotions, health anxiety, etc).\n* Declaration of using a negative experience as a stepping stone in life to improve and get closer to your goals rather than let it interfere with your progress.\n* Declaration of living life in the \"here and now\", without regard to either the past or anticipated future events.\n* Declaration of ditching perfectionism and choosing to strive for excellence instead for something in your life (ex: \"being perfect\" vs \"being good enough\").\n\n**REGARDING \"journey updates\" standalone post**: Some of you may have been redirected here if you are providing an update on your progress via a standalone post. If you would like your standalone post to be approved, please resubmit the \"update post\" with advice in the text body (such as detailing how you got there, or what motivated you to get to where you are now, etc). This is so redditors can gain something from your post without feeling bad that they are not where you are currently at on their own journey. The reason we do this is that Reddit is another form of social media where many can fall victim to the social comparison trap. We do not want people to feel inadequate by comparing themselves to someone else's health anxiety management journey. This is why we ask redditors to include advice in their progress updates if they want it to be a standalone thread. This way people can gain information for their health anxiety management roadmaps from your post. Feel free to resubmit your post with advice added on if you want it to be a standalone post. Thank you for your cooperation.\n\nRegarding memes: Please post them here as a link and please provide a description so people know what they are clicking on. Like everything on social media something that is seen funny by one person can be triggering for another person.

My anxiety found something to chew on. I was a nervous and sad wreck over Christmas. And now I even tried to find a diagnosis on Reddit. It's funny, because my one (!!!) symptom is probably due to my already diagnosed illness (which I can totally live with) and/or stress. Therefore, I don't really need a diagnosis, but I can't stop worrying. Now I've found this Sub (instead of a diagnosis) and realized I'm not alone and I'm thinking irrational and I will not die. It's really crazy how far health anxiety can push oneself. And it all started with one quick Google search.\n\nSo I guess what I'm trying to say is: \n\n1. Stop feeding your anxiety with dumb Google searches. Let it starve.\n\n2. You're not alone. This sub is a great example for it. \n\n3. You're thinking irrational. Talk to someone you're close with about your worries for reassurance.\n\n3. Everything will be okay. It has always been, and it will always be.",

So during the exercise tell yourself you are in control by saying:\n      * \"I will only move my hands once the timer rings\"\n      * \"The timer will eventually ring, it is only 5 minutes, I saw the timer counting down\"\n   * When you have the urge to check a body part tell yourself:\n      * \"The body part will be fine and nothing will happen within these 5 minutes. The timer will eventually ring.\"\n      * \"If I really need to check the body part, then I will check once the timer rings. Until then I am not moving my hands\"\n      * \"5 minutes is short. 5 minutes is short. 5 minutes is short. Nothing will happen. Nothing will happen. Nothing will happen.\"\n   * When you have the urge to check how much time is left tell yourself:\n      * \"Nope, 5 minutes is a short amount of time. The timer is counting down. I do not need to check the timer.\"\n      * \"In real life body noises and discomforts do not have a set time limit, and I need to be comfortable with not knowing when discomfort will end. It might be short, or might be long but I will not let it devour me as I ride out the discomfort\"\n\n**Reflection**\n\n* Timer has now rung and you are now free to move your hands from the surface\n\nTake 1-2 minutes to reflect on the experience. \n\n* Some things you can say when you completed the 5 minutes:\n   * \"Wow during those 5 minutes I did not check that body part and I am fine\"\n   * \"Wow 5 minutes felt really long, but I was able to go the length of the timer without checking my body\"\n   * \"Nothing bad happened during that time\"\n   * \"I marinated in the discomfort and faced it head on by not giving into it\"\n* Some things you can say if you did not meet your expectations during the session (stay positive):\n   * \"I didn't finish the 5 minutes, but I finished the time that did pass and I will be able to go longer next time\"\n   * \"During those 5 minutes I lifted up my hands, but I really tried talk myself out of trying to check my body\"\n   * \"I will get better at this exercise the more I give it a try\"\n* Take a deep breath and give yourself a pat on the shoulder for the experience you gained from that session.\n\nRepeat this exercise 3 times a day or whenever you find yourself keeping your hands on a specific body part and checking too much.\n\nGood luck!\\~",

    "title": "I’m working on it — you can too!",
    "selftext": "Hi all! I’m (25F) a well-seasoned health anxiety experiencer. It was triggered in 2019 after a traumatic experience witnessing a cancer-related deterioration and ultimately death of a close loved one. Before that any anxiety I had was purely generalized, but that experience set me on the HA path.\n\n2019 was the worst year for me by far — I started having panic attacks and it got to the point where I was agoraphobic and then spent some time in the hospital because of how awful it had gotten. It caused me to quit my job and take a semester off of college. \n\nI ended up getting “better” (took almost a year) and moving past it… all up until just over a month ago! I hit another flareup and it sucks ass!\n\nBut I’m already finding my success is coming quicker. I am a chronic “what if” thinker—what if I never recover from this? What if I’m gaslighting myself and it actually IS something this time? What if I end up in the hospital again?\n\nNope! All bullshit. I’m still fighting through it, but I’m doing okay and here’s how you can too:\n\n1. Everyone says this but stay the hell off of Google. The algorithm is designed to scare the shit out of you, and it will tell you nothing useful. If you can’t quite kick the habit, add “anxiety” to your search. If you’re anxious about an ache or pain or uncomfortable sensation, you’ll end up\nfeeling it BECAUSE of that.\n\n2. Try to logically examine why you might be experiencing aches or pains. Have you eaten today (I know it can be hard because of appetite loss but still)? Drink fluids? Bad posture? Eye strain? Sufficient sleep? Chances are you hurt because you need to take better care of yourselt.\n\n3. A CBT method of externalizing your anxiety. I make my anxious thoughts a separate existence from me. My brain trying to tell me I’m gonna have a heart attack? “Ah, that silly anxiety doing its thing again. No thanks.” And something that helped even more was externalizating the follow up “Well what if it isn’t anxiety this time?” Nope! That’s anxiety too.\n\n4. Exercising. I used to not believe this would help but it does. It teaches me my body is strong and healthy. Even yoga, meditation, deep breathing, etc. are small things that are still beneficial. \n\n5. PLEASE TRY THERAPY! I’m on week 5 of CBT and let me tell you even if the methods aren’t successful for you, just having the opportunity to talk to someone is a breath of fresh air.\n\n6. Do not overly seek out reassurance. Family members, partners, and friends reassuring you may be helpful in the moment but it’s only temporary because unless they are doctors wtf do they know about health? It’s okay to get hugs or vent, I do with my wife, but I’ve also asked her to hold me accountable for dispelling my own thoughts. \n\n7. Limit your doctors visits. I only allow\nmyself what is required of me (checkups etc). I do have a few actual ailments that require imaging, but otherwise I don’t have the money to be constantly in ER or my PCP’s office. And for many, including myself, that relief is usually only temporary too. Doctors know what they’re doing though, so if you’ve been a lot PLEASE take their word for it. \n\n8. 2 week rule: this is another good one. If I’m having a discomfort that lasts longer than two werks, THEN I consider a PCP visit. But more often than not it just goes away before then. Just recently I was having uncomfortable stomach cramps for 3-4 days (logically I think I ate bad eggs whoops), but told myself I have to wait 2 weeks before seeking care. guess what? They went away yesterday. \n\n9. PERSISTENCE! Instead of retreating to agoraphobia this time, I literally FORCED myself to continue functioning normally. I have a job and a life, and neither stop. I continued to work, went out with my wife, did things we love, played games, and kept attempting at life normally. Each passing day I proved to myself that I was not going to give into this silly experience, and it has helped me tremendously. It can be really hard to not leave a “safe space”, but trust me when I say that the more you do it, the more victorious you feel. And you can even start small.\n\n10. BE KIND TO YOURSELF AND DON’T FIGHT IT! One of my biggest weaknesses is being hard on myself because of this irrational thinking. I get mad at myself for letting these intrusive thoughts get to me, and guess what? It makes everything 1000 times worse. Being mad at myself for struggling to be present solves nothing. You have to give yourself some slack. Take self care days. Tell yourself that it’s okay to be anxious, and that you are capable of having the strength to conquer it. Fighting anxiety makes it worse—learn how to accept the discomfort and roll with it. \n\n11. Medication is okay to try if you think it’ll help. It can be a great crutch to push those REALLY struggling in the right direction, but IMO I don’t think it’s meant to be a long term solution. A lot of the work has to come from within. I have never responded well to any SSRIs/SNRIs, so I only really have myself to rely on. But having that boost is totally valid. \n\n12. This one goes out to all my fellow cardiophobes/heart-focused HAs! Firstly, hearts do not just “stop” and you aren’t going to spontaneously drop dead. Your heart is an extremely powerful organ and can withstand more than you think, especially if you’re young. Most arrhythmias (that you probably don’t have if you think you do) are not only rare but also not life-threatening. I have a double whammy being cardiophobic AND having raging POTS. It is what it is. My heart is just an over-achiever and likes to show off. Don’t we all. I’m not going to say “you’ll know for sure when something is wrong” because with panic disorder/anxiety we mfs ALWAYS think that, but pain/discomfort that comes and goes is very normal. A sick heart won’t EVER stfu and will progressively get worse. Delete the HR/EKG function on your Apple Watch, you know next to nothing about normal heart rates and rhythms even with Google and you’ll freak yourself out. Look up York Cardiology on YT—this guy was a lifesaver and explains things clearly and realistically.\n\n13. If you’re on this sub then you’re clearly aware that what you’re experiencing is HA and not a real medical concern. Let that speak for itself. \n14. Do NOT EVER give up. I know HA can feel like there’s no end in sight and that it’s insurmountable. I still struggle with that nagging feeling. But you CAN do it. The more you prove to yourself you’re capable, the easier it becomes. You will not miss out on life, and you will not become a shell of a human.\n\nI’m still getting through it and have bad days and great days, but I always tell myself I’m capable and celebrate my victories. You deserve to have yours. Sending love and strength!",

Of those thoughts: 95 percent repeat each day and on average, **80 percent of repeated thoughts are negative.**\n\nThis means that on average, only 20% of our thoughts are positive per day and they are competing for our attention with the other 80%. This 80% has megaphones but you know what, **we are not helpless**.\n\n* We can help the 20% of our positive thoughts shine brighter and dominate these negative thoughts. This is where \"marinating in the positive\" and contributing to the daily positivity thread in any way you can comes into play. **Attitude is a choice.**\n\nLet's fill this thread with some positivity from our daily lives and remind ourselves that positive things are happening while we battle the negative thoughts of health anxiety. **Some examples of things you can post include:**\n\n* Examples of positive self talk that you use for yourself (which will give others ideas that they can use for themselves regarding positive self talk).\n* Ordinary things you are grateful for (ex: your car started today or there is water to drink).\n* Small goals & victories you have accomplished.\n* Something you witnessed that made you smile, or something you did to make someone else smile.\n* Blessings, gratitude, and other positive observations in your life.\n* Accomplishments of self-care.\n* Something you created today (crafts, art, a meal...).\n* Find accountability buddies and report your self progress for some type of challenge.\n* Declaration of choosing a predominantly positive attitude in regards to HA or other aspects of life.\n* Examples of mental imagery you use for yourself to prepare for situations and/or recover from errors.\n* Declaration of acknowledgement and/or acceptance of certain things in your life (ex: emotions, health anxiety, etc).\n* Declaration of using a negative experience as a stepping stone in life to improve and get closer to your goals rather than let it interfere with your progress.\n* Declaration of living life in the \"here and now\", without regard to either the past or anticipated future events.\n* Declaration of ditching perfectionism and choosing to strive for excellence instead for something in your life (ex: \"being perfect\" vs \"being good enough\").\n\n**REGARDING \"journey updates\" standalone post**: Some of you may have been redirected here if you are providing an update on your progress via a standalone post. If you would like your standalone post to be approved, please resubmit the \"update post\" with advice in the text body (such as detailing how you got there, or what motivated you to get to where you are now, etc). This is so redditors can gain something from your post without feeling bad that they are not where you are currently at on their own journey. The reason we do this is that Reddit is another form of social media where many can fall victim to the social comparison trap. We do not want people to feel inadequate by comparing themselves to someone else's health anxiety management journey. This is why we ask redditors to include advice in their progress updates if they want it to be a standalone thread. This way people can gain information for their health anxiety management roadmaps from your post. Feel free to resubmit your post with advice added on if you want it to be a standalone post. Thank you for your cooperation.\n\nRegarding memes: Please post them here as a link and please provide a description so people know what they are clicking on.

    "selftext": "Hello! I'm a HA struggler for more than a year, still suffering, but struggling. During this year, I've had a lot of worries about different illnesses, and I overcame many of them. In this post I want to make a complete list of things that helped me and other people for each illness they were worried about. If anyone wants to participate, feel free to comment your tips for your worries below\n\nBefore I start writing, I want to clarify two things first \n\nClarification 1 - A big part of the advice I'm gonna put here is not my own, I took it from other popular posts on this sub and I'm not claiming that I wrote all of it\n\nClarification 2 - I am not a doctor. I am only sharing my experiences with anxiety and the things I've learned from it\n\n\n**Health Anxiety in General**\n\n-Health Anxiety can and will cause almost every symptom you worry about. The brain is very, very powerful and scary when it works against you\n\n-This one is basic, but if you can, don't google at all. If you really can't resist googling, when you google the symptoms, add \"anxiety\" to search. You'd be surprised\n\n-Health Anxiety can ruin every aspect of your life. If you feel like it's getting worse, go to therapy\n\n-If you're the type to go to the doctor for every little thing, do the 2 Week Rule: whatever symptom you're feeling, give it two weeks and see if it changes. If it goes away, you don't need a doctor. If it persists or gets worse, go\n\n-If you're the type to avoid doctors at all costs, apply the 2 Week Rule too. Since I'm this type, an advice I could give you is to go to a regular checkup every now and then, it can break your fears and relieve you \n\n**Heart Attack/Heart Related Illnesses**\n\n-A panic attack can easily be mistaken for a heart attack\n\n-A sick heart DOES NOT cause symptoms that come and go, or are little and short. A minor chest pain is not a sign of heart disease, an occasional shortness of breath is not a sign of heart disease. A sick heart would always hurt and cause symptoms **constantly**\n\n-Heart related anxiety is psychosomatic. If you worry about your heart a lot, you will feel chest pain. This is guaranteed and I'm speaking from my own experience. Do not be scared of this. The pains you get are due to stress and anxiety, not a heart problem\n\n-Your pulse will always vary. It depends on a million factors, including your emotions or your mood. It will go up when you're stressed, nervous, excited, anxious. It doesn't have to be fixed at 60-90\n\n-Checking your pulse constantly is a habit you must break. Best thing to do for this is to preoccupy yourself and do something that will get your mind off worrying. My advice? Gym.\n\n\n**Cancer/General**\n\n-When reading the next ones, keep in mind that CANCER IS EXTREMELY RARE. Read everything with this sentence in your mind\n\n-This one is basic, but cancer is rare. Extremely rare if you're young. If you, and you probably do, google and do research about it, eventually you will get this feeling that it's not very rare and that it's actually common because of how many information on the internet is there. This is not true. \n\n-The \"1 in 2 people get cancer\" is bullshit and heavily misinterpreted. Even if it was true, it doesn't mean you will get it now or in 2, 5, 10 years. It means you could get in your *lifetime*. That means you could probably get it when you're 60+. And honestly if you ask me, I wouldn't worry about that at 20 or 30\n\n-Not every little thing you don't know what it is is cancer\n\n-Unless you're in unbearable pain or have obvious, bad symptoms that aren't \"this hurts\" or \"this feels weird\", you don't have cancer\n\n-Cancer can't be traced by one symptom. You would have to have some pretty unique and bad ones for it to be cancer. For example, just a headache is never a symptom of brain tumor. But a headache, followed by seizures, movement problems, vision loss, etc. is. \n\n\n**Skin Cancer**\n\n-There are about a hundred skin conditions you could mistake for skin cancer, do not jump into conclusions\n\n-A sunburn does not mean you will get skin cancer, but still try to avoid it, especially if you have a sensitive skin\n\n-Melanoma is very obvious. It doesn't look like your regular mole and you can't really mistake it for one. The mole you're worried about is not melanoma\n\n-Moles grow. If you're under 30, you should know this. It's not abnormal for moles to grow, especially if you're a teenager\n\n-Every normal mole can itch. An itching mole is not an emergency, nor a symptom of cancer\n\n-If you scratch off a mole, nothing will happen and you won't get melanoma. Still try not to do it \n\n\n**Testicular Cancer**\n\n-It is normal for one testicle to be bigger and lower than the other\n\n-If you feel a sharp pain that just goes away and you never feel it again in the near future, it is not cancer. I'm pretty sure it happens to everyone at least once\n\n-If you do the exam and feel \"something\", especially at the back of the testicle, that's not a lump, that's the epididymis, a part of the testicle people always seem to confuse for a lump\n\n-If you obsessively check for lumps, preoccupy yourself by doing something with your hands. Trust me, a lump will not spawn if you stop checking for it\n\n-If you do happen to find a lump, it doesn't have to mean it's cancer. It could be a cyst or hernia. I would advise googling only when you're actually sure you've found a lump, and then see a doctor afterwards\n\n\n**Stomach Cancers**\n\n-Stomach pain is not a standalone symptom of cancer. If you really did have it, you'd have a variety of other symptoms\n\n-Blood in poop can be caused by hemorrhoids too\n\n-Typically, blood in poop would mean your entire toilet water being red. If you see pieces of \"blood\" in your poop, it's not blood, it's from food \n\n-Those pieces in the poop vary according to what you were eating. For example, if you ate spinach, you could have pieces of green there. If you ate something spicy with chili, you could have red bits, which you could confuse for blood\n\n-Your poop color always varies according to what you were eating. The most common thing is when you notice blackish poop after eating blueberries. The amount of times I traced this to cancer is uncountable, until I learned how food impacts your poop\n\n-If you have frequent diarrhea or loose, yellow poop, that's due to stress \n\n-Anxiety messes with your bowel movements a lot. And I really mean A LOT. When I was worrying about colon cancer, I used to go to the toilet for about 4-5 times a day. When I stopped worrying about it, it was once a day",

I cpuld worry about cancer, and die on my way down the stairs. But does worrying about every single possible thing, prevent anything? It doesnt. So I am practicing taking a \"Ill cross that bridge when I get there\" attitude. If I get sick, I will deal with it. Theres people who survived the unimaginable, healthcare advances everyday, theres people who have dealt with things before healthcare existed, theres people way older or unhealthier than me who are coping well and doing okay. Life isnt perfect, we can live on edge waiting for the other shoe to drop. The truth is ANYTHING could possibly happen so its way better to live in the present moment and cherish it than to just sit down overthink, worry and waste time. \n\nAnother thing I do is I remember a lot of things that happened to me before and remember that I did get through it. \n\nLastly, my main fear is going insane or hearing/seeing things one day. But when I faced the facts I learned 1, theres medications for this and 2, if you truly do go insane you wont even be aware of it so you basically wont suffer. Instead of worrying constantly it helps to read about all the advancements being made in medicine. We are extremely lucky to be living in these times health wise. Theres help and coping methods for pretty much anything out there.",

This is so redditors can gain something from your post without feeling bad that they are not where you are currently at on their own journey. The reason we do this is that Reddit is another form of social media where many can fall victim to the social comparison trap. We do not want people to feel inadequate by comparing themselves to someone else's health anxiety management journey. This is why we ask redditors to include advice in their progress updates if they want it to be a standalone thread. This way people can gain information for their health anxiety management roadmaps from your post. Feel free to resubmit your post with advice added on if you want it to be a standalone post.

    "selftext": "In 2020 I developed intense health anxiety and was constantly terrified of developing terminal illnesses and/or getting severely ill. I was honestly trapped in a cycle that would often leave me unable to move aside from shivering. \n\nI also had intense anxieties surrounding eating as I was scared of contracting food borne illnesses. This left me too afraid to eat chicken or eat with my fingers. A side effect of this was I compulsively sanitised and washed my hands constantly.\n\nAt the start of the year 2022 I decided to get a gym membership. I was very underweight and I wanted to be more healthy and I saw it as a good place to start. \n\nI eventually recognised that if I wanted to be more active I’d have to incorporate more protein into my diet and the most effective way of doing that was to eat meat.\n\nSo I went to the local supermarket and I bought a chicken triple which is essentially 3 sandwiches of precooked chicken and I bought a chicken fillet on the side. \n\nI then sat down and forced myself to eat all 3 sandwiches and the fillet. The next day I was fine. I was terrified in the moment but suddenly I realised how good it felt to fight the things that made me feel so scared.\n\nWhen it came to my fear of diseases I kept my health anxiety in check by only allowing myself to worry if the signs I was worried about were still there after a week or two. \nThis gave me a lot of peace of mind knowing that as long as I kept my eye on the things worrying me I could live a more happy life. \n\nI started to test all the little things that made me intensely anxious. I ate crisps with my fingers in front of my family to show that I’d come a long way. I’d go out of my way to buy chicken items from places like subway just to try it. I applied this mentality to every thing that had ever made me anxious and it worked there was progress.\n\n2 years and 4 months after I first found that I suffer health anxiety I can confirm that the majority of the things that used to bother me simply no longer do. \n\nIt’s daunting facing the things that terrify you it’s easy to slip back into old habits. But there is always hope. My way of dealing with it may not work for you and that is absolutely fine. The point of me saying all this is to show that you are not alone. If I can overcome it so can you. You are amazing.\n\n\nThank you for reading and best of luck.",

    "selftext": "The information on the internet is accurate. Headaches ARE a symptom of brain cancer. A nagging cough can be a sign of lung cancer. A rash could be related to lupus. But all of those things can also be signs of many other less serious conditions, and in many cases nothing at all! We tend to blame Google and avoid googling our symptoms while it is our interpretation of the data provided by google that is the problem.\nI think we need to take a step back and really think about what the problem with our line of reasoning is. It could be different for each person. I've noticed that if a symptom is only 5% likely to be caused by a serious condition and 95% likely to be caused by a benign condition, my brain tends to focus on the 5% likelihood of serious illness simply because it represents 100% of the fatality that could be related to said symptom. I think it's just how our brains work. We focus on what is dangerous, and not what is benign, and that thwarts our reasoning abilities to the point that we freak out and trigger a fight or flight response. It's part of the reason why other people can dismiss our fears of disease easier. They're not smarter or more rational. They're just not burdened by fear because it's not their life that is in danger. I've had friends who dismissed my fears of a symptom who then went on to be 10 times as anxious as I was when it was their own health that they were worried about.\nUnderstanding our own thought process and knowing the flaws in our reasoning is the only way we can fight back against health anxiety! \n\nTL;DR Google represents knowledge and knowledge is always good!

Of those thoughts: 95 percent repeat each day and on average, **80 percent of repeated thoughts are negative.**\n\nThis means that on average, only 20% of our thoughts are positive per day and they are competing for our attention with the other 80%. This 80% has megaphones but you know what, **we are not helpless**.\n\n* We can help the 20% of our positive thoughts shine brighter and dominate these negative thoughts. This is where \"marinating in the positive\" and contributing to the daily positivity thread in any way you can comes into play. **Attitude is a choice.**\n\nLet's fill this thread with some positivity from our daily lives and remind ourselves that positive things are happening while we battle the negative thoughts of health anxiety. **Some examples of things you can post include:**\n\n* Examples of positive self talk that you use for yourself (which will give others ideas that they can use for themselves regarding positive self talk).\n* Ordinary things you are grateful for (ex: your car started today or there is water to drink).\n* Small goals & victories you have accomplished.\n* Something you witnessed that made you smile, or something you did to make someone else smile.\n* Blessings, gratitude, and other positive observations in your life.\n* Accomplishments of self-care.\n* Something you created today (crafts, art, a meal...).\n* Find accountability buddies and report your self progress for some type of challenge.\n* Declaration of choosing a predominantly positive attitude in regards to HA or other aspects of life.\n* Examples of mental imagery you use for yourself to prepare for situations and/or recover from errors.\n* Declaration of acknowledgement and/or acceptance of certain things in your life (ex: emotions, health anxiety, etc).\n* Declaration of using a negative experience as a stepping stone in life to improve and get closer to your goals rather than let it interfere with your progress.\n* Declaration of living life in the \"here and now\", without regard to either the past or anticipated future events.\n* Declaration of ditching perfectionism and choosing to strive for excellence instead for something in your life (ex: \"being perfect\" vs \"being good enough\").\n\n**REGARDING \"journey updates\" standalone post**: Some of you may have been redirected here if you are providing an update on your progress via a standalone post. If you would like your standalone post to be approved, please resubmit the \"update post\" with advice in the text body (such as detailing how you got there, or what motivated you to get to where you are now, etc). This is so redditors can gain something from your post without feeling bad that they are not where you are currently at on their own journey. The reason we do this is that Reddit is another form of social media where many can fall victim to the social comparison trap. We do not want people to feel inadequate by comparing themselves to someone else's health anxiety management journey. This is why we ask redditors to include advice in their progress updates if they want it to be a standalone thread. This way people can gain information for their health anxiety management roadmaps from your post. Feel free to resubmit your post with advice added on if you want it to be a standalone post. Thank you for your cooperation.",

    "title": "I’ve been having panic attacks everyday for 2 years. Here’s what I’ve learned.",
    "selftext": "For the past two or so years I’ve been convinced I’m dying of a certain disease. Colon cancer, leukemia, heart disease, you name it. It’s been bad, and I’m trying very hard to fix myself, but its hard to convince yourself you’re fine when you feel these symptoms. Anyways, heres a couple things I’ve learned and hope I can one day use to help myself.\n\n1.) Your symptoms can almost always be traced back to your lifestyle - I realized this today actually. Not getting enough sleep, eating unhealthy, or just isolating yourself & getting in your own mind can lead to worse panic attacks. Recently I’ve found myself staying up way too late, and its led to stronger symptoms.\n\n2.) You can talk yourself out of a panic attack - This one came as a tbit of a surprise because a telltale sign of a panic attack is the overload worrying thoughts flooding your brain, but if you convince yourself you’re okay and not dying, the panic attack will subside much faster\n\n3.) You will not pass out - Your heart beating fast means you’re pumping blood throughout your body, including your head. If you feel like you’re going to pass out, feel your heart rate. If it’s beating fast, you aren’t going to pass out. It is possible to pass out from a panic attack, but it’s very unlikely and not fatal. If you need to take a seat then do it, but know its unlikely you’re going to pass\n\n4.) Stress and Anxiety can make you feel lethargic for the day - Sometimes when I have panic attacks, or I have a particularly stressful day, I feel extremely lethargic & out of breath for days afterwards. I know a sign of cancer is getting winded quickly, but if this isnt a constant symptom (everyday for weeks) then it’s probably anxiety\n\n5.) Unless you’re losing weight rapidly or in terrible pain, it’s likely you don’t have cancer - Self explanatory. Getting screened won’t hurt,  but it’s not something to worry about usually\n\n6.) “What you eat now won’t affect your heart for 30 years, its incredibly unlikely you’re having a heart attack unless you’ve been smoking crack every day for 5 years” - This was told to me by a paramedic during my first panic attack\n\n7.) Its okay to be honest with your friends and family - I know for me personally, I was super self conscious of my breathing and tried to hide my anxiety from my family. If anything, it made it worse. Theres no shame in excusing yourself from a room or telling your people that you’re currently having a panic attack. They’ll understand.\n\nI should say- I’m not a doctor. But you really should trust yours. The reason why you hear about “Doctors getting it wrong” in the news so often is because it happens so rarely that journalists deem it newsworthy. If they made an article for everytime a doctor was right, it’d overload the news. Take a breath, relax, chances are you’re perfectly fine. If you must get a screening, do so, but try your best to trust the results. If you’re young, chances are you don’t have heart problems. Unless you’ve smoked crack 5 times a day for 7 years\n\nEDIT: Sorry, I typed this a little late a night last night so it came out a little funky. I’ve been through it all, if you have any questions or concerns, or just need some reassurance, feel free to PM me",

    "selftext": "I found out about many reasons that we could get a headache you maybe might not have heard about, it really helped me about my anxiety so maybe it'll help you as well.\n  A small, important muscle strain can cause headache on one side of your head,usually dull and comes and goes, also can cause pressure as well. Muscle strains are extremely common and we might not even feel it because we're on our phones or on our laptops looking at them with poor posture for so long.So before you freak out about a one in a million thing, check your neck for stiffness. If it feels hard, that's probably causing your headache. Looking at your phone too much or with too bright light can cause headaches too. Dry eyes, eye strain( which is just your eyes getting tired, nothing a few hours of resting can't fix). Not wearing sunglasses in the sun,(especially if you have sensitive eyes). Also those long nights of googling sicknesses that you %99.9 do not have that leads you to stay up all night? That is prob causing your -not brain tumour- headache too. Because believe it or not, sleeping during the night rather than the morning is quite important. \nYour brain is in a constant fight or flight mode when HA flares up. That leads to tensed muscles, tensed muscles lead to tension headaches and even migraines. So yeah before thinking about the small VERY EXTREMELY SMALL chance of a brain tumour, think of all these. And trust me, brain tumours are never just a mild headache you get during evenings. \nJust rest your eyes and listen to some nature sounds, that might help with that headache",

    "title": "Which of the 9 common thinking patterns associated with health anxiety is driving your health anxiety, and what techniques have you implemented to take back the driver's seat from the thinking pattern?",
    "selftext": "The 9 common thinking patterns associated with health anxiety are:\n\n1. **All-or-Nothing Thinking**: You look at things in absolute, black-and-white categories, rather than seeing the middle ground. There is no in-between. Any body sensation becomes a sign of a serious health problem. For example, you are either completely healthy or seriously ill, and if you do not get to the doctor at the first sign of trouble, it will be too late. Another example is, “Detailed tests are the only way to rule out an illness.”\n2. **Fortune-Telling**: You make gloom and doom predictions about things that haven’t happened yet, as if you are a fortune teller. For example, “I’m sure I’ll find a l>!ump!< if I check myself”, “If I go to the doctor, he/she’ll tell me I’m very sick”, or “My father died at this age, so I will too.”\n3. **Negative Interpretations**: You jump to conclusions and interpret unexplained body sensations as a sign of a serious illness or other medical problem. Anything that seems to feel “not quite right” becomes a serious disease. For example, “This is not a headache, it’s a b>!rain tumor!<” or “The pain in my stomach is a serious illness that no doctors can figure out.”\n4. **Intolerance of Uncertainty**: You do not feel satisfied unless you have a complete and agreeable (to you) explanation for the cause and nature of your mysterious body sensations and symptoms. Anything less than a full medical explanation is unacceptable.\n5. **Assumptions About Probability**: You take it for granted and overestimate the likelihood of catastrophic outcomes – you assume that a generally unlikely event is much more likely to occur than it really is. For example, the idea that serious illnesses and diseases are very easy to catch and lurking everywhere; that you are more vulnerable than others to a certain illness (perhaps because of family history); or the assumption that because you didn’t mention something to the doctor, he or she overlooked the presence of a serious health problem.\n6. **Assumptions About Severity**: You overestimate the “awfulness” of feared outcomes and automatically assume that negative events, such as having an illness or dying, would be 101% terrible and certainly more horrific or awful than you could cope with. For example, “I must look after my health at all times, or I will be a terrible burden on my family,” and “Death will be lonely and painful (accompanied by images >!of oneself being self-aware, buried, and eaten by worms!<).”\n7. **Disqualifying**: You focus only on certain information or facts (usually information that supports your view) but ignore or explain away other facts that are just as relevant (but that do not support your view).\n8. **Lofty Standards**: You hold extremely high expectations of others – namely medical professionals – to be able to understand your body symptoms and give you a definitive explanation or cause for everything you think might be wrong with you. This leads to doctor-shopping and continuing to seek out “the best” doctors to explain the unexplainable, or prevent a serious disease.\n9. **Intolerance of Anxiety**: You feel that anxiety or discomfort will persist forever unless you do something to escape. Sometimes the fear is that the anxiety or emotional discomfort will spiral out of control or lead to “going crazy,” “losing control,” or other harmful medical or physical consequences.\n\n^(Abramowitz 2010)",

    "selftext": "Maintenance factors are usually the answer to the following three questions:\n\n* If clinical health anxiety develops from mistaken beliefs and misinterpretations of non-dangerous body sensations, why does it persist?\n* Why don’t people with this problem listen to their doctors, correct their flawed beliefs, and change their maladaptive behavior?\n* Why do people with clinical health anxiety fail to recognize that their fears and behaviors are inconsistent with the reassuring feedback they receive from medical professionals?\n\nThe above 3 questions boil down to \"If we know this information then why is health so hard to self correct/manage?\", and it is usually due to maintenance factor getting in the way. Here are the 7 common maintenance factors associated with health anxiety:\n\n1. **Flight-Fight Response (Physiological)**: Harmless, anxiety-related bodily sensations seem like true medical problems, reaffirming the belief that one is ill.\n2. **Selective attention to Threat** **(Cognitive)**: Hyper-vigilance to normal “body noise” and other slight body sensations seems to confirm the presence of a feared illness.\n3. **Confirmation bias (Cognitive)**: Tendency to seek evidence that validates one’s fear and discount information that invalidates the fear.\n4. **Memory bias (Cognitive)**: Tendency to inflate remembered estimates of the likelihood of illness.\n5. **Safety behaviors and signals (Behavioral)** : Behaviors, stimuli, and situations associated with safety, which reduce anxiety in the short-term, but paradoxically prevent disconfirmation of illness fears.\n6. **Checking and reassurance-seeking (Behavioral)**: Excessive attempts to gain certainty of health status often lead to obtaining alarming information. Body checking may produce apparent “symptoms” of a feared disease.\n7. **Avoidance (Behavioral)**: Prevents disconfirmation of dysfunctional health beliefs.\n\n^(Abramowitz 2010)",

    "selftext": "My Anxiety journey began September last year following a panic attack, anxiety soon followed which eventually developed into Health Anxiety because of the overwhelming weird physical symptoms. \n\nMy life became miserable, i developed agoraphobia i couldn’t leave the house, i was having panic attacks and feeling the weirdest physical symptoms, my days would consist of me lying on the floor of my room, completely frantic & uncomfortable glued to my phone on various subreddits searching for symptoms, making posts on various subreddits, reassurance seeking, if you check my old posts you can see the turmoil i was in at the time, my life had reached rockbottom, i couldn’t leave the house, i felt awful at home, i was trapped, that was until i found 2 youtube channels ‘The Anxiety Guy’ and ‘The Anxiety Project’ these channels educated me on what i was actually dealing with and gave me the tools on how to deal with it.  \n\nThese are the things what saved me, i wouldn’t be where i am now if i didn’t stick to these things:\n\nMeditation: I was introduced to the concept of meditation through the videos i was watching and I remember my ego was so high at the time, i didn’t see how it could possibly help me, but i tried it and i was amazed how peaceful i felt after it, i introduced it into my morning and night time routine 15 minutes each time, and it just gave me an outlet to relax. Morning meditation allowed me to put on my armour to take on the day, when before i would just wake up frantic and try take on the day naked, Night time meditation allowed me to leave any stresses i had during the day at the door, allowing me to have a relaxing night to restore my tired mind & body. Your probably reading this thinking ‘I ain’t no Buddhist monk, this is never gonna work!’ thats exactly how i felt at first haha, but just give it a try you may not feel the benefits at first but stick with it, believe me you feel the benefits eventually. Also if you have trauma associated with anxiety Reframing these traumas is amazing.\n\nBreathing exercises: With anxiety you will find yourself shallow breathing quite a lot, shallow breathing ain’t good as it increases the amount of Co2 in your body which in turn causes a lot of physical symptoms like tightness & dizziness, this is where breathing exercises come into play, the one what helped me the most is called belly breathing, breathing through the nose, holding and then letting go, breath work like this helps to activate the parasympathetic nervous system what in turn calms you down. (Search on YouTube for a great guide ‘The Anxiety Guy Breathing Exercises’) \n\nExercise: When your in the thick of Health Anxiety you feel so unhealthy and awful, this is why its important to take up habits that promote good bodily health, as it gives you that evidence to support the fact you are healthy, its also a great way to get yourself out the house and off your devices, i took up Cycling and weights, cycling is absolute bliss and is great for all aspects of the body. I know its very easy to see Health Anxiety as a bad thing but without it i would have never took up any of these healthy habits, i am a healthier person now then i was before. \n\nYoga: Again another habit that promotes excellent bodily health, and helps in all aspects of the body, its also extremely relaxing. Yoga just helps to release that built up tension and stress. I practice it morning and night alongside meditation. Theres some great Yoga videos on youtube if you search ‘Yoga for Anxiety’ you will find loads.\n\nHope some of these tips help, overall it just important to keep yourself busy as unfortunately lying in bed doom-scrolling isn’t gonna help anything, its just gonna make matters worse. I recommend cutting out bad habits like reassurance seeking, if this sub still has the daily venting thing please run a marathon away from that as it does not help in the long term, I understand why its there but i found i would always find more things to worry about by spending time there when my HA was at its worse. \n\nKeep in mind, you aren’t gonna be healed overnight, it took me months, i still feel my symptoms every now and then, but im so much better at dealing with it now, again keep in mind recovery is 1000% possible i was at complete rockbottom bedridden all those months ago, now in a weeks time im going back to University to start up ‘The Anxiety Society’ to hopefully help some people out, you will get there.",

Hope this makes some kinda sense",

    "title": "Overcoming Health Anxiety",
    "selftext": "Every once in a while I'm reminded of the struggle I went through for so many years with health anxiety. I came here to check up on this thread that I would frequent so often and see so many of you struggling. So today I came here to share a few things that may provide some relief/give some guidance to navigate through tough times when dealing with health anxiety. I hope what I write doesn't come off too harsh because that isn't my intention. Sometimes, putting things bluntly is the only way to get the point across.\n\n**1** \\- If you are a compulsive Googler **stop.** Point blank. I'm sure you've been told this before at some point, and I can understand and empathize why you still do it if you do. But really, try your best to stop Googling your symptoms. I know it may feel like Googling helps but more often than not, you're going to come across a condition or illness that shares a few of the symptoms you're experiencing and end up in a panic attack. \n\n**2** \\- (If applicable) Try your best to stop asking people for reassurance. Back at my lowest points, I was asking family members, friends, my partner constantly if I was having a heart attack, stroke, had some deadly illness, etc. They are not doctors, and while it may feel good to be told that you are okay, it doesn't help you. It only provides temporary relief until the next thought pops up and you are anxious again. \n\n**3 -**  I know some health anxiety suffers will constantly visit their doctors/go to emergency rooms to check if they are okay and healthy. I was not one of these people. In fact, I was the complete opposite, I was terrified of seeing a doctor and somehow discovering I had some incurable illness. If you can relate to this, I actually do recommend seeing a doctor once. In hindsight, seeing a doctor and hearing that I was perfectly healthy would of likely benefited me. Please keep in mind that when I say this I don't mean go see a doctor to get a checkup and continuously or obsessively see a doctor to continue to make sure you are in good health. Seeing a doctor once for a routine check up should be enough. \n\n**4 -**  (and probably the most important) - Stop \"checking\". This is a bit more complicated to explain, so bare with me. I was a compulsive checker, and at first I didn't even notice I was doing it. There would be points where I was feeling okay, not anxious, not thinking about symptoms, etc., and I would \"check\" on how I was feeling. It was almost as if I noticed that I was feeling okay, and as soon as I did the symptoms/anxiety/panic would come right back. Periodically throughout the day while I was distracted or doing a task I would do this checking and the symptoms would come right back. Like I said, I know it may be difficult to understand but hopefully I shed some type of light on this. \n\n*While all of these tips may seem simple and even easy, I do understand how hard it can be to stop doing these things. It took me a lot of analyzing and work to stop doing these things and really start healing my health anxiety, and I can say for certain that I have recovered almost fully from health anxiety. I wont lie, there are times where I get panicky and anxious about certain things, but no where close to where I was in the midst of my health anxiety. Even when I do get panicky and anxious, I can easily brush it off and will only remain anxious for a few hours at the most.* \n\nIf you have any questions or need more explanation on something I mentioned, feel free to ask. I could go on more with tips but I don't want to overload people in just one post. I struggled with this for many many years and have experienced many different aspects of health anxiety. I know it may feel so heavy at times and like it will never end, but please just remember that you don't have to suffer forever with this. Like I said, it will take time and work but you can over come this. <3\n\nQuick edit here. Obviously I’m not a doctor or professional and with that, I don’t have all the answers and none of my advice is meant to replace medical/mental health treatment. I’m only sharing this information and tips because I remember how scary and overwhelming it is to be dealing with health anxiety on a daily basis. I’m more than happy to provide tips that helped me.",

Just as a disclaimer, this is NOT health advice and should not be done in lieu of seeing a real doctor and using real prescription medication. This is just a silly tactic that my brain responds to. \n\nSo I took the label off an empty prescription bottle I have and filled the bottle with Tic-Tac candies. When I feel weird or anxious, and I know it's anxiety related and not a real medical issue, I take one or two candies like I would real medicine but I tell myself \"these will help my anxiety\" or whatever I need to hear. It's just placebo, and my brain knows that, but it also somehow works (I'd say it's more like a 50/50 shot it will have any effect). I can eat as many as I need and I don't have to worry about ill effects if I have 5 versus 2. The point of using the empty prescription bottle is to further help trick my brain into thinking the candies are actually useful. It's helped me at night when my anxiety is the worst and I need to sleep. \n\nAgain, this is not medical advice and I'm not saying to do this instead of taking the real medications prescribed to you by a doctor. Please take your medicine if you are prescribed medicine. This is just a placebo that I found helps me throughout the week, and I thought I'd share it.",

What I realised after one of my panic attacks today is that if I was mentally ok and didn’t have hypochondria, I probably wouldn’t even care about the nosebleed. This sounds really logical, but once you realise that fear due to health anxiety is irrational, things get easier. I talked to at least 8 people today and told them I think I have leukaemia because of one nosebleed, and all of them told me I was overreacting. So what I am trying to do now is trust in the healthy minds of other people, rather then my own. Since that my own mind is not healthy. \nOnce you develop serious health anxiety, your ability to sense fear and danger from sickness is not functioning well, so you shouldn’t trust it.

This is not really backed up by science, just some ways that I found to make my panic attacks less shitty :)\n\n- When you feel a panic attack coming, immediately stop to examine your thoughts. I always thought that my panic attacks came randomly, but 99% of the time I was thinking scary thoughts. Try to reframe your thoughts if you can and do something else.\n\n- When you already have a panic attack, try to do something else as well. In the beginning I was always sitting and staring straight in front of me, trying to \"control\" the panic attack. This will only cause it to be worse. Try to take your mind completely of it and just let it happen to you. Remember that you are safe. Some of my favourite things to do is reading a book and saying the words out loud, and I LOVE the app Finch on my phone. This is an app which has helped me a lot, you grow a cute bird and it helps with first aid anxiety with some good grounding techniques. \n\n- Don't \"stare\" into space. Try to keep your eyes centered and move your head if you want to look at other things. Try to look around and not in one place, this will help with keeping out of your head and derealisation.\n\n- With nocturnal panic attacks, try to wake up immediately and go out of bed or at least sit up straight. This is very annoying when it happens, but this is the fastest way to getting alright again. When you don't wake up immediately you might get stuck between dreaming and having a panic attack, which causes things to get a lot worse.\n\n- I have found that some products increase my anxiety a lot, like caffeine and sugar. Almost always when I drink a coke for example, I feel a very small panic attack already coming up. I still drink and eat all these products because I don't believe you should avoid anything in anxiety, but if you are going away and you are already a little nervous, it is best to try and eat healthy\n\n- On the same page, try to sleep 8 hours a night and keep your phone away from your bed. Try to create a nighttime routine 30 min before bed to get sleepy. Almost always when I am thinking a lot of just watched something scary right before bed, I am almost guaranteed to get a nocturnal panic attack. The brain still processes information in your sleep. I like to read a book before bed and already dim the light so my body can get a little sleepy naturally. This reduces my chance on a panic attack greatly. Try not to think to much before bed (I know, easier said then done).\n\n- I get out of breath a lot, and the best thing I found to do was to keep one nostril closed and breath calmly through one nostril. You will panic and want to try to breath through your mouth, but really try not to. Keep yourself busy during.\n\n- If I really cannot get out of my head at all and nothing works, I play online chess on my telephone. This gets me into my head even more but because you have to think about moves, you have less time to think about something scary. This tip however only works if you love chess haha. If you don't, maybe try something else where you have to think a lot.\n\n- When you are in public and you feel a panic attack coming, try to get a quick moment for yourself immediately. Most of the time, you can always get to the bathroom or in a fitting room or anything. I get a lot of panic attacks on the train, and a lot of my panic comes from that I don't want other people to see me struggle. When things get overwhelming, try to get a little break where nobody can see you to regroup. (P.S. If you think everybody is staring at you, they are really not! I once threw up all over myself in the train and was sooo embarrassed, but nobody even noticed. I managed to clean myself up without people looking my way. My anxiety was immediately gone after that.)\n\n- Even in the worst scenario if you faint (which you almost never do), you will be okay. You will continue breathing and I assure you you will be fine. However, if you are afraid of fainting, try to sit down. Push your shoulders far back and have good posture, this allows better breathing. \n\n- Because of my fear of fainting, I feel better sitting down during a panic attack. However, sometimes my body also feels very worked up and then walking around in a normal tempo also helps me get my breathing under control. This also sometimes makes me dizzy, so do what feels right in this.\n\nI hope this helps anybody! Everybody is different ofcourse, but I hope someone could get a good tip out of this :)",

    "selftext": "So I've definitely been there, being awake at 4am googling sleep apnea symptoms, or if a heart attack can kill you in your sleep, and setting alarms every 2 hours to make sure I was still alive.\nFor months I never \"fell asleep\" in the traditional sense but more so just passed out from exhaustion in bed after hours of worrying about the chance of me dying.\nI had 2 major things that helped me with this\n\nFirst of all, getting into a mindset that sleep is a time for healing, it's how our bodies repair themselves after a day of using energy. You risk much more health issues by staying awake. And virtually all things that could kill you in your sleep have warning signs very far in advance. If you had life threatening sleep apnea you would not be able to function during the day, you would be falling asleep constantly during the day and people would notice.\n\nSecond and more importantly, getting in the habit of falling asleep without worry. Force yourself to get in bed and lie down without your phone, without the tv, with nothing to distract you. Force yourself to sit through the discomfort, it will be difficult and you'll be afraid, but you'll wake up in the morning and prove to yourself nothing was wrong. Now do the same thing the next night, the more you can do this and start associating sleep as a means for healing and rest as opposed to something to be afraid of, the easier it will get and the quality of your sleep will vastly improve :)",

    "selftext": "I haven't used reddit in months, finally decided to log back in and give an update and share some positivity on this thread. I want to give back a little bit to a community that genuinely helped me.\n\nI really thought I was never ever going to get better. I was at the point of having 10+ panic attacks a day, insomnia from hell, 24/7 chest pain, dizziness, upper back pain, chronic headaches. You name it. I called the psychiatric hospital and begged to be admitted, I lost all of my friends, I went to 3 different therapists. I saw doctors, I went to the ER. I called 911. I couldn't drive, I was so agoraphobic I couldn't leave my house. Any time a commercial for medicine came on the TV I had a panic attack. I was so severely sucked into health anxiety that I destroyed my life for 2 years. I quit my job, I dropped out of school. I'm telling you I lost EVERYTHING.\n\nI want to give back. I know what it feels like to lose everything. To feel like a freak, to be so isolated because you can't go anywhere. I want to help. Here is how I recovered:\n\n1. I went to the ER. My health anxiety centered around my HEART. I also had severe anxieties about breast cancer and colon cancer in particular. One day I was at the store because literally I ran out of food, I had to force myself to go. It was the the biggest panic attack I had ever had. I ran out of the store without paying (left all my groceries) and ran to my car. I genuinely thought I was going to die in the parking lot. I called 911, I went to the ER. You MUST go to the doctor initially to confirm that it's anxiety. You deserve healthcare and you deserve reassurance. Once the doctor reassured me it wasn't a heart attack, I went to my PcP and I did a full panel of bloodwork. I had her do a repeat EKG. \n\n2. I went to a specialist. Even though I was reassured by my PCP I still went to a cardiologist. This was the best thing I ever did. All he does all day is look at hearts. He examined me, told me I have a normal variant of an EKG (I have some sort of normal heart rythmn that sometimes they see in young people who are athletes). It's not dangerous, it isnt possible for it to cause chest pain. It's just the way my heart functions. It's normal. He told me I have no murmur. He cleared me for all activites and told me I didn't need to come back. So at that point I had a slew of ER doctors, my PCP and a cardiologist tell me my heart was fine. Then I went to a breast specialist. She did an exam, told me she felt nothing and sent me on my way with a clean PAP smear and a negative HPV test. I wont need to see her again for three years.\n\n3. I developed a stringent routine that I did not under any circumstances deviate from. You will need to decide what is best for you here. You must develop a routine if you want to get away from anxiety. I meditated, I read books. I deleted my social medial accounts (including this one). You may think it's a severe response but the anxiety was worse.\n\n4. I forced myself to go out. I literally forced myself. Even if that meant crying in the bathroom wherever I went. Even if that meant sweating it out, feeling like I was on the verge og passing out I was so uncomfortable, and I wanted to run away so badly. You HAVE to force yourself. You have to confront that.\n\n5. I got on medication. Taking medication is not for everyone but it is a VIABLE option. Don't ever let anyone make you feel like taking medicine for anxiety is shameful. It's not. Speak to a doctor to see if medication might be right for you. It saved my life. \n\n6. I picked up hobbies. I bought a bike, I got a new kitten, I created to do lists and I stuck to them. I cleaned my house. Clean that house, I know you're fighting every day to survive but clean that house it will help you I promise.\n\nHere are some tools I used:\n- Cold Showers\n- Epsom salt baths (helps with muscle pain)\n- No caffine. I completely cut out caffine.\n- Caffine free herbal teas nightly\n- 5mg of Meletonin sometimes 10mg if it was a rough day\n- A water fountain in my room\n- I stopped consuming negative content on social media\n- I bought an app that blocked certain websites from my phone and computers so I couldn't google my symptoms (blocksite, very affordable)\n- Lavender zum mist in my bed at night \n- I stretched nightly before bed\n- I ate only fruits and vegetables (not required but going vegan helped me, again not required).\n- I got at least 30 minutes of cardiovascular exercise 4 days out of the week.\n- I deleted the HR function off of my watch.\n- I used noise canceling headphones when I felt overstimulated \n- I moved to a different city (not required, I needed to escape the area I was in because it was so negative. I lived in the south and i'm gay, you can draw your own conclusions there).\n- I stopped speaking to people that were bad influences (drinking all the time, smoking all the time). People who made me feel pressured to engage in that stuff.\n- I reduced my alcohol consumption to zero. I do have some occasional beer now but it took me awhile to get to that point.\n- Vitamin B-12 supplement \n- Skincare routine, personal hygiene routines that improved the way I felt about myself which in turn improved my mood.\n\n*Disclaimer: I am fully aware that some of these things require money in order to do them. I am extremely privileged and understand that these services are NOT available to everyone. If you can't afford therapy, or don't have health insurance a lot of communities offer these services for free. You are not alone, you matter. Please send me a message if this describes you and I can help research some services in your area. I am happy to do that and I am happy to help in any way. I was so lost, I want to give back as much as possible. It is inconceivable that in this country the only thing standing in between someone and recovery is money. Unacceptable, you aren't alone. You matter.*",

    "selftext": "Hi,\n\nSo a bit over 2 weeks ago I ended up with rabies as the new focus of my anxiety. These days I'm... _mostly_ over it, in that I both cognitively realize that things I was worried about as possible \"exposures\" really make no sense to be worried about and I can actually mostly avoid thinking about it (though it tends to get worse late in the day).\n\nBuuut. While I was still more anxious about this, like a few days after my anxiety started, I had a dream. Within the dream, I remembered using some sort of \"home rabies test\" and it coming up positive.\n\nAnd, like... logically, I know it was a dream. In large part (but not only) because I know a test like that doesn't exist - I even asked on r/AskDocs about it and they told me that, no, there's no such thing. (Of course, they said that it's very hard to get a _reliable_ diagnosis without postmortem analysis, which makes me worry about \"well what about less reliable ones\"... but yeah, a home rabies test isn't a thing that exists.)\n\nBut _if_ it were somehow real, if I were somehow misremembering and it actually happened, it would overturn all the evidence against me having been exposed to rabies and mean that I _had_ actually been exposed. And because of that, my mind refuses to fully let go of it. Whenever I think about rabies again for a moment, my initial thought tends to be something along the lines of \"well, good thing I'm not that anxious about that anymore\"... but then that dream comes to mind again. And all of a sudden there's a small part of me that's worried again. I've learned to shut that part out for the most part... and yet it's hard for me to fully convince myself that it's _right_ to shut that part out.\n\nSo... has something like this (something happening in a dream that would justify your anxiety) happened to you, or have you heard of it happening? And how do you deal with this?\n\n(As a sidenote, I think part of the reason it's so difficult to let go of is that it's not so much that I used that \"rabies test\" within the dream, but rather that I _started_ the dream with a memory of having already used it... which makes that test harder than it should be to mentally place within the dream in my mind.)",

    "title": "A Guide to Cancer Anxiety",
    "selftext": "Hello everyone, I've been experiencing cancer anxiety for about 2 months now due to the death of a youtuber I followed and since then I've learned quite a lot about things that I feel like be helpful to the rest of you all.\n\nNow, I'm gunna divide this into 2 parts, advice on your own body/symptoms and general advice based off of statistics. Hopefully This will help relieve your anxiety so that it subsides or goes away.\n\nAdvice on your Own Symptoms:\n\n1. Body Aches from Anxiety can be asymmetrical - Its pretty normal for anxiety to cause aches in some areas and not others, so for example if 1 arm is weaker and in more pain then the other then that's perfectly normal to experience. Based off of statistics I found that left arm pain is actually more common with anxiety then right arm pain, I don't entirely know why but I have a working theory that I'll get into next.\n2. Your Body Will Ache in the Areas you're most worried about - You tend to tense of the parts of your body that your more concerned about, Have a bump here? an ache there? Well its likely that if you're worried about that part then Anxiety will cause a feedback loop that will make that area hurt even more. This goes into what I said earlier about left arm pain, as heart attacks a common symptom is pain in the left arm. Naturally because of this, if you experience pain in both arms at first the pain in the left arm will be more worrying as it can be signaling a heart attack. Naturally this will cause you to focus on the left arm pain more and thus will make your left arm pain worse.\n3. Our Bodies are Asymmetrical - There are many cases of asymmetry in our body, for 1. Its likely that 1 of your shoulders/arms will have more prominent bones then the other, this is primarily due to hand dominance where the hand you are dominant with will have more apparent bones then the other. This asymmetry can thus tend to cause people to believe that one arm might have a bone tumor on it when in reality its just how its been normally. Another case to open up is rib flare, Our core muscles are responsible for keeping our ribs in place, and when they are too weak to do that, the ribs will flare outwards and protrude out of your skin. This is usually more apparent on the left side then the right as our right side is attached lower to the diaphragm, but it can appear to be more prominent on any of the 2 sides. If you notice a bump on your lower ribcage its unlikely to be bone cancer (only 5% of bone cancers manifest on the ribcage), and its more likely to be rib flare.\n4. Cancer Symptoms don't decrease - If you noticed that your symptoms tend to be up or down or are progressively getting better as time goes on then its probably not cancer. Cancer generally has pretty consistent symptoms that gradually get worse over time so if you noticed that the peak of your pain is behind you then its probably not cancer.\n5. Watch out for Lymph Nodes! - Something that we all have in common are lymph nodes, they're effectively tiny lumps around the exterior skin of our body that Health Anxiety people often mistaken for cancer. Lymph nodes inflame significantly for many reasons, usually when fighting an infection. Often many people mistaken these inflamed lymph nodes for cancerous tumors when they really aren't. \n\nNow, these are all the things that I found might be helpful to know about the body, now lets go ahead and talk about things that you might find online that might be helpful in decreasing your cancer worries.\n\n1. 5 Year Survival Rates are wrong - They're wrong for multiple reasons but the main one I should talk about is age bias. Cancers are often more likely to be diagnosed in older people and thus they end of greatly inflating the actual deaths due to cancer. As of now the odds of you surviving cancer is about 68% at any given age. However among 15-30 year olds the odds of survival are greatly higher. 83% in Males and 90% in Females, because of this if you see \"5 year survival rate for metastatic - 75%\" If you're younger then your actual survival rate would probably be higher then that. Another thing to note is that statistics always trail behind actual values. Most of these survival rates are studies done in the 2000s and early 2010s and are not updated for current 2022 levels. Simply because studies done more recently haven't been published and peer reviewed yet. This 10 year gap might not seem that significant but take note that in 2010 the yearly death rate for cancer was 173 per 100k and now its 144 per 100k.\n2. Selective Filtering in Reddit - When it comes to places such as reddit if you look for personal experiences then almost all of them will seem terrible. Stage 4 terminal cancer, however there's a couple things that you should note. Firstly is that people with terminal cancer are more likely to post about their cases then someone who had Stage 1 cancer and underwent surgery and a month of chemo to be cured. Secondly is that more terminal cases of cancer are more likely to be upvoted on reddit and be more recognized then someone who had a fairly mild case. Lastly is that the vast majority of reddit users are younger then the usual population that gets cancer, so often the cancer diagnosis you see on reddit will be a lot younger then what you would expect from a cancer diagnosis. Its safe to say that reddit does not represent the general population.\n3. Most Deaths In Young Adults Aren't Cancer - Not sure how much this will help you in particular but note that the vast majority of causes of deaths aren't due to cancer. Infact statistics show (atleast for my age group of 15-19). That less then 4% of deaths attributed to this age range are caused by cancer. Statistically speaking, Statistically Speaking more people at this age range are dying in car crashes in a single month then people are dying of cancer in an entire year, and more people kill themselves in the span of 4 months then people are dying of cancer in an entire year.\n\nSo yeah Hopefully this did something to help relieve your cancer anxiety, thx for reading.",

This of course took me down the pancreatic cancer rabbit hole and I’m still trying to climb out. Started manifesting symptoms, etc. \n\nThe worst thing I could’ve done was read the pancreatic cancer sub and cancer subs. I thought it would be helpful. I thought I could read through comment histories of redditors with cancer and find that they all had some red flag that I’m missing. But what always killed my anxiety is that wasn’t always the case. Not that they would mention in comments anyways. It was always just some random symptom and then cancer, otherwise always healthy, no history, young, etc. That shit triggered my anxiety worse than anything\n\nAfter a CT scan I finally moved a bit past the pancreas cancer fear, but then just last night I found a Reddit thread about cancer and perused some random persons profile and it just completely set me back. Just some random having stomach pains, only a few years older than me, and it’s cancer. Why. \n\nThere is a flip side of this though, something that helps me a lot is reading through older posts on this sub (~a year ago or many months ago) and clicking on the users profile. When you realize how many users post here with symptoms, convinced they have cancer or a brain tumor or a heart issue, and then you see their profiles and a year later they’re still totally fine or healthy, it puts into perspective how many of us have anxiety and for how few of us it will actually be legitimate.\n\nThat helped me a little bit, but now as I’m sitting here itchy as I’ve never been in the past I need to try and get past this currently anxious regression 😔",

Yes, that long, narrow country in South America. \n\nThe USA is an incredibly big, big country. I suspect most of the people in this forum are Americans. Let me tell you, your country is exceedingly big and has an incredibly huge population! My country has a very small population of only 19 million! While the USA has 330 (that's huge).\n\nIt still might not sound enough to calm your nerves. Let me tell you another thing. See it from this perspective: The USA has 50 states (a lot if you ask me). Each state has roughly the same or bigger population than my WHOLE COUNTRY!!! I looked it up and found out California has a population of 40 million people! JUST ONE STATE!!! Texas has a population of 28 million!! I mean that's a lot! So basically, you live in a country that could contain 50 COUNTRIES, with populations such as Nevada (which has 3 million which is the population of the WHOLE URUGUAYAN COUNTRY!). You basically live in a country that has 50 ''''''countries'''''''.\n\nWe basically are like ants in this world. Reddit is also the most popular forum in the USA, and the whole world. I mean even people from my country visit this forum! Each case is unique and you could be worrying about something that might not ever happen in your life! Yes, I know that we read rare cases. But the chance that it might happen to you is pretty slow! Like the lottery! You read a case. Maybe this guy is from Nevada, from Florida or from a very far away country like India! Reddit is super big.\n\nI still struggle with health anxiety but I hope this perspective might change your view on the probabilities of getting a disease. You will be fine, you are healthy, and more so, you are being proactive about your health :) so enjoy what you like :3",

Of those thoughts: 95 percent repeat each day and on average, **80 percent of repeated thoughts are negative.**\n\nThis means that on average, only 20% of our thoughts are positive per day and they are competing for our attention with the other 80%. This 80% has megaphones but you know what, **we are not helpless**.\n\n* We can help the 20% of our positive thoughts shine brighter and dominate these negative thoughts. This is where \"marinating in the positive\" and contributing to the daily positivity thread in any way you can comes into play.\n\nLet's fill this thread with some positivity from our daily lives and remind ourselves that positive things are happening while we battle the negative thoughts of health anxiety. Some examples of things you can post include:\n\n* Ordinary things you are grateful for (ex: your car started today or there is water to drink).\n* Small goals & victories you have accomplished.\n* Something you witnessed that made you smile.\n* Something you did to make someone else smile.\n* Blessings and gratitude.\n* Accomplishments of self-care.\n* Something you created today (crafts, art, a meal...).\n* Find accountability buddies and report your self progress for some type of challenge.\n\n**REGARDING \"journey updates\" standalone post**: Some of you may have been redirected here if you are providing an update on your progress via a standalone post. If you would like your standalone post to be approved, please resubmit the \"update post\" with advice in the text body (such as detailing how you got there, or what motivated you to get to where you are now, etc). This is so redditors can gain something from your post without feeling bad that they are not where you are at on your journey. The reason we do this is that Reddit is another form of social media where many can fall victim to the social comparison trap. We do not want people to feel inadequate by comparing themselves to someone else's health anxiety management journey. This is why we ask redditors to include advice in their progress updates if they want it to be a standalone thread. This way people can gain information for their health anxiety management roadmaps from your post. Feel free to resubmit your post with advice added on if you want it to be a standalone post.

If your physical symptoms aren't related to an actual disease and if you're truly healthy, these symptoms WILL disappear. But of course they may return if you stop believing in your good health and go back to thinking/ruminating about your symptoms. Thing is... Your mind needs to become habituated to this belief (and reality) that your body is indeed healthy and disease free.\n\nBELIEVING these Golden Phrases is the key to abolishing health anxiety. You need to internalize this belief and then ACT accordingly, live as if you are truly healthy and disease free. What would you do if you were without disease? Do those things/activities/tasks/responsibilities in your life whilst internalising this belief.\n\nNow do this only after you're 100% sure, after visiting doctors, doing diagnostic tests, etc that you're really disease free. Once your good health is confirmed in reality on paper, you're good to go with this technique.\n(You don't want an actual illness to be ignored and delayed treatment all the while you practice this.)\n\nThis is effective, because it's literally opposite to what you're believing all this time. In fact, it could also aid in healing an actual illness, by generating a POSITIVE OPTIMISTIC state of mind in you.",

I've recently read a post somewhere where someone said something like \"1 in 3 people get cancer\" followed by a statistic from their hometown and someone else replied how they're scared and that statistics don't help them because they think they are the 1 in 3\n\nGuys, statistics do not mean that it's absolute or decided. No, you are not a \"chosen one\" nor is there any \"choosing\" in it. People may get cancer, but probably at 70-80. And by then, you could die of million other causes, not even any illness.\n\nThe reason I, and probably many others, fear getting cancer is because you saw it somewhere around you. Like someone close dying, or hearing it in the news. But it's not something you \"catch\" or get \"chosen\" for\n\nHere's my example, both my grandparents died of cancer at 64. Will I get it in my sixties? Maybe. Will I get it now, at 17? No, I won't\n\nIt simply doesn't work like that, you can stop worrying about it seriously. It may work like that if you have a mutation since birth, and if you did, you would've known your whole life, so you really don't. \n\nPlease, stop worrying about getting it when it's probably impossible",

How difficult it is to cope with and the amount of physical pain and discomfort it can bring which can worry you further and cause you to keep searching your symptoms online for it to be matched up with serious diseases and conditions. It's the worst thing I ever have experienced in my life. And there are ways to calm it down but you just have to wait and worry until it finally decides to fully go away. \n\nBut I want to remind you all you aren't alone in this struggle, this subreddit has helped me learn that really quickly, it's not our faults we are like this yet we have to deal with it sometimes days or weeks on ends, hell probably even months for some. Just remember that if you even have a slight thought that it could be your anxiety, it 99% is likely to be, doubts are the key to realising that its probably just your brain and not anything serious actually happening. \n\nI have been struggling this last week with fears of leukemia and other cancers all because I've been having some dry skin and itching, numbness and aching most likely already caused by anxiety and the summer heat, as I had been worrying before they even happened, I've felt extremely ill and achey and even when I knew it wasn't right I've been searching up my symptoms, but I know I don't have it, it's just what you instinctually do with anxiety.\n\nFinally, if you are suffering like this please please try and seek therapy or try self treatment, take a very warm bath or shower, breathe slowly and relax, try not to overthink and once you have relieved your anxiety try not to go back to over-examining yourself and just focus on anything else, it really does help if you can manage it.\n\nBest of luck to all of you :)",

I would tell myself: so what if you're going to die? And then go about my day normally. This took several months of adamant, relentless checking myself.

I know this sounds wishful, but over time, you have to retrain your thought pattern. What happened to work for me, was just not caring. We are all going to die some die. So let go of the illusion of control, and face your anxiety, stop fighting it. Sit there and stew in the shitty feeling for a little, dare it to become worse. Do this for 10 minutes maybe, and then try to catch yourself the rest of the day and tell yourself you're now focusing on more important things. I used to literally say in my head, \"yup, i'm dying. Time to stop checking in on it now.\" \n\nThat's the problem with anxiety. When you fight it, you fuel it. You acknowledge it as legitimate, that it deserves energy.

    "title": "Finally experiencing SOME relief from health anxiety (4 months after first panic attack)",
    "selftext": "Things that have been helping me overcome my health anxiety are\n\n- being very choosy about what I’m letting into my mind. I’ll keep philosophy videos or self improvement audiobooks in constant rotation, even playing in the background when I’m not actively listening. I’ve avoided social media, google, negative conversation, gossip, and mindless talk. The brain has a way of latching on to its environment, and left unchecked, we can find ourselves surrounded by negativity, that WILL present itself in the form of thought. \n\nDO NOT GOOGLE\n\n- realizing that anxiety is just a feeling, and allowing it to take its course. Imagine the anxiety is a person, who thinks very differently from you, that you have to see everyday. Create the separation that you would from that person - observe (you will have to from time to time), but you do not have to engage with that person (anxiety). Do not avoid this person, as they will always return, often times worse. The more time you spend, giving the person their due respect, you will see they become more benevolent over time. Cursing their name will only upset them and make things worse.\n\n-exercise, clean your home, and eat mindfully. These are hard-hitters because often times with debilitating anxiety, they are hard to do. Start off small, work your way up to larger gestures. The more you do these things day in and day out, you are slowly reclaiming your mind and behaviors. The more you take care of self and surroundings, the more you can steer the narrative of your reality. This is absolutely huge. Try taking a daily probiotic, turmeric, and flax seed powder. \n\n- sleep 7-8 hours, lack of sufficient sleep is proven to increase stress hormone activity.\n\n- stay in touch with people you love, and love you. Staying alone leaves us to stew in thought, unchallenged. We need to outsource an alternative train of thought sometimes, and people who do not deal with health anxiety will undoubtedly help with life perspective. \n\nA few things I do - \n\nI started indoor cycling, starting at 1 mile. I upped my distance by .05 miles per day. AS SOON AS I WAKE UP\n\nI take daily probiotics, and eat only Whole Foods, nothing processed. I supplement with turmeric, vitamin d, b12. I consume at least 2 tbsp of flax seed powder per day. \n\nI minimized my possessions, to reduce clutter in both my space, and mind. \n\nI listen to audiobooks/philosophy everyday.\n\nI have a hard time with meditating, so when cleaning, I do so silently. \n\nI talk to somebody I love everyday.\n\nI do a therapy session once per week.\n\nTry to book bi-annual doctors/dentist visits, as far out as possible. \n\nWhen I have the anxiety sensation, I simply recognize the “person” say hello, and let them pass. \n\nI’m still learning, but I hope this helps somebody. I love you guys, & you DO have the capacity to conquer your anxiety. Stay strong.",

The whole thing, “I’ve grown tired of this body…” I think many of us have shared that sentiment at some point.\n\n\nEDIT: Another good one is Saline Solution by Wilbur Soot.

    "title": "How I beat anxiety about heart by myself",
    "selftext": "It's been almost a year of this terror and I can confidently say that I beat this motherf*cker hard. I won't talk alot about the things I experienced, but here's how it went in short terms:\n\n-I had covid, had a random palpitation caused by stress\n\n-Googled \"heart attack symptoms\", of course I immediately thought I was dying. This is how my HA started\n\n-Over the next 3 months, went to about 6-7 different doctors, did an extreme number of tests, they all came back positively. They even told me I have a higher chance of having a piano fall on my head than having a heart attack\n\n-Over the next period, I've developed many, many triggers and a psychosomatic symptom disorder. Basically I could give myself pain that was nonexistent. That meant every single action that I did, I somehow connected it to my heart. For example, I've read that salty food causes something (i don't even remember what) and my psychosomatic symptoms would appear whenever I ate something salty. This is just one example out of probably 100 more\n\n\nNow on how I've beat it. I know most of you have heard some things I'm about to say a lot of times, but please stick with me.\n\n\n1. *Resist the temptation to google symptoms/investigate diseases*\n\n\nY'all know this one but it's serious. Whenever you feel the urge to google, throw your phone away and go do literally anything. It's really that simple. I won't dwell into this one because I know you all heard it millions of times by now, but it's just that. Just don't\n\n\n2. *Exercise regularly*\n\n\nIt may sound like I'm exaggerating, but the gym has truly saved my life. Trust me, when you're working out, the last thing you will think about is your fears. Literally any form of exercise will help.\n\nAlso, I've read some posts that say they are scared of exercising because of heartrate. Look at it this way: It is normal for it to go up. That's the scenario where it's *supposed* to go up, not when you're under stress. There is zero reason to worry about heartrate going up when you're working out, so don't be afraid of that\n\n\n3. *During the worrying periods, preoccupate yourself in any way possible*\n\n\nI am a very extroverted person, so socializing and just going out always saved my days during those periods of panic. I am aware that this may be an unhealthy way, since all I'm doing is just avoiding triggers and thoughts, but it's very effective. One big downside tho, is that I still find it hard to stay alone with myself. But over time, I'm sure it will become normal again\n\n\nIf you're not a very social person, I would suggest doing any activity that doesn't make you think about your fears. Literally anything except being at home doing nothing. Go take a walk with earphones in, go anywhere where you're preoccupied\n\n\n4. *Don't be afraid to admit to yourself that you're fine*\n\n\nThis is one of the most important tips. I don't know about all of you, but I'm a very paranoid and somehow superstitious person. There were times where I was scared to say to myself that I'm fine because I was afraid of jinxing it and killing myself. I know it sounds very absurd, but it was really like that.\n\nIf you think that way, the good news is that, well, it's absolute bullshit. It's your paranoid side of mind forcing you to be scared when you should feel fine. I remember myself, in my worst panic attacks, scared to even think about being fine. Then, when those attacks stopped, I would actually get pretty angry. I remember being so angry I was screaming at God, Universe, Fate, anything, literally saying \"Go ahead! Give me a heart attack! Kill me!\"\n\nOf course, nothing happened and over time, I let go of that fear of jinxing. I can confidently say that I'm fine without worrying about something happening to me soon.\n\n\nI know the post was long, but I hope it at least helped calm down someone, if not help them overcome this. I know it's very tough and hellish, but you have to push on. If you're in hell, the only way to heaven is by going forward, right?\n\nI truly wish you all overcome this, and if you have any questions, feel free to ask, I'll try to answer them as fast as I can. Good luck!",

I am a film writer/director by trade and I currently am working on a very personal piece about a character with health aniexty who struggles to move past a bump they find on their head.\n\nMy goal with the film is to portray health aniexty in the most honest, raw, and realistic way possible. I have yet to see it portrayed correctly in media...often times it's ridiculed with horror or comedy tropes and we lose the seriousness of how challenging and debilitating it could be to live with/overcome HA. \n\nThat all being said, if you're interested in the film, please check out our kickstarter. We can use all the support we can get to help make this film possible. I totally get not everyone can donate, but if you are willing, sharing the page to your friends and family goes a long way. \n\nI'd also love to hear about your stories with depictions of HA in media and what your pet peeves may be or what you'd like to see more of.\n\nhere is the kickstarter link: [https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/leechfilm/leech-a-short-film](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/leechfilm/leech-a-short-film?ref=project_build)\n\nThank you!!\n\n\\- Dan",

    "selftext": "So a few years ago I had debilitating health anxiety and to be honest I was pretty close to the edge. I think it was brought on by a mixture of too many stresses in my life at once and  people passing away close together that I knew (and the link was formed). The good news is I beat it and live a normal life again and I believe you can too. Because I know how awful and scary it can be, I wanted to share with you what I now know on the other side were 100% definitely physical symptoms of **anxiety, not a critical illness** and maybe help a person or 2:\n\n\\- Waking up through the night feeling like I had an empty stomach\n\n\\- The sensation of oil spitting out of a frying pan onto my skin\n\n\\- Feeling weak like I could collapse any second \n\n\\- Digestive problems and IBS\n\n\\- Nightmares / Vivid dreams\n\n\\- Nausea most days\n\n\\- Heart palpitations / racing pulse\n\n\\- Chronic backache that lasted around 6 months \n\n\\- Other achey muscles \n\nI had the usual anxiety symptoms too such as panic attacks, sweating, restlessness, no sex drive, sense of impending doom etc etc. \n\nIsn't it scary what stress and anxiety can do to the human body. \n\nIf you let things get as bad as I did (which I hope you haven't), the best thing I ever did was go see my doctor and ask for help with anxiety. Once I was on regular medication and therapy, the physical symptoms faded away and one day I just realised I was driving to work with the stereo up singing my favourite song (very badly) and the thought of 'what illness do I have today' hadn't entered my head. \n\nI'm not in ANY way saying to ignore the above symptoms and write it off as anxiety, but if you are seeing a doctor about symptoms but not mentioning the anxiety...**mention the anxiety!**\n\nI wish you all well in your recoveries.

I'm getting tired of it, and now I wanna say goodbye to dr Google who is getting me more anxious with every question I ask him. \n\nI dont wanna know how much time I have wasted on searching and being stressed out about eg lymphoma (when I could feel a lymph node in my neck), subungual melanoma (when I had bruised my toe), and other stupid diseases that happen to have normal and common symptoms like sore throat, cough, runny nose,  nausea, stomach ache, itching etc...\n\nI just wanna enjoy life again, and ban dr Google from it.

She was quite thorough but did order a pelvic/transvaginal ultrasound since I have had ovarian cysts. Logically, I know she probably did this more because she sensed I was nervous but my health anxiety hasn’t let up. I literally had my ultrasound today (a day later) and was really freaked out and worrying about when I’ll get results and “what if it’s cancer?” However, all this has had me really question how I can draw the line between advocating for my health if I feel off and over testing and needless screens? Should everything come back normal or a benign condition like a UTI, I’ll be relieved but also a bit ashamed that I have now drove up my insurance and spent so much money for literally nothing. In the moment, I feel like I’m advocating but in hindsight I wonder if I’m being hysterical. How do you begin to distinguish between panicked testing and actual self-advocacy?",

    "selftext": "Hi everybody! I am 24 years old with such bad health anxiety.. I mean I’m not kidding my poor parents and friends. Recently, last 1.5-2 weeks I’ve had a pain in my right breast. I went to a new doctor today, who reassured me I was okay but offered me a same day ultrasound for peace of mind.. which I cried during and guess what ?? I am ALL GOOD :). I am not dying of breast cancer like my brain convinced me. This is a wake up call for me so I am going to offer some MUCH needed tips/ advice to you all… and myself \n\n1. Advocate for yourself. I know everyone says that but I mean it. Especially if you are young. Do not feel embarrassed, do not feel annoying. It is YOUR health.. the best ( and most probable) case is you are all good! The worst case… you listened to your body, found something early and can work on it NOW\n\n2. Unsubscribe to those Reddit threads.. you know the ones, the cancer subreddits, the diagnosing subreddits. It is so so unhelpful. Cancer/ many terminal illnesses overlap with symptoms of very easy, acute conditions. All you’re doing is increasing your stress which makes you anxious and sick. \n\n3. 2 can also apply to social media like tiktok. Seeing cancer videos is NOT a sign. The more you indulge in them, the more they pop up. Block the accounts or delete the app!\n\n4. Find somebody who you can trust that will listen to you but also not indulge in your anxieties. I know not everyone has someone so if you need it, message me! It’s ok to be scared but it’s not ok for it to run your life. \n\n5. Get outside!!!! You don’t know how important this is. Get your mind off of it. When my boob hurt I spent 4 days inside all day all night googling.. it did nothing but make me feel even worse ( anxiety does that as we all know).. go outside. Take a walk. Buy your favorite snack! Whatever you need to do for you! \n\n6.Try to practice healthy habits! Drink more water. Eat a fruit. Love life. You are okay! Please know that. \n\n\nI have been to over 15 doctors in the last 2 months but this ultrasound really was a tipping point for me. I’m done ruining my life before disease does it before me. I am young healthy and attentive to my body. If I need a doctor I will go. That’s all we can do.",

    "selftext": "I see a lot of anxiety threads that talk about “don’t worry”, do breathing exercises, or yoga… and not that those aren’t great things but for some people they don’t really do a lot and telling someone to “not worry” is quite possibly just insulting to someone with hypochondria or anxiety/panic disorders. A lot of people don’t mention Grounding Techniques, which personally helps me more than anything else.\n\nGrounding, is basically refocusing yourself away from your anxiety fixation. For this sub in particular, it’s probably googling symptoms of aneurism or cancer or tumors. It’s not so easy to just “stop googling” because for some of us, we don’t have that will power when our brain is telling us we must self diagnose because doctors aren’t always correct. We know it’s irrational, but we can’t help it. \n\nThere are tons of way to ‘ground yourself’ but these are tips that worked best for me and my adhd brain. These are not the textbook versions as I modified to help myself, but you can always look up techniques on your own. \n\n1. Sensory technique. Lay down and name 3-5 different smells, sights, sounds, and touch in your immediate surrounding. It doesn’t have to be perfect, but try to name things in your head or out loud and go into details of some things if you’d like. Touch your blanket, your pillow, your night stand, your bed, etc. really feel them. Your blanket, how does it feel? Soft? Dirty? Warm? What color is it? What kind of texture is it? You hear a fan. A clock? Crickets? What kind of clock is it? You get the idea. \n\n2. Pets. If you have pets, they help tremendously. I go pet my cat whenever my anxiety spirals. I focus on her soft fur, her purrs, and how relaxed she is. Notice their fur or skin, their size, their sounds, and their positions.\n\n3. Objects. You can do the same thing with an object. Sensory objects are great if you’re adhd. These include fidget toys and something you can fidget with in general, like a mechanical pencil, the lid on a jar or bottle, bracelets, etc.\n\n4. Touch your body parts one by one. I grab my arm. I notice how my fingers can wrap around my wrist. I touch my knee caps. I touch my earlobe because it feels good. I grab my big toe. I pull on each finger. \n\n5. Window. If you have one, this is my fav one. I sit up or stand up and look outside the window. I notice all the little details. Tbh my apt is sort of mediocre and my window view is just other apartments and a parking lot. The point isn’t that you need a beautiful window view. You just want to look at stuff. Notice things. I notice things that change daily. Something as small as the tree looks different. A car is missing or parked weird. Sometimes I see people. I usually do this only at night, so it’s harder to see and makes it easier for me to look for something.\n\nGrounding isn’t just simply diverting your attention. Sometimes listening to music, watching something fun, or trying to find some general entertainment won’t work because your anxiety is not in the mood for any of that. Grounding is more about sensory of your present around you. Because then it feels like you are fixating on something real and right now.",

I started exercising more, taking better care of myself, but despite that i would still get \"panic attacks and halluscinatory symptoms of cardiac 'stuff'\" as the doctors and my psych told me. There were periods where it would happen more often or not, and i had no idea why. It was crippling and awful. I literally just thought my anxiety was that bad(thats what the world was telling me). It was every day sometimes.\n\nFast forward to about a year ago, i had to get a new counselor and all that due to a move + divorce etc. Well this counselor asked me what symptoms i would halluscinate. He asked a lot of questions, and then he said- \"OP...These symptoms you are describing are not the typical symptoms one would experience during a panic attack. These actually sound like a low blood sugar crash\"\nAnd then it clicked, because my mom has this condition, and diabetes is in the family. I was like \"theres no way, how do you know that?\" And he was like \"i'm hypoglycemic. I know exactly what it feels like\"\n\n\nSo then that weekend i had a horrible panic attack while driving for 2 hours. I was still unsure of what my therapist had told me, after all he wasnt my actual doctor diagnosing me. But this episode was one of the worst ones ive ever experienced. I started feeling dizzy, delirious, and all of my limbs were tingling and going numb. It was scary. So the next day i went to go get a glucometer, and sure enough, it was my blood sugar all along. My blood sugar crashes if i go too long without eating. That night I was driving i hadnt eaten anything for like 12 hours. Thats why it got so bad.\n\nSince then ive learned how to manage it much better. I still have health anxiety, but now i have episodes much less often, because 1/2 of the episodes i was having were actually low blood sugar crashes.\n\nSo if you experience what i did, you probably dont have it because the condition is somewhat rare, but if you want to find out, just go get a glucometer and some lancets and alchohol pads and test strips from cvs and monitor your blood sugar for a day. If when you start feeling anxious is when your sugar starts crashing, you might have what i have.\n\nOr at least pay attention to the last time you ate. If you have an episode and you havent eaten for like 10 hours or something there may or may not be a connection ther\n\n\nLike i said, its rare, but i doubt im the only one out there like this.",

I want to tell a story about how when something actually is SERIOUSLY wrong, the body will most likely tell you with clear signals.\n\nI had a medical issue long ago, I don't want to go into details, but it was NOT dangerous and simply solved with antibiotics in a week and I was fine. We're lucky in this day and age that most of our issues can be solved with medication. \n\nBefore I went into the hospital to get tested I KNEW something was wrong. My body was screaming that something was wrong. I had a lymph node the size of a tennis ball. I could barely walk 10 meters without feeling breathless and nearly collapsing. \n\nMost people who have a disease have very obvious symptoms. Usually you can feel the symptoms without having to \"look\" for them because they are so obvious. Even people who never go to the doctor will go to the doctor for symptoms of serious diseases. In most cases it IS that bad. \n\nI know logic doesn't really work. I have convinced myself I have every kind of cancer, rabies, genetic disease, sepsis and everything under the sun. Now I'm starting to get my life back. Health anxiety and mental illness steals our time away from us, our lives. All the days I could have spent having fun and living my best life, but instead, health anxiety stole them from me. Health anxiety is the real illness in me. Not cancer,  not sepsis or anything else. \n\n I worry less about symptoms. I know even the most serious symptoms can have a benign cause. I still have relapses, but they last for a couple days now instead of weeks like they used to. \n\n Instead of assuming the worst case scenario, I now try to imagine that everything will be fine. And medicine is moving forward. Science is moving forward. Doctors and scientists are amazing. \n\nBut I just want us all to remember this. Usually the symptoms are obvious. And even if they are obvious, it still might mean that it's nothing dangerous. I had serious symptoms. I'm fine today. It was nothing. \n\nI know we can get better. I know it's possible. It doesn't mean it will completely disappear. It doesn't mean there won't be relapses. But I know we will be okay. \n\nI'll end with a quote from author Mary Renault: \n\n\"Man's immortality is not to live forever; for that wish is born of fear. Each moment free from fear makes a man immortal.\" \n\n\n\nHope this helps.",

    "title": "Changing mindset from “I fear” to “I care” (tips)",
    "selftext": "I’ve started thinking about my health anxiety as an opportunity to care about my body instead of be fearful about what’s happening. It’s really helping me feel less helpless and more capable of working through it. I think a big reason why it helps is because fear is settled by the idea of taking action, and “taking care” feels active and productive in a good way. \n\nHere are some things I’ve been doing that have helped, incase they might help you too:\n\n1. I have been more mindful of all the ways that my body takes care of me. Anxiety is fuelled by a feeling of separateness with my body - like it’s working against me and it’s up to me to “figure it out” / control what’s happening. To feel more connected and less separate from my body, I remind myself that my body works to keep me alive. I don’t understand everything it does, or why I feel the way I do sometimes, and that’s ok. It’s doing it’s job and I’m grateful. Thinking about my body in this way helps to enable a caring relationship with it instead of a fearful one.\n\n2. When I am tempted to google symptoms, I’ll do something physical to take care of my body instead - i.e. massage the area, stretch, deep breathing, drink a glass of water or tea. I google to feel like I am in control but the satisfaction (if any) is only temporary until it fuels more googling and reassurance seeking. Taking a physical, helpful action is much better at easing both my physical and mental anxiety. It gets me out of my head and focused on feeling better.\n\n3. Setting a rule that I will not make appointments out of fear that something is wrong, only out of care for my body and my health. It feels significantly different and much less daunting this way. *Context: I am very anxious about making appointments and this has become a core issue in my HA.* Setting this rule encourages me to move out of the fear mindset which oftentimes eases or removes the symptoms. I tell myself that if the symptoms are still there once the fear is gone, I’ll get it checked out.\n\nAn affirmation I have found helpful: \n“Any action I take will be because I care, not because I am scared.”\n\nI am starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel (for this cycle at least - haha) and changing my mindset in this way has been a big help. I hope it helps you too! Take care ❤️",

I read several posts on this sub that helped a little, so I want to give back to the community. \n\nThe biggest takeaway is that truly...it wasn't as bad as I'd built it up to be in my HA head. True story. I guess it depends on the person, but for me, minor discomfort. If this is what I have to do once a year as a preventative health strategy, I'm okay with that. \n\nHere are my tips: \n\nYour best friend is distraction. I did everything I could to distract myself the closer the day came. \n\nBut that didn't stop me from crying all morning. I couldnt fight all my nervousness.  Have someone go with you. It's comforting. Try to bring someone who makes you laugh. \n\nTake an ibuprofen before you leave for your appointment. I had minimal soreness later in the day and maybe that helped. Mentally for me, it felt like a proactive move.\n\nFind out if they look at your pics while you're there or after you leave. My mammogram was diagnostic rather than a screening, and I don't know if that makes a difference. But they usually have to re-do one of the angles, and it was nice because I did it right then instead of days later. The whole process wasn't prolonged.\n\nI also had an ultrasound done. If you need extra reassurance, an ultrasound can offer that. I left feeling like I'd been 100% examined. \n\nAnd finally, let the technician know if you have a raised mole or spot on either breast. I have 2 on one breast and they showed up on the scan, which caused them to have to re-scan.",

After a year of suffering awful panic attacks, and a REALLY bad 2 months with multiple er visits, I was recommended the book and podcast.  \n\nDrew (the author) is pretty blunt and mechanical and mainly focuses on CBT and exposures. He basically interprets the Claire weekes book “hope and help for your nerves” which he constantly credits. What’s good for us with health anxiety, our “exposures” can be days or weeks long so I feel like progress can be made quite fast. What got me motivated to come on here and post this, is that about 2 hours ago I had a light panic attack that normally would have A. Not been a “light” panic attack only lasting a few minutes,  and B. Would have ruined the next two days with rebound anxiety and sensitization. \n\nAnyways, if you are struggling and are having trouble with panic attacks or getting out of the house just give the book a read or listen to the podcast (I really like the podcast). We’ve got this and we CAN recover:)",

    "title": "How I fixed my globus sensation",
    "selftext": "I just want to start off with a quick disclaimer that I am by no means a doctor and this is not to be construed as medical advice. \n\nHaving had a look on Reddit and other online forums it seems like globus sensation is a very big issue, made worse by the fact that many people just can’t seem to understand why it happens or how to make it go away. Yesterday, I was delighted to find a miraculous cure to my globus sensation which I want to share with as many other people as possible with the hope that it can help you too.\n\nI (m 21) have dealt with globus sensation for around 3.5 weeks now. It began completely out of nowhere one day after an intense couple of weeks of anxiety. Even after my other anxiety symptoms had seemingly subsided, the globus sensation remained. It was super intense, I felt it constantly 24/7. I would feel a constant tightness around my throat as though a ball was stuck/ being squeezed on my throat and it would move up and down throughout the day (a couple of hours would pass between movements). Anyway, I was getting pretty desperate and tried everything, meditation, speaking to a gp, cityrizine as others had suggested etc. \n\nThen two days ago when I was talking to my mum I asked her if she could try to give me a throat massage to see if I got any relief. I laid on my back with my head on her legs and she started to rub my throat (not too hard as the neck/ throat is very delicate) just enough that I could feel some pressure on the muscles. She did it with both hands along the muscles for about 20 minutes. When she stopped…. Holy shit. My neck/ throat felt really warm and full from the massage but the tension was just gone. I was looking for the globus sensation and just could not feel it at all. For around 10 minutes I felt so relieved for the first time in almost a month, I almost started crying.\n\nAnyway, the globus sensation then came back which was a bit shit. Then yesterday in the evening we tried again, this time twice once for 10 minutes and then again for 20 minutes. And after each one I felt more and more relief to the point where I went to bed and woke up today with no pressure in my throat whatsoever. I felt the globus sensation ever so slightly today while at work but it was 1-2/10 instead of constant 7 or 8 as before. We will do another massage again tonight and hope that it goes away again. We will then do it every night until it is completely gone.\n\nIf you are struggling with globus sensation then please PLEASE ask a parent/SO/ friend you trust to give you a throat massage. Or even try going to a professional masseuse and ask for one. The relief that I felt and I hope you would too is just so overwhelming and I do believe that it could be a cure to the sensation overall. Whether caused by anxiety or reflux, we know that it is caused by tension in the neck/ throat and a massage will do wonders to relieve it.\n\nIf you do try it please comment below with how it felt and whether it helped. I’m happy to answer any questions about anything, I seriously just want to help all you wonderful brave people.\n\nG\n\nTldr- throat massages fixed my globus sensation",

    "selftext": "For me as a Sagittarius were known for independence, and I think this contributes to making HA managment more difficult just because I do not want some random disease/illness dictating my life. This then influences my HA related behavior like \"prevention via Googling\" or \"constantly checking things when I feel a symptom\". Once I get passed that though, I hope I can use the \"risk taker\" aspect of my zodiac sign to just say \"whatever happens, happens and not let HA takeover my life\". So that how I see my zodiac sign contributing to both making my HA management journey both easy and hard.\n\nWhat have been your observations with your HA management in relation to your zodiac sign?\n\nHere are some brief descriptions with the cut off dates:\n\n* *♈* *Aries* *(Ram): March 21–April 19*\n   * Along with being creative and very imaginative, they are **very kind and sympathetic**. Aries natives are very punctual and keep everything well planned. They love being sorted when it comes to planning. With everything that makes them great, their faithfulness and honest is what makes their personality remarkable\n* *♉* *Taurus* *(Bull): April 20–May 20*\n   * Tauruses have a regal quality about them. They are graceful and diligent laborers. They can be **stubborn, bull-headed, and set in their ways, but they are also great listeners and very dependable**. Taurus can absolutely go on forever.\n* *♊* *Gemini* *(Twins): May 21–June 21*\n   * Geminis are **flexible, extroverted, and clever**, and there's never a boring moment while they're around. Their flaws include indecisiveness, impulsivity, unreliability, and nosiness, therefore don't disclose a Gemini your innermost deepest fears.\n* *♋* *C*>!ancer !<\\*(Crab): June 22–July 22\\*\n   * C>!ancers!< have a reputation for being **hyper emotional, temperamental, and spiteful**. C>!ancers!<, in additional to being devoted, are extremely fond of their loved ones, often to an unhealthy degree. They place a high value on family and close friends, and will go to great lengths to defend them, no matter the price.\n* *♌* *Leo* *(Lion): July 23–August 22*\n   * Leos are the natural leaders of the zodiac, as magnificent and striking as the Lion that embodies their sign. Leos are **radiantly joyful, liberal with their appeal and endowments**. They are fiercely proud and confident. They love and live life to the fullest rather than being in charge at home, work, and play.\n* *♍* *Virgo* *(Virgin): August 23–September 22*\n   * On the appearance, Virgos are **humble, self-effacing, industrious, and practical**, but under the surface, they are frequently natural, kind, and sympathetic, as befits their zodiac sign. Virgoans are methodical and quick thinkers, yet they have so much mental energy that they are frequently stressed and tense.\n* *♎* *Libra* *(Balance): September 23–October 23*\n   * Librans are **extroverted, cosy, and friendly people**. Librans, like the Scales that symbolise the sign, are often concerned with attaining balance, harmony, peace, and justice in the world. With their vast stores of charm, intelligence, frankness, persuasion, and seamless connectivity, they are well-equipped to do so.\n* *♏* *Scorpius* *(Scorpion): October 24–November 21*\n   * Scorpios are **extremely deep and emotional people, and are intense in all things they do**. They're natural leaders and can be very serious; Scorpios are one of the most interesting signs because of their intensity, and there are some key Scorpio characteristics to be aware of that make them stand apart\n* *♐* *Sagittarius* *(Archer): November 22–December 21*\n   * A Sagittarius values independence and the ability to do what they want, when they want, above all else. They are **adventurers, risk-takers, and have a sharp business and sports mentality**. Sagittarius natives are known for their emotional intelligence, which helps them to connect with others.\n* *♑* *Capricornus* *(Goat): December 22–January 19*\n   * **Ambitious, hardworking, and enterprising** is one side of the sign. The Capricorn natives are extremely driven, enthusiastic about life, and capable of setting lofty but attainable objectives. The Capricorn natives on the other hand are lost in a world of actual or perceived barriers to achievement.\n* *♒* *Aquarius* *(Water Bearer): January 20–February 18*\n   * Aquarius people are **advanced, self-reliant, clever, exceptional, and optimistic**. Air is their elemental sign. Aquarians, like air, lack a distinct form and appear to resist classification. Others are enthusiastic and active, while other Aquarians are calm and sensitive.\n* *♓* *Pisces* *(Fish): February 19–March 20*\n   * Pisces people are known for being **emotionally sensitive, gracious, and emotionally aware**. Pisces characters are regarded for being among the most sympathetic of the zodiac signs, and they will go to great lengths to ensure the happiness of those around them. They're also creative and imaginative",

Fortunately I did not know how to use the computer at that age, or otherwise Dr. Google would have made it worst. This would have been during the 0 - 10 age bracket.\n\nIn terms of a defining event, it is definitely after completing school, and not really having anymore tasks to keep me busy. It gave me more time to notice my HA, and let it affect me even more and basically become more full blown. This would have been during the 18 - 26 age bracket.\n\nBut yeah why do you think your HA started at the age bracket you chose instead of sooner or later? Thank you for sharing your experiences.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/vgc4zx)",

    "selftext": "I have been struggling with health anxiety for over 4 years. I had variety of symptoms, the majority of them focused on the heart. Throughout those 4 years I had 2 ECGs and one echo. The first ecg was conducted at GP’s office and the other one was at cardiologist’s. The other ECG showed right axis deviation and left posterior fascicular block. The cardiologist told me not to worry about anything because it’s nothing serious and after echo my heart turned out to be completely healthy but located a bit differently in chest. However, after this appointment I felt tempted to google those things.. and the spiral began. I won’t mention the names of the illnesses since I don’t want to trigger anyone, but pretty much ever since then I have been constantly worried about some lethal Arrythmias and such. I talked to my cardiologist who told me not to worry about anything because I don’t have any Arrythmia and all of the symptoms I’d been feeling is anxiety (chest clogging, one single stronger/abrupt heart beat, fear, heart pounding) \nAnyways, I’m telling this story so that everyone who struggles with anxiety knows that googling is the worst thing one can do. Don’t ever do it - it is something not only my cardiologist told me but also my therapist and uncle who’s a surgeon. Google is trash. It will only spark your anxiety and give the worst case scenarios possible. Also I highly suggest you try these things: \n\n🌷 Mindfulness - it helped me to ease my nervous system and cope with some of my anxiety symptoms more.\n🌷CBT - A pivotal thing! If you have HA cognitive behavioural therapy will help you the best.\n🌷 Don’t google - I know it’s easier said than done but it will cause you nothing but anxiety, panic and nothing more than that. You never know who the author is and if they are really a doctor or not. This includes articles about seemingly healthy people who suddenly caught something. Media love over embellishing dramatic events and make them even more mysterious and tragic. Don’t read it. Remember, you don’t know this person’s medical and family history, whether they were checked by doctor or not, so don’t even bother to look at it.\n🌷 Focus on things you like or find a new hobby - in my case is doing stuff with beads and playing phone games (the two games I recommend is art puzzle and good pizza, great pizza) \n🌷Ignore people who are negative, trigger your HA and only make things worse.\n🌷If you have any health concerns talk to your loved ones or call the doctor. But never google.",

    "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI was recently going through a time where I had a single node that was pretty large 1.5cm in length and unknown width.  It was also pretty hard. Naturally I googled myself into having cancer shortly after I noticed it because google said hard = cancer, big = cancer, supraclavicular = cancer.\n\nI went to the doctor the next day and the doctor described it as shotty (resembling a shotgun pellet) and most likely it is nothing to worry about. He told me to come back if it didn’t go away or if it got bigger or if I got more symptoms.\n\nIt didn’t show any signs of getting smaller for 4 weeks then randomly decreased a significant amount. So even if you have a node that is hard at first or suspiciously large or in the spot where it is the highest chance to have cancer, YOU DO NOT AUTOMATICALLY HAVE CANCER, DESPITE WHAT GOOGLE SAYS.\n\nIf your node is elliptically shaped (like an egg), you are fine. If it is moveable at all, you are fine. If you don’t have awful symptoms (night sweats, fever, cough) to go along with it, you are fine. Obviously for piece of mind, I recommend going to the doctor just to have them confirm it but do not listen to Google. The confirmation bias on there is nuts for us health-anxious folk.\n\nPlease don’t worry, go get it checked out and give it a month or more to drop back to where it should be. Some nodes may stay there permanently so also be aware of that!",

    "selftext": "Thank you for choosing to read this, as a person with SEVERE health anxiety, I think about cancer all the time. You may remember me posting on this subreddit for a while, and I’ve checked in with my GP and everything went all right. \n\nI have 2 hard-ish lymph nodes on the right side of my neck, 2 on my groin, and one where my shoulder connects with my neck. For 1 whole year, and my health anxiety got to the point where I just HAD to go see a doc. The biggest one was close to 3cm, but when I got an ultrasound, everything was fine. The doc said they most likely have swollen because of a past infection, and that they were nothing to worry about. \n\nI’ve seen that only 1.1% of people presenting with lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes) have malignant lymph nodes, and the odds are even smaller If you’re under 30. Plus, If you’re under 15, I have great news! Only 800 people under 15 are diagnosed with Non-Hodgkins lymphoma and 650 with Hodgkin’s lymphoma. That’s only 1450 cases every year in the US. Think about it, compared to the huge 350,000,000 population of United States! What I’m saying is go get them checked out, the chances of lymphoma are astronomically low. \n\nI’ve also read numerous posts on people over exaggerating the size of their lymph nodes. “I think it was 4 cm” or “they felt huge!” If you have health anxiety you most likely have read that swollen lymph nodes are larger than 1.5 cm, and people always think their lymph nodes are bigger than that. I thought my lymph nodes were like 3 cm, but when I used a ruler and drew an oval the size of 3 cm, it was way bigger than my lymph node. Soon discovered it was only 1.4 cm! So unless your lymph nodes are the size ranging from a grape to a golf ball, you’re pretty likely to over exaggerate the size of it. \n\nOne more thing, as long as they are not growing, changing, or spreading, it is most likely nothing. If you have no symptoms for a long time with swollen lymph nodes, your most likely fine as well! People with lymphoma notice big changes to their body, wild night sweats, fevers, all sorts of pains!\n\nOnce again, go get them checked out! Overcome your fears, I know you can do it!",

    "title": "At some point, the world is random... and that's okay",
    "selftext": "Hi! This is something I've been thinking of lately that's actually really helped me. Trigger warning: this post will deal with confronting and making peace with the possibility of illness. If you are not there yet mentally, feel free to skip over this post :)\n\nSo, I have health anxiety. It began about five months ago, and I've had a lot of ebbs and flows regarding how I feel about illness, how scared I am of it, and to what degree I am willing to change my life to prevent it. Last month, I had a run-in with a dog who bit my dog while playing aggressively. Because I googled what to do with him, I fell down a rabbit hole that sparked a fear of rabies. Rabies, due to the nature of the disease, is quite awful to fixate on, and that made it all the more enticing for my brain to do just that.\n\nThe good thing, though, is that I live in America. A country that has gone extremely far to eradicate the disease, resulting in an average of only 2.5 people each year dying of it. Nonetheless, though, I had a very real fear of contracting it. I even called public health officials, talked to my dog's vet, and just generally spent a lot of time googling. During all of this, it never sunk in that the odds may just be too low for me to contract rabies. To illistrate this point, let me talk about my exact scenario: the odds of a dog having rabies in the first place in the USA is roughly 60 in 85,000,000. literally a one-in-a-million chance. In my city specifically, there has not been one rabid dog in the past nine years. Second, I wasn't even the one who got bit, my dog was. But, I came in contact with the saliva, and there was a cut somewhere near my fingers where rabies could have gone into my bloodstream. Next, the dog was acting fine, so it would have had to have been in the 3-5 day period before symptoms showed that he passed it on. Lastly, vets are required to do an autopsy of any animal suspected of rabies death, and when a dog is diagnosed with rabies it makes a pretty big splash. So the odds of me hearing about it are very high so I can seek the 100% effective treatment for myself. So my odds were truly astronomically low. Probably in the hundred millions if not billions. I was even recommended to not seek treatment and not worry by my county's rabies public health representative.\n\nI didn't tell that story for any other reason than to say that my brain on anxiety simply doesn't care about the odds. When my brain wanted to think irrationally about an illness, it doen't matter if it the disease is rare. Because I *could* have been in contact with the one-in-a-million dog, he *could* have been contagious without being symptomatic, his saliva *could* have gotten into the old cut on my hand, and he *could* have not gone to a vet when he got super sick so I would never know about it. So I knew I would never win over my illness just by convincing myself that the odds were too low. The only way I could win over my illness was by digesting, understanding, making peace with, and actually **appreciating** the randomness of life! \n\nYes, all of the terrible things I mentioned could have gone exactly right, and I could be about to die. But that's okay.  Some people will die in their twenties. Some people have died far before their twenties. But I realized I'd rather succumb in my twenties than live a long without ever taking the chances necessary to actually fill my years with the joy of randomness. That realization made me get off my couch, put down my phone, and go live my life. It scared me at first because fear made me feel safe, but soon my life was so filled that I didn't have room for health anxiety. I got healthier and less worried. I actually began to overcome my fear.\n\nAs long as I take all of the reasonable precautions, I don't have a lot of control over whether my life is long or short. So I decided I would be safe and smart and **also** fill my life with randomness, adventure, and fun. Because, regardless of whether I'm going to have a long or short life, I want it to be filled with fun and adventure. I still have my moments with anxiety, but they're fewer and farther between. I trust myself more, and I trust the random way of the world to care for me. I’m right where I need to be, and that’s okay. \n\nI hope this helps, and feel free to use me as a resource any time you feel like your anxiety is getting to be too much :)",

If you have a recurring health worry about a particular sensation, then go back to your primary care physician and have them put your mind to rest about that sensation. That may mean getting more tests run. Sometimes it helps to have that extra reassurance of further tests to really put a health worry to bed, but once you get that reassurance, trust it and stop second-guessing it! There's a saying that anxiety is like a disease of uncertainty. Don't fall into the trap of letting your anxious mind doubt your own health, especially when everything else is telling you otherwise.\"\n\nI thought some of you might benefit from this quote. I would recommend giving the book a read if you are struggling with HA. I am currently practicing it for both HA and GAD with some OCD tendencies. It is hard work but will be worth the payoff.

Please focus on **Health Anxiety.** There are other subreddits for things that are non-HA related  ( r/Anxiety, r/depression, r/AskDocs, r/socialanxiety, r/mentalhealth ). Take the time to comment on each other's entries to show some support while we traverse through HA together. \n\nOnly post a standalone thread if it mainly includes the mental aspect of HA. **Everything else goes in this thread.** This megathread is used to prevent any unnecessary distress on somebody who is not mentally prepared to engage with the above content (Imagine scrolling down on your main general feed to relax, but bump into something distressing instead). HA is very unique in which it is very easy for someone to read something/experiences and then come out thinking you may have something after reading it.

He described everything id been feeling and i finally got some long needed answers. \n\nOur problem is that We look for diseases/conditions that have such a low chance of being true, just because They are scary, that We look over a condition We actually have.

    "selftext": "For me it was \"Ignore it\". The person who gave me this advice probably meant well, but it was a bit misguided though as I went through life with HA. I guess there is a difference between ignoring it and actively silencing the health anxiety. When you ignore it, the anxiety is still there and it kinda grows. Also that response of running away from it grows stronger, and it further feeds the anxiety. As oppose to telling your anxiety to be quiet and actively escorting it outside your brain which is like facing it head on. As a result you strengthen that brain pathway and response, and are able to do it again and again quicker than the last time. I just tell myself **\"this is just my health anxiety being whack, and I am good\"** while taking some deep breathes. It is almost like a workout for your brain when you actively silence the anxiety.\n\nI also do this thing now where I keep scores. So I have a piece of paper and I just make tally marks every-time a specific symptoms triggers my HA. I guess it helps to show myself the number of times I have faced that specific trigger, and came out alright. It is also nice to see the amount of times that I am triggered decrease overtime too. It also nice to see which symptoms you end up beating, so when a new symptoms comes along you get a nice boost in your mental fortitude to deal with the new symptom. Paper would look something like this, and I just refresh it monthly --> \n\n||Symptom 1|Symptom 2|Symptom 3|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Week A|(tally marks) l l l l|ll||\n|Week B|l ll|ll|lll|\n|Week C||l|ll|\n|Week D||l|l|",

    "title": "What are some ways that people from the Health Anxiety community spend more (money, time, resources) than people who do not have Health Anxiety? What was your solution to cut back on this HA driven spending?",
    "selftext": "For some of us who live with HA, managing it means not letting HA drive our spending habits. Especially in the beginning when it is hard to notice these things. So what are some ways that you feel like your HA has made you spend more time, money, and resources. Here are some of my big consumers and some of the ways I would deal with them now in hindsight:\n\n* (1) In the beginning you might have to pay for inadequate sessions from therapist who do not know how to address HA. Sometimes it is just not in your therapist's skillset to treat your HA.\n   * Solution: You can always email a therapist, and ask if they have experience with treating HA. On the website [psychologytoday.com](https://psychologytoday.com) the therapists in your area have their contact information available.\n* (2) Spend a bit more time to find a proper therapist who can treat you HA. \n   * My solution: I tell myself it is worth it, and it is saving me time in the long run from having to find another therapist. I also remind myself it is my money and time.\n* (3) Having to drive a little farther for a more adequate therapist that can treat HA.\n   * My solution: Let your therapist know that driving might be an issue, and they might be open to a hybrid treatment plan like where you see them in person once a month and three times online in the same month.\n* (4) Amount of gas you use to drive to appointments for unnecessary test, reassurance, or ER visits.\n   * My solution: After my initial doctor's appointment where they find nothing wrong, I mark that day on my calendar. I then mark another date that is 45 days later, and write down the symptom. From there until 45 days, I cannot go to the doctor for that same reason. It has to be painfully obvious for me to break that rule. The symptoms seem to go away after that. Note: when I first went through HA I ended up spending $300 on gas alone from driving back and forth to a 24/7 urgent care in the span of a month.\n* (5) Sometimes paying out of pocket just to get that reassurance.\n   * My solution: Accepting that reassurance is not the answer for long term HA management. Accepting that living with HA is like allergies, when it starts acting up you do what you need to do to get back to \"normal\". In this case grounding techniques, take the medication, and not giving into HA. Also maybe reexamine your relationship with your doctor, and ask yourself why you do not trust them (and if it is worth it finding a new lifelong doctor to help you manage your HA). \n* (6) Having to call in sick more often at work because your health anxiety is really bad that day.\n   * My solution: Sometimes we need a mental health day and those are fine. When it does become excessive, maybe asking your boss if WFH is possible or negotiating with your boss a schedule that works for you (especially if your HA is more active at a certain time of day). And of course there is always finding a new job that fits your HA lifestyle.\n* (7) Might fall for health scams easier (like alternative medicine, paid seminars from influencers, teas, therapies).\n   * My solution: Realistically we want to spend and 'shop therapy' has become a real thing that people turn to when managing their mental health. If telling myself that these things are *scams* don't help, then I do the following: (1) set a budget of $20, (2) set a date when that money can be spent like the end of the month, (3) keep a list of the things you may want to spend that money on so that you can compare those items at the time of the month you are spending. I find that if I don't let myself spend, then there will be this one day where I uncontrollably spend on these scams (way pass $20). \n* (8) Might be more prone to buying health food that you end up not eating.\n   * My solution: If you have bulk bins and the health food is available there, then get a tiny sample before buying a big package. Also finding a recipe you like, and buy all your necessities first (remind yourself you have to make 7 days worth of meals). If there is room in the budget buy the health food. If there is not enough then rollover the leftover money into next week's grocery budget. Overall that health food might be \"preventing something your scared of\", but it should not be the priority in your groceries.\n* (9) Wasting time on worrying instead of resting/sleeping/enjoy-life.\n   * Solution: I just always remind myself that worrying does not benefit me whatsoever. I try to visualize the worry as a piece of paper that I crumple up and throw as far away as I can. I keep repeating to myself \"worrying is not helpful, everything will be fine\". I trust my body and just go to sleep. When I wake up that is when I self reflect, and say \"wow we go through it, and it was just my anxiety\". \n* (10) Wasting time on Dr. Google.\n   * Solution: Of course avoiding Dr. Google is the strategy to go, but in the beginning it is not that easy. If I ever get to the point where I am consulting Dr. Google, I at least set a timer (like 5 minutes). It is so easy to lose track of time, and time is valuable to us in the HA community. Also that 5 minute timer forces me to skim rather than get immersed in the article's information. As I learn to accept that Dr. Google is not helping anybody, that is when I can investing time in learning how to install apps/extensions that can act as guardrails to not consult with Dr. Google.\n* (11) Wasting money on monitors.\n   * Solution: Things like BP monitors, Oximeters, EKG monitor that use your fingers, AppleWatch, etc. may seem helpful in the beginning, but realizing that this is a form of 24/7 reassurance helps me cut back. I always keep the box in case I do fall into the trap of buying these things, so that I can return them when I come to my senses. If it is pass the refund date, you can still return these to store for store credit. So in my experience I always keep the box/packaging. Also if you promise yourself to only buy these person instead of online, you give yourself that buffer to talk yourself out of it while driving/walking/bussing to the store.\n* (12) Time being taken away from me by an influencer giving health advice or sharing a health experience.\n   * Solution: I have two strike rule when it comes to following influencer/friends/family. If they triggered my HA in anyway that is a strike, and when it is two I take action on my end of things as a viewer. I can unfollow the influencer, or mute that friend/family-member. At the end of the day, I have a lot of things to do and getting triggered via social media is preventable or can be greatly reduced. \n\nSo those were some of the ways that HA dictated how I spent my money, time, resources. Learning to live with HA, we have to identify when we are overspending and cut back accordingly, thus taking back our lives.\n\nIf you had any experiences (similar or different) of overspending money, time, or resources due to HA please share! Also let us know if you found a solution or not. Thanks for taking the time to explore this intersection of mental health and money through an HA focused lens.",

    "title": "Reddit and other internet health forums have made my Health Anxiety worse. Some thoughts and maybe some words of caution…",
    "selftext": "EDIT: I want to clarify that I am not talking about HA forums or spaces. Those are great! I am more so talking about forums and subreddits about the illnesses that we fear. \n\nAs someone with chronic illnesses as well as HA, I tend to frequent Reddit for information. I have some thoughts. I know that the internet in general and Googling is bad for HA. But Reddit and internet health forums can be particularly intense. Every time I go on a sub or other health forum that’s about a particular illness, it feels like no one is ever going to get better and that there are no solutions to anything. It’s like this suffocating atmosphere of hopelessness. Everyone seems to be drowning with no life guard around. \n\n\nAnother is that it’s also really common to find people saying that doctors are not to be trusted because they will misdiagnose you or tell you that it’s ‘just anxiety.’ I know that doctors can be wrong and they can be problematic, but when a person with HA constantly hears that doctors can’t be trusted, it really gets bad. This advise sent me on an endless spiral of blood work and tests because I kept thinking that there MUST be something wrong that the doctor is missing. Cause that’s all I was reading on the internet. I am not denying that many people get the run around from doctors or that good doctors are hard to access. I’ve been there myself. But, the large amount of people saying that all collectively on the internet can really further warp an anxious person’s mind and make them feel like there is no hope at all. Something we need to be aware of is that people who are happy and satisfied don’t often come on the internet to vent or express their suffering. This knowledge can help when navigating such places. \n\n\nAnother thing is that because it’s the internet, people tend to use really intense words when describing their illness to convey the seriousness of it. I am not saying this in a way that’s invalidating of the person’s pain. It’s just that sometimes the usage of words  need to be taken in the context of it being on the internet. People really want to connect and/or get help or advise. Because it’s hard to convey emotion through text and because there are so many people on the internet, it feels like you need to use really intense words to prove the suffering. \n\nWhat I am saying is not that the person is exaggerating but rather that the person is afraid of being invalidated because their suffering is probably invisible to those around them and especially invisible on the internet. Therefore, I think that they tend to use words that make everything look hopeless and dark and on the brink of collapse to alert people that they are really in need of assistance or comfort. It’s something a person with HA might need to be aware of when frequenting places such as these in order to have a more balanced view on a particular illness. On every illness sub or forum I see people saying, “ This illness is absolute hell!” Or “ I can’t take this anymore!” There is a surplus of posts like these. What we don’t see is the rest of the person’s life. We don’t see that there are other parts to their day. Seeing an over saturation of posts like these on those subreddits can seriously overwhelm and confuse a person with HA. That being said, there is a lot of good info and support you can find on forums as long as you know to navigate them responsibly.\n\nAnyway, I am going to work hard to reduce my consumption of such info. \n\nAnyone else have any thoughts or experiences on this matter?",

    "selftext": "I’m a 27 year old living in the UK, I’m fairly fit and active but not as much as I could be. I’ve been having a lot of anxiety for the past two months about my heart, I’ve been feeling really strange aches and sensations towards the left side of my chest, but it can also happen on the right from time to time. I wouldn’t class the sensation as a pain, as it’s more of just an uncomfortable feeling, which I was very aware of and I’d panic myself silly about it.\n\nI went to an Urgent Treatment Center for a check up, they tested my blood pressure, oxygen levels and I had an ECG. All came back absolutely fine. I was very relieved, for all of about 10 minutes. My journey home I just started panicking again. ‘What if they missed something’ or ‘I didn’t have the aches when they did the tests’\n\nNevertheless, I ended up back in the UTC yesterday with the same problems, convinced myself something was wrong with me. This time they took some blood, did an X-Ray on my chest and also gave me another ECG.\n\nGuess what? They were all absolutely fine. The doctor basically assured me that what I was feeling wasn’t cardiac or lung related, and that it could be a sensation that’s brought on by my anxiety. Long story short, if there was anything even remotely wrong with me, they would of found something. I have to accept that it’s just a symptom of anxiety. \n\nI urge anybody who hasn’t been to get checked out, to do so. The reassurance that comes with it is priceless. If you have been checked out and you’re fine, we have to try and start trusting the results. It’s a hard process but we can do it, we aren’t alone! \n\nFinally, I have to say I’m very lucky and privileged that I can get this reassurance from the amazing NHS service, completely free of charge. I’ll never take that for granted.",

    "title": "For the health anxiety community, what are examples of implicit bias they may experience in healthcare? Why would a person with health anxiety be reluctant to reveal they have HA to their provider/physician? What are some creative solutions that can be implemented to battle implicit bias?",
    "selftext": "The word “bias” refers to a negative or positive idea a person has about someone or something. A person’s bias can affect how they interact with people of certain groups.\n\nAn implicit bias is a bias that a person is unaware of. A person who has an implicit bias may believe they treat everyone equally. However, the person’s implicit bias may cause unconscious negative associations toward certain groups of people.\n\nTo help illustrate this, here is an example of implicit bias with the plus size community in healthcare:\n\n>Oftentimes doctors will resort to weight loss as a suggestion for any ailment for any illness. That can be a real problem if your issue has nothing to do with weight loss, and they tell you the cure is weight loss you're going to know they are not really caring. They are just looking at your body and making a judgement based on that.\n\nAs you can see with the above example that person would feel dismissed, and that they are not being taken seriously (which can really affect trust and the doctor/patient relationship).\n\nAny group can experience implicit bias in the healthcare system including the HA community. So what would be some examples of implicit bias that the HA community faces in healthcare?\n\n**One way I have experienced this** was during the discharge process where they will just discharge me without really explaining the results of the scan/blood-test/etc, and really try to rush me out the door. I have been to the same facility for different things, and they would usually take their time and ask if we have additional questions. So I found that difference odd, and it definitely makes me not want to reveal my HA status next time. Another example is ever since I revealed my HA status to my doctor I keep getting this push to get on an antidepressant on every visit with my doctor despite telling them I have prescription anxiety, and letting them know I am working on it in therapy.\n\n**One solution for implicit bias in healthcare could be role-play training**, so that providers/nurses who have never experienced HA can understand how it feels from our side. I think for many of us before we identified as someone who is living with HA, we had a completely different idea of what HA is and how it feels. **For many of us once we started having HA it was beyond what we imagined it was**, and I think that is what is happening here. When we are receiving dismissive care/advice it is usually from someone who has never experienced this (also they are unaware they are being dismissive or being perceived as dismissive). When I am receiving care from a nurse/doctor who does **at least have anxiety** the care is usually better/comforting/attentive. So I believe there is that dynamic at play, so that can be one solution.\n\nThanks for your input!\n\nPoll: Have you experienced implicit bias (IB) in healthcare as a member of the HA community?\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/uybriv)",

    "selftext": "I'm struggling with the health anxiety for last three years. I had my ups and downs. I have been always an anxious person, but not in correlation with health. \n\nEverything started with pain in my chest in the middle of the night. I woke up and I had no idea what is going on. First thing I did I googled my symptoms. After some time I went to the doctor, I did whole body check. Everything was fine - healthy, young 27 years old guy. \n\nBut from time to time I still had pains in my chests. I started feeling dizzy, breathless, I had problems with sleeping. Being alone at home drove my crazy. I was sure that staying alone equals risk and death. I had problems with travelling, my home was my save place. \n\nI was going with all these symptoms from doctor to another, I had multiple blood tests, EKG, echo, rtg etc. Nothing. I felt that doctors are missing something and my days are counted. \n\nOnce, I was even refused help in the emergency clinic in the middle of night, since doctor told me I was there already three times and they won't do the EKG anymore. \n\nFinally, after 4 months of constant fear, one of doctors suggested I should go to psychiatrist.\n\nDuring the visit I was shaking and burst in tears. I got SSRI. \n\nThe first two weeks of adopting to SSRI were the worst period in my health anxiety. I had panic attacks everyday, the medicine increased already high levels of fears and doom. But after this period, it was only better. \n\nAfter some time I started going to therapy. Then pandemic started. Surprisingly, I was not anxious about getting covid. I got it eventually during spring of 2021 and, besides one panic attack, it was mild. \n\nWith SSRI and therapy I learnt again to stay alone at home, exercise, travel alone and live normally. There was no need for medication and I felt I am prepared to work on my own when anxiety will come again. \n\nAnd then, my legs started cramping after covid vaccine. And I did the worst thing I could do. I googled. \n\nLong story short - I came back to therapy, I'm also taking pregabalin now. There are good and bad periods. Sometimes days are ok, sometimes there are some body pains or worse periods in my personal life. And that's ok. \n\nIt might impossible to remove pains and worries. We have to live with them, but not put too much attention there. \n\nDuring this journey I learnt multiple things about myself and coping. But maybe we should not use word \"coping\", maybe \"accepting\" is better?\n\n* DO NOT GOOGLE - if you have some symptoms, wait couple days. If there are still there, go to a doctor\n* exercise - even small walk or stretching are great, do small steps\n* when you feel anxious, be gentle to yourself. But don't dive too much into the thoughts. Thoughts are thoughts, not facts. Sometimes small pain in my rib I was able to exaggerate to the worst case scenario\n* you are better tested than 90% of population, remember that\n* Ask for help when you need\n* When you feel rising wave of anxiety, lean towards it and allow to come. The more you fight the harder it gets\n* Accept everyone dies at some point. The time of our death is already set. It is outside of our control. Being healthy and fit, doing checks from time to time is fine, but it may become and reassurance habit on its own\n* during your time with anxiety you developed some habits and correlations. Mostly based on wrong assumptions. Here's an example. I made a correlation that pain in my chest equals heart attack. But you may have other pains there. For me, changing that is the hardest part. I have bad posture, so sometimes I feel pain in different parts of my torso. And always my first thought is the worst\n\nThe health anxiety will change you as a person. And that is fine. But try to live as you would like to, one day at a time.",

Remember this is not a place to give or ask for medical/pharmaceutical advice, or promote alternative medicines/therapies. Please focus on **Health Anxiety.** There are other subreddits for things that are non-HA related  ( r/Anxiety, r/depression, r/AskDocs, r/SuicideWatch, r/socialanxiety, r/mentalhealth ). Take the time to comment on each other's entries to show some support while we traverse through HA together. \n\nOnly post a standalone thread if it mainly includes the mental aspect of HA. **Everything else goes in this thread.** This megathread is used to prevent any unnecessary distress on somebody who is not mentally prepared to engage with the above content (Imagine scrolling down on your main general feed to relax, but bump into something distressing instead). HA is very unique in which it is very easy for someone to read something/experiences and then come out thinking you may have something after reading it. This is why we take these precautions and use a megathread. We are here to accommodate everyone at various stages of their HA.

Being worried, feeling that sense of impending doom, the shaking and tingling. Every symptom I have always makes me think I have something wrong with me. \n\nMy HA has gotten so bad to the point even when I feel no symptoms whatsoever, I feel like something bad is happening. Paranoia at its finest. \n\nIf I have a headache I will think I have a brain tumor. If my chest slightly hurts I will think I am having a heart attack. If my side hurts I'll think I have Appendicitis. HA is an awful condition. \n\nMy anxiety has ruined a lot for me, it has made me not want to even leave my bed. \nIt has taken full control over me. But what my brain fails to realize is that my body is MY body, not my anxiety's body. \n\nI just want to feel at peace. I want to feel okay and protected. I want to feel safe. \n\nPeople always tell me I am too young to worry, which yeah I am young but that doesn't stop me from having worries. \nI am under so much stress. Every day is a new day of worrying. It's exhausting, so very exhausting.\n\nI wouldn't wish HA on anyone. It's so life ruining.\nBut I saw a post that made me realize something.\n\nAnxiety isn't my enemy, anxiety is trying to save my life.\nOur anxiety is made to keep up from getting hurt. Our anxiety is the reason we don't run in front of traffic. But sometimes our anxiety makes things worse rather than making things better.\n\nIm aware I have an anxiety+panic disorder. But I think it's time for me to really accept the fact that I have it. Instead of making my anxiety seem like a big monster, I should treat it as an acquaintance. Although me and my anxiety aren't good friends, we do know each other very well. \n\nSo this is my journey on accepting my anxiety for what it is.",

    "selftext": ">Thanks in advance for anyone who took the time to read and participate in this discussion regarding the intersection of ableism and health anxiety. \n\nFor many of us accepting that death is an inevitable part of the human life cycle is major part of overcoming & living with HA. \n\nHowever there is some HA out there that can be fueled by the possibility of becoming **more disabled** (either by: age, accident, or biology). We all have been disabled once in our lives. Some examples that are temporary include having a broken arm, broken leg, or being [pregnant](https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/fact-sheet-small-businesses-pregnancy-discrimination). Some disabilities are manageable such as [asthma and allergies](https://www.aafa.org/asthma-allergies-and-the-american-with-disabilities-act). And of course there are the more common examples. \n\nThis HA fuel, fear of experiencing discrimination that ableism has to offer, is understandable. Especially observing the groups oppressed in ableism and their history.  For example the [Ugly Laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugly_law):\n\n>Between 1867 and 1974, various cities of the United States had **unsightly beggar ordinances**, in retrospect also dubbed **ugly laws**. These laws targeted poor people and [disabled people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability). For instance, in San Francisco a law of 1867 deemed it illegal for \"any person, who is diseased, maimed, mutilated or deformed in any way, so as to be an unsightly or disgusting object, to expose himself or herself to public view.\n\nWe are also dealing with a lot of conversations where the disability community voice is not usually heard. For example [banning plastic straws](https://creakyjoints.org/advocacy/plastic-straw-bans-bad-for-people-with-disabilities/):\n\n>Many people with all kinds of disabilities and special needs rely on straws to consume food and beverages for hydration and nutrition, as well as to participate in social and recreational activities. Without plastic straws, they would be unable to consume food or beverages offered at businesses or might have an unrealistic obligation placed on them to carry around and care for their own reusable straws\n\nThe two examples above are just the tip of the iceberg of how the disability community has been treated unfairly. So do you think it would fuel your HA less if you knew that the disability community was treated better (basically not having any extra obstacles such as oppression while managing their life with their disability)? In other words, if you saw more people advocating for the disability community would your health anxiety be more at ease?\n\nWhat would you tell someone whose health anxiety is fueled by the fear of the possibility of becoming disabled? At the end of the day no one wants to be oppressed. Life is hard enough as it is. The way that society views disabled people is a social construct (like race, gender, color, class, species, [etc](https://www.awis.org/intersectionality/).) and it can be changed for the better.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Thanks again for reading.

    "title": "Top Tips for managing and stopping health anxiety",
    "selftext": "1: Go to the doctors.   \nIf you think you have HA or health anxiety, have a doctor check if your symptoms are real, and not from anxiety. If not, you are totally fine and have nothing to worry about. Even as a person with HA, checking with my doctor and assuring I have nothing makes me feel much better. Id say this helps with 60% of my HA.\n\n2: Never search your symptoms.  \nEspecially on google. Google always says you have cancer or any other serious disease no matter what symptom you search for. This is because Google doesn't know how bad your symptoms are, how long they lasted, or the details. It is also because cancer makes you have all of the common symptoms people have, so that’s why cancer pops up with any symptom search. Again, your doctor will give you the real information!\n\n3: Distract yourself as much as possible\n\nTry learning a new sport, language, instrument, or anything that will make your mind shift focus to something else long-term. If you are too lazy to do that, something like playing a heavily focusing video game can temporally take your mind off the worry. Anything that shifts your focus will help! \n\n4: Delete the app you search your symptoms on.\n\nSelf explanatory. If you can’t search your symptoms, you’ll think less of it. This tip really helped me as well.\n\n5: Think positive \n\nThinking positive will help eliminate all your worst-case scenario thoughts.  It may be unbelievably hard, but setting up a routine every day can help a lot. \n\nThank you for reading. We’re all in this together!",

Atm I am stressing about a small lump in my groin, it’s probably a cyst but of course I’m thinking the worst. \n\nAnyway, I have decided that I am going to leave it a week. If it’s not gone in a week I will call the doctors, if it is gone then happy days. I figured in the meantime I’ll be feeling stressed anyway so might as well make the most of it and try and challenge my HA. \n\nSo, I’m going to challenge myself to go 7 days without symptom checking. Anyone want to join me on a bit of a HA challenge?? \n\nMake your own rules but mine are \n1. No conscious symptom checking (I say conscious because sometimes I feel something out of pure habit, so I mean I won’t go looking for things to worry about) \n2. Be proactive about mental health recovery, medication, journaling ect \n3. Try and get up early and have an hour calm before the children wake up \n\nFancy joining? We can keep each other updated and hype each other up throughout the week :D",

    "selftext": "Health anxiety is grand bitch, it's got a positive feedback loop, where anxiety generates more physical symptoms and makes the anxiety even worse. For me, I notice the physical symptoms of anxiety way before being aware that i'm anxious, for me i'm just -thinking- that makes it all the more credible.\n\n# You've got this!\n\nNo matter how scared and anxious you are right now. Know for a fact, that there will come a moment where you will feel normal and safe in your body. Wake up and focus with me a little bit. Deep deep inside you know that you are gonna feel normal again and that you're not gonna die, however you can't afford to not consider the worst case, because 'what if' this time the unthinkable happens. No, the worst case almost certainly won't happen and deep inside you know that also.\n\n# Practice Gratitude\n\nOne of the things that helped me battle with HA is to fight it in moments of strength not just in weakness. So whenever you get out of an anxiety episode. Note that \"It was just anxiety, i'm thankful, i'm stronger, this is progress\". This will help your subconscious mind recognize anxiety as anxiety more often. Not to mention that gratitute is a good practice that can improve your overall mental well-being.\n\n# Memento Mori - Deaths brings meaning and value to life\n\nEverybody is gonna leave this place, whether they are anxious about it or not. I've found some valuable stoic quotes on anxiety helped me a lot  \n\"We suffer more in imagination that in reality\" -Seneca  \n\"The whole future lies in uncertainty, live immediately\" -Seneca  \n\"Worrying is like paying a debt we don't owe\" -Mark Twain  \nThe Stoics have encouraged dwelling on death as a way to live fully and recognise the value of life. Luckily us with health anxiety are dwelling on death on a regular basis. Channel your dwelling from fear into realizing how valuable is the time that we have here, don't keep it only fear based dwelling. You've got this. You are capable.\n\n# Coping is in the moment\n\nAll these ideas could provide some good insight, but coping with HA comes down to how you deal with it in the moment, i've found that one of the best ways that have worked for me personally is to do nothing. If you're able to recognize that it's anxiety, you've done 90% of the work. 10% is doing nothing, your subconscious mind reacts to what you do.\n\nIf you get up, start googling, start moving around, you are reinforcing the idea that something is wrong and you need to do something about it.  \nIt has been invaluable to me to apply meditation principles when i get anxiety. Recognize it, accept it, it's not your fault, surrender to the moment, it's gonna pass, you don't need to fear anxiety, you've dealt with it numerous times and you're still here. Your mind will assume that nothing must be of concerning since you're doing nothing.\n\n# You CAN and with time you WILL overcome HA\n\nYou are getting stronger and stronger with each anxiety episode, recognizing anxiety for the bitch she is, you are amazing. HA can be overcome. Many have overcome it. Most people in their journey will leave this subreddit at some point, to avoid triggers altogether. An old post has mentionned this, but more people have overcome this condition than we see here. Cause most will just never come back here.  \nAnd you are entirely capable of overcoming it as well, just know that it takes time and treat yourself with the love patience and empathy that you deserve.",

    "title": "HA recovery won't be linear (my experience for now)",
    "selftext": "Quick context: I've had HA since 2015 and I fairly recently realised it is something we can actually heal/recover from. I read a lot about the tools used to break the anxious cycle, I've been practicing them as best as I can and I have a psychologist who helps me with CBT tools.\n\nLast week was awesome. I had very low anxiety levels, very few symptoms and I did not obsess over them more than necessary. I felt at peace a majority of the time, very close to life before HA, and I felt so so proud of myself for that. I exercised, saw my best friend, went to appointments, exercised some more... All things I had been avoiding or was very afraid to do.\nI can feel the new, healthier thinking patterns and behaviours I'm learning slowly becoming a more automatic response when anxiety arrives (I even managed to use an affirmation in the middle of a nightmare, haha!).\n\nBut during that week, as much as I was enjoying the present moment, I was even more afraid of losing that again. I didn't want to relapse in HA, I was scared of the moment when more symptoms would show up again, ruining all my efforts.\nWell... Of course, it happened. Underlying anxiety since Monday, more scary physical symptoms, and me jumping back to the old thinking patterns, the checking, the fixating, the bad scenarios...\nTo me, it's clear what caused it: some stressful things going on in my life, but also, the fact that *I still see anxiety as a danger*.\nAnd of course, perceived danger results in anxiety, which is more perceived danger, which is more anxiety, which... etc.\nToday, I realised that as long as I will label anxiety as a danger, a threat to my life, I will still have a foot in the anxiety cycle. And it's okay, because even though it looks like I lost my progress, I actually didn't. Proof is, I remembered to use the tools, I could journal for a while and now I can very calmly write a post on here, when this wouldn't have be been possible months ago.\n\nI think it makes sense we still fear anxiety when things are getting better. After all, we did live months or years or decades with a debilitating anxiety that has ruined our life. It's only natural we see it as a threat and a danger once we find more stability, especially after we've made so much effort to find it. So I'm not mad at myself. I will keep practicing the healthy behaviours until they're natural, keep working towards recovery, and stay kind when I slip up. This past week has shown me how worth it it is to keep going, and I know that one day, I will step out of the cycle. I will accept anxiety as a natural defensive reaction instead of a threat to get rid of.\n\nI'm still at the beginning of my healing journey, I need a lot more practice and I definitely will have more moments when HA comes back strong, but it seems I can stay hopeful. I wish that anyone feeling like they will never experience a day without HA again can maybe also find hope reading this, because there *is*, because we *can* recover, and we will.",

    "selftext": "Hello so I have been having HA for a month now. It was really bad to the point I could not even function and do everyday tasks. But thankfully I am like nearly over the HA. There is still some more to go but the progress have been really great so far so I would like to share some tips on how I managed to keep it under control and reached this far\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **DO NOT Google symptoms**\n\nI cant stress this enough. The moment I stopped Googling, my HA started to become so much better. I understand it will be very tempting to Google but trust me when I say it gets so much better once you stop Googling. One thing you must understand about Google is that they wont tell you the likelihood of you getting a disease is. So even if there is a rare symptom, websites would not usually tell you the likelihood of a normal average person getting a specific disease is less than 0.001%. Because there aim is to just give you information so they dont worry about things like likelihoods\n\n2.  **Do not let your brain take control of you**\n\nAnxiety can be annoying in that the brain takes the control of you. It over thinks scenarios and gives you the feeling of impending doom. This is because the brain is hardwired to overthink as a safety mechanism. This came on about due to our hunter ancestors from thousands of years ago trying to get away from predators and we have evolved to take that trait. Its nothing more than your brain overthinking.  But you have the ability to take back that control. Understanding this point is key to gaining control of the brain. It will be hard but once you keep the mindset that you can control it, then gradually you will soon notice you can get it under control.\n\n3. **Have a good diet and drink lots of water**\n\nWhat I have noticed from my HA is that when I got it I tend to eat and drink less than often. This resulted me in getting random headaches and body pain too. I researched a bit about this and turns out not getting enough water is a sure way of getting headaches. So I started to drink lots of water and the headaches start to subside really quickly. Same goes to eating although not much as water but having a good diet is also a great way to control your stress. You may feel you may have no appetite but even so you will need to force yourself to eat.\n\nI still noticed there are still headaches but definitely less than when I was not drinking water. Mind you this headache is related to HA. And it wont subside until you stop stressing about your health. So this is also an important point to note. Headaches are very common in people with dehydration and anxiety.\n\n4. **Preoccupy yourself with other tasks**\n\nWatch anime, movies, series or whatever you want and preoccupy yourself. Get busy. Dont give time for anxiety. Be busy for other things. Go to the gym, hang out with friends, go outside and let in the fresh air. Dont give time for the anxiety.\n\n5. **Enjoy life**\n\nWe deserve to enjoy life. Dont let things like HA give the better of you. Read the tips I mentioned above and try to not let it get to you. It takes effort and days for this to work but it will be worth it in the end. Get that mindset and hopefully you can also get rid of yourself from HA. Good luck!",

    "selftext": "When someone gets a cut on their finger, we run to the first aid kit to get a band aid & rubbing alcohol. In this scenario, we did not need to go to the hospital to get it treated. For certain situations, the same logic of first aid can be applied to mental health situations (where it can be dealt with at home and not at the hospital). Of course sometimes hospital visits do end up happening only to be told that we are fine. Here is more information of a typical action plan from [https://www.mentalhealthfirstaid.org/take-a-course/what-you-learn/](https://www.mentalhealthfirstaid.org/take-a-course/what-you-learn/)  \n\n\n**What are some methods that you have used that seem to have worked? Also if you can explain it for anyone who may be caring for a friend, sibling, guardian, child, or loved one who has HA.** \n\n**Also if you have been on the receiving end of such mental health first aid, what seems to have worked for you or which method did you like the most?**  \n\n\nThank you for sharing your tips and knowledge with us and your mental health first aid strategies directed towards people with HA. Thanks for sharing your action plans.  \n\n\nMy action plan for myself (as someone who lives alone):\n\n* Step 1. I first have to recognize that I am spiraling, and identify that it is my HA. I tell myself that I have experienced this similar feeling before, and we are going to be fine.\n* Step 2. I then shut off my wifi, turn off my phone so I can no longer consult with Dr. Google. I also hide the remote.\n* Step 3. I pull out my \"first aid kit\" which is a box full of things that will calm me down (books (Where's Waldo), teas, photo albums, notebooks, dumbbells, a puzzle, my favorite car air freshener). I try to update this box after every 2 episodes by adding new items when possible. I also add little folded pieces of paper in the box that have advice that will help me calm down (like reminders that everything will be okay). \n* Step 4. I set a timer for 45 minutes (I use the timer on my microwave to avoid my phone) and just go through the box.\n* Step 5. After 45 minutes I assess my situation and see if I need to text one of my friends. I am usually fine afterwards, but 1/10 I do text my friends. I just engage in casual conversation, and not let them know I am having a panic attack (I think because of my social anxiety, I rather not have the other person know, but everyone is different).",

    "title": "My Biggest Help for my Health Anxiety. 4 Simple Things. Run towards your anxiety.",
    "selftext": "I was just like you, I couldn't breathe due to hyperventilating, panic attacks, I couldn't drive or leave the house. I had heart paps, dizziness, nausea, and \"couldn't breathe\". And last year, I had a panic attack so bad I went to the ER. I've visited every doctor and taken many tests for my anxiety, all with no help. I've also tried therapy with no real help. These are the simple things that really helped me get to a better place, and I am definitely not 100% cured, but I definitely am able to live a more fruitful, enjoyable, and normal life.\n\n1.) The BIGGEST thing that helped my anxiety was an app. Yes, if you have an iPhone or Android, you have access to the biggest health anxiety killer, and it's the DARE app. Now, it's free but I did choose to pay a subscription for more access because it is that great of an app and I don't mind paying for something that change my perspective of anxiety and helped to rewire my brain and change my life. I recommend that if you can pay, please do because it is 1000% worth every penny, especially for health anxiety. The #1 thing he says is to see a doctor first but if you are fine, then it is anxiety and he helps you to deal with it.\n\nDo all of the challenges available and write in the journal every night before you go to sleep on the app! Turn off everything (tv, phone, tiktok, lights) and listen, and really do all he says. I promise you, whoever created this app really helps you to rewire your brain to stop running from anxiety but to run towards it. It really helped me from being in my head and calmed my stress response causing my constant panic attacks. Please, even if you don't want to pay or can't, try everything available on the app for free, it is truly a GOD sent! I could kiss the app maker if I could. This is the most important thing you can take away from this post.\n\n2.) \"Therapy In a Nutshell\"'s YouTube Channel. If you have an iPhone/Android/computer/even a Playstation, you can access this. Her channel helps to change your perspective on anxiety and again, helps to rewire your brain. I feel like her channel is a bigger library similar to the DARE app. She has so much information to help you be okay with feeling anxious and accept your physical anxiety symptoms.\n\n3.) \"Yoga with Adriene\"'s YouTube Channel. Her channel has helped me with it comes to calming my nerves when my anxiety was really bad. Do her bedtime yoga's especially, every night! Make it a routine for yourself and they help you to take 10-30 minutes to really be one with yourself. I did all the yoga in my twin sized bed, so having no space is not an excuse. Also helps you to really think about what is making you anxious, as sometimes we don't even take time in our lives to really think about why we are anxious or what we are running from. Do not JUST do yoga though, as the goal is not to just calm your nerves, but to REWIRE your anxious brain. Please do not do yoga unless you are also incorporating #1 or #2 DAILY.\n\n4.) Go to the gym, even if it's 2 times a week. I forced myself to go to the gym, even when I was hyperventilating while driving there, nervous that I would have a panic attack in front of everyone, and sometimes thinking about turning back and running back to my room, but I swear, every time I was done a gym session, I ALWAYS felt better and my anxiety would dissipate after. It helped me to realize that my heart beating hard was okay and I wasn't going to die, it showed me that I could breathe and there was nothing wrong with my lungs. Overall, it helped my health anxiety better and got me around other people. I always went at peak time. I know it's scary but trust me.\n\nI made this post because I remember how down and absolutely sad I was. Now miserable anxiety made me, and through countless anxiety attacks, not being able to drive or leave the house or work a job... I just went to the movies with my friends on Saturday and I drove all of us and I felt not one bit of anxiety and had sooo much fun. I never thought 2 years ago I would be able to say that. And with all the things I tried to help \"cure\" my anxiety, these 4 things which are so easily accessible are what helped me to get my life back. The only thing you need to do is BE CONSISTENT with it. Every night listen to these apps and channels, do your nightly yoga, and try to go to the gym. Sounds very simple but I promise the cure to anxiety is not slow breathing, meditation, or trying to calm yourself, it's **rewiring your anxious brain and running towards your anxiety**. And I am confident that these 4 things WILL help you.\n\nEven if you think this won't work, please just try all of this for one week and report back. 🥺",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone! Whoever has health anxiety because of swollen lymph nodes can talk about their experiences. Personally,  I want to know more about reactive lymph nodes and how long they stay inflamed before it goes down (if you stop fiddling with them). Make sure to support everyone and give useful advice, I do have some myself:\n\n1: Stop poking and prodding on your lymph nodes, the more you touch them, the longer they will stay inflamed/swollen. I’ve read posts that say that their reactive lymph nodes took anywhere from 5 to 14 months to go down! Maybe permanent in some circumstances!\n\n2: If you checked in with a doctor and made sure it’s nothing serious, try to forget about it. I know, It may seem hard, but try to do something interesting, learn a new sport, language, or instrument. Try to resume your daily habits and routines if your behavior has changed a lot from anxiety. It can increase your chances of forgetting your lymph nodes, especially if you have no symptoms. Ive had someone comment on my other post and said that school distracted her and she forgot about her lymph nodes, and they went down!\n\n3: Delete Google or any app you search your symptoms on. Searching your symptoms will make it worse, searching wont benefit you in any way. Your looking at a bunch of pixels on a screen! The real help comes from a doctor. So if you aren’t in touch with one, I highly recommend you do.   \n\n\n4th and final: Believe In yourself. Several studies show that worrying will worsen the swelling of your lymph nodes. Don’t worry, and believe that there is nothing wrong with your body, even If something is actually wrong. Mental health is just as important as mental health. Still, it is important to check in with your doctor, I don’t want to misinform anyone. \n\nAnd that’s it, wishing everyone here the best of luck, for both their mental and physical health. Peace!",

    "selftext": "These statistics are from my doctor and reliable sources:\n\nLess than 1.1% of patients with swollen lymph nodes have Lymphoma, making it super unlikely.   \nOnly 50,000 people in the US per year are diagnosed with any type of lymphoma. Compared to the total population, that’s only 0.015%. Then add the survival rates, the average survival rate for lymphoma in general is 85-90% it is one of the most treatable cancers. This makes the percentage go down to 0.0015! That’s only about 1 out of every 100,000 people!\n\nSo don’t be worried about having lymphoma unless you have SEVERE symptoms that last more than 2 weeks. Calm down, everything’s gonna be okay. Take deep breaths, close your eyes and imagine where you want to go the most. Have a great day!",

My dad won't allow my mom to go anywhere except with him to the grocery store.  He does make one exception that she can go to the hairdresser alone only because he trusts the hairstylist's covid precautions. \n\nHe is obsessed with nutrition and health, pretty much all he ever wants to talk about. But his paranoia over covid just seems way over the top.  It is not fair to control my mom as he does.  My mom is a social person while my dad has always been an introvert who is also on the spectrum.  \n\nWeekly I get texts from my mom complaining about how horrible my dad is being.  I wish I could tell her to stop involving me, but I am all she basically has. Now my dad is not allowing me to come over because he thinks I don't care about covid safety enough.  I literally am a hermit.  I work from home and barely ever leave.  I took my dog to the groomer on Wednesday and because of that, my dad won't allow me to come over because I wore a cloth mask and not a KN95.\n\nAnyways, my dad refuses to get therapy.  He has tried and it just hasn't worked for him.  So my question is how do I deal with this obsession he has?  I work for him unfortunately so I cannot detach with love from him.  Our interactions though have become less and less due to calling him out on his controlling behavior which he does not like.",

    "selftext": "DO NOT WORRY. Acid reflux is a mechanical disorder when your LES lets food and acid go back up your stomach. It isn’t that serious, even if the symptoms are bad. I’ve had GERD for 3 years now, and is going pretty well even after going untreated for 2 YEARS (I didn’t know what it was till least year). As long as you are changing your diet and taking doctor prescribed medication, you’ll be okay.   \n\n\nFor those who are worried about Barrett’s Esophagus or even Esophageal Cancer and have mild or moderate symptoms, don’t even think about it. Check this out, only 20% of acid reflux patients have GERD, and only 10% of patients with GERD have Barrett’s Esophagus. And the GERD patients who had Barrett’s esophagus were mostly untreated for 5 YEARS! EVEN if you have Barretts’ esophagus, you'll only have less than a 3% chance of having esophageal cancer.  Esophageal cancer is a hell of a rare disease you have to go untreated for over 15 years to get it, and the younger you are, the chances really drop down. So unless you’re a 80 year old with 20 years of untreated GERD, you pretty much have nothing to worry about Esophageal Cancer. (No offence)  \n\n\nStill worried? Esophageal cancer is HORRIBLE. You almost can’t eat, you vomit blood. You feel sick, even worse than a fever, you can’t stand up properly, you have trouble swallowing. Loss of appetite, searing pain every time you swallow. And much more horrible symptoms.   \n\n\nWhat Im saying is, whatever symptoms you have, will come nothing close to that. Don’t think you have Esopageal cancer, that thing rocks your body to the CORE. Go enjoy your day, stop fussing around because of a buncha thoughts. Have a good day, stay safe and healthy!😘😃",

    "selftext": "If you have anxiety over one or more swollen lymph nodes, then you’ve come to the right place. I have swollen lymph nodes about 1-2 cm all over my body with no symptoms, (for 1 year now) and everything proved to be okay. My doctor said It was just reactive or shoty lymph nodes. I had an ultrasound and the doc said it’s nothing to worry about, and they were not cancerous.  It was probably due to some minor infections or vaccine shots, and the lymph nodes just never went down. Swollen lymph nodes are normal (even after years), they are just your body’s sewer system working optimally. Now onto fears about you having LYMPHOMA.\n\nI feel like lots of you are underestimating this cancer. Lymphoma is HORRIBLE, and how doctors describe it are COMPLETELY different than what Dr. GOOGLE says it is. Lymphoma lymph nodes are huge, you feel like there are grapes growing inside you, they can even get as big as a GOLF BALL. At night, you sweat as if you just got out of a POOL. You have to change your sheets EVERY night. The itching, well, it feels like you’ve got bug stings ALL over your body, it is unbearable. Lymphoma nodes never hide, they get an inch bigger every few weeks! Not to mention the fevers, it feels like you have a horrible fever that NEVER stops, getting worse as the days go by.\n\nSo my point is, stop worrying about those puny mm or cm large lymph nodes, they are most likely nothing. However I not telling you to just ignore your swollen lymph nodes, you should still get checked up. I’m just saying that your lymph nodes, are likely NOTHING serious. So just relax, if your symptoms are not like this. Go listen to some music, take a walk outside. Thanks for reading!\n\nEdit: wow, this post helped a lot of people, I’m glad I can do something and contribute usefully to this world for once!",

However, ever since I was 13, I've been experiencing death a lot. It started with my grandpa, then a cousin, my mom, a friend, another cousin, a neighbor, and recently an uncle. Two of my relatives have been diagnosed with cancer a few years ago. All of the causes for these deaths could've been either avoided, or treated. Some of these people I was close with, others I wasn't - but even with those I wasn't, I still couldn't help but dread over their death. \n\nIt's very obvious to me that this trauma is the root of my HA. And on top of that - I don't know if it can be genetic, or if it's just human nature - it runs in the family. Very commonly so.\n\nMy health anxiety began in 2016, but it only concerned others. In 2019 it evolved into not only others, but me as well. Late 2020 I had a breakdown and I haven't been the same. I wake up checking if my dog is still breathing, if my dad is okay, and if my symptoms worsened overnight. I am body checking as I write. It's debilitating.\n\nNo matter what caused your HA, we are here for you and you have never been alone, this terrible condition of the mind has been around longer than we can imagine and can affect even the most iron-willed person. We're so strong for enduring this. And if we know the roots - which can be anything, it doesn't have to be loss related - we're a step closer to living a better life.",

I was having intrusive thoughts about how it would be hard for my family to cope with another diagnosis.\n\nThe health anxiety progressed and I learned about neurological diseases from Google when I started twitching. This is where things hit the lowest point. I begged doctors for the tests and paid privately- the nhs would have never allowed these tests. I didn’t think I would see this future I’m living now.\n\nThings got better when I saw this amazing neurologist who told me he was 100% my symptoms were due to stress not a scary three letter word.\n\nThis reassurance from probably the smartest person I met gave me enough will power to get better. \n\nI moved house to live by the sea and did 4 months of talking therapy and 2 months of CBT. Getting better was a slow progress, the less I bought into health anxiety the better I got. I finished CBT over a month ago and we discussed what would make me relapse, I said another family illness or a health scare myself.\n\nWell cue a month later (two weeks ago from now) my partners mum who I know well got told she had cancer. It seemed to happen so suddenly. When my partner went to work I had a meltdown, how was I supposed to help him. The whole situation had made me so anxious and afraid. A week later his Nan got ill and I had to go to hospital with him - so scary for someone with health anxiety. And a couple days later my dad got rushed into hospital. My mum didn’t tell me what was going on until he got the all clear to go home. \n\nA year ago these situations would have crippled me, but I’m learning to sit with the uncertainty. Overthinking is bad for me and I’ve been able to keep functioning and not relapse despite this incredibly challenging and scary situation. \n\nThe next few weeks are going to be hard but I know I can deal with this and not let the health anxiety win.",

    "selftext": "As many on this sub know a replaps back to constant panic after improvements is always a possibility. But I thought I'd take this opportunity to hopefully help others as I will myself back to recovery. \n\nFor me everything is heart related fears and a touch of heartburn can set me on a spiral. Well thats what happened, a pain in my chest and all my therapy goes out the window and I'm full panic mode. But I am confident I can get back to baseline.\n\nStep one, Recognise what's happening.   \nAt my first point of panic I start thinking logically, mentally listing all the reasons I am wrong to panic, I force myself to think about how healthy I am and every worry gets a 'counterpoint'. My panic continued but I ignored the pain and kept telling myself \"this is just panic your feeling anxiety\". I literally pointed at my chest and said to myself \"pain is anxiety\". \n\nStep two, Don't alter behavior.   \nOne of the biggest tools to fight my anxiety is my routine. this particular attack happened when I was arriving at work one morning. Normally I grab a coffee and head to my desk, but with this new panic attack and health worry I wanted to skip the coffee and go straight to my desk. But I Didn't. Anxieties feed on altering behavior, when I've changed my behavior it is signaling to my subconscious that the worry is bad enough that I needed to change from my normal routine. Now - don't get me wrong, the cafe was loud and I was uncomfortable with my heart racing with panic, but i forced myself to order what i normally order wait where I normally wait and do what I normally do. Funnily enough the moment I was handed my coffee by the regular burresta I started to feel a little better, because 'why would I be ordering coffee if something was wrong'.\n\nStep three, attacks are like earthquakes.   \nEvery time I have a panic attack I have follow up pains and attacks for weeks after, like the aftershocks of an earthquake. Each one have the potential to cause another meltdown, but I try my best to push through I call the anxiety what it is \"an aftershock\" and let it wash over me.\n\nStep four, investigate.   \nwhenever I back slide with my HA. I always find two factors at play, a trigger and a weakened mental state. The triggers are easy to identify because they generally are right before the breakdown and revolve around the particular anxiety we all feel. But the weakener is the thing that made this trigger the one to break through. Why was I more susceptible today, why was my mind not able to fight off this trigger like every other day.\n\nI think for me, I hadn't been sleeping well and I've been a bit sad because my pet had died this week. I've been staying up late and working a lot. I'm gonna' focus on getting some early nights and schedule myself some personal time for self care. I've also booked in some time with my friends who have all been too busy to catch up recently. \n\nI am sure I'll be back to 100% soon and hopefully my little story can show what living with HA is like on the other side of treatment. I brake down, I get back up I feel better and get back too my life.",

I'm fortunate that the physical symptoms are no more than a minor irritation other than the fear of what they could progress to.

    "selftext": "TW: thoughts of cancer \n\nHey guys, I just wanted to give everyone a little bit of hope that health anxiety can get better. I’m not out of the woods yet at all but I’ve been seeing a therapist and doing CBT. I’ve been using the app FreeCBT, which I highly recommend because it gives me a place to write down my anxious thoughts and come up with an alternative to focus on.\n\nI have had a mole on my leg that I’ve hyper fixated on for probably the last 2.5 years. I’ve had it checked twice, the second time it was even biopsied and came back clear of anything. Even with all that, I started to panic about it two weeks ago. I noticed it when I was anxious and was convinced it had changed and was cancerous. \n\nI couldn’t find any before photos to compare so I spiralled and assumed it was of course going to be skin cancer. I told myself I would wait a week to go to the doctor and try to get my anxiety a bit calmed down in the mean time. I knew I couldn’t trust my eyes and that it was highly likely it hadn’t actually changed. \n\nUsing the CBT app and some techniques I’ve learned in therapy, like refraining from seeking reassurance, I started to go from convinced it was terminal skin cancer and I was already dead to accepting that it might have changed but that doesn’t mean my worst case scenario is true.\n\nToday I found a pic from 6 months ago and of course the mole hasn’t changed from then. \n\nSo, all this to say that I found these techniques super helpful and having some boundaries in place about when to seek reassurance from a doctor helped me from racing to the GP to immediately  calm my anxiety. \n\nHope this helps someone else! Remember, we aren’t lost causes with health anxiety, we just need the right tools to manage it.",

    "selftext": "Hi! I am new to Reddit and joined for this thread but I wanted to share my story in case anyone else was experiencing a similar thing. \nLong story short I got attacked by a dog and was in the ER and super sick for a while, was put on tons of antibiotics to stave off infection which wrecked my gut and ultimately is what I believe led to the severe health anxiety I experience today (compounded with some other unrelated trauma)\nA few months later after an extremely challenging college semester I had a break down one night and had my first panic attack, got prescribed lexapro, ended up being allergic to it and sent back to the ER which led to 3 weeks of pure hell/ panic attacks resulting in me having to go home for a while. \n(do not let this worry you, doc said I was a lucky 1/40000 haha and I was fine!)\nI am now back on campus after some of the most difficult weeks of my life and am experiencing another panic flair up because I caught a BRUTAL stomach bug which had me throwing up every hour for 8 hours on the floor begging for mercy. \nNow that my anxiety symptoms have come back in their ugly full fledged form I wanted to share a first person POV of how it feels to struggle with severe anxiety to see if it helps anyone else feel less alone (and safe, as I have had multiple eeg/ MRI/ blood work scans done with the ultimate problem being that I am just nervous and not eating enough haha)\n- weak legs/ arms/ constant exhaustion \n-frequent or constant pounding heart \n-weakened immune system \n- racing mind, entire body filled with white hot adrenaline and fear to the point where I feel like I need to run 40 miles but cannot move at the same time\n- heart palpitations\n-headaches \n-loss of appetite \n-random chest / body aches /pains (dull, stabbing, you name it.. seems to conveniently resemble every scary health condition on WEB md)\n-constant fear and/or panic \n-feeling upset that everyone else seems to complete “normal activities” with ease \n-not believing I’ll live longer than tomorrow / impending sense of doom \n-exhaustion/ fatigue \n-jaw / tooth pain / clenched teeth/ dry mouth \n-nausea, dizziness, flushed face / hot to touch \n-need to cry but too tired to \n-stomach aches/ diarrhea \n-feeling faint / passing out\n-dehydrated \n-muscle cramps \n-tinnitus \n-brain zaps\n-missed / skipped heart beats that wake up me at night \n-feeling unnaturally hot/ cold \n-blotchy skin \n-head pressure \n-racing heart \n-Random leg/ arm/ neck / shoulder pains\n-hyper aware of heart beat\n-exhausted but wired at the same time \n\nThe list goes on and on. Basically, what I want to say is that anxiety can manifest itself in some NASTY ways, and that if you don’t listen to your body when it says it has had enough then it will make you listen. So far, what has worked for me is trying to eliminate sugar, cutting out caffeine / Alc completely, headspace meditation app, walking every day, yoga, Xanax for emergencies ,magnesium supplements (for heart)& therapy, but most importantly EATING 3 MEALS A DAY & staying GLUED to my water bottle (as well as a solid day / nighttime routine (blue light glasses & lavender oil, no eating after 7) - works wonders)\n\n(I know that medication works for some but that is one of my triggers so I declined it )\n\nThere is a HUGE connection between gut health / nutrients/ mental health and the smallest thing like not eating enough/ an unbalanced diet has the potential to bring on an array of terrible symptoms that I , like many of us in this thread, will mistakenly attribute to fatal diseases/ conditions. So my advice when you’re feeling out of control is to remember that you have been here before and that no matter how much it doesn’t feel like it your body loves you and is doing it’s best to keep you alive happy and safe. So trust it, acknowledge the fear and let it run over you so you prove to yourself that this is something you can and will overcome. \n\nI wanted to say I am proud of every single being that deals with anxiety of any form and that you are incredibly strong, resilient , and capable no matter how exhausted you feel. You wake up every day and experience terrifying experiences  some won’t ever know in their lifetime- and therefore, you deserve all of the self grace and love in the world. Sending my love to everyone in here and staying confident that there is light at the end of this seemingly never ending tunnel. \n\nEdit: it’s a constant struggle & fluctuation is completely normal. every day is a battle but I know that some days will be rougher than others and so I recommend that all of you treat yourself with the same respect and love that you undoubtedly treat others with <3 talk to yourself like you’re talking to a friend or loved one and know that it’s okay to have off days! \n\nTLDR; anxiety can manifest itself in almost any nasty way possible, make sure you eat right & drink water & STOP GOOGLING your health concerns",

And that this will happen most likely in the very elderly people..etc. Instead they say words like \"It can cause death\", \"Sometimes it can cause death\"\n\nNot only for symptoms, even for rare diseases sometimes they wont say that its a rare disease. And this can make people really scared\n\nI think that is the real problem of the HA triggers. People seeing this would think that this is not rare at all and that it could happen to them too, and this ultimately would trigger their health anxiety. I believe health websites should not scare people like this without properly explaining things. They should mention healthy people should not be worried. \n\nWhat do you guys think?",

    "selftext": "First off, I don’t claim to have all the answers and I can only really tell you what works for me. And I’m still not perfect but I’m not constantly afraid of sudden death by heart attack or stroke or whatever like I used to be. \n\nI used to be scared shitless that I would die during my sleep and would dwell on the thought of my parents finding my body. So I stayed up pretty late and had a hard time sleeping. I remember feeling scared that one day no one would take me seriously anymore and think I’m crazy.\n\nFirst and foremost, I’d recommend talking to your doctor about how you feel. They know more than you when it comes to your body’s health. Trust them and accept that you won’t just change overnight. I’ve had 3 panic attacks that made me go to the ER which of course they confirmed that everything was fine. It’s easy to brush off the words of friends or family. It’s tougher to hand wave the words of a medical professional. Just be upfront with them even if what you’re thinking sounds stupid as hell. Don’t be afraid of any kind of therapy. \n\nAlso, if your smoking weed (like I was) then stop. If it’s helping you and not making you more anxious or paranoid then keep at it. It just made me more paranoid. Cutting out weed really helped me after a month or two but was rough at the start of me quitting. Stop doomscrolling and reading negative shit online. Stop worrying about climate change or the end of civilization. Start focusing on what’s really in front of you and what’s happening in your own life. \n\nDaily exercise is also a VERY GOOD idea. You need those endorphins and you’ll feel good knowing you’re at least making an effort to improve your well being. Go outside for a walk if you feel like the walls are closing in on you. Run on a treadmill if you’ve got access to one. Lift weights until you can’t anymore even if you’re not gonna get shredded and even if you’re only doing it for one muscle group. \n\nKeep water with you at all times and wherever you go. It’s the best drink for you and if you keep it on hand and prevent yourself from getting super thirsty then you’ll be less likely to go “I’m thirsty, let’s go get a Pepsi” or whatever. This will also make you feel a bit better about yourself and it’s one of the best things you can do is drink water throughout the day.\n\nDo yoga and/or meditation. You don’t have to do all of these things btw. This is just me throwing out a bunch of shit that’s good for you. I don’t even do yoga or meditate but it’s still good for you. Understand that you can’t see the future, chaining negative thought with another negative thought in an endless cycle is a waste of time. You’re not mentally preparing yourself for a disaster you’re just torturing yourself. I used to listen to lots of Alan Watts. It didn’t always make sense or always reveal some incredible truth but it felt positive and helped keep me in a more positive mindset.\n\nDon’t push your friends away. Good friends will want to help even if that means just being able to hang out with you. Don’t lose your friends.",

Not sure who needs to hear this…but I’ve struggled with health anxiety for about 7 years and was under the impression that there weren’t any strategies I could employ to help myself feel better. I’d just have to wait until life calmed down (yes, a therapist told me this). \n\nFast forward to last summer - I was diagnosed with OCD. I have since become convinced that health anxiety is just another form of OCD. I do believe it is possible to only have obsessions with and compulsions related to health, but I also get the sense that many people who have obsessions about health also obsess/compulse about other things. Something that I didn’t know before starting therapy specifically for OCD/health anxiety is that compulsions can be mental, too (for example, constantly reassuring yourself that you don’t actually have cancer, which is actually counterproductive and makes the anxiety worse)! \n\nExposure Response Prevention (the gold standard OCD treatment) has worked SO well for my health anxiety. I now have tools and strategies to implement when I experience an intrusive thought or sensation related to my health, and I haven’t googled for weeks, maybe even months. \n\nTwo insta accounts I’ve learned A LOT from are @ocdexcellence and @NOCD.

And I do not know if it's real sadness!  I've had these feelings before in the past, and one time I went to a psychologist thinking I was (getting) depressed. She said I was not depressed. and that was it. \n\nBut here is the thing. I just function normally, and when I look up symptoms of depression, I don't have them, except for the sadness part. Yes I feel sad, but not about anything particular, just a feeling. It's more like I feel sad for no reason, then I convince myself I must be unhappy with my life, or some other day I will convince myself I am very lonely, and so on...\n\nSometimes I convince myself that I am depressed and start to look up ways to cure depression, but sometime later I find myself scanning my body and fearing there is sadness inside of me, which I always find if I scan for it.\n\nEspecially when I am \"supposed\" to have a good time (for example , seeing friends, playing games, listening to uplifting music) I am very aware of the \"sadness\" feeling inside of me. Probably because I think if I am not enjoying myself at these times, I must be depressed. And I am afraid these feelings of joy are fake. I can be laughing and feeling sad at the same time :S\n\nIf I just knew these feelings/thought are a normal sign of health anxiety (or even if this is some weird  symptoms of a weird form of depression), I would probably feel a lot better. Because it seems like I am the only one who has this.\n\nPlease advise.\n\nThank you very much.",

    "selftext": "I've been dealing with serious HA for about a year. While I'm still battling this beast almost daily I wanted to share some of the things that worked for me and what didn't. Also I thought it might be cathartic for me document my experiences.\n\nPossible triggers: ❤️ & 🧠 anxiety. \n\nMy first panic attack lead me too the hospital in Feb of 2021. This would be the start of HA. My thought was I was having a heart attack. I'm sure that resonates with many of you. Unfortunately for me the word panic or anxiety wasn't brought up until days after my release. All the hospital gave me was a diagnosis of 'heart palpitations.\"\n\nAt the time I was living alone mid pandemic in a large city in the US. Something that I wasn't particularly happy about but I never minded it until I was released. I became terrified of being alone. Staying with relatives as much as I could I started to feel like I was becoming a burden. A fully grown and independent man now feeling like a child.\n\nWhat I didn't realize is how wrong that mindset was and how much this was the beginning of me connecting with my friends and loved ones more then I have in years.\n\nMy first tip being an obvious one: Let the people around you help you in anyway they can. You have no idea how much stronger my bonds are now with those who helped me.\n\nAbout a month of what I would now assume was agoraphobia I was able to return to home (shout out to my wonderful cat for making sure I always at least stopped back at home daily.) I was still terrified of having a heart attack. Still experiencing the same pains. It was around this time I started reading a book titled DARE and began therapy.\n\nThis is my second tip. Between this book and therapy it gave me the tools I felt I needed to swing back at the HA. A few months of this did me wonders and gave me some normal days finally. \n\nAs I learned in the book however. Set backs are a thing and they fucking suck. At the point of me writing this I have quite a few.\n\nI eventually moved from my home state in the US to another I have family in because of one of these set backs. I thought a new environment and new career might help. As well as a new overall health regime.\n\nMy third tip. Get yourself active. Get yourself moving. Eat a little better. Drink more water. While I personally didn't see too many results from these I was atleast able to tell myself doing all of these reduces my risk of what I fear. I however don't recommend uprooting as I did. It really just made everything worse. Even thought I moved from a temperate climate to the sunshine state.\n\nA few months into my new environment one of my coworkers unfortunately experienced a stroke. (He is okay!) And ever since my second horseman rode in. I was fearing having a stroke like it was going out of style. Accompanied with strange sensations in my right arm and leg. As well as a headache on my right side that has seemingly lasted since December. Add into that mix a little unending sense of derealization and I was right back into what I felt was the same levels of anxiety I had in the past.\n\nI attempted to try medication around this time by seeing a psychologist. Unfortunately not good results there and the SSRI I was prescribed made me feel awful. Probably the highest levels of HA I've experienced were when I was on it. I only lasted a few days. I am really scared to try another one. \n\nSide note: I saw a GP once and went to a few doctors when I had my apparent heart issues. Once the results came back it was has hard to believe that there was nothing wrong with me. But it was a bullet in my arsenal of tools. It ultimately gave me the confidence I needed to carry on. I however have not been one for this apparent incoming stroke. Should I have by now? Probably. Part of me is too stubborn I think. \n\nThis pretty much leads me to the past few weeks. I am stull terrified of a stroke. However the heart attack fear is mostly gone. So thats a win. The past few days in particular have been real bad. I googled some shit I shouldn't have as well and that caused me to spiral. Something I know I shouldn't do and neither should you! \n\n\nTLDR before this gets any longer.\n\n\n-Family and friends are an amazing source of help. You may even find yourself binding with them more.\n\n-Find a therapist ASAP and try something like the DARE book. These were so helpful!\n\n-You don't have to become a health nut but just take care of yourself a little better.\n\n-Dr. Google should have their PhD revoked.\n\n-Experiencing and sitting with fear is an amazing way to conquer that fear. You need to be patient and have an accepting mindset. The only way out is through.\n\n-Set backs will happen. Possibly from a new sensation or fear. This doesn't mean all your hard work has gone towards nothing. If you have felt that normalcy once, you can again.\n\n-Please see the best doctor you can. Find one compassionate and understanding. If you need a second opinion do it. \n\nThanks for reading my journey so far. If you read if all I hope I did not waste your time. Hopefully this can help atleast one person even just for a moment. I'm still here fighting this like all of you. \n\nFeel free to drop a DM too! I would love to talk with anyone dealing with this awful burden.",

But it honestly was the best decision I’ve ever made. The difference was almost immediate but when I hit that two month mark my world changed and I felt NORMAL again. The initial side effects from starting the drug was not very intense and even when they would act up I found a lot of comfort in knowing the exact reason those things were happening. \n\nAs far as the DARE app, it’s a method of dealing with anxiety and panic disorder that involves some steps. Diffuse, Accept, Run toward, and engage. It’s also a lot of CBT-esque work like trusting your body to take care of itself and learning to sit with uncomfortable feelings while knowing they are not a threat.",

Around the start of this year, my health anxiety was through the roof, and I mean it. To the point I got worried that my stretch marks were hurting, I was full on panicking about something that went away after a week. I was cautious about every little mole, every pain, every itch and every single-thing on my body. Ive been convinced I’ve had pretty much every single cancer and a ton of illnesses only in the time frame of 3 months. My OCD played a big part in it too, it was always telling me to do this or that or I have whatever illness im worried about. It’s now mid april and I haven’t thought about illnesses or googled my symptoms for the whole month:) OCD and depression are still there, but god am I thankful health anxiety is way better. Obviously I still panic sometimes but its so much rarer now and i’m so thankful.\n\nSomething that helped me personally a lot was comparing the likeliness of me having this or that illness. When I get scared about breast cancer for example, I remind myself I am literally a teenage girl and theres a higher chance I could win the lottery than have breast cancer. Another thing is distractions. A lot of distractions. Whenever you feel yourself spiralling down the rabbit hole of googling, immediately start doing something. Watch a movie, listen to music, call a friend, draw something. Just occupy your mind.\n\nI won’t be active on here anymore since im better now, but i hope everyone who is struggling with HA gets better too:)",

I just didn't feel good about disappearing and letting the sub die without one last message.\n\nYou've given a ton of feedback and encouragement through that thread. Thankfully, as a result of the post, a number of users have thrown their hat in to join the mod team. \n\nIf you've offered to help, but haven't yet heard back, [shoot us a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/HealthAnxiety). We're vetting potential mods at the moment, as well as starting the early stages of training. \n\nThat is to say, we have a general plan, but it's still forming. Here are the details of what's next:\n\n1. r/HealthAnxiety will not be closing. (or at least, not as soon as expected).\n2. We will still be designing the rules and projects on r/HealthAnxiety to avoid nurturing reassurance loops. We will also be more aggressive about creating a space that realizes this goal. There will be a lot of active changes in the coming weeks to how the sub looks and runs.\n3. We will still be running the daily stickied threads for reassurance, and they will be supported more actively by our team. \n4. We'll be providing more resources for our users to browse. We will also be looking for examples of posts that you found really helpful/inspiring, so feel free to nominate below!\n5. In the event that the sub falls apart again, I will take all of your feedback into consideration, and leave it in a state where you can still search and browse old posts.\n\nUltimately, the goal will be to create a vibrant, compassionate space that allows for users to experience their tough times together, while also ensuring that we're not creating an echo chamber of spiraling fear.\n\nSo, now, we've got a ton of volunteers jumping on the team, so we're hoping that this will mean that r/HealthAnxiety can stick around much longer, even if some of us burn out 😅. \n\nAs for me: For the sake of training and genuine care for the community, I will be sticking around to transition things and provide guidance. After that, I'm hoping to exist in a supportive role that doesn't hold the new team back from implementing their vision here. I'm also hoping to build a connection with subs like r/OCD, r/Anxiety, and similar, because they've got some incredible, supportive teams, and there's no sense staying apart when we can learn so much from each other.\n\n\n**Feel free to express concerns, ask questions, or provide suggestions in the comments below.**",

    "selftext": "I’d like to share some help that I found after suffering from such severe health anxiety that I couldn’t differentiate from reality and anxiety anymore. \n\n1. When you Google symptoms, Google it in positive or neutral terms. For example: when your leg feels funny, instead of “blood clot symptoms”, Google “leg is tingly after sleeping”. You will learn actual medical reasonings for your issue instead of scaring yourself because you just don’t understand. It isn’t easy to just stop Googling things like everyone suggests, so frame it in more positive terms. \n\n2. Think before you Google. I’m not saying don’t Google symptoms because sometimes you genuinely can’t help it. But for 5 seconds before, just remind yourself of your day. Did you sleep poorly? Did you drink enough water? Did you only eat snacks instead of meals? Did you go to lunch with someone with a cold? Have you been sitting on the same leg for hours at your computer? Really think about your day before you Google, and remind yourself that every single symptom you’re experiencing is more than likely caused by one of these factors. \n\n3. Require your brain to assume the most minuscule reason instead of the worst case scenario. This one is hard because you are actually rewiring your brain. Instead of thinking “my lymph nodes are swollen so I must have Hodgkins Lymphoma”, think “my lymph nodes are swollen because it’s allergy season and my body hates the pollen so it’s fighting it off for me.” The majority of the time, the most basic reason IS the reason. \n\n4. Stop combining past/current symptoms to make “proof”. Our bodies react constantly to stimuli that we don’t even notice (because it’s fighting it for us). You may have multiple symptoms at the same time, but they usually aren’t related. Your DOCTOR will tell you if they are, but don’t automatically assume that they aren’t. They usually aren’t. \n\nI’m sure I have more and I will add them as I think of them. I suffered so terribly and my only solace was Lexapro helping me to stop spiraling so I could actually work on my thought patterns. Remember, there is nothing wrong with us. We just pay attention to our bodies more than others.",

Allergy season have also been kicking my butt that past couple of weeks and I have had fatigue, headaches, asthma flares, and even though I know that I experience these symptoms every year at allergy season, it’s gotta be lymphoma🙄 And finally last night I must have eaten something bad because I was sick all night with diarrhea and nausea and still feel a little off today. Separately, I know what each of these symptoms are coming from, but when I look at them all together I’m like “oh these are all symptoms of x cancer or x disease”. \n\nMy question is, how do I convince myself that these symptoms are common symptoms of common things and not lump them all together as being part of some scary problem?

Countless doctors visits and reassurance from friends, nothing seemed to help comfort me. I always thought \"how could I possibly handle actually being diagnosed with something if I'm this anxious just from the thought of it?\".\n\nHowever, a few weeks ago I was diagnosed with a moderately serious illness and I just wanted to say, things are really not that bad. \n\nFirstly, facing your fears is honestly liberating in some ways. I have anxious moments and panic but it has been freeing as well.\n\n Secondly, doctors and medicine are super advanced. The machines, treatments, and knowledge they have is very impressive. Health anxiety can feel so overwhelming and make you feel powerless, but even in the less ideal scenario of being diagnosed with something, there are teams of experts who spend their whole careers helping people with those illnesses. \n\nThirdly, I know that many people's health anxiety flares up as a coping mechanism for other stress. Mine is the same. But using mindfulness, reducing my seeking reassurance, and trusting that if something needs a doctor's attention, your body will tell you, have really helped me. In fact, so many of my HA symptoms were very real but very vague bodily sensations and racing thoughts. But when something genuine happened leading to this diagnosis, I knew to see someone. I didn't have to seek reassurance because my body told me that I should chat to a doctor. \n\nAll this to say, things are not as scary as your mind is telling you they are and your health anxiety is lying to you. Your body and mind are a lot stronger than you're giving them credit for and unexpected plans are truly, honestly not as earth-shattering as they seem to be.",

    "selftext": "There is no quick fix for health anxiety and every person suffering from it probably needs a different approach when trying to control it. However, I discovered a thought which really helped me and therefore I decided to share it with you. We are all concerned about our health, that’s something we have in common. We have different triggers, different thoughts about different illnesses, but in the end we all worry about our health. And guess what, worrying is very unhealthy, those stressful thoughts increase cortisol levels and not getting enough sleep makes it even worse. I found some significant motivation in this. We are never 100% sure about the suspected illnesses we worry about. But we know for certain that the worrying is bad for our health. So it isn’t about not caring about your health, you should actually care a lot about your health and therefore you should not worry! Act on real symptoms and try to stay calm for the sake of your health. I wish you all the best and feel free to respond with advice and thoughts of your own :)",

For me personally the HA I had was focused on my heart (heart attack) and more recently, stroke / blood clot.

They sent me to a dental pain specialist who suspected “myofascial pain” which is basically a catch-all for dental pain with no known cause. I was in a lot of pain and wanted to know exactly what this was —  trigemunal neuralgia? TMJ? Something else? The specialist wasn’t certain and said it was “probably” either nerve-related or dental-related. \n\nHe has been giving me physiotherapy for this mystery condition on and off for the past ten months. In this time the pain has alternately increased and slightly decreased (repeat repeat repeat), and pain has developed in new teeth as well. I asked him to look at the other teeth but he won’t because it’s not his specialty. I’ve been back back to my regular dentist several times and they always say the x-rays “seem” ok, but that it’s never possible to know for sure (!!).  \n\nI’m so discouraged and beaten down by ten months of this. Every day, each twinge of pain sends me down a rabbit hole of anxiety, and both the specialist and the dentist can only give me comments like “maybe” and “not sure” and “seems ok”.\n\nI know that acceptance is a big part of dealing with health anxiety, but I feel completely trapped and tortured in this situation because I can never seem to get a clear diagnosis. I’m also terrified that my teeth may be sustaining catastrophic damage that is not being properly addressed.\n\nIf any of you have had a similar experience (doesn’t have to be dental), please, I beg of you: how do you get through one day to the next?

In my 30's my HA seemed to get worse, I obsessed about every bodily sensation and drove myself mad with worst case scenario outcomes which I dreamt up in my head. I was also a regular visitor to my doctors, to the point every member off staff knew me by first name. I am telling you this because I was what you might call a severe case. However, over the past few years I decided I had to change, I had to get better, I had to beat my irrational fears and I started by doing one thing and that one thing was this, I did the opposite of what my cataclysmic mind was telling me. An example is this, \\*TRIGGER WARNING. \\* If say I was obsessing that I had an undiagnosed heart/lung condition I forced myself to challenge that idea. I didn't mentally challenge myself I did so physically. In the before mentioned example I would go for a run or workout. During the run etc id admittedly be almost a point of panic because I was sure something awful was about to happen but I used my fear as fuel to push on. I did this (Almost) every single day for months, and yes I still have fears now but I use this \"Technique\" to give myself some sort of reassurance instead of seeking it from others or from other sources. Start small and do the opposite of what you are worried about. \\*Trigger warning\\* If you are worried you have a rare form of cancer think to yourself these things, What can't someone who's dying of cancer do?

    "selftext": "Hello everyone. Quick little intro to start off. On October 5th 2021, I [22M] was smoking weed and eating snacks when all of a sudden I had a giant panic attack, something I’ve never had in my whole life. The next morning I woke up sweating with my heart beating fast and went to the er. Everything was fine apparently, but ever since then I’ve had nothing but health anxiety/hypochondria. My chest hurts on a daily/every other day basis, I’m constantly worrying I’ll have a heart attack/stroke/etc. I’ve been just dealing with it, going to doctors appointments to be told I was fine when I don’t feel fine. After some recent blood work, I’ve reached a turning point I think. Here’s what happened.\n\nTurns out, my good cholesterol is quite low (33), and my bad cholesterol is quite high (211). I’m very out of shape and have been eating like shit for a while now. I was in great shape before and during basic training, but ever since Covid I’ve just kind of lost it, gained weight, stopped exercising, ate like shit, and smoke a lot of weed. However, hearing about my cholesterol made me start trying to fix myself once again, as years ago I was very unhealthy as well. For the past week I’ve been eating healthy, and finally started to go for runs again just last night. \n\nI haven’t stopped worrying nor do I feel better physically (still have chest pains) but I feel like this might be the way to go about this, to maybe start feeling like how I used to before October, when I wasn’t paranoid 24/7. Can anyone relate to what I’m going through, and the steps I’m taking to perhaps fix it? Any information or similar stories would be very much appreciated. Thank you and have a nice night :)\n\n\nTLDR: started having really bad anxiety/hypochondria for the first time ever last October after smoking weed and being very unhealthy. After finding out about my cholesterol being bad I used that as my reason to start eating healthy and exercising once more to maybe end the paranoia after doctors told me I’m fine health wise (heart disease, diabetes, etc.).

Recruiting and training takes time, and for it to be almost entirely fruitless is discouraging. \n\nIt seems, no matter how many rules we set out, we get hundreds of submissions per-day that break down as-such:\n\n* Does anyone else experience this symptom?\n* I'm worried about <symptoms>\n* 99M, 5'13, 5000lbs, here are my test results, is this anxiety or something else??\n* a 5000 word essay that essentially is just a list of symptoms\n* actual images of peoples' bodies + \"should I go to the doctor about this?\"\n* should I take medication? \n\nThe reassurance-seeking, asking for medical advice, and general lack of productive discussion has made us realize that r/HealthAnxiety, unless strictly moderated, is actively going to make peoples' Health Anxiety worse by nurturing their reassurance loops, answering medical questions, and creating a space where people vent only to be ignored or trolled. \n\nRegardless, if we just left the sub to run without any moderation, Reddit would ban it. And if it somehow wasn't banned, it would be overrun with bots, harmful content, and no real community at all. \n\nSo, we've been thinking of just redirecting the sub to r/OCD and r/Anxiety. But before we do anything drastic, I thought I'd toss this last message out there. What do you all suggest we do? The team is basically just me on queue (I've done 74% of mod actions since beginning of February alone, around 2500), and the rest taking care of Discord. \n\nI no longer have the time to provide this service, and I would much rather that everyone find other spaces that can actually curate for them than to keep this going to the detriment of its users.\n\nSo let us know in the comments. I'll relay feedback to what's left of the team, and we can take it from there.",

    "title": "Hi guys, this is my anxiety story.",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone! I’m new here, and new to reddit in general. My name is Cameron or Cam, I’m 22 years old and I have extreme health anxiety. I just wanted to tell you guys my most recent episode that took me through one of the biggest mental hula hoops I think I have ever experienced. Hopefully this can help someone one day when they are experiencing the phenomenon of health anxiety. \n\n**Very long, so understandable if you guys don’t want to read it all. \n\nSo about 2 weeks ago, I noticed a small lump on my chest. Immediately started freaking out and making a doctors appointment. Two days later I go to my doctors appointment, and explain to my GP what’s going on. She stated that’s it’s probably nothing to worry about, just a benign cyst or a fatty lump, which gave me some type of peace as I was still in the doctors office, and so I was on my way. As soon as I got into the car, I noticed myself already beginning to touch it over and over again. By the time I pulled into my driveway 15 mins later I was once again in full panic mode. Thinking “how could this just appear”, among other thoughts. Throughout the next few days I am a wreak, mind racing constantly and uncontrollably. My lovely girlfriend, Danielle has always been there for me and my anxiety episodes, she was trying her best to comfort me and help me in any way she could. However, my mental health had other plans and continued down the same depressing path as I was worrying constantly, crying daily and thinking about the worst and only the worst. Fast forward about a week after my first appointment, I was still convinced I had the worst and only the worst thing imaginable, so I schedule a second doctors appointment. Danielle and I go in and I explain to my GP for a second time that I’m feeling very uneasy about it, and it is destroying my mental health. We all talked for close to an hour about me and my mental health and everything going on which really helped me and she also asked if scheduling a ultrasound would be beneficial to my anxiety and give me some relief, Danielle and I immediately looked at each other and said yes! The next day after my appointment I was still surfing the internet looking at anything I could find to make my anxiety even worse. Around this time I was thinking wow I didn’t have any blood work done, and so I email my GP once again to set up a time to come do some blood work. Her being the wonderful doctor and understanding my mental health said “come anytime!” and so me worrying still makes my way back to the doctors office and gets my blood drawn. All day that day I was terrified about the results, my stomach had already been in knots for the past week, I could barely eat or sleep. The next day I got my results, which were all great!! That was a huge win for my mental health, right up until I ran my hand down my chest for the first time that morning. BOOM! All my anxiety ridden thoughts suddenly came rushing back like they never left. As I was still waiting to receive a phone call to schedule my highly anticipated ultrasound, I began to even look up ultrasound pictures to find out what the bad looked like vs the good (obviously me with 0 medical experience it all made 0 sense to me) but I still continued to make myself worry. The next day on a Wednesday, I got the phone call. There first appointment available was that Friday, so I took that one and started what was hopefully my last 2 days of barley being able to eat, sleep, or feel happy. Fast forward to Friday morning, I am super anxious, my mother comes with me to my appointment. From the time I picked her up that morning she was trying her best to make me happy, we went to eat breakfast at Denny’s Diner before my appointment, of course I could barley eat because my stomach was in knots. We head to my appointment after, and we are anxiously awaiting my name to be called to come back, I noticed myself praying for what seemed like the 5th or so time since I found the lump, praying to not only God, Jesus, but also my uncle, who tragically passed away in 2020. What seemed like hours, even though it was merely 10mins, they finally called my name. We go back and as soon as she starts she noticed my anxiety and how bad I was shaking, but stated that she is not a doctor so she isn’t allowed to say anything as far as what she sees. She also says, “it could be later today but most likely Monday before I got any results because it was Friday.” that instantly made me even more anxious, that I would have to endure another weekend feeling this mentally drained. We finish up and she says “if it was anything bad I would not be letting you go home today”, that surprisingly made me feel a little better, she was very nice about the whole process, very big props to her for also understanding my mental health. We leave the radiology department of the hospital and my mom takes me shopping for some new clothes for our cruise at the end of the month! I was feeling a little better now that the stressful part was over but still was feeling really anxious over the results and having to wait. A few hours later, I drop my mom off at her house, and she says to me again “it’s going to be okay!”. As soon as I pull out, my phone dings and it’s test results available on my chart. I immediately click on it, my heart is pounding and I read the results. “Muscular asymmetry, a begin lump of fatty tissue. With muscle mass greater on the left side of my chest than that on the right.” I was in awe. I immediately called my mom and said results are in and explained to her, I call my girlfriend, my dad, and ride over to my grandparents to tell them all the good news. Amazing. God is good, it felt almost as a huge weight was just lifted from my chest. That is the end of my most recent episode. Thank you so much for listening to whomever read through all of this. I just wanted to post my story on here to let everyone know, you’re not alone in the mental battle. Reddit helped me so much though this stuff, just reading other peoples story’s on here. I’ve talked to people through DMs who have mad me feel so much better and who has related their health anxiety. You may feel alone in the moment but I promise you, you’re not. Health anxiety is no joke and it should be taken seriously. I just received treatment for it for the first time, special thanks to all the people to messaged me, or commented on my other posts, giving me advice and sharing their stories. \n\nThank you guys so much for listening, Cam.",

    "selftext": "Hello all! I came across this group while in the midst of an “episode”. My husband (bless is heart) found this sub for me in his desperation to find anything he could do to help me while I was crying to him about my side pain and that I was probably dying of cancer. :/ It helped to read the threads and feel like I wasn’t alone! \n\nIt’s been a journey the past year or so with different aches, pains, hospital visits and some very real health concerns that only make things worse. Plus the fact I’m 32 weeks pregnant doesn’t help my body feel any more normal! \n\nAnyways, I’m here to share some advice from my therapist I’ve recently been seeing again. (I’ve seen him off and on since college for anxiety). Similar to what a previous thread mentioned, HA is a form of OCD. It stems from fear, and we all have coping mechanisms that we use to temporarily escape that fear. Similar to an OCD person focused on hygiene repeatedly washes their hands, they’re only temporarily resolving their germ issues. They’ll keep washing and washing every time they feel dirty. Similarly, an HA OCD person (if you’re like me) will Google and Google to temporary try to find an explanation for their pains, symptoms, etc. That compulsion isn’t solving the problem, it’s temporarily helping, while in the long run it hurts us or we discover a new disease we convince ourselves of having. \n\nHow do we overcome fears? How does a person overcome public speaking? They public speak. If a person was afraid of heights, but worked on the 85th floor of a building looking out their office window everyday….eventually they won’t fear heights. HA is a fear that we can face through acceptance. Accepting our HA fears as\npossibilities and leaning into them, will eventually numb us to its effects and we’ll no longer fear it. \n\nRemember: What I run from I give power to. What I run towards, I take power from. \n\nI hope this helps someone as it helped me!",

    "title": "PSA: Health Anxiety and OCD are very similar issues. Treating OCD is different from normal anxiety. Here's some tips.",
    "selftext": " I posted this a few months ago, but wanted to repost it.  Ultimately, I had *real* health problems that my OCD/HA exacerbated.  Luckily, I was able to get the \"all-clear\" from a doctor, but I had to do a lot of work in the months leading up to that to curb my anxiety, and I approached it all from a lens of OCD.\n\nThe  problem with OCD is that you see it portrayed in the media as  quirkiness, being obsessed with order, etc.  That's actually just a very  small subset of OCD.  There's so many more \"versions\" of OCD that no  one talks about, and because of that, people don't realize it's OCD  unless they're washing their hands/turning light switches.\n\nHealth-anxiety is actually considered a type of OCD.  Other types being contamination-OCD (fear of touching something or being contaminated), Sexual-OCD (Worrying about your sexual orientation and what you might be attracted to), Checking-OCD (needing to check the stove is off, you have your keys, etc.  This is the most well known OCD and is often how OCD is portrayed in media), Relationship-OCD (worrying if you love your partner, if they're being faithful, if you're good enough for them, etc.)\n\nBasically OCD boils down to this - you are highly afraid of something or a state of being, you consider this state of being incredibly bad if not the *worst possible thing that can happen to you*, so you create a system in order to reassure yourself that this isn't true.  For checkers that can mean checking the stove 18 times before you leave, if it's off 18 times, than that's good.  Except after a week, your brain goes \"well let's do it 19 times just to be sure\".  For us with health anxiety that means googling symptoms, asking relatives for guidance, constant doctor tests or even *avoiding* doctors for fear of what they tell you.\n\nThe  most helpful resources about OCD  I found are from Dr. Michael  Greenberg.  He has a few very short and simple articles about OCD, but  they are **the** most  helpful thing I've read for my health anxiety.  I can't stress that you  should read them even if you just have minor health anxiety, as they may  help you.  [https://drmichaeljgreenberg.com/articles/](https://drmichaeljgreenberg.com/articles/)\n\nAs  for my story, I had a run of semi-serious medical issues in the last year.  I always had health anxiety but this turned it up to 11.  I met with a new therapist in the fall and finally admitted to  myself that I may actually suffer from mild/moderate OCD.  It runs in  my family, I always knew I had tendencies, but I always was too ashamed  to admit that it actually was a huge part of my anxieties as well.\n\nI had two triggers in the last year and basically spent the next month or two going down a rabbit hole of anxiety.  Not sleeping, checking my poop constantly, calling friends who are in the health field, seeing multiple doctors, on multiple subreddits (also a bad idea btw), severely changing every aspect of my life to lessen my anxiety, etc.\n\nNo  matter what I did, though, I couldn't calm my fear down.  I kept trying  to find some smidgen of evidence that would put me at ease.  The  problem was that even when I found the piece of information I wanted, my  brain would immediately discredit it and try to find something else.  I  was chasing the dragon, and never getting to where I wanted to be.\n\nOver  the ups and downs of the last few months, I started to really notice  similarities between my emotions and anxieties, and that of someone with  OCD.  I read article after article, not about my health, but about OCD.   I felt understood, and heard, for the first time.  Turns out health  anxiety is a form of OCD, just as the person who washes their hands  frequently, or has to close and reopen doors constantly.  It's just that  the routines and the compulsions are *mental* and not physical.  I had no idea that was a thing.\n\nYou might have OCD if your health anxiety does the following:\n\nYou could be watching TV, not focused on anything else, out of nowhere you get a thought.\n\n\"Oh wait, I never checked out that bump on my leg\"\n\nYou *immediately*  feel a wave of panic, you start sweating, you feel cold.  You feel like  the world is ending, like your seconds from death.  It sounds stupid  now, but in the moment it feels so incredibly real.\n\nThis is your intrusive thought.\n\nYour next response is to check the lump.  Push it.  Prod it.  Shine a flashlight on it.  Look at it in different mirrors.\n\nThis is a compulsion.\n\nIt's  not enough, your fear is getting worse.  You hop onto your phone and  start frantically googling. \"Lump on leg\" \"signs of skin cancer\"  \"lump  on leg serious?\" \"symptoms of bone cancer\" \"Symptoms of hypo-thyroidism\"  etc. etc.\n\nThis is another compulsion.\n\nEventually  you're exhausted.  Your spent.  The adrenaline is gone and you're just  scared and anxious.  You slowly recover and try to live your life again.   Only to have the entire cycle repeat.\n\nJust  like the person who touched a door knob and needs to wash their hands  endlessly.  You are hit with an anxious thought and need to \"cleanse\"  your anxiety by finding evidence that will tell you you're ok.  However,  just like with the hand washer, just once isn't enough.  Your brain  requires more and more and more until your hands are bleeding or your  mind is a mess.\n\nThis is OCD, and the sooner you start treating your HA like this, the better.  I promise.\n\nI  have so much more to say, but I think the articles I listed above will  be far more helpful.  I'm also more than happy to add more or answer any  questions.\n\nBe well, friends.  You're going to be ok.",

    "selftext": "I was talking to the nurse at work about my anxiety, and she explained something to me that I’ve found quite comforting and has helped me rationalise quite a lot.\n\nBack when we were cavemen, we would get anxious when, for example, in the dark outside and not knowing what big strange creature is about to come and eat you.\n\nToday, our world has completely changed and we don’t face the same threats, however, our bodies are still the same. For example, cavemen didn’t care about how fat they looked in their animal skins but our society today has made this something to be anxious about, even though it isn’t life or death. However, you feel like you’re dying when you’re anxious because that’s what your body /expects to happen/ as that’s what would happen when we were cavemen, so wearing that new dress that hugs your figure literally becomes a life or death situation.\n\nWith health anxiety, you have an intrusive thought or one easily explained symptom or see a post about a disease or Google your symptoms and your anxiety takes it and convinces you you’re dying because you’re in a state of fight or flight, life or death, and that is the issue you’re worried about so that must be about to cause your imminent death.\n\nAnxiety is not your enemy. Your anxiety is trying to keep you alive, but it doesn’t understand that the world has changed and, sometimes, when we’re worried or scared, it isn’t necessarily a life or death situation. It wants to protect you, but because we aren’t about to be eaten by a big prehistoric creature, it doesn’t know how to deal with your current worries so gives the response it was trained to give, and it hasn’t been on a training course in a long, long time, so it’s material is very out of date.\n\nThat’s why we seek reassurance - it made us feel better last time, so our anxiety recognises it as something that works to save your life, and makes you do it again and again every time it wants to protect you.\n\nFor people who suffer with anxiety, our anxiety is overprotective of us. Any slight nervous feeling or worry has it putting on its best animal skin, picking up its sharpest wooden spear and jumping and screaming at anything and everything that is making you feel bad, convinced that if it doesn’t protect you then you will die then and there.\n\nWhen you’re anxious, you can experience such things as:\n- Feeling dizzy, can’t think, brain fog\n- headaches\n- increased heart beat\n- increased sweat\n- worsened/dulled senses\n- tight chest, breathlessness\n- going to the toilet more frequently\n- shakes/trembling\n- tingling/pins and needles\n- nausea/vomiting\n\nand many more, literally hundreds of responses because your body is doing /anything it can think of/ to save your life because you haven’t run away from what you’re anxious about and it doesn’t know how else to make it better. It’s panicking because the human it has sworn to protect is nervous about something and it doesn’t know what to do to help because nothing in the manual of how to outrun big man-eating creatures is working, so it is doing anything and everything, not realising that this is making you feel worse.\n\nIt makes sense - if someone was about to shank you, you’d go into fight or flight, flood with adrenaline, your brain going foggy and zeroing in on the threat (ever heard something like ‘I can’t remember their face, I was fixated on the knife’?), your heart picking up to pump blood everywhere and keep your body oxygenated to fight or run away for as long as you can. That is all anxiety’s doing.\nIn this case, the knife is the symptom. You can’t think of anything else because your brain has zeroed in on it, but you can’t run away so you fixate on it constantly and your anxiety gets worse and worse as it tries harder and harder to save your life from something that is not a big monster that has come to eat you.\n\nYou’re valid for feeling this way. People don’t understand that your anxiety feels like you’re dying because they don’t understand that that’s what you’re subconsciously expecting. ‘It’s all in your head’ no it’s not, your /whole body/ is trying to fight a threat.\n\nBe kind to yourself. You aren’t stupid or overreacting, you just want to live. Don’t you dare let anyone brush you off or make you feel bad for trying❤️",

This week’s session we had a great breakthrough. \n\nI am deathly allergic to nuts and have had multiple, life threatening scares. The first was when I was a toddler and most recently in November (I’m 27). I’ve become somewhat accustomed to dealing with my reactions but never really stepped back and thought about how traumatic these experiences truly are.\n\nFor my entire life I’ve had to be on edge around food in fear that a bite could cause my throat to close. Every single restaurant I go to, every meal I eat there’s a fear that during the first few minutes I’ll need to rush to the hospital. I overanalyze my entire body waiting for a reaction. This hyper fixation on listening to my body has spilt over into listening to every. single. little. thing.\n\nMy only coping mechanism when my health anxiety gets really bad is to come here and read what others are going through. Makes me feel like I’m not alone. Not sure if this will help anyone, but even if it only helps one of you, it’ll have been worth posting.",

Around this time last year after recovering from COVID-19, I had a fixation over my heart and my lungs, especially since my grandmother died from lung cancer. Then, towards the latter part of 2021 I was scared that I might have a brain aneurysm since I kept on getting headaches all the time. And now I'm terrified of getting a brain tumor. I get paranoid over my stupidity, the slightest differences in my actions and behaviors, and the sensations in my body, which leads me to googling the symptoms of a brain tumor, which then causes me to be more paranoid and anxious. This also happened when I with the whole heart/lung and brain aneurysm thing. It doesn't help that I see news on social media of people, whether it be celebrities or acquaintances of acquaintances, dying from either disclosed or undisclosed diseases. That was literally the reason why I had to delete the Facebook app off my phone so I wouldn't have the urge to open it for mindless scrolling. It has fucked me over so hard that I can't even have a good time with my parents or friends without these thoughts popping up out of nowhere and ruining my mood. And now I am awake at 1 in the morning typing all of this out instead of sleeping since I have to be awake at 7 since I have class. I also forgot to mention that these kinds of things keep me up until 3-4 in the morning, which has screwed over my already fucked-up sleep schedule. I'm really just hoping that this is my PMS acting up (I haven't had my period yet) because I really just want these thoughts to stop. Although it's good to show concern over your health, it shouldn't happen to the extent where it's ruining you mentally.",

I NEVER go to the doctor because I'm afraid if I go they'll tell me something really bad is wrong with me. There's certain things I'm fixated on (I won't name them because I don't want anyone else to think about them) that I've convinced myself that if I think about them, read about them, hear about them etc. I'll get them because they're on my mind so much I'll basically attract it???

That's not how that works!\" but it still happens.\n\nMy husband is so incredibly patient with me but I know it's super annoying/frustrating. He's constantly telling me there's nothing wrong with me and reassuring me. He also is the only reason I've cut down on Googling. He puts up with me freaking out about being \"overly tired\", always assures me that yes the amount of food I ate in a meal is not less than usual. This is probably TMI but this is even affecting the intimacy in my marriage. I'm afraid to do anything physical anymore. Not that I don't want to, but I'm just scared to because what if I feel some kind of pain or something and that'll trigger a whole thing.\n\nThis is even spreading to other areas in my life.

    "selftext": "Hi all, I hope everyone is doing well and feeling well! \n\nI have been pretty stressed today and decided to come on here to see if anyone has felt the same way or could possibly offer any explanation / advice. \n\nI’ve noticed over the past year or so that I tend to get chest pain when I am extremely excited. Most recent example would be at a concert. I’ve had chest pain before when I am extremely worried about my health and obsessing over my heart rate, but I can usually calm myself down and rationalize that it is likely cause by anxiety. \n\nHowever, it is the chest pain when I am actually extremely happy that is starting to scare the crap out of me. I first noticed it a few months ago when I rode a roller coaster. For context, I absolutely love roller coasters, so I was not scared. I got on a coaster I had been waiting ages to ride, and I LOVED it an was absolutely beyond ecstatic to actually be on it. However, as soon as the ride stopped, my smile dropped because I felt a really unpleasant chest pain. It wasn’t a stabbing pain, but more of just like a solid ache in the middle of my chest. My heart rate was high which makes sense, but I am unsure as to where to pain would be coming from. \n\nIt happened three more times since then, and all at concerts. I also love live music and have been dying to get back to shows. But ay every concert, I have noticed when I start to really get hyped up, sing along to songs and dance, I get that same feeling. It doesn’t travel down my arms or anything but it is definitely a noticeable discomfort in my chest. The pain isn’t unbearable but it’s 100% there. I’ll have to take a minute to stop singing along and calm myself down, and that gets it to go away. If I start to get carried away / really excited again, though, it’ll come back. \n\nIt basically just occurs when I am REALLY happy, which is bizarre and makes it all the more worrisome for me. \n\nI have a doctors appointment in a little over a week so that will be good for me. But I’m admittedly really starting to spiral. Everything I have been reading genuinely seems to lead me to believe that there is something wrong. My dad had a heart attack when he was 45 and both of my grandparents on my mother’s side died from heart failure. \n\nJust some other info, I am a 23 year old male and mostly have few other symptoms. I do get heart palpitations somehow regularly but that is about it. My resting heart rate can be high from time to time, but is usually pretty standard. Averaging in the 80bpm range, I would say. Has anyone else ever felt like this? Or know of something non-life threatening that could offer an explanation? \n\nOnce again, hope you all are well and having a great day!",

I'm thankful for the posts I've seen so far; it's nice to see that I'm not alone (although ideally none of us would need to be here but again, ideal thinking!)\n\nI'll get to the point of my post now. I've been struggling from health anxiety since 2016 when my husband was given a scary diagnosis at an appointment. Throughout the years I've managed the anxiety that has brought me to varying degrees. Currently I am riding through my second relapse of HA which started about a year ago when my husband started going back for evaluation. He's had several appointments over the past year. Throughout the years he has had many symptoms of varying severity, though nothing has been truly catastrophic to date. My HA comes into play when I notice symptoms, or think something is wrong when it's not, and start tying small things to a bigger, badder, scarier problem related to his diagnosis.\n\nI don't often come across HA sufferers that primarily focus on a significant other's health issues and I was wondering, has anybody else been through \"proxy HA\" before? Do you have any tips or advice on methods you use to calm your mind when anxiety starts to spiral?\n\nThanks for reading!",

    "selftext": "It is a pretty long post. I just wanted to share about my experience since I have not actually talked to anyone about it beside my parents. Even with my parents, I just told them that I sometime worry about my health too much thats all.\n\nHaving anxiety about health really affected my daily life. Especially when I am still very young (24M) when you are suppose to be care free and live your life. Today is my friend birthday, we gathered up for dinner with a bunch of other common friends. As usual, I constantly check my HR on my Fitbit since eating can raise it. Actually, I was able get through the dinner just fine. Good food, good talk but was not able to drink alcohol (scare of raising my HR). After that we decided to go to a bar. I was really hesitate but since we're in such a good mood and I felt fine at that time, I decided to tag along. When I got to the club and the loud music start to hit, the anxiety kind of creep it way up. I was at the dance floor for one song barely moving and constantly look my watch. 115 - \"Oh you're probably fine. This just like an exercise\" I told to myself. And then my HR keep climbing 120 and 130. I started to feel really anxious, the loud music and the crowd did help at all. Finally I have to tell my friend that I am not feeling so well and went home. Making my way out of the club, I am immediately calmer, my HR return to normal. But on the way home, I cant help but feel repentant about my situation. The truth is I really enjoying dancing and my friend was having so much fun there. Before this whole health anxiety, I was as care free as possible. Go clubbing, drinking, dancing, went on a roller coaster ride, working out, running you name it. I did all of those without any worries. Right every task daily I have to check my HR, I always worry why it is too high or too low. Every small symptoms or an ache make me google and wonder if I have any diseases.\n\nSome background on how I develop this anxiety about health. I am studying abroad and living away from my family. During the winter of 2020 which was the pandemic time, I was staying inside my room most of the time playing video games. I was staying up late, not eating really well and not working out like I used to. This probably had a lot effect on me. And then the summer 2021 came. The sudden sun light time change along with poor sleep schedule from earlier make everything worse. I started to sleep less and noticing I have lost a lot weight in that period. And then come to a night when I could not sleep at all for that whole day, I start to have weird symptoms all over the place. I start to freak out and when to the doctor saying that I can not sleep and my HR beats fast. Initially, they order a bunch of tests on the seconds appointment (yes, I went to the doctor twice in the spans of 3 days). Eventually, everything is still normal. But my worries did not went away. I started to spends tons of money on fitness watch, blood pressure monitor.\n\nTo this day, it is almost 9 months after (a lots more doctor appointment which also came back fine) I still feel anxious. It is definitely better from the beginning but still the affects is real. I also want to say that, I am still looking forward to overcome this, I really do want to experience everything fun like I used to do. It is summer again, maybe I gonna start training to run to have more confident on my HR. Thanks you so much if you read until now. I just want to get this of my chest. Feel free to share yours experience or maybe share what has helped you! Much love!",

I eventually went to the hospital in the middle of a full blown panic attack because I felt like I was dying (I was not). But found out I had an extremely bad case of mono that I had probably had for months. I also had an experience with really bad abdominal pain and a male doctor said I was having cramps, but after going back to a female doctor I found out I had a huge ovarian cyst that had burst and caused internal bleeding. So I think mine originated from not being able to fully trust doctors, because before these events I barely even understood what anxiety was. I’m scared to even tell doctors I have anxiety because then I feel like they’ll just brush my health concerns off. Just curious about everyone else’s stories!",

For instance I've changed my eating and exercise habits for the better and even lost some weight (all in attempt to keep away negative health issues) that I gained before my anxiety started.  However, it is also starting to affect my work and home life because my emotions are a roller coaster and I spend SO MUCH time googling every little ache and pain I have (I am aware this is a bad thing to do and only increases the anxiety but I can't figure out how to stop).\n\nThis story of how it started has its beginnings all the way back in March of 2020.  My mom passed away from ovarian cancer. During the clean up of her house, we found a journal of hers where she wrote in 2017, \"I think I have cancer\" but never went to the doctor to get it checked out.  So, my daughter, who at the time was 7 years old, asked me if I could get cancer.  I explained to her, the best I could, that anyone could but I was overall pretty healthy (except for being overweight) and I would go to the doctor if I ever felt something was wrong and not be like her grandmother had been.\n\nWell, about a year later she asked me if I would go to the doctor and get a physical (I still don't know where this came from or if she learned about it in school or heard it somewhere) because she didn't want me to miss something and \"end up dead like mom-mom\".  Trying to ease HER anxiety (at the time I still had none of my own), I scheduled a physical to take place December 2021 with blood work and urine to boot.  Doc does the physical, finds some concerning things, and asks me to retest in a few months (those few months is where the anxiety really kicked in).\n\nTo make an already long story as short as I can, my follow up tests came back fine (except for one thing that I'm still being evaluated for.... being purposely vague to respect the rules of this group). However, all of this has led me to have a health anxiety I've never had before.  Every little ache or pain, every muscle twitch, everything.... I just \"know\" I'm dying from it.  Even the thing I am still being evaluated for is, by both my doctor's assurance and the internet, most likely totally treatable but in MY HEAD it's going to be the worst possible outcome.\n\nI'm constantly googling symptoms, reading journal articles or talking with my wife about \"what if\" and I can tell she's starting to get annoyed with me but still being as supportive as she can be. Sometimes, my work even starts to get backed up because instead of doing what I should be doing I'm checking symptoms or reading about some rare disease of which I've convinced myself I have symptoms.\n\nSo, the bottom line of why I'm here getting advice from all of you is this: what do I do?  I mean, I know googling is not good for my mental health but how do I stop?  Do I bring this up to my doctor? Do you all have advice for how to deal with it?  Anything will help.",

    "selftext": "Ideally none of us want to be here as sufferers. But this sub offers comfort to some. My personal experience could help a few.\n\n(Mine started with a headache and I googled it. The rarest and the worst diseases came up and since it was the first time facing HA I was scared. Prior to this I was such a strong person mentally and Now I am managing to deal with HA particularly  well. Even though I get waves of Ha from time to time.)\n\nFew things to have in mind:\n(Fears: Anything neuro related, remaining everything not too focused)\n\n-I know I have twitched for countless number of years say 7 years but I barely cared. But With HA this twitching only increased(or I am noticing everything ) . Twitching is quite common and so are burning sensations, tremors, feeling weak to name a few.\n\n-Try to interact with people a lot more. \nThe best thing to do is to have conversations with friends and family and your significant other. Being from India I am blessed in that way. Notice well that, when u are around them u don’t notice ur symptoms that badly or they won’t even be present. This just reassures that it is just ur anxiety showing up as physical symptoms.\n\n-Even if you are fixating on the worst of the worst then the best thing to do is visit a doctor. But if a doctor says it is nothing to be worried about, then so be it don’t stress on it. Indian doctors see approx. 500+ patients a month, don’t u think they know what they are talking about. I had a brain mri showed an arachnoid cyst, neurosurgeon said it’s nothing, and I have been least bothered. Just trust ur doctors.\n\n- keep yourself busy. I have seen people saying that they have quit jobs. Although I understand the suffering from HA, don’t u think that being alone without being busy is worse on our mind and we get more stressed. Focusing on a job can be very very helpful just don’t stress on common bodily signs, like the doctors say the body is quite noisy.\n\n- Most of us who have been here have fixated on not just one problem but so many different ones. Let’s put things into perspective. Stop thinking that what you are dealing with is real. Just think of how many diseases you think u have had once u started having HA and before.(my experience 0 before HA). \n\nWe are all healthy in most ways it’s just anxiety kicks up so many physical symptoms that we are scared of everything afterwards. We may know everything I have said here in this post but it feels better when someone else says it, doesn’t it? Get out of HA live life to the fullest.",

Less so worrying about my symptoms, more so just aware of the fact that I’ve got health anxiety and have been freaking out recently, which is making me more anxious.\n\nIt doesn’t help that I actually am ill (hard to believe on a health anxiety post I know but I had this before I had the anxiety) and I don’t know what’s wrong, I suspect anaemia, but all of the doctors are booked until the end of April or into May. But then again what if I just thought I had anaemia and my body is making the symptoms up? How the hell can I tell what’s real and what’s not? I feel like I’m going insane.\n\nI have a constant internal monologue. Distraction barely works, only a couple of things have managed to distract me and even then as soon as I stop my mind is like oh you’ve been having health anxiety.\n\nI don’t know how to stop thinking it, how do you stop a thought? I’ve rationalised it and tried telling myself that I’m fine and I don’t need to worry and I don’t need to think about it, I’ve tried crying it out, I’ve tried just getting on with my life and being busy but the awareness is there in the back of my mind and it doesn’t fucking stop, I feel like I’m going insane, like I’m going to be thinking about it forever. Even when I actively try to force myself to think about something else, it’s still there.\n\nOf course the more I think about it the more anxious I get and then my chest feels tight and I feel dizzy which convinces me im not breathing properly. I had to run out of work at the end of my shift yesterday to lock myself in the car and have an anxiety attack. It’s so annoying because I know that im fine, I know that this is all irrational and im not even set off by any ‘symptom’ half the time, just the general thought that I have been having it recently.\n\nMy job is also not enough to distract me, I sort paperwork for archiving which doesn’t take a lot of brain power so sitting there for hours thinking about it obviously is not amazing. \n\nIm scared that when I go back to uni from my parent’s house I won’t be able to cope because I already can’t cope now and the only thing that seems to calm me down somehow is being in direct proximity to my mother and even then I’m thinking about it, I’m just comforted by the thought that if something happens she can do something about it. Being alone in my uni room seems like a hell I don’t want to face.\n\nI just don’t know what to do. Maybe I need intense therapy I don’t know but I can’t live my life like this, it’s too hard. I’m crying again I’m meant to be getting up and going to work, how am I even meant to drive my car? How am I meant to sit at work and not break down? How do I stop thinking?",

    "selftext": "Since about three or four days ago, after sensing a vague  and non-painful wave of pressure moving from one ear to the other while I was in the midst of eating a large meal, I have been completely and utterly debilitated by health anxiety. I had bouts with it as a teenager but was stable for years.\n\nThe rest of that day was uncomfortable but by the same time the day after I felt relatively normal again; until I thought I detected the same sensation, once again, during a (admittedly ridiculous) large meal.\n\nI had a rapid heartbeat for the remainder of the afternoon but particularly the next day, at which point I suffered a full blown panic attack and went to urgent care for an ECG. They detected no abnormalities other than palpitations which they chalked up to the stress.\n\nEver since I returned home I've ironically been disturbed by the opposite sensation. My heart feels slow and weak even when I'm extremely anxious. My BPM seems healthy during panic/anxiety but doesn't really elevate to any significant degree.\n\nIt's been a little while longer now and after going to urgent care again after panicking over tiny pinprick spots on my arms I'm dealing with derealization that makes me feel like I'm going insane. Every night I've been waking up at 3am and scaring myself to death looking up other people's experiences and researching symptoms even though I know I shouldn't. This is usually accompanied by some physical effects like a feverish sensation, chest pain or lightheadedness. Almost flu-like.\n\nTonight, though, there's just this inexplicable feeling that something is terribly wrong and an eery calm in my body. My heartbeat feels slow and relaxed and yet I can't get to sleep for the life of me. My mind is unfocused and if I try to close my eyes or even just lie there I start to experience racing nonsensical thoughts that aren't even coherent. It's maddening and I feel like I'm going insane. It feels like I'm not in control of my own mind. Now I've begun to fret about schizophrenia or some form of psychosis or brain diaease.\n\nI feel like an outside observer of my own life and I am *horrified* by the idea of forgetting who I or my loved ones are or even just pushing them away due to forever being a non-functional anxious mess that can't offer anything.\n\nPhysically all I feel is an urge to vomit every now and again and a restlessness in my legs, as well as a tension or warmth in my shoulders when I try to sleep.\n\nI'm clearly panicking but why doesn't it feel like I am? You'd think this would be a good thing but it's scary beyond belief that I'm in this mental distress and state of restlessness but I'm not experiencing most panic attack symptoms. I feel relaxed and yet... Terrified.\n\nI just want to go back to normal again. This is torturous.\nI really took for granted how good it feels to be stable of mind and anxiety free, and now I'm locked in a neverending days long panic attack where the only relief is the limited period just before I finally fall asleep, during unconsciousness, or a few moments after I wake up.\n\nWhen I wake I usually feel like I'm possibly fine, but inevitably I'm hit by all kinds of symptoms and duress and it starts all over again.\n\nI can never even begin to be calm enough for grounding or mindfulness techniques to work.",

    "selftext": "Long doozy of a story. I got COVID in January and it presented itself as a stomach flu. I was more or less cooped up in my house for a week, constantly googling every weird symptom. I went to the ER 5 times in a week. Stayed up for almost 3 days in a row (never had insomnia before this). Tried to get a room in the psych ward and waited for 48 hours in holding until I realized I wasn’t getting a room due to still being COVID positive. While I was there, I started to experience head and body numbness/tingling, and some mild psychosis (I’ve dealt with anxiety/depression my whole life but never gotten to this state). Possible PTSD as well from the way the nurses treated me. When I got out, I spent another week struggling with insomnia and body numbness until I threatened to end it all and my boyfriend convinced me to check into a behavioral health center….\n\nFive days later I feel pretty good. My psychiatric meds were switched around and I was starting to get a more consistent nights sleep. Still got random tingling and numbness but not nearly as bad. Health related anxiety was starting to go away. I was fine for about 4 weeks. \n\nSince I was starting to get better I mistakenly thought maybe I could skip my nightly Trazadone. I woke up in a severe panic and for the next nine days I dealt with severe panic attacks, insomnia, chills, numbness, diarrhea, loss of appetite. I have convinced myself I have MS, thyroid problems, fatal familial insomnia, diverticulitis, multiple forms of cancer, the whole gambit. My psychiatrist bumped up my lexapro, Trazodone, and propranolol. Taking 100 mg of Trazodone combined with hydroxyzine and melatonin caused me to wake up several times in one night thinking I had stopped breathing. My sleep is finally starting to come back with only 50 mg Trazodone and I’m feeling better overall but I’m terrified of another episode like this happening again. I am getting my hormones and thyroid tested tomorrow because I’m paranoid my IUD is causing all these issues. I have a GI doc appointment in a few weeks. I am starting therapy in a few weeks. I’m stressed out because I can’t see a neurologist till July. I just need some advice on how to live with HA until I can see my therapist/get some test results back…",

I was thinking it may be skin issue or something, but doctors didn't saw something visible also did a lot of blood tests. After some time a new feeling was added to me. Kind of dizziness/light headed where I think I may faint or something, sometime also my heart raising a bit.  \n\n\nI'm a bit frustrated cause usually I'm able to find people similar issues like mine when I had different anxiety but specific for the issue with feeling the sun burns  I have not found anyone.  \n\n\nApart from that in the last week I started taking myself to the beach and sit there 10-15 minutes no matter what and do kind of meditation (kinda like exposure therapy). I hope it will help on the long term, btw I don't take any medication yet.

Not sure what caused it. I started taking zoloft (which I have taken before), and I was at work (thank God I work from home), and the first thing that happened was my chest started hurting in one specific spot. Thought it was GERT related, but it hurt really bad, then my arm started to go a little numb and felt like a tingling feeling in it, so my first thought was, heart attack. \n\nI almost went to ER that day, but my brother came and talked to me and helped me calm down and get out of it. But it lasted a good 2 hours. Then, they got worse.. \n\nA few days later, I had another one, but this time, my left arm had pains in it. I was laying in bed watching some Netflix oj my phone, then my arm started acting funny. Went numb, got a tingling feeling in it, and the moment I felt a pain in my left arm I PANICKED. I legit thought this time was a heart attack. This time it lasted for about 2-3 hours, I had to call my mom, and after a long talk I was able to go to bed. \n\nThird one I had that I can remember was last night. I was playing my ps5, then out of nowhere, the left arm pain started AGAIN. I was so aggravated and tired that I almost couldn't fight off the panic. I had to tell my friends online I was getting off, went and took a shower, and nothing helped. I had to go over to my aunts house and she took my oxygen levels, blood pressure, and blood sugar. Guess what? ALL OF IT WAS NORMAL. I was so worried my BP would be through the roof and it WASN'T. \n\nI don't understand why this is happening. I am scared. I have a wife and a beautiful little girl to take care of, I cannot feel like this every day!! Does anyone else have the same symptoms, feelings, etc?",

They’re literally just relaxed and taking a nap and here I am getting completely lost and having a panic attack and crying about the idea that one of us is suddenly on death row or something.\n\nHealth anxiety is, I feel, something that can just be caused by so many different factors and events in life that it’s just so hard to take a step back sometimes and examine how the hell things got so bad and how to even begin making it better, yaknow?

Well lo and behold I get Covid December 13th of 2021. Keep in mind I was unvaccinated as I have a horrible fear of needles, actually ran out of a doctors office as a child when it was time for me to get a shot that’s how much I hate them. Now actually I didn’t know I had it until December 22nd once a family member of mine got tested which means I was around people throughout the whole duration of my Covid unintentionally 😬, thought it was sinusitis. For those wondering my symptoms were I was very fatigued for like 2 days, sinuses burned like hell to inhale for almost a month, felt like an 80 year old man for 2 days, congestion lasted a week, runny nose for a week, post nasal drip for 1-3 days, hot flashes for two weeks, very little appetite for 3 days, and no sense of smell which has gradually come back over a period of 3 months. Now while writing these symptoms down it sounds a lot worse than it was. Shit I actually ran a mile while I had Covid so I wasn’t doing terrible and still carried out my normal daily activities. Unfortunately the rest of my family shortly got it after me, all of them were fine including my double immunocompromised mother.\n\nNow after this whole month long ordeal my fear of Covid is practically gone. For those who have yet to have it while yes a very small population of people get it pretty bad, if you ever get it you will be surprised at how mild it is for how much you fear it. Nor is this meant to belittle those who actually got COVID seriously bad, just wanted to share my experience to hopefully make some people more at ease with Covid.",

There would be symptoms that **don't go away**. A swelling in legs that lasts weeks, pain that never stops, breathing issues that get worst through months etc; And for all of you that have been checked by doctors and told all clear - a sick heart would show up on **every, no matter how basic, of a test**  doctors do. It would show up in blood works, it would show up in EKG, it would show up during a basic listen of the heart that doctors do all the damn time, every time you go and ask for a check up. The symptoms of a sick heart ***do not hide.*** They make themselves present and every doctor will be able to see them and send you for further help asap; \n\n&#x200B;\n\n2.   A sudden heart attack/cardiac arrest can happen under only a few circumstances:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Your heart is sick/born with a defect from birth; These types of sudden heart attacks/arrest are often if not always the result of someone not having symptoms and ***NOT CHECKING*** their heart fully; They're usually quite young people who's never been to a doctor to get their heart checked and just **assume** that theres nothing wrong with them. I have a friend, 22F, with no symptoms that went for a day-to-date easy check up and the doctor heard a murmur in her heart **straight away** and now she knows what to do and what not to do; If your doctor has checked you and told you your heart is healthy that means its just that - **healthy with no birth defect;**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- You've lived usually 40+ years of unhealthy lifestyle and you're probably also dealing with other issues such as high cholesterol, arteries build up etc, things that doctors, ***AGAIN***, would have caught by now and told you to be careful and change your lifestyle for the better if you don't want to suffer a heart attack. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- An accident, like getting electrocuted; \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**A healthy heart does not just GIVE UP without outside force making it do so.** \n\nThat outside force can also be food, stress, sedentary lifestyle, but these are all things you can help yourself with; If it's something you can't help, like lets say hormones during period/pregnancies  (like it was for me) or work related stress, all you can do is wait it out and believe it will come to an end; ***It always does;*** \n\n   \n\n&#x200B;\n\n3.  People who are perfectionists and good at focusing at a specific task until they fix the problem can and most likely will induce their own heart symptoms; I know that I do. I'm not much of a perfectionist myself, but I can focus very strongly on things that I deem important; If there's a problem I'll focus on it until I've made it go away. However, example, focusing on a heart palpitations I've got only makes me more stressed which in result brings **even more palpitations** and the circle begins; Realising that you're good at focusing can help you next time a symptom appears and your first instinct is to focus on it, examine it from all sides, think of all possible outcomes and completely ruin your mental peace in the process which leads to even more anxiety and even more symptoms; \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIts nearly impossible to **STOP** focusing on something that scares you; So the alternative is, instead of stopping the focus, to **shift it to LOGIC**. Shift it to past experiences when you've had this symptom and it's gone away on its own; Shift to doctors telling you you're fine. Shift to \"I just had a lot of chocolate today\", \"its hormones\", \"Its just stress\"; And no, this is **not ignoring the problem**. Believe me, I've been there and I'd tell myself \"what are you doing!!! How can you try to calm yourself that its just stress?? What if this time its not??? What if this time you're really really dying???!!?\"... and well, the simple \"**what if THIS TIME**\" in there should be enough to remind me that its happened before and well, I'm still here; \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope this helps you a bit; Remember, you can always get checked by a doctor, even if its your 100th time, if that brings you peace, there's no shame in that; I hope you feel better vey soon and have a wonderful day! :)",

    "selftext": "Hey listen,\n\nI have been where you have been, I’m 27 years old and in the past year I’ve had the following “symptoms” :\n\n- twitching all over my body\n- numb arms in the morning\n- such blurry vision I couldn’t read the computer\n- dizziness (I constantly felt drunk)\n- Yellow shits with bits in (purely from worry and anxiety, anxiety makes your digestion super fast)\n- stomach ache\n- Spasming stomach\n- bloating which was so uncomfortable\n- constant acid reflux\n- a white covered tongue \n- inability to think, unable to concentrate completely zoned out like a zombie\n- heart jumps and scares\n- Bloodshot eyes\n- chest tightness and pain\n- headaches\n- migraines with aura\n- ear ache\n- ringing in my ear\n- crawling sensation in my ear\n- ulcers like all the time\n- felt weak (e.g. In the gym)\n- Nausea\n- Back pain\n- Joint pain\n- jittery jaw/ involuntary jaw moving\n- swollen lymph nodes\n- numbness and tingling down one side of face \n\n\nAs a result of this I had the following tests:\n\n- 1 MRI\n- About 30 blood tests (diabetes, thyroid, full blood count you name it, I’ve had it)\n- About 5 stool tests\n- 1 ECG\n- 2 “emergency” hospital rushes\n- 1 x-Ray\n- Ears checked multiple times\n- Saw an ENT specialist twice\n- Saw a neurology specialist\n- Had an oral cancer screening (have a single tonsil up)\n- Had a mole checked\n- got a lump in my tongue checked\n(Definitely had more than this too)\n\nPaid privately for screenings and all sorts (I’m from the UK so healthcare is free)\n\n\nI’ve convinced myself I’ve had the following illnesses at times:\n\n- MS\n- Lymes disease\n- Skin cancer\n- Oral cancer\n- Bowel Cancer\n- A Stroke\n- Brain tumor\n- Heart attack\nEtc etc....\n\nGuess how many things I had wrong with me?\n\n##**ZERO!**\n\nI was worried about a few things, one was a lump in my tongue which the doctor said was fine, and now I’ve learnt to accept that they are right.\n\nI’m still here, I still have the lump, everything is okay and it’s the same for you.\n\n——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————\n\nThe best things you can do to help yourself are:\n\n###**1) DO NOT FUCKING GOOGLE EVER**\n\nI stopped googling about 2 months ago, been 100x better ever since.\n\nHas google ever helped you identify a killer disease? Nope didn’t think so.\n\n\n###**2) TRY TO BE RATIONAL**\n\nThe best thing you can do if you think something is wrong is tell yourself:\n\n“okay I have found this, what is the most likely cause”\n(the most likely thing is that it is something benign) \n\n“okay then I will wait for 2 weeks and then go to the doctor”\n\n9.9 times out of 10 it will be gone\n\n\n###**3) REALISE THAT YOU HAVE TO DO THIS YOURSELF - IGNORE YOUR SUBCONSCIOUS MIND AND TAKE CONTROL OF YOUR THOUGHTS**\n\nAre you going to honestly let your own brain control how you feel for the rest of your life? Take the time to take control now. It’s honestly completely in your control.\n\nTake a moment and consider what you are doing, there are two people in your head, your conscious self (if you choose to think something) and your unconscious self, which is there doing its own thing.\n\nThe unconscious self will make you think things are wrong with you, but you need to take control and not let it control you. As soon as you let yourself think you have something your body will feel as if you have it.\n\nIt sounds dumb as fuck, but you need to choose to be healthy, choose that you are okay. Because by choosing that you’re not okay.... shock you’re not okay!\n\nEvery single one was manifested by myself cos I allowed myself to get so worked up and stressed.\n\n\n###**4) LOOK AFTER YOURSELF**\n\nSleep, exercise etc will help. I had a vitamin D deficiency which was definitely contributing to my anxiety, get a test for that if you don’t get much sun, almost everyone is deficient in it.\n\nHeck take a low dose regardless the placebo effect might help!\n\n\n###**5) THINK ABOUT THE PAST**\n\nHow many times have we been though this? How many times have you had a deadly infections disease?\n\nAre you dead?\n\nNo. Why? Because the average life expectancy is like 80 years old....\n\n###**6) BELIEVE YOUR DOCTOR**\n\nHow many times have you seen a doctor? How many times were they right? \n\n“But they only looked for one second they must be doing a bad job” - no they’ve just seen whatever you’re showing them 39728364 times before they know what good looks like. If they were worried they would look for longer.\n\nThese people are medical professionals because they love people, including you.\n\n\n###**7) THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE**\n\nWould you rather spend the rest of your life, no matter how long or short it may be like this?\n\nYou’ve got shit to go and be successful at, and you sure as hell will struggle if you let something consume you like anxiety will.\n\nIt’s no good being alive but not living, go and live!\n\n\n###**8) DON’T FUCKING GOOGLE**\n\nJust incase you didn’t read the first time.\n\n###**9) TALK TO PEOPLE**\n\nMore people have anxiety than you think, almost everyone above like 25 has been anxious or depressed.\n\nTherapy is good, get it if you can, but ultimately it’s up to you to take control and ‘make yourself healthy’\n\n###**10)  STOP CHECKING STUFF**\n\nPoking, prodding, opening, touching all makes things dirty, swollen, irritated. Whatever is “wrong with you” will not go away if you keep fucking touching it.\n\nApply a rule to yourself like “I will leave it alone for 2 weeks and then go to the doctors” that will help you to filter things that do and don’t matter more easily.\n\nFinally:\n\n\n*Oh and I am not a medical professional and nothing I’ve written is medical advice. You should listen to what your doctor tells you*.... which I am guessing is that you have anxiety, which is why you’re on here searching for answers. You won’t find them here, nor will you find anything wrong with you!\n\nGo and enjoy your life, go socialise, make a stand, like I said I don’t have anxiety anymore, I stopped one day and said fuck this, I’m choosing to not have this anymore and it’s gone, it’s a state of mind and you can control your own brain IF TOU CHOOSE TOO!\n\nIf you want anything or someone to talk too message me. I’ve not been anxious for at least 2 months now.\n\n\n————————————————————————————————————————————————————\n\n\n**Edit:It's now been 6 months since I posted this, I consider my HA to be gone now, I default to the 'normal' rational thought process that everyone else uses. Honestly stop googling and start living.**\n\n\n3 year update.\n\nWow where did that time go?\n\nLife has never been better. I don’t panic about my health, I don’t obsess or check things, I don’t google, I accept I will one day die, I don’t stress about it because what will be will be, I accept that of the 100s of times I have worried in the past so far 0 of them have been a cause for concern, I no longer stress myself out about my health.\n\nI live. It’s that simple.\n\nGood luck everyone, you can take control and move on with your life, it really is in your hands, no one will do it for you.\n\n❤️",

    "selftext": "Can do to the body sorry for spelling error\n\nSo anxiety can make you feel like your dying we all know that. These symptoms also can last along time or a short time depends how stress you are and if you still are and have those obsessive thoughts. Anxiety is evil and we all wish it to disappear. I’m here to tell you guys what anxiety can do physically and mentally \n\nIt can do so much physically \n\nIt can cause Weakness of the body and it can affect one side, one limb, or the whole entire body\n\nIt can make muscle twitches and muscle spams happen anywhere. Even in places that don’t have muscles and they can last along time sadly.\n\nIt can cause burning, numbness, buzzing, zapping, vibrating, and other strange feeling that aren’t normal.\n\nIt can give you headaches and migraines that can last for days and weeks long.\n\nIt can make you feel like you have a shortness of breath or feel like it is hard to breathe.\n\nIt can make you heart beat faster and make you chest hurt from it and also cause palpitations.\n\nIt can make you nauseous and vomit.\n\nIt can make your stomach hurt and feel like your being punched from the inside.\n\nIt can make you have changes in bowel movements like constipation and diarrhea.\n\nIt can make you loose appetite or make you have more of a appetite.

Also could cause you to have a weak stream or make it hard to be in general.\n\nIt can cause blurry vision, floaters, tunnel vision, sometimes double vision, and other vision changes.\n\nIt can make you feel lightheaded and dizzy more often. Especially after standing up to quickly.\n\nYou can get dry mouth during this as well.\n\nYou can have trouble speaking like mumbling, stuttering, keep saying words over , and many other speech problems.\n\nIt can cause warm or cold rushes in the body and affect any part.\n\nIt can make your hair fallout easier.\n\nIt can cause a choking feeling in your throat, sore throat, can make it feel like a lump, and also other throat related problems.\n\nIt can make you body ache all over. From joint pain to just random leg pain. Also back pain and neck pain and also jaw pain. This can last for weeks or even longer.\n\nMake you body feel fatigued like you can’t even open a water bottle or go up a flight a stairs.\n\nIt Can cause joints to pop more. \n\nIt Can make you get tremors or shake randomly.\n\nIt can make you head feel weird sensation like a zipping feeling and it can be anywhere on the head \n\nIt Can make movements feel not like your own like your leg is drifting is a pretty common one.\n\nMake you more light sensitive as well.\n\nYou can get ear pressure, pain, and get tinnitus from stress.\n\nIt can do a lot Mentally as well\n\nMake you feel depressed and depression has a lot of symptoms to like aches and headaches as well.\n\nCan make you more forgetful like what was I just doing but that is pretty common today anyways.\n\nMake you not want to get up and take a shower.\n\nIt can make you see things that aren’t there or just like out of the corner of your eye.\n\nCan make you see weird patterns and lighting blots but if you do tell doctors about it this one.\n\nMakes you feel like you not in your body and you can see yourself.

Like someone’s voice or just a weird sound.\n\nThat all I can remember for now if I can think of anymore I’ll let you know. Remember that anxiety can pretty much do anything to the body and it is very aggravating and can make you feel like you have a serious condition. If you guys have anymore symptoms comment them bellow. Remember and try to stick with the facts that some diseases we are afraid of are very rare and try to avoid the what if.\n\nDo not google anything you experience it pops up with the worst. Just googling muscle weakness is mind destroying and scary and they always put the worst first. If you guys ever feel alone or scared you can dm me I am happy to help.\n\nEdit: thanks to someone in the comments the pointed out a mistake I made.\n\nYou can also get coldness it your fingers and toes.\n\nYou can also grind your teeth in your sleep causing tmj but that is easily treatable and in most cases fix themselves \n\nAlso can make you have nightmares and dream a lot more even if the dreams don’t make sense and are random.\n\nIt also can cause night sweats\n\nIt increases the acid production in stomach which causes indigestion, heartburn, stomach uncomfortness.\n\nIt impacts on the balance of good and bad bacteria in gut.\n\nIt causes stomach gas even if you eat the right food.\n\nIt inputs alot in existing problem like IBS.\n\nAlso you can feel your heartbeat in the ears and feel it anywhere on the body.\n\nEdit: These are symptoms of anxiety not a diagnosis but if your going through a troubling time and have been under a lot of stress and anxiety then these can relate but if they come out of no where not scared at all. Setup a visit with your gp and still there might be nothing wrong. It is ok to not feel good sometimes doesn’t mean you are dying of a terrible illness.\n\nAlso don’t be afraid to ask a gp even while you are stress. They will help a lot and if they don’t they aren’t a good gp,",

I had x rays, went to the doctors multiple times, and I was also given the all clear simply because its just anxiety. \n\nYou’re not going to stop breathing and you’re not going to fall down and die. If you are young and healthy especially, you have nothing to fear. \n\nDISCLAIMER - obviously if your symptoms are extreme and you are experiencing this frequently, go to a doctor and get checked out.

Many of us tell ourselves that we’ll move on from our anxiety once we get that “one more test” or that “one last doctor visit”. But the truth is we get that reassurance one more time, and it’s never enough. You’ll either worry that they missed something or worry about a new symptom. It is impossible to recover until you begin to live your life again, despite the symptoms. You HAVE to take that trip you’ve been dreading. You HAVE to go back to work and start making a career. You HAVE to start exercising, eating right, meditating, and seeing a mental health professional. And above all, you HAVE to be patient. One therapy session will not cure you, nor will one jog, or one healthy dinner. It can take MONTHS, if not years to get better. But don’t let this discourage you. I promise you, when you recover, you will be the strongest form of yourself you ever have been. You will be able to take on anything life throws at you, and you will never take anything for granted anymore. You will love, laugh, and live in ways you never thought possible. And when that day finally comes that you have to leave this earth, you will look back and be so proud. Your health anxiety wasn’t a curse. It was a message for you to become stronger. It was an opportunity. So seize it and put in the work, you’ll thank yourself later...\n\nEDIT: I’m glad this post has helped a lot of you. As a community it’s important for all of us to remind each other to take a step forward in our anxiety",

Reassurance will only give you temporary relief and as you get use to doing the same habit your anxiety will only get worse. If you truly want to heal you'll need to get use to not fearing your discomfort. There's a couple books that have tremendously helped me on a road to recovery. I recommend reading:\n\nDARE by Barry McDonagh\n\nand\n\nFuck Coping Start Healing by Dennis Simsek\n\nEdit: Also, I get it, I was there and sometimes still am. I'd come here relieved to see others are going through the same thing. Then I noticed a pattern where I would constantly come back for the same sensation or a new sensation. It never ended and with each visit I noticed I could no longer be reassured as well as the last visit.\n\nYou might notice this pattern in-person as well where you ask your spouse, sibling or friend if they feel these things too. Part of healing anxiety is about building trust with your mind and body. I am still recovering but I see light at the end of the tunnel. This thing can be beat but you have to start with cutting the habit of always trying to seek reassurance. Obviously get things checked out but learn to trust the healthy result when it's received.",

Gas/digestive issues WILL cause sudden bursts of adrenaline (that nervous feeling in your stomach that shoots down your arms and legs too), I have no idea why, but this happens to me constantly and it ALWAYS turns out to be a really bad fart, lol. Gas will cause pain literally anywhere too. Especially in your chest (left, right, center), abdomen, rib area, etc.  Gas WILL a feel like pressure or tightness in your stomach, abdomen, or chest. gas pain will feel sharp, dull, achy, etc.\n\nREMEMBER, heart related pain is usually located in center of chest and feels heavy and deep. Your heart does NOT speed up when having a HA. It actually slows down due to the blockage. \n\nThis information has helped me calm down immensely with heart anxiety. Hopefully it helps you too.",

    "selftext": "I have horrible health anxiety and hypochondria. Any little change or blemish I freak out and turn to doctor google. As we know doctor google is not for people like us lol.\n\nBack in March I suffered with some throat infection and a few weeks later in the shower I noticed a pretty decent bump in my right neck. Of course I freaked out for a moment as google told me it’s a lymph node and I have some form of cancer or STD. Of course google also said to just see if it goes down/gets bigger and not to jump the gun.\n\nI have spent the last couple months googling the same things over and over again and during that time I kept pushing and poking the lymph node literally every 5 seconds I would touch it. Didn’t matter if I was driving, working, watching a movie or cooking I had my hand on that spot.\n\nI then started to do neck inspections, I would run my hands along my neck and I started to even dig in my collarbone(really rough also). Months after the first lymph node I found a tiny pea sized one at the bottom of my right neck and again freaked out.\n\nThen a few months after that I found another pea sized at the top of my left neck and then a month ago I was digging in my collarbone and I hurt myself and then days later found a HUGE rock hard lymph node.\n\nThis all sent me into a horrible panic, I was convinced I had lymphoma or some form of cancer. Convinced myself it was metastatic cancer from somewhere else.\n\nAs I did with my original lymph node, I started poking and pinching these lymph nodes and continued googling and freaking out.\n\nI never went to the doctor because I’m those types of hypochondriac where I won’t go to the doctor, I’ll just diagnose myself and cry about it.\n\nWell, low and behold when I stop touching them, they instantly go down. The original one on my neck was almost completely gone but I started touching it again and it would flare up. Now my nodes never got huge and they have only decreased in size. Even the rock hard one in my collarbone is almost completely gone.\n\nI spoke with a doctor and they told me that our bodies are amazing, they will fight viruses and illnesses and we won’t even know and these lymph nodes are just doing their jobs and if they get inflamed they may never go back down fully and will swell up again if we get sick.\n\nMy advice to everyone I see posting about lymph nodes, go to the doctor for your peace of mind but DON’T play with them, I am confirmation that if you play with them and hurt them they can’t heal. Don’t google and don’t diagnose.\n\nGo to the doctor when worried but also know that our bodies are keeping us healthy and just because you notice something different doesn’t mean we are dying.\n\nI am still learning this myself and I still google things but I know it’s reassuring to hear from people that have similar skin/body issues that turn out to be normal and not worst case scenario.\n\nI’m here to talk with anyone that needs it :)",

    "selftext": "Today I remembered something that helped me and I thought I would share. I hesitate to call it advice because it’s so simple but it has helped me today with the struggle so I thought it may be worth sharing. \n\n\nA few years ago I was deep in the trenches of health anxiety. I would Google symptoms, truly, 12 hours a day. One night I was cooking and suddenly had a bunch of concerning symptoms that I won’t get into and called 911 and told them I was having a heart attack. I laid down on the floor and texted me family goodbye. I must have really sold it on the phone because two fire trucks worth of firefighters and two paramedics stormed my apartment and put me on a stretcher. They did all the tests and then just as quickly filtered out until just one paramedic was left. He was probably in his mid 70’s. I was sure it was because I was too far gone to save but no. He quietly asked me if I had a history of panic attacks. I was so embarrassed. I burst into tears and confessed and he shared with me that his granddaughter had similar struggles. He told me to always remember a couple things, which I have noted below to the best of my recollection. \n\n\nFirst, it is almost never the worst case scenario. When you’re googling, you can almost always eliminate the worst diagnosis. Second, the things you see on the news are outliers and you never get the full story of someone’s health history or habits. When you see something like, “Healthy 32 year old drops dead after _____.”You can’t rest assured you don’t have the whole picture. \n\n\nIt’s so simple and probable that everyone else already knows this but if it helps one person like it has me it was worth posting. \n\nEdit: So shocked and thankful for the awards. I was certain everyone was going to think it was old/obvious news. Encouraging to me that it helps others and giving me strength to keep going! \n\nHang in there y’all.",

If you're struggling right now, here's something that really helps me sometimes.\n\nMost of the things we're worried about almost always have EXTREMELY dramatic symptoms.\n\nLike, a heart attack, which is literally when your heart can't get fucking BLOOD, is not gonna have symptoms like, \"Oof ouch my chest is a little sore\". Fuck no. Its gonna be like, \"DAH SHIT DUDE MY CHEST IS LITERALLY GONNA EXPLODE AND NOW THERES A GODDAMN ELEPHANT ON MY CHEST\" If something wrong, its gonna make itself clear.\n\nAnother example, brain tumor, where a chunk of cells is disrupting function of YOUR FUCKING BRAIN, is not gonna have symptoms along the lines of, \"Man my head hurts a little, and it'll probably go away when I sleep it off.\" It'll be more like, \"FUCK MY HEAD HURTS. WOAH IM BARFING A LOT RECENTLY. OH GOD I CANT WALK IN A STRAIGHT LINE WITHOUT DYING.\" Which at that point, you should already know to go to the doctor. Brain aneurysm basically falls under this category too.\n\n\nHow about another example, as this is pretty fun. Sepsis. Your body is fucking dying. It's not a, \"Well I feel more tired than usual.

    "title": "How I survived lymphoma, 3 brain tumors, HIV, AIDS, countless blood clots, and heart failure.",
    "selftext": "About six years ago I was diagnosed with Hodgkin's Lymphoma. I battled it for several weeks before I was finally cured. This was my first encounter with a terminal illness, at the age of 15.\n\nI was healthy for a long time. Everything was great, until I discovered I had a brain tumor. I didn't have headaches often, but this one could only have one explanation. I knew I only had a few months left to live. Miraculously, my tumor atrophied over the course of a week and completely disappeared. I felt normal again.\n\nThings were great. I was a new person. Until I contracted HIV. I knew it the second it happened. I won't go into details about the event that led to this, but what else could explain the enlarged lymph nodes about a week later? And then the fever and night sweats. Every symptom of a new HIV infection listed on Wikipedia fit perfectly, except for the ones that didn't.\n\nThis was the first major disease I had that lasted more than a month. In fact, it lasted over half a year.\n\nI purchased my first HIV test kit 16 days after the initial infection. I knew that the detection window was usually 4-6 weeks after the initial exposure, but I religiously adhere to the mantra of \"Better safe than sorry\". Of course, this test came back negative, but I already expected that.\n\nI was able to wait another 2 weeks, at which time I immediately purchased a test kit two-pack. $58 for two tests was a better deal than $37 for one, and hey, I need to start buying in bulk if I want to test myself as often as my brain tells me I should.\n\nTest 2 came back negative, but let's be honest, only 75% of people infected will test positive 4 weeks after exposure. I figure that since my immune system was naturally already so weak (I get a cold maybe once every year or two), I would probably take a bit longer to test positive.\n\nI used the second test at 6 weeks, which is around the 90% accuracy mark. Negative. I've always been unique.\n\nEight weeks and 4 tests in, and it finally happened. As I sat and waited the 20 minutes for the test results, I broke into a cold sweat. I already knew the answer, and by the time I flipped over the test swab, I had already accepted my fate. Negative. Fuck, JUST BE POSITIVE ALREADY SO I CAN MOVE ON WITH MY LIFE!\n\nAlright, alright. Not to worry. I'm still only in the 96% accuracy window. That's 4 people out of 100 that get a false negative. 2 out of 50. 1 out of 25. I'm way more unique than 1 out of 25. I'm like 1 in a billion. 1 billion times 1 out of 25 is like 40,000,000, which means I must have HIV, right??\n\nI accepted my diagnosis, even though the damned test kits kept lying to me. I didn't really need their confirmation to live like a sick dying person. Heck, I was really good at living like a sick dying person all on my own. I had plenty of experience with it, having already survived 2 terminal illnesses to this point.\n\nI wallowed in self pity for another two months before the panic started to come back. I was beginning to feel a bit sick. Sore throat, runny nose... uh oh. I knew what that meant. AIDS was setting in, and I had just developed an opportunistic infection. My immune system was probably already compromised even before I got HIV, which is why the tests kept coming back negative. I mean, I don't have a scientific source for this, but if you have no immune system in the first place, then you're not going to develop any antibodies to HIV when you contract it. And since the HIV test I had used detected the presence of antibodies and not the virus itself, that's why the tests weren't coming back positive.\n\nAs I lay on my deathbed, I gave in and dropped another $60 on two more test kits, bringing my total up to 6. I wasn't going to need the money when I was dead, after all. I took the first one 4 months after the initial infection, and it came back negative, not to my surprise. This was more of an addiction than anything now, I didn't really care about the result so much as the process.\n\n2 months later, my AIDS had subsided a bit. I took the second test for shits and giggles, and it came back... negative.\n\nI felt like I had been trapped on a roller coaster for the past 6 months. I had developed severe generalized anxiety alongside my HIV/AIDS infection, to the point where I couldn't even drive to the grocery store without having an all-out panic attack.\n\nThen things got better. I told myself that I could beat this disease, I just needed to take care of myself. I started eating healthier, forcing myself onto a better sleep schedule, and even moderately exercising. Then, something amazing happened. My AIDS started to rapidly subside. Within a week I had regressed from terminal AIDS patient to a run-of-the-mill HIV patient. But I was able to cure myself of the HIV, too. All in all, two weeks after I set my mind to it, I had beaten this debilitating disease to a pulp.\n\nI felt amazing, for the first time in over a year. I had a new life, new possibilities, new energy and drive. I was going to conquer my dreams now, no longer my illnesses. And I did pretty damned good, until I discovered that I had a congenital heart defect.\n\nYou know the story from there. I sunk down, down, down. Then I saw a doctor, had a battery of tests, was told I was healthy as an ox, and began to rebound.\n\nHere I am today, 3 months after surviving the heart disease. \n\nThis week, I learned I have MS. I am not looking forward to this fight, but I have confidence that I can beat this disease's ass too.\n\nToday, I was diagnosed with another disorder as well. It's called health anxiety, and this is the one I'm not going to fuck around with. Overall, it is one of the most debilitating diseases imaginable. It can turn a person with boundless potential into a sickly shell of their former selves.\n\nAnd the worst part?\n\n**This one is not imaginary.**",

    "title": "My Experience Overcoming Crippling Health Anxiety + Tips",
    "selftext": "This post is about my experience with health anxiety and how I totally overcame it. I hope this can help someone out there going through probably the most scary time of their life.\n\n\n**The Beginning**\n\nA year and a half ago I developed the symptoms of dry eye syndrome (light sensitivity, trouble reading). Otherwise, I was a totally healthy 21 year old male. When I shared the symptoms with a relative, she convinced me it must be something terrible like diabetes or MS. Rather than immediately consult a doctor, I spent the next couple of weeks Googling symptoms. \n\nSure enough, a few days after first reading the symptoms of MS, my left leg started to become relentlessly tense. One night, my leg continually tensed up every couple of minutes and made it impossible to sleep. When I finally got out of bed in the morning, I went to take a shower. In the hot shower, my head started to feel hot and I suddenly felt very nauseous. I ran over to the sink and dry heaved, and then my vision started to fade to black. After sitting down on the floor, my vision slowly came back - but I was already convinced something was seriously wrong with me.\n\nWent to the E.R. - all tests came back clear and they sent me home. They didn't know what caused it, but said that sometimes it \"just happens.\" In the back of my mind, I already \"knew\" that something was wrong with me and continued to Google symptoms to try and solve my own case. Over that next month, I went back to the emergency room 4 times, had an ambulance come to my house, and spent a night in the hospital. The time the ambulance came to my house, both of my arms had gone completely numb (from hyperventilation during a panic attack) and I was convinced I was going to die. I vividly remember the nurse asking me \"on a scale of 1/10, how much pain are you in?\" and I answered, \"I'm not in any pain - I just feel like I'm about to die.\"\n\nAs far as I could tell, my body was being controlled by a mysterious illness that could suddenly onset at any time and make me feel like I was about to pass out. Every time I went to the emergency room I said basically the same thing: \"I feel light headed, like I'm going to pass out.\" Only, of course, they knew that wasn't really what was happening because my blood pressure was always just fine. Unfortunately, no one really conveyed this to me.\n\nI developed a severe case of agoraphobia. I went from being an independent adult male to sleeping in the same bed as my safe person again because I was so scared something was going to happen to me in my sleep. Because this all started with me passing out in the shower, I became deathly afraid of the shower. I didn't shower for almost two months. I couldn't really leave the house at all, and if I had to, I had to stay near my safe person at all times - I couldn't do something as simple as sit alone in a store. Even just walking into the store made me feel a strong, sudden wave of anxiety.\n\n**Turning The Corner**\n\nDuring my four emergency room visits and hospital stay, I had an unbelievable amount of tests done. I got two CT scans of my head, two chest xrays, an MRI, a heart echo, a stress test, about 20 blood tests, a 24 hour heart monitor, as well as many other tests. All came back negative, and oddly enough *not one doctor ever mentioned the possibility that it could just be anxiety*. I had to figure this out on my own.\n\nThe exact instant I realized I had health anxiety was when I finally realized that I could actually trigger my symptoms. For example, every time I would go to a doctor's appointment, I felt like I was going to pass out. This happened whether it was an appointment with my primary care physician or my ophthalmologist. I literally had to lay down in the waiting room of my ophthalmologist because I just felt so light headed when I would go there. But then, oddly enough, I noticed that the symptoms totally subsided on the way home every time. It seems almost impossible to not put two and two together here, but it took me months to realize that perhaps it was anxiety causing me to experience these symptoms and that this would explain why they onset right before going to a doctor's appointment. At this point, after Googling, I came across \"white coat syndrome,\" and I knew what I had.\n\nI told my neurologist I thought it may just be anxiety. He said it was possible, but he wanted to run some more tests. I let him run the tests, but in the meantime I started to treat the anxiety on my own with lifestyle changes. I started going out for strenuous walks for thirty minutes a day as a form of exercise even though my heart felt like it was palpitating out of my chest and I was scared to death. I started forcing myself to do things on my own. The first thing I did on my own was stand in line without my \"safe person\" to get my allergy medication prescription at a pharmacy - I felt strongly like I was going to pass out and desperately wanted to go sit down, but the book I read said the only way I could treat the anxiety was to face the fear and try and force myself to pass out. Of course, I never did pass out - it was all in my head.\n\nAfter just about a month of self care, my extreme agoraphobia was gone. I was taking showers again once a day and I was going out and doing things completely by myself. A few months later, I got an opportunity to take my treatment to the next level - move across the country to live with a friend for a couple of months. I took the opportunity to finally break away from my safe person all together, and it turned out to be the final piece. The remaining minor symptoms I had dissipated.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThis is a heavily condensed version of my story - it would be nearly impossible to go into full detail, as this took place over a grueling 8-9 months. I would, however, like to list some of the symptoms I experienced that totally went away. I think this could be helpful to someone who has some of these symptoms and has been told its anxiety, but doesn't quite believe it or think they will go away. Don't get me wrong, if you have any of these symptoms and you haven't been checked out, you need to do that first. Until you remove that piece of doubt from your mind, your recovery will be much harder.\n\n**Symptoms I experienced at one point or another that are now totally gone**\n\n* Panic attacks (4 E.R. visits in a month, 1 ambulance call. sensations of abnormal heart beat, sweating, arms going numb, hyperventilation)\n* Extremely tense, painful left leg (this happened for weeks at a time, caused by stress according to neurologist)\n* Constant eye twitching (not like tourettes, but rather a constant twitching sensation in the eyelid)\n* Sensation of abnormal heartbeat (I was obsessed with my heartbeat and convinced something was wrong with it, I could notice it at almost all times)\n* Feeling of not getting enough air in (this was a strong sensation I often had around bed time, I literally felt like I was just not breathing in enough air to survive)\n* Trying to control my breathing (this was one of the most frustrating symptoms - I could not seem to take my mind off of controlling my breathing, I found a simple cure for this in the section below)\n* Ringing in the ears (sometimes it was constant for days at a time, sometimes it was one of my ears suddenly \"going out\" for a few minutes)\n* Seeing things (shapes, colors, etc) when my eyes were closed (this is one of the weirdest ones, because at the time it greatly concerned me and I remember always paying attention to what I could see with my eyes closed, and now I can't even remember what they looked like or ever paying attention to that again)\n* Feeling of light-headedness (pretty self explanatory, very common in anxiety)\n* Arms going numb (this would happen any time I was in a stressful situation, for example before a doctor's appointment or even when I went and played poker a couple of months after I had mostly recovered and even then every time I bluffed my arms would start to tingle and eventually go borderline numb - was told this has to do with the adrenaline overloading my system 24/7)\n* Constantly feeling off balance, like the floor is a bouncy castle (I went to the doctor specifically for this issue as well, and he checked my ears and assured me this sensation was all in my head - and it turns out it was. Was a very freaky thing, I was literally having to lean on the countertops in the kitchen just to wash dishes at one point, and now it is totally gone).\n* Derealization (I would constantly get the sensation that my arms weren't really my arms, or that I couldn't feel my face - I would literally pinch my arms every few minutes just to make sure they were mine and that I could feel them).\n* Developed an extreme sensitivity to caffeine (used to drink 400+mg in the morning, now I couldn't even drink a cup of coffee without feeling sick to my stomach, doctor told me to quit altogether so I tapered off until I quit)\n* Constantly lifting my arms, smiling due to fear of having a stroke (since one time the doctor mentioned I may of had a minor stroke, I became obsessed with lifting my arms to make sure one wasn't weaker than the other and smiling to make sure my face wasn't drooping)\n* The list goes on and on. Much of the stuff I am no doubt forgetting.\n\n**Tips**\n\n* Start an exercise program. Much of anxiety is simply excess energy that needs to get expended. It's much harder to be anxious when you are tired, and besides if you have anxiety related to your heartbeat this is a way to face that. The first few days I was convinced my heart was beating like crazy just when walking, but the more you do it the less it happens and eventually it goes away all together. The goal is to desensitize yourself from focusing on your heart beat.\n* ALWAYS face your fears. Every time you give in to anxiety, it grows a little bit. Every time you face it, it shrinks a little bit. This is the basis of all treatment for anxiety. Anxiety makes you uncomfortable, but it is not harmful. The goal is to recognize that it is purely discomfort and there is really nothing to be afraid of.\n* For dealing specifically with the focusing on breathing thing, I recommend a great article [here](https://iocdf.org/expert-opinions/when-automatic-bodily-processes-become-conscious-how-to-disengage-from-sensorimotor-obsessions/). This article literally single handedly cured this symptom, and this is the one that I experienced the longest of all of them. Even after everything was gone, I could not seem to stop focusing on my breathing. The gist of the article is that you are doing this because you are scared of the thought of focusing on your breathing, you are scared by the idea that you cannot stop, and so your brain keeps paying attention because your brain loves scary things. So in sense, make paying attention to your breathing as boring as possible. Set alarms throughout the day to remind you to pay attention to your breathing - seems counter intuitive, but WOW does it actually work.\n* Read as much literature as you can from well reputed sources on health anxiety and panic attacks. I recommend especially D.A.R.E, but I would also simply recommend watching [this short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_mFzOudxng&t=245s). I also used an anxiety/phobia/panic attack workbook that helped a lot, although I cannot remember the name of it now.\n* Never, EVER google symptoms. Ever. Not because you should be scared by what you find, because you shouldn't, but because you aren't smart enough to recognize that you shouldn't be scared. If everyone could take their findings with a grain of salt and recognize that they have no idea what they are doing and should draw no conclusions from what they find, there would be no issue. But everyone thinks of themselves as smart and competent, and so they think they are likely to come up with accurate conclusions. WRONG. Even people who know the relevant biology and anatomy can't properly dissect a medical journal - and you think you can do it as a layman? Doctors understand things about frequencies and qualifying characteristics for diagnoses that none of us will ever understand and can't be found in a quick google search. Please leave anything medically related up to the professionals at all times.\n* Considering taking a calcium + magnesium + zinc supplement. Recommended by many resources for dealing with anxiety.\n* You should probably quit caffeine. I was the biggest coffee head you can imagine, and even though I was forced to quit by an extreme sensitivity to caffeine I developed, I probably would of quit anyway. Life is much better without it anyways - it's hard to imagine why I ever needed it in the first place at this point. Now I just wake up and feel great, not like i need a cup of coffee immediately. Copious amounts of decaf satisfy my requirements for the taste of black coffee.\n\nI don't really use Reddit very often, so I don't plan on \"sticking around\" the community to help people or anything. I just wanted to make my one big contribution and give back the best way I could - by creating a post I think will help someone out there, and I wanted to do it before it was too late and I've moved on so far that I totally forget the details of this thing that happened to me. Best of luck to all of you - life is really great when you don't think you are dying all of the time!",

Let's think about the harsh conditions - weather, starvation, injury, lack of medicine, lack of clean water - that the cavemen endured. Let's think about these same harsh conditions that millions of humans still endure today in undeveloped nations. Let's think about the incredible survival stories we've all heard - someone surviving in the wilderness for years, someone surviving a horrible animal attack or car accident or plane crash, someone overcoming a terminal illness. \n\nWhen we sit around in our clean, tidy, organized first-world countries, it's easy to forget what generations upon generations of humans have gone through to get us to this point. The human body has adapted and evolved to be able to survive some of the harshest conditions on this planet. Extreme heat, extreme cold, starvation, dehydration, infection, broken bones, open wounds. It is an incredibly intelligent machine, with hundreds of built-in mechanisms to course-correct if something is thrown off-balance. And most of us have such advantages today as access to clean water, consistent food, and medical care, which haven't been readily available for the majority of human existence.\n\nSo no, that paper cut isn't going to give you sepsis.

It starts to sound silly the more you think about it.\n\nNext time you are worried about a symptom, remember just how strong you really are. Remember how much the human body can survive. Remember that you are equipped with the same incredible biological machinery as generations before you, who endured far worse than you ever will.",

Why?\n\nLet's start with the big one. The truly scary thing. The worst thing.\n\nHowever, if you read on, you have to promise me that you will stop googling. You and I both know that google is like a magic history searcher, able to search through all of history to find exactly the thing you're worried about. I'm sure a meteor hit someone in the past 30 years. But when you google \"meteor kills young person\" and you get results, you go OH GOD ITS COMING FOR MEEEE. Nope.\n\nLet's go.\n\n===\n\n1. **Myth: rabies is 100% fatal**\n\n**Fact: Rabies is 100% fatal when not treated at all.** Notice that I **don't** say the normal thing that google says about it \"being fatal when symptoms show up\". Why? Because **this is** ***not true***. There are **THREE** cases of a time where the \"Milwaukee protocol\" saved peoples' lives AFTER they began showing symptoms. It involves putting you into a medically induced coma so deep that the virus thinks you're dead. It worked 3 out of 35 times it was applied.  (Edit: There are apparently 29 survivors of rabies according to a study I read yesterday!) anyway, you might say wow that's a horrible chance of survival, but the point is to get you to realize that ***you're afraid of rabies because you were told there's a 100% death rate***, **not because you think it'll actually happen to you**. There are plenty of other scary diseases, but when it comes to rabies, all rationality goes out the window because of the idea of a 100 percent death rate. Well, we just lowered it by 11%. There are other things that have a \\~10% survival rate that you aren't as scared of. Even if you get it AND show symptoms, if the milwaukee protocol is initiated, then you have an 11% chance of survival. Oh, what's that? That still sounds bad? Well, listen to this:\n\n**2. Myth: The milwaukee protocol doesn't work; it's just a red herring. Doctors say it doesn't work. :(**\n\n**Fact: the doctor who took care of the first patient to survive actually told sources that the other doctors were using the wrong drugs.** The doctor recommended two specific drugs for the coma, and yet the other doctors didn't use them. Therefore, the other doctors violated this protocol - so no wonder it didn't work! If the milwaukee protocol is done correctly (with ketamine and some other drug I forget the name of) it has a greater chance of working. How much greater? Not sure, but it worked for at least one person. In fact, the protocol in general worked for three out of thirty five. \"One person? Oh so it won't be me.\" Now think of all those times that your health anxiety says \"oh but what if im that ONE person...\" when it's something bad? what about now? What if you were to be that ONE person who did survive the milwaukee protocol? (again, there are **three** already who did, and the ones who died were assumedly using the wrong medicine!)\n\n3. **Myth: if I touch a bat I will get rabies.**\n\n**Fact: No, no, no.** My goodness, people. I see some people say on OCD forums that they **SAW** a bat and they were worried they got it. No, the virus doesn't have magical powers and can infect you through sight like those creepy things in Bird Box. You need to get SPIT from a rabid animal inside of you - through a break in the skin or a mucus membrane. Non-bite transmissions are so rare they're almost nonexistent. In fact, I even read an article saying you could literally pet a rabid bat and be fine lol. The CDC says you can't get it from petting a rabid animal.\n\n4. **Myth: Okay, fine then, well if a rabid bat spits on me in the mucus membrane or bites me I will get rabies for sure especially if it's showing symptoms!**\n\n**Fact: This one is probably the most surprising, but** ***no***. It's actually not guaranteed. The rabies virus is present in salivary glands once symptoms are showing, HOWEVER, it actually isn't constant. They say that it can be exhibiting symptoms and yet have no virus particles in its spit. How interesting, right? It tends to come in waves, so you might even have spit with 0 rabies in it, despite the drooling and biting.\n\n4. **Myth: I shouldn't touch anything outside in case a rabid animal used it!**\n\n**Fact: nope, sorry. Rabies virus is killed by sunlight. Also, dried surfaces propose 0 risk according to the CDC.** There is no risk of transmission from dried surfaces, especially in the daytime.\n\n5. **Myth: I got bit by a cat/dog/parrot/etc and now I'm scared I have it!!! I NEED TEH SHOTS NOWWWWW!!!!**\n\n**Fact: Noperino.** First off the virus isn't transferred by birds, so ignore that one. But for cats and dogs, you can quarantine the animal. If the animal is alive after 10 days and not showing any symptoms of rabies, then that animal was not infectious at the time of biting you.\n\nThis works well for exposures outside - lets say your neighbor's dog bites you and you get REALLY scared about rabies. Well, just wait 10 days! Is the animal still alive and looks about the same as they did when they bit you? Then you're fine, no rabies.\n\n===\n\nNow, here's the thing... In regards to sources, I'm not even sure if I should link them. You guys will just go to read them because you're so scared and you'll eventually find something that says \"oh but this may be because of a different reasons because one person suggested it might not be true\" and it will just start the cycle over again despite there being evidence to the contrary. Let me know if I can help.\n\nI hope this helps put your mind at ease.",

    "title": "Tips for heart palpitations",
    "selftext": "*IM NOT A DOCTOR, so only read further IF YOU'VE BEEN CHECKED OUT BY YOUR DOCTOR AND TOLD YOU'RE HEALTHY* \n\nA bit of backstory:\n\nI’ve had heart palpitations on and off since 2015, they began a few months before I had to move countries on my own for university and leave everything and everyone behind. \n\nFor my palpitations, they always felt more like a sinking feeling. I could best describe it as: \n\n- when you’re in one of those slow moving elevators and it’s the feeling you get in your stomach/chest when the elevator stops agonisingly slowly. I know, very specific.\n- when a plane first lifts off and you can feel it in your whole body that you’re suddenly no longer touching the ground.\n- when something jumps in front of you and your heart “sinks in your stomach”.\n\nSo you can guess I had a fun time explaining the above feelings to not one or two doctors. The looks I’ve got were amazing. \n\nAfter being checked by multiple doctors in two countries, they never ever found anything. Blood tests, ambulance called, EKG, more recently an X-RAY . Pretty sure the only thing I haven’t had was a 24hour heart monitor, because as I’m 22 and doctors never found anything, no one was concerned enough to set me up with one. \nMy mom always calms me down with \"one doctor could be mistaken, but 7+ can't all make the same mistake so you just gotta trust them!\"\n\nA few months ago I had a full week of palpitations. Seven days exactly. And they stopped just as sudden as they started. One day I was fine, the other day I was having a palpitation every few minutes and in seven days they stopped. I went to the emergency room as I was having a palpitation literally every 4-5 minutes, sometimes more. And a few things happened at the emergency:\n\n1. I had a palpitation while connected to a heart monitor.\n2. The doctor could not see it when checking the printout version of my heart rhythm. (not sure of the proper naming of it, but it’s that long piece of paper with your heart rhythm on it) \n\nI was amazed, how could I have a palpitation and for it to not be visible? \n\nAs it turns out, women can have palpitations based on hormone activity that are considered so tiny and so normal that are basically not detected by heart monitors, but if the woman is highly sensitive or suffering from health anxiety she’s more prone to feeling it. Imagine feeling a palpitation when even ECG cannot recognise it as such. \n\nSo I just wanted to share some things and possibly help:\n\n1. Heart palpitations in women can very often be a hormone change such as period, ovulation or sometimes as simple as pms. \n2. As everyone has said before, caffeine is a big no if you’re suffering from palpitations. But also chocolate and foods high in sugar. If I’m having palpitations and I’ve been eating too much sugar I take it as my body saying stop it now. \n3. W A T E R. I cannot possibly stress it enough! The amount of palpitations I’ve had that were solely because I was dehydrated.... I always carry a water bottle with me now and when I’m experiencing palpitations I drink even more than usual because it makes not only my heart but my body work better.\n4. Being too hot can also cause palpitations - after a hot shower or wearing too much clothes.\n5. The Vagus Nerve. Its a nerve connecting your stomach and your brain that passes right next to the heart and can cause palpitations if the stomach is dealing with overeating, too heavy food, too spicy etc. This video explains it in detail -> https://youtu.be/yvJ7KNIgGQ4\n6. And most importantly - If it causes you panic - ITS NOT A   HEART ATTACK. I’ve spoken with quite a few people that has survived heart attacks and they all said the same - they were not panicking when it happened. They were worried but their bodies literally could not panic as it was a life and death situation and they had to be sane enough to reach for help and survive. So if you panic, it’s just a sign it’s safe and you’ll be fine.\n\nHope all of this helps at least a bit. You’re not alone and it’s gonna be okay ❤️\n\n*EDIT*\nThank you for the gold! I'm fairly new here so I'm not sure what exactly does it mean but it must be good haha! 💗 I forgot to mention one more additional reason behind palpitations so I'm including it above:",

    "selftext": "Hello fellow health anxiety sufferers! I have such an intense fear of death and fear of cancer/terminal illness. My health anxiety has been spiking so much that all of my recommended YouTube videos are cancer patients and terminally ill patients. I just don’t understand why I’m like this. Cancer seems so common nowadays. Is it really this common? I’m sitting in bed having a panic attack thinking those patients will be me sometime soon. Instead of feeling sorry for them I’m panicking about my healthy self. How do you guys deal with these awful waves of fear? If anyone can talk to me right now that would be amazing.. I’m in such a bad state at the moment and my brain keeps telling me something is wrong with me health wise.. if someone who relates and goes through this can talk to me and help ease my anxiety right now that would be so amazing.",

    "title": "Lets discuss ✨rabies✨ (open me if you've ever had HA about rabies)",
    "selftext": "*WARNING: THIS ENTIRE THING IS AN ADHD SHIT POST. READ AT YOUR OWN RISK & HOPE IT MAKES SENSE*\n\nI went to the 18472828473819385382919475th page of google so YOU didnt have to. \n\nFor starters, I am NOT a doctor or scientist or a smart person by any means I am just a fellow health anxiety sufferer who combats her health anxiety with facts & stats and would like to share her findings with all of you beautiful people. \n\nI will not be linking anything because...Ive opened every link out there okay. Every link. Every pdf. Every news article. Every Wikipedia page. There would be waaaaay too many. \n\nYou CAN look this stuff up yourself and I do encourage it if you are confident you will not trigger yourself and end up in the ER.\n\n✨ SO ✨\n\nWithout further ado, lets get into it.\n\nAnimals that can carry & transmit the rabies virus: \n- Dogs\n- Cats\n- Bats\n- Foxes\n- Skunks\n- Racoons.\n\nI will not be covering foxes, skunks, and raccoons, because I would HOPE you know to go get checked out if one of those motherfuckers rips a hole in your skin & thats that.\n\nHow does one get rabies? \n\nThe answer:\n\nThrough the bite or scratch of an infected animal showing clinical symptoms.\n\n1 very important thing I need you to notice in that sentence. \n\n*it has to be showing clinical symptoms.*\n\nThat means its drooling, foaming at the mouth, it can barely walk, its extremely aggressive for no reason and literally going out of its way to fucking attack you.\n\nYou can watch a video on youtube if you can bear it of a poor kitty infected with it. That will give you an idea of what these animals will look like when showing clinical symptoms.\n\nIt then, when showing clinical symptoms will have to bite or scratch you HARD ENOUGH TO DRAW BLOOD (read that twice. It can literally bite or scratch you with rabies but if it doesnt draw blood youre safe.) or it will need to directly spit or drool into your mucous membranes or an open wound.\n\nFirst biggest stat you need to know - rabies is even more rare to be contracted by scratch or any other way that isnt a bite. In fact its almost unheard of. I read about 2 cases total of someone being scratched and developing rabies. The reason this is - is because the animal would have to lick its claws right before scratching you. Understood?\n\nMOVING ON.\n\nRabies is contracted 99% of the time through dogs or cats.\n\nIm sure that little stat just scared the hell out of you, but dont let it. Heres why. \n\nThe reason that number is so high, is because we come into contact most with dogs & cats. \n\nAlso keep in mind rabies is extremely super duper rare, and that 99% is only the extremely few cases that have happened. So dont hear that percentage and flip because thats a statistic of like what - maybe 20 cases that have happened since the 1950s?\n\nAnd now for the most relieving piece of information about dogs & cats with rabies. \n\nThanks to strict vaccination laws - rabies in our domesticated furry little friends is almost out of the question.\n\nAll cats and dogs must be vaccinated I believe at 3 weeks of age, and then again at 1 year and every 3 years after that.\n\nBUT did you know a scientist recently did a study on how long these vaccinations can truly last in these animals by injecting them with the rabies virus and seen how they held up. Here are his findings:\n(This study was just in dogs but it was said it would work for cats too!)\n\nDogs infected with the rabies virus that were ✨a year late✨ on vaccinations: 100% protected, showed no symptoms whatsoever. \n\nDogs infected with the rabies virus ✨3 years late✨ for vaccinations: 100% were completely protected. No signs of rabies were shown.\n\nDogs infected with the rabies virus ✨5 years late✨ for vaccinations: 100% were completely protected. No signs of rabies were shown.\n\nAnything after 5 years began to drop. First to 90% all the way down to 50%. Vets are even rallying together to change the vaccination updates to every 5 years to save the pet owners some money!!! It lasts these little guys longer than we thought! How awesome!\n\nIm going to move on from dogs and cats now - but first if youre not completely reassured - look up the last dog or cat who had rabies in your state. Read up on if that animal even had contact with a human. In my case, it didnt. And theres been no dog in my state who has tested positive since the 1950s. *SINCE THE 1950s.* Im assuming this holds true for the lot of you as well! \n\nAnyways, lets move onto ✨bats✨\n\nNow.\n\nI know looottts about bats, because they are predominantly the ones I worry about transmitting it to me, even though this fear is completely & totally irrational.\n\nYou'll see why after I present all the facts.\n\nFirst stat you need to know - 1% of all bats have rabies.\n\n*One. Measly. Percent.*\n\nThere was a study done by a man whos been studying bats for 55 years in Texas. \n\nThis man literally walks into caves and into bat infested areas looking to study bats.\n\nBats have flown into his face, chest, neck, bare arms & legs, literally hitting him all over.\n\nAnd in 55 years, he never got bit or scratched.\n\nCare to know why? I bet you do.\n\nBats, are extremely scared of humans. Literally terrified. Why? Because we're the reason theyre dying and going endangered in record numbers. Weve given them something called white nose syndrome from disrupting their caves and roost sites. Multitudes of bats are dying from this little known disease - not rabies. They will literally do anything in their power to get away from us. They are not creatures of violence. A bat will NEVER go out of its way to attack you. *even rapid.*  \n\nIf you want - look up human cases of rabies caused by bats. Youll notice a few things. \n\n1. Over half of them were caused by people picking them up. \n2. The other half happened when the bat was in the persons house while the person slept - AND THE PERSON KNEW THEY WERE BIT AND CHOSE NOT TO SEEK TREATMENT.\n3. 4 of those cases were literally organ transplants of a bat variant of rabies. YALL. 🤦🤦🤦\n\nSo the 2 things I want you to remember - if you didnt pick up a bat, youre chances of rabies decreases to almost 0%. \n\n2, if you wake up to a bat in your room - you still may not have rabies. Observe how the bat is acting. Rapid or no? Then, Inspect yourself for bite marks. Call the hospital & ask for guidance on if you need the antivirus or not. Call local animal control to remove the bat and have it tested for the virus. They will call you with the results.\n\nAnd on the topic of bat bites.\n\nIm sure youve all heard the giant fucking ✨MYTH✨ that you cant feel a bat bite. It has been reported NUMEROUS times to feel like 2 HYPODERMIC FUCKING NEEDLES ENTERING YOUR SKIN. It will also NOTICEABLY draw blood and you CAN notice the scar after it heals. Dont listen to that nonsense about \"you wont even know\" its just fear mongerers trying to get their money off that 10,000 dollar anti virus you got because they preyed on your HA. \n\nLegit even the people bit in their sleep FOUND the bite mark the next morning. You would have to. It HAS TO GET NASTY AND INFECTED PEOPLE. IT CANT JUST DISAPPEAR ITS GONNA GET ALL GROSS AND SLIMY AND WEIRDLY COLORED. Its actually the number one symptom AFTER the inital contact with a rapid animal, and that INCLUDES bats. It will itch, it will hurt, it will show signs of infection.\n\nAnyway.\n\nBACK TO THE TEXAS BAT LAD. )\n\nIn Austin Texas, they released over 1 million bats to actually test & see if it would increase cases of rabies. Texas bat lad was apart of this study.\n\nNot a single case was reported in humans. \nAnd out of a million only a handful A HANDDDFULLLLL of bats tested positive. \nI cant remember the exact numbers, but it was in the low hundreds out of *over a million.*\n\nTexas bat lad who again has 55 years of being around bats under his belt, says there is never any real threat AT ALL unless youre going around picking up bats.\n\nSo what have we learned? DO NOT PICK UP BATS. EVEN THOUGH LESS THAN 1% CARRY THE VIRUS. DONT. FUCKING. DO IT.\n\nHeres some facts about bats with rabies.\n\n1. I said this earlier, but its good to remember. They will never go out of their way to attack you. They are terrified of you. Even rapid, they will be trying to get the fuck away from you. \n\n2. When bats have rabies, they become EXTREMELY lethargic. Theyre so small and its already so much work for the little guys to fly. This disease tires them out completely. You probably wont ever even see one with rabies because they like to go somewhere and hide out until they unfortunately die of it. Poor babies. ❤\n\n3. Even though less than 1% of bats have rabies, and the chances of them EVER transmitting that to you is incredibly low, here are the symptoms presented in bats with rabies: spending lots of time on the ground, out at daytime, will not care if you disturb him, walking around instead of flying, if it is able to fly, it will literally be moreso jumping a little ways into the air and erractily flapping its wings only to fall to the ground, loud hissing and screeching over and over and over and over and over. Like rage screeching okay.\n\nAnd now for the most extensive work I did, hope this comes through for someone. \n\nI literally researched the bats that were most common to transmit rabies.\n\nHere you are.\n\nThe Silver Haired Bat: transmitted it to humans 16 times.\n\nThe Hoary Bat: transmitted it to humans 11 times.\n\nLittle/Big Brown Bat: 2 or 3 times between the two.\n\nTheres more, but it was also 1 or 2 times. The reason I included little & big brown is because they are the most commonly seen bat!!! \n\nWell, Big Brown is the most commonly seen I mean.\n\nChances are you've seen one. Almost all the other bats are extremely endangered by white nose syndrome.\n\nHes the most commonly seen bat EVER and hes only transmitted it 2 or 3 times, possibly 1. We dont know. In fact I tried to find the cases that included big brown, but, it happened so long ago I cant.\n\nSo the bat youve probably spiraled about before? Was him. And he posed no risk at all. \n\nHes also the most frequently tested bat for rabies (because hes so common) and over all the THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS SENT IN, only 3.8% had rabies. Thats 1 in 25, folks. \n\nHes also adorable & furry do look him up. ☺\n\n✨ALRIGHT✨\n\nNow that Ive covered the animals.\n\nLets cover rabies itself. \n\nHere are the facts.\n\n1. Rabies has the same rarity as winning the lottery. Youd win the lottery before you got rabies. \n\n2. Rabies is 100% curable before clinical symptoms show. Clinical symptoms are: dehydration, aversion to water, drooling, paralysis, not eating. CLINICAL SYMPTOMS ARE NOT THESE SYMPTOMS THAT ALSO PRESENT WITH RABIES: fever, sore throat, rash at the bite wound, headache, fatigue, nausea, general discomfort. DO YOU ALL KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS??? If you are worried you are exposed, and show ANY of the last symptoms I mentioned, you are still 100% in the clear & can go promptly be seen. Those signs are not clinical, meaning the virus has not made it to the brain yet.\n\n3. Rabies ✨IS NOT✨ 100% fatal like you were told. 14 people have lived AFTER showing clinical symptoms. Thats still low but you know what else that means? ✨ *YOUR CHANCES OF SURVIVING RABIES ARE HIGHER THAN YOUR CHANCES OF EVER GETTING RABIES*✨ \n\n4. Of the 14 people who survived - half were put into a coma that allowed the body to trick the virus into thinking the host had died. Except one little girl who LITERALLY FUCKING KILLED ✨RABIES✨ with good old hydrogen peroxide. She picked up a bat, it bit her, her mom immediately ✨DOUSED✨ that open wound with peroxide, collected the bat, and sent it in for testing. It tested positive, they quarantined the girl, she never showed one damn symptom. What Im saying is - if you ever get bit, DOUSE THAT BITCH IN PEROXIDE.\n\n5. About 100,000 people get the rabies antivirus shots every year. About 1 or 3 of them really even needed it - because they more than likely werent exposed because its so damn rare.\n\nI think that about covers it!!! \n\nI hope I remembered everything. If anyone leaves a question or something down below Ill probably remember and comment with more facts I forgot to include up here.\n\nI apologize for my scatter brain and truly hope someone was able to gain something from reading this, let me know if it helped any of you, and sorry for the length!!! \n\n✨ THE END ✨",

    "selftext": "Hi! \n\nI had an eye twitch for 2 1/2 months that wouldn't go away and that was actually getting worst week after week. The twitch had also started spreading to other places on my face, but in less intensity, like on my other eye and my lips.\n\nWhile I had the twitches, I've googled a lot and became anxious of rare diseases like BEB (benign essential blepharospasms), multiple sclerosis or als.\n\nThere wasn't lot of infos on reddit about eye twitching lasting more than a month, so that's why I wanna make this post. \n\nMost of the posts I've read on reddit and most of the infos on google recommended to sleep more, reduce eye strain, drink less caffeine, take potassium, take magnesium, drink less alcohol, smoke less, use hydrating eye's drops and reduce stress.\n\nI tried most of those things after the first 3 days of my eye twitching: I started eating bananas and taking potassium and magnesium pills daily, use eye drops twice daily, stop drinking coffee and avoid being on the computer or on my phone. \n\nI've give up on those things after around a week, because it wasn't helping and my twitches was getting worst, so I stop the pills-bananas-eyedrops and re-started drinking coffee and using my computer and phone normally again. I don't usually smoke nor drink alcohol except on very, very rare occasions (like, 3-4x/year), and I was already sleeping 7-8hrs/night, so those recommandations didn't apply to me. \n\nSo long story short, I've been on vacations from work for the last 1 1/2 week, and my twitches went away after the first 2-3 days off work. So even though I wasn't feeling tired nor stressed, I guess I was, and the twitches was probably just my body trying to tell me I was more stressed than I thought. I'm just hoping now the twitches won't come back when I go back to work next week!\n\nSo that's it, I just wanna described my experience if someone else is going through something similar. If you have eye twitches for months and potassium/eyedrops/magnesium/stop-drinking-coffee isn't working, it doesn't mean you have MS or BEB or something's else. It may just go away on it owns after some time. \n\nI hope it helps! :)",

Either way any new bumps/lumps should be checked but they will most likely be harmless! \n\nI myself found 3 lumps around my ribcage and that’s what made my HA very very bad to the point I couldn’t sleep or eat.

The 1 & 2 year old ate a bucket of sand. A whole fucking bucket. My sister in laws husband got in a motorcycle reck and flew off his bike under another car. He was unconscious when they got to him. He had to have surgery and was released within a few days. \n\nMy fiance swam in the high tide area WAY past the safe limit. He had fish jumping over his head at one point.\n\nWhere can I get this energy??? WHY AM I AFRAID ALL THE TIME???? WHY CANT I LIVE WITH NO REGARD FOR MY SAFETY LIKE THIS???? *FUCK* and I mean this from the bottom of my heart, *FUCK HEALTH ANXIETY.*",

    "title": "Good reminders for the week",
    "selftext": "Hey there, just wanted to pass by and remind you guys of a few things:\n\n* **Exercising** will make your heart rate go up, it's normal. Climbing stairs, having sex, walking, even standing up in a bus can make you feel tired and give you muscle pain (if you aren't used to exercise). Don't stop exercising because of those symptoms, you're supposed to feel them at first and it's more natural to the body if you exercise than if you don't (unless you have a debilitating disease which is rare and still can exercise with medical monitoring).\n* **Headaches** can be caused by lack of sleep, too much sleep, not drinking enough water, clenching your teeth, alcohol, too much noise or bright lights and anxiety.\n* Speaking of **anxiety**, it can give you so many symptoms there are lists on the internet to check them. But since googling is not very nice for people here, I'll give you some: rapid heartbeats, cold on body extremities, palpitation, trembling hands, dizziness, sensation of tingling or numbness, wish to cry or run away, twitching, stomach pains, diarrhea or constipation, bloating, restless legs... The list goes on.\n* If you took a **vaccine** and your arm feels warm and kind of swollen, that's a normal reaction. Feeling some cold symptoms too. Also some vaccines last for 10 years, so if you've taken the tetanus one (for example) five years ago, don't worry about tetanus.\n* It's not that easy to catch **HIV**. You don't catch it by oral sex. You don't catch it by wearing condoms. If you take a lot of tests afterwards on the right time and they come all negative, you don't have it. Those kind of tests are more reliable than symptoms.\n* Tetanus doesn't just come from rusty things, you'd have to get a really deep cut to get it. Brain eating bacteria is extremely rare and won't be on your tap water. Throwing up is a natural response and means your body is fighting something bad, don't force yourself to stop it. You need to be penetrated without a protection to get pregnant, periods can be irregular. Some paint or fume won't give you problems or kill you. \n* **Cats and dogs** who have their vaccines and anti fungicide and live inside houses won't give you anything. Scratches hurt and they're supposed to get a bit swollen afterwards. \n* **After getting a cold or the flu, you will feel tired**. Your body was combating something, you are supposed to feel a bit tired afterwards. Just remember to keep yourself hydrated, to rest and eat something simple!\n* Your body isn't perfect, and our diets aren't either. **Sometimes your poop will be different**. Medicine, recovering from an infection, different foods, stress and lack of water can change the shape and color of it. Just remember to eat as well as possible, because your intestine is your \"second brain\", as in it will help you combat against anxiety or depression.\n* **You can't control someone else's life.** I'm sorry, but as much as you worry about them, you can't watch them every minute of their day. It won't stop them from getting hurt or sick. The best way to deal with anxiety for others is simply helping them emotionally as much as they need and go to therapy yourself.\n* **Google** will give you terrible diseases for your symptoms because it has to and it wants you to keep searching for things. Trust doctors. Trust the data, some diseases (mainly neurological) are extremely rare and googling it won't solve anything. Everytime you feel the need to be reassured, try instead helping someone here by replying to some posts, going for a walk, focusing on things you see around you or talk to someone anything other than health issues.\n* Also try avoiding sugary drinks, and if your birth control pills aren't working/giving you bad symptoms for a while, go to a gynecologist to change them.\n* By washing your hands, cleaning your vegetables, eating well, having good hygiene, exercising, going to the ophthalmologist once a year (or once every two years), having protected sex and sleeping well, you will be avoiding most sickness you can. Seriously, you're doing way more than most people in the world. And even without those people live a lot. **So will you.**\n\nSo remember: you can be afraid of getting hit by a car and look at both sides to cross the street to avoid it. But don't be so afraid that it stops you from crossing it at all. Connect with your family, talk to your friends, try to look out for therapy, party, study, but please, don't let HA eat you alive. Don't stop doing things because you're afraid of getting sick. Do whatever you can to escape it, as hard as it is.\n\nAnd remember, progress isn't linear, and that's okay. \n\nYou'll all be fine! (And sorry for any mistakes, english is not my first language)",

    "title": "Think Before You Post: why reassurance seeking might be feeding your health anxiety.",
    "selftext": "Hey /r/healthanxiety, \n\nJust thought I'd make a post detailing my personal experience and knowledge about reassurance seeking and why it is self destructive. \n\nSo, you're experiencing your symptom that you're increasingly more worried about. Whether that be chest pains, heart palpitations, stomach problems, poop problems, any of the hundreds of symptoms any of us could possibly be worried about. \n\nYou're worried about if this is the time where your worrying is justified, or if it is actually a sign of the illness you're fearing.\n\nMaybe you've already been to the doctor to get checked out, but doubt their opinion.\n\nAll of these have happened to me, and happen to many many other HA sufferers, which is completely okay. \n\n**However**, the way you deal with it is paramount to your recovery.\n\nUsually, what I would do, is post here, explaining my symptoms and what I was worried it was. Then I'd get some replies reassuring me and maybe feel better for a bit. Or I'd ask a close friend or family member and get the same results.\n\nAll of this felt like what I had to do, a huge compulsion to do this just to know that I was fine. \n\nIn the short term, yes, it made me feel better but this was only short lived.\n\nThis might also account for medical tests, I've spoken to many people who have previously thought that getting that MRI or CT, colonoscopy or endoscopy, or whatever it might be, would make all their worries go away. Which, after the short term relief, the anxiety came back. This is so important to understand and grasp to begin recovering from health anxiety; I speak from experience.\n\nOne of the biggest things in recovery is how you deal with these thoughts and need for reassurance. Possibly even the key to fixing your health anxiety.\n\nSo, if you don't seek that reassurance, what's going to happen? For me, at first, it was unbareable anxiety, and just an extreme desire to check I was okay, whether that was through posting to the subreddit, the discord, asking family, checking my body for lumps, checking my lymph nodes etc. \n\nYou'll most likely experience increased anxiety whilst not seeking the reassurance you want, which is completely okay. Rather than seeking reassurance, do something mindful, something genuinely healthy for the mind. As, when in a very high anxiety situation, sometimes it's the things that you do during that time that really define how your mental wellbeing will go in the future. \n\nYou can do many things, for me, it was taking myself away from what I was doing and spending 10 minutes trying to immerse or distract myself within something else, not an easy task by any means, but something to try. After the 10 minutes was up I would come back to what I was doing and try to revert my thoughts away from my worry, which most times the anxiety had passed and I didn't need to seek further reassurance. \n\nYou could possibly try meditation, though, if you don't regularly practice it, it'll be very difficult to do under high anxiety levels. \n\nYou could try relaxing music, your favourite food, anything else that enhances your mood, whatever works for you. \n\nDuring this time, you will experience anxiety, potentially more during that time of not seeking the reassurance, but I promise you, in the long run it is going to do wonderful things compared to getting the reassurance and feeding the problem.\n\nWhen you seek reassurance, you're reinforcing the behaviours which keep your health anxiety alive unfortunately, because usually it feels like the right thing, and the only thing to do in that situation. But trust me, try not seeking it.\n\nIt'll be very similar to [this graph](https://thegirlwiththecurlyhair.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/anxiety-repeated-exposure-graph.png), the more you do it the easier it'll be. And it might get to the point where the anxiety almost completely goes after a while of practicing this. \n\nSeriously, it is worth definitely giving a go and thinking about this if you're currently having a lot of anxiety, I've been there hundreds of times, and applying this mentality was one of the key turning points into recovering from health anxiety. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The one who isn’t living their life because they are so sure they are going to drop dead at any moment. \n\nI’m saying all of this because I was that person, and sometimes, still am that person. I’ve been dealing with anxiety, and more specifically health anxiety for the better of 2-3 years now on and off. For the longest time I was convinced I had everything from all the illnesses I listed above and then some. Fast heart rate? Heart disease/heart attack. Air hunger? Pulmonary embolism or lung cancer. Tingling feelings? MS. Migraines/sinus headaches? Brain cancer. I’ve been through it all. I know what it’s like to sit there with the feeling of doom and having my brain cycle over and over again with everything I could possibly have.\n\nIf it’s one thing I’ve learned after my last ER visits is the power of the mind. For months I was dealing with air hunger, not getting a satisfied breath when inhaling so I would constantly take deep breaths trying to get that satisfied feeling. The more I did that the worse it got. I ended up going to the ER, AGAIN, for the 10th time in the last few years only to get normal results AGAIN. From that day I told myself that I will no longer be a victim to my intrusive thoughts and trust the results. And I’m not going to sit here and say I’ve cured myself, not by a long-shot, but with practice and STAYING OFF THE INTERNET I’ve noticed 80% of all my health worries have disappeared. \n\nIf you’ve been checked by a doctor/specialist, believe your results, if you have doubt get a second opinion. But once you do, SNAP OUT OF IT. I am NOT a doctor, but after being checked from head to toe more times over the last few years than most people do in their whole life I said enough is enough. What’s the point of letting life pass by just anticipating an illness? None.\n\nSNAP OUT OF IT AND START LIVING AGAIN!",

This is perhaps the longest day of my life. Every hour since starting the prep felt like ages. I spent the entire night before researching my symptoms, reading stories online, and overthinking like I always do. \n\nI knew it wouldn't change anything, but maybe I was looking for some sort of assurance.\n\nFor the past year I've been having:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* streaks of blood in stool\n* lots of mucus in stool\n* gradual thinning of stools\n* alternating diarrhea and constipation\n* rectal pressure (feels like I'm sitting on a marble)\n* incomplete bowel movement\n* occasional abdominal cramping\n* fatigue (I used to easily run 5 miles without stopping but now at 2 miles I'm short of breath)\n* weight loss (15 pounds in around five months)\n* bloodwork showed slightly low iron (normal hemoglobin) & slightly elevated liver enzymes (thought it spread)\n* CT scan showed fatty liver (but I was worried it was a misdiagnosed liver metastases)\n\nAll these symptoms gradually got worse in the course of a year that I eventually pushed for a colonoscopy. As someone with health anxiety, the only thing that assured me was that I was young (23). \n\nBut after reading so many horror stories of young people like me getting cancer at later stages because they were dismissed, I didn't take any second chances.\n\nAnyway, colonoscopy was a breeze. Doc didn't find any polyp, but there was mild inflammation in my rectum and sigmoid colon, causing my GI symptoms. The others were attributed to stress and anxiety, especially the weight loss. The diagnosis was called **proctosigmoiditis.** I was prescribed some antibiotics. She did say it kind of increases my risks of developing CRC, so I will have to get a colonoscopy every 3-5 years for prevention.\n\n**I was really convinced that I had cancer.** There was no way stress would be producing blood in my stool or skewing my bloodwork.\n\nBut then again, I'm thankful it's not. I haven't been eating healthy ever since so I guess this is a wake up call for me to change my lifestyle. I take this as a second chance.\n\nAnd to fellow young people like me worrying about their symptoms, I highly suggest pushing for a colonoscopy. Stop googling. Stop convincing yourself without a proper diagnosis and procedures to investigate your case. I spent a year getting anxious and convincing myself I was late-stage over my symptoms. I became unproductive and even hurt my work and the people around me. Today, I felt a huge burden had been lifted off my chest.\n\nAnd to those who actually are fighting this horrible illness, I truly admire your spirit. I hope everything goes well for all of you.",

Give whatever symptom you’re having 5 entire days before you start rushing to Google. Your body does weird things. So does mine. So does everyone else’s. My left hand literally went numb while typing this, I laughed and ignored it... now it’s fine. I forgot I was gripping my steering wheel and singing in the car. Oh, and I’m drinking coffee. Damnit. See #3. (Obviously don’t wait 5 days on a broken arm. IANAD and none of this is medical advice.)\n\n5. When you start to panic, go for a walk or light jog. Don’t paralyze your being into your phone. Whatever you’re *used to doing*, surprise your body by doing something else. Don’t go in the bathroom, sit on the toilet, Google your symptoms, and leave feeling weak-minded. (Anyone relate?) Do something different. \n\nSincerely, 30/m panicker who has fought over 1,000 panic attacks since the age of 14 and has slowly been winning more than he’s losing.",

You have reps and sets to become stronger, right? Same thing for anxiety. The weight will feel heavy and you’ll tremble. Hell, you may even drop the weight. But the more you lift it, the stronger you get and the lighter it feels. \n\nRemind yourself that you’ve gotten through x,y,z before. Remind yourself that panic attacks don’t last. Remind yourself of anything a doctor or someone close ever said that has brought you relief. \n\nOur brain became trained to be on high alert. It can be trained to monitor without fear.

The odds of the smallest twinge in your chest being a heart attack are nearly nonexistent. The odds of your floaters being a brain tumor are minuscule.

You only hear about the absolute worst case scenarios online, but those are the outliers that are only used as scare tactics for online traffic. \n\nThis post is a reminder to myself as well as anyone else lurking, searching for that one post to put your mind at ease. \n\nStop worrying.

    "selftext": "The title... as simple and straight to the point as I can get.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've had this condition since I was around 18. A random pain in my head waiting for a bus with my girlfriend instantly triggered what we know as HA. I then found a lump on my testicle New Years Day 2012 and wow did that really mess me up. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also experience weed induced panic attacks which then boil over into HA and I would never wish that psychological torture on my worst enemy, EVER! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, I have found things after being ignorant of them which can really inflate the chances of anxiety attacks. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1.) Caffeine. Stay AWAY from Caffeine if you are prone to daily HA attacks. (Personally talking, having one cup of tea in the morning I find is okay, FOR ME!) \n\n2.) Don't shy away from talking about it with friends. Talking about it, I've found, is like drawing your sword to the enemy and pushing it further away each time we talk about. Listening to peoples rational responses should help cement your own rational thoughts.\n\n3.) HA has been documented to cause all sorts of psycho-somatic symptoms, to save you the hassle of Googling, it's a psychological condition/response or even disturbance where the mind creates physical pain due to thinking there has been pain there for a considerate amount of time, as such, we have a little cramp in our belly, leg, head, behind the eyes, etc, we will start concentrating on that area more and more, causing a bias confirmation that there is something wrong (I think you MAY have to Google psychosomatica as it is very interesting) \n\n4.) The mind wanders when it has nothing to do, every time you're aware you're having irrational thoughts, re-direct those thoughts/energy into doing something physical, like reading, walking, meditation and yoga are all extremely forgotten medicines that have been proven to heal the soul and calm the mind. \n\n5.) Do not waste your time worrying about what may or may not take you from this earth, with the time we have here. Use the anxiety as a trigger to remind yourself it is taking your literal life away, and the last thing we want to do is being alive and not actually living. \n\n6.) Take up mind stimulating games, such as chess, sudoku, learn an instrument - I've found that indulging in learning a second language, my mind has no time to remind me of the HA I have, a very helpful tool in forgetting there is ever a problem. \n\n7.) Realize that happiness is free, and it's the only thing we take for granted. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope this very non-orthodox way of looking and explaining my experience can help others who think they are the only unique ones who feel the way they do, we all feel the same way about the fear, where that fear stems from could be different areas, but looking at that fear head on can also be the strongest tool we utilize. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope everyone is feeling okay while reading this and understand YOU ARE NOT ALONE! This is becoming more and more of a global pandemic than the current pandemic, and is frustratingly never ever shown in MSM or practices in general.",

It took some serious balls of steel for me, and I almost canceled my appointments several times, but I kept it together and got a blood test and physical. When my doctor measured my pulse, she almost couldn't believe how high it was (\\~150 bpm), and I had to explain how scared I was. But, at the end, she told me I had a clean bill of health, and suddenly SO much anxiety that had weighed on me for so, so long, was just gone in an instant.\n\nI just wanted to share this, because most people I talk to about it consider doctors appointments so routine that they don't understand how big of a deal it is for me.

    "selftext": "It all started with the headaches. I was getting them all day for a few weeks when I decided to go to my GP  for a check up. She did a neurological exam (everything was clear) but said just to be sure let’s do a CT scan. I got the CT which was clear of anything which was great. Next was my arm jerks that felt like an electric shock. My anxiety went into overdrive and I demanded an appointment with a neurologist. \n\nI got referred to one of the greatest neurologists in Sydney- Dr Spira of Spira Neurology who did a complete neurological work up in her office (again, everything was clean). She said just to be sure let’s do an MRI scan. I followed orders and scheduled in for an MRI scan. I was terribly anxious and have never been more scared in my life. My next appointment with my neuro was a few days after my scan. I was thinking positively and thought this is just my health anxiety flaring up.\n\nI got to the appointment and my Dr told me that there was an abnormality in my scan. My heart sank and I immediately started sweating. She told me that there was some kind of damage to my cerebellum and one of the sulcal spaces was enlarged. She told me she thought it was an incidental finding but said we would have to do another scan in three months.\n\nI was mortified. I kept rereading the report over and over again. I researched every word and medical phrase. Of course I found out in my dr google adventures that an enlarged Sulcal space of the cerebellum could be indicitive of a deadly disease called Multiple System Atrophy. This disease has a 100% death rate of those affected. It is similar to Parkinson’s or ALS. Another symptom\nOf this disease was electric shocks in your arms and legs that made the affected limb jolt. My\nMind went into overdrive. \n\nI had also been suffering from urinary problems due to a benign disease called Non bacterial prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome which makes you have abnormal urinating habits. This was also a sign of MSA. I’ve got it. I have definitely got it. I started to get extremely depressed and all I could think about was dying.\n\nI self medicated with alcohol and drugs for three months just to get through each day. The next MRI comes around ever so slowly. I have to take several Valium’s to knock myself out for the scan.\n\nMy next appointment with my neuro is in a couple of weeks. My partner and I decide to take a holiday to take my mind of it.\n\nThe big day comes. My neurologist tells me the scan hasn’t changed which is tremendous news. She said the best neuroradiologist reviewed my file and said it looks congenital (from birth) and there’s been no change. When I tell my neuro of my fears about MSA she laughs and says no way. I tell her I have all the symptoms. She laughs again and points out all the reasons why I don’t have this disease. She said she would put her title of doctor on the line to say I do not have this disease.\n\nThe symptoms have disappeared since. I sometimes still struggle and revert to thinking I am dying but I know I’m not. The point of the story is that you can have all the symptoms of a certain disease (even imaging) and still won’t have it. I really\nEmpathise with everyone battling this horrid anxiety. If you don’t have it you won’t understand.\n\nI am with you all. I have been through our worst nightmare and I came out the other side. Remember this story when battling your own demons. Good luck in future imagined diseases.",

    "title": "After nearly one year of MS symptoms, I did a brain MRI and...",
    "selftext": "Here's my story. I'm a 23 yo Hispanic male, and starting from June 2021, I started having:\n\nHeadaches and I've never had them before in my life. They're one-sided, mostly dull and constant, rarely lancinating, but didn't throb.\n\nA dramatic increase in eye floaters, though I remember seeing some of them when I was a kid. Not sure if they were always there and I began noticing them more, or indeed more appeared.\n\nFatigue. Most days I could barely work. \n\nBlue entoptic phenomena, and a random black dot appearing around the center of vision once every few days.\n\nThrobbing eye pain, pain when moving my eyes (akin to Optic Neuritis), red sore eyes, dry eyes, blurring and worsening vision on my right eye (astigmatism)\n\nDouble vision, WHOEVER, it was **monocular diplopia** (double vision in one eye, due to my newly found astigmatism or dry eyes I guess), which at the time eased my anxiety a bit since MS double vision is mostly binocular.\n\nWeird numbness/tingling feelings going down my legs and arms on **one side of the body** (left). Random patches would get numb, or the whole limb would go \"numbish\".\n\nRandom calf pains and twitches all over the body. Walking felt weird.\n\nAll the above symptoms came and went. At times they were super noticeable, other, barely or not noticeable.  \n\n\nWent to 2 different eye doctors, both said my retina was 100% healthy. No inflammation, bleeding or anything going on inside my eye or optic nerve.\n\nSo, I appointed an MRI last week. I was afraid of it either being MS, a tumor, or some huge unruptured aneurysm that would change my life. Got my results today and went to the neuro (super cool and chill guy btw) the same day, shitting my pants, taking a Xanax beforehand to prepare me for my impending \"doom\", and he said:\n\n\"Looks like a perfectly healthy brain to me. No signs of abnormalities, aneurysms, or lesions. One of the healthiest I've seen actually!\"\n\nI felt like a huge weight dropped from my back, which I'd been carrying for a year! I'm finally free of those absurd thoughts and now I can live normally without getting paranoid.\n\nFor the person reading: If you're afraid of your symptoms and you think it's MS: Stay calm. Most likely it's not. AND even if it indeed is, MS is super treatable today. Many people live totally normal lives, as long as you catch it as soon as possible.\n\nAlso, I work from home (and play from my PC), so I spend 16+ hours sitting down every single day for 3+ years, and I know I used to have SHIT posture. So, the culprit might be something related to my spine, which I will further investigate.\n\nUPDATE: 07/02/2023 (February 7th, 2023)\n\nI just got a lumbar MRI and it looks like it was all caused by a disc protrusion in L4/L5 and L5/S1. No lesions BTW.\n\nI'm afraid I may also have some bulging disc in my neck (which might explain the arm tingling).\n\nSo yeah, while not necessarily good news, it's preferable to having MS, and much easier to deal with too.",

    "selftext": "I just wanted to share this personal success story in hopes that it will make someone else less anxious about medical procedures.\n\nI have had anxiety since as long as I can remember. I remember being like 5 years old and staying awake all night due to insomnia and worry. My biggest anxiety related fear is health anxiety. I’ve spent hours googling minor symptoms, have gone to urgent care when literally nothing was wrong with me multiple times, and felt crazy pretty much all the time. I tend to ignore medical issues out of fear that they’re the worst possible scenario. I wasn’t given that option yesterday as scared as I was I am feeling so much better about my health anxiety today. \n\nLong story short (ish), I had a dull pain in my lower right side starting on Wednesday morning. It kind of hurt when I walked or moved a certain way, but it wasn’t excruciating. When I woke up yesterday, it was tender to the touch and I knew that probably meant something serious was wrong. I took myself to urgent care and they said to go to the ER immediately. I have no family in this part of the state and my boyfriend was working, so I had to get admitted by myself. Due to the virus, I learned upon being admitted that I could not have any visitors at all. This is when I started to freak out because being not only terrified and not knowing what was wrong with me, now I had to be ALONE through all of it. \n\nThey performed a CT scan and determined that I did indeed have appendicitis and it needed to be removed immediately, like that day in a few hours. All I could do was frantically text/call my family and my boyfriend. I was so terrified and I let the nurses know about my anxiety/depression diagnosis. They were all super understanding and nice. \n\nAbout an hour goes by and someone comes into my room and announces that I’m going to pre-op right now. I had minimal time to text anyone and was wheeled away to the OR. For some reason, although I was scared shitless I knew that there was nothing I could do and I just had to let it happen. I’m home today in less than 24 hours recovering well. And I even drove myself home. I did all of this completely alone in my worst nightmare anxiety scenario. \n\nAfter refusing SSRI’s for the better part of a decade, I began taking lexapro about 6 months ago. It has helped me tremendously and I think that has a lot to do with why I was able to stay so calm (at least outwardly). Also, letting every nurse/doctor that I came into contact with that i was incredibly anxious and fearful seemed to help so much. They were great and made a horrible experience at least bearable. \n\nI know medication isn’t right for everyone and I’m just saying that I personally have noticed a huge improvement with my anxiety symptoms since I began taking lexapro. I’m just so proud of myself for not panicking and just getting through it. I actually feel more confident now about my ability to handle stress and ask for help when I need it. \n\nI hate that we all experience this shitty feeling all the time but you are not alone. And I think it can get better over time.",

It's an incredibly effective (and simple) method to rewire your nerves and get out of your anxious patterns. I recently had a setback with both health anxiety and DPDR (old habits die hard) and after also reading the book started consistently applying the method again. No kidding, after two days the worst of it was over. I still feel like my nerves are on edge occasionally, but they're finally desensitizing/healing and it's nothing compared to the nightmarish feeling I had even just a week ago. Here's a [summary](https://www.idealist.org/en/careers/4-step-method-managing-anxiety-at-work) of the method.\n\nHope it helps you too.

I would love to see this sub dedicated more towards RECOVERING from HA and supporting real progress rather than just applying band-aids. After all, seeking and receiving reassurance is actually harmful and makes HA worse in the long run. \n\nWe need more: \n\n* Success stories, no matter how small\n* Methods for distracting from HA (temporary solutions)\n* Methods for confronting HA (long-term solutions)\n* Sharing advice from therapists\n* Personal reviews of anti-anxiety medications \n* Posts updated with outcomes\n* Posts about developing and maintaining good physical health \n* Community challenges\n* Weekly success threads\n\nSo many of us engage in unhealthy behaviors that will inevitably lead to the disease we so dread. So many of us worry about non-preventable disease that we forget to do what we can to prevent preventable disease. So many of us have a self-defeating mentality that we will always struggle with HA and that there's nothing to be done about it but suffer through it. But there ARE steps to take, healthy habits to practice, and real solutions to address the root of our anxiety. And this subreddit should be a hub for that kind of supportive information, a beacon of hope for people who can't stop worrying about their health and need practical, tangible help. Let's not wallow, let's do the work, together. Can we hold each other accountable for unsafe/unhealthy behaviors, check up on each other, be more intentional with our posts? Can we cultivate a culture of real healing rather than just putting out endless fires?\n\n[Edited to add more bullet points]",

    "title": "The science behind our health anxiety (OCD) in laymans terms - and how to break the cycle",
    "selftext": "Hey guys,\n\nI spent the weekend researching this monster of an illness, and I want to share some thoughts as to why this thing is happening to all of us. \n\nSo for the vast majority of us, this is a combination of OCD + anxiety. It is not simply anxiety, because we spend days and weeks on fixating symptoms, which becomes and obsession, and then we want to eliminate that symptom at all costs (going to the doctor, checking for those bumps and changes, asking this place, friend for reassurance, etc.) As for anxiety, we notice a sensation (we are hypersensitized at this point) and we perceive that as a threat, our body enter the good old fight or flight mode. This is the \"trigger\" for the OCD, aka the obsession. At this point we start Googling or asking for reassurance (compulsion) to mitigate the symptoms. Then when it goes away, it gives a temporary relief, until the next sensation comes along. Anxiety also causes us to jump the worst of the conclusions. You are probably like this (and like me) in other facets of life too, as in \"if i fail this exam, I will never finish uni, never have a job, I will end up homeless\".\n\nGoogling is the worst offender, because you look up your symptoms (which are psychosomatic, btw. - as in they exist, but don't have a medical explanation as to why they exist) - you find a horde of new symptoms of the condition you are obsessed about - and soon enough you will start developing those symptoms too. It's pointless to google, because we don't have a medical condition, and that's where we make our mistakes. Our bodies create symptoms because of the things we read about - why do our bodies do this to ourselves? Because the body perceives the things you read about as a threat - makes up symptoms for you to go to the doctor - so you can be safe. \n\nSo how to break the chain? You need to treat both OCD AND anxiety.\n\n* \"Cold water\" method for OCD: It's when you first go to work, you feel anxious to live up to everyone's expectation. You are extremely out of your comfort zone, but then as each day passes, you sensitize yourself to your job, and it won't cause anxiety anymore. Same with OCD: you need to jump in the cold water, you need to stop doing the obsessive behavior that generates the OCD loop. This is a long ass time, so don't expect results immidiately.\n* As for anxiety: You need to be outside the comfort zone, each minute of the day. Going back to video games won't cure you, it will just mask the problem. Look up Wim Hof method, or David Goggins for starters.\n* As for the most difficult thing: how do I know if I'm actually in need of medical examination? Just take a damn risk. It's better than living this way. If the problem gets worse, doesn't go away after 2 weeks, you notice additional symptoms (actual symptoms like fever, bloody stool, etc.) then yeah, go ahead and get it checked.\n\nWhat won't work:\n\n* Meditation - it can give you a peace of mind, but it won't cure OCD and anxiety.\n* Clean eating\n* Deep breathing\n* And all those extra recommendations those health sites gives you. Feel free to do them anyway because of amazing benefits, but these alone won't cure OCD.\n\nWhy they won't work? Because they don't treat the underlying problem, aka. the OCD loop. Break the loop!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f60l9jwgghh71.png?width=1336&format=png&auto=webp&s=c88405d7afbb0ac1deafe47ef0b2159d694ea30f",

I no longer cry myself to sleep because of a headache I had or a pain on my side. I used to use this sub to confirm or compare symptoms but now, I just have stopped looking at the posts.

I’ve loved finding this group, partially for seeing how common the things I worry about/physically experience are, but also to give advice from my perspective of being (mostly) (kinda?) on the other side of HA and actually help.\n\nYou will one day realise you haven’t thought you were dying in a minute. You’ll have a physical sensation and think, after your initial worst case scenario jump, oh fuck it’s been ages since I had this feeling and then thought - wow. It doesn’t mean you won’t ever think it again. My recovery looks like not reacting to the panic thought, but recognising the context. The thought is still there but it’s more toothless. If I’m away from home, if I’m in a stressful situation, if I’m nervous: hey presto, either my chest hurts, I feel dizzy, my stomach hurts, my arms tingle, i can’t breathe properly, I have short stabbing headaches, my muscles feel atrophied, my heart beats weird or hard - it’s always something (or a number of somethings). But I knew it would in that context. \n\nFor me it was a combination of CBT and the DARE app. It’s subscription but in my financial position, honestly compared to the amount of solace I found in their guided panic attack and health anxiety modules, it was more than worth it. \n\nYour physical sensations are your brain thinking it’s taking care of you. The last 15 panic attacks/headaches/chest pain/etc didn’t kill you. This one won’t either.\n\nJust sending love and support to you all, my inbox is open (I’m not online all the time but I will respond when I can). You will get through this. You are more than your physical sensations. See a GP or specialist if something persists but then - crucially - you have to accept it if they do tests and tell you your body is fine. This was one of the hardest things for me. ECG, MRI, blood tests, cervical screenings (repeated ones) all ok...and then a week later I’m thinking “what if that was too early and they missed it?” \n\nThey didn’t. I know it seems fucking impossible, but I promise you with everything I have - you’ll get through your health anxiety and you’ll sleep, you won’t be scared to exercise, you’ll spend DAYS, weeks, months maybe not worrying about your demise. \n\nI believe in you! (And apologies if this is annoying to you cuz you’re in the thick of it - I get that it’s sometimes frustrating to hear. But you don’t have to believe it right now, but I do, for you.)\n\nETA: I quit caffeine at the height of it and I was shocked at the results (sounds like clickbait 😂)\n\nI had thought for like 15 years I had insomnia. I quit caffeine and started sleeping 7-8 hours a night. That was a MASSIVE part of me feeling better.",

I see posts here often that say: \"I have *convinced* myself that I have \\[disease\\].\" \"I have *diagnosed* myself with \\[disease\\].\" \"I am *100% certain* that I have \\[disease\\].\"\n\nAnd to that I say, *you are not at all qualified to make that determination.* Honestly, imagine setting an appointment with a doctor, going to your appointment, and meeting the person who is supposed to diagnose and treat you. Imagine that person had never gone to medical school. Imagine that their only source of information was WebMD.

Here are the statistics:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the United States, the general public has a 5% chance of developing an aneurysm in their lifetime.\n\nThis affects women more than men at a ratio of 3:2.\n\nOf these, 85-90% never show symptoms.\n\nOf these, only around 1% occur in children under 18. Presumably, the number is not greatly higher in young adults (20's), though I was not able to find direct statistics on that.\n\nOf all aneurysms, only around 1% of aneurysms will ever rupture. Around 99% of people with unruptured brain aneurysms never have to worry about it and die from something else.\n\nOf these, many cases correlate to other risk factors (Genetics, lifestyle habits)\n\nOf this, survival rate is as high as 60%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBased off this, it's reasonable to conclude that the odds for an otherwise healthy person in their 20's with no risk factors to have an aneurysm are very, very unlikely, rarer than being struck by lightning. Literally. Furthermore, while it may seem scary that they cause no symptoms, it also may help a hypochondriac to realize that their symptoms are psychosomatic (imagined, caused by anxiety), though of course, if symptoms do arise and persist, it's important to discuss them with a doctor. Also keep in mind that the symptoms of a ruptured aneurysm are unmistakable. Some of these statistics may seem obvious, but it has helped me to lay them out, and I hope it also helps you.",

    "selftext": "The following have really helped me. \n\n1) I have felt this before, and every time I have gone through this, I have been okay. All I’m feeling is my brain misfiring. My brain just needs to calm down and relax. My brain needs calm support. I will provide myself support by listening to beautiful music, by watching videos that make me laugh and think about interesting things.\n\n2) I am okay, if anything serious were wrong with me, I would KNOW it. I would not be able to calm down after an hour or two, maybe more. (panic feelings can last anywhere from 1 hour to more than 3-5 days. This is NORMAL.)\n\n3) if I can go throughout the day laughing and talking with friends and family, and I feel fine whenever I am DISTRACTED, that means I AM OKAY, it is just anxiety. I only feel anxiety when I am not busy enough. \n\n4) Even if I am not distracted, I AM SAFE. When I am relaxed and it is night time, I AM SAFE.\n\n4) being relaxed will not harm me. Just because I am relaxed, it doesn’t mean something bad will happen. I deserve to feel calm. I am safe, my body knows how to heal itself.\n\n5) Anxiety is scientifically proven to cause sensations that aren’t real. The more I think about it, the more I will feel. \n\n6) deep breath in, count to 5. Breathe from diaphragm. Listen to soothing atmospheric/ambient music while doing so. Focus on the music and my slow breathing... see? I am okay. My brain misfired for a few, but now I am in control. I am okay. This will always pass, I have nothing to worry about. \n\n7) It is safe to observe every feeling in my body. Do not react to these feelings, only observe and treat them like floating clouds passing by. I entertain positive thoughts only. \n\n8) Being sensitized to anxiety has no place now. \n\n9) Healing is natural now for me, starting today. From this point forward, I will overcome and control my reactions to misfirings in my brain. My brain is just wired differently, and that is NOT dangerous. \n\n10) Drink peppermint or chamomile tea, Bite into a lemon, or take a slow, long sniff of an essential oil, such as peppermint, lavender, or eucalyptus. Taste and smell will overcome your anxiety and focus. So that way, you will be distracted from the anxiousness you are feeling. \n\n11) My anxiety is worse at night because I am not distracted and I am afraid help will not reach me in time. Those thoughts are false, I know I will be okay, because I’m the morning, I am completely normal and distracted by the duties of the new day. I will treat my mind and body to the relaxation and sleep it deserves. I will be safe. \n\n12) I have been to the doctor many times, and each time, they confirm I am okay. They are professionals, they KNOW I am okay. Anxiety is powerful, it has the ability to delude me, to cause me to feel miserable. But I will NOT let that happen from this point forward. It is time for me to take control and realize that I need to live life in the moment. I cannot let this cycle continue.",

Put hearts above the i’s, put clouds around every word, colour in all the holes of the letters. Just make it look as silly as you possibly can. When the sentence looks silly you start to distance yourself from that thought. \n\nIt doesn’t have to be this either. You can imagine yourself walking through a shopping centre and every person is wearing a t-shirt with your unhelpful thought on it. Or imagine it on a billboard. Just make it look silly. Don’t let those 7 or so words ruin your day.

    "selftext": "I’ve made my fair share of posts on here about a headache I’ve had for the last few weeks and how I was 100% certain I had a brain tumor. Well, I swallowed my anxiety today and took my ass to the ER because it was getting debilitating. They did a CT scan of my head that came back 100% normal! The health anxiety part of my brain is telling me CT scans can miss stuff, but I trust my doctors, the likelihood of the scan missing something as drastic as a brain tumor is highly unlikely, and I know if something was abnormal, I wouldn’t be at home right now writing this post. \n\nMy blood pressure was high and they said my headaches are likely chronic tension headaches that were aggravated by my anxiety causing high blood pressure. But I’m in the clear, and I’m so relieved.\n\nTake it from me, yall. Anxiety is a beast and can cause such horrible physical symptoms, especially if it’s prolonged. Just try to take control of it and do whatever you need to do to calm your mind. It’s so worth the relief.",

Do a puzzle or color, we are never too old to enjoy things like puzzles and coloring books. \n\nAvoid google for an hour. One hour will become two, then it'll be a half a day. Soon it'll be a full day, and before you know it, a week will have gone by and guess what? I bet you feel a little more calm than what you would have if you'd spent that last week doing nothing but googling. \n\nYou will probably have setbacks. I know I did. I went three weeks before, did a \"harmless\" google search a week ago. But here's the thing about Health Anxiety... There's no such thing as a harmless google search. It will suck you in, it will dig in tight with its claws, and it won't let you go until you are having your panic attack. And then it will cause you to either continue to panic, or do what I did and make an panicky emergency doctor's appointment about something I swear I had, only to find out... I'm completely fine. All thanks to what started off as a harmless google search that spiraled into a dark area.\n\nBut you can pull yourself out, and move on from that setback. Don't beat yourself up about it, but instead, use that experience as a chance to learn. Move forward, try again. \n\nSo, trust me. Stop googling, please. We can beat this, we are all strong enough. \n\nNow, as for that reward... I still need ideas :p",

    "selftext": "I’m on mobile so can’t link to my other post but you’ll see my initial post about this a few months ago in my history. \n\nTo sum up, about 7-8 months ago, I began getting dizzy spells out of the blue. Vertigo, and then a constant feeling of swaying/off balance. \n\nI flipped out. My HA was through the roof. I saw three doctors, who diagnosed me with some inner ear problem and assured me it would go away eventually. I didn’t believe them though and was convinced I had a brain tumour or MS or something. \n\nThe anxiety destroyed me. I couldn’t sleep, eat, enjoy life. I was suicidal at one point because I just felt panicky all the time and couldn’t stand the feeling of being off balance. Sometimes there were triggers for it, sometimes it just happened. It was every day though and caused me so much stress. \n\nAfter 3 months, I got an MRI, bloodwork and CT scan. I was terrified but glad I got them. They all came back normal! It was such a relief.\n\nI went to see a vestibular physiotherapist who performed some tests and agreed with the doctors that it was an inner ear issue (he thinks BPPV). He told me that everyone heals at a different rate, and to do exercises to help retrain my brain to not get dizzy so easily. \n\nIt’s been around 7-8 months since this started, and things are a lot better. It’s not gone, but the exercises helped a lot and I no longer fear the dizzy sensation all the time.\n\nIf I had just trusted my doctors in the first place with their initial diagnosis, I could’ve saved myself so much grief and pain. I’m going to do my best from now on to listen to what they say. And stay off Google!! I have successfully avoided this, even though I’ve had other small health scares pop up. I’ve learned that the less I talk about it (ideally not at all), and with no Google/body scanning that the anxiety comes and goes quickly. \n\nAnyways, just wanted to post this for anyone else who may have similar symptoms. All was normal with me and it very likely is for you too! Obviously check with a doctor if you’re unsure, but if they tell you you’re fine then you are!\n\nOh, and the anxiety absolutely made my symptoms WAY worse. It would sometimes happen on its own, but once I stopped obsessing over it all the time it was far more mild and less frequent.",

    "title": "The Importance of Building Evidence: Why I most likely don't have ALS or cancer or DVT or heart disease, and why you probably don't either.",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone. This will be a long post, but I think it will also be a helpful one for those of you who are struggling to cope or have not yet had access to CBT. I am not a therapist, nor am I attempting to counsel. However, I have learned some strategies in therapy that are slowly helping me, and I thought for those who have not heard these, perhaps they could be of use.\n\n I'd like to start by saying that I do not subscribe to this sub. I did for a while, and I found that it actually fed my health anxiety. Constantly seeing posts by people who were seeking reassurance would always put a new and frightening illness on my radar. So now, I occasionally check back when I am in a deep state of anxiety. The key difference, however, between checking then and checking now, is what I'm looking for. \n\nWhen I used to look at the sub, it was because I too was seeking reassurance. I wanted to know what others were struggling with, if my symptoms matched up with other peoples symptoms and if I discovered a new ailment along the way, well then great, I could add another to the long list of things that would kill be before I turned 25 (next April). \n\nWhen I look at this sub now, however, I don't look to the posts; I look to the comments. I am not seeking reassurance, but rather **evidence**. In CBT, my therapist has been working with me on the importance of building evidence, both for AND against the disease I am concerned about at that moment. I give you an example.\n\nA snapshot of me right now:\n\n**Age:** 24  \n**Gender:** Male  \n**Medical History:** Nothing significant  \n**Family History:** bowel cancer and melanoma (however, these are not relevant to my current state of anxiety)  \n**Current symptoms:**  \n\\- aching pain in my left leg for the last 6 weeks - am now getting pain in both legs on alternating days  \n\\- muscle twitches (fasciculations) in both legs, primarily above the knee, but all over and in other areas of my body  \n\\- slight weakness in my sore legs and my left arm  \n**Testing/treatment I have had done regarding these symptoms:**  \n\\- lumbar MRI (clear with minor wear and tear)  \n\\- X-Ray (left leg) (awaiting results)  \n\\- regular physiotherapy visits, treating for referred pain from back  \n**What I'm afraid of:**  \n\\- ALS/MND/MS  \n\\- Bone cancer\n\nFor a couple of weeks I was a MESS. I was having panic attacks that I had ALS/MND. My muscle twitches were going haywire. I couldn't sleep. I was getting tingles down my leg and left arm. Then I started to actually pay attention to my therapist, and some helpful commentors on this sub. Below is what my evidence for and against all of these things looks like:\n\n**Evidence that I DO have ALS:**\n\n\\- I have muscle twitches, which is a symptom of ALS  \n\\- Muscular pain is sometimes a symptom of ALS  \n\\- I feel some minor weakness (but nothing that stops me walking or grasping things) in my sore legs and arm.\n\n**Evidence that I DO NOT have ALS:**\n\n\\- I am 24 years old - most cases of this disease occur in people over 40, and often, closer to 60.  \n\\- I have no family history. While most cases of ALS occur in people with no family history, almost ALL cases in people below 30 or 40 are familial related.  \n\\- Muscle twitches - while there are exceptions as with anything - are usually a later stage symptom of the disease.   \n\\- There is very little medical study into muscle twitches because they are considered to be of little medical significance. In other words, they are SO common and have hundreds of causes (plus hundreds more that doctors likely do not know about), all of which are FAR more likely than ALS, this symptom alone means little to nothing. A quote I saw online, but cannot remember where, said, 'Remember, muscle twitches are common, ALS is not.'  \n\\- The prevalence of ALS is about 1 or 2 in 100, 000. That's only between 10 and 20 in every 1, 000, 000. Or between 100 and 200 in every 20, 000, 000 people. Those numbers are pretty good.  \n\\- Generally before other symptoms, people will experience clinical weakness in their limbs, i.e. unable to walk properly, unable to hold a mug. Not just tripping, minor losses in dexterity or even minor foot dragging/tripping.   \n\\- I have been clumsy my ENTIRE LIFE. It's a running joke between my girlfriend and I about how clumsy I am.  \n\\- the weakness and soreness in my left arm is probably from a tendinitis injury I have struggled with on and off for the last 5 years.\n\n**Evidence that I DO have bone cancer:**\n\n\\- my legs hurt.\n\n**Evidence that I DO NOT have bone cancer:**\n\n\\- I had a lumbar MRI come back clean, meaning nothing in lymphatic system, nothing in my spinal column, no tumours causing referred pain  \n\\- no family history  \n\\- I have had an x-ray and while I do not yet have the results, if they come back negative, that's about as conclusive as you can get.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll we need to do is look at the evidence. I probably don't have ALS or bone cancer. It's far more likely that I have some mechanical fault in my legs or a muscular issue that will probably resolve with some physiotherapy.\n\nTrue, there are no absolutes in life. True, I COULD have one of these horrible diseases. Nobody on planet Earth can guarantee I or anybody else doesn't. But, the statistical likelihood of me having these ailments is so minuscule that it isn't even worth worrying about. And I know telling a person with health anxiety not to worry about health is like telling a dog not to smell another dog's butt and I'd be lying if I said this was a cure for my anxiety. It isn't. I still have low days and I still have weak moments. But what this has helped  with is coping on a day-to-day basis.\n\nI won't tell you not to Google, because I know that won't stop you. But I will say (a) limit the amount you do and (b) if you do Google, don't just search symptoms and match yours to whatever horrible thing comes up. Instead, look for **evidence.** Look for statistics in your age bracket. Look for ties to family history and hereditary links. And most of all, remind yourself that it's okay to get anxious, but it isn't okay to let that anxiety rule over you and ruin your day, week, month or existence. \n\nI hope this was helpful for those who had time to read it.",

    "selftext": "I wanted to share some mantras and quotes that have helped me in my journey with anxiety:\n\n* Feelings are not facts.\n* Am I observing the situation accurately, or am I projecting how I feel onto what is happening?\n* Inhale courage, exhale anxiety.\n* We do not see things as they are, we see things as we are.\n* Mindfulness helps us get better at seeing the difference between what's happening and the stories we tell ourselves.\n* Make the distinction between a real problem and an imagined scenario that hasn't happened yet.\n* Don't believe every worried thought you have - worried thoughts are notoriously inaccurate.\n* Our greatest weapon against stress is the ability to choose one thought over another.\n* Feelings are much like waves; we can't stop them from coming, but we can decide which ones to surf.\n* Worrying won't stop bad things from happening, it just stops you from enjoying the good.\n* We either make ourselves miserable or we make ourselves strong, the amount of work is the same.\n* I will breathe. I will think of solutions. I will not let my worry control me. I will not let my stress break me. I will simply breathe. And it will be okay, because I don't quit.\n* I have managed this before, and I can manage it again.\n* I am present within myself. I can center myself with the ease of my breath. I feel grounded, confident, healthy, and whole.\n* With every breath, I release the anxiety within me and I become more and more calm.\n* You are not weak for needing time to sort through this.\n* Interrupt anxiety with gratitude.\n* I am choosing to believe that the future can still be beautiful. \n* At the end of the day, we can endure much more than we think we can.\n* What we see depends mainly on what we look for.\n* The body benefits from movement, the mind benefits from stillness.\n* If it can be solved, there's no need to worry, and if it can't be solved, worry is of no use.\n* Life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react to it.\n* It is not necessary to react to everything you notice.\n* We are what we repeatedly do. What we dwell on is who we become.\n* Fear is a reaction, courage is a decision.\n* A bird sitting on a tree is never afraid of the branch breaking, because his trust is not in the branch, but in his own wings. \n* 99% of the things you worry about don't even happen.\n\nI hope at least some of these resonate with you. I keep them in a list on my phone to reference when I'm struggling. I'm always looking for new mantras and quotes to add, so if you have any that have been particularly helpful for  you, please share them!",

    "selftext": "When I was a kid and complained about little things that hurt when I poked and prodded myself, my dad would say, \"well then dont do that.\" And his joke was always something along the lines of, \"***it hurts when I poke myself in the eye with a pencil... so I went to my doctor, and he told me that the cure was to stop doing that***.\" He's always been good at using humor to cheer me up and to gently point out when I'm being foolish.\n\nAnyway, I tend to think about it and get a chuckle when I see some posts on this sub. The truth is that if we go searching for something to worry about, we'll always find it. No body is flawless and painless. The checking behavior causes far more damage to our mental health than it could ever benefit our physical health. \n\nIf you are a \"body checker,\" I encourage you to take steps to break that cycle for the sake of your mental health.

They have a genetic disposition to the disease, or an illness that predisposes them, or environmental factors at play. The likelihood for the average person is even lower.

    "title": "A letter from a fellow Hypochondriac: ACCEPT YOUR ROLE",
    "selftext": "Hi,\n\nMy name is Miguel, i'm a long time lurker of this subreddit. I originally joined for the same reason many of you did, to seek some comfort for my struggles with hypochondria.\n\nI'm going to be completely honest here, I don't find this subreddit very helpful in it's current state. The way it operates though, makes perfect sense. This is what happens when you have a gathering of people suffering with health anxiety, you get posts from men and women who are seeking relief. Posts filled with fear, coming from someone who just wants somebody to tell them it's all going to be ok.\n\nI'm a 31 year old male, and I consider myself to be a recovering hypochondriac. Meaning, while I do struggle with certain thought patterns every now and then (and always will, but we'll get to that later), I am in a much better position now than I was years ago. Today I decided i'm going to attempt to truly help most of you lurking here, by telling you what you need to hear. I could say the world is cruel, unfair and i'm just trying to make it a little bit less shitty by easing your suffering. Though one could say i'm just doing this for the purpose of self gratification, I don't believe both are incompatible. And quite frankly, who cares? I know YOU don't.\n\nI'm going to start by giving you guys some context, by telling you about my story with hypochondria.\n\nFor me it began around 5 years ago, and while I certainly believe this is something that has always been within my mind, I have no doubt the catalyst was my regular use of Cannabis. Weed provided my life with many positive aspects. A boost in creativity, which benefited my job as a YouTuber. A source of motivation, since I would only smoke at night (1-3 joints) after a day of work, it was a great \"reward\" for me. It also helped me learn more about myself, by enhancing my self-awareness I was able to notice certain nasty aspects of my personality I have slowly but surely worked on since then (this is important for my job as a public figure, where unfortunately people's general perception of me can make or break my career).\n\nMarijuana ended up becoming a double edged sword, though. It turns out, casual use of recreational cannabis has multiple beneficial effects, yet regular daily use for a long period of time will ALWAYS lead to negative results. Though the degree of this varies from person to person. For me it was pretty bad. At first it was the enhanced self-awareness. It's not hard to envision that becoming a problem with time, as it led to a point in which I was way too harsh on myself. The more aware I became of the many flaws within my personality, which manifested in my daily conduct, the more self deprecating I became. My body was also physically affected by the prolongued over estimulation of my endo cannabinoid system, people who enjoy Marijuana will try to deny this, but our endo cannabinoid system is not meant to be stimulated or \"lied to\" on a daily basis. I would start shaking every time I smoked a joint, feel nausea and that would only harm my mind even further.\n\nI studied biology in college, and I since then i've had a fascination towards cellular biology (this includes genetics, biochemistry, etc). I became aware of the scary fact that the human body is comprised of TRILLIONS of cells. While this may just be \"fascinating\" to most, to me it was terrifying, and ultimately, this knowledge is where my health anxiety stems from.\n\nWhy is this frightening to me? Quite simply because this led me to a clear conclusion: I am a house that has no control over the very bricks which i'm made of.\n\nThis notion felt... unnacceptable to me. Here I am, a conscious being brought onto this world, and you're telling me that within my very essence, the concept of \"one\" is nothing but an illusion? I'm made of countless tiny pieces, and ANY of them could one day betray me? \n\nFu\\*\\*. Me.\n\nAs my weed induced paranoia grew, this perspective that I had developed over the course of my young adult life grew stronger and stronger, and that's when hell broke loose.\n\nThis was the genesis of my cancer phobia.\n\nMy first \"episode\" was a pericarditis I contracted in a castle in Warsaw, where I was working as a caster for an esports event. There was a viral outbreak (half of the crew got sick) and I felt lucky until I got back home and had pain in my heartbeat. From then onwards, things only got worse. I would reach the worst conclusion possible for every unpleasant symptom I felt.\n\nBrain fog? Brain cancer.  \nBack pain? Spinal cancer.  \nAssymetrical clavicles? Bone cancer.  \nDiscomfort in my abdomen while lying down? A tumor taking up space somewhere within.  \nPupils of different sizes? Clearly a brain tumor.\n\nI could go on and on.\n\nI spent a couple of years going to the doctor every time I felt something was \"off\". Which was pretty much all the time hahaha\n\nOne day, I was walking outside and I saw this dog. It was running around in circles with the most genuine happy look in it's face and I remember thinking to myself... how I envy this idiot. A dog doesn't worry about the bricks it's comprised of. A dog doesn't know, a dog doesn't care. A dog can just focus on what they NEED to focus on, which is to find food, water and just enjoy life.\n\nI sought help, reached out to a therapist who helped me to a degree which is hard to properly express. Not only did he teach me to ACCEPT these feelings, to accept fear in my life. He also pointed me in the right direction, so I could research the right sources and broaden my perspective on life.\n\nYou see, it turns out you are NOT the house. You are the consciousness emanating from a multicellular organism. You are the dance, your body is the dancer.\n\nWhat i'm going to do now is help PUT YOU IN YOUR PLACE. Explain to you why you have no business reaching premature conclusions, no matter how TRUTHFUL THEY FEEL. \"It's all makes sense, my symptoms aline\".\n\nBullsh\\*t.\n\nYou are not your brain either. Like I said, you are the dance. What does this mean? Envision YOU as an individual in a room, sitting on a chair with a bunch of monitors in front of you. Those monitors are your thoughts. Your brain is constantly throwing them your way, yet that is all the brain is doing. YOU decide which screens, aka thoughts, you want to pay attention to.\n\nPeople like us spend most of the day staring at the same screen. The negative health thoughts. We feel some kind of weird symptom (which is 99.9% of the time caused by the damage your body takes from being in a constant state of stress by the way) and spend our entire day staring at that monitor. I know what you just focused on in that last phrase, don't you think I don't. \"What about the 0.1% of the time\"? Shut up. Stop. You are not the 0.1% and deep down you know this.\n\nSo what do I do?\n\nYou don't step out of the hypochondria loop by fully ignoring these thoughts either. You embrace your role as the person in the room filled with monitors. You see the thought, you acknowledge it and then you focus your attention on another screen. You do this as many times as you need to. Never deny the presence of theses thoughts, just nod and then focus on something else. Something that will be more worthy of your time. \n\nI said earlier that it is not your place to focus on these sorts of thoughts. I say this because it is completely and utterly pointless. Your brain carries an amigdala with an archaic design, if compared to your frontal cortex. This part of your brain DOES NOT UNDERSTAND hypochondriac thoughts and obsessions. This part of the brain only understands one thing: THERE IS A THREAT.\n\nWhat does it do in the face of such a threat? It releases a bunch of harmful chemicals onto your blood stream that enhance certain physical traits, at the expense of physiological self harm. These chemicals cause ALL KINDS of crazy symptoms. For me some of them include: red dots on my hands accompanied with a sensation similar to that of having a bunch of needles poking at them, numbness on the left side of my face, vertigo, dizziness, feeling as though i'm running out of air, sweaty hands, nausea, brain fog, tension headaches, feeling of weakness in my legs, ringing in my ears, stomach pain, rib pain, the sensation that i'm going to faint at any given moment, and a loooong etc.\n\nTheses side effects only enhance your fears, your sense of doom. This triggers the amigdala even further and there you have it: and endless cycle of physical and mental suffering that never seems to end. \n\nHell.\n\nI'm going to help you, the dance, understand your role in life, in regards to the rest of your body. \n\nJust as your lungs provide you with oxygen, your heart pumps blood, your stomach dissolves food and your kidneys filter out toxic waste, you, the consciouness have certain duties assigned to you.\n\nIn order to help keep the organism functioning, you have to find and consume food and water, and then mate. \n\nThat's it. Well, that would be it for most animals, but our brains have evolved to a degree to which, thanks to our ever growing knowledge, we are capable of controlling more.\n\nHygiene, smart dieting, exercise to keep the muscles active and encourage development are amongst many things we can do to improve our quality of life. There's more to that though, as a conscious entity, we are here to EXPERIENCE the world around us. To find the intrigue and joy within this planet, to learn, to teach, to provide for others as you provide for yourself.\n\nThis is your place. \n\nControlling your cells so that they don't rebel, that is not your place. That job is up to your immune system, who will ALWAYS do a much better job at it than any doctor in the planet. Doctors are there to HELP your body keep you going. They are aides. It is up to your own organism to keep you alive, because like you that is what your entire body DESIRES.\n\nTRUST your body. It is orders of magnitude more resilient, effective and intelligent than you think it is.\n\nBy letting negative thoughts take over your life, you are SABOTAGING YOURSELF. You are only making it more difficult for your organism to function like it's supposed to, and you are effectively dying of worry over something that is completely out of your control.\n\nThere are some benefits to HAVING BEEN a hypochondriac. You are more sensitive to unpleasant corporal symptoms. This means that once you get over yourself trying to control everything and just LET GO, whenever there is something that truly needs to be looked at, you'll have an easier time \"noticing\" compared to others.\n\nWhat they don't tell you about many terminal diseases is that many people affected by them go on to ignore really scary symptoms for a long period of time. We all know that if anybody here ever sees BUT A DROP of blood in their toilet, they are in the ER within 15 minutes. Believe it or not a lot of people go on years without even paying attention to stuff like this.\n\nUnless you are genetically predisposed to a certain disease, odds of you having a heart attack for example before 45 are pretty much zero. Again, your body is TOUGH. Think about all the people who spend years destroying themselves with hardcore drugs, only to recover and end up living long lives.\n\nSome day, you will get truly ill, and you will die. It will happen to every single human being on this planet. That being the case, is it truly such a terrible thing? We are all connected by fate. We don't know what happens afterwards, but going back to where we came from, cannot possibly be such a bad destiny if you ask me.\n\nBREATHE. Look at the world around you, how amazing the fact that we are even here to begin with is. Make use of your time, fulfill YOUR ROLE as the consciousness, LET GO and trust your body to fulfill theirs.\n\nBe like that dog running around smiling, be happy with your role. \n\nEmbrace it. Your organs will embrace theirs, for as long as they can.\n\nYou are not alone, and you never truly will be.\n\nLove,\n\nA fellow hypochondriac.",

    "selftext": "In my ongoing saga that started here: https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/m5yfz1/im_really_struggling_with_colon_cancer_worries/\n\n**Quick rundown:**\n35 white male with on/off rectal bleeding since I was 19. Blood is usually bright red (sometimes appears maroon) and is often visible on the toilet paper, dripping into the bowl following a bowel movement, and/or coating/streaking the stool.\n\nIn February 2020, had a particularly painful bowel movement and since then have been experiencing varying degrees of bleeding plus pain. (Initially, pain was with each bowel movement, and now it usually presents more like burning/itching for a couple hours following.)\n\nIn February 2021, experienced a round of bleeding that suddenly triggered my health anxiety. I developed the following symptoms in addition to bleeding:\n\n* Abdominal pain/cramping/vague discomfort\n* More frequent stools (going from once every day to multiple times a day)\n* Loose stools\n* Thinner stools\n* Change in stool color (yellow, orange)\n* Passing mucus with stool\n* More frequent diarrhea, occasionally bloody\n* Loss of appetite\n* Weight loss (10 lbs. in a week)\n\nAll signs seemed to point to colon cancer.\n\n**SPOILERS: I do not have colon cancer.**\n\nAfter months of waiting, months of worrying, months of Googling and reading Reddit posts and scouring this subreddit (plus other subreddits, like the colon cancer and cancer subreddits), I finally had my colonoscopy today. The prep, while unpleasant, was pretty straightforward to deal with. The procedure itself was a breeze. What I was really nervous for were the results. I was in tears multiple times this past week worrying about what I’d find out. I almost started crying as I left my wife to go into the prep area today. What were they going to tell me when I woke up?\n\nWell… I have hemorrhoids. I also have two large growths near my rectum called multilobed hypertrophic anal papillae, which are essentially skin tags that developed as a result of chronic fissures. The doc biopsied them to check for infection, and he also biopsied my colon in multiple areas to check for microscopic colitis, but his words: “Otherwise, things looks pretty normal. Nothing looks like cancer.”\n\nThat’s it. No cancer. Not even a polyp. I lost my mind to worry for half a year because of some hemorrhoids and skin tags. Every single reassuring post helped inch me closer to rationality, but every horror story about “I was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer and I HAD NO SYMPTOMS at 29 years old” brought me crashing back down. I convinced myself I was going to be a statistic.\n\nWell don’t I feel silly…\n\nAnyway, I hope this helps reassure someone, but having been in your shoes, the best thing you can do is treat your anxiety. I wasted so much time letting Google and the horror stories rule my life—it was wholly unproductive. The only good thing that came out of all that worrying was focusing more on treating my anxiety. I’m on Buspirone now, and I feel so much different, so much better, than I have before. The colonoscopy was my last step, and I’m glad I did it, but I’m more glad that I’m on an actual treatment path for the underlying anxiety. I couldn’t keep living that way.\n\nBest of luck to all. Take care.",

It was crushing my life. \n\nI’m here to tell you that you are NOT alone in your fight to regain control of your life. And it IS possible to overcome. \n\nSome things to keep in mind:\n\n- The human body is very resilient. It will unmistakably tell you in a number of ways if it is seriously compromised. Not every little ache and pain is worthy of a trip to the doctor. \n- DO NOT GOOGLE. One more time for the people in the back: no googling! Seriously. Listen to your body, not WebMD. \n- Be upfront with yourself about your anxiety. When you want to let your anxiety consume your mind, you need to make a conscious effort to remove yourself from the situation. Take a walk, play with your dog, call a friend. Get your mind off of it ASAP. \n- Face your fears. This one is tried and true. \n- Know that you are not crazy. You are not the first person to have these thoughts, and it is possible to recover. \n- Pick up a new healthy hobby to occupy your mind. Think: cooking, meditation, yoga, painting, etc. \n- Death is something that has to happen to all of us, and each of our days will come. Instead of worrying about it every day, remind yourself that you need to actually enjoy the ride while you’re here!\n\nI know this is all easier said than done, but trust me you can overcome your HA.

    "selftext": "Last year at this time I thought...no I knew...that I was dying. I had again convinced myself that I had a terminal illness and I had months, maybe a year to live. This time, it was end stage renal disease.\n\nAfter suffering though multiple health scares (brain cancer, MS, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, diabetes, esophageal cancer, and more), you’d think I would have been able to recognize the pattern. Every time I was cleared by my doctor and told that I was healthy, I would ultimately conjure up a new worry. \n\n———————————\n\nEarlier this year I started seeing a therapist because I wanted to confide in someone about this “illness” and gain the strength to finally make a doctor’s appointment, get an official diagnosis, break this terrible news to my family, and start to cope with the fact that I was dying at the age of 32.\n\nSomething very different happened. We talked about my childhood. My alcoholic parents. My abusive step-father. The absence of my real father. Neglect. Depression. Isolation. And she also encouraged me to make the damn doctor’s appointment!\n\nTerrified was an understatement. The days leading up to my appointment, I couldn’t eat, couldn’t sleep, or even pay attention at work. It was sheer torture.\n\nOne very long week after my appointment, I got a call from my doctor’s office. I saw the number come through on my cell phone: “Dr. Garner.” My heart sank. I sat down, took a deep breath, and braced myself for “THE news.”\n\n“Hello, Amy. We have the results of your lab work.”\n\nOH, SHIT.\n\n“Your kidney function was normal. Thyroid, sugars, B12, cholesterol was also normal. We will see you back in one year. Have a nice day.”\n\nI wasn’t dying. Again.\n\n———————————\n\nFlash forward to 8 months later. I am still in therapy and now have the tools and support to manage my HA. Yes I still struggle daily, especially during a global pandemic. But now if I have a genuine concern, I don’t sit with it for months or years...I deal with it immediately and put those fears to bed.\n\nSo I wrote all this to say that I made a huge huge step today. I scheduled a preconception visit with my OB/GYN. I never thought I’d be healthy enough to have a baby, let alone live long enough to raise a child. My hubs and I are elated! I pray that all of you who are struggling right now will get the help that you deserve. Love you all!❤️",

    "title": "HEALTH ANXIETY SUCKS... BUT IT GET'S EASIER. TRIGGER WARNING",
    "selftext": "Hi, I have had health anxiety for around 3 years and I know the feeling. It consumes your life. Every waking minute is a constant \"What If\" Scenario. I have made my own life and the life of those around me a misery and It's unrelenting! However, These are the things that took the edge for me (Baring in mind I still have awful weeks) But overall I am less worried all the time. \n\n1. DO NOT GOOGLE SYMPTOMS - This is a NO BRAINER, Googling symptoms will make you aware of diseases and ailments that kill 1/1000000000000 Per year and us (Being Hypochondriacs) Will convince ourselves we have this rare disease. I once convinced myself I had a brain eating Amoeba from doing a Neti Pot....... See.\n\n 2. Seek medical help or at the very least speak to a professional who can give you some anxiety reducing medication.Many with Health anxiety have OCD tendencies and without assistance in coping with these obsessive thought patterns beating Health anxiety is a lot harder.\n\n3. Eat healthy AF! This in turn will make you feel better, make you sleep better and also make the one thing you don't trust (Your body) Work better. Then this will restore your faith in your bodies ability to look after itself.\n\n4.STAY BUSY!! I don't care if your jobless, homeless, on drugs or a serial killer with health anxiety. You have to stay busy! Rumination is the first step to obsession.\n\n5. Play the odds game. What I mean is look at the odds of you having said particular lines/disease etc. I know its almost impossible but this really does help.\n\n6. F\\*\\*K \"WHAT IF?!\" This is the one thing I still struggle with now. \"What If I am the 1 in 98636466672527252278263436 people that gets a brain eating amoeba?!\" \" WHAT IF I do have an undiagnosed condition that all the doctors (Possibly around 40) At this point have missed\"? \"What if Google is somehow more knowledgeable than a trained medical professional who has trained for like seven years ?!\" \"WHAT IF I am in fact going to die soon?!\"This question is like saying what if you were born as a snail? It's completely pointless and will not play any hand in helping you or making you happy.\n\n7. STOP CHECKING YOUR BODY FOR LUMPS/BUMPS & OR SENSATIONS. The mind is amazing at becoming sensitive to particular things if you focus on it enough. If you notice a headache, don't immediately jump on Dr Google and start searching because according to DR Google you are in fact dying from a brain tumour.... You are not. It is a headache and the more you worry about it the longer it will persist. Anxiety attributes to SOOOOO many bodily sensations and \"Symptoms\" It's unreal! So please, give yourself a 5 minute window (If you really must check your body) But DO NOT check outside of the window. I mean, how likely is the symptom or lump or bump going to change from when you checked it in your window? Not much. If you do have something that is particularly worrying you then Go to a doctor, but when he/she tells you that you are probably fine, BELIEVE THEM!!\n\n8. Remember that Medical professionals know A LOT more about medical things than Google does. Or more specifically, They know what to look for when it comes to you as an individual. An example, I have always had bad posture and a sore back because I am tall and have so many sports injuries its unreal. I have seen so many physios and doctors who all blame my bad posture and this for my sore neck and headaches (Which is true) .But I being a health Anxiety sufferer instead believed it was MS or osteoporosis and drove myself insane obsessing and doubting the professionals diagnosis. \n\n9. STOP SEEKING REASSURANCE FROM NON PROFESSIONALS. This is a tough one to stop. I still struggle so much with this one because the brief reassurance you get in the midst of terrible health anxiety episode is so nice. For a very short time you think \"Maybe they are right\". Then after 4 seconds your anxiety hat goes back on and it does nothing to reassure you at all. So basically, It's completely pointless to seek reassurance from friends or family because unless they are doctors and have the tools to perform copies amounts of tests you will not believe them. Instead, If yo are worried about something go to the doctors and get tests done. When they come back normal, believe the tests and move on. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n10. This is not permanent. I can promise you that you will one day get over being so obsessed over your own health. It might take months, years or decades but you will win. How do I know? I was pretty much housebound for two years due to my irrational fear of me just dropping to the floor with a brain aneurysm. I barely saw friends or family and often called in work sick because I was so worried. Now, I am still anxious as I am just a worrying kinda guy but after being put on Sertraline, changing my diet, exercising and staying busy my health anxiety has took a back seat. It's still there but I AM THE ONE NOW DRIVING. Before my Health anxiety was driving the car and I was a mere passenger. My goal is to one day have my health anxiety a few cars back stuck in traffic. You can do it but all it takes is belief, hard work and self love.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMuch Love\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP",

I worked hard labor when I wasn't in school. I laughed at pain and was a daredevil.       \n\nMy naive young self always thought no matter what happened to my health, if it got to a point I couldn't work then I would be taken care of. After all, we are in a first world country and being the type that would push myself until I collapse, it should be a no-brainer that I would qualify for help should something happen.  I felt safe and was blissfully ignorant.          \n\nThen I got older and realized health insurance is ridiculously expensive. Ok then, at least I'd *still* get amazing care should something happen, but stopped being adventurous because that's just being frivolous with money at that point.             \n\nThen as an adult I got sick. Really really sick. Doctors didn't really seem concerned. I was pissing blood, pale, high fever,.. they gave me some antibiotics and 2 days off work. I came into work still sick, and collapsed. ER told me I fainted from low blood pressure. They didn't give me any fluids just told me to follow up with my dr.  \nI still had to go back to work the next day, as they didn't give me time off and my dr appointment was 3 days later.   \n\nDr basically told me to suck it up and drink more water. Alright then. The fevers and blood pissing eventually stopped but I started fainting randomly and going into convulsions. Once again shrugs from doctors. \n\n\nI was scared I was dying. Constantly dizzy, fainting, severe abdominal pains, and was in a huge amount of debt with doctors that didn't want to breathe in my general direction so I started getting anxiety and depression.      \n\nI thought maybe if I brought up how this is now causing panic attacks they would take it more seriously. They tried to give me ssris but it just made it 100x worse  to where I was going to lose my job. I asked them if they could just help me figure the problem out as my anxiety stems from their apathy and they ended up using my GAD diagnosis to explain everything that's happened in the past. I started to believe them, after all they're doctors \"do no harm\". Made myself actually go crazy thinking I was doing this for attention or from stress.     \n\n\nI remember sliding down my wall at home and just sitting on the floor in shock. It finally hit me. The realization of how everything runs here, and the social safety net that doesn't actually exist. Our medical system painted in gold but rotten on the inside.     \n\nI'm just glad the pandemic has shown some light on how unstable the quality of care is here. Hope others that just realized this know it's always been this way and now their walls they were hiding behind are down.",

This is a heart attack\" it spread to my left arm and felt a bit of jaw pressure so I woke up my dad and called 911 ASAP. The ambulance arrived and they hooked me on the EKG and saw my blood pressure and said everything looked normal and it most likely was just anxiety, that I shouldn't worry because I am pretty young at 22 years old. Ever since then these types of panic attacks started to become more apparent and terrified me everytime since I was scared I'd drop dead. Sometimes I also get real dizzy, and one day it got so bad I went to the hospital to make sure everything is alright and once again the EKG and blood (both pressure and sugar) came out normal. The next few days I went to my doctor and he checked up on me and said everything sounded normal. But the thought in my head was still that they might have missed something, I am pretty obese and am now working on lowering my weight and changing to a more healthier diet. But sometimes my anxiety gets so bad I am CONVINCED something is wrong, I get brief moments of vertigo that comes and goes that is enough to make me jump and convince myself that I am dying. I linked so many things to heart health that I am worrying family members. I got another major attack this thursday that made me call 911 AGAIN and once again everything came out fine, I still get anxiety attacks and feel heart attack symptoms sometimes but I know the road to a full mental recovery will take a bit of time.

    "selftext": "Hi there. \nI’ve seen this sub a lot from people who frequently come to my cancer’s sub (which is a support group lol please don’t come there asking for us to diagnose you.) \nI am a graduate nurse with a background in the ER as well as a stage 2 unfavorable Hodgkin’s Lymphoma survivor. \nI know that health anxiety is a really serious obstacle to overcome, and I just want to offer some reassurance from both a patient and provider standpoint. \nFirst off, let me start by saying that bad things do happen. Obviously-I got a rare cancer. However, a lot of the things that may seem absolutely detrimental to you are actually not too big of a deal. \nI’ve seen people stressed about food poisoning from eating something strange, racing heart rates, thyroid issues, and even cancer. As a cancer survivor and someone in poor health, I am here to say that these things aren’t that bad. Even cancer isn’t too terrible. Yes, it sucked, but I saw someone say that they would immediately kill themselves if they had cancer. That’s a bit extreme considering the fact that most cancers are pretty treatable even in the most advanced stages, so why jump the gun there? Of course, you already know that Dr. Google will give you a death sentence immediately. However, the real world isn’t like that. \nFrom a medical professional standpoint, it’s also important to remember how resilient bodies are made to be. Eating a piece of food that wasn’t perfectly cooked will likely not harm you at all. If anything, you’ll spend a couple of hours in the bathroom. Your body has a superb immune system made to fight off things that come into your body and don’t belong there. That’s why you get symptoms from viruses (fevers actually make an environment that make it hard for bacteria and viruses to survive.) The lymphatic system is an amazing thing, and swelling of lymph nodes is reassuring that it’s working! Your lymph nodes work like a filtering sponge, so they clean anything and everything that doesn’t belong inside of you! Having a swollen one is typically a sign that your body is preventing you from getting sick, as it’s filled with lymph fluid that is cleaning your blood. \nWith that being said, I think it’s helpful to consider variations as well. Vital signs, for example, may differ from person to person. For example, my husband, an extremely active person, has a heart rate that hangs out in the 40s and 50s. It’s normal for him. Mine hangs out higher since I’m not anywhere near as active. Temperatures also fluctuate. Everyone wants to hear 98.6 as their temp, but that’s just not realistic. Your body has to adapt to the environment around it (it’s called homeostasis) to keep everything working well inside. Temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure work to compensate for any variation of your environment! Obviously extremely abnormal vitals should be monitored, but very few people are actually in that perfect range. \nAnother facet of variation comes in with people’s anatomy. I have a fat pad in my armpit (not cancer- it would have shown up on my PET scan.) my friends don’t have this fatty tissue, but that doesn’t mean it’s a bad thing. It’s just something that my body did. My husband has a small dent in his sternum, which is just something about his body (lots of people have them and they’re not a big deal). \nMy point here is that anatomical differences and vital sign variations exist for reasons that we may not understand. My other point is that your worst case scenario may not actually be that bad if it comes true. \nI hope this is helpful for at least one person. I will not be answering questions about my medical history or giving out medical advice considering the fact that I think it would be counter-productive to this post.",

    "title": "Health anxiety about bowel + colon cancer (SUPPORT)",
    "selftext": "I felt the need to write this post to support anybody who is going through a tough time over this. There will be 3 things I want to talk about and I hope you take on what I have to say as I’ve went through a very hard time so hopefully you don’t have to! Sorry for the VERY long post!!\nPLEASE READ LAST DOT POINTS TOO!\n\nSymptoms:\nI am 22 years old and had ongoing rectal bleeding, flat stools and the occasional stomach pain for the past 2 years. It was progressively getting better but just wouldn’t complete go away. It was always bright red but regardless of colour seeing blood on the toilet paper is always unsettling. I tend to have sore lower backs (also a symptom apparently) and would have bowel cramps every so often. \n\nAnxiety and self diagnosis:\nI convinced myself it was colon cancer and it made the last year and a half a literal living hell. Every decision I made was influenced by this and it took away real joy from my life for that entire time. I wasted my 22nd birthday and many other important memories over this. It was a vicious cycle of seeking reassurance off reddit, loved ones and medical professionals. Daily self talking, questioning and worrying. All I ever seemed to do was look for the negative in my symptoms. I’d always find a way to attract the worst possible outcome. I also had a friend my age who was disgnosed with colon cancer, even though our symptoms were different (he lost A LOT of weight) I still kept comparing him to me. No matter whether my symptoms were improving or not, the uncertainty always pushed me to breaking point. There is so much more to say on this topic and health anxiety behaviours, message me if you need to talk through it. \n\nDiagnosis + procedure:\nEven though I was told numerous times by doctors, specialists and family that I was 99% going to not have cancer, I’d already convinced myself otherwise. I had a conference call with a gastro specialist (due to covid) and was told based on my symptoms (listed above) and my age that this was 99% hemorrhoids, but they’d need to scope just in case there’s anything else. This “anything else” was something my anxiety played on, I was not confident enough to get the procedure so I saw my doctor. My doctor gave me a physical (finger) exam and found a couple hemmorhoids. I should’ve been relieved right? Yes and no. I was relieved for a day or so then the anxiety returned (as it always will if you don’t seek help!!) and thought what if there’s something else in my bowel too. My physiotherapist I visited told me I had a tight pelvic floor (causing thin stools). But Nothing would ease me until I had complete reassurance, so a rough 6 months later I decided to finally get the procedure done. I was told I needed to band my hemmorhoids (if any are found) and a colonoscopy to check for anything else. The procedure was in 2 weeks and my life was living hell until then. I walked around like I was on death row, expecting nothing but a BAD DIAGNOSIS. I know a lot of you are only here to read my symptoms and diagnosis for that temporary reassurance, but PLEASE read my diagnosis and ONWARDS because it’s your only way out of this vicious health anxiety cycle! The colonoscopy prep kinda sucked, I was really hungry but I got through it and actually felt nice to empty my bowels completely. It did cause slight bleeding due to the amount of bowel movements. The actual procedure was the easiest part (a part from the crippling anxiety). It was a breeze, I was put to sleep and it felt like one second later I was awake. I’d never been put under anaesthetic before so i was expecting a lot worse than that, dare I say the sleep was great haha! (If you have any questions about the procedure hit me up!) I woke up, I was seated and I kept over hearing everybody else get their results. A year and a half of anxiety lead to this moment. I kept wondering why are they stalling on my results? Am I sick and they’re preparing to tell me? Anyway, I’m happy to say that was the last IRRATIONAL thought I ever had on the subject of bowel cancer. I was told they banded three hemorrhoids and found no cancers or polyps. \n\nPlease read this next part, it’s crucial. \nMy advice is probably not going to be what you want to hear. But if you are like myself, and tend to have health anxiety episodes, this was my experience and I hope it helps you find the courage to do the same.\n\n- If you are endlessly scrolling through reddit and other health forums trying to look for reassurance, stop. It is single handedly the worst way to go about this. All this will do will make a 1% chance feel like your inevitable reality. It’s like putting a mental magnifying glass on the 1% chance, and completely warping your own minds sense of ACTUAL reality! \n\n- Seek help, therapy. I’ve put this before getting scoped as it turned out to be the real issue here for me. My therapist helped me realise I’m fearful of what I cannot control and having too much time on my hands has allowed me the time and energy to really focus on health issues. Therapy has helped my health anxiety and I feel I’m overcoming it more and more everyday . Everybody’s mental reasoning will be different but what I know is that regardless the reason talking about it can only help. Also try get a routine going and keep busy, it could help you too!\n\n-  Get scoped, chances are this will make everything seem so much more real but please let me tell you it’s okay. You’ll get through it and I’m sure you’ll be fine just like I was. 99% you will be fine actually! Even if they do find something (any abnormality, not just cancer) that is important as it’s better to get on top of it issues early! Especially if you’re around my age, even if the stars align something is found it’ll be very early stage so they’ll just remove it and you’ll get through it! So mentally and physically there’s no reason to stall! By the way I know you felt anxious when I said “even if there is something” ... classic health anxiety.\n\nI always told my self during that dreadful time that I’d come back to reddit and tell my story. Ironically to get other anxious people OFF reddit (symptom searching) and improving their mental and physical health. Searching symptoms is a strong symptom of health ANXIETY so you should be just as concerned about that as you are physical illness symptoms! \nI hope this helps in any way at all, if you have any questions or you just need to talk to someone message me or reply to this thread! \n\nThanks for reading !",

    "title": "How I overcame health anxiety (read this is your currently struggling)",
    "selftext": "So, i have been wanting to post this here but have been putting it off because this is going to be long so bare with me. If you want to know how I over came this bad disease keep reading, If your ready to recover keep reading. \n\nIt all started when I was 16. Nothing necessarily trigger this other then I got sick one time (fever, body aches), and it had been a few years since I had a check up when my mom said “you need to let me take you to the doctor for a check up because you won’t know if somethings wrong of you don’t”. So when I got sick I decided to google it to see what was wrong, and leukemia was the first thing that popped up. My heart dropped. From that moment I was a google fanatic and thought I had every disease in the book. I suddenly started experiencing symptoms of leukemia like fatigue, and flu like symptoms. \n\nThe after that I was worried I had a brain tumor. I had symptoms of that also, this was the worst one for me I think. I had a buzzing noise in my ear from time to time, blurred vision, fuzzy peripheral vision, headaches, pressure on the top of my head, slurred speech sometimes, nausea at time, etc. it was HORRIBLE. The symptoms were real. I was checked multiple times and I got a clean bill of health. \n\nThen I worried about skin cancer. I seen a dermatologist who confirmed I do NOT have skin cancer. \n\nI then found what I thought to be a lump in my abdomen and seen a doctor who said it’s nothing but she ordered a CT with contrast to shut me up. That was clear as well BUT did say I had a very slightly enlarged spleen which could have been caused by mono when I was younger. \n\nI had many blood panels, EKGS, echocardiograms, CT scans, X-rays, urine tests, I saw a chiropractor, a dermatologist, and many MDs before I finally decided to accept that this was a mental issue and I’m NOT ill. It took me 5 long frustrating, scary, years before I agreed I had an issue with worrying over my health for no good reason. I seen two counselors and they helped, but I knew the change had to be within me! \n\nI finally accepted the facts. Google is not the most reliable source. In fact, only 42% of the health info found on google IS accurate. So your pretty much seeking reassurance from a uneducated stranger rather then just seeing your dr and trusting their diagnosis. It’s hard to agree these symptoms are in your head, but they ARE! You can make yourself feel all sorts of crazy symptoms, so if you’ve seen a doctor and you have a good report, the only thing you should be googling is Health Anxiety symptoms and making sure your on a reliable website, such as webMD or Mayoclinic. Steer clear of yahoo answers, or any of the other forums that uneducated people  post on trying to give advice. In facts, steer clear of google and the web PERIOD! \n\nHere’s how I done it:\n\nI scheduled a check up and wrote down ALL of my concerns. I talked to my doctor about my issues with anxiety and how bad I was making myself worry. He told me I need to stay FAR AWAY from google all together and I followed his orders. I had him do a full check up, ekg, blood work, STD testing, you name it just to at last, put my mind at ease. Once that was over and I was confirmed healthy, I started finding stuff to do like working out, surrounding myself with friends, and I got a job! I would leave my phone in the car locked up when I went into work. For a period of time I only used my phone for calls and texts. When i did have the urge to google I’d find something else to do. Like go for a walk and talk to myself about all the tests I’ve had. After ALL of these test, it would be very unlikely something so sinister would be missed! I knew it was mental so I would be easy on myself. Cry if need be. But don’t check for lumps, don’t start Letting your mind wonder, keep yourself occupied at least for the first few weeks. I would set new goals for myself (like school, work, gym). Find someone you trust and talk to them about your problems. Like for me, it was my mother. Work on IMPROVING your health. Eat healthy, get enough sleep, get a good amount of exercise each week, and take a supplement. And most of all remind yourself this is a mental thing when you start to worry and IMMEDIATELY distract yourself. Please keep in mind this is a process, it didn’t get this bad over night so it will not be fixed over night, it will take time. Be patient with yourself. Talk to a counselor if you need to. \n🛑STOP POSTING QUESTIONS LOOKING FOR ANSWERS! 🛑 because you won’t find them here, unless your looking for ways to over come anxiety. \n\nIf you believe in God, pray often. If you need medication, take it.\n\nPersonally I never wanted meds because I don’t want to be dependent on them. But if it helps you, take it. If you need a break from work. Take it. Put you first. \n\nIf your scared to see a doctor make the appointment and MAKE yourself go for reassurance. Remember, if (god forbid) something is wrong, It’s better to find out  and take care of it then ignore it and it get worse (like, high blood pressure for instance, if you don’t take meds it can potentially eventually damage arteries) but it’s better to fix the problem and move on then to not do anything at all. But no matter what Google is not the answer. \n\nIf anyone needs to talk or has questions feel free to ask me! I am pretty educated in the health field as I’ve done many years of research as well as school\nFor registered nursing. I have family in the medical field, so if you feel you need to confide in someone don’t hesitate to DM me and we can work though this together, I don’t want to see anyone waste years of their life like I did if I can help it!\n\nXoxo❤️",

These are my symptoms (from head to toe): \n\n- Brain fog\n- Visual disturbances (floaters/fuzz/flashing lights) \n- Paresthesia (tingling or numb limbs) \n- Feeling off-balance (like I’m walking on a boat) \n- Ringing in my ears \n- & CONSTANT ANXIETY (YAY!) \n\nThis has all culminated in a health anxiety obsession. I thought I had a variety of illness from MS (I swear everyone here diagnoses themselves with this) to brain cancer, to whatever and had every test under the sun. EKG, Blood Tests, Brain MRI, Spine MRI, EMG, Nerve Conduction Tests and today, an Eye Exam…\n\nThe kicker… EVERYTHING CAME BACK HEALTHY. even the eye doctor today was saying I had some of the healthiest eyes she’s seen. ugh. I just want these symptoms to stop. I workout daily, take care of myself, and trying to enjoy life; but it keeps on happening. \n\nIf anyone has any advice or knows of any anxiety meds that help them through this, please let me know. I’m thinking of starting therapy soon. Being worried and hyper aware of your body daily is just torture. What’s funny is that I always feel fine whenever I’m drunk or hanging out with friends. lol.",

    "selftext": "Like many on here I have been utterly convinced that death was rapping on my door ready to whisk my into that gentle night and every time I go to answer it's just another version of myself standing dumbly at the other side of the door wearing a hood and cloak. \n\nI have had every symptom under the sun and yet despite what Dr. Google tells me I am still in near perfect health. What is the biggest and realest detriment to my health? Anxiety. It plagues my mind and has me pissing every 5 minutes in the night thinking I have diabetes or kidney failure (I'm actually just so dehydrated from fear that I gulp buckets of water every night). \n\nHell, just a moment ago I had somehow convinced myself that I have skin cancer because my hand was itchy. Why was it itchy? Because every damn time I take a piss from the waterfall I consume I wash and scrub my hands. Now I am no longer itchy because I chilled out some and used logic to slay that fear. \n\nI have a fluttering on the left side of my body, has to be some wicked mediaeval disease that wants to make me its playground, right? No, it's just the tummy rumbles that only ever appear when I am anxious.\n\nWait, do I have more moles than before? Yeah, must be dying... any day now... just waiting for that cancer... y'know, just wake me up when it starts to get interesting. \n\nAh, but this persistent uncomfortable leg feeling is deep vein thrombosis. But of course! I sit too much. So when will it shoot up and annihilate my brain? Probably fucking never actually. \n\nI am very much alive. Very much in good health, and besides a very overactive imagination and a love for horror, I am just another normal human being who occasionally finds themself short of breath - amongst millions of others - doing normal human things. \n\nWhat I have come to learn is that these symptoms aren't ones of imminent death but rather ones of life.\n\nFeel your heart beating weirdly? Guess what! Your heart is beating, it changing its pace or pattern is just what it does. Stop judging it so hard, man. Is your arm numb? Well shit, it might just be a normal human arm - sorry for the prognosis (in case you were hoping that you were another species).\n\nIf you feel anything at all it is a symptom of life. \n\nIf it's uncomfortable then perhaps you shouldn't drink 3 cups of coffee tomorrow aye? Or maybe your bedtime was basically yesterday. \n\nYou don't need reassurance, you need the sort of logic that experience gives you. If you've survived 5 false signs already then the 6th one is very likely to be nothing.\n\n\"But the boy who cried wolf was right eventually!\" Yeah, but you're on wolf watch in the fuckin' city and you're not just crying \"wolf\" but also \"lion\" and \"'gator\" at the slightest flashes of yellow and green. It's just a traffic light, go back to bed, chill out. \n\nYou haven't died since you began reading all of this have you? (Maybe a few braincells but that's just the Gilsworth charm).\n\nSo I'm here to remind you that you are okay, you're good, you're golden - and even if you weren't then the fact of the matter is that we live in an unprecedented time of medical wonder. \n\nYou are here because you know you worry, not because you know you have cancer.\n\nIz all gud, capiche?",

I’ve been so scared that Covid mixed with my “HIV”, “lung cancer”, “diabetes” etc would at least put me in the hospital. \n\nThen a month ago I woke up and drank some coffee that to my surprise tasted like water. Concerned and slightly amused I went through my refrigerator and starting trying to taste the most potent things I could find and my taste buds had absolutely no reaction. \n\nI start raising the alarm a bit by contacting people I’ve been around and reaching out to my mom. I got gaslighted by everyone. A familiar feeling for those of us who often “cry wolf” about health issues. But this time was different because I wasn’t even freaking out about it. I felt in good health besides not being able to taste or smell. Despite everyone telling me it was just allergies I scheduled a test. \n\nTwo days later and still no taste buds my diagnosis is confirmed, I got Covid. This is the first time my health suspicions are correct so instead of feeling relief I don’t have an illness I’m oddly relieved that I was right. I felt vindicated that I was able to accurately assess myself for once and on top of that I didn’t panic! \n\nMy doctor checked in with me every other day and they told me it was clear I had a really mild case. My taste came back after a week and I was released from quarantine after ten days. Everyone I had been around for the past two weeks got tested ( about 10 people) and no one else was infected. \n\nReflecting on my experience with Covid I’ve realized my health anxiety has been greatly reduced. I got covid and didn’t end up in the hospital! Therefore it’s even more unlikely that I have an unknown autoimmune disease or cancer! Who really knows if there’s a correlation, but for now I’m doing so much better and it’s all thanks to covid!\n\nStatistics can either be scary or helpful so I won’t list any here. I do want to remind all of you that severe cases are getting rarer and that the majority of those with covid have a mild infection. We will get through this, you’re healthier than you think! Lots of love!\n\nDisclaimer: I don’t consider myself to be very healthy in my daily life. My BMI is overweight bordering on obese so I technically am at a higher risk. I am incredibly lucky to have not given it to any friends or family. I was not safe and had gone away on a weekend trip for my birthday, which is where I assume I got it. I am completely responsible for getting Covid. This would be a very different story if I had given it to anyone else.",

Today I saw my doctor regarding that lymph node/lump on the right of my neck near my manidible but a little further that I posted about and she said honestly it feels normal and there’s no point in testing it or anything unless it were to get bigger. \nI had my father feel it and he claims i’ve had this thing since I was a kid and idk if he’s just saying that to ease my concerns but there’s that as well.\n\nBottom line is, I’ve convinced myself that I had Testicular Cancer, Meningitis, Colon Cancer, Skin Cancer for almost a year now and I just want to be through with it.

    "selftext": "Firstly, I want to thank everyone who has been a part of this community.  We are a unique group of individuals.  I remember when I first came here 4 years ago and having this door open where it was like \"I'm not alone!\".\n\nThis is a long one, so get ready.\n\nThat being said,  we as mods need to do better at curating this sub for the health of the community and its users.  What does that mean exactly? Well, we are going to realign this sub and focus on what Health Anxiety is, which is a mental illness. **The goal of coming to this subreddit should be getting proper mental help.** This sub will no longer be a place for people to come and constantly seek assurance. Moving forward it will be focused on helping individuals who are getting treatment or seeking treatment for this mental illness.  We refuse to enable reassurance seeking. In the coming weeks we are going to setup a more rigorous Auto-Mod feature that will crack down on posts that go against our rules.\n\nSpeaking of rules, we will be updating them to be more clear on what is and isn't going to be removed going forward. Specifically the most drastic change will be revolving around what we will consider \"***asking for a diagnosis***\".  Moving forward, **any posts listing symptoms, results, or having any questions about \"what this could be\" will be removed.** For the love of god, we **ARE NOT** doctors, 99% of the people who visit, comment, or post **ARE NOT** doctors. If you are a doctor, please do us a favor, and don't try and offer diagnoses.  **IF** you truly think something is wrong, you need to see a doctor, don't ask random strangers on the internet if we think you have something. To help everyone understand I will provide some examples:\n\n**WHAT NOT TO SAY:** \n\n* \"I have been having terrible chest pains for the last week. I'm a 22 M 189 pounds. I got my blood work done and there were some elevations regarding my WBC by 1.2 what does this mean?\"  \n* \"I have a strange lump under my armpit its 2mm and slightly movable, its been there for a month and I have lost some weight, I'm positive I have x cancer.\"\n* \"I've been doing research regarding X and I have a, b, and c symptoms, does this mean I have x?\"\n\n**WHAT YOU CAN SAY:**\n\n* \"I am struggling with heart related fears, its consuming my thoughts and it is getting difficult to focus on other things.\"\n* \"I'm convinced I have X cancer and I can't stop checking for symptoms, what I can I do to break this cycle?\"\n* \"I can't stop using google to look up random symptoms and freaking out about things, I could really use support.\"\n* Or simply \"I'm struggling hard right now, I could use some help/support.\"\n\nIts pretty straight forward, don't talk about symptoms or signs, focus on how HA is affecting your life. You are more than welcome to share your fears, but we don't need to hear about your symptoms or your self diagnosis.  **This is a support group for overcoming a diagnosed mental illness we can't diagnose you!** If we notice a pattern, we will give you a timeout.\n\n**The Other Newer Rules:**\n\n* Certain \"buzz illnesses\" will be automatically removed. AKA stop asking or freaking out about the Coronavirus.  We will NOT allow media-hyped illness to overrun or dominate the sub.  Please use the corresponding megathread.\n\n* Under NO circumstance will we allow any negative talks about doctors or medications. This isn't the place, and it only hurts the people coming here for support. If you don't believe your doctor that's a significant sign that you need medical intervention regarding your mental illness.\n* Do not solicit or give advice on medication dosages or stopping medications those will be removed. That is a question for a trained medical professional. \n* No one, and I mean no one wants to watch your video on how you started meditating facing the sun, doing naked yoga, and running barefoot over legos to \"cure\" you anxiety.  We will remove any posts to YT channels and perma ban you.  This is a support group, not an advertising platform for you to push traffic to get ad money.\n* Try to be as vague as possible about NSFW fears, we don't want to hear about your junk, sex life, or masturbation habits. They will be removed, and repeat offenders will be banned.\n* This isn't new, but I will restate it because its important: **ANY POSTS THREATENING, ALLUDING, OR SUGGESTING SUICIDE WILL BE REMOVED.**  No one here is equipped to handle these conversations, there are plenty of resources where you can speak to trained individuals.  Please don't put the weight of that on the people coming here looking for support themselves.\n\nThis is the start of the framework of taking the sub back, and moving towards helping people get the right kind of help.  Feel free to message us, or drop a comment with your thoughts.  Also I would like to plug the discord [https://discord.gg/pQ2dHnU](https://discord.gg/pQ2dHnU). It is pretty active and we are always looking for people to join our support staff.",

I had one of those scares a few years ago and I promised myself to never get in a position like that again. \n\nWell then 5 weeks ago I had this encounter with a guy where I was the receptive partner. We used condoms so I was not worried at all.\n\n Then EXACTLY 4 weeks after, I get flu-like symptoms. I started to freak out. I knew acute HIV symptoms occurred 4-5 weeks after the posible infection so I said to myself how can this be a coincidence? I had swollen lymph nodes, fever, chills, night sweats, sore throat, fatigue, even a canker sore, etc. I had everything. I connected the dots and all fitted. I did have bleeding gums so I thought it was maybe that and got it through oral. \n\nThen it crossed my mind that he tricked me and used a non-latex condom. Or that maybe the condom had a small tear. I thought of all the possibilities imaginable. I even thought he was homophobic and liked to infect other people. My mind was so fucked up. I went to the doctor and she said I had the flu. I got really scared, even more when I read the printed diagnosis and it said \"Flu due to unknown virus\". I was so sure that virus was HIV and that I just had flu-like symptoms, specially because I didn't spread the flu to anyone in my house, and I had read that the flu-like symptoms you get from HIV are not contagious. I remember telling her that I wanted to get checked for HIV and the look on her face was, for me, that she had figured it out and that now my symptoms made sense and it was HIV. She then said that HIV people live normal lives and it's not a death sentence anymore, and my mind said \"she's saying that to make me feel better because she now thinks its 100% HIV but doesn't want to tell me\" \n\n So I recover from the flu but then my throat starts to hurt, a sharp pain in my left tonsil, swollen uvula, redness in the back of my throat, etc. My immune system was weak (due to HIV) so probably I catched something, I thought. My body was seroconverting and I had every cell fighting the virus so an opportunist illness took advantage and I got sick again, the day after recovering from the supposedly flu-like symptoms I had. It got to a point where I said to myself that I had to accept I was carrying the virus and deal with it (a fake bravery I summoned don't know from where). Started thinking who am I gonna tell and treatment options. I felt so different. I have HIV now. This is now my life.\n\nFinally I got tested today at the 5th week mark and I took a big nap to wait for the result because I couldn't handle it anymore. Checked my email and it was a negative result. I felt so relieved. I had a 4th generation test done so its pretty much conclusive but I'm still taking it again at the 3 months mark just to make sure, even though I know the result is unlikely to change. I will update this and post my result when that time comes.\n\nSo please, don't freak out with HIV acute symptoms. Don't google symptoms. Just get tested. I think I looked up through every forum in the internet reading HIV stories and how they experienced exactly the symptoms I had and it only made it worse. The mind is so powerful and when we are in a vulnerable position everything you throw at it spreads like fire, feeding it with negative thoughts. The brain likes to look for ways to please its own way of thinking and make it look rational now matter how irrational they might be. So please avoid looking up symptoms, stories, etc. I was so certain I was carrying the virus because the coincidences were too much, and I still got a negative result. IM NEVER googling symptoms for anything again. It only makes you feel worse.\n\n I've always been a little hypochondriac. When I was younger I thought about cancer all the time. As I grew up I was sure I had some kind of heart problem and started getting panic attacks because of it. I was still young and did not know those were panic attacks so I thought I was having heart attacks. Now my fear is HIV, but I'm not fueling my anxiety anymore by googling shit. I'm still a bit insecure because I'm waiting for the 3 months mark but I'm not going into a quest for searching the accuracy of tests at x-week or things like that for hours on end. All I know is that my result is unlikely to change, and I won't feed my fear and anxiety by scrolling through endless websites and fucking my mind up. \n\nI hope this helps ease the mind of anyone going through the same, and I encourage everyone to leave behind everything they might have read on the internet about HIV acute symptoms, or any symptoms of any illness, please! Take care of your mind and don't feed it with the crap that's on the internet, specially when you are so vulnerable! This was eye opening for me. Your brain will only look for a way to justify your irrational thinking and only you are responsible for giving your brain more information to back up those thinkings!",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone! I’m having major heart anxiety right now lol but I feel like I great way to get my mind off of it is to share with you guys some great ways to help soothe your health anxiety! :)\n\n1. Recognize what is bothering you, and say out loud, “my anxiety is making me feel ___” (fill in ____ with what you’re feeling). It’s important to not push away your feelings and face them! \n2. Stop googling. This is an obvious one, but speaking from personal experience, it’s really hard to quit looking up symptoms when it’s on your mind 24/7. 99.99999% of the time, google. Is. Wrong. I have gone to the doctor for so many different symptoms, and every single time it was never what google scared me into believing. \n3. Get up and walk around. When we have anxiety, we increase adrenaline levels. Sitting around and letting our mind think crazy thoughts is only going to contribute to more adrenaline and fear. So, a great way to release that energy is to move around! Even if that means going outside for a few minutes! \n4. Meditate. Allow your body to relax for just a few minutes, and do some stretching. \n5. Exercise! Exercising is a GREAT way to release all that energy from your anxiety, AND contribute to an even healthier version of yourself! It’s a win win. Also, I have felt that sometimes I become very aware of my breathing when I workout which can make my anxiety worse, but you need to keep in mind that exercising is beneficial to any form of symptom. Working out is ONLY beneficial, and if you don’t feel comfortable doing a full exercise routine yet, pace yourself and take your time. There’s no rush!\n\nI hope this helps some of you!",

    "selftext": "TRIGGER Warning: I talk about death/dying. Also please note that this may not be everyone's path, but this has been mine and I wanted to share. \n\n\\----\n\nMy health anxiety is really a fear of death. \n\nOne of the things I’ve always struggled with is acceptance. Accepting the inevitable. \n\nFor months I was one hundred percent CONVINCED that I had multiple chronic illnesses despite all testing saying otherwise. \n\nI knew at a rational level that I was being illogical. But my subconscious was TERRIFIED. In the depths of my mind far underneath the surface, I *believed* that I was dying. I believed my body had failed me. I believed that I had lost control and that the outcome would be an irreversible swift and terrible death via cancer, disease, etc. \n\nThese beliefs manifested real physical symptoms. \n\nMy nervous system became confused - constantly firing off, leading to random full body twitching. My blood vessels expanded, leading to yellow and blue bruising and small pink dots covering my body. I broke out in rashes and my jaw popped from clenching my teeth through the night. \n\nI didn’t even realize I walked around with my shoulders up to my ears, always holding my breath, restricting my breathing and precious air flow to the rest of my organs which of course led to shortness of breath and chest/muscle pain.\n\nOne day when walking around in nature, I realized something - I looked all around me and truly saw the beauty of my environment. A breeze blew and my nostrils were full of the smell of freshly mowed summer grass and nearby flowers. \n\nI thought to myself “I am a part of *this*.” “This” being a world that is built of organic, natural, beautiful matter. All the things around me as well as myself would eventually break down in a never ending cycle of growth and decline. \n\nGrowth and decline. Growth and decline. Growth and decline. \n\nI realized that there was no use in fighting it. The flowers do not fight their decline. They simply move into the next phase of existence. \n\nI realized that the sooner I can accept this, the happier I could be in life. \n\nBy all means, get all the tests, explore sickness and illness and if there’s a real fight to be had, then by God, fight it. \n\nBut if you are simply afraid of natural decline, I welcome you to join me in surrendering control of the things that we cannot change. \n\nI would like to add that my 'realization' was a turning point for me, but it only came after MONTHS of putting in the work of getting treated for my anxiety and panic disorder. \n\nAs someone that has been diagnosed by a psychiatrist with obsessive compulsive tendencies (also GAD and Panic Disorder), I personally know how hard it is to just 'change your thought process' or 'turn off' your anxiety. \n\nI had to be put on high doses of anti anxiety medications and panic disorder medications to calm my central nervous system down before I could even begin to explore any sort of concept of surrender and acceptance or do anything else really. I am now weaning myself off all medications in favor of natural coping mechanisms. \n\nI also had to give things up (alcohol) and add things into my daily routines (exercise, yoga, journaling, meditation). It's freaking hard work. It requires intentionality and deep focus. \n\nBut trust me when I say that with hard work, determination, and commitment, I think that it is possible for you to better manage your health anxiety. Please don't give up. Sending hope to all of you.",

For every, if not all conditions there are plenty of non-fatal issues that can be, especially on an individual level and what you have been exposed to. \n\nOver the past 2 months I was completely stuck in the “what if” depression cycle and pretty much spent entire days googling symptoms.

    "selftext": "1. Pain, by itself, doesn't mean anything.\n\nLike, yes, you'll see pain listed as a symptom of a lot of cancers, but that's because it's a symptom of like, most things. Cancer typically causes a lot of other symptoms, and usually pain isn't the first one either. If you're like me and you have stomach pain or back pain and no other issues, the chances of cancer causing it are astronomical. You would be having other problems, especially if the pain has been ongoing for a while.\n\n2. Anxiety and generic cancer symptoms have a really annoying amount of overlap.\n\nEspecially \"unexplained weight loss\" and \"loss of appetite\", which are like the most common cancer symptoms across most cancers. Anxiety, especially severe anxiety, can easily cause those exact problems. Case study: me. I could barely eat for two weeks and lost 10 pounds, because I was anxious about cancer, which obviously just made me more anxious. When I finally started to feel better my appetite came back and I've already gained back most of the weight. The pain that made me anxious to begin with is still present but I'm eating fine and generally feel much less ill.\n\nI've certainly not cracked the secret to health anxiety yet; honestly I'm posting this because I'm spiraling a bit right now and I need to reassure myself.

    "title": "A reminder that statistics are tricky.",
    "selftext": "This is for you if you've read at some point something like \"X risk factor makes you 20% more likely to get Y illness\". You've probably seen something like that and panicked because X risk factor is something you can't change, and now you're doomed to get Y illness because of it. What you need to remember is that numbers are tricky, and that even when the numbers look bad it means less than you think.\n\nLet's do some examples. These are all made up so they won't spike anyone's anxiety.\n\nEx 1: \"Being female gives you a 20% higher chance of getting Exploding Bones Disease (EBD).\"\n\nThis is probably the most common kind, you'll see a lot of 10-50% chance increases. 20% sounds pretty significant, right? Well, how many people in this example get EBD? Even if it was an *extremely* common illness- let's say 10% of the population gets it- 20% would only add 2% to that. How different does a 12% likelihood feel vs 10%? Barely different, right?\n\nThe difference is even lower with less common illnesses. Say an illness has a 1% chance of occurring: a 20% increase = a 1.2% chance. Practically no increase on an individual level.\n\nEx 2: \"Drinking one soda a week gives you a 100% increase in incidence of Popping Teeth Syndrome (PTS).\"\n\nOkay, a much higher number now. This also applies to \"twofold increase\" or even \"threefold increase\". \n\nAgain, how common is PTS in this example? Assuming it's not extremely common, a twofold increase is not a lot. 1% -> 2%. 0.2% -> 0.4%. Basically barely an increase. Yes, if something is already very common a twofold increase is pretty significant; a boost from 20% to 40% is pretty major for example. But the vast, vast majority of illnesses (including the ones you're worried about, almost certainly) are not nearly that common. Hell, outside of the common cold I don't know that anything's so common as a 20% incidence.\n\nSo why are these stats important if they're such minor increases? Because they're applied to populations, not individuals. For example: let's go back to EBD (a very fake disease, if that wasn't clear). Let's say it has a 1% incidence rate and a 20% increased chance of occurring in women. Let's also look at the population of the US. The adult population is about 250 million. So for any one woman in the US their likelihood of getting EBD is 1.2%. Barely an increase at all. But over the population of the whole country (assuming a 50/50 split of men and women, I know that isn't exactly accurate), look:\n\n1% of men have EBD: 1,250,000 cases\n\n1.2% of women have EBD: 1,500,000 cases\n\nThat's 250,000 extra cases among women vs. men per year. That's very significant if you're a scientist and you're studying this, and definitely a thing for doctors and other professionals to consider. However, as an individual, *this does not matter to you*. For you, personally, the chance is 1.2%. Or, put another way, your chances of not having the illness are 98.8%. \n\n\nTL;DR: The stats are never as grim as they might seem. While risk factors may increase the possibility for an illness, for any individual person the risk of getting that disorder is almost always very low. Stats are there to show overall trends that are significant for scientific research. They are not there for you to give yourselves panic attacks.",

It may be muscular more likely because your young. The body isn’t just organs and blood. It’s in an impossibly complex array of muscle fibers, nerve channels, and bones. Sometimes our musculoskeletal system aches and hurts and we don’t know why. We quickly attribute it to cancer or something horrible like a heart issue, whatever. I’ve been battling this for 3 years. Over the last 3 years I have thought I was dying several times per day, each day, for over 1000 days and let it consume my life. I was wrong every single time.

For the past few months, it's been the fear of breast cancer for me (21 years old and male, go do the math on that one), despite numerous tests and reassurances from doctors.   \n\n\nBut, there was something I've always noticed when browsing this sub, and I'm pretty sure a lot of you have had the same experience. I'd scroll down the sub, looking for people with similar fears, and similar symptoms, hoping to find someone who can provide some form of reassurance. However, as I'd scroll, I'd see other people having their own issues, either related, or not related to my own.  \n\n\nAnd I'd always have the same exact thought when looking at them: \"Oh, they can't POSSIBLY be sick, I'M the one with the illness!!\" Or \"Their anxiety is just causing their symptoms, but my symptoms are real!\"  \n\n\nAnd I'm pretty sure a lot of you had thought the same exact thing. We always think we're the exception, the .0000001%, the unlucky ones.   \n\n\nBut, I want you to ask yourself something: Why? Why do you think like that? Why are YOU the medical anomaly? I asked myself the same question, and genuinely, I couldn't come up with a decent answer.   \n\n\nBut that's what Health Anxiety does, it isolates you, it makes you feel as if you're alone, when you're not. Because, chances are, about a million people out there are also worried about the same symptoms you are, and how many of those people do you GENUINELY think are really sick?   \n\n\nSo, again, ask yourself: Why do you think you're the exception? Why are YOU somehow the unluckiest person in the world, that you have EVERY illness known to man?",

    "selftext": "This sub has helped me through a lot of health concerns, but today I'm finally in a place where I can deal with it on my own so I'm posting to hopefully help someone else.\n\nI started off as a mess and eventually got a full heart/body checkup including an MRI and wore a heart monitor for 24-hours to check out my palpitations. After being told that everything is fine that was a big step. Getting a professional, comprehensive medical diagnosis to rule out what you're worried about goes a long way. After chest pains, numbness, tingling in my limbs, dizzy spells, being sent to the ER because urgent care thinks I might be having a stroke, and a ton of other shit, something outside my control changed: my stress level. I took on a different role at work that is much less stressful. I had no idea how big of an impact this was because I didn't consider myself \"stressed\" but several symptoms subsided with this change like everything digestive and the chest pain is less frequent. After I was told the chest pains are costochondritis (inflammation of the rib tissues, read: stress-induced) I saw a chiropractor for about 5 months who taught me some stretches and self-adjustments I could do with a back roller and now I've trained myself not to panic when I feel those chest pains. Just do the stretches and trust that I'm fine and sure enough, I am. Also, my doctor told me to cut caffeine and I didn't listen. I am a coffee junkie and cut back, but didn't cut it out entirely. Well recently I switched to decaf (I know, stick with me) and it's been life-changing. Yes, this is obvious. Yes, we all know caffeine raises your physiological arousal level. But many of us keep consuming caffeine not realizing just *how* much it actually contributes to the cycle. I'm a much happier person on decaf and I don't think I'll go back. I found out all of the shit I was dealing with can be caused by anxiety. So this whole time, it was the fear of a health problem that was causing health problems. Stress impacts us more than we realize!\n\nSo to recap, here are the things my dumb ass put off doing forever that really made a huge impact:\n\n-Get a doctor's opinion. As in, a thorough one if possible instead of just a quick visit. They will run some tests and give you a professional take on it. When you get this - TRUST IT. If you have reason to believe the doctor missed something, get a second opinion but really you should trust the doctor.\n\n-Manage your external stress. This doesn't mean quit your job, but if something is stressing you out (a situation at work, a significant other, family) take some real steps to get out of that situation! In my case it was a lateral transfer and a change in responsibilities but man did it lower my stress levels.\n\n-Cut the caffeine and any other stimulants including recreational ones. If you struggle with anxiety, your brain is already pumping you full of stress hormones in a fight-or-flight response. You absolutely do not want to make it worse. Even a little can impact some people (like me, apparently).\n\n-For the love of Reddit, never Google your symptoms.\n\nThe terrible thing about anxiety is once it has you, it's a downward spiral. But the inverse is true too. Once you are confident in your situation and know the quirks of your own body, you can come out of it quickly too. Hope this helps someone.",

I sat for 15 minutes after and then left for sonic\n\nI ate sonic and was clearly not used to eating shitty food bc of my diet and it made my stomach hurt really bad (which freaked me out because of my fear of vomiting) but proceeded to my moms house anyway\n\naround 5 pm, I noticed a headache I couldn’t shake. it wasn’t bad just prominent. the guy administering my vaccine told me to try to hold off taking pain reliever so I didn’t take anything \n\nbetween 7-9 I still had a stomach ache and some diarrhea (sorry TMI) and still had a headache. i’m trying to drink gatorade and water! \n\nI went to bed at 11:30 with no new side effects, just tired! \n\nmy cat woke me up at 2am (about 11 hours after my shot) and I noticed I was a bit achey but nothing crazy. still no fever, etc. headache still prominent. crazy hungry since I haven’t eaten!\n\nright now that’s where I am at!! I feel overall fine :) i’ll update when I get up for the day. \n\nI wanted to make this post because I’m so afraid of feeling bad and I contemplated this vaccine for so long. i’m not lying or exaggerating when I say that if I can get it, anyone can!\n\nupdate: I woke up around 10am, still achy but it’s ok!! I ate and took some advil and am just watching that’s so raven now 😂\n\nupdate again: \nI literally felt brand new within the blink of an eye! some point around 2:30 I felt like normal :) I did get a little tired and very very very very little bit of aches around 8:30 pm but I honestly popped an advil and feel completely normal. remember we all got this!\n\n*I should also say I do have arm pain, but for some reason that doesn’t make me anxious so I didn’t feel the need to mention it 😂",

    "title": "A new way to look at health anxiety",
    "selftext": "I wanted to share a different approach that helped me a lot in previous years and when I was at the peak of my health anxiety. My anxiety was always about my heart palpitations, is it ok, am I dying? To the point where I would over-analyse every.single.thing I felt. Every twitch, every weird sensation, every pain, every little thing that my body did basically. I went to counselling for it and there I learned a new way to look at it and I wanted to share it and maybe it will help someone else as well!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nImagine a machine that scans your body. It could be like a light scanner inside of you that just scans your whole body all the time. People with health anxiety, people like me, in stressful situations, turn this scanner ON, usually because their life feels so overwhelming that they just need something to control and they feel like if they can at least control their own body and make sure its always at 100% things will get better; That's how I felt at least.\n\nNow this scanner, once its ON it starts scanning. All. the. time. It scans from head to toe. It scans while you eat, while you drive, while you walk and it scans in the back of your mind; And then it happens:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou're walking down the street and you get a palpitation. You move your eyes too quickly and you feel dizzy for a moment. Your neck feels tight out of nowhere. A sharp sudden pain comes and goes in a moment out of nowhere. You name it - something small, something that passes in a second or two, something that this scanner is looking for;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd oh my god, does it send an alarm! Of course it does! The 'scanner' is literally waiting for something even remotely out of the ordinary, the tiniest of things to happen and it sends an alarm to the whole body. Suddenly you're in panic. What was that palpitation? Am I dying? Why am I dizzy, am I gonna faint? Etc. The panic passes and so does the symptom that \"caused it\" and now you're absolutely afraid of getting the same symptom again because you connect it to panic. And if you're like me - you connect it to the thing you were doing when it happened. In my case palpitations happened after I've eaten and it nearly created an eating disorder because I refused to eat anything more than a sandwich for months! I was afraid of eating because my brain was connecting the panic with food! I was afraid of food! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo moving on, panic is done, you're calm. But the scanner... The scanner has done a good job. In your brain, the scanner has done a fantastic job at alarming you that something happened! So it keeps going, in the background of your mind, looking, waiting for something even remotely out of the ordinary to happen... and sometimes, if a whole day passes and this scanner is going on in the background, you'll feel tense AF, almost like you've waited a whole day for something bad to happen to you. And that feeling alone can trigger symptoms so hey, more work for that damn scanner! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, every person has a scanner. However, in people with health anxiety that scanner is suuupeeer sensitive. An ordinary person's scanner would send an alarm when there's something genuinely wrong with you, something you need checked asap, but it wont send alarms for the day to day little things like heart skipping a single bit, small pain in your chest etc etc; \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo my way of dealing with it was once I realised that this was all that it was - I had a hyper sensitive health anxiety scanner in me haha! And its turned on most of the time, because of my health anxiety. So next time I get a weird sensation and my first thought is \"Shit im dying!\" I just follow it with \"nah, girl, thats the scanner's alarm\". And just recognising it as what it is - just a false alarm - helps calm me down and not go into full panic mode over something small. And remember, if it truly IS dangerous to you, the alarm will NOT STOP for hours, sometimes DAYS! And it will be more like \"Bring your attention to this symptom, its been happening in a while, it could mean something, you should  check it out\" and not \"OH MY GOD, THIS IS IT, IM DYING, THIS IS THE END, MY HEART IS FAILING, I CAN'T BREATHE\"; Learn to recognise the difference in your own body.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo yeah, that's it! It helped me cope and I hope it helps you as well :) Remember, a hyper sensitive scanner will slowly turn into sensitive scanner and at the end you'll be just like everyone around you with no health anxiety. Its just until then, remember that you'll be fine and your body can indeed send false alarms because you're fixated on your health so much, it thinks its necessary to let you know about ANYTHING and EVERYTHING that's happening inside of you. \n\nYour heart is just having a hiccup and like every other muscle in your body, sometimes it twitches for no reason! Your head is just a bit dizzy, but think of all the times that you've been so happy or so excited about something that you also felt dizzy and you were still completely fine! You got this!\n\nYou'll be okay! Keep going! <3 \n\nEdit: Thank you so much for the 2 Gold!!! I'm glad this post has helped people and calmed them down even a bit! 💗",

    "selftext": "For the past couple years my health anxiety was terrible. I would constantly think about my heart and other random shit about my body wondering if I was gonna die. It affected me everyday and there were many times when I was out doing something I had to physically leave because I was so anxious about my health.\n\nSince about a month ago my health anxiety is nonexistent. I beat it, and it feels amazing to have my life back.\n\nI recently found this sub and I empathize so much with the people here because I experienced the same things, I know how much it sucks. Hopefully this posts helps some people.\n\nPreface: I'm getting a lot of this information out of Napoleon Hill's *Think and Grow Rich.* He talks about what he calls \"The Fear of Ill Health\" and his knowledge of the subject cured all my anxiety.\n\n**I'm gonna summarize what's said in the book:**\n\n**The Mind**\n\nAs I'm sure most of you know Health Anxiety is all created in the mind. This means that the mind is the only thing that can cure health anxiety. Also understand your mind is extremely powerful and completely connected to your body in ways we can't explain. Your health anxiety has nothing to do with your body, and everything to do with your mind.\n\nYour mind and thoughts can affect your body in almost any way you let it. This is why health anxiety causes panic attacks and can even make you feel symptoms of the condition you're anxious about. Luckily we can control our mind and thoughts, therefore we can control and eliminate health anxiety.\n\n**The Fear of Ill Health**\n\nThe Fear of Ill Health is traced to physical and social heredity. It's closely tied to the Fear of Death (which I'll touch on) because it leads us into places we don't know but imagine to be terrible.\n\nIn main, we Fear Ill Health due to the terrible pictures that have been put into our minds if death should overtake us. This is the root cause of your health anxiety.\n\nHypochondria is the habit of thinking about an illness, concentrating the mind upon the disease, and expecting its appearance until a nervous condition appears. This is what your health anxiety is. \n\nIt's all created in your thoughts and mind! The mind is very powerful, it either builds or destroys us. Do not let your thoughts destroy you in the form of health anxiety.\n\n**The Fear of Death**\n\nFearing death is pointless. Death is inevitable for everyone. You must accept death as a necessity and pass it out your mind. It must be necessary or it would not come at all. And if it is necessary, which it is, perhaps it is not as bad as you may think.\n\nThe entire world is made of two things, MATTER and ENERGY. From elementary school we learn that neither matter nor energy (the only two realities known) can ever be created or destroyed. Both matter and energy can be transformed, but never destroyed.\n\nLife, if anything, is energy. If neither matter nor energy can be destroyed, then life can never truly be destroyed. Life, like many other forms of energy may passed through phases of transition and change, but never truly destroyed. Death is a mere transition.\n\nEven if death is *not* a mere change, at its worst it will be a long and peaceful sleep, and sleep is nothing to be feared. Thus, we can wipe out the fear of death forever.\n\n**How To Get Over Your Worry**\n\n*Relieve* yourself of the fear of death by accepting that death is an inescapable event. Accepting this is a big step to beating health anxiety.\n\n*Eliminate* the fear of ill health by **ignoring your symptoms.** Whenever you think you have a symptom just think to yourself \"I ignore my symptoms.\" No matter what it is, think \"I ignore my symptoms.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnderstanding the above information and thinking \"I ignore my symptoms\" whenever something comes up has given me my life back.

    "selftext": "Title pretty much sums it up.\n\nAfter reading some inspirational posts on here from people who conquered their battles with HA, I noticed one of the biggest things they said helped was to stop googling symptoms. So, I’m starting small. One week of no googling.\n\nI’ve already had the urge about 5 times since I woke up 3 hours ago, lol, but I’m fighting through it. I will be updating this post everyday to say whether I succeeded or not for that given day to keep myself honest. \n\nI would absolutely LOVE if people on this sub would join me in this “challenge”. If you feel comfortable joining and commenting below that you are doing so, that would be amazing! I think having a sense of community and camaraderie is extremely important.\n\nI hope this post isn’t breaking any rules! If so, I apologize and will edit accordingly.\n\nTUESDAY 1/8 UPDATE: Well, I made it the whole day! It was a STRUGGLE. I had the urge about 10+ times today, but I resisted. In part thanks to you all. I never expected this many people would join this with me, and I am so excited and grateful! We’ve got this!\nAlso, due to multiple great suggestions, I plan to create another post at the end of the week for an open discussion on how it went for everyone! Feel free to update on this one as well during the week if it helps you. I know updating this every day will help me. \nCongratulations everyone, day one complete!\n\nWEDNESDAY 1/9 UPDATE: Made it another day. Today was...hard. But, I fought through it. Focused on work, got more done than I have in a couple weeks, and went out for a relaxing dinner and drinks with my husband. Today was hard, I REALLY almost caved earlier. But I didn’t, and again I think I owe a good amount of that to all who joined me in this. It feels amazing to be a part of a “team” to fight this bullshit. I got some of my time back today.\n\nTHURSDAY 1/10 UPDATE: Made it another day!! Today was easier than yesterday. Focused a lot on work, then made a nice dinner when I got home. I had some physical symptoms/sensations, but I was able to ignore them long enough for them to move on. Today was a good day.\n\nFRIDAY 1/11 UPDATE: Sorry for the late update! Went out to the bar until the wee hours last night, lol. Yesterday was not as good as Friday. I made it the whole day, but I had to reallllyyy talk myself down in the late afternoon with a weird symptom I’ve been having. I just kept saying “I know this is weird, but you are not in immediate danger, and you are in no pain. Just move on, enjoy the rest of your night, and if this persists for weeks you can revisit it then”. And let me tell ya, it fucking worked! I totally forgot about it and had an amazing night. Thank you all for giving me strength this week. If I didn’t make this post, I guarantee I would have caved already. \n\nSATURDAY 1/12 UPDATE: Still going strong! “Strong” may be a bit of an over exaggeration lol, but I am going. Like I said in the last update, my anxiety about my health is still very much there, just instead of ruminating on it for hours through google it comes in fleeting spurts that are easy to move on from. I still of course think I’m dying though, lol. \n\nSUNDAY-MONDAY UPDATE: Sorry guys, I forgot to update these two days. Which is actually kind of a good thing, because I wasn’t thinking about my health to the point of forgetting to even do this! I just posted a follow-up post as discussed for everyone to talk about how the week went! ",

    "title": "For anyone freaking out about colon cancer, here are some foods that can cause the dreaded black specks in bowel movements",
    "selftext": "One of the typically recognized symptoms of colon cancer is \"black specks in stool\" because that's usually an indication of a bleed somewhere in the digestive tract, which isn't a good thing whether it's caused by cancer or something else.\n\n**BUT** there are lots of foods that can come out the other end of you that mimic this symptom. Some stuff will not digest all nice and neat and will exit your body having been exposed to digestion, but not necessarily getting fully digested, if that makes sense. \n\nI learned from a gastroenterologist that the process of digestion is what gives stool its color because normally it's more yellow due to bile, I think (sorry TMI), so it makes sense that undigested food exposed to the same process will darken in color too.\n\nThese foods include the following:\n\n* Fruits with itty bitty seeds (bananas, strawberries, raspberries, figs)\n\n* Fruits with dark skins (blueberries, blackberries, cherries, plums)\n\n* Flaky herbs (like parsley)\n\n* Nuts with skins still on them (peanuts, almonds, pecans). *Note: Skins on nuts are considered an insoluble fiber, which means they are not digestible, which is why they might show up in a bowel movement. Nuts themselves are a soluble fiber. I just learned this today.*\n\n* Beans with skins (kidney beans, black beans, red beans - I think these all contain insoluble fiber too)\n\n_______________________________________________________\n\nAlso, since black stools are another commonly reported symptom of colon cancer, here are some things you might consume that can bring on dark bowel movements too:\n\n* Pepto-Bismal, Maalox or Kaopectate (the active ingredient in these is bismuth subsalicylate, which can cause darkening of stools)\n\n* Too much dietary fiber (it's hard to even get enough fiber, let alone too much, so this one isn't as common)\n\n* Iron supplements or foods high in iron (which include many of the food items on either of these lists)\n\n* Food dyes/coloring (especially black, green or blue)\n\n* Red foods (tomatoes, red meat, red wine)\n\n* Black licorice or anything with activated charcoal in it\n\n* Naturally dark-colored foods (spinach, broccoli, beets,)\n\n_______________________________________________________\n\nA couple other things to keep in mind: just about every source I saw said that things you've eaten are the cause of a vast majority of instances of black specks in stool and/or discolored stool - like at least 90%. So if you just pooped and it looked like it was full of pepper, consider what you've eaten within the last 48 hours and if it's on this list. Odds are if you don't consume that food again for a couple days, these symptoms will clear up.\n\nAlso, remember that stools with blood in them smell FOUL. Anyone who has ever smelled an intestinal bleed will know it is a much different and much worse smell from a normal BM. \n\nObviously if you have these symptoms in conjunction with other strange new digestive issues that last 2-3 weeks without relief, it would likely warrant a doctor visit to rule out actual health issues. But if they go away with some temporary dietary changes, it's nothing to lose sleep over.",

    "selftext": "Sometimes I get a good day where I feel like I have a lot of clarity. I figure it's worth trying to share with others. Here are some reminders:\n\n* Even doctors have to go to doctors because self diagnosis is incredibly unreliable\n* The times that people have died from un-diagnosed \"silent\" conditions is far, far, far less than the amount of times that those conditions were present enough to cause concern in the patient, and get it fixed or treated. Our bodies are incredible alarm systems.\n* The symptoms of dehydration and lack of food are very very very real, and are often very similar to a lot of the scarier symptoms of more serious things. Think about it - even if you're a little hungry or dehydrated, your body is going to want you to know, it's going to cause non-dangerous symptoms. It really, really all could be just that - especially with how common dehydration is in the modern human.\n* EVERYTHING is a \"risk factor\". No, I promise I'm not saying this in a scary way. I'm saying that calling small things \"risk factors\" is sort of part of the fear-mongering that the internet does when it comes to health stuff. The term gets thrown around so easily about such small, normal things that it's basically not worth considering most of the time.\n* If you're anything like me then you probably live a very sedentary life - just remember that when you are sitting around doing nothing, your mind has all that free space to fill with health anxiety (and cause fake symptoms)\n* You can reliably assume that you are taking your symptoms too seriously and scaring yourself too much on a normal basis if you have gone to the length to be subscribed to this sub-reddit and be reading this post right now.\n* Everyone has weird symptoms. Everyone. All the time. Anything you can think of. My dad lived with chest pain for years and years when he was in his 20s, and he's now 61 and entirely healthy.\n* The average lifespan is the average for a reason. If you are under that age, especially if you are very young, the odds are intrinsically in your favor. Remember Occam's razor. Also, that age is continuing to go up :)",

I've been struggling with hypochondria and GAD for years but have had a particularly bad couple months recently.  Like so many of you, my anxiety produces so many random and unusual symptoms.  And every time I feel something new or unusual, I'm left compulsively reading every medical publication on what it could potentially mean and then relentlessly calling all my friends who are in the medical field, seeking reassurance that I am not on death's doorstep.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut then I stumbled upon this community\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReading all of your posts has truly helped me start challenging my oh-so-corrupted thought process.  You've helped me acknowledge just how complex a monster anxiety is and how many symptoms with supposedly nothing but ominous causes can indeed be attributed to anxiety. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut the most important posts in this entire subreddit are the ones talking about reassurance, and how it is comparable to a drug.  Nothing could be a more accurate description of how addicted and dependent I've become on hearing the words: \"Everything seems fine.\"  It seems to be a common theme among the success stories in this community that breaking ties with google and incessant doctor's appointments are the first steps to recovery.  Well, I'm happy to say that today I took that first step.  When I woke up this morning, I promised myself that every time I felt a pain or something unpleasant, and that massive urge to open up webMD started to come on, I was going to turn off my phone and walk away from it.  It was not easy, AT ALL.  Every minute that went by that I didn't do research, I felt like doom was closing in on me.  For hours the anxiety worsened until I was on the verge of having full blown panic attacks.....\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut  then..... things started slowing down.  I realized my original symptoms that were triggering me had subsided....and in time, my fight or flight response had mostly stood down.  As I'm typing this, I still am very much on edge and am still feeling that crippling impulse, and I know I still have a long road ahead of me, but this was a big victory for me.  A big first step.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you for taking the time to read.  I look forward to getting to know all of you and offering up what support I can.",

    "selftext": "Hello All! This post is long over due and a long one but the sun is shining out today, it is a beautiful day, and I feel like there’s not enough of these kind of posts on this subreddit so I thought I would like to share my story and maybe inspire and motivate others. Health anxiety has knocked me down more times then I can count (numerous panic attacks, fear of heart attacks, fear of ALS, fear of MS, fear of cancer) and I am so thankful for this group as I am not alone and I will continue to fight this type of anxiety day in and day out and I believe you guys can be able to fight it too as we are tougher and stronger then health anxiety. I can go ahead and tell my whole story from when all this first started (at 20 years old probably) but I will only tell my story from this past year:\n\nEver since July of 2019 I have been on edge as I believed I either had a brain tumour or MS. (My grandpa had MS so I was worrying that I might have gotten it) my symptoms started as: \n\n-Migraine with Aura  each episode lasting 30 mins and happening 5 times in the span of a week and a half (July-august) and this symptom hasn’t happened since but was still worrisome at the time!) \n-Bugs crawling on skin sensation (July-present)\n-Headaches (July, still get them from time to time)\n- right arm numbness (July-October on and off)\n- right leg numbness (September-Novemberish)\n-right pinky finger getting a cold sensation (October-present on and off) \n- sexual problems (this doesn’t happen all the time, but has been a problem every once in a while for past 3 years.. I have chalked it up to just being a nervous nelly and anxiety/stress)\n-frequent urination (have always kind of been one to go to the washroom quite a bit... I also drink lots of water though) \n-brain fog (July-present on and off)\n-body wide twitching (December 2018-present) \n- finger tremors (only really happens after a night of drinking)\n- left leg tremors (probably just normal) \n-double vision (august-present, I have been told I have astigmatism though) \n-ghosting ( most likely due to astigmatism)\n-seeing white/silver dots (this probably is the scariest now that I think about it cuz I dunno why I get them in my vision from time to time only last about half a second)\n-cob webs In vision (probably just from aging who knows)\n-left eye pain (July-November on and off, usually after lifting heavy weight in gym but I thought for months this was optic Neuritis, a prevalent Symptom of MS)\n-Scotomas in vision when looking at the sky (august-present, about the same time as the migraines started)\n-Dizzyness(august-December on and off)\n-The list goes on but you get the picture. \n\nThe above are majority of symptoms that fit the MS criteria. \n\n\nTo say the least, this past year has been a living hell for me and has turned a lot of good days into brutally awful days. I thought there was going to be no hope for me on numerous occasions, I thought the possibility of MS was going to be a real reality for me. That I would have to give up the career I was pursuing which requires me to be healthy and do something else with my life. The possibility of what will my significant other think, what if my quality of life is effected. Etc etc. So many of these thoughts inside my head consumed me day in and day out. After the migraine symptoms and losing my vision temporarily and having a numb right arm after I decided to take action:\n\n-Saw family doctor about issues late august\n-Saw family doctor two weeks later as symptoms weren’t getting better. Family doctor going to refer me to a neurologist\n-Late October get in to see neurologist. Neurologist refers me for MRI\n-Jan 13 MRI appointment \n-Jan 25 results are back but have to wait until feb 13 to see neurologist (I think this time period was the worst anxiety wise)\n-Feb 13 neurologist appointment.\n\n*FEB 13* The day has finally arrived. This is the day that is going to change my life forever. The day I receive my diagnosis of MS. I thought all was over. I sit down in my neurologists office, he starts talking as if he’s going to give me some bad news, and then he says “it appears there was no indication of demyelination diseases in your MRI scan (demyelination disease is MS) and it came back normal” I was so relieved I started crying in tears of joy as soon as I left the neurologists. I felt like I have just been rejuvenated, like I have been given a second chance. I felt so much weight slip off both of my shoulders and I immediately felt like the sky is still the limit for myself going forward. \n\nIt is still surreal to this day and I am so thankful. Without a doubt I know I will still be battling this terrible hypochondriasm going forward as I know for a fact that it is not that easy to just get over. I will be seeking therapy in the near future and doing everything I can to be the best version of myself day in and day out. I will keep fighting and I believe you guys will keep fighting as well and I am here for you. I just wanted to tell my story to maybe give hope to others and to show that many of my symptoms that I had were ALL caused by Anxiety and Stress and that the brain is a very powerful organ that is capable of causing symptoms like that. \n\nI made a post earlier leading up to the neurologist appointment and there were a few of you that wanted to know how it went so hopefully you come across this post. And Thank you to everyone who took the time to read this. It was a long one. Keep fighting the good fight, you are not alone.",

I do not know why I didn't think to find a subreddit for health anxiety until recently. (I usually just went on the diagnosing subreddits which made it worse).  After relapsing into panic attacks again over the last couple of days, I decided to go on Reddit to distract myself. After finding this community, I have felt so much better about my anxiety and knowing that there is a community of 42,000 people all willing to help each other beat their anxiety is so comforting to me. I read many of the posts and the reassurance and support from total strangers is another example of why the internet can be an amazing place.

A lot of us think \"Well, I have always been really healthy, but what if I'm actually not?\" Or we think \"I mostly take pretty good care of my health, but how much does that even matter?\" Our uncertainty-intolerant minds always go straight to the 1 in a million scenario, because that's what feeds into our fear, and we have learned to tend to our fear. Thinking \"Of course there's a one in a million chance I can have this rare blood disorder, but the odds of that are so much lower than any other thing that ever could have happened to me and didn't, so I'm not actually worried\" does not feed into our fear. It doesn't \"protect\" us in the way that we think we need protecting. \n\nWhen you get yourself worked up over the What ifs, think about all of the countless people before you who gave WAY less to their health-related fears than you do, and they still lived for a lot longer than you think you're going to live. Think about all those people who spent their whole lives thinking about what was actually happening rather than worrying about what might happen. Think about all of those people who really never did anything productive towards their health or did plenty of things that were bad for them. Think of all the people who lived in a time before modern medicine and before we really knew what was good or bad for us. Picasso lived until he was 91. Thomas Jefferson died at 83. Rosa Parks was 92. Eleanor of Aquitaine, who was alive in the MIDDLE AGES, died when she was 82. I know we tend to focus on those who died young, and those who die from crazy causes, but once in a while, focus on how amazing our ability to live long lives are and how amazing modern medicine is. We are strong and we are resilient. I'm guessing you have access to better health care than Eleanor of Aquitaine did. \n\nI'm sure your HA has argued this thought exercise every step of the way but just try to challenge it sometimes. What if you do live a long, healthy, happy life? What if you have minimal health problems before you die in your old age? What if you have SUCH a better chance than all those before you who died in their 80s or 90s after ignoring every lump, bump, and pain their whole lives? Just think about it :)",

    "selftext": "I think we all agree that we worry too much about \"what if\" and don't put enough stock into \"what is.\" Case in point, me right now- I started a few weeks ago with this feeling like I needed to pee all the time. Saw my doctor, he did a couple tests, nothing. This had happened a few months ago, same result. He said it was likely just a stress reaction or irritation from the balanitis I was diagnosed with a couple weeks prior, and there was nothing to be concerned about. It mostly went away for a week or so.   \n\n\nI had my annual physical 3 weeks ago and my doctor did a full workup- all the blood tests, urine tests, STD panel, the whole shebang. Nothing comes up aside from some elevated cholesterol, not a new concern. He does a physical examination as well and tells me \"you're a healthy person.\" Hearing that helped until it didn't.  \n\n\nFast forward a week- this weird urinary frequency is back, along with lower back and hip tightness and tenderness in the whole area. This includes the bladder, which freaks me out. I also get a recurring case of balanitis, doctor gives me a cream, it's clearing up. But then I had the thought \"What if this is a kidney infection or something?\" BAM, my mid back starts acting up. This ignores the fact that my reflux is back, likely because of stress and drinking coffee again (which I've stopped) and that I have no fever, fatigue, or any other signs of illness.   \n\n\nI hate this. Everything I've just described is something I've dealt with before and ended up being nothing remotely serious. Lower back, pelvic, and hip discomfort? Posture is bad and it's pulling my hips in a direction they shouldn't go. Mid back pain, reflux, and gas? I used to be on Nexium for this and when I slouch, that's right where I end up rounding my back. Urinary frequency? Went away quickly without any fuss. But now it's happening all at once and my mind is racing and I hate all of it. The worst part is that none of it is even all that bad and the pains seem to come and go. I'm living pretty normally and when I'm busy or my mind is occupied, I don't even notice a lot of this. But here I am, afraid I have a kidney or bladder problem when I have multiple explanations on why that isn't true.   \n\n\nI apologize for that leading nowhere, but I just needed to rant. I was doing pretty well until last month and now, in a few weeks, I feel like I've totally disintegrated.",

Sometimes I’m so jealous and mad at people who don’t have to experience this kind of anxiety day in and day out. Like it must be nice to not worry about imminent death or fatal diseases all the time 🙃🙃🙃 On a positive note, Prozac and therapy have changed my life and even though there’s no “cure” I highly suggest self care, cutting out googling symptoms and diseases, and exercise. I made this post mostly because I’m in the middle of a relapse and feeling pretty salty about it.",

    "title": "How I beat Hypochondria",
    "selftext": "**Note: There really is no \"beating hypochondria\" or \"beating anxiety\". It is a disorder and there are a lot of things you can do to learn to live with it and happily too.**\n\n*Backstory: I have had anxiety since I was in pre-school and didn't know it until I was an adult. My hands would feel like they were blowing up like a balloon and I couldn't breathe. When I entered my 20's it turned more into hypochondria. I did not know what was wrong with me and I just figured that I was strange. I didn't even know what anxiety really was. I thought it was just nervousness before an interview. I had a child in my early 20's and went through post partum depression, hypochondria, anxiety, depersonalization and derealization. I've had ER visits, more EKGs than I can count, a heart monitor and countless therapy sessions all pointing to good health.* \n\nThese are some tips I recommend, please feel free to comment if you need further clarification or if you have any addition questions! Feel free to add what has helped you as well!  :)\n\n**Age**  \nI feel like my anxiety was at its worst when I was in my 20's. The brain doesn't fully develop until age 25 so I feel there is a lot your body and brain are going through. You can't avoid age but maybe knowing that it's worse when you're younger can be comforting. I didn't start feeling like I was in control until my early 30's. \n\n**Knowledge**  \nI recommend NOT educating yourself with WebMD or other sources that are similar. The internet can be extremely helpful in many different ways but it can harm you too. When I had a heart palpitation or my arm felt weird or I had an icepick headache I would go straight to Google. A part of hypochondria is that helpless search to find out what is wrong. We are so in-tune with our bodies we want to know exactly what is wrong. Why did I just have that pain or twitch? So we Google it to hopefully find out something that will comfort us and we usually find something bad. Re-assuring yourself by checking your pulse is the same exact thing. Write down your symptoms in a journal or note app and come back to them later. Make it a goal to not Google or pulse check for that day. It's hard at first but try to write it down, take 10 **DEEP** breaths and engage yourself in a distracting activity.\n\n**Diet**  \nWhat you eat is VERY important with how your brain and body works. Here are some anxiety triggering foods: [https://www.eatthis.com/foods-make-anxiety-worse/](https://www.eatthis.com/foods-make-anxiety-worse/)\n\nCaffeine is a huge trigger for me. I learned that there are foods with natural caffeine in them that I must stay away from as well like chocolate and acaii berries. I went vegan (I do not recommend this for you but it is what I decided to do), which is not for everyone but if you cut out processed foods, sugars (not natural sugars like fruits) caffeine and alcohol it can have a great effect on your body and mind. (Taking vitamins that help with anxiety could help you as well - magnesium, B-12, Omega-3)\n\n**Health**  \nYou should get a yearly checkup of course, but if you go to the ER or clinic a few times a week there is a problem. At one point I had 6 EKGs in the span of 6 months (once a year is recommended) and I was checking my blood pressure at a public machine almost daily. I never had a bad EKG reading. Again, we go to the doctor for re-assurance when we actually should be more assuring with ourselves. If you have a cold, or you have a high fever, a cough or internal pain for days yes, go to the doctor. But you need to start remembering all of your previous symptoms. I cannot tell you how many times I have thought \"Okay, I have felt weird like this before, but THIS time is REALLY weird\" and I freak myself out and truly believe that THIS time is different than the other times I felt off. This is something you have to remember in your head. \"I have felt this way before or similar and I was fine\" \"This time may be different but I will get through it just like last time and the time before that\". This is where your journal will help, you can review all the times you were having anxiety about something and see all the attacks you survived.\n\n**Hormones**  \nThis section is really only for people who have menstrual cycles. Your hormones peak during ovulation as well as when you are on your cycle. I notice my anxiety is higher on ovulation days. Here is a guide: [https://www.myhormonology.com/how-do-your-hormones-affect-anxiety/](https://www.myhormonology.com/how-do-your-hormones-affect-anxiety/)\n\n**Constructive Worrying**  \nSwitch your worrying to constructive.  \n\"What if there's something wrong with my heart?\" - \"What if my heart is fine?\"  \n\"What if the doctor says I have a disease?\" - \"What if he tells me I am healthy?\"\n\n**Quick Fixes**  \nPhysical sensations are very hard to get through. You physically feel a palpitation, your heart racing, your head feels weird, you have a strong pinch in your arm. You actually feel them so they immediately put your brain in a bad mindset. Palpitations are not dangerous unless you are a newborn, elderly, or having them constantly throughout the day for several days. Whenever I have one I think about what I just did that could have caused it. I might be going through a stressful situation, thinking about a stressful thing, maybe I drank no water that day or maybe I just ate something with alcohol or caffeine. Exercise, not drinking enough water or being sick with a fever and cough can cause a palpitation too.\n\n* Think about what you just ate, thought about or physically did that could have cause a sensation\n* Drink a cold water\n* Alternate nostril breathing: Starts at 1:01 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uA05sgCeQ1E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uA05sgCeQ1E)\n* Play a puzzle game to get your brain thinking (CandyCrush, Haiku Games, Puzzles, Word Searches)\n* Talk with a friend or family member\n* Journal\n* Light exercise, yoga or meditation\n* Constructive Worrying\n* BAAR (Breathe, Accept, Acknowledge, Release) \\*This is something I made up while going through depersonalization. (Breathe in deep, accept the anxiety sensation or thought, acknowledge it happened, Release your breath and your thought\\*\n\nConclusion  \nYou have hypochondria which is an anxiety disorder and you can learn to live with it comfortably. You might even get to a point where it is laughable when you get a symptom. Remember your history of getting through all those times you thought you'd never get through it. Remember that it is the disorder that makes it hard for you. Acceptance really does help. I am in my 30's now and I do still have days that have anxiety but I remember how many years I suffered thinking and worrying this way and I take my breaths, maybe make some tea and move on. You are not alone, no matter how weird or foggy your brain makes you feel. \n\nYou have an amazing brain! You just need a little tweaking with your health anxiety but you'll get through it, just like you have before :)",

    "selftext": "(TW for mentioning specific diseases) \n\nHey, y'all. So, things are starting to flair up again, so I think just writing everything down will really help. \n\nI've *always* been anxious about my health. I had my first panic attack when I was 11, and the symptoms of it had me begging my mom to take me to the hospital for weeks after the fact. \n\nWell, I'd been managing it pretty well. Maybe an occasional superfluous trip to the doctor here and there, but nothing so major it fully impacted my day-to-day life. \n\n\nWell, the morning of March 18th, 2020, a few weeks before my 22nd birthday, I woke up, and yellow fluid ran out of my nose. It was neon yellow, nothing I'd ever seen before. I'd been an allergy sufferer my entire life, but this was new. This was *terrifying*. \n\nInstantly, I was a Google Dr., and I had a diagnosis: CSF Leak. My brain was leaking fluid. It all made *so* much sense! I had every symptom! I was dizzy, and my back hurt! That *had* to be the explanation! \n\nBy the time March 21st rolled around, I had seen 4 doctors, including an emergency room visit. I saw a different doctor everyday. They all told me the same thing: Allergies. You have a sinus infection. Take an anti-biotic. Obviously, they were wrong! I had a *life-threatening disease!* They just thought I was too anxious to take me seriously. \n\nOne, though, as he looked at my charts and saw this was my 4th trip in 4 days, looked at me and said, \"I'm writing you a referral to our neurology team. If your brain is leaking *anything*, they'll find it.\" Then, he told me what every HA sufferer dreads to hear, \"Also, I think it would help you to speak with a therapist.\" \n\nThat was it! He wrote it in my charts! The largest provider of Healthcare in my state *knew* I was crazy. They would *never* take me seriously again, and I was going to die. \n\nI went home. The Neurology appointment was two weeks away. COVID had shut my job down. So. What did I do? \n\nI slept. \n\nFor two weeks, if I wasn't asleep, I was begging my husband not to go to work. I was *begging* him to stay with me, in case I didn't wake up. After five days of this, his gentle, soothing demeanor waned. He would wake up and leave the room. Say nothing more to me than, \"Please eat something today.\" and \"You need a shower. Please try to take one today.\" or \"Have you checked on your Animal Crossing Island lately? Why don't you see how it's doing.\" He did what he could from arms length, but I wasn't the woman he married, and the start of the pandemic was *especially* brutal for him. \n\nThe Neurology appointment turned up clear. The doctor sent me along for an MRI, just to soothe my worries. The MRI date was 3 weeks away. \n\nBy this point, my symptoms had grown *much* worse. Turning my head too suddenly made me *extremely* dizzy. I'd be hit with sudden waves of nausea. My back and shoulders *ached*, and, most damning, an *excruciating* pressure headache that felt as if someone had wrapped a rubber band around the bridge of my nose. \n\nI was getting worse, and *every day*, I wanted to just ***die already***, just so I wouldn't have to *feel* this anymore. \n\nMy husband of *3 months* took care of me. I literally cannot overstate the difference this guy made. I'm sure, in January 2020, standing at the altar, he would have never imagined, just a few short months later, he'd be coming home from a soul crushing, impossibly difficult job, waking me up, and sitting with me to make sure I ate something that day.  I was a zombie. I completely withdrew from everyone. My own mom called me crazy. \n\nEvery time my husband pulled away from me, disengaged to take a break, I grew angry. *Resentful*. Couldn't he see? I was dying. I was **dying**, and he didn't care! He wasn't worried at *all*! \n\nI wanted to die. I wanted to die *so* badly. If I hadn't been so absolutely terrified of it, I would have done it myself. \n\nThe MRI came and went. My results? Clear. Totally, and completely clear. *Nothing*. There was ***nothing*** wrong with me. \n\nIf that was true, why was I feeling these things? I wasn't making them up!!! I could barely stand for longer than 30 minutes! I was *weak*, shakey, unable to communicate clearly. My sharp wit was dull and I couldn't perform the basic tasks! Surely, I was in cognitive decline. I needed more tests. I ***needed*** more. Just to be *sure*. They had ***missed*** something, and I was dying!\n\nWhen I brought this up to my husband, he took my hand, and said, \"Tomorrow's your birthday. Can we try celebrating?\" \n\n*I had forgotten about my own birthday.*\n\nAfter a day of slow-paced celebrating, I booked an appointment with a therapist. \n\nSlowly but surely, I got better. \n\nMy symptoms subsided. I was awake during the day, if only for a few hours. I started eating regular meals. I showered and brushed my teeth and just. Existed. I was a living human person again. \n\nInstead of immediately bombarding my husband with my anxiety, I *listened*. I listened to how hard work had been. How he had *also* started going to therapy. How had I *missed* that? \n\nI had lost 2 months of my life, and I was angry. I was *so* angry. So, I decided never again! I would do whatever I had to to make sure this *never* happened again. \n\nWhich brings us back to why I'm writing this. \n\nI've always had stress related heart palpitations. I've had my heart checked, and there's nothing wrong with it. Since they're such a regular occurrence for me, they're usually easy to ignore. Now, I gained 50 lbs over quarantine (when I got my appetite back, it was ravenous and unforgiving), so, my clothes are a little tight. \n\nThe combination of my usual heart palpitations and the squeeze of my old bra sent me spiraling into a heart-related panic attack. I spent all day yesterday in a dizzy, headachey, brain-foggy haze, ignoring everything I knew. \n\nYes, my heart palpitations get worse when I'm stressed. Yes, my brain has put me in an incredibly stressful situation, triggering heart palpitations. The HA monster that sits in all of our brains, though? *He* was *adamant* that I was experiencing a major heart attack and could die at any second. *Everything* came back, and, suddenly, I was begging my husband not to go to work again. \n\nYesterday, I was dizzy, weak, and afraid. \n\nThis morning, I got out of bed, and wrote this.  I do not care what it takes. I am *not* doing this again. \n\nSo, for those of you who made it this far, thank you. I promise you, there are people out there who know what you're going through, people who have *been* there, and *are* there. You aren't alone.\n\nOne day, you will wake up and see how far you've come. One day, you will wake up, and everything will feel like a distant nightmare. \n\n**Hold onto that feeling.** That triumph is what will push you through to the other side. \n\nYou're going to make it. You *will* be ok.\n\nThank you.",

    "title": "I want to give back by sharing my story.",
    "selftext": "I don't make my own reddit posts but I feel like I need to for other people.\n\nA little background: I'm a psychotherapist (weird, I know), who has a sad history of health anxiety, sometimes cancer but mostly devastating neurological diseases.\n\nWhen I was in graduate school, and I had very hard internship at a hospital. I remember my first (now looking back) panic symptom that was odd. My vision was blurry. Hm.\n\nAt my first therapy job I noticed eye pain as well. Now, looking back, I was very stressed and the florescent lighting is trash. But, I researched, and wouldn’t you know it? Eye pain is an MS symptom. I’m a white woman in my 20’s. Uh-oh, that’s the main demographic. I’m in trouble. I keep googling and as I see symptoms I start to get those symptoms. They don’t come and go, they are CONSTANT. My face on one side and my arm on one side are numb. All. The. Time. 4AM? Numb. I cry all the time, go to neurologists, have many tests, rack up bills. No MS. I see a psychiatrist, was prescribed Lexapro, and within a few weeks my life is back to normal. Shouldn’t say this was simple because I cried for months, and would vomit every morning out of sheer panic. But, it’s behind me. I take the meds for 3 years, then decide I can stop.\n\nI should note that in between this event and the next, I had smaller events and went to doctors for them, always was nothing. But, then..\n\nA year later something happens. One day I notice my hand feels weird. It’s like my typing is clumsy. I spend 4 hours on ALS forums reading people’s experiences. I watch youtube videos of diagnoses. Oh no. This is it. My muscles start twitching uncontrollably. I have cramps in my legs, in my hands, every day. I cry all the time. I plan my death. I tell my fiancé he should probably move on, that we shouldn’t have the wedding because the money would be better saved for care. I go to the doctor, he says I seem fine. He reads my medical records and sees I have health anxiety. Says I can see a neurologist if I want, but it’ll probably be a waste. Puts me back on Lexapro. My fiancé also insists that I start therapy. I believe it’s a waste because I’m dying, but fine.\n\nEvery morning I wake up nauseous, sobbing, hands cramped. I read and read and read. I see my hand is smaller on one side. I’m wasting away. I lose lots of weight, and can barely do any work. I see a neurologist, practically crawling to the office because I feel so weak. When she tests my reflexes, they are hyper. Another symptom. I immediately burst into tears. She tries to assure me that a lot of young people, and anxious people, have hyper reflexes, but I’m hearing none of it. We schedule an MRI and have a follow up in a month.\n\nThe weeks waiting for the medication to kick in are BRUTAL. **Everyone needs to know that SSRIs have bad side effects in the initial weeks, including increased anxiety** (I know, right?). You have to understand that it takes a long time to build in your system, you have to be patient. This is where the therapy comes in. We used CBT which really maps out your greatest fears, the likelihood of that outcome, and your ability to cope with that outcome. We look at the FACTS. I am not a doctor. This is incredibly rare. Surely I would’ve gotten worse by now. I don’t feel my hand is messed up when I’m drinking alcohol (**my favorite health anxiety hack**—drink and see if you still have the problem! lol). I start doing yoga in my office even though I suck at it, because I just want to feel better.\n\nSelf-talk is very dangerous. **You need to watch the messages you're playing in your head**. I told myself \"I know it. I know\" over and over again. It's like your own personal health anxiety flavored brain washing. I changed it to \"It feels like. It feels like\". And like my therapist said, **Feelings aren't Facts.** \n\nThe 24/7 panic stops, but I’m still worried. I follow up with my primary, he says I’ve gained some weight back and look a lot better. I see the neurologist again, and she notes the same. I was prepared mentally for this appointment with an agenda. I said,\n\n“I trust you. If you say I should get an EMG, I will. If you think I shouldn’t, I won’t”.\n\nShe said “consider this a clean bill of health. I don’t think you need an EMG”.\n\nI give her a hug, thank her for being so kind, and move on with my life. I am not allowed to google this anymore. Point blank period. I thanked my friends for dealing with me during this time, and now I just cope with some bummer side effects from the Lexapro, but I don’t care. I have my life back.\n\nMy therapy moved to twice a month, and I still take the medication. My muscles twitch sometimes and.. oh well! Not as much as before. More evidence that it was stress related. Logic is your friend. I hope that you can pull some nuggets from this post, including how symptoms can seem VERY real, and yet, not be real.\n\nI’ll leave you with this. One of my dearest friends (also a therapist) said to me, “You know, you’re really smart. So your anxiety is smart too. Of course it picked a disease that you can’t easily prove you don’t have!”\n\nFin.",

Also I find that my heart beats faster than usual and especially when taking the stairs or something like that my heart races. I wouldnt be as concerned if this happened while I was running or exercising since it would mean its probably a muscular pain.

    "selftext": " ***Sorry so long... But I need to get it off my chest-***\n\nThank God I just found this subreddit. I thought I was the only one that avoided doctors for so long after reading some threads here. See the problem is that I was in good health basically my whole life even though I avoided the doctors. Then my dear mother just died 2 months ago from (organ failure and lung cancer). She wasn't sick before she was hospitalized and was fine up until the day she was admitted. She died suddenly a few days later after we got the bad news she had lung cancer. After she died, my panic and anxiety was off to the races. My panic attacks and anxiety increased by 100 times. I got myself physically ill by grieving and crying over my mom, that my legs, feet and ankles swelled up and I got edema. Then all sorts of health shit started creeping up on me.\n\nImmediately I jumped onto the internet to google and looked up the symptoms. I kept seeing the top reason for these symptoms is congestive heart failure!! Holy Shit!!!!! I haven't left the house in over 2 years because my anxiety caused agoraphobia, but had no choice, but to force myself to go to the doctor the next day. My feet blew up so bad I couldn't even put my shoes on. My blood pressure was always perfect or actually low in the past and he said it was high when he checked me. I was like wtf? !Then he took out the EKG machine and I almost turned white and fainted from fear. I felt like running out of the fucking room.\n\nI was terrified of hearing bad news and getting a fatal diagnosis. After the EKG he told me the right side of my heart is all enlarged. I was and am terrified because I was told I need to see a cardiologist to get my heart looked at as soon as possible. I nearly shit my pants.\n\nI canceled the cardiologist appointment 3 times already because I am absolutely too terrified to go. I am scared shitless of anything to do with hearts. Hearts are one of my triggers. I fear having to have my chest cut open or needing heart surgery. The doctor had prescribed me Lipitor because my bloodwork said I had high cholesterol and he gave me water pills to stop the edema. I was supposed to go back for another checkup a week later and never showed up because I am a big pussy.\n\nI need those water pills to keep the edema and swelling down and the doctor cancelled my refill because I never showed up to the appointment. He is definitely punishing me for not showing up. Since then, both sides of my lower legs started to actually pit and cave in. I wanted to avoid going to the doctor, so I didn't tell my husband until tonight when both legs caved in even more. I showed him and the look on his face scared the shit out of me.\n\nHis face turned crimson red from anger and he started yelling and screaming at me on the top of his lungs and called me stupid and selfish and a pussy for not taking care of myself and handling my extreme doctor phobia. He said I have myself to blame for this and said I was going to kill myself and end up dead by not going to the doctor right away. He told me I am a moron too. Now I am sitting here looking at my caved in legs, knowing I need to see a regular doctor and cardiologist immediately. I am so afraid I am going to get a fatal diagnosis, that my health is falling apart and I want to scream on the top of my lungs and run away from all this fear and terror right now.\n\nOn top of it all, a month ago I willed myself to go to a dentist after I haven't gone to one in 6 years and was told I need 8 root canal surgeries and some teeth pulled and crowns. I cancelled 5 appointments already and have still yet to show up for the much needed surgeries.\n\nI feel like I am about to have a nervous breakdown, like I am losing my mind and feel all alone because my husband is irate and yelling and screaming at me. After my mother died, my health anxiety has gone off the charts and so much worse.\n\nSo basically I am so terrified of getting bad news from doctors that I am probably going to die because I am too afraid to go. Health anxiety is real and I definitely know how terrifying it is for most of you.  I told my therapist about this and she is getting on my case too like my husband (rightfully so).  I keep yessing her to death to get her off my back and tell her I will be going to the doctor soon, but keep losing my nerve to go after I am done talking to her. She must think I am a melodramatic, loony, just like my husband does. I am so afraid I am going to die that I am frozen in fear and afraid to even go to sleep because what If I die in my sleep?\n\nIf my mother were alive, she would have supported me, comforted me, spoke to me positively, not yelled and would have gone with me and helped me gain some courage. I feel like I have no support at all too. Nobody I know in my life understands how terrifying this is and just thinks I am being a total wuss and a jackass. I feel so alone and afraid right now.",

    "selftext": "It’s so weird and powerful— how our minds work. I happen to have this sort of spiraling a bunch of times over the years. My triggers are usually posts I see on social media about patients with cancers or some rare autoimmune diseases.\n\nFunny enough, my health anxiety started because of a fake news post that I saw on FB in fifth grade. It was something about eating shrimps and ingesting vitamin C at the same time. I didn’t know it was health anxiety then, I was just having panic attacks whenever I eat shrimps as I do take vitamin C daily. There was even a time that I completely avoided shrimps. Anyway, I’ve soon come to realize it was fake and I went back to eating shrimps without worry.\n\nMy actual health anxiety started five years later upon a quick google search of my arm hurting. I was a healthy 16-year old then and google said I was having a heart attack. Imagine. The. Stress. I went to a doctor and he said I was just having arm pain because of computer use. I didn’t believe him, I told my mom that I need to be in the ER pronto and undergo heart exams because of the stuff I read on the internet. She said I was just bluffing and we just went home. Since then, I’ve self-diagnosed myself with hundreds of diseases, mostly sinister ones because I tend to think of the worst case scenarios only. And up til now, I’m still alive and of relatively good health LOL. \n\nOverall, it was a crazy ride, anxiety attacks and all. And just like what my mom has said years ago, I really was just bluffing. Eventually, I overcame HA after some time. But it definitely took a while. Some days I do well in managing my mental health and doing self-care exercises. Some days it’s a downwards spiral. \n\nTalking my woes with someone (e.g. my mom, my counselor) definitely helps for me. I am less scared and more accepting of my daily/usual bodily symptoms.",

Do it for the others who may be struggling with the same worry, and do it for yourself so you can look back on your past anxieties and see how they played out.

My issues include:\n\n-when I wake up or go from the dark to a bright room my vision flickers/flashes when blinking it moving my eyes \n-normal floaters, along with 3 very small “floaters” in my right eye, I can only see them in bright conditions but they look like very small orbs or bubbles in my central vision that don’t move out of the way or float like a normal floater. Instead they move with my eye when I move it. \n-I experienced a strange bright blob in my vision off to the side of my right eye, like the afterimage of a camera flash, and could see it every time I blinked for about an hour. It faded away. A day later it happened again in the Center of my vision but that time only lasted a few seconds. \n-when closing one eye and looking at a bright surface with the other I see small flashes of light \n-if I close my left eye and try to read something on my phone with my right eye I see a blurry spot.

Most of the people who have died have had other underlying health issues or were older. \n4. All of the cases in the US were people who traveled to Wuhan. There have been no reports of human to human transmission in the US. \n5. Say you do get the coronavirus. Most people get mild cold/flu symptoms. \n6. Wash your hands. Use hand sanitizer. Stay hydrated. Eat right. DONT FUCKING GO TO SCHOOL/WORK IF YOURE SICK!!! It will help stop the spread of germs!!! \n7. Get your fucking flu shot. \n\nNone of you are going to die from the coronavirus. The flu kills more people each year (mainly the elderly/children/ people with compromised immune systems). \n\nThe media likes to hype things up to the MAX. Ia thr coronavirus a problem? Sure.

    "selftext": "This will be a rather long post. It would really mean a lot if you would take the time to read it through and comment.\n\nI am a 42 year old male, currently living in Sweden with my wife. So this all started 14 years ago, when my mother passed away in leukemia. Before that happened, i could not care less about my existense and death was never in my thoughts. \n\nBut after she had passed away, although i was convinced she was going to make it, the anxiety just rushed over me. I felt incredible stressed and this warm intense feeling just flooded me. I got tinnitus from nowhere, and that really freaked me out. I remember just sitting in front of my computer, and suddenly this sharp intense sound started in my left ear from nowhere. I panicked and just went outside walking around for hours in the cold winter night. \n\nOn top of that, i got this strange feeling of my surroundings. It was like i didnt recognize the world anymore. I remembered looking at people walking round and felt incredible insecure. It was like i couldnt understand why these people are walking around and why the things happened around me. I also got really bad sleeping problems, and became really afraid of the dark. I did not sleep a full night for a period of 2 months. \n\nUnder this period i also got sudden chest pains, and i was convinced it was a heart attack. Again, walking it off seemed to help and the pain was gone for now. \n\nI was totally fine for 14 years, and during these years i had not had a single episode of anxiety attacks. \n\nFast forward to today 2020, and my wife told me that a relative in her family was having a big setback on his cancer. \nAnd guess what, yes the famous anxiety came back. All the things i had struggled with came back in a matter of one or two days. Its strange, it doesnt appear right away when you hear about it. You just suddenly feel the anxiety rush through your body and everything is different. The whole life and surroundings feel totally strange and scary. \n\nI use to compare this feeling with waking up on a different planet, with no friends and everyone is a stranger. \n\nBut this second time i got smarter and realize the big mistake i did 14 years ago, was to not talk to someone. I tried to explain the feelings for my father, but i guess hearing these things just sounds like total bullshit if you are not facing them yourself. \n\nSo i went and talked to a professional psychologist, and it really helped. But he told me that i needed to find the reason for my anxiety attacks. Yes, the first time its obvious it was the loss of my mother. But i feel i can handle it better now, and also mention it to people without having anxiety attacks. \n\nIt took a while but now i am sure of what my second time anxiety comes from. The fact that i someday is going to die, and not exist anymore just freaks and scares the living crap out of me. Everytime i think about this, the familiar warm rushing feeling is appearing in my arms and in my stomach. I also get this depressing feeling, and is feeling that nothing is fun or worth doing since i am going to die anyway. \n\nWe also have a baby on the way which i feel is truly amazing and fantastic in any way. It is really exciting, and the thought of becoming a dad is truly refreshing. But at the same time, this feeling of knowing that i someday will be gone is incredible overwhelming. I am truly really afraid of dying and not be able to do fun things with my amazing family. \n\nI will talk about this with a psycologist. I really hope he or she can help me get out of this negative and depressing spiral. \n\nAlso, if anyone has or is experiencing the same things, dont hesitate to comment. It would really help to get to know more people facing the same problems. \n\nLastly, if you took the time to read my whole story; THANK YOU VERY MUCH!",

    "selftext": "So my health anxiety is almost entirely grounded in cancer. Today I’m worried about lymphoma and brain cancer. A month ago it was lung and digestive cancer(s). Before that leukemia and before that bone cancer. You get the gist. \n\nMy dad was diagnosed with cancer and did pass away from it. Before you freak out, he was older, active but poor poor diet his whole life. History of alcoholism. I mention this because it’s good context for my issues. My health anxiety spirals every year around this time (Jan-Mar) when he was sick. \n\nEven though I know many many statistics, about age of diagnosis and general health and this and that, it doesn’t always stop the worrying, as many of you are well aware. \n\nI tend to catastrophise. If I feel bad, it must be cancer, and since it’s cancer, I’ll die a painful death in a couple months. \n\nI typically avoid cancer stories as they trigger me up pretty badly (duh) but today I stumbled across a story of a 27 year old guy who was diagnosed with a rare brain cancer a few months ago. Today he announced he was cancer-free. \n\nThe world isn’t perfect, and it isn’t always fair. There are lots of what ifs. But I think it’s so so so important to remember the what ifs are conjecture and NOT fact. \n\nSo you go through the thing, your lymph nodes are swollen. You’re probably a little sick with a cold, or maybe you’ve been poking your neck non stop for weeks to check. So you probably don’t have lymphoma. Okay, but what if you do? Honestly, you’d probably be fine. This is not ALWAYS the case. But if we go by percentages, 99% of your worries are not cancer, or malignant, or serious at all. 75% of that 1% of real and serious conditions respond well to treatment. There’s variance but this is a great time in history to have cancer. Treatments are so plentiful and effective. Maybe you DO have brain cancer, but so? That 27 year old kid did. He’s alive and well. \n\nTo be abundantly clear, I think it’s most important to challenge false conclusions, first and foremost. Challenge your worries. If you’re in a rut though, and you just can’t shake the feeling that “THIS TIME is has to be cancer, I just know it has to be”: stay optimistic! We are a community of worriers. Challenge yourself to think of best case scenarios, even if they’re within the worst case. \n\nI’m here with you, if you’re scared of something today. And I’m so positive that we will get through it just fine, I want you to be positive of that as well :)",

    "selftext": "I've noticed that when I'm heavily anxious and panicky (which I'm excited to definitively confirm that I'm relapsing after 3 months of being pretty much normal), even pangs of hunger are translated to feeling like... foreign and borderline painful sensations. It's so bizarre. Everything just comes rushing back, like myocolonus (jerking awake during sleep due to hyperawareness), excessive thirst, what feels like fibromyalgia and travelling pains, etc... It's so crazy, to know that it's all simply because of psychosomatic/mental fixation... Being human can be freakish when we deconstruct our desensitization, and that's exactly part of why we panic and worry. Personally, I'm sure existential crises are a huge part of why I have health anxiety lol. Like, knowing how insane and fully unpredictable life/the human condition is, knowing how out of our control things can really be, the delicate fragility of life, the great unknown in the afterlife, etc... I truly don't get why/how most people DON'T have health anxiety and/or panic disorder.\n\nHOWEVER, it's been getting easier and easier to diffuse the panic and anxiety, and even if I'm relapsing, my relapses aren't nearly as bad as it first was last summer, and for that I am extremely grateful, and I'm eager to keep a positive outlook and improve my coping strategies! \n\nHell, just keep distracting the heck out of yourself with healthy, nuturing experiences. Fulfill yourself. Don't self-sabotage. Love who you are. I truly notice a huge difference in every facet of my life when I take care of myself and practice self-care in every way, and especially mitigate self-sabotage.\n\nMy best wishes to you guys. ♡",

    "selftext": "(Tldr at bottom) Hello friends, just wanted to say goodbye to this sub. Sorry for the long post, but I thought I'd share my journey with you all, since it was always gave me hope when someone else talked about how they overcame this.\n\nMy HA was really severe for a few months. There would be days where all I could do was suffer in my own head, and it was impossible for me to distract myself even for a second. Several days at a time would be just constant intense anxiety, pacing around my room, and thinking about how I'm going to die. The few seconds right after I woke up was my only relief, until I remembered my fear and everything came crashing down again. Even on good days I would spend hours and hours wasting my life away because being productive would bring my anxiety back.\n\nUltimately, there were two things that helped me out a lot. The first may not help you depending on your current fear, but I saw a specialist and asked her lots of questions. She didn't even go through with any tests because there wasn't anything that looked concerning. Understanding exactly what they look for and when my symptoms would be something to investigate further was really really helpful to me. As for how you can apply it to your situation, just be open with discussing your concerns in depth with a medical professional.\n\nThe main thing that actually cured me was triggered by some reddit post, actually. It was a news article about how some country was legalizing shrooms for treating depression. I read through the comments and there were stories of how doing shrooms just once was enough to cure them. For once in their life, they were finally able to enjoy being in the moment and everything around them was just beautiful. The experience just flipped their mindset around and changed their life for the better.\n\nI kind of took this to heart and thought I could apply the same principles to myself (without the shrooms,) so I went outside to take a walk and do some \"mental cleansing.\" It was like 3 AM and really cold, but I think it was better that way since it was a beautiful night with nobody around. First I rationalized that I can't live my life in fear - whatever happens is out of my control, but until then I have to be strong, for myself and people I care about. Realizing this fear is irrational is so important. This is not who I want to be. I want to be someone that is strong no matter what happens.\n\nThen, I just lived. I admired the stars and the trees, the christmas lights on houses around me, felt the cold wind in my face. Everything was beautiful. The world is beautiful. Sure, there is hate and disease, but there's also love and life, I didn't want to be blinded to that anymore. In that moment, I just enjoyed now. Nothing else mattered except the sensations around me and the beauty of life and nature, and all my worries melted away. It's sort of hard to describe exactly how I felt, but I hope I got my point across.\n\nNow, I feel normal and it's amazing. I truly feel that I can take on whatever life throws at me. At one point I spent a few hours intentionally reading triggering reddit posts and smiled at how they didn't affect me. In the end, my cure was within me this whole time, and I think all of your cures are buried deep down somewhere as well.\n\nSorry for the long post, but I don't really have anyone to share this with and it feels great to finally be free :)\n\nTldr; fix your mindset. All we have is right now, don't ruin that by living in the future. Once you truly enjoy the beautiful things in life, all the bad things will become insignificant.",

    "selftext": "So I have major HA and it’s mainly centered around heart issues. I’m 100% convinced my panic attacks are heart attacks, will deal with palpitations even though every cardiologist ever has said I’m fine, etc etc y’all know the drill. I am constantly running to the doctor because I just KNOW something is wrong with my heart, and he tests me for everything and always says “there’s literally nothing wrong here”. \n\nSo yesterday I was headed to brunch with some friends. My chest starts hurting. I start panicking. I convinced myself that this was a heart attack, since I have no anxiety whatsoever about seeing my besties for mimosas. I tried to distract myself by laughing and joking with my friends and quietly tried to accept my fate that I will indeed die on this day from a heart attack. Luckily it was a short drive and we arrived at the restaurant before these thoughts could culminate more. \n\nIt wasn’t until I got home that I realized the pain went away and I hadn’t even thought about it since arriving at the restaurant. The distractions of talking about the next episode of Game of Thrones, gossiping about celeb scandals, and trying to figure out which omelette to order had totally distracted me.\n\nIt’s experiences like these that show me just how anxious I really am/how strong my anxiety truly is. It’s present when I don’t even think it has a reason to be. I wasn’t having a heart attack—I was having anxiety. Still don’t know why, as I was genuinely looking forward to brunch, but that’s just another thing I need to work through and understand: my subconscious anxiety is causing these scary sensations. Those palpitations that come out of no where? That’s anxiety. Sharp chest pains that occur when I’m sitting down, watching TV? Anxiety. I don’t have to be faced with a typical “anxiety-inducing” event to struggle with the side effects of this disease. \n\nSorry if this is obvious to everyone else, but I hadn’t really come to grips with this until yesterday. Felt like a huge realization for me and wanted to share in case it helps someone else.",

    "selftext": "Quick info: Been to the ER probably 7 times since March of 2018 due to nearly every symptom you find when you look up anxiety, heart attack, and angina. Chest pain/pressure, left shoulder pain/discomfort, lightheadedness, shortness of breath, clammy hands/feet, etc. Each time, they do an EKG, xrays, and blood work that shows no sign of heart attack or damage to heart muscle. I even had a nuclear stress test done in August 2018 that came back negative as well.\n\nTo this day, I still experience the symptoms, but, as of the past week, the pain in the left side of my chest has been more constant and sharp. I've also been experiencing increased tingling and numbing from my right hand that extends all the way to the right side of my face that lasts for a minute or two and then goes away.\n\nAnother thing I will add is that I am a heavy drinker. I don't drink every day, but tend to go on binges that last several days. I am sure my alcoholism could be contributing to my condition, but I will still have these symptoms even on the days in between even when I haven't drank for weeks on end.\n\nIt doesn't seem feasible to keep going to the ER and getting stress tests, especially when I am uninsured. At what point do you just submit and tell yourself that, if you're going to have a heart attack or stroke, just let it happen to get it over with? Who else can you talk to to get a definitive answer on what, exactly, is going wrong inside your body?",

I spent a lot of time working on improving myself, strengthening my resolve and believing that my anxiety wasn't what defined me, that I could be the person I always knew I was, and that I could beat my HA.\n\nI went through therapy and many doctors visits to learn I am healthy and have the mental strength to overcome my irrational thoughts. I picked up exercise and a sport I excel at. I learned to hide my HA at work, and had many desperate and tearful calls to my partner while I sorted through my feelings. I was able to move from having anxiety everyday to every other day, to a couple times a week, to a couple times a month, to rarely. \n\nI joined this sub about 6 months ago believing this could be an outlet for me, and that maybe I could make a positive difference for people like me who were at different stages in their HA journey. I had some years of growth, and felt my experience could help. By giving advice I solidified my own beliefs, and was able to realize how I needed to listen to that voice inside that knew the rights answers; the voice I quieted in my moments of fear, where I truly believed I was one bad day away from death. That voice no longer occupies any space, and is overcome by a rational, louder voice that believes in logic a d rational thought, that can separate the real from the make believe.\n\nThank you to this community for giving me that space to help others, and in turn help myself. I think everyone who is dealing with anxiety can benefit from sharing kind words to others, as we often never share those kind words with ourselves. But by writing them out and sharing them, it helps you realize that you do have that rational and strong voice within you that can not only help others, but can also help you.\n\nStay strong, and listen to yourself. The you that exists outside of your anxiety, the friend that would help you when you're at your lowest. You can do it, I believe in you.",

Figured I'd just drop some more numbers on you to make you  feel better because I have OCD and want to give you an idea how irrational our anxiety can make us.\n\nIsrael  reported \\~60 cases of Myocarditis out of \\~5,000,000 doses which is about  0.0012%.When I had covid I obsessively checked my age groups death rate every day and it was always  \\~0.03% which is still insanely low and  unlikely to cause death. I'm only comparing the two because it makes me realize how silly I was being and that you have a far greater chance dying from covid, and dying from covid below the age of 30 is already extremely unlikely.\n\n**Based on Canadian statistics from the province of Ontario:**\n\n0.03% of my age group who contracted covid died (20 - 39). That is 1 in 3000. Google a  crowd of 3000, only 1 person will die from covid in that group.\n\n**Based on Israeli statistics (leading the world in vaccination):**\n\n0.0012%  of people who received their vaccine developed myocarditis (only 2  deaths, keep that in mind because that is significant) This is roughly 1  in 100,000. Google a crowd of 100,00 people. One person out of that crowd will develop myocarditis and that does not equal death.\n\n**Based on Israeli statistics (leading the world in vaccination):**\n\n0.00004%  of people who received the vaccine and developed myocarditis died and  there is still no CAUSAL link between the deaths and the vaccine.  That is astronomically low and you have a MUCH higher chance of walking  outside and dying from an external event.\n\nStatistic conversion chart[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK126161/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK126161/)\n\nCOVID19 Ontario epidemiology report[https://files.ontario.ca/moh-covid-19-report-en-2021-05-25.pdf](https://files.ontario.ca/moh-covid-19-report-en-2021-05-25.pdf)\n\nIsrael myocarditis findings[https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/israel-myocarditis-pfizer-vaccine/](https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/israel-myocarditis-pfizer-vaccine/)",

    "title": "A way to stop fixating on symptoms",
    "selftext": "A fellow redditor posted a question about how to deal with fixating on symptoms and I decided to share my way. Perhaps it can be helpful to someone!\n\nFor me, once I fixate on a symptom, no form of distraction works. Reading, playing games, TV, nothing. The more I try to distract myself from it, the more I notice it. So I do these steps:\n\n\n1. Accept that I'm experiencing a symptom (yes, I have a headache, yes, my heart palpitates) and remind myself it's just that - a symptom and not a full blown deadly condition like my anxiety makes it to be. \n\n.\n\n\n2. Think of three different reasons why i may be experiencing this symptom that is NOT ABOUT DYING, aka \"I have a headache because I've stared at a screen for a few hours\", \"My heart is palpitating because I ate too much sugar/I'm dehydrated\" etc.\n\n.\n\n3. Try to focus on a reason behind the symptom that's NOT ABOUT DYING. Then try to do something about it if possible. If I tell myself my palpitations are from lack of water, I refill my water bottle. If I tell myself I'm dizzy because of the lack of fresh air, I go outside for a bit etc etc.\n\n.\n\n\n4. In some cases, when I am fixated to hell and back, I confess itt to someone. Like \"Hey, I'm feeling uneasy today and I'm fixated on these palpitations! I might speak stupid stuff for a bit\". I'm lucky I have close people who get me by now. If you're all alone, message us in this subreddit! :)\n\n.\n\n5. I then spend a few hours going \"what if its actually a heart attack tho\" to my friend to which they say \"no, it's alright, you're perfectly healthy. Its like fixating on yoir tongue in your mouth and suddenly it feels weird and restless and like something Is wrong\". I say all the crazy shit that this symptom makes me think. All of them, even the silly ones like \"what of palpitations are actually my heart preparing to stop?!\" Most of the time seeing someone else completely unbothered by my panicked thoughts make me relax because my friend would be actually worried if something WAS wrong. Them being calm shows me how crazy my anxiety makes it all to look like. Once I've said it all out loud its easier to stop rethinking the same things.\n\n.\n\n6. Next Time I fixate, my Friend goes \"you're perfectly fine, you've fixated on this before and you survived it! I was there and you were fine after a while, you'll be fine again\".\n\n.\n\nSometimes when I start overthinking and going \"omg, why am i so dizzy\" my friend literally goes \"you were dizzy like this three weeks ago, water helped you last time, try that\". And it works. \n\nYou can also make a Symptoms Diary and note whenever you get a symptom and how long it lasted, what helped it go away, when it comes back etc.\nOnce I knew my heart palpitations were mostly a symptom of too much sugar and not enough water I can somewhat help myself further on. \n\nMy main point is, sometimes ignoring the symptom only makes it worse and actually facing it and your fear surrounding it is the only way to get through it. And that comes from someone who was SO fixated on their heart and breathing, that actually caused incredible stomach ache because I was breathing wrong for months because I couldn't stop fixating on the damn breathing.\n\n I had to retrain myself how to breathe properly and to finally realise that fixating on a symptom is a symptom of itself. A symptom that my health anxiety is acting up (:\n\nHope this helps!",

    "selftext": "I think I’m more writing this for my own sake but figured it might help someone (maybe, hopefully).  Take them all or take just one ☺️\n\n1. The number one golden rule of HA (y’all already know what’s coming)... never ever ever ever ever ever EVER Google anything. Resist the temptation and the urge. No matter what, do not give it. If you must pick up your phone, google something else, like “how to use reddit” lol (I’m new 😅) \n\n2. Stop looking for assurance in friends. It’s okay to talk about it if they ask you how you’re doing. But stop seeking that validation that you’re not dying. That’s almost as bad as Dr. Google himself. \n\n3. Unless you cannot breathe, are bleeding, are in excruciating pain, or something else incredibly severe, do not go to the emergency room. If you have a symptom and it’s scaring you, monitor it a bit (A LITTLE BIT, see #4) and see if it gets better or worse. Especially when you’re doing something... does the symptom go away when you’re busy and distracted? Anxiety. If the pain gets worse but you can still walk and talk? Book a doctors appointment. Chances are it’ll have gone away by then, and if not, you have something to talk about :P\n\n4. Stop checking your symptoms at every moment. It’s a hard goal, but do it in steps. You’re only going to check 5 times today. Tomorrow 4. The next day 3. Remind yourself “okay, I’ve checked once today. I’ve got two more times”. It gets easier. \n\n5. Breathe. \n\n6. Love yourself. Give yourself words of affirmation. Tell yourself you are bigger than this. Look at the birds and how they fly about... no one takes care of them, no one feeds them. They don’t get medical check ups. And they are just flying around doing their thing. \n\n7. Don’t stop your life. I know sometimes the anxiety and/or depression can weigh you down so much that you physically cannot conceive even getting out of bed, but just try. Every step is a victory. \n\n8. Pray. Meditate. \n\n9. Get counselling. If money is an issue, look for resources. Your mental health is just as important as your physical health. It is worth it. \n\n10. Don’t be too hard on yourself if you break one of these rules. One day at a time. \n\nIt’s such a struggle, and it’s going to be hard, especially in those days/moments where you can’t breathe. \n\nWhere you’ve Googled a new fatal disease and you’re planning your funeral and picturing your loved ones’ lives without you. \n\nWhen you’ve turned to your friends and family asking them about your symptoms. \n\nWhen you’re feeling that old familiar rise of fear creeping into your body and you feel your throat getting smaller at the thought of the fact that you’ve got something awful wrong with you. \n\nWhen you go to the doctors and you feel like no one is listening and every one of them is telling you that you are fine, that it’s just stress, but you KNOW your body, you know what you feel, how could it be stress?? You don’t even feel that stressed? \n\nKeep going. You are okay. ",

    "selftext": "Exactly one month ago, I decided not to use Google for health and body related topics anymore and exclude triggers from social media. It came to this point when I sneaked into my parent's bedroom to secretly grab a thermometer so that I could measure my body temperature because I couldn't go 2 hours without. I thought to myself \"this is not going to go any further\". I did not read or even engage in this subreddit for about 2 weeks now.      \n\n\nThat sobriety included googling     \n- food (positive and negative impacts)      \n- symptoms     \n- disease research     \n- \"normal\" body reactions like how body temperature changes over the day, how the menstrual cycle unfolds, normal heart rates while active,...      \n\nI also didn't measure blood pressure, heart rate and body temperature (I measured all of those at least three times a day before).      \n\nIt wasn't easy. Especially on lonely evenings when anxiety hits hard. I broke my rule once (I measured my temperature when I felt real dizzy after I had just gotten my period). Other than that, here's what happened:     \n\n- *1st:* I had so much more time! Especially while being on my phone, I actually found myself thinking \"so, what do I do here?\". I picked up on my reading again. I got up and did shit without worrying that if I get up now my heart might be overwhelmed. I just did.      \n     \n- *2nd*: SO much more brain capacity! I got excited about literature again, I took in whole books faster than I was breathing. I found myself being *bored* again, wanting to do stuff every single day. No full day of couch potatoing - not that a day like this can't be healing, but I just didn't *need* it.      \n      \n- *3rd:* I worried less and less about my symptoms and they started to fade away. I'm not going to act like I'm free of the symptom-worry-spiral now, I'm definitely not. But it did get better, knowing that I just had to live with symptoms and would not act upon them and seek reassurement. I thought: if this ache is still in this exact spot in 2 days, I'll go see a doctor. Needless to say they disappeared after a few minutes.      \n      \n- *4th:* (edited bc it's a more important point) I started to believe in myself and my future again. I could see myself in a normal working environment not being overwhelmed and stressed, but maybe even good at my future job. I found my way back to actually believing I'll not only be kind of okay but that I might have a bright future ahead of me. \n      \n- *5th:* I didn't have a single panic attack. I slept exceptionally well every night. I ordered in fish for the first time ever. I touched raw chicken. I didn't cancel anything, I even encouraged making plans with people. \n     \nThanks to this month, I understood that there actually is a way out. It's tough, but it's rewarding (and to be honest, most of the time it wasn't even tough except for some moments). I haven't gotten rid of this annoying disease but I know now that it doesn't have to be a downward spiral.      \n     \nI really hope that maybe some of you guys might have the same idea and that this text encourages you to just cut all of your safety seeking behavior out. Feel free to let me know if you tried something like this and how your sobriety turned out!      \n    \n*Tl;dr:* didn't Google or measure anything for a month and I'm alive and happy and life has gotten better, 10/10 would recommend",

    "selftext": "A few years ago I joined this sub when I was dealing with horrible health anxiety. Everything you guys are fearing -stroke, aneurism , cancer, infection, - I also feared. During the summer of 2017, my fears consumed me. I spent all day googling symptoms, shaking, crying, hyperventilating, being mistrustful of doctors, joining online communities specific to vague illnesses, trying weird diets. I did it all. \n\nAnd during that time, a prescription bottle sat in my medicine cabinet untouched For four months, I had a prescription of 10mg of lexapro that I was scared to take (like many of you, taking medications scared me). One day, I’m not exactly sure what went through my mind, but I just got sick of it. I got sick of sleepless nights and spending all day home cleaning the “germs” out of my house. I was over being consumed by my fear of death at only 21. I popped a pill in my mouth and never looked back. Since that day in September 2017, I never had another panic attack or thoughts of health anxiety again. I ended up cutting my pills in half and to this day I still only take 5mg of lexapro everyday.\n\nBecause of that medication, I got through nursing school and as a nurse, I see what truly sick people really look like! I’m not saying that to diminish anyone’s fears or feelings, but I wish I could have seen just how sick  people can be. People with cancer and infections are so sickly. Having an awareness of this then would have been comforting to me so I hope it can bring comfort to you too. You’re not sick :) you’re just  anxious and that’s okay there’s help available for you too!!  \n\nYou can get through this one way or another. Medication is not the only route but it’s the route I took that saved me! Good luck!",

    "selftext": "Hi y'all! I don't know if this has been posted here before, but I just came across by far the most comprehensive list of the physical symptoms of anxiety I've ever found. You can find it at [this link](https://www.calmclinic.com/anxiety-guide/symptoms) and then scroll down the page (anchor links don't seem to be working right for me, but just scroll and you'll find the symptoms). This apparently lists 241 unique symptoms of anxiety. The next time you're thinking \"could anxiety really be causing this?\" look here. Chances are, yes.\n\nMy favorite thing about this is the quote from the very bottom of the page:\n\n\"Anxiety really can seem to cause almost every symptom imaginable, because it does. It mimics health conditions. It can make you so sensitive to how you feel that normal perceptions feel abnormal. It can create its own issues – such as causing acid reflux, which then causes hoarseness or chronic cough.\n\nIn nearly any mental health book, the list of anxiety symptoms is extremely small, and this leads to people developing even more anxiety as they worry that they may have something else – that something else may be wrong with them.\n\nBut if you talk to people that have anxiety, do research, and learn more about the condition, you will quickly find that there are hundreds of anxiety symptoms out there.\"\n\nHope this helps someone out there! :)\n\nEDIT: I know this could possibly be construed as reinforcement for some folks, but for me it's a good first-destination; when I would google symptoms, instead I'm going to bookmark this, click on it, find my symptom here, and avoid the terrors of Dr. Google.",

    "selftext": "http://www.choosingwisely.org/patient-resources/imaging-tests-for-headaches/\n\nHere is what you need to know:\n\nHeadaches are rarely a sign of anything serious \n\nIf you got up this morning without having any of the following you are completely fine; a seizure, vomiting, having pain that feels like an axe was embedded inside your head, dizziness, trouble walking, forgetting your name, or having trouble reading something up close. Do also note that these things can be caused by many other causes as well. \n\nCancer in young people is extremely rare and so are neurological problems. The reason why is because your immune system is much stronger when you’re younger. \n\nYoung people who have cancer are almost always going to live longer than five years. Dying due to cancer is almost unheard of under the age of 50. \n\nCancers and other major problems are always noticeable and grow rapidly in young people. \n\nCT and MRI scans are almost always useless if you are healthy.\n\nMany of the symptoms of brain cancer are not caused by any underlying problems. These symptoms include temporary loss of balance,  twitching, muscle jerks, brain fog, messing up/misspelling a word, forgetting something, and headaches. Trust me these symptoms are more common than you think \n\nSo in conclusion brain cancers and every other cancer should be the least of your worries especially if you are young and healthy. I am not reassuring that you don’t have it I am however showing you that worrying about something that almost never happens is a waste of time. Anxiety can waste minutes hours days months or even years of your life. Now I know this probably isn’t going to stop you from worrying about your symptoms but the more you try to seek out reassurance from both Reddit and the internet, the more you’re going to panic. What you need to do is find a way to break your vicious HA circle and break it now before it gets worse.",

    "selftext": "I say gradual... it's not. I've posted on every damned group available; not so much fuelling my reassurance bank but just out of general concern. \n\nI've had weird chest pains which jolt my left side, centre of left man boob and then my ribs and sternum. This, this caused my anxiety to sky-rocket on the 12 of August. I'm a writer for a living, so I'm constantly hunched over, and I'm a new dad which brings with it the odd muscle strain (at least that's what I'm telling myself). I'm perfectly healthy heart-wise. Body-wise? Weighed in at 120 kgs, now in a month I'm at 110. Obviously with that comes \"Ah! The cancer I have been Googling about!\" \n\nHowever, because I'm apparently dying every second, every little ache and pain (especially the \"pulled muscle\" chest pain) causes me to stand up with a fright, rub my \"itchy\" head and pace around wondering what I'm going to wear to the hospital so I don't completely look like an overweight homeless dude who is either having a heart attack, stroke, or other strange extraterrestrial disease I have concocted in my head. \n\nAs a 24-year old, I'm fine. I'm not dying. I took Citalopram for about a week and told myself \"this is not who you are\". But, as any young adult, or any adult who works long hours in an office, we all feel muscle tension and stiffness in our arms, chest, back, legs - all because we're zombies who just live paycheck to paycheck. \n\nWhen I get wrist pain and elbow pain and shoulder pain and - yes - even neck pain, I fret over the \"next\" heart attack and stroke. Even an aneurysm. Then, after the heart has stopped beating so fast because I realise I'm young, anxious, and have a son who I adore and want to see grow up, I calm down and call myself names. \n\nWe're sensitive. We're like ice cubes in the sun. One little thing, one little tingle in the toe, can set us off. We melt away and we become others outside and next to ourselves. I hate it. I understand there are some people on this sub who have concerns that may actually be warranted...but 96% of the time, we're allowing the little goblin in our minds to play havoc. \n\nIf you're reading this, release your shoulders. Move your neck around, sit up straight. What I've come learn is that I'm always tense even if I don't mean to be. I catch it. I catch myself slouching, sitting on my phone too long, arms bent, neck drooped halfway down to the Earth's core. \n\nYes, we can't control it. I have at least five to six \"impending heart attacks and strokes\" a day. But we can try - gradually - to deal with it. Medication, CBT, yoga, those two small chocolates from last year that you are adamant are the reason why your anxiety is so bad. We're all in the same boat. I have strange phobias: loud noises, bugs (which I'm afraid will climb in my ears), choking. I had issues with showering, being on the toilet for too long, standing too long, not waking up after a nap. Even tying my shoelaces - might have a heart attack from bending over. \n\nThe reason I am writing this is because I was home alone for a while. My wife went out to the shop. Obviously, with nothing really to do, I started thinking. Just casual \"let me Google why my headache is a tingly feeling\". Not a great idea. Why? Because I convinced myself that I was having a stroke. My stomach, at this very moment, is mildly sore - which means I'm hungry - but because of the heightened sense of pain, of unreality, I convinced myself as well that I had ruptured my spleen or have appendicitis. I'm just hungry and finished off my second cup of coffee (again, coffee is giving me high cholesterol, which will give me a heart attack- which it's not...unless, obviously, I have at least eight cups a day and eat horribly). \n\nBest advice I ever received was from my mom. \"Stop overthinking it. If you're having a heart attack, go for a walk\". Sounds bad. But it's the reality of the situation - if you can exercise, like a walk, you're not having a heart attack. If you are having a stroke, you certainly won't be able to get up and choose an outfit for your hospital trip, pack a bag, and then having a quick and quiet smoke. \n\nI apologize. But I'm tired. Laughably, I'm more of a baby than my baby. At least when he gets a slight knock he soldiers on, unlike me who has some serious disease because I'm bleeding so profusely from a paper cut. Yes, this is a serious mental condition which affects millions and millions of people. It can be manageable. This doesn't mean our lives are over. You are not the only one. Look at this sub and how many people are on here. My first day on here I discovered my \"lung cancer\" was the same as someone else's costochondritis. We seek support, we seek isolation, we seek support again. \n\nI don't know what the hell kind of post this is, but I'm, generally, a hypochondriac. Simplest way to describe. Someone on here suggested updating our posts every two days so as to prove to ourselves that we are not dying today. That is pure gold. I have been doing it, and it helps. Find that post and read it. \n\nRegards, just one of the millions.",

    "title": "Made a Word Document to help my health anxiety and it’s actually been working! Here’s what I wrote...",
    "selftext": "Hi guys! \n\nI have really bad health anxiety and usually can’t stop myself from overanalyzing my symptoms and then googling them and being SUPER convinced that I have some major health issue, leading to some absolutely insane anxiety which doesn’t let me do anything in the day. I even start looking at all the possible treatment options (in a lot of detail) and am usually convinced I’d need a big surgery. This usually leads to sleepless nights and noticing my symptoms even more than usual. My own history of actual health issues and major surgeries doesn’t help with this at all! \n\nBUT, recently I wrote out a word document for myself to read whenever I feel the need to start searching symptoms on Google. It’s actually been helping calm me!! \n\nSo I’d like to roughly share the stuff I wrote. You could hand write these things in a diary or on paper, or you could type it on word doc as I did, whatever works better. \n\n1. I made a list of ALL the health anxiety incidents I’ve had in the past which ended being nothing. I basically listed all the health issues which I thought would end in something extreme but they either fizzled out themselves, or the treatment I went for actually helped. In other words, list all the times you had more anxiety about your symptoms than it was needed or than it was helpful. I’ve even had incidents of Google misdiagnosing me (of course!) and me going to the doctor after a while and finding out that the issue I have is something else altogether. So my Google searching was completely useless and only caused anxiety, no actual solutions or help. Listing down actual historical evidence of your anxiety deceiving you can really help so that’s what I started with. \n2. List down all the health issues you’ve ACTUALLY had and they’ve actually been annoying/painful to deal with BUT you’ve recovered and you’re free from them now. Even the smaller things. \n3. I then wrote a paragraph to convince myself why Google searching my symptoms would be stupid. Here’s kind of what I wrote (the summary of it at least): If any symptoms are worrisome enough to sit and Google and then spend days convinced that I have the worst illness ever and I’ll never recover, then it’s better to just TAKE AN APPOINTMENT with an ACTUAL MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL. Instead of spending time on Google to search symptoms and act like I’M a Doctor, I should spend that time researching on who are the best medical professional for the symptoms I’m experiencing so that I take an appointment with somebody experienced and known to actually help people heal and recover. Once I take the appointment, I promise myself to NOT Google symptoms for the days until the actual appointment. Me googling symptoms won’t change the outcome of what the medical professional feels about my symptoms. It also won’t help me heal or feel better. It is useless to me. It is unhelpful. If any tests are needed, my doctor will tell me to do so. Me reading things beforehand and freaking out will only ruin MY peace and my free time. I will physically delay this anxiety until I actually meet my doctor and actually know what’s up. \n4. Then I wrote a small letter of encouragement just in case I’m freaking out about “okay but WHAT IF I have a really serious illness... then WHAT!” ... so my letter of encouragement basically told me that I have the strength to deal with anything life throws at me and that even if I do have some actual bodily issues, I will do something about it and get it treated and will fully recover. This is when the list of actual health issues you’ve dealt with and recovered or managed helps to convince yourself that you’ve dealt with a lot and you can deal with a health issue too. \n5. Make a list of things to do to distract yourself whenever you feel the anxiety, overanalysing of your body’s symptoms, and need to Google slip back in. \n\nOkay, I’m done! You could add more points to the list if you’d like. These are just some ideas I had. \n\nOf course this may not cure your health anxiety, but it does help change your thoughts slightly. It helped changed mine at least and I can only hope that it helps even one of you. And according to psychology, we do know that one FEELS anxiety just because of one’s unhealthy/negative/false THOUGHTS (think, feel, behave right!) so if we can work to change the THINK aspect, of course it’ll alter the feel and behave. \n\nWishing everyone the best of luck when it comes to dealing with this horrible, horrible health anxiety.",

I felt amazing. All my anxiety was gone. I felt like a normal person for the rest of that day. All my stupid health anxiety was gone out of the window.

    "title": "Health Anxiety - How it started and how I ended it quickly. My story",
    "selftext": "I've recently got through health anxiety and wanted to use my experience to help others. I've waffled on a bit so if you don't want to read it all please just read the top 2 points as they are the key. I can guarantee reading this is better time spent than googling symptoms. \n\nKnow your enemy\n\nAs you are on a health anxiety page you've likely had confusingly clear test results and already know your enemy isn't Cancer MS, HIV etc. It's anxiety.\n\nDon't underestimate your enemy\n\nFeeling physical symptoms that cannot possibly be anxiety? Wrong. The effects it can have on your body can be very physical, very painful, very scary and very real. \n\nI'll have to start my story part-way through. I was running up the stairs at work to get to my desk in time and slipped. I fell awkwardly on the hand rail and heard and felt a rib crack. Work was a nightmare and had been for weeks. I'd just become the manager of a new team and things were going wrong. I carried on up the stairs in pain and a few days later went to hospital. I had a chest Xray and they confirmed a fractured rib. Work got worse and my cat became very ill (and I really love my cat). \n\nLooking back all the signs were there months before this. Each time something stressful happened I got all hot, felt sick and lost my appetite. At the time I didn't think much of it. Then one morning everything changed. \n\nA couple of days later, I woke up with what felt like a burning hot hand squeezing my heart. I couldn't breathe properly as I started to panic. I ask my girlfriend to take me to the emergency department and I genuinely thought I was going to die. I even kissed my cat goodbye thinking I'd never see her again. I got seen straight away. After an ECG and blood tests and a few hours of waiting, my chest had settled but was incredibly tight. I was asked if I had eaten anything yet. As I got there at 6am I said no. I was given toast and paracetamol and told there was nothing wrong with me and was shortly after sent home. I think leaving without an answer was a real tipping point. \n\nI took 3 weeks off work and in that time my body and mind spiralled downwards. I kept catastrophizing. What if I get fired from my job? What if I can't work again and have to sell my house? What if I am seriously I'll…? And that one stuck. \n\nMeanwhile my body was malfunctioning all over the place. My bowel habits changed for the worse, my digestion was all wrong with reflux and heartburn. I felt so weak and light headed. Then overnight I developed excruciating back pain that radiated up my neck. I was sure now that the doctors had made a mistake and that my attack that day was something more. \n\nThis carried on at varying degrees for months. Deep down I kind of felt I can't be that Ill as I went on holiday twice and felt a bit better when I was away. But then at it's worse I couldn't leave the house. I even text my girlfriend when she was at work to say I had a flesh eating skin disease. Now known as a blister in my toe...\n\nI fell into the trap of googling symptoms and trying to use the internet for reassurance. I'd diagnose myself first with a stomach ulcer, then gallbladder disease then pancreatic cancer. New ones each week. Each time the doctor sent me for the tests which came back clear putting me back to square one believing it was me against the doctors who kept missing things. \n\nOne day after I had made 4 diagnoses in one day I felt enough was enough and contacted a councillor who fitted me in that day. She took me to the beginning of the story.\n\nI just wanted her to fix me and was puzzled why she was asking about recent bereavements. Earlier in the year I had been at a close relatives bed side when they died and my dad had a very risky operation that was 50/50 if he would make it. I thought I had dealt with that. I got back into my car after the therapy session and was in tears. Obviously I hadn't.\n\nShe also made me think about what my triggers were. My back ache had worn off a little in recent weeks. A stressful conversation with my boss on the phone and it was back with a vengeance. So the link in my brain was now correctly back ache due to anxiety rather than back ache due to randomly malfunctioning organ. \n\nI also went to my GP who put me on sertraline which is a commonly used antidepressant for anxiety. The side effects were difficult at first. In fact 3 days in I was having panic attacks but after a week the side effects subsided. After 4 weeks my physical symptoms virtually disappeared. My health anxiety went with those pretty much.\n\nI suppose humans are great at suppressing the knowledge that we are all going to die some day otherwise life wouldn't be much fun. I think my experiences with death and illness of people close to me stopped me suppressing that and my stress and anxiety at the time made me relate it to myself. \n\nSo relating all of that together, here is my advice:\n\nCBT. I have an app called Quirk that really helps. It gets you into the habit of challenging those irrational thoughts. If apps aren't your thing, imagine you are in a courtroom being cross examined for your irrational thought, being pressed for the actual evidence etc. Your brain carves out a path and the more you think the same, the better and easier that path becomes for your brain. Challenge this path to start closing it off. \n\n\nMedication. I'd never taken antidepressants before and never wanted to but the truth is they just calmed my whole body down (after the side effects). My physical symptoms reduced greatly which was a game changer. Not saying they are right for everyone. Speak to your doctor of course. I'm definitely not a doctor.\n\n\nTherapy. I was lucky enough to afford private therapy straight away. I would recommend it to anyone. They really get to the root cause. She helped me break the cycle by getting me to relate my symptoms to anxiety triggers and not other illnesses. \n\n\nLifestyle changes. Exercise helps but fitness isn't for everyone. I'm a much more creative person so I forced myself to write some music and did things I enjoy. Whatever you do to enjoy yourself is better than sat worrying and googling symptoms.\n\n\nWork out your triggers. If a certain situation results in a certain symptom, this realisation can help immensely. \n\nDont rule out anxiety just because one of your many symptoms isn't on a list. We are all different. \n\n\nDO NOT Google symptoms. If doctor google was real he would have been struck off by now for getting everything wrong. \n\n\nDo not seek reassurance from statistics. If it says 1 in a million people your age will get this illness, you will still focus on the 1.\n\n\nDo not seek confirmation of your self diagnosis from friends or family. This will only reinforce the faulty path your brain keeps sending signals down. Tell them to shut you down if you talk about health. \n\n\nKeep busy and productive while taking care of yourself. If a friend was going through a tough time you'd but them a gift etc right?. Do it for yourself.\n\n\nAbove all, if you have got this far you know its anxiety so take control and be proactive about fixing yourself. \n\n\nHope this helps someone. Happy to talk to anyone going through this as it is horrible to go through. You will be ok.",

    "selftext": "Hi, everyone.  \n\nThis post has ended up pretty long, sorry!\n\nI recently found this community, and it's comforting that I'm not alone in experiencing health anxiety. (Though it's sad to see that others are struggling so much with it, as well.)\n\nI won't delve very far into how mine developed, but I've come to terms with the fact that I've experienced this for almost a decade. Over that decade, I have \"had\" cancer, parasites, HIV/AIDS, tetanus, and a plethora of other diseases and conditions. I find myself obsessing over the health of myself and my loved ones, and I tend to misinterpret sensations in my body that are likely normal and warp them into something terrifying. I can see this clearly now, but it's so incredibly scary during my \"episodes\". \n\nWhile this is horribly inconvenient and terrifying for me, it does provide some pretty great stories to tell-- like the time recently that I was convinced that I was dying (again) and ended up (surprise!)... not dying.\n\nI was eating popcorn one afternoon and noticed a sudden pain in my gums, above my top teeth. I felt around some and came across a painful bump, near the front of my mouth. Of course, I ran to my bathroom, panicked, to look at this bump closer. It was raised and discolored-- a weird brownish-yellow color-- with the gums around it appearing irritated and red. \n\nI was distraught. Everyone tells you when you bring up health anxiety to not Google anything, but when you've already Googled so much before, you have a lot of information, symptoms, and diseases that you're able to go through in your head and panic about. So of course, this raised bump on the gums of a 21 year old who had never touched tobacco in their life was oral cancer.\n\nI cried for days. I couldn't sleep, I was afraid to eat, as to irritate it more. I was constantly poking around my mouth and spending time in front of the mirror examining it. I Googled mortality rates and pictures and types of treatments I would have to undergo for it. I finally made an appointment with my dentist and waited for the worst.\n\nAnd then one day, several days after I found this bump, I brushed my teeth. And after I was finished, I felt a sharpness in my mouth. I moved my hand up to feel what it was and was surprised to find a piece of a popcorn kernel.\n\nI went back to the mirror and the \"cancer\" was gone. The raised \"discoloration\" was the brown coloring of a piece of a popcorn kernel that was pressed flat against my gums. \n\nAnd yet again, I was proven wrong. I was not dying. Especially not of something as out-there as that.\n\nI guess my point here is that I've done this so many times. It's a cycle of seeing or feeling something in or on my body that I perceive as \"strange\", catastrophizing until I'm not able to function because I am so distraught and despondent, and then finally being \"proven wrong\" or the problem never coming to fruition. It's so hard to see in the moment, but it always ends up fine.\n\nIt was really nice to get this off my chest, and I hope that I can look back on this during my next, inevitable \"episode\" and see how silly I looked for sobbing over a popcorn kernel. I hope that if you're reading this and struggling, that you can laugh at me and maybe feel that your issue will turn out to be something trivial, too.",

    "title": "How recovering from Anxiety and Panic Attack looks like (Advice from a former sufferer)",
    "selftext": "I know everyone here is trying to find answers to cope and overcome their health anxiety. And as someone who has fully recovered, I've noticed besides many don't really know how recovery looks like. If you understand how recovery looks like, I believe you won't fall into anxiety cure gimmicks.\n\nBecause people don't really talk about how recovery looks like, even when you are making progress, its easy to self-sabotage and get discouraged during the recovery journey.\n\nI wanted to give some steps on how recovery looks like. I recovered without any meds, or supplements btw. I focused on acceptance, exposure, and patience (I talk more about recovery below).\n\nEveryone is different, and everyone is struggling with different aspects of anxiety (derealization, physical symptoms, panic attacks, obsessive \"what if\" thinking), but much of the core recovery are still the same across the board. I found my recovery (and those I've helped) follow this pattern. The recovery journey goes something like this:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. If you struggle with panic attacks, this is the first thing to go away. Much of this is because you lose the fear of panic attacks. much of the fear is what keeps panic attacks alive for longer and more frequent. Once you lose the fear, it disappears pretty quick.\n2. Anxiety still remains high, so you will still feel feelings of derealization, depersonalization, physical symptoms, what if thoughts. But the intensity decreases.  **This is quite stubborn**. As your nerves are sensitized, and your nerves won't calm down so easily (there are survival advantages to this). As anxiety decreases, the \"what if\" thinking also decreases. Physical symptoms lose intensity, but are still present.\n3. You begin feeling glimpses of some freedom from anxiety in this step. Your fear now shifts from \"anxiety\" to \"what if the anxiety comes back?\" As you start getting better the glimpses of freedom get longer and longer\n4. Getting hit with setback. There will be multiple triggers during recovery that will convince you that you haven't made any progress. **You have.** Keep moving forward. As you continue you journey, setbacks become less frequent and less intense.\n5. Anxiety eventually disappears, but you don't know when it left you because after a while, you stop caring....you are too focused on living. Eventually physical symptoms, derealization, and everything disappear last (at least for me, and many of the people I help). Physical symptoms and derealization/DP lose intensity throughout the progress of recovery, so your confidence has grown during the entire duration of recovery.\n\nI've created a video to really dive deep into the steps of recovery in the link below. I also talk about what I did to recover in way more depth in the link below.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=408IbCTcF\\_M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=408IbCTcF_M)\n\nI hope this inspires some hope and minimizes much of the confusion around recovery.\n\nBest of luck to you all!",

It was over before I even knew it had started, and I waited for 30 minutes.  She asked if I felt okay.  I did, and she told me I was welcome to sit with her as long as I liked.  I left and sat in a parking lot close to the hospital for awhile, then went home.  And I’m fine!  I am so happy I went through with it!

    "selftext": "Background - About 4 weeks ago I started having a dull pain in my left hamstring, a couple inches above the back of the knee.  It comes and goes, and gets better or worse with stretching.  It bothers me most when I’m sitting in a chair.  No other classic DVT symptoms like redness, swelling, intense pain, etc.  I showed my doctor during a routine physical exam and he said it seemed muscular and we didn’t need to bother with a clot test (he stretched both legs and both were tight, although the left was slightly tighter).\n\nA couple days after that exam, I started getting a dull pain in my right/back rib area.  At first it was when I inhaled, but I noticed it also did it when I bent / stretched in certain ways.  I tried to ignore it as another muscular issue.  It hasn’t fully gone away (about two weeks later now), although I only feel it when moving certain ways.  And even then it’s a very minor ache - no classic PE symptoms like low oxygen, intense pain, shortness of breath, super fast pulse.\n\nAnyway, I am trying to accept my original doctor’s diagnosis and move on with my life.\n But I can’t get the nagging DVT / PE thoughts out of my head.  Just looking for any support or advice.  I have flip-flopped between doing nothing, going for a second opinion, going to urgent care, or going to the ER (depending on how I feel that day).\n\nSome random questions I’ve had during this adventure if anyone wants to comment ..\n\n- I know like every scary health issue there is some chance of having clots with only minor symptoms.  That is probably super rare though right?\n\n- Don’t clots progress quickly?  I have a feeling you wouldn’t have a clot for weeks and weeks with only minor symptoms (much less multiple clots).\n\n- Clots wouldn’t present themselves like muscular pains right?  Or be better / worse with stretching?  This is the one I wonder the most.\n Rationally I’m pretty sure the answer is no, but I think this thought is the one that fuels my remaining anxiety about all this.\n\nAnyway, I am working on de-stressing, meditating, exercising, and practicing what I learned in therapy (which includes trusting your doctor’s opinion the first time, if you have to go at all).  But it is difficult for physical symptoms like this .. any support would be great!",

    "title": "I have not had a panic attack in three years. You CAN overcome this. (My story)",
    "selftext": "My anxiety began about 6 years ago from smoking a really potent strand of marijuana. I had my first panic attack while I was extremely high and thought I was going to die. Ever since that moment, I had a chain reaction of DAILY panic attacks for about 6 months. It was awful. I made my husband take me to the ER so many times, convinced I was dying.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI didn't understand why my body was doing this, and it created an extreme hypochondriac version of myself. I couldn't get off of Google. I had convinced myself I had MS, ALS, Parkinsons, brain tumors, cancer, blood disorders, liver conditions. You name it.  The thing about health anxiety is that when you read about symptoms and convince yourself you have symptoms, your brain plays a tricky game on you where it begins to CREATE those symptoms. Our brains are a VERY powerful thing. We still don't fully understand them, but I assure you our brains very much have the power to create symptoms from merely being scared of getting them. We have Lizard Brains. In all of our years of evolution, our brains STILL have the 'ol Fight or Flight system. We are creatures of incredibly complex thoughts. Our brains have one focused end goal it is always trying to achieve: survival. Because of this, our brains LOVE to worry, so we can create ways to survive. Although useful, this has turned into an extremely harmful thing when misused by hypochondriacs. We are constantly worrying, constantly trying to find ways to overcome hidden diseases that aren't even there.\n\nTrust me, I have been there, and was there for several years. But I have not had a panic attack in three years, and when I do get bouts of anxiety, I can overcome it within 1-3 minutes. Aside from the usual suggestions on here which I fully endorse:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Exercise/walking.\n2. Practice mindfulness/meditation\n3. Supplement with magnesium or adaptogens like Ashwagandha.\n4. GET OFF GOOGLE. Look, Google can be helpful. I still find myself using it to research symptoms, but I made myself a rule: Only Google a symptom if I have been enduring it for longer than 1-2 weeks. If I am still having issues, evaluate everything going on in my life. Is something I am doing causing this symptom? Stress? An injury? Am I not drinking enough water? Not getting enough sleep? What has my diet been like? If the symptom is effecting me severely for more than a week or two (which it hardly ever does because I will not Google it), then maybe I can see if it's something worth looking into, so I can find other options to help myself.\n5. Gratitude Journal. Seriously. The more I focus on the good things I have going on in my life, and the more I practice telling people thank you, smelling the air, getting out in the sunshine, the less power anxiety has over me.\n6. Nature. Being in nature is SO POWERFUL. I remember when I used to have anxiety attacks, if I went outside and walked around, my panic attack would melt away pretty quickly. There are all kinds of studies on the effects that nature has on us. Obviously this is hard during winter, but things I have found to combat that are: Filling my home with lots of plants and absorbing myself and being a good plant parent. Going to the conservatory.\n7. Hugs. Seriously. Another thing that I find EXTREMELY RELAXING is hugging. There is also quite a lot of research on this as well.\n8. Belly/diaphragm breathing.\n9. Diet. I know this is always brought up, but man is it true. A lot of the foods we consume fuck with our blood sugar and impair our body's ability to cope with stress. \n\n**THE BEST THING I DID FOR MY HEALTH ANXIETY WAS PURCHASING THE BOOK:**  [Dare: The New Way to End Anxiety and Stop Panic Attacks](https://www.amazon.com/Dare-Anxiety-Stop-Panic-Attacks/dp/0956596258/ref=sr_1_3?crid=3OI9PGNR9RCL7&keywords=dare+the+new+way+to+end+anxiety&qid=1580776260&sprefix=dare+to+end%2Caps%2C159&sr=8-3). I do not have enough good things to say about this book. It changed my life. A huge component of this book is that HOW we react and BY REACTING to panic attacks is what keeps triggering them. Our fear of fear is what keeps triggering the constant fear. It has a simple solution, but takes time and patience, and can be very uncomfortable. It won't end getting feelings of anxiety, but it gives you the tools to let those feelings be small and fleeting, so you can easily move on. The book also comes with a link to his app, which has a lot of great audio content to get you through a panic attack when you are having one, which I used to use on the airplane.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen we feel anxiety coming on and we think, *\"oh shit, not now, fuck, how do i get through this? I need to calm down, it's ok, it's ok!\"* we are validating the anxiety, and confirming to ourselves that these feelings of anxiousness are something to be scared of, and something that we need to immediately be relieved of. We are training our brains to REACT to anxiety, instead of simply letting it be there, and then move on from it. My saving grace is picturing my anxiety as an adolescent version of myself. When anxiety pops up in my body, I immediately envision myself holding the hand of the \"child version\" of myself and thinking, \"Oh, hey! Wow, it is so nice to have you back! I am just going to the grocery store *(or whatever activity you are doing at the moment)*, want to come along? Let's go together.  It will be so fun!\" Sometimes I envision my childlike version of myself as anxiety reincarnated, and then I take sympathy for this anxiety kid-version of myself and envision myself nurturing them. Throughout the panic/anxiety, I will think to myself, \"is this all you got? Because I actually forgot how much I love feeling dizzy and how much I love trembling. It actually makes me feel alive. Bring it on, I can take more!\"\n\nWhen you feel anxiety coming on, you have to start training your brain to WELCOME IT. This is uncomfortable at first. Who wants to be facing an oncoming panic attack and think, \"WOOHOO YOU'RE FINALLY HERE!\" but I swear to you, it works. It takes patience, consistency, and follow through, but this method seriously saved my life. When we start associating anxiety as a passing thought, something that is normal and boring, your brain will stop associating the feeling of anxiety as something to freak the fuck out over.\n\nEven the first time I tried this, I was surprised with how fast the attack/anxiety passed. The more you begin to destruct how you react to anxiety, the quicker the anxiety attack will pass each time you have an episode. Anxiety is created by our brains/nervous system, and therefore we need to begin retraining our brains. When you start to panic over symptoms, think to yourself,  I have an extremely powerful, capable body, and I am MUCH STRONGER than I give myself credit for. I have overcome this anxiety before, and it will pass again. My body is tricking me. I am just going to continue doing XXX activity, and if these symptoms want to come along, then that is fine. They can be there. We can co-exist because I know it is just going to pass. But I am going to bring my attention to this thing I am doing now.\"\n\nI promise you, you can beat health anxiety by having the tools to not let it consume you. We will always be more sensitive to symptoms, but we can absolutely have the tools to not freak out over it, and ruin our days. Let me know if you have any questions. I recently saw I was still subscribed to this sub and wanted to let everyone know that there is hope.",

    "selftext": "I've been struggling with a horrible anxiety flare-up for the past 7 weeks. I've made plenty of other posts if you want more details. Basically it's hit a new peak this past week. It started after my family left for a camping trip and I went to stay with some friends. I've had the \"I'm gonna die\" feeling and the other physical symptoms since this started but they began feeling worse. Eventually after hours of struggling on Saturday I had a panic attack much worse than my previous two. I actually thought I was going to die. I ended up passing out from hyperventilating and drinking too much water (leading to dangerously low salt levels) and having a seizure, ending up in the hospital. I'm still traumatized from the experience.\n\nI was literally just with the doctor yesterday. He told me I was fine and not to worry about my heart. That should be enough to get rid of this feeling, but despite all the times I'm told that I'm not dying I still fucking feel like I'm dying and it gets worse every day. \n\nIt's hard for me to describe. I get extremely dissociated and feel like I'm watching an artificial version of my life on a TV screen. And it's scary because my brain thinks I'm drifting away from reality. It's like my life is the show and my body and brain hate watching it so they're trying to turn it off. This combined with the physical symptoms (heart palpitations, numbness, chest tightness, trouble breathing, shakiness, nausea, popping ears, head pressure, diarrhea, lightheadedness, dizziness, left arm pain, blurred and sometimes distorted vision, intrusive thoughts, and overanalyzing every tiny fucking little feeling) creates this constant feeling that I am about to pass out or die.\n\nI don't know what to do. It keeps getting worse every day. I'm not able to go to the store anymore. I can't get sleep because I'm scared of dying in my sleep. I'm tired of being told \"distract yourself by watching TV\" or \"go outside\" as if that will magically cure me. I can never do the breathing exercises or meditation because of how difficult it is for me to breathe steadily. I try my hardest to ignore it and move on to something else but it is just so crippling. And on top of this I convienientely caught a cold today so I get many more feelings to overanalyze.\n\nI'm going to go to therapy soon once I find a good plan. The hospital took me off of Prozac but I did start Adavan recently. Sorry for the long rant. I'm just totally hopeless and scared.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone. I'm doing a lot better than when I started. I saw someone a few months ago lament that those who recover leave the subreddit, so we never learn how to get better. I promised that when I recovered I'd try to contribute. So here is my attempt. Many of us have likely searched for \"can anxiety cause X, Y, or Z\" in an attempt to comfort ourselves that our symptoms are mental, not physical. So I am providing a list of physical symptoms anxiety has caused me. With most of these, I have sought medical help. With all of these, enough time has based that it is surely not cancer, strokes, terrible infectious disease, or some awful thing causing it. Thus, anxiety or some benign spurious cause is the most likely culprit. Perhaps others could comment with their physical symptoms as well.\n\n1. Head aches\n2. Really bad head aches.\n3. Pressure in my head (as if I were underwater or in an airplane).\n4. Tingling on the side of my head, on my face, fingers, and toes.\n5. A bizarre tingling sensation crawling down my face.\n6. Both arms, legs, and my face feeling like they are falling asleep simultaneously.\n7. Feelings of being disconnected with reality.\n8. Certainty that some terrible health-related catastrophe will strike me within seconds.\n9. Dizziness\n10. Intense vertigo lasting up to eight hours per day.\n11. Heart palpitations\n12. Chest pains\n13. Blurring, throbbing peripheral vision.\n14. Random tingling, almost numbish spots.\n15. Tingling sensations shooting down my arms when I move them\n16. Waking up with my arms, legs, eyeballs, and tongue moving rhythmically\n17. Symptoms resembling a urinary tract infection (decrease strength of urine stream, increased frequency of urination, pain in the bladder area, bladder feeling more full relative to how much I urinate) with a clean urinalysis and urine culture.\n18. Stomach pains, diarrhea, and also gastrointestinal symptoms.\n19. Extreme discomfort and feelings of sensory-overload with light and sound.\n20. Dozing off then snapping back into reality forgetting what had happened.\n21. Forgetfulness, including of recent events (how did that get there)?\n22. Thinking it is the wrong year.\n23. Difficulty falling asleep\n24. Difficulty waking up\n25. Exhaustion\n26. Scary things happening while I work out, making me think I'm having a stroke, heart problems, or something wrong with my head.\n27. Mood changes\n28. Depression\n29. Muscle cramps\n30. Sexual dysfunction \n31. Weight loss, even when taking a break from diet and exercise\n\nI'm not telling anyone not to get things checked out. But as my neurologist told me, anxiety can mimic virtually anything physically. I also want people to know that I am doing really well right now, despite having very crippling, extreme health anxiety in the past. Prayer, therapy, and medication have helped me recover a lot. I am even weaning off one of my medications now. In the past, I was able to wean off everything and stayed healthy for years. I'm currently recovering from a relapse.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions. I've been incredibly blessed by this subreddit and would count it a personal blessing to pay it forward and help those who went through went I went through. I don't consider myself a very strong person, so I really think if I can get through it, you can too.",

The next day I ran to my GP to express my concerns, he didn’t seem worried and just gave me a course of antibiotics.

The doctors assure me that everything’s fine because I don’t seem to show any of the red flags like lymph nodes enlarging, seizures etc. I’ve come to accept the fact that I’m struggling with health anxiety that has manifested into different physical symptoms.

    "selftext": "I woke up today and realized I haven't had a major health anxiety flare up for at least half a year now. Maybe even longer. Two or three years ago I used to be very bad. I visited the doctors constantly finding new symptoms and changes in myself and trying to fix my anxiety, but I always felt like nothing worked and I was afraid that I'll never get better.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter I started CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy), I started getting better ever so slowly. It was a lot of work and at times it got worse, a lot worse, before it got better. I learned so much about myself and about ways to deal and live with my thoughts, emotions and ultimately anxiety.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSometimes the unwanted thoughts and emotions come back. Sometimes I notice symptoms that trigger said feelings. But the thing is, I can deal with them. Two years ago I would've sent myself to a downwards spiral over things I can just brush off my head and deal with a clear mind today.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not perfect and I know that I will have difficult times ahead of me some time in the future. In some way I know I will deal with these emotions and thoughts in some form or another for the rest of my life. The thing is, I trust myself that I can deal with it and make it through come whatever may. I'm stronger and more resilient than I was ever before.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI want to share some thoughts and tips with you that have helped me along the way. I'm not a medical or healthcare professional so don't take any of this as such advice. Just a friend giving advice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Be prepared to put in a lot of work. Your mind won't heal itself. Even going to therapy won't magically fix you. The only thing that can fix you and your mind, is you. Therapy, counselling and other help is an invaluable tool to get you started, track and direct your progress, but in the end, you're accountible for your own wellbeing.\n2. Look into getting into counselling or therapy. CBT and ACT (acceptance and commitment therapy) worked for me so I recommend those. If you can't find certified professional help, try to look in to other resources. I highly recommend Russ Harris's book The Happiness Trap for example.\n3. On a side note to the previous one, be very mindful which sources you trust when looking into mental help advice. Self help is a huge market and there's a lot of misinformation and even malicious practices going around. This is why I highly recommend finding a certified professional.\n4. Recognize your assurance seeking \"autopilots\" such as going to the doctors, googling symptoms, reading and posting about your symptoms on forums such as this one, asking for advice, checking your body for symptoms etc and stop doing them. It might help if you keep a diary for a while.\n5. Learn how to distance yourself from your negative thoughts and emotions. Accept that it's a \"story\" that your mind is telling you. Not the truth. Acknowledge that in your mind: \"thanks for the story brain\", and move on. It may help if you imagine a funny character voicing your thoughts or emotions out (imagine Daffy Duck or Mr. Poopybutthole for example).\n6. Try to help others and focus on the happiness of the people around you. It will in progress make you happier.\n7. Try to find things to be grateful of every single day. It can be very simple and basic things. Even just \"I woke up today and I'm still breathing\" can be good enough for a bad day. Journaling can help a lot here too. Try to come up with at least three things every day that you're grateful of.\n8. Find a person you can trust and who is able to listen to your concerns and talk to them about it. Just talking to someone and having them listen (don't ask for advice or reassurance! Just for a listener) helps you process your thoughts. Remember that this person is not a therapist, so remember to be a good friend and listen to their worries too!\n9. Don't let your anxiety define you. You are more than your anxiety. You are a whole, awesome person with interests, dreams, achievements and so much more. Do things that you enjoy and try out new things. Try to live your life and be you as much as you can despite the fear and anxiety.\n10. The ultimate step for recovery for me was the acceptance that there will never be certainty. Look into the philosophy of stoicism. There are things you can do to improve your health and your chances of being healthy and you should take those steps, but in the end, there's always the unknown. Learn to accept things that are out of your control.\n11. When you notice new symptoms or things that worry you, unless it requires immediate attention (like acute care, emergency room type of care - you'll know when you need it), set it aside for a few days to a week and see if it passes. If not, re-evaluate your need of care. If your symptoms persist and the worry is not gone, it's ok to check it out with a professional. Don't google your symptoms or ask a friend.\n12. Try to accept that your struggle with anxiety is a journey and there's a purpose for all this. I'm not a spiritual person by any mean, but I believe that my anxiety manifested for a reason and there are good outcomes to all of this. I am more compassionate and grateful towards others. I completely revamped my lifestyle and lost a lot of extra weight as a result. I learned a lot about myself and how to deal with difficult thoughts and emotions. I can help others with the same problems I've had. I'm a stronger and more resiliient person than I ever was. Try to find the good in the bad.\n\nStay strong my sisters, brothers and other siblings :) If you need someone to talk to or more advice, hit me up with a PM and I'll see what I can do. Keep in mind though, I won't talk to you about your symptoms, nor can I make you better. Only you have the power to do that, even if you don't believe it yourself!",

I was ready to take some painkillers but it just lasted a couple of hours and resolved itself so I am feeling all okayy!! \nMy nurse was so kind and warned me ahead of time and said that all of it is normal and there is nothing to be scared of, so good luck to alll!\n\nUpdate after 3 days: idk if anyone still comes to this post but i know people who have HA will search vaccine in this subreddit to encourage themselves so here I am.

    "selftext": "My life has been really fucking shitty for the past 9 months or so. I had really bad anxiety attacks then (I’ve had anxiety my entire life but these were the worst attacks I’ve ever had), and that ended up forming into depression after fearing I would always be horribly anxious everyday. Combine that with constantly going on and off with nicotine withdrawal, and that’s where I was at. While I still deal with depression and anxiety, I really thought I had been steadily improving. This month felt like the best month for me in a long long time, and I still think that’s true. I’ve been having problems with my throat that makes talking hard in the past year and I finally went to an ENT specialist for it, and started treatment. My depression felt like it was dying down and my health anxiety was put to ease after the ENT appointment confirmed I didn’t have cancer or anything.\n\nAnd then today happened. I didn’t even know I had a doctors appointment today (check-up). I got there and like usual, everything seemed alright with me except for my heart rate and blood pressure. I’m 20 years old and have an anxiety attack practically every time I’m at the doctors office; my pulse was 139 while my BP was 141/99. I now have to monitor my blood pressure for the next month or so, get blood work done, and go back in a month. I was also up to 169 pounds today (was always around 150 during high school).\n\nI’m just so fucking tired of this. I just turned 20. I’ve been an athlete all of my life except for the past year dealing with these issues, and I was starting to get back into daily exercise (still am). I’m a smart kid, have money in my bank account despite not working (full time student). I feel like I’ve been doing things the best I can and yet I always end up back here. I’m just so tired.\n\nYou know what’s even worse? I’m not stupid and I’m not heartless. I know damn well people have it worse than me and that makes me feel guilty complaining like this. A kid I knew in high school developed leukemia and lived through hell for two years before having to ask his own mother to let him go... and here I am... complaining about my problems.\n\nAny encouraging words would be much appreciated. I’m just so exhausted... I’m 20 years old and I treated my body well for the first 18 years of my life, and while I haven’t treated it great in the past 2, most people I know my age treat theirs even worse and are fine. Now I’m sitting here with mental health problems and possible high blood pressure... at 20. It just feels so fucking unfair.",

    "selftext": "Anxiety sufferers tend to have a habit of wanting one thing. **Certainty.** Certainty that their symptoms aren’t malignant. When they get reassurances from their doctors, you know what they need? EVEN MORE CERTAINTY. It’s not their fault they’re dealing with this. *One thing about anxiety many people don’t realize is that anxiety’s job is to heighten the possibility that the most devastating option is the most likely one.*\n\nIf there is one phrase I hear constantly from people I help to help recover from anxiety/panic is “yeah but what if…” To be honest, it gets me frustrated. I also empathize because that phrase was part of my vocabulary when I dealt with anxiety and panic. It wasn’t till I found this hidden piece during my recovery, that I stopped using that phrase began making leaps and strides.\n\nNow this hidden piece, once revealed, will make repulse many people on this post. Hang in there, I promise it’s not what you think.\n\nThe missing piece…was faith.\n\nAnd no.\n\nI’m not referring to the faith in a higher power, religious faith, etc. I mean faith in the most fundamental sense.  **I mean faith in the ability to go into the unknown with the hope that everything will be okay.**\n\nAvoidance will only make your anxiety grow and become generalized (hence generalized anxiety). It's only when we go through the anxiety, does anxiety lose it's control and freedom becomes attainable.\n\nOnce I got the knowledge of the mechanics of anxiety and understood how anxiety tricks us into thinking we have some malignant disease. I made huge strides. But that itself was not enough. I needed to rely on the faith that everything was going to be okay in order for me to have the courage to face my anxiety and fully recover. I needed to rely on something when I started doing things that made me push my comfort zones.\n\nFor me, I had instilled faith on someone who had also suffered and recovered. He wasn’t a doctor, he wasn’t a therapist…but he understood how the mind worked. More importantly, this person knew how anxiety worked. He saw what I was suffering with, and helped me through full recovery. He made me do things that I didn’t feel confident in doing. But I had to instill some faith in the fact that things would get better. Otherwise I knew, for sure, I wouldn’t recover.\n\nI’m saying, recognize in your recovery…there will be moments you will need to have some faith. Regardless of what your mind is telling you. Relying on someone who is objective is very helpful in moments like these. Especially someone who has recovered. Also realize that this reliance on someone isn’t permanent. Eventually this faith will be transferred into confidence in yourself. Which in terms will lead to a upward spiral to recovery eventually.\n\nI don’t like posting nuanced posts like these because I feel like it can easily be misunderstood. But I couldn’t help post this info because it was just so valuable in my recovery and often so neglected.\n\nHope this helps.",

I just try to comment on posts to provide reassurance when I can, without asking for it in return. \nThe past several months have been absolute hell for me. Symptoms on symptoms on symptoms.. some psychosomatic, some very real. Multiple visits to my PCP turned into a referral to an endocrinologist, which ended up being unsuccessful in finding answers. I had a parathyroid issue back in 2018 that was resolved with surgery, but ever since then, any and every symptom has me losing my mind thinking that it is all connected somehow. (It was a benign tumor on my parathyroid, causing hyperparathyroidism). Let me just go ahead and say that I am doing everything in my power to treat my anxiety. Medicine, GeneSight testing, weekly therapy, yoga, self help books, you name it. \nAnyways- I have been completely fixated on my head and eyes the past couple months. I have pretty bad eye strain/dry eye accompanied by tension and sinus headaches. I tried everything to get rid of them, but they weren’t budging at all, and only getting worse. Around Christmas, I accepted my “fate” and came to terms with the fact that I absolutely, 100%, have a brain tumor. You could NOT convince me otherwise. All day every day, my thoughts were consumed with it. I haven’t been able to function at work, socially, physically, emotionally, etc. I completely lost my appetite due to the anxiety of it all, which resulted in weight loss, which scared me even more. \nFast forward to today- I got up and was nauseous as soon as I woke up. “Just another symptom of the brain tumor”, I thought. I pushed through and made it until about 10 am until I started getting super dizzy and nauseous at my desk. I could barely see straight or focus on anything. I couldn’t take it anymore and I got up and left (super out of character for me) and asked my mom to meet me at the emergency room. (I am terrified of hospitals. I have been one time in my life before today....emergency rooms terrify me). \nI got to the ER and only had to wait about 20 minutes to be seen. I told the doctor what was going on with my head and a few other things and she was incredibly kind and understanding. She immediately ordered a CT scan, loads of blood work, and a urinalysis. In my mind I was like “okay this is it. They are finally going to find it and I can start treatment and just get this show on the road.” I was terrified but I also felt this sense of relief knowing that I was about to have answers after all these months. \nA couple hours pass and I am a hot mess waiting for all my results. Finally, the doctor came in, looked at me with a smile and said “normal as can be!”\n ...... normal. Every single test, including the head CT, was completely normal. She walked through all my results with me. I cannot even explain the feeling that I experienced when she said that. Guess what else happened? The headache stopped. The nausea stopped. The dizziness stopped. It all just...stopped. My point is- health anxiety is REAL. The symptoms are so real. When you’re in the moment or going through a bad health anxiety flare up, there’s no way it can all just be “anxiety”... it HAS to be an underlying health issue, right? That’s what my mindset was. But I was so wrong... and I can venture to say that you are wrong about your scary symptoms too. If you have been checked out by a doctor and they assure you that you are healthy, BELIEVE THEM. They paid a ton of money and spent a lot of time to be able to correctly diagnose patients. \n\nP.S- this sub has been a lifesaver for me.",

    "selftext": "I’ve had health anxiety for maybe five years now, specifically heart-related. I haven’t had a panic attack in about a year, but I’m 36 weeks pregnant. Pregnancy and birth has always been a big fear of mine, and all the crazy new sensations have definitely been testing me so far. My biggest fear is getting pre-eclampsia (the major symptom being high blood pressure). \n\nI have major white coat and have had many a panic attacks from high blood pressure readings that included trips to the er and calling an ambulance (some of my lowest moments). I always knew if I got that high reading that it could trigger a panic attack, and also just thinking I could go into labor/be induced/emergency csection could trigger it as well.\n\nWell tonight I got a high blood pressure reading while testing at home. I did as my doctor directed and laid in bed in the dark deep breathing for about 30 mins and tested again. It did not go down. So far I was only slightly anxious, but like normal human without anxiety anxious. I called the on-call doctor at my hospital and she told me to come in. Normally that call would be the biggest trigger for me. Someone confirming my fear. I’ve had calls like that before and bam full on panic attack. But it didn’t come. \n\nI did start my deep breathing and had to distract myself from thinking tonight could be the night as my hubby and I packed our hospital bags in the car and headed out. When we got to the hospital , I asked to sit there for a bit in the car. I turned on one of my meditation songs, deep breathed, and told myself that things might get scary but it will all be okay. \n\nAfter that I was pretty go-with-the-flow-y and managed to not let anxiety get to me. My blood pressure did go down and they sent me home to be on bed rest just in case. But I did it guys!! I have been so worried about getting that high pressure reading this pregnancy but I didn’t panic!",

    "selftext": "Last year I was put on Wellbutrin for anxiety and depression which in the end of the week caused my very first panic attack, I had an intense brain zap/head tingle fit that scared me enough to think I was actually going to die right there in my room. All of that has made me very afraid of my health and that's where I started having more panic attacks, the typical heart scares and dozens of EKG's and tests. \n\nWhat's been bothering me the most in the past month is neurological damage, waking up smelling the ***same*** smell of burnt plastic, it wouldn't bother me so much at first until it lasted an hour, followed by a migraine and that elastic around the head feeling pressure headaches. \n\nSurprisingly, I don't feel like the migraines are as debilitating as this other sensation that's been pretty much daily since last month.. The best way I can describe it is like having pins and needles behind your scalp, running through the top of my head, and behind my eyes, it makes me feel as if my eyes are vibrating and they physically aren't, but it's driving me crazy, with the numbness in my fingers and the fear of MS or any other more common nerve damage disease. \n\nMore important things to note is I have an under active thyroid, my last tests came out normal and I take 125mg of euthyrox every day. I'm also getting a brain scan on the 16th next month and it's scaring me to think that all these physical feelings might be something more. \n\nI think it's hard because I don't know anyone who's just anxious and has felt these sensations that I describe, and every day I feel like it's getting worse and I feel insane, helpless, alone.. I don't want to go to the doctors anymore just to ignore what I'm feeling, since my appointment yesterday they just threw some Sertraline my way, and I really just hope all of this is anxiety.",

    "title": "How to overcome fear of ALS?",
    "selftext": "To me, ALS is the most terrifying disease in all of medicine that is relatively well known to the general public due to it being certain death with nothing anyone can do and being a particularly cruel way to die in how it locks you into your own body while you're fully aware before putting you out of your misery.  And things don't seem like they'll change anytime soon despite scientists' efforts.  I've always assumed ALS was very rare but with the publicity it's received and Wikipedia describing it as the the third most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, I've come to believe that it's more common than I thought.\n\nAs such, I constantly scan my body for symptoms of ALS and often convince myself that I have them and will die soon.  I haven't found any clinical weakness, which is good, but the problem is that the sites I read say things like hyperreflexia, the Hoffman sign and muscle fasciculations are associated with anxiety as well (which I obviously have).  It seems like a vicious  cycle where the more I worry about ALS, the more \"symptoms\" of it I have and the more I worry.  I should add that I'm in my 20s.  The internet makes it seem like just about any symptom affecting movement or the muscles (twitching, cramping, stiffness, weakness etc) not attributable to an obvious acute cause equals ALS, MS, brain cancer or some other serious neurological condition.  \n\nI also ended up on ALS forums reading too much about people's experiences with ALS.  I was particularly struck by cases of young people near my own age or in their 30s getting the disease (or seriously thinking they have it to the point of ending up in a neurologist's office) even though a [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5538408/) said that only 10% of ALS patients were under 45 at diagnosis.  Additionally, there are many people on forums who think they have ALS despite normal EMGs and exams from doctors.  For example, [this](https://www.medhelp.org/posts/Neurology/Tongue--Atrophy-emg/show/293053) patient thinks their *neurologist* doesn't understand ALS and [this](https://www.medhelp.org/posts/Amyotrophic-Lateral-Sclerosis-ALS/Clean-EMGs-but-progressive-issues-for-18-months/show/993999) patient still finds reasons to think they might have ALS despite being deemed not to by two neuromuscular specialists and 3 EMGs.  Can these people really be right and their doctors wrong?  I found out that benign fasciculation syndrome, or BFS, can mimick early ALS but I read someone in a forum saying that their doctor had seen more ALS than BFS making it seem like BFS is actually less common than the real thing while others sites say that BFS is common.  I've also read that ALS can present as just twitches and cramps for a while before weakness sets in while other sources say that weakness always accompanies or precedes twitching.  Finally, I've read multiple posts from patients who say they got a normal EMG at first before later being diagnosed with you-know-what.  I've gotten to the point where I've become hyper aware of my body and think that every little twitch of a muscle and every little ache is ALS.  I don't even have the level of twitching described on /r/bfs and would have thought nothing of it in the past.  I first experienced this fear in my teens before it when into remission for some years.  Back then, I was just afraid of getting ALS, now it's a more classic hypochondria.  How do I get back to not living life in constant fear?",

    "selftext": "Im no expert and I know everyone is different but I’ve come a long way with my health anxiety and wanted to share a little of what I learned.  \n(On mobile, excuse format and typos)\n\nI once read something along the lines of “our brain believes everything we tell it, so if we start filling it with doubt and anxiety, we create a world that is simply not true” \n\nA year ago and I was telling myself every little symptom meant imminent death, I worried about brain cancer, breast cancer, blood cloths, etc etc etc. \n\nIm still in the process of completely desensitize myself from the most minimal sensations and Im still trying to learn how to really understand what my body is trying to tell me, this is kind of how I learned to deal with it (again, I know not everyone is the same but hopefully this will be useful for someone) \n\n1. If I can distract myself from the sensation or discomfort then its anxiety, I call them “sensations” because any little thing I feel I wanna convince myself is pain even if its not. I try to ignore it if thats the case. My doctor always told me small sensations or symptoms are not a sign of anything serious.\n\n2. If its interrupting your day to day then take something for your symptom and try to move on, (eg., you have a sore throat then get something specifically for that) \n\n3. If over the counter meds don’t do it and its well over a week or so then I’ll call my Doctor explain whats going on and see if I can come in for some answers and peace of mind. \n\nIf you have multiple terrible symptoms then of course go check with your doctor asap. But the main thing is, breathe friend. Don’t freak out immediately, don’t google about it, try to accept the thought and the sensations as exactly that, thoughts and sensations and nothing more, they’re not a sign of anything. \nYou won’t heal your mind in a day but in time things will get better.\n\nIronically, life is not guaranteed for anybody no matter what, but looking for symptoms constantly means you’re wasting something you want to hold on to so desperately. \n\nThink about that, I do it everyday.

So, so stupid. \n\nI (22F) went to my OBGYN today for a checkup after switching birth control pills 3 months ago because of high blood pressure and, of course, I get extremely anxious every time I have to get it taken. I can’t pinpoint why I’m scared of it exactly, but it’s been high every time I’ve gone to the doctor for the past couple of years (around when my health anxiety started) and I think that’s made me really anxious about it, on top of my anxiety of even setting foot in the doctors office to begin with.\n\nSo of course it was VERY high today (160 over 103), and I began freaking out and crying as soon as I was taken back (I was already holding back tears to begin with). My doctor came in a little confused, but talked to me and just asked that I take my BP at the grocery store or pharmacy a couple of times within the next few weeks and send her the results. \n\nI’m embarrassed for crying of course, but I’m also embarrassed for not being able to calm down when getting my BP taken. My heart races every single time and I try my best to breathe slowly, but it seems like that only makes it worse. It makes me feel like a child and that the nurses think of me as one too. I’m scared because I don’t want high blood pressure (as nobody does). I never thought that somebody my age would deal with it, and I’m absolutely dreading having to get it taken again. \n\nI don’t really know what to do. My doctor obviously recommended therapy which I’ve been considering, but I’m worried about the cost and having to tell my family that I want to go. I’m also scared that my BP will be high again when I go get it done myself, and that I’ll just have to see more doctors where I might get diagnosed with something (which is my worst fear). \n\nI just feel humiliated and insanely scared.",

I will admit, the first few times I tried his method I couldn't do it and I felt like it would never work, but after trying it about 10 times I finally had a breakthrough and I had one time where I managed to stop worrying, I felt better, and it came back.

I worried daily, hourly, over every ache, twinge, and tingle. I had chest pain, arm and leg tingles, headaches, etc. My worries jumped from this to that over what it could mean. \n\nA post on here really resonated with me and helped me get over the last hurdle to being free of HA (finally!). It was a doctor's advice - something along the lines of: is it persistant? Is it worsening? Is it severe? \n\nI had multiple tests done (blood tests, x-ray, samples, ultrasounds), that seemingly cleared me of anything serious. But still wasn't convinced. These simple questions helped me work through my HA, sifting through the symptoms that were most likely anxiety related:\n\n* Was it persistant? No, my symptoms often disappeared when I was with family, friends, or distracted doing something I enjoyed (music, art, exercise, etc). Only reappeared when I remembered them.\n* Was it worsening? No, it would tend to come and go, and/or change into something else.\n* Was it severe? No, it was generally mild and nothing that could stop me from doing daily tasks.\n\nBefore calling a doctor, sit with those questions for a day or two, or even a week or two and see what happens. Personally, when armed with these questions and healthy distractions, nearly everything disappeared with time.\n\nI hope this helps someone like it did for me!\n\nEdit: Thank you for the gold!! 💓",

    "selftext": "Lymphoma was my most recent obsession until I went and saw my doctor today. He gave me some good advice/facts that I thought I would share with those of y’all who are mentally diagnosing yourselves with lymphoma like I was for the past 6 weeks: \n\n1) Sometimes you can have a lymph node that just DOESN’T go down in size after an illness. About 6 months ago, I got a nasty cold virus that caused a node in my neck to swell like crazy. It went down afterwards, but not to a small, undetectable size like the one on the other side of my neck. This node has been the driving force behind my anxiety for a while now, so hearing this really helped. He said it would probably just remain that size and there’s nothing to be concerned about. It did its job by helping fight the virus, and then got as small as it could afterwards. No big deal.\n\n2) He told me it’s okay when my lymph nodes swell for no reason—as long as they get smaller, there’s no reason for concern. A huge trigger for me is finding a randomly swollen one when I KNOW I feel fine, but now I know it’s just my body working as it’s supposed to. It’s fighting something, and maybe it will do a good enough job that I’ll never even feel sick! Apparently, the real concern comes when one swells, and swells, and continues to swell for weeks with no decrease in size (and by “real concern”, he just meant that they’d wanna do imaging. It could still have other explanations that don’t lead straight to lymphoma).\n\n3) Your preauricular nodes can swell due to acne flare ups! Who knew? (I’m assuming other nodes can swell for this reason, but he specifically mentioned these)\n\nAgain, this is just what MY doctor shared with me, so obviously go see yours if you’re feeling sick/bothered by a lymph node. \n\nI personally come to this sub to calm my fears and learn more about why I’m experiencing certain symptoms, so hopefully what I learned today can help calm someone who’s freaking out and 100% convinced they’re dying of Lymphoma.

After moving on from that I thought I'd become a serial killer's victim. Since then I've thought I had a couple other diseases and even Ebola. \n\nIn December brain fog hit me and I've been self-diagnosing with anything and everything. Right now (in my head) I'm allergic to everything under the sun including the sun. \n\nThe point I'm getting at is, if there's a pattern or history of health anxiety or general feelings of unsafety, it's important to recognize that. It might help you snap out of your bout of health anxiety. \"But it's real this time!\" It was real then too. You weren't carefree and easygoing when out of the blue you started experiencing symptoms. You've *always* been hypersensitive to sensations, anxious, and catastrophic in your thinking. \n\nAnother thing to note: If something is *seriously* wrong with you, it gets worse and worse over time.

    "selftext": "# Long post but i hope it helps\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you look at my posts going back, i was freaking about a whole host of symptoms 5-6 months ago. While i am not totally free of all of the symptoms I am in a much better state than before and I always used to think that when i get better I'll write about it.  So this is my attempt to give something back.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere is the list of symptoms I had\n\n1. Twitching (still have it sometimes)\n2. Internal shaking - the feeling that your whole body is shaking when you wake up\n3. waking up with my heart racing\n4. hand tremors\n5. body pain\n6. muscle tightness\n7. Shaky vision\n8. Not able to sleep through the night ( I used to wake up every 2-3 hours)\n9. Fast heart rate even by going for a short walk\n10. a weird feeling of my pulse everywhere\n11. pin pricks\n12. cold spots (sometimes still get it when i am stressed)\n13. tingling\n14. a warm flush feeling at times\n15. Feeling of water dripping down on my legs and so on\n\nThis is the list i remember off hand and i am sure if i think even more I'll remember the other symptoms. I also went through the entire gamut of ranging from MS to ALS and was freaking out. I visited a number of doctors and all the blood tests and physicals came back normal. I was really scared and frustrated and frequented this forum a lot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy google searching took me a site **aboutbfs** where all the symptoms seemed to match it. But even reading through the forums i found no joy since it seemed like people suffered from \"BFS\"  for the rest of their life and I didnt want that. That said, I found some success stories which all raised an emphasis that if you reduce your stress over  a period of time, your symptoms will abate and eventually go away. Unwilling to suffer from these symptoms all the time, **i took the following steps which have helped me a lot**\n\n1. I totally **stopped Googling** my symptoms - I really cant emphasise this enough. Stop reading up on your symptoms\n2. **Stop going to medical forums**. You will always find something which matches to your symptoms and you will wonder if you are that unique case\n3. Stay away from forums like aboutbfs and the facebook groups about it. Even though BFS is benign, lot of people get caught up in it and stress out even more and they never recover\n4. **Meditate** \\- Honestly, i can't stress this enough, this has helped me so much. There are several meditation options available such Headspace (app with a subscription), Insight timer (my favorite meditation app and its free !!) and the honest guys on youtube. Honestly find something that works for you and do it.\n5. **Get a hobby**:  I took up learning spanish since i always wanted to learn a new language and took up digital painting. I also started working on a blog post called [living in the united states](http://www.livingintheunitedstates.com/) (feel free to visit it but no pressure)\n6. Seriously **stop self testing yourself or strength testing**. I know this can be hard and i tend to do it sometimes but by constantly reassuring yourself you are just maintaining the worry cycle.\n7. Smile :) and laugh. Watch some good comedy shows. Do something with someone that makes you laugh.\n8. **A website which was of great help to me** was the [anxietycentre](https://www.anxietycentre.com/) website. I was initially suspicious that it was a scam but after i took the plunge and signed up for their 6 month membership, i found a lot of information which taught me how anxiety and stress can cause all the crazy symptoms we worry about. It also taught me some valuable tools in how I can beat my stress and calm my nervous system down. They do offer counselling but I never took it. (**Important**: I have no affiliation with this website, but it was super instrumental in setting me on the path of recovery)\n9. **Trust your doctors** \\- I know this is hard but **honestly your 2 months of googling doesn't make you an expert**. If you need to get a second or third opinion do it but stop right there. Don't go and get 20 opinions.\n10. **Give it time** \\- When your nervous system is hyperstimulated so much that you are getting all these weird symptoms, its going to take time to relax it. **Don't expect success in 2 days, 2 weeks or 2 months**..think more like 6 months - for example, i am still recovering but i am getting there. Also our normal tendency is to go back to our bad habits of worrying and stressing our bodies out once our symptoms abate which is what we need to avoid. So doing the steps you need to take to calm your nervous system is a long term process. Also as time goes by, you will realize you are just fine :)\n\nAll the best. I know if i can beat this, you can too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFeel free to ask me any questions. I'll try to respond when i get a chance.",

It first started when I found a bit of blood in my stool after constipation and a lot of pain, which I now know it was most definitely a tear. Not knowing that at the time, I made the horrible horrible mistake of googling what it could mean. I got fixated on the possibility it could be CC, and I spoke to everyone in the family about it and got about the same answer; it's nothing, no family history, don't worry about it. So I didn't, for a time.\n\nNothing happened through mid December, but around December 15 or so, I started having some stomach pain right behind my belly button, a dullish pain and a feeling of being bloated when the pain stopped. Naturally, I connected the prior event and this one as symptoms of CC, and the wonderfully vague symptom of \"abdominal discomfort\" I had remembered from when I googled it. I got worried that I might have it, or have to get a colonoscopy to confirm if I don't. \n\nThis pain continued until right at Christmas, when I stopped taking my ADHD medication. During the week where I stopped taking it, I had nothing at all. No pain, everything normal. When vacation ends and I start taking my medicine again, the pain returns. \n\nI finally gave in and had an appointment with my doctor about it, and he said it was just anxiety and nothing to worry about, as CC wouldn't just go away, it would be constant. The pain went away for a few days and then came back, and it's been back now since about January 10th, along with this slight feeling of bloat. I should probably note that all my bowel movements have been completely normal since, aside from me not knowing that tomato shows up in the stool as red and almost having a heart attack. \n\n\nI'm sorry that this is a very long ramble, I've just honestly had not much of anyone to talk/vent to about this. I keep telling myself \"it's nothing, stop being stupid\" but I start thinking of the horror stories of 20 year olds getting CC and I get right back into the loop.

There’s probably lots of you who go for runs/walks when you’re anxious, including myself, and most of the time it works wonders. Other than a distraction, the scenery and just moving your body, there’s actually some psychology behind why it’s so helpful. As everyone knows our perceived threat triggers our flight or fight response trying to keep us protected, which then causes all the terrible symptoms and feelings anxiety comes along with. By walking or running, it tricks our brain into thinking that we are running away from the perceived threat, and eases the anxiety. So if you can, go for a walk!

    "selftext": "Listen, most of us who have anxiety have done the whole being scared of what something could be and looking up all the different things it could be. Well, the truth is and I think we all atleast deep down know this it's making our anxiety worse. Not just that, but once you start seeing your symptoms for one thing and you start looking that like certain thing up you can start to believe you are suffering from those other symptoms too only leading you further down the rabbit hole. So, here's a little advice if you are afraid that something is going on with you. First assess the situation\n1. Are you breathing?\n2. Are you talking? \n3. Are you fine enough to search your symptoms and maybe write a post about it on Reddit? \nIf you answered yes to any of these you are most likely not in any immediate danger. So, calm down for the moment and just breathe. If you are truly afraid about one thing then schedule an appointment to see a doctor. Just know though that chances are you think seeing that doctor and getting clarity will help, but most likely you'll just believe there is something else wrong with you. The best thing you can do for yourself is live in the moment or at least try. Instead of looking at symptoms go out and take a walk or do some work. You could also try doing 15 minutes or so of guided meditation. Try to be productive and I bet you will start to forget about that little thing that was bothering you.",

In the UK the health system is frustrating slow so I thought I'd try to work out what was wrong with me myself. \n\nLong story short - guessed it was muscular as sleeping was fine and sitting around fine. \n\nDid some reverse kegels to realx pelvic floor and some yoga for a couple of days.\n\nBasically I was constantly tensing my lower abs (probably due to increased urination due to increased anxiety). I worked it out by just standing up and consciously relaxing my core. I felt my lower abs release, then I felt them tensing again so relaxed them again. Did that yesterday and now im 95% better. Now and again I just have to consciously relax those muscles as I feel the urge slowly returning. Another way to describe it is imagine you are desperately holding on to a wee (without actually holding on to a wee) then let it go. Would advise doing it knowing your bladder is empty just in case🤣 hope you manage to understand and hope it might help someone.\n\nThis worked for me.

    "title": "My complete recovery story",
    "selftext": "Hello, I felt that I had to share the way I got completely recovered from health anxiety, in case it might be helpful for someone else. The solution was simple yet I hardly saw it being mentioned during my days of constantly googling. Maybe because it isn't intuitive at first glance.\n\nFirst, a bit of context. My worst and last episode lasted for a couple of months continuously and happened a couple of years ago in my mid-twenties. You can skip this paragraph if you don't want to read symptoms, but basically I started with constant internal trembling and as days passed I had almost every imaginable symptoms: A lot of chest pain, sometimes to the point I was certain I would have a heart attack; jelly legs, it was impossible to walk a block or two, doing groceries was a nightmare if I ever dared to get out of home; constant dizziness, sometimes I woke up and got so dizzy I couldn't get out of bed and spent many days bedridden; eyesight issues, every possible muscular tension, constant fear, constant paranoia that I had this or that desease, constant googling, breathing issues... you name it.\n\nDuring this time, I tried everything as well. Every possible combination of inhaling and exhaling in breathing exercises, \"grounding\", \"mindfulness\", counting 5 things you can see, 4 you can touch and blah blah; taking pills, drinking specific teas... Of course going to ER and being told I was ok, only to feel terrible a couple of minutes later. Until I found a solution posted by another guy on a FB group.\n\n**I'll try to explain my solution the best way I can**:\n\n**First, you have to be aware of what is going on**. This is the way that I was explained, the way I understood it and the way it worked for me.\n\n* **Forget about the cause**. Disregard the origin of your health anxiety. It doesn't matter if it started because of a traumatic incident, or because of continuous stressful situations, or because you have a lot of responsibilities, etc. It doesn't matter and you don't have to dwell on it to get rid of the anxiety. The process would be the same.\n* You need to **accept** this understanding. Has it happened to you that you were just there, not really paying attention, and someone scared you from behind? At the moment you feel a lot of sudden fear. What did you to get back to your normal state? Think about it. The answer is... **You did nothing. Really.** You did nothing to stop being scared. Once you understood you were not in danger, you did nothing, yet you recovered. Seriously. Did you say \"I'll activate normal mode now!\"? No. You just let your body release the fear, the stress, and quickly but gradually came back to normal.\n* **Health anxiety is the same, it just takes longer**. No matter the symptom, it is present because your body is dealing with releasing accumulated stress. For some reason your body got a lot of stress, it manifested as some symptom, then you worried and feared it and in doing so you added more stress, and your body needs to release it again and it manifests symptoms again, creating a never ending cycle. The more you worry, the more you google symptoms, the more you read material about this, the more you pay attention.... the more stress you add for your body to release later. So how do you stop the cycle?\n* **Abandon the battle**. It sounds paradoxical, but in order to win the battle against health anxiety you have to let go of the battle. By doing so, you won't add more stress, and your body will be able to release the existing one, until you are recovered. That's it. But you might wonder, what am I supposed to do when I feel the symptoms? Do these:\n\n1. **Take care, but don't care**. When you feel a symptom, take care of it, but don't do it with the expectation of making it go away, just to simply do the best for you at the moment. Say you feel dizzy on the street. Take care of it, by for example resting for a bit, laying on a bench, whatever, but don't expect that by doing so, it will go away. **Because there's nothing you do that can cure yourself, only your body can cure itself.** There's just no single action that will make you get cured; but you don't need to act, your body will take care of it and you trust it. So you are just taking care of your symptoms but you are aware that it's just stress being released by your body. Let go of control, because you don't have control to begin with. But your body has control, so trust it. Delete the responsibility of healing to your body. You do nothing.\n2. **Reduce importance**. This might sound extreme but it helped me a lot. I stopped wishing to feel better. I stopped putting pressure on myself that I had to get better. I removed the burden that I had that I needed to be healthy, recovered. I even removed myself from the need to be alive. I appreciated the time I was alive, the human experiences good or bad that I had. I accepted that even if I died that day or my symptoms were actually coming from a real desease, I would be ok with it. And I really was. I accepted my human experience had to end at some point, and released the need to feel well or even be alive. I appreciate each instant I was alive despite of my stupid symptoms, I appreciated the chance I had that very moment to tell my parent or a friend that I loved them, even appreciated that I had the possibility to drink a warm tea in my bed. I completely surrendered. Yet deep down I keep the knowledge that my natural state was to be alive and healthy, and that the most probable scenario was that I was gonna be fine in a matter of days.\n\nSo, that's it. Since the day I was given this explanation, I started living in a way that felt detached from my symptoms, basically assuming I was already healthy, despite feeling my symptoms. To give a rough timeline, the first two days I felt 80% of the previous intensity and was sure this was going to work. One week later I was like 20%, and two weeks later I felt fully recovered, even though some muscles were still a little weak from so much tension. A month after that, I was just enjoying life and couldn't even remember what was like to feel health anxiety.",

    "title": "PSA: HA and OCD are very similar issues. Since treating my anxiety like a symptom of OCD and NOT like a symptom of normal anxiety, I've noticed incredible progress.",
    "selftext": "The most helpful resources about OCD  I found are from Dr. Michael Greenberg.  He has a few very short and simple articles about OCD, but they are **the** most helpful thing I've read for my health anxiety.  I can't stress that you should read them even if you just have minor health anxiety, as they may help you.  [https://drmichaeljgreenberg.com/articles/](https://drmichaeljgreenberg.com/articles/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for my story, I'm meeting with a new therapist and finally admitting to myself that I may actually suffer from mild/moderate OCD.  It runs in my family, I always knew I had tendencies, but I always was too ashamed to admit that it actually was a huge part of my anxieties as well.\n\nThe problem with OCD is that you see it portrayed in the media as quirkiness, being obsessed with order, etc.  That's actually just a very small subset of OCD.  There's so many more \"versions\" of OCD that no one talks about, and because of that, people don't realize it's OCD unless they're washing their hands/turning light switches.\n\nI had a relatively real health scare recently.  Was diagnosed with EoE and Chronic gastritis.  Is it something I need to be aware of and take care of?  Yes.  Did it necessitate me spending weeks and weeks googling every symptom, looking at my own poop, calling all my friends that are nurses, losing sleep, not eating, etc.?  \n\n\nNo.  \n\n\nNo matter what I did, though, I couldn't calm my fear down.  I kept trying to find some smidgen of evidence that would put me at ease.  The problem was that even when I found the piece of information I wanted, my brain would immediately discredit it and try to find something else.  I was chasing the dragon, and never getting to where I wanted to be.  \n\n\nOver the ups and downs of the last few months, I started to really notice similarities between my emotions and anxieties, and that of someone with OCD.  I read article after article, not about my health, but about OCD.  I felt understood, and heard, for the first time.  Turns out health anxiety is a form of OCD, just as the person who washes their hands frequently, or has to close and reopen doors constantly.  It's just that the routines and the compulsions are *mental* and not physical.  I had no idea that was a thing.\n\nYou might have OCD if your health anxiety does the following:\n\nYou could be watching TV, not focused on anything else, out of nowhere you get a thought.  \n\n\n\"Oh wait, I never checked out that bump on my leg\"\n\nYou *immediately* feel a wave of panic, you start sweating, you feel cold.  You feel like the world is ending, like your seconds from death.  It sounds stupid now, but in the moment it feels so incredibly real.  \n\nThis is your intrusive thought.  \n\n\nYour next response is to check the lump.  Push it.  Prod it.  Shine a flashlight on it.  Look at it in different mirrors.\n\nThis is a compulsion.\n\nIt's not enough, your fear is getting worse.  You hop onto your phone and start frantically googling. \"Lump on leg\" \"signs of skin cancer\"  \"lump on leg serious?\" \"symptoms of bone cancer\" \"Symptoms of hypo-thyroidism\" etc. etc.\n\nThis is another compulsion.\n\nEventually you're exhausted.  Your spent.  The adrenaline is gone and you're just scared and anxious.  You slowly recover and try to live your life again.  Only to have the entire cycle repeat.\n\nJust like the person who touched a door knob and needs to wash their hands endlessly.  You are hit with an anxious thought and need to \"cleanse\" your anxiety by finding evidence that will tell you you're ok.  However, just like with the hand washer, just once isn't enough.  Your brain requires more and more and more until your hands are bleeding or your mind is a mess.\n\nThis is OCD, and the sooner you start treating your HA like this, the better.  I promise.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have so much more to say, but I think the articles I listed above will be far more helpful.  I'm also more than happy to add more or answer any questions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBe well, friends.  You're going to be ok.",

The less focus you give it, the less alarm bells will go off in your mind. When they do go off, remind yourself \"this is just anxiety. I am okay, my body is okay\" and then move on to something else to focus on. That acknowledgement is the first step to getting better.\n\nWe need to **-trust-** that our bodies can take care of themselves. If something feels really wrong we **DO NOT** google it, we make an appointment and calmly go to get a checkup and then trust the doctor, get a second opinion if you *absolutely must.* Your body is a highly functional machine and is not going to randomly shut down. If a problem persists, go get it checked out. However, most of the time the symptoms will disappear as soon as we get focused on something else (exercise, a book, conversation, cooking, cuddling, sex, etc.)\n\nThe mind loves to saturate itself in negative thoughts, it takes work to challenge and change those thoughts!\n\nSo many people have terrible health issues and recover just fine and live good lives. \n\nHyperfousing on what *could* happen prevents us from living well and healthily - which is what we all want, to be healthy and live well. \n\nI also find it useful to acknowledge what I am afraid of - I'm not scared of *dying* - eternal sleep sounds pleasant. \n\nI'm afraid of **not living well and not living up to my potential.**\n\nI have dreams, goals and ambitions and I want to live to see them, and I don't want to suffer or be struck down. That is so normal and human. This also means that you have things in your life that you value, things worth living for. \nI can plan for the best and be prepared for the worst without giving in to false alarms. It's part of the balancing act of a mature, emotionally stable and healthy life.\n\nSo instead of living in fear of what *could* happen I'm going to try to live my best right now. Which means not googling, not focusing on illness etc., but focusing on wellness instead. \n\nI thank my body for everything it does for me, and tell my brain to stfu, haha.\n\nWhat will you do to focus on the positive and shift your mindset?",

Typed this on the phone so please excuse the typos. \n\nEDIT 2: The annual \"physical\" exam is actually a blanket term I used because it included a whole lot of other tests apart from the actual physical like a blood test, checking blood pressure, xray, and urinalysis. The Xray was for the chest area. I had it immediately before the actual physical exam with the doctor. The physical included the basic check of the eyes, ears, if there are any lumps where there aren't supposed to be lumps, etc. \n\nSo, yeah. This took a turn. My company sponsors an annual physical exam and the moment I walked in the clinic, it was like I was dropped in the ocean. When I found out that an xray is part of the physical exam, the nerves kicked into high gear and made me think about finding spots or a tumor in my lungs. Thinking about it worsened my anxiety, which made me experience shortness of breath, which just made my lung cancer anxiety worse. When I got to the bit where the doctor was looking inside my ears, she suddenly said with a bit of trepidation, \"uhhh... Did you know you there is an insect in your left ear?\" I was like WAT. The bug (it is dead) is most likely a small roach who decided to make a bachelor pad out of my ear canal. Unfortunately the EMT specialist is out for the day so I was not able to get rid of it today (I will come back tomorrow). My cancer related health anxiety literally disappeared in an instant because now I am faced with an actual problem. The anxiety still comes back in waves, but it is not the same strength as before now that my mind is more occupied with this new issue. I guess this is the universe telling me that hey, you can stop thinking you have cancer because you have an actual problem here.",

I posted it as a comment a few weeks ago, but I thought it might reach/help more people as its own post. It seems relevant to some recent posts on this sub. I'll post the url in the comments, but here it is:\n\n\n\n\"We all worry about our health from time to time, at least to some degree, but some people worry excessively about catastrophic consequences of seemingly benign symptoms. They’re known as hypochondriacs.\n\nThis is the sort of process hypochondriacs go through: what’s that? A benign lump or malignant bump on your face, breast or rump? Adrenaline rush, heart pumping, sweating, and light-headedness follow, confirming the gravity of the terminal self-diagnosis.\n\nThoughts racing and images of a foreshortened future, orphaned children, and opportunities missed. Overwhelming distress. Must plan the epitaph – see, I told you I was sick!\n\nOur future and physical health are inherently uncertain. But people with hypochondriasis immediately resolve any uncertainty about novel physical sensations and symptoms on the side of catastrophe.\n\nThe body is constantly in a state of flux. The heart pumps, blood flows, muscles twitch, lungs inflate, and bowels contract. Strange symptoms come and go. And most pass without conscious awareness as we focus on daily tasks.\n\nBut try this. Hold your hand upwards, so that your palm and fingertips face the sky. Focus all your attention on the tips of your fingers and wait …and wait …until you notice some sensations. Tingling, temperature changes, or just an awareness of the sensations on your skin.\n\nHere’s an even simpler task. As you read this, shift your attention on to the sensations of the ground or chair pushing up against your body. Chances are you were unaware of all these sensations just moments ago.\n\nAttention, you see, is the microscope of the mind. It can filter in or out any of your internal or external experiences.\n\nNow imagine becoming hypervigilant to all the physical changes naturally occurring in your body. Try it. Just focus on all the sensations in your body for a minute. Amazing, isn’t it? Itchy toes, tense jaw, mild headache, numbness, and so on. All the normal workings of a healthy body.\n\nPeople with somatic symptom disorder are experts at searching for and noticing normal bodily changes. They’re also experts at interpreting these in potentially catastrophic ways – fatigue is leukemia; a lump on the arm is cancer.\n\nThe number one enemy of someone with the disorder is Dr Google (“cyberchondria”). Indeed, the only thing more catastrophically creative than a hypochondriac’s mind is Google’s 2.42 million webpages on the causes of cancer. Every possible symptom can be linked to every possible diagnosis, by at least one disreputable source or another.\n\nThe hypochondriac is searching not for information, but for confirmation of their imminent demise. If they’re unlucky, they might come across contradictory information or additional ailments they hadn’t yet considered.\nTheir intense worry and anxiety feel intolerable and must be neutralised. Seeking out a sympathetic doctor or other source of reassurance, or avoiding the health section of the newspaper all provide temporary relief until the next physical symptom is perceived.\n\nSo what are some things that keep hypochondriacs worrying?\n\nBelief: worrying will help me catch something early.\n\nNo, it won’t. Worrying will just keep you miserable until you’re old enough to find out how you will shuffle off this mortal coil (unless, of course, your demise is a blissfully brief surprise). Worry itself will not get you any closer to predicting, preventing, or planning for your death.\n\nBelief: I can get certainty about my health.\n\nNope, can’t get that either. No amount of checking, doctor visits, Googling, reassurance-seeking will guarantee with 100% certainty that you’re well. I can, however, guarantee that the unrelenting pursuit of certainty will make you miserable.\n\nSo, how can you manage health anxiety?\nFirst, develop some healthy guidelines for monitoring your health and stick to them.\nBased on your past experience, how long do benign symptoms typically last? One day, two days, one week? Decide how long you will wait before seeking any form of certainty or reassurance (from the internet, friends, family, or medical practitioners) the next time you notice a symptom, especially ones you’ve worried about in the past. Once this time expires (no pun intended), make a decision about whether you need to get the symptom checked or whether you can wait another little while before doing so. Follow guidelines from reputable sources about the recommended frequency of body checking.\n\nAnd, be willing to sit with uncertainty about your health. None of us ever have certainty about our health. I could have a brain tumour as I write these words. I am willing to accept this possibility and shift my attention onto the next paragraph.\n\nThink about it this way: if I offered you a $2 million insurance policy for your house, even if I promised to build you a gold-plated replacement if it were destroyed, you would likely consider it far too expensive.\n\nSo, how much are you willing to pay to prevent any possibility of illness? Are you willing to give up your capacity to work, time you would otherwise spend with friends and family, and ultimately your happiness? This is a very high price to pay.\n\nSpend energy on things you truly value, rather than wasting it on a false insurance policy. Learn to accept uncertainty about your health. Revel in not knowing when or how the end will come. Focus instead on the time between now and then.\n\nUltimately, what you have to decide is which epitaph you would prefer when your inevitable end arrives: “lived decades in misery and fear of death”, or “didn’t see that coming but my life was far richer for it.”",

    "selftext": "After nearly a year of panic-induced Googling and r/HealthAnxiety scouring, countless unnecessary doctor's visits, eight months of counselling, and my first month of anxiety meds, I'm finally starting to feel like myself again.\n\nLast fall, I experienced, what I believe to be, my first full-blown panic attack. There was nothing overly stressful happening in my life at the time and the intense physical effects that came with it had me 100% convinced that something was extremely wrong with my body. During the following months, I felt on-and-off tingling throughout my body, near-constant headaches, more trips to the bathroom than I could even attempt to keep track of, and a very counterproductive amount of time online. \n\nEvery trip to a doctor or to a blood lab left me feeling like they were somehow missing my very obvious, very critical condition. The fear I held onto the most was that I was diabetic. Despite multiple blood work results telling me otherwise, I was convinced. I bought a blood sugar tester and began obsessively monitoring my sugar levels. To no surprise, my levels were normal. I would always feel some sense of relief, but it never lasted. It was like I wanted them to be abnormal so that I could hang onto some tangible reason for why I felt the way I did.\n\nAfter about three months of this, I finally began to entertain the idea that anxiety was at the root of what I was going through. I've been going to counselling about once a month for the past eight months and doing short meditation exercises at least a few times a week. I was amazed by how much I had improved; I was still aware of the odd ways I was feeling, but they felt like more of an annoyance than the intense fear they had been. After six months of this, I went on a three-week vacation (that had been planned before any of this) and forced myself to leave the blood sugar tester at home. It was a rough several days at first, but I soon realized that what I thought was helping me feel in control was really just making things worse.\n\nWhen I got back, I fell into some of the same patterns I had formed before the trip. I started testing my blood regularly again, checking my urine with home test strips (gross, I know,) and checking in with Dr. Google every day or two. This time, however, I recognized that what I was doing was anxiety-driven and not helping my situation. I made an appointment with my family doctor and with my counsellor and made the decision to start taking anxiety medication.\n\nA month later, and I'm starting to feel in control again. I don't feel totally \"normal\" again, nor did I really expect to. That same tingling sensation comes up from time to time, but it doesn't send me into the slump it once did. I think I finally understand that just because I'm not *feeling* anxious, doesn't mean anxiety isn't there.\n\n I've still got a ways to go, but I'm really hopeful for the future.\n\n**TL;DR,** it gets better.",

    "title": "Update on brain tumor anxiety.",
    "selftext": "So about a month ago I posted on here my fear and dread of possibly having a brain tumor. One day I woke up with a headache that just never went away. Started to develop some other odd symptoms along with it; vision, cognitive, concentration issues, phantom smells that would hit me out of nowhere, nausea, feeling like my balance was off, to name a few. \n\nMy anxiety eventually landed me in the ER where I was given a CT scan. Normal. No sign of any mass or lesion. The doc said physically I appeared fine. But the headaches didn't go away, and my increased thirst for an answer persisted. \n\nAfter meeting with my GP I was referred to a neurologist. I was finally starting to get somewhere. The neuro decided to put me on some meds, and if the headaches didn't let up in 5 days, it's MRI time. And of course, they didn't. So the search continued. \n\nYesterday was my MRI. I went in hopeful but terrified. I have spent the past month exhausting myself, convinced that my days were numbered. That I for sure had something growing in my brain that was on a path of destruction. The imagination is a strange beast, especially when it comes to health anxiety. \n\nI got the call this afternoon from my neuro. For a split second I didn't even want to answer the phone. Because I knew there was a good chance he could have some news that was about to change me for the rest of my life. So I took a deep breath and answered. \n\nThe MRI scan of my brain came back normal. Thank God. \n\nThe moral of my little story here is how gripping anxiety and worry can be. Especially in the technology age. We have so much information at our finger tips, perhaps too much at times, that we can so easily misdiagnose ourselves and fall down a rabbit hole of disease and death. For awhile there I was convinced that I was going to die from a brain tumor. Convinced!\n\nIn closing, I still don't know what it is that is causing the headaches. Maybe it's poor diet. Or maybe it's something else. But I can tell you as soon as I heard the good news, it felt like the headaches almost disappeared. If you spend enough time focusing your thoughts and energy on something, it will make whatever is hurting you 10x worse. I do think it is important to listen to your body, and get checked out when things persist. But what I've gathered is that it is important to expect the best and stay positive. Worrying will get you no where. Thanks for listening and to good health! \n\n",

    "selftext": "[Trigger Warning:]….although I feel every thread here is triggering slightly. Lol. \n      I had a breast mammogram and ultrasound 6 months ago. It turned out that I had benign cysts but they noticed one of my armpit lymph nodes being swollen. It never concerned me because 10 years ago I ended up in the ER with a panic attack worried about that lymph node, but they told me it was fine. It’s been there ever since. It gets smaller and then gets bigger like once a month. Today I had my follow up ultrasound and I found out some things I didn’t know about swollen lymph nodes. 1.) If you have a lot of tattoos, like I do, or even just one near a lymph node, you are more likely to get swollen lymph nodes. The radiologist said tattoo ink gets lodged in lymph nodes and calcifies. It often shows up on mammograms and ultrasounds when people have arm and chest tattoos! \n2.) if you were born a woman and have a menstrual cycle, your lymph nodes can swell during PMS because your lymphatic system is in overdrive. \n3.) a lot of lymph nodes don’t ever go back to normal after an infection. I had read this before but the radiologist said that it happens way more than they say on the internet. \n\nI didn’t know any of these things. For the last 6 months I had convinced myself I had some form of cancer hiding in there. I hope this helps someone. Still “when in doubt, get checked out” for a peace of mind.",
