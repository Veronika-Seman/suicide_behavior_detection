    "selftext": "\nI understand NHS mental health services are swamped and overwhelmed. I am considerate of this fact and tell health professionals not to worry if they apologise for delays etc. However it’s been consistent that when I return calls to inform the duty team I missed a call and I’m aware someone wants to ask about something it reaches a dead end. I’ve also duty as advised if things got worse or i need to inform them about anything. \n\nDespite finding it incredibly difficult to pick up the phone on my own accord because I’m worried about myself, I do try to chase this up. With missed calls I do it the once, let them know I received a call and know someone is asking about something. \n\nI’ve been under this team since autumn 2023. Here are some examples as to why I’m starting to think this is a problem:\n\nA quick telephone checkup on my welfare wasn’t logged. Then the team was ringing my old phone my number that couldn’t be reached and called the police for a welfare check.\n\nI was prescribed new medication that I was hesitant to take, but didn’t feel able to raise this with the psychiatrist during the appointment. I called informing that due to a history of OD’ing on meds that cause drowsiness I don’t feel safe having those meds around. Again wasn’t logged, wasn’t communicated and my psychiatrist asked me why I didn’t inform the team.\n\nI was psychically assaulted, I called the team several times because I didn’t feel safe from my own self and others. I did manage after calling several days in a row to speak to someone and  overtly stating I don’t feel safe. My phone battery ran out so the call cut off, I called back they said the person I was talking to will call back. They didn’t and I couldn’t be bothered to chase this up. Again not noted or logged.\n\nI would really appreciate an outside perspective on this. Because I really don’t want to kick up a fuss. I know that if a friend of mine told me this I would tell them to raise it up, but knowing me It will take a lot of debate in my mind whether this is within reason to bring up.  \n\nThanks in advance for any comment \n\n\n\nOn a more personal note:  (TW self harm/suicide)\n\nI struggle immensely to care for myself, to express concern for myself. I often feel like I’m being bothersome, or attention seeking to pick up the phone is a lot for me. 2 or so years ago I was in  a 8 month bizarre self destructive rut where I was in and out of A&E, people calling police out of concern.  I still feel embarrassed about this. And around 2 years ago I have stopped seeking any medical attention when I really ought to have sought it.\n\nIt’s difficult, incredibly difficult to pick up the phone and state I’m not ok. When I was assaulted I nearly caused significant irreversible harm. It was the concerned frazzled looks of two elderly women on bikes stoped me because I didn’t want them to see what I thought is wanted to do.\n\nI told no one apart from a woman from Samaritans when I came back to the place I ran away. This was in July 2024 and I still haven’t told anyone because of the judgements I have placed on myself. I know this is likely not the case but not hearing back for me feels like  it’s reinforcing the idea that I am indeed being burdensome or should figure things on my own. ",

I try to be open and honest about how I’m feeling, what’s impacting me, but it’s difficult. \n\nAnd I’d try changing GPs, except this happens with every one of them. I experience it with counsellors too. \n\nIt isn’t sexual/romantic but more so a parental authority figure who I’m scared of disappointing, so I agree to things I know might be of little help and try to be a “good” patient by not advocating for myself, being compliant, over-compensating with explanations as to why things failed. It also interferes with any prospect of future physical examinations due to shame. \n\nBut he’s an attentive GP, even if he doesn’t specialise in mental health, and actually - at least for the most part - is okay with my requests to see face to face as he understands I struggle with communication. He gives me time to think, doesn’t rush me, and actually listens when I have issues. Perhaps this is because he’s a relatively new GP, I’m not sure, but I also want this continuity of care because it’s exhausting rehashing it out again and again. \n\nBut I don’t want to confide in it because I’m scared it’ll creep him out etc, even if they are taught how to deal with transference. I’m also feeling so much shame, too, as it’s a fairly taboo thing. \n\n",

Yay for uber level masking skills. \n\nlast year i was invovled in a fatal diving incident which has seriously affected my coping stratagies and my base mental health. \n\nthere was no support given at the time by the police despite multiple claims that they would assist me in getting help.  the victim support unit lead with \" we dont know why we are talking to you your not the victim of a crime\" . when i found and recovered a body for them. \n\nI do not medicate at all for this due to historical issues with medication. this is an informed decision i have made due to serious side effects.  \n\n\n\nbefore chrismas last year my MH took a very serious nose dive, and suicidal ident became an almost constant thing and after mentally crashing i sought help from the GP. who refused to take things seriously. \n\nthe mental crashing is identical in nature to prior occasions when i attempted to take my own life. \n\nafter literally breaking down on a call with a3rd party non MH NHS advisor they engaged safeguarding procedures and another GP was informed who refered me to the local MH team.  \n\nduring this time i was at best finding the situation hysterical almost farcale. and woudl devole into giggling fits and extremly inapropriate comeents. along with being unable to struture a sentance in other formats. \n\nand after a 2 month wait i had an assessment with the core MH team and after 2 hours of going over untreated history, and the fatality and the multiple effects of this i was given no access to MH support,\n\ni was instead sent  and told  to find councling and a single providr they recomended.  this is NOT free. this is a product i would have to pay for and i am not in a position where i can actually find the funds for that , \n\nafter speaking to the gp today i was basically told. Yeah tough shit piss off and find help yourself. . \n\n\n\nand i dont have anywhere to turn. i dont know how much fight i have left in me this time and i dont know how to actualy get into the system to get the help i know i need . \n\n\n\n  ",

The one issue I foresee is that I have not had CBTI. I do not believe it’s available in my area but have also been told that as the insomnia is a symptom of GAD and MDD, CBTI is unlikely to be that effective.\n\nI know it’s also possible to get this medication through telemedicine companies but you need a diagnosis of insomnia on your medical records which, despite many appointments regarding insomnia, I don’t have for some reason.

    "selftext": "Hi, I would appreciate any advice and recommendations on private inpatient options. A family member in their mid forties is currently in crisis, their local NHS mental health crisis team is on the case but so far has not decided that they merit inpatient care on the NHS. The MH team will review again tomorrow but if their decision does not change then it will be necessary to find private care (wider family will be able to fund this).\n\nThe situation is complicated (isn't it always...) but essentially even if my family member does not pass the bar for NHS impatient care tomorrow , they cannot go home as they are currently unable to care for themselves and their own home is not currently habitable. They have been staying with a friend who has now asked them to leave, and other family members are not able to accommodate them meaning that they are out of options omdor anywhere to stay. In any case they need urgent help from professionals..My family member is exhausted with chronic sleep disturbance, manic, malnutrition with ED elements, and suffering from delusions which have started to lead to alarming although not strictly harmful behaviour (unfortunately the delusions may not have been shared with NHS team, the family member does not accept that they are delusional, is resistant to help and can be very convincing and lucid when they want to be). My family member has joint custody of young children  but in this crisis phase is not able to safely care for them. However I am working on the assumption that it will be a good idea for residential care to be somewhere near the children as well as near wider family who could visit, and this means that London, Birmingham or the Welsh Borders (e.g. Shropshire, Herefordshire) could all be possible locations.\n\nWider family need to find a solution quickly. An initial web search has thrown up The Priory, The Nightingale, and a large number of care homes which say they offer mental health support but look more like old people's homes not set up for crisis support. We really need somewhere that has more of a rest and respite kind of vibe and caters to younger people (something like the Priory I guess) because my family member who doesn't acknowledge half of their problems will need to be persuaded to sign in.\n\nI will really, really appreciate any recommendations.\n\nCan I also add that I fully appreciate how lucky it is that in this situation wider family can potentially cover the cost of what is needed, if we can find it. This seems so hard already, my mind boggles at what happens I'm a scenario like this if the NHS doesn't help and there is no self-fund option.\n\nMany thanks in advance.",

There was a situation out of my control that lead to me loosing custody of my children. I was waiting on an oporation and was struggling. It was a short term situation that was 'solved' by removing my children until they are 18. Part of this was social services coming into my home and very harshly judging my home, i.e breakfast things from that day not washed up by 10am and sitting in the sink things like that. Please don't comment on this I have only included it as it is relevant to today's problems \n\nNow I'm 35 and live on my own.

I have sought help with NHS but only get 6weeks at a time then have to wait 3m to rerefer then start again with someone else. I also work full time upto 80hrs a week which means my days off are spent recovering. I don't have any family around and my friends don't live close. The only friends I have close by are from work and we work shift work so meeting up outside of work is difficult and happens maybe a few times a year. 8 can't work less hours as that would mean I don't have enough money to live on and I don't qualify for PIP (I've tried) \n\nSince 2014 I have developed such a fear of letting people into my home that I keep being threatened with eviction as I put off having to let the letting agency in to do things such as inspections or gas safety check ect. I know that alot of the anxiety is because of my chronic illness and work pattern I find it difficult to keep on top of chores and I feel I am going to be judged harshly again. I also know part of it is because it's a loss of control and the fact I don't get a choice in these things happening \n\nDeep down I know I need to do this but the anxiety is so great and overwhelming and I don't know how to 'get over it's so I can do these 'simple' tasks \n\nIf anyone has any advice or if anyone has been in a similar situation I would love to hear from you \n\nTia ",

    "selftext": "Currently 17, turning 18 in June. Been suffering from depression/anxiety symptoms for a few years. I went to my GP a couple of weeks ago, who referred me to CAMHS. In a follow-up appointment with my GP today I found that CAMHS rejected me because of the wait time and my age. They told me to self-refer to my local IAPT services, with whom I've now booked a telephone assessment on Friday. They emailed me a preliminary questionnaire which included a PHQ-9 and a GAD-7. It didn't tell me my scores specifically but I recognised the tests and calculated I got 23 in the PHQ-9 and 19 in the GAD-7. The way I've felt recently to get me those scores is the exact same I've felt over the last couple of years. I've tried so many things, including working on my nutrition/sleeping, accessing online services like Childline/Kooth, and regularly speaking to my school pastoral team and friends. I never have the energy/motivation to pursue the physical changes long-term to see the results no matter how much I try, and speaking out doesn't make anything feel different, maybe just even worse because now other people know how wrecked I am. \n\nI'm going to go to the IAPT sessions with an open mind because I can't reject something without giving it a chance but I doubt it will do much, if anything. I want to go on fluoxetine because I have my A-Levels in the summer and I have offers from some seriously good universities which will honestly change my life and help me get away from the situation that's mainly been causing my emotions if I get in. But the entry requirements they have on my A-levels are sky high and I won't be able to get in if this is how I feel. I've just had my mock exams and they've been unbelievably shit, I wasn't even able to do half of the papers because I couldn't focus. I could go on and on about further reasons why I think it would be beneficial in my case but my point is, is there even a chance for me to get a prescription because of my age and the rejection from CAMHS? I don't have any idea what IAPT can do for me on this. I understand it's very restricted in under 18s because of risk of suicidal ideation (for which I scored 0 on the PHQ-9) but I'm almost 17 anyway. And I don't want to start the medication too close to my A-levels because dealing with side-effects for the first time during my exams could really mess things up. Sorry for how unnecessarily long this was, I just don't know any other way to convey all this. I'd really appreciate any advice, be it on who I can ask about this or what I might be able to do in this situation. ",

Had CBT on the NHS but in all honesty found it to be borderline insulting. The therapist encourages me to 'sit with my feelings' on a daily basis. To ask myself what I am feeling and why, and just 'sit with them'. They say its ok to feel that way. They also ask me to reframe my thoughts, try to understand that I am being unrealistic or unfair on myself. They have also asked me to try to be kind to myself, show myself compassion. Which is all fine and as far as I know within expectations for these issues.\n \nI am struggling to really do this in any effective way. If I drill down on my mental state and sit with those base emotions (disgust, embarrassment, shame, fear) it literally just makes me feel even worse. It doesn’t give me any relief. I feel like that all the time and try to gloss over them. Identifying that I feel scared or ashamed and sitting with it makes me feel worse, not better. I just think what a loser.\n\nThe related issue about reframing and kindness I am even further adrift with. If I try to reassure myself or say, don't worry about it or whatever else, I just simply don't believe it. I have a well attuned ear for rubbish, so when I try to tell myself that its ok, your doing well, etc I know that isn’t true, any objective assessment would tell you otherwise.\n\nHow do I take myself serious and be kind, when I have no belief in that internal voice.\n \nI'm also awaiting assessment for autism, so not sure if that feeds into it.

    "selftext": "I have been on 14 medications (4 of which were for ADHD) and nothing has helped. I am extremely depressed, riddled with severe anxiety and avoidance behaviour, I have autism and ADHD, and I am floating between passively and actively suicidal. I've also tried multiple types of therapy (talk therapy, CBT, integrative therapy, art therapy, hypnotherapy) with different therapists for long periods of time without any help. Have been suicidal since about 10, am now 24 (M).\n\nI'm on the NHS conveyor belt but we all know that's useless, so I wont even talk about that for now. Been waiting since July for therapy still ahaha.\n\nAnyway, my mum was able to save up a load of money over a long period of time for me to see a very reputable psychiatrist who was able to help my sister a lot a few years ago. It was extremely expensive, as you can see, and I am very lucky to have parents supporting and caring enough to help me with this, even if they themselves haven't got much money.\n\n\nTDLR: after an hour of talking he just said that, because I'd tried so much and it hadn't worked, there was no point of carrying on doing trial and error and he said I should do a genetic test with a company called GenoMind to figure out how my brain interacts w/ various chemicals to figure out what medication is best for me. It costs £800-£900 apparently, and I cannot afford that whatsoever, nor will I be able to afford it for the foreseeable future. I can't even get a job right now, and even if I did, it'd be a low wage job in which I wouldn't be able to save up that sort of money for a long time.\n\nHe then just put me on a medication I've already been on twice that didn't work (Mirtazapine) and brushed me off/gave a non-answer when I asked why that one in particular. \n\nLiterally nothing I wrote in the form before the meeting nor the conversation we had in the meeting seemed to have any particular influence on the outcome/treatment recommendation other than the number of medications I'd taken in the past, and I feel like the whole thing could've just been sorted out in an email without me having to spend so much fucking money. That could've been half-way to the GenoMind test!\n\nAnd that was it. £450 just to be told to spend an extra £900 and put on something I know doesn't work. Great. Thanks for that.\n\nOfc I'm not saying he's wrong, but I don't think I needed to spend £450 to hear it, and it is very presumptive to assume I can afford to splash out almost a grand just on a whim (he was talking as if I could just do this immediately). Plus, I don't even know how good this GenoMind stuff is. It isn't approved by any formal medical bodies (FDA, NICE, etc) from what I can tell, how good really is it? He says a lot of his patients have been helped by it which I believe ofc, but when I look at the demo on the website it's hard for me to really tell how much it could help. What I am really scared of is that it'll just tell me that the best medication for me is one I've already been on that didn't work, or that none at all are good for me. At that point, I'd have wasted £1350 instead of just £450.\n\nI don't have that money even theoretically, but even if I did, I'd be scared of spending that much because of the reasons mentioned above.\n\nWith that in mind, I am officially out of hope. Even a psychiatrist at the top of their field has basically no clue what to do with me, nor does anyone else I've seen. It's pretty obvious to me that my prognosis is extremely poor and that I will never be anything but miserable and severely mentally ill. My view is that, if we lived in a just society, I would be given access to assisted dying for incurable + unbearable suffering. I give up, just like everybody else has given up on me. It's hopeless. What is the point. I am just stuck here because I don't want to make my parents and partner sad at this point, I'm ready to give up. I tried my best, it's over.\n\nThe only thing left is rTMS which costs about £8000 per tranche of treatment (often requiring multiple treatments) which is insane and I will never be able to afford it. It's not on the NHS where I live. So I'll never be able to even try that, sadly.",

I had another appointment with a GP but nothing new came of it. \n\nI have no hopes nor dreams, there is nothing keeping me alive other than the fact that my death would inconvenience others. I will always have to work full time just to be able to survive, but being alive causes me nothing but suffering, and working full time drains me from every milligram of energy i have. I tried therapy so many times and it never did shit for me. I tried 6 different antidepressants and they never did shit for me. my life currently exists only to perform my \"duty\" as a cog in the capitalistic machine. in 2 weeks my sick leave will end and i will have to go back to work and i will have what? a week? 2 weeks? before i become severely suicidal again? and what then? i will go to the gp and get another sick note? clearly there is nothing that can actually help me ",

He was diagnosed with a thyroid issue last year and has been put on medication for this, since being on this thyroid medication he has really struggled with his bipolar (in the same way that he did before they diagnosed it). \n\nIn his last down period, he was suicidal (sorry if this is triggering for anyone), very angry, unable to handle his emotions and he was also experiencing hallucinations and felt terrible day to day. \n\nHe went to the doctors and explained that he feels his medication needs reviewing. The doctor said his thyroid medication is fine so they would refer him to the mental health hospital. \n\nHe was seen by a man initially, who said he definitely thinks he had a bipolar episode and agreed his medication needs reviewing. He stated that the psychiatrist makes the final decision, so everything my dad discussed with the man was written down for her review. \n\nWhen my dad met the psychiatrist she told him she believes he has BPD. I don’t feel this is correct as someone who lives with him and has knowledge of his medical history. \n\n- She told him how she thought he felt, when he disagreed with her and her conclusions she’d drawn, she disregarded him \n\n- She told him that his medication is working perfectly fine and doesn’t need adjusting? When he said he doesn’t feel right and would like something to change, she said no. \n\n- She gave him a questionnaire type sheet to answer, he said he didn’t feel confident selecting answers because is the quiz referring to his high or low periods. She said ‘answer it to the best of your ability’. \n\nUltimately, she’s offered him no solution and I’m very worried for anyone she has treated in the way. Psychiatrists shouldn’t be disagreeing with people’s feeling or experiences, at the very least. \n\nWhat can I do! Where do I complain?

Realistically I'm not going to do anything though. I just feel hopeless about all I have going on and that I have no support. I don't know though if calling 111 is wasting resources when Im not going to attempt most likely because I will eventually go to bed later but I also don't want to just sit here on my own in all these feelings. There's no one I can really talk to in my life about what I have going on",

He says if they think further therapy is needed I’ll be put back on the waiting list. Even though he supports me getting further help I know it isn’t his decision so I am a bit scared I’ll be dropped. \n\nIf they do decide to help me further what would that look like? More CBT?

Took me 11 try’s in school to get my English and I still don’t have my maths , I stayed on in school to get my English and a levels . I have an HND in Game design and Bachelors with honours in animation now I’m studying my masters in animation . \n\nA few months back I got promoted to supervisor in the hotel that I work for which is great but I’m 0hrs which is hilarious ,it’s great for my degree but not great at the same time ( toxic work environment ) I consider my self to be a workaholic and now I’m finding life to be so overwhelming . I failed one of my assignments over Christmas I had forgotten when the deadline was because I was working so much so I pulled an all-nighter the night before and submitted 6hrs before the deadline because I had work 7am that morning now I’m hoping that I passed the second assignment with at least a 58% for me to pass the overall module . \n\nI’m still waiting on marks to be released and I just want to cry all of the time and give up because in my bachelors I never failed any of my assignments, I know I’m being hard on myself but I have to be because I need the money but I also want this degree . I have the chance to resit the module In the summer but that just adds to my overall stress . Before my second assignment was due I ended up in a&e with my declining health , I asked my course coordinator for an exstention the week before this happened and he never replied to me  . I have my up and downs with this guy in lessons even last year . I forgot the clavicle in the rig and he told me I need to go back to biology I found it funny and giggled but he didn’t find it very funny . He wasn’t even one of my lectures last year just a helper that goes round to help with 3d problems now he’s my course coordinator lol . With the first assignments feedback that I failed in he mentioned about me arriving late and leaving early some days mind you the days this happened the next days I would be in I would stay later to catch up . So I told him about my declining health , doctors appointments he goes for future reference tell this to your lecture as she will be teaching you the rest of the semester . I’m also depressed and riddled with anxiety I have been off my depression tablets this past year but still take meds for my anxiety , I told my lecturer about my medical history and that I also had a mental health mentor last year to help me out . Honestly if it wasn’t for this lecturer following up my message to the course coordinator I would have been done for . \n\nI’m contemplating on whether or not just to drop the course .\n\nThe title probably isnt the best description more how can I lessen my sense of impending doom towards life 😂",

I’ve been struggling for a long time (about 10-15 years when I look back) but making that phone call to book an appointment was too difficult for me and something I could just put off. By making the appointment in person when I was already there meant I had to go through with it and I’m glad I’ve done it, but as it’s tomorrow I’ve unfortunately got too much time to ruminate and worry.\n\nI did self-refer to the talking therapies service middle of last year, but of course there’s a very long waiting list. They identified significant issues across the anxiety, depression and PTSD assessments but we identified trauma and PTSD as the main thing I wanted to focus on first.\n\nUnfortunately I’ve been really struggling in the meantime and if I’m honest, I could really do with some support whether that’s medication or just regular check ins or some other form of therapy in the interval before I’m called for my sessions with talking therapies.\n\nSorry for all the waffle, essentially, I find talking about my mental health very difficult and so I’d like to know from people who’ve done it before, what is that first appointment like? Is it all symptom based? More questionnaires? Particularly as I’m not sure exactly what I’m dealing with exactly - I personally think there are multiple things going on at the same time rather than it being just one or the other, and I believe ptsd is only part of it. In fact, I find it difficult to say I have ptsd at all due to how it manifests symptom-wise being less clear cut than the examples used in the awareness and education course I did with talking therapies.\n\nTL;DR: first gp appointment tomorrow. How does that tend to work? What do you discuss and who leads the discussion? (I expect this differs on an individual level, but any help would be appreciated!)",

    "selftext": "hi loves, probably a relatively long post im sorry!\n\nive had some of the worst few months of my life (after quite a turbulent and traumatic life already) in terms of trauma and functioning (i have ADHD which may be audhd, depression and anxiety diagnosed currently) and also study psychology so i have been doing a lot of research and reading into how ive been feeling and whats gone on. ive always had a feeling on and off that i would fit the criteria for BPD, symptoms particularly manifesting in a relationship or with a favourite person. i know that bpd can be a culmination of various traumas stemming from childhood which i can definitely relate to due to experiencing early childhood sexual assault, neglectful / unavailable parents, and other struggles hand in hand with being entirely undiagnosed until my early 20s, plus traumatic experiences going on into adulthood. \n\n^ (this is where i am also struggling to decipher between bpd and cptsd) \n\ni struggle with a lot of aspects of general daily functioning such as self care, food, routine, sleep and health in general. this has always been the case due to longevity of mental health issues and various traumatic experiences but over the last few months and even weeks, i can see this is far worse. \n\nmy partner and i have been going through the worst of our lives the last few months after his disclosure of some very intense things, including betrayal to me, his childhood trauma, neurodivergence, the way his brain works and his poor mental state etc and both of our lives have pretty much stopped as a result. \n\ni also experienced what i can only imagine to be bpd rage? \non the whole i am the complete opposite of a violent person but during the turmoil of the last few months i have found myself being extremely angry and needing to feel some sort of impact to calm down. i have a history of self harm but prior to these events i had been clean for around 4 years. the rage episodes started with throwing objects or hitting things (furniture, walls, hard things etc) or sort of throwing myself against something, but then heightened as time went on and the trauma was unfolding and i began to harm myself, and even at times when things were the worst i eventually ended up being violent towards my partner. at these times, in the worst cases, its like i black out and dont remember how i got to the point of harm. \ni’ve experienced anger with blackout sort of feelings before but not this bad. like if in an argument or even an intense conversation with someone i can often forget what was said or what happened. i have a lot of memory issues too and dont remember some aspects of certain traumas, or much of my childhood at all in general. \nanother main struggle i have is that i am painfully empathetic and self aware which whilst it can be helpful, makes situations like this debilitating. \n\nwith these explanations and with how my life currently looks i know i need help quite soon as my entire life has frozen and i am barely functioning and just feel traumatised and broken every day. i also feel like a terrible person for reacting to my partner in the way i did at times, even if it was reactive, i cannot comprehend being a person who hurts others especially physically. \n\nthe point of my post i guess really is because im wondering how people who have been through the process of approaching a GP (NHS wise) and explaining all of this to them as from what i have heard and read, the nhs services arent too receptive of those struggling with BPD? \n\ni am very bad at reaching out to services as ive been failed by them before, and i also have largely isolated myself the last few months am currently receiving no mental health support at all other than an ADHD service providing my medication, and i have read elsewhere online that with a bpd diagnosis you become blacklisted from many nhs therapies, any many doctors dont treat us very nicely or provide us with much help? as a result of my current situation i am also in extreme financial difficulty as my partner and i have both been unable to work since, meaning that i am completely unable to access private support and need nhs help quite soon. will a bpd diagnosis hinder this further for me? \n\ni was wondering also whether people with similar feelings or experiences have considered or deciphered between bpd and cptsd? \n\nthank you for reading sorry for the length, first post too! :)\n\n",

(not actively suicidal, just have the thoughts.) so right now im doing talking therapy on the NHS, and ive had 2 or 3 sessions i can't remember. the first one was me explaining a bit about my situation and stuff and then after that we moved onto looking at situations where the therapist can give me coping strategies. the issue though is that i dont feel like physical coping strategies are what im looking for, and we didnt even cover the thoughts side, only the physical. i know ive still got some sessions to come, but therapy feels stupid because i cant ever describe how im feeling. i can never find the words and i say one thing but its not a proper representation of how i feel so its hard for my therapist to understand. sometimes it feels like she is trying to catch me out, like when we were talking about how long the problem has been going on i was finding it hard to remember because it feels like its been going on for years, but i told her colleague in the assessment one thing and her another and she questioned me about it and it felt really nitpicky lol like i had just committed a crime which for someone with anxiety was a bit of an over the top reaction but thats by the by. now im struggling with doing therapy, and its a phone call one too because im too anxious to actually go but.. i dont know it feels really odd and stupid and i hate talking about my feelings because like i say i cant ever find the words to describe it. i feel like im at a loss now. she said they usually do about 6 sessions so they only treat shorter term problems but id argue mine is a bit of a longer term one. i also forgot to add that im a transgender male, therefore there is definitely a contribution from that in terms of dysphoria and i guess body image type of stuff, and that can't really be classed as a short term issue so i dont really know what to do. i've thought about maybe medication to take the strain off the anxiety maybe until i feel more able to be less anxious talking about how i feel, or to make me feel less like shit 24/7, but because i'm 17 i dont think my gp would agree and im too anxious to ask incase im rejected then im embarrassed 😭 i dont really know the purpose of this post and sorry its so long, i guess im just looking for advice maybe or support? thanks for reading anyways if you got this far🙂",

I got a call from TT to let me know that she went on a somewhat planned leave way sooner than anticipated, and they unsure how long it’ll be. This happens to me so often that it’s almost a comedy of sorts. \n\nTo be fair, they gave me the option of waiting for her return or having a new therapist. I chose to wait for my therapist’s return as I’ve already had quite a few sessions with her and I don’t want to have to do that with somebody new. I can’t have anyone in the meantime as it means I’d have a new therapist for the rest of my sessions. What if I don’t like them? What if they’re not helpful. Familiarity is best. I’m quite glad that in the last few months, I’ve not been nearly as unwell as I was two years ago or even at the start of 2024, but this would’ve been a perfect time to really dive deep and work to some kind of recovery or a better baseline in my mental health. \n\nI’m not mad at all whenever they leave as they’re human too and whatever issues they’re dealing with have to be super impactful to their lives and general wellbeing. I just think it’s almost satirical that I’ve worked so hard to even start therapy after five years and when I start to make progress, I’m stuck again. I’ve always thought about going private but I feel it’s something I’d only be able to afford kind of short term and not as regularly as I’d need. \n\nThanks for reading this far, just a rant of sorts here!

    "selftext": "About a year and a half ago I went through a severe mental health crisis. I couldn't sleep, was hearing voices,paranoid and also felt uncontrollable. It was the first time I had ever gone through something as well that intense. \nI went to my university psychological service,The welfare team, my GP, mental health nurse provided by GP,my personal tutor and the disability services,CHMT for help but either was dismissed or told I was too much. At times some services were useful but would end up coming late or couldn't help me as much.Over time my symptoms worsened and I ended up having a psychotic break that lasted over for the remaining of the year.\n\n\nI feel guilt because it hurt my relationships alot. I feel guilt that one day,at 3pm I felt I couldn't trust myself yet it didn't occur for me to call 999 but rather to tell my ex who was honestly overwhelmed by things. I feel guilt that I didn't advocate for myself when I told the nurse that I feel uncontrollable and everything is distorted and she didn't really do anything. I should have  gone to a and e ,realised the severity of everything and been able to step back and got the help I needed. If only that one day,that one second I knew something was wrong I got my bag and went to a and e, things would have been OK.But I didn't, I think I spoke to someone I'm not sure my memory is hazy.\n\nI feel guilt because I overburdened my friends, my ex and so on.I was really erratic,one minute happy then depressed,One minute aware and the next really deluded,saying weird things and I think the hardest part to reconcille with is the fact i was pushing people away.I stopped uni,fled from work and became isolated. I couldn't even do my washing. I feel guilt that when the gp doctor told me to go to a cafe and relax, I didn't instead advocate for myself more. I feel guilty that when the nurse left the practice I didn't push for who would take over my case.I feel guilt that when the pharmacist changed my meds so quickly  i didn't question anything but just took them even though my mum advised me not to because I was so desperate to function.I feel guilty that its taken me a whole year to come out of crisis and realise the severity of things. I feel shame, actually not even guilt. The people in my life went through alot and then having to deal with me and my crisis?That's alot and I feel heartbroken by the pain I've caused them and those I lost. I'm angry at myself. Why did I not go to a and e?Why didn't It occur for me to go? What was H supposed to do? Why didn't I realise that I was in a severe crisis? Why wasn't I aware that my mental health was getting to a really bad state that might need more than just the help I was getting?these questions flood my head.I eventually was taken to a and e when I attempted and am getting help more than before but it's like I've tried all my life to be a good person and now I've failed at that.I hurt others and that's not ok. That day at 3pm i took a step back could have led things to go another way but I didn't. When H took a step back because of their mental health, why couldn't I realise that I needed a step back too atp?I knew something felt off yet I kept going.\n\n\nI feel like i didn't do enough to help myself and rather unknowingly made my friends feel responsible which was alot for them to handle. \nI get flashbacks of everything and it's alot. I know some people just say leave it it's in the past but for me it feels like it's happening over and over again everyday. ",

    "selftext": "Firstly, some people may have been around for previous posts I made while I was unwell, and I wanted to both thank everyone for all the advice and support that was offered and apologise for any concern/worry/negative feelings etc I may have caused. \n\nSecondly, I have quite a long and difficult MH history and I’m trying to keep this short-ish, so please feel free to ask for more context/details if necessary. \n\nUp until last Jan, I was on lamotrigine, quetiapine, and mirtazipine. I quit them cold turkey due to delusional beliefs and spent most of last year in what I can now understand/recognise was psychosis. I was sectioned in June and, while hospitalised, trialled on around 5 different meds, mostly forcibly as I was mostly non-compliant. I was discharged from hospital last Sept on olanzapine and, as soon as I saw the locum psych at my CMHT, I requested to be switched back to quetiapine due to the weight gain side effects I was experiencing with a view to eventually re-introducing the other meds as well. This was delayed by me a) restarting my ADHD meds and b) the locum psych leaving the post the same week I saw him (frustrating on many levels as he also validated the diagnosis I agree with and pushed for re-assessment of the one I don’t). \n\nI eventually got back onto quetiapine around Nov and am on a “standard therapeutic dose”. When I last saw my CC, I talked again about wanting to restart lamotrigine and mirtazepine as this is the combo I felt most sable on and have been on the longest. Bearing in mind that my CC doesn’t have prescribing abilities and that I’d still be on these meds if I hadn’t gone off them solo, I was told that it wouldn’t happen as there’s “no clinical indication”. Whilst I recognise that I’m somewhat stable at the moment, I’d like to keep it that way rather than having to experience another crisis for meds to resume. My CC eventually said they’d speak to the new psych (who is permanent and I haven’t met yet), but I’m not hopefully given the response from my CC and historical difficulties in our relationship. \n\nA complicating factor is that my discharge report mentioned “discussion that [I] was consciously feigning symptoms due to inconsistent presentation”. It doesn’t say anything further and my request to access my notes was denied. This, along with previous experiences, leads me to believe that any future support I seek/need will not be forthcoming as it will be assumed that I am making it up for whatever reason. Firstly, I didn’t fake anything and genuinely thought I was absolutely fine and behaving completely normally. Secondly I don’t know how anyone *could* fake what I was experiencing or why they would want to. \n\nI’m aware that not everyone needs more than one med to be stable and maybe it is the case for me too, I’m just afraid of going downhill again and even then not being offered support if they think I’m making things up anyway which, for clarity’s sake, I’ve never done. Is there anything I can do or say to encourage/convince my team to re-prescribe meds that I believe were previously helpful?\n\nTLDR - CC said no to restarting previous meds, pretty sure the general thinking is that everything I do/say is fake meaning I’m unlikely to ever be taken seriously again, if I ever was. Really want to stable but don’t know what I can do. ",

My sister, who used to work for my CMHT came with me and agreed on the diagnosis and I thought that was the end of it and I would finally receive appropriate support for my condition. This was 3 years ago, and I’m still being pushed from pillar to post with no treatment plan in sight. \n\nMy sister actually left my CMHT to join a better one because she couldn’t stand how far behind and incompetent this team is.

I’m very high functioning autistic, I have all the skills in place I developed myself to manage my autism and it truly isn’t an issue for me. But since the autism\nDiagnosis all of my issues have been blamed on my autism. I went through horrific sexual, emotional and physical abuse as a child which resulted in my PD, but now they refuse to acknowledge any of my trauma or mental health issues all together. They even tried taking me off my life saving antipsychotic because “there’s no medication for autism so you don’t need it.” \n\n Every single issue I have they blame on my autism when all of it is absolutely linked to my trauma and PD but they’re now telling me I’m just a depressed autistic nothing else. \n\nThey have told me point blank “we have no treatment pathways for personality disorder, if you had something like bipolar or schizophrenia we would know what to do but there’s nothing we can do for you.” My sister backed this up, she was actually PD lead for another service after working at my CMHT because she couldn’t stand the lack of care, we are one of the most underfunded constituencies and 10 years behind in treatment. The other day I saw a man yelling at the front desk “you tell me I have personality disorder, then you tell me you can’t do anything about it and I can’t go anywhere else!” I feel his pain, no one here is trained in it .

    "selftext": "I’ll try to keep this as short and salient as possible — brevity isn’t my strong point. \n\n44 M, cisgender, straight, married, autistic. \n\nSpring 2020: Telephone consultation with GP about always feeling on edge, being reactive, and constantly hypervigilant — prescribed sertraline. 25mg to begin. \n\nAutumn 2021: Major meltdown and burnout — at first I think it’s a series of panic attacks, but after a while, I realize I’m autistic. Sertraline has increased to 100 or maybe 150 by this time, after several further tel cons with GP to discuss my stress, feeling reactive, constantly worried, and not sleeping. I also seek therapy (I’ve had it before but thought it had worked as well as it could up to a point).\n\nA tel con with the GP results in my being put on the list for autism assessment referral. I’m also prescribed quetiapine, 25mg to begin, and to be taken alongside the sertraline. \n\nSoon after, I start weekly sessions by Zoom with a fantastic therapist, who really helps me to transform my life. \n\nSpring 2022: Receive autism assessment. Diagnosed autistic straight away — the psychiatrist said “no doubt at all”. \n\nManaged to get a good working from home job in late 2022, which I have held since and intend to stay at. \n\nSince then, I’ve been trying to taper and then finding that I don’t function without the meds. I managed to get off them in summer 2023 but by early October I felt a horrific sense of self-hatred and went back on them. \n\nOur second child was born in January 2024. After a while, I decided I’d try to taper off quetiapine so I’d feel less tired. We’d relocated by this time so I ended up having a tel con with the new GP, who was really good, advising me to taper very slowly (my previous doctor had advised me to cut from 100 to 75 etc on a weekly basis rather than taking two months, as my new GP advised!). \n\nAnyway, fast-forward to the last week of the year and I’m almost ready to go off quetiapine. It’s been 25mg every other day since early Nov. The trouble is, though, I’m  fucking deranged and I don’t realize it. I’m not sleeping well at all; I’m on edge all the time; I’m snapping at my wife and I’m upsetting my older daughter, who’s 8; I never feel heard; I can’t cope with anything; I feel as though my autonomy is being taken away from me whenever anyone so much as asks me a question about something I’m going to do; I feel like everything that’s said to me is a criticism, and my wife isn’t seeing me as a competent autonomous person; my wife urges me to get help. \n\nI tell her I will. I also pour out my resentment at taking drugs, pointing out that I feel like a zombie, I have no energy, I have no dynamism, my personality is absent, I used to be 11 and a half stone before taking these drugs and I’m now 14 and a half stone and fed up of feeling like a fat [redacted]…and much more. \n\nI resume the quetiapine, taking 50mg and actually sleeping properly for the first time in ages. I have about a week of feeling reasonably calm but I’ve had some bad days. I added another 25mg to take it to 75mg yesterday after I got extremely upset and started ranting when I was in the middle of a task and it got interrupted. \n\nAt this point, I’ve decided that I’ll contact the GP tomorrow. Clearly, I can’t go on like this. I just want to feel a sense of calm, to relate to my wife and kids, to feel as though I’m an autonomous being, and to be unbothered when I’m carrying out a task and it gets interrupted. At the moment, I feel that I’m constantly “in the way” and always at least five minutes behind where I need to be. I like to have systems in place, and to have anticipated people’s needs so they don’t have to ask me anything — if someone has to ask questions about what I’ve done or how I’m going to do an intended task, I feel that I’m an utter failure. I know, rationally, that that isn’t possible — so I need to seek advice. \n\nI’d love it if I could have some kind of help from mental health services to identify what MH disorder I have; the seriousness of it; what drugs I might take, preferably something other than sertraline and quetiapine, so that I don’t continue with ravenous hunger all day long. \n\nSorry, that wasn’t brief at all.

I work in social care and in the past year there have been so many changes to the way we work and financial pressures, it's like doing a different job. I used to love what I do, but now find it's all just paper work, finance panels with limited client contract, constant change and a huge workload. \n\nI have ADHD and definitely some autistic traits, my managers have been supportive wherever they can but I'm still finding the job extremely stressful. I get frustrated about the new ways of working, like everyone in my team. However, I do want to mention I've noticed the people who are really struggling/leaving, are also neurodivergent and saying they can't cope with the job or changes.\n\nI have really struggled with meeting deadlines, keeping up with changes and dealing with difficult situations. I'm an anxious person and my ADHD feeds into that massively, I'm not proud to say but similarly to my personal life, I often put things off longer than I should. I get so worked up about the 'ifs and buts' of what could happen, which then gets worse and worse by leaving it until I can't face it. This has lead to me being put on an informal performance procedure and again, is something I was so incredibly ashamed of that I didn't even tell my partner until recently.\n\nSo that brings me to now, I always thought I liked my job until I realised that everything else in my life was pretty good, the reason why I'm experiencing constant anxiety and burnout is because of it, I can't live like that. I've decided I want to find another job, but I'm also scared because I have a mortgage to pay. I woke up this morning and just cried into my coffee because I can't face logging on. I've not been sleeping, I can't eat and I've started stuttering terribly, purely due to my anxiety. I called up my deputy manager and basically just cried/had a panic attack down the phone where I told her I can't work today, she told me to take today and tomorrow off work and call the doctors, I did and they have signed me off on sick for 2 weeks due to stress.\n\nI now feel extreme guilt and I'm still stressed, just for a different reason.\n\n1. My whole job situation, I want to find another job but I'm so burnt out, even starting a new job, I will still be exhausted, I can't just leave as I have bills to pay. I don't even want to go back to my job at this point so feel very trapped.\n\n2. Guilt about any of my work that I haven't done this means one of my colleagues will have to pick up whilst I'm off, that has been the main thing putting me off going on sick.\n\n3. The people I work with, I recognise it isn't fair on them either, it's the part I feel most ashamed about as to continue in a job that I can't face at this point, is going to not only impact me negative but also them.\n\n4. The thought that people may think I'm being ignorant, there is a bit of a stigma around people who go off sick in my team and I know I shouldn't care what people think, but I would never want people to talk behind my back. Thinking I don't care etc and just taking some easy time off because I feel like I've pushed myself to this point trying to prove otherwise.\n\nSorry I just needed to get it out my system, if anyone has any advice or similar situations, please do share. I don't mind people being truthful, please put it in a nice way as obviously I am quite sensitive at the moment as basically, I feel like my life is going down the drain. \nThank you all for reading 🤍",

He struggles with basic daily tasks like eating, sleeping, and leaving the house, and his mental health prevents him from living independently. He has lived in various temporary accommodation hostels but is now staying with me.\n\nCaring for him is emotionally, physically, and financially overwhelming. My partner and I both work full-time, but looking after him is like having a second full-time job. He is financially dependent on us because his sick note was rejected for Universal Credit, and he was also denied PIP. This has left us with no outside financial or professional support.\n\nI’m reaching out because I am at breaking point and really need help. This situation is taking a huge toll on my mental health, and I feel like I’m constantly going in circles trying to get him the assistance he needs. I am hoping to access any resources, benefits, or professional support to improve his quality of life and provide some relief for us as his carers. I would also like advice on how to navigate the system more effectively and ensure that both his needs and mine are being met.",

I'm not even sure myself, but I've tagged it as vent as I feel like that's most appropriate.\n\nOn Friday I walked out of my emergency GP appointment. This is because, rather than addressing any of the issues I had, he instead decided to go on (and on) about the fact I had not had my medication for 2 months. This is due to the fact I couldn't get an appointment for my mood/medication review (as the surgery themselves messed up my appointment) and I also couldn't order my medication without going into the surgery (they couldn't do anything over the phone due to the fact it wasn't officially on my repeats). The meds didn't even seem to be doing much anyway, but I digress.\n\nI was already having a complete breakdown in the room before he started to dig into me too, like ???\n\nAnyway. I cannot, nor will I ever, go back to that GP. I was inconsolable, my mum had to call 111 for me as I could barely speak. Yay. Fantastic. Maybe something will get done.\n\nI get transferred to the mental health team I've already been assigned to... And they refuse to do anything to help me because I haven't had my first appointment yet (they actually pushed this appointment back too, so it's not for another 2 months). No hate to the guy who took the phone call as he seemed genuinely nice and it's obviously just how they operate. He was trying his best and I love that for him.\n\nSo now, until I've transferred to my new surgery, I have nobody to talk to unless I want to go to A&E. This is what I've been explicitly told. 111 cannot help. The mental health team cannot help. The crisis team? Nope. If I need help A&E is my only option regardless of the symptoms I'm presenting with. It does not have to be an emergency, but it is the only place I can go and I should go the next time I feel the need to call 111.\n\n\nAlso complete tangent and more funny than bad, but what's up with the random lore drops about myself I keep getting from the mental health team? 'Back in 2019 you were diagnosed with x' (never made aware) and in my most recent phonecall 'yeah, she can't have another doctor because of the things she's been diagnosed with. The doctor she has set up is perfect' (these are mystery diagnoses that I've not been made aware of, and I don't even know how I've been diagnosed with anything considering I've not met the doctor).\n\n\ntldr: I feel for the NHS, but people should not be in a position where A&E is their only point of call. Also getting diagnosed with stuff is wild.",

He is currently living at my uncles house and has been slowly losing weight to the point he has dropped around 6 stone in the past 4 months, due to depression/self starvation. He’s been slowly getting lower and lower and he had developed a reliance on cannabis which seems to just make things 100x worse. The past 3 days he has been threatening to end his life, leaving notes and then going missing. We called the police on Thursday and he was eventually found and they wrote up a report and got an emergency doctors appointment. On Friday my mum went with him to the appointment as my dad lies and says he is fine and downplays everything. She told the doctor everything and the doctor upped his dose of antidepressants (which we know he is not taking anyway) and got in contact with the crisis team. Yesterday the crisis team tried calling my dad but couldn’t get a hold of him so told my mum they were going to have to check on him at the place he’s living. They never did. Turns out he is missing again and a family friend called the police as they had found a note. Police find him around 5 hours later and detain him and take him to a&e and wait hours to be seen. The doctor calls my mum before seeing him to get more info and she clearly states he IS going to end his life and has a specific plan and intends to follow through on it on a specific date. The doctor sees him briefly and informs him they have no beds available and he will be in contact tomorrow and then let him leave as he ‘doesn’t have a plan for tonight’. That’s all well and good but are we meant to just keep calling the police every night when he goes missing and threatens to do something to himself? I feel like you can only get adequate help once you’ve done something to yourself instead of it being focused on prevention too. It’s infuriating for us as every night we are full of anxiety and we were honestly hoping he would be sectioned just so he can get help and so we know he’s safe and being watched over. Any advice would be appreciate on next steps or what we can do. Thanks. ",

My car is falling apart and I feel like I'm not living my life anymore. Home, work, work, home. In addition, this month we worked double, because we don't have enough staff and the work is underpaid. I'm away from home 50 hours a week, 1 hour there and 1 hour back with traffic, buses and traffic lights. I have no friends where I live, my parents are 2 hours away and I'm seriously thinking about quitting my job and sending everything to hell. I feel like shit, I feel like a person who hasn't been able to make the right choices in life and I feel condemned to live like this forever. I'm 33 years old and I can't see any light in the future, but only suffering and pain. I had idea to come back with parents but i fear to appear like a loser in front of people and especially women. \n\n\n\nI'm doing therapy that's helping me, even though I'm currently gripped by anxiety and moments of depression. Has anyone managed to get out of this situation? ",

    "selftext": "A comment I read in a different sub got me thinking about mental health provision and how it could be made more effective, and I thought I’d ask here for a first bit of investigation into the matter. \n\nHas anyone been seeing a counsellor or a therapist, who has admitted that maybe they aren’t right for you because they don’t have the correct tools and then directed you towards someone more suited to your needs? E.g. I’ve become aware that for cPTSD traditional counselling and talking methods (which may help anxiety say) can have negative effects by having the patient relive the trauma without resolving it, inadvertently making it more prominent and troublesome. In this case a therapist specialising in trauma and for example EMDR would be more appropriate and effective. Equally a trauma specialists methods may not be the most effective for helping depression. \n\nI can’t think of a time when I or anyone I know has had a therapist say, “actually for the best outcome you need to see X because they’re better equipped”. I don’t know if it’s a reticence to give up clients (and so earnings)? a denial of their own limits? Or maybe it’s because there is no structure in place which encourages such transfers and behaviours.\n\nThank you for reading, as I said the comment in another Sub really got me thinking that often people aren’t getting the best or the right care, and I’d appreciate any input to improve my knowledge (my next stop is to ask my therapist and a few others I know, but it’s something i may end up writing to my MP about). \n",

    "title": "How do I actually get somewhere?",
    "selftext": "This is going to be a long post. I’ll try to put a TL;DR at the end but I’d recommend reading all before offering advice. All advice is appreciated thanks, and I’m happy to answer any questions. \n\nI’m a nineteen year old male, and live in Scotland. Just for reference and context. \n\nI’ve been struggling with mental health effectively my whole life, but noticeably since I was seven. It started out with suspected autism (undiagnosed but again I’ve been told my several schools, and even some professionals that it’s incredibly likely). \n\nBut that to be honest is the least of my worries as in my eyes it’s probably low level. \n\nMy main issues that I need support for started in high school. I dealt with SA, trauma, anxiety, su*cidality, depression. The first person I told was the school counsellor who told my parents. My parents looked me in the eyes and told me I was “lying for attention”. \n\nRegardless, after a year of advocating for myself, they took me to the doctors. It took two or three doctors to finally get sent to CAMHS. I got lectured on how I would traumatise people and fuck up my liver, and was told to take warm baths and try walk more (at this point in time, I was bathing for relaxation at least 3 times a week, and walking around 6 miles, 5 days a week, out of necessity). \n\nThe advice got me nowhere. \n\nI nearly committed. \n\nFast forward to 16, I moved out of home and in with my now fiance, and finally had the courage to advocate for myself directly with a doctor, not having to go through my parents. This was difficult but I got there with the support of my partner. \n\nThe doctor did nothing and I assumed they gave up on me. After months of research I stumbled across private therapy through a local small business, and worked with an amazing woman for 2 years- I’m convinced she’s an angel. Unfortunately though, she had to move away and is now pursuing a much better career for herself. \n\n So I went back to the doctor, and with no consultation whatsoever, I was put on sertraline. For those who don’t know (because I didn’t), sertraline has a high likelihood of inducing suicidal thoughts in young males. I was taken off of it after having to phone out of hours for that exact reason. I then waited a month and spoke with an NHS psychiatrist who told me my sexuality was probably to blame, and that my parents were right to act the way I did. Not to mention her Freudian ramblings were frightening. \n\nI was put on fluoxetine, and put in a complaint regarding her care. Fluoxetine hit me like a truck. I was ill the whole trial month. So I was taken off of that too. \n\nFast forward to around September 2024. I developed agoraphobia. You know how people say “these things don’t happen overnight?”. I’m the exception to that rule. I quite literally developed it overnight. More explanation if you’d like over dms or whatnot, but it’s not entirely relevant. \n\nI’ve not left my house since before Christmas. And some days I don’t even leave my bed. This isn’t going away, and it’s not getting better. \n\nI’ve been phoning the doctor pretty much daily, and I’m getting nowhere, I’ve even contacted the CMHT directly, and they can’t or won’t give me any sort of response as to when I’ll get treatment. \n\nOut of hours can’t or won’t do anything either, most of the time they’ll just refer me to charities. I have no problem with charities, but as someone who struggles with depression, anxiety, CPTSD, and agoraphobia, charities can’t offer the support I need. \n\nFor those who don’t know- the course to work with a charity is 20 weeks. The course to be a psychotherapist is a minimum of three years. The course to be a psychiatrist is minimum 6-7 years.\n\nSo my question is- \n\nWhere do I go from here? Do I just show up to A&E? Do I keep politely begging the receptionist to listen to me? What am I actually supposed to do? I can’t afford psychotherapy now. Or else I’d get that. \n\nAlso- I’m aware self diagnosis is sometimes harmful. So let me say now- I do not officially have a diagnosis for agoraphobia, but based on my extensive personal research, I believe this to be my condition- if anyone has alternate theories, I’m open to hearing them. \n\nAlso- per the rules of the sub. I’m stating this outright. I have no current/active plans to end my life or otherwise cause harm to myself or others. ",

SSRI,SNRI but apparently they refuse to prescribe it in the UK and maybe make a petition for the government to trial Auvelity as it has very promising results the NHS mental health service is a joke and to many people take their lives each year because the British health service refuse to try new things anyway sorry about the long post any advice would be appreciated ",

    "selftext": "Hello. Trying to avoid a long post but I have a very long + fairly severe mental health history (diagnosed age 14, 29 now. OCD, personality disorder, some other diagnoses). I have tried several therapies and about 14 medications. Nothing is working - therapy helped a bit but I’m still in decline. I struggle to get out of bed most days.\n\nToday I saw my psychiatrist who has historically not been very helpful. Despite being upfront about my suicidality, he did not want to prescribe any medication or refer me for therapy, saying my issues are ‘personality based’ & therefore unlikely to respond to these. He wants me to continue trying behavioural activation on my own, and says the only person who can help me is myself. \n\nThe issue is, I’ve been doing behavioural activation for the last 8 weeks (or trying to) and I’m finding it very challenging to engage with. I struggle to stick to the routine, find myself overwhelmed by even simple tasks, and generally haven’t found it helpful so far. My psychiatrist says this is due to perfectionism on my part (though I personally disagree). \n\nSince this is the only treatment option I have right now, I was hoping for some tips and assistance on how to better engage with behavioural activation. I was working on it for 8 weeks with a mental health practitioner so I feel like I understand the theory… I just can’t seem to break through the exhaustion + overwhelm + evil to actually make myself do the tasks, even if they are really tiny. Sorry if this is a stupid question, I’m just desperate & feeling like I have no options & not sure what I can do.",

I've been through the cloud and even recycle bins and all sorts of useless rubbish has been backed up but none of those photos.\n\nI've always had a very poor body image, moreso over the past 6 years where I gained a lot of weight. I've always wanted a child but always hated the idea of a pregnant body.\nI've now realised just how fucked my brain is. I could barely look at myself whilst pregnant but I was also so emotionally detached from my bump. It never felt real until I had my baby in my arms. \n\nNot much point to this post I know, I just needed to vent. I've cried all day and am so filled with regret that I've let my self loathing get in the way of what I now realise was such a special time that should have been celebrated. I'm so disappointed in myself and am debating seeking help as I think these issues may have deeper roots than I previously realised. \n\nSo yeah, if you're pregnant - take the photo.\nIf your girlfriend/partner/wife/baby mamma is pregnant - take the photo.",

I was worried about my prescription not transferring but on the phone my new GP assured me it would be okay. \n\nI have been registered with this new GP for a week or two, and went to order my repeats. They told me under no circumstances I could recieve them until a doctor and onsite pharmacist had an evaluation with me, I asked how I could book this and they informed me there was a backlog for a month! I asked if this was normal and they said that the pharmacist felt it was for the best to ensure everything is all good. They wanted me to fill out some form’s answering questions but it was really invasive stuff about whether I’m pregnant? This is impossible as I’m gay, and I’m sure I would know if my girlfriend suddenly turned into a man… And this seemed super irrelevant to the situation. \n\nThis is really spooky, and I don’t know what to do, I have enough left for a week, and I know I could call 111 for an emergency but they can only give so much at a time. \n\nWhat can I do?

I saved for years for it, got it a little while back in an attempt to get an investment for my future and it’s been nothing but trouble since. \n\nFirst, It needed work doing to it: Our builders caused 10s of thousands in damages and then walked out. They then disappeared. Its cost tens of thousands more to fix their mistakes and the damage to my place and surrounding properties (massive leaks into other flats needing extensive repairs etc)\n\nFinally finished building, tried to get building control sign off - the company we used went bust when the CeO walked out with all the money and disappeared. The new building control wanted all work taken apart so they could see the build ‘in progress’. More money, more time.\n\nFinally finished that, got sign off, come to sell - now I’m told because it’s near a commercial premises no lender will agree a mortgage. I apparently need to go auction or cash only - and need to take off 20% of value. I’ve calculated that I can pay back loans on all the building work - but all the money I invested (the deposit, other works, and the equity so far) I’ll lose. My lender didn’t tell me this when I got mortgage - apparently it’s a change they’ve made since then. 150k in total. My life savings. And the meagre amount I was hoping to build a little life for me and my family. Gone. \n\nIt’s beyond soul crushing. I’ve managed throughout the whole process - all the stress and everything - but now I see it was all for nothing. Not even that it was all for negative investment. I was paying for nothing. And now I’m wrecked, financially annihilated. It doesn’t feel good. \n\nTL:DR - builders and bankers are universally terrible. As is life tbh. ",

I am no way saying other people with ADHD do this, this is just my personal experience and anecdote.**   \n\n\nHey guys and welcome to the show! \n\nI have ADHD. - I'm also a fucking idiot. - I'm also medicated, but *still* a fucking idiot. - Medication just masks all the symptoms but it's just chemicals in your brain right?!?! RIGHT?!?. - who knows if they actually work or not. - I may aswell be taking pills that are made of sugar or something. \n\nSo lets get right too it! it shouldn't take long!\n\nOK here's the steps needed on how to destroy connections with other people.... FOR GOOD! So if you love having depression and all the other shite that comes with it, then read on!\n\nNUMERO UNO: Get talking to a potential person that you want to upset and have them HATE you!\n\nTWO: SPAM each other with constant messages about your condition and whatever else, make sure you use meme's and gifs to convey your thoughts BUILD THAT CONNECTION AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN so you can watch it burn in a few weeks time!\n\nTHREE: Catch feelings! we all love feelings! send them pics! receive pics! add them on snapchat/discord and whatever the fuck else.. KEEP TALKING! it's only a matter of time!\n\nFOUR: We are close to now to destroying that connection for good! time to buy the petrol and make sure you have a lighter handy or matches or some sort contraption you can start the fire with!\n\nFIVE: DECLARE YOUR FEELINGS! CEMENT THAT CONNECTION! GET EMTIONALLY INVOLVED!\n\nSIX: Now for the REVEAL! - Find something out about them that you KNOW you should tell them! keep it a secret! if they ask, JUST LIE, You know you should tell them because that's what decent people do, but get this, you're not a decent person you're a LIAR. use cryptic messaging! tell them that sometimes stuff can be insightful! WOOO.. we are nearly there.\n\nSEVERN: GET CALLED OUT ON YOUR BS! - Start that fire with the petrol and matches or lighter you got previously in FOUR! - You have now succeeded destroying a connection in less then 4 weeks, you don't know why you lied but YOU DID. you have no excuse for what you did, it just happened, you can't explain your mindset and you beg for forgiveness, get rejected, make sure that person tells you how much you upset them. \n\nEIGHT: Get deleted on EVERYTHING. Spend Christmas depressed as fuck! - they don't talk to you anymore, you now have try and forget them, the hole you dug is filled with shite and your emotions are all over the fucking place, everything is chaos but YOU LOVE IT! it's what you wanted RIGHT??!\n\nThanks for coming to my ted talk!",

    "selftext": "After traveling extensively around the world and living in countries like America, Canada, and several cities across Europe and Asia, I eventually landed in England due to family reasons. At first, I was genuinely excited about this new chapter, but that excitement quickly faded as I started to experience what I can only describe as a cultural shock.\n\nLiving in London, I’ve struggled to connect with people on a meaningful level. The social atmosphere feels incredibly closed-off and rigid. Many of the people I’ve encountered seem stuck up or disinterested in forming connections. It’s disheartening. I’ve even met a few people from northern England who came across as outright racist, while those from the south seem to avoid communication altogether. The overall vibe is just unfriendly and stiff, and I can’t seem to figure out how to break through this barrier.\n\nThis is especially baffling because when I lived in America, I was able to make friends within the first month of being there. People were open, curious, and willing to connect. Here, it’s the complete opposite. I’ve tried everything I can think of—joining apps, attending meetups, and putting myself out there—but nothing seems to work. It feels like no one wants to engage, and the lack of response has left me feeling isolated.\n\nI’ve noticed that the roads are incredibly narrow, and the houses feel so small and cramped. How can a place be called a three-bedroom house when one of the bedrooms is barely 6 by 6 feet? It’s hard not to wonder if this sense of physical confinement translates to a narrow mindset as well.\n\nWhat’s even more shocking is meeting locals who’ve grown up here and hearing them say they don’t have close friends or don’t even know how to make them. It’s like loneliness is a normal part of life here, and I can’t wrap my head around it. Everyone seems weirdly detached or socially stunted, and it’s incredibly frustrating. I just want to understand—what is going on here?\n\n",

She said that she’s going to speak to CAHMS and asked me to come back in two weeks. I asked her if it could be possible to get fluoxetine as I’m turning 18 in under half a year but it’s already approved for both adolescents and adults, and I’ve seen medical research papers showing it’s efficacy as a potential misophonia treatment. I let her know that I’ve tried some talking therapy services to no avail. She told me that she will ‘ask a CAHMS specialist’ and get back to me, and that they may want to try talking therapies with me before prescribing it. I’d really appreciate it if anyone here could give possible advice on what the next steps might look like.\n\nI’m also seeking support for potential ADHD - she gave me an ASRS v1.1 to fill out after our appointment and 5/6 of my section 1 answers fell into the dark grey.

Ive been phoning the police and my housing association/council for 4 years since I moved in reporting and showing evidence.  \n\nBasically I have a real spiteful upstairs neighbor. He smokes crack in his flat and takes other prescription drugs. He throws the foil and pill packets out the upstairs window directly down onto my side of the building. Ive been sat in my car and bits of foil have come from upstairs and hit my car. The entrance to my side of the building is covered with foil, pill packets and various other litter that gets thrown from upstairs. Yet when you go round to his entrance of the building its spotless. \n\nIf he notices I have my window open he will say racist things super loudly on purpose to make sure I hear. (Im mixed race). The stomping and constant movement when hes cracked out is impossible to drown out. 8 hour cleaning sessions from midnight to 8am constant hoovering. \n\nI cant sit in my flat and have any sort of peace unless hes going through withdrawals or knocked out from having a seizure. Reguarly have to sleep in my car. I really only use my flat to shower and cook now. \n\nIve grew up in council flats but ive never experienced anything like this. The police dont care. The housing association people dont even care. The guy wont listen to me and the last time i tried confronting him he just said if i dont like it go back to where i came from. Im english born and raised here. Im just mixed race. \n\nI dont know how to resolve this without violence. He constantly makes comments about foreigners, blacks coming into his country and taking all the resources. Yet I work and this guy is using benefit money to buy crack. \n\nI struggle finincially and cant afford to rent privately. I just dont know what to do. Other people in the estate dont speak to me and give me filthy looks obviously the entrance to my my flat is littered with drugs and other shit. Where I park my car its covered with bits of foil so it looks like its all coming from me. 100% being done on purpose by this neighbour.",

As a kid I always felt “different”, struggled in school, had sensory issues and constantly felt like I was doing something wrong leading me to develop severe anxiety. \n\nI’d been through CAHMS as a young child and the ADHD wasn’t picked up because I was “too outgoing and bubbly” instead they diagnosed my meltdowns as Asthma and I ended up taking medication for that for years.\n\nWhen I was 13 I was diagnosed with GAD due to constantly being afraid of “doing something wrong” or “being weird”. I was sent to CBT therapy which didn’t work, because I couldn’t simply “be mindful and tell they bad thoughts they’re not helpful right now” like your average person, my brain was moving 1000mph I could barely sit through the sessions. So they put me on Setraline/Zoloft 150mg. I have since been on Zoloft for almost 8 years.\n\nThis medication is great for a lot of people but it wasn’t right for me, but I stuck with it because CAHMS psychiatrists told me that the adjustment period takes time and I trusted them. \n\nAt age 16 I was suddenly told by a psychiatrist that I was to wean myself off the medication and she instructed me to take my dose every other day. This made me so incredibly sick I can’t even describe how bad it was. She then called back a few weeks later to say she was wrong and under no circumstances was I to take the medication every other day but instead wean off incredibly slowly.\n\nA few months ago I explored an ADHD diagnosis and scored the highest possible score for every assessment they did, I was put on Vyvance and since then the anxiety is gone, I have excelled at my university work, and finally began to take care of myself properly.\n\nBut i’m still on this Sertraline which did nothing for me but make me sick. Now i’m trying to slowly reduce the dose on my own with a pill cutter and im hoping to be off of it within a year, adult mental health services since turning 18 have done nothing to assist me or conduct reviews on the medication for the last 2 years. When leaving CAHMS i was offered no assistance simply a leaflet about the adult mental health services.\n\nHonestly I spent a lot of time really sad about how mistreated I was in my childhood and how an extremely obvious ADHD diagnosis was not ever picked up simply because I was a loud young girl.\n\nBut now i’m just moving forward and trying to get on with things. I really hope one day CAHMS gets called out for everything they’ve done.",

I even thought that I was healed - I could talk about my past problems openly from a place of genuine understanding. Yet despite all of that, I cracked after lengths of loneliness and the fear of it being my perpetual reality - and made poor decisions. I recognized my poor decisions and attempted to correct them, but it was too late.\n\nI have crossed the dark line with attempting to take things too far in the past, and walked away physically unscathed. Today though, after a day I shall never forget, I got home and I felt that black yawning numbness pull me to reach for that same path as before. I don't want to violate sub-rules, so I'll leave that part there and state that I'm not at imminent risk.\n\nOne good decision I think I've made is that I just reached out to a friend and ask them to come to me for the weekend, and they are. This is the first time I've ever opened up to a friend in such a vulnerable state and asked them to drop what they're doing for me. The thought of doing so in the past always made me feel like I was weak and unable to fix this on my own, and worst of all: that it's real. But I'm ready to accept external help and let go of my stupid pride of trying to fix it all on my own.\n\nNow my fear is, what happens after he leaves? My friend being here is a bandaid solution, at best. The concept of an eternal never-ending tomorrow fills me with the anxiety of a grief I have to face - but one that I don't want to.\n\nI really don't want to go to therapy again. As helpful as it can be, I don't feel like shelling out a bunch of cash for it again, and trying to get a doctors appointment for a medical issue is bad enough, let alone mental health support. \n\nI think what I really need to do something about is the loneliness. I don't think I can become immune to dealing with it, nor should I have to. But I guess that's why I'm reaching out here - I just need to help putting my thoughts together and making some better decisions.

But I do minimum exercise because *I'm depressed and too tired all the time*. I literally slept for 24 hours out of the last 36, and that's not unusual - couldn't keep my eyes open, and that was *after* I drank a can of monster to see if it would help. I've tried staying off of caffeine and exercising every day even for 10 minutes. I still feel like 12 hours of sleep a night isn't enough, and will often need a nap afterwards, \n* Lethargy, which I explain above, so I won't get into that. \n   * I just find it super annoying that advice is 'do more exercise' when I can barely get out of bed! \n   * Personally, I cannot limit the food I have in my house because we live in the middle of nowhere - so shopping is always bulk stocking. \n   * I saw someone saying that they had to eat like 500 calories a day to maintain their average weight due to the inability to exercise. That doesn't sound healthy, but it rings true. \n\n\n\nApparently coming off of mirtazapine can be a nightmare, so I'd like to just put all this out on the internet in case folks are starting. \n\nIf it works, it works, but if you don't have an at-home gym for a 10 minute super run & you can't start any diet plans, can't afford new clothes... \n\nAlso if you have any sort of body dysmorphia or dysphoria (like me), it is something to consider.\n\nIf anyone has experience with all this, advice would be greatly appreciated. \n\n(Note: I would like to *not* regain my anxiety & depression because I love working but I just get so overwhelmed by it, even on mirtazapine.)

Some good help and a really supportive and caring GP and some not so good experiences with other services which kind of brought me to a breaking point on Friday. I expressed quite strong thoughts of not wanting to go on anymore to my partner and he convinced me to ring the crisis team helpline at 2am. The person I spoke to realised just talking to me about random topics wasn't very distracting and if anything making me worse so they transferred me to their consultant. She was much nicer and understanding but my partner felt she wasn't going to provide any immediate help either so he asked if he could speak to her and told her he doesn't feel I'm very safe at the moment. I remember getting very angry and scared even though I knew rationally he was just worried and trying to help. I thought I would be taken away to a hospital and sectioned and it would all be his fault (again, I knew at the same time that I wasn't thinking clearly). Thankfully no hospital in the end. The consultant decided to refer me to the home treatment team and they came for a visit and a chat on Sunday and have admitted me to their service. She said they will come for regular house visits and just try and help that things don't escalate further.\n\nMy first visit is tomorrow and I'm just wondering if anyone has any experience with this service?

    "selftext": "Sorry, this may be quite long! Well, so far everything seems to be going in a good direction after multiple horrible interactions with my local mental health services. The christmas holidays really affected me this year and have been going through an intense few days of being in crisis. On Thursday night going into Friday morning i attempted luckily my bf was able to stop me and call 999. As he had to physically restrain me from hurting myself police and paramedics arrived in like 10 minutes and i was taken to a local hospital. I was assessed by the psych team (who were quite cold and honestly a lot of the time quite judgmental) in the hospital and was going to be referred to the home treatment team and sent home but my bf was reluctant for us to go home considering the physical struggle we had and didn’t want me to be at risk of myself at home and so instead was going to be sent to a crisis home in the region. For some context i have a working diagnosis of Autism and so A&E is one of the most overstimulating places for me and so after around 8 hours there i asked if there was a possibility i could go home as i was feeling very overwhelmed. The psych team had said yes and that someone would be in touch.\n\nThe following day, i was again in crisis and this time called the crisis line who then told me that i had apparently declined the help and went home saying i felt better (which was not the case) and that the only way to get help is to go back to A&E on friday night. We got there and this time the wait to even initially speak to someone was 4 hours, this time i was in the waiting room and so was even worse for me and after speaking to a rude receptionist who said “you haven’t even been here that long, you’re not the only one waiting” after asking what could be done to help with me again feeling overwhelmed, i went home. At this point i was feeling a bit dejected and couldn’t see a way out of this crisis i decided to try the crisis line again on Saturday morning explaining why i couldn’t go to A&E and was told “if you really want help, you’ll go to A&E”, “you’re just going to have to suck it up” and “it can’t be that bad if you went home, because the obvious answer is to stay”. Me and my bf are also quite broke and the trips home from A&E are affecting us financially and so i am now adamant on not going for my sanity and so we can still afford to eat and heat the house. So last night i was at rock bottom and thought to try one more time this morning but instead 111 and not the crisis line.\n\nI spoke to an amazing lady who listened to my concerns and took all the details into account. I was very open with her on how i felt a risk to myself as i had found where my bf had hidden the risky items in the home and he was asleep and the urge to SH and possibly even worse was creeping in. I really hoped this wouldn’t automatically mean i have to go to the hospital but thought it would be best to be open and honest with her and not hide the details. In hindsight i’m so glad i did, she spoke to my bf on the phone and gave him instructions on how to keep me safe and keep me distracted, and she’s referring me to a Crisis Assessment Team who will come to my house today and see what next steps can be taken. All while avoiding the hospital. Her name was Gifty and i know she won’t read this but i’m thanking her with every fibre of my being because just being listened to feels so comforting. I hope things keep on this path today. I guess i’m just writing because i was so close in the last 3 days to giving up and this is a reminder to myself and to anyone who reads it, if anyone does, to keep pushing.",

They said section 3 is for people who don’t comply with treatment but I take my meds and PRN. So I did as they said and then had emergency discharge due to another patients actions having police called on us while I was with them - the one thing wards hate is police spotlight on them! \n\nThis admission I was sectioned on the 2nd December with it ending on the 30th. I refused my first week ward round, made 3 attempts, put on 1-1 for 7 days and almost succeeded in absconding while on the ward. I went to my second week ward round and they mainly asked why I did the above as it’s out of character for me I usually comply. I really didn’t want this admission and believe it is just a pause button and containment to stop me hurting myself due to CPTSD. I was told to engage in ‘treatment’ by communicating to staff how I feel and meeting with the ward psych and do OT activities.\n\nIt’s been the Christmas period so the psych isn’t back until the 6th Jan - I haven’t met her - the OT activities are back on from the 2nd but I have no OT leave on my s17 form?? So in the interim I’ve just been in my room, ate, slept and repeat. \n\nI asked what is going to happen as today is a normal day (Friday 27th Dec) and my section ends on Monday so I’m anxious of the outcome as I have no community support every referral for core team or care -coordinator or therapy gets declined but the hospital is adamant I have a community team when and are shocked when I explain this isn’t the case. \n\nLONG STORY SHORT: the consultant is working from home and emailed when I requested an update from the charge nurse that I will be made informal following a ward round on Monday (the day the section ends). We have not had a conversation about this so how can I be made informal if I haven’t agreed to voluntarily extend my admission in hospital - I’m aware they just don’t want to section 3 me cause of costs and tribunal paperwork etc. and don’t want to discharge me as there has been solely containment no treatment while on section due to the festive period. \n\nQUESTION: If I’m made informal can I refuse and if I do and I’m put on a section 5(2) which they threatened me with before what happens after the 72 hour hold if I still don’t agree to be informal? The treatment required is by people who don’t return to work until a week after my section ends so what is the point in engaging with the OT and ward psychologist for one or two sessions as I’m sure they won’t keep me informal for longer than 3 weeks.. I hope! Also I can’t appeal being informal or go to a tribunal so it feels like I’m forced a decision and confinement without my consent which goes against the humans rights act of 1998. \n\nSorry this is so long I’m really stressed out knowing every time I’m discharged I’m triggered trying to fight for my safeguarding alone by meeting with the LA and have follow up hosp appointments due to fleeing DV/SV and have flashbacks in the house I live in from it which prevents sustainable recovering mental health and leads to admission after admission with no change, so why should I stay informal now when a couple meetings won’t support me in the community, I have no community team and feel like I’ve completely lost myself through my CPTSD and multiple hospital admissions which lead to nothing long term.

I don't have a set address because I have a job where I work all over England and unfortunately I never know where I'm going to be without much notice or for how long. \nI am need of a doctor as well as a psychiatrist - I take a certain medication that I will run out of in just under 2 months. I'm not really sure how to go about either of these things though without having a set location so my question is this: \n1. Are there virtual doctors I can see and if so can someone provide a link? Also will they be able to write a prescription over the phone? \n2. How do I find a psychiatrist and is it a relatively accessible thing here in the UK? In Canada it's not very easy to see one as I waited 9 months before. The problem is that I'm taking medication at the moment with very little guidance and it seems to have stopped working. \n3. If this fails, is there such a thing as acute patient care in the UK (basically a psych ward that helps control and adjust your medications etc when in crisis) and how would I access that. \n4. If no one knows the answers to any of these things is there possibly a number for a really nice nurse I could ask 😭 I am starting to become desperate with anxiety for my stupid situation. \n\nThank you all ",

    "title": "advice for dealing with mentally ill friend in 2025",
    "selftext": "Short background summary: Dealing with friend who has Social anxiety from past experiences. Has a therapist who sometimes help but sometimes isn't that great. Tried meds but didnt work. Met him when he was in bad emotional state but through motivational speeches and advices addressing his different problems, I was able to somewhat cheer him up and get in a better state. However, he still has his problems and still can fall into depressive moods. I have helped him through 2 `suicide` attempts (may and june.) but the advice speech i came up with in early december has done the best so far. Yes I have set boundaries and realised I am not a fixer and whatnot, but he's in my classes and I can run but I can't hide. Also I can't speak to a therapist myself due to an issue I ran into accessing the NHS but thats a story for another day.\n\nNow to the present. It's xmas break and I already know the differenty ways to act depending on his mood. For example, if he's acting super depressed, i'll give him tissues and say \"here's 5 minutes to cry and let it all out.\" If he's ranting, I'll try to show a different perspective or give advice on that matter. If he's sitting there looking a mildly depressed and not talking alot, I'll either send him to the dining hall to face his fear then he'll feel productive and less worthless, abruptly say a motivatonal speech related to something I think he's worrying about and hope for the best or take him to the school library to use the computers in hopes he will cheer up. The first one has worked the most. If he's looking \"happy\" then I'll try steer the conversation away from mental health to keep him distracted. if he's hanging out with other friends then i'll take a break on my own to recharge and prevent devloping compassion fatigue.\n\nFor 2025, I need to plan on how to \"deal with\" him so he dosen't fall into depression or `suicidal thoughts.`Now I know you guys are gonna say \"It's not your responsibility\" but unfortunatley the persons/organisations which are supposed to be responsible are not cutting it. The HOY said to my friend last academic year\" If no one likes you can come to me.\" Like who thought it was a good idea to reconfirm a cognitive distortian, especially one a mentally ill person holds. This made him even worse. As for the other teachers the best thing they can do is refer him into school counsellor and thats just the same thing as therapy which he already has. His therapist sometimes gives out good advice but the time she gave out bad advice was during his worst time mentally (same time as suicide attempt) so it's 50/50 on the therapist side. His parents are paying for his therapy and there's not much else they can do.\n\nThis leaves me to do a sizeable amount of work supporting him so he dosen't fall into anything worse. Here's a table of the advices/speeches which did and didn't work\n\n|Did Work|Didn't Work|\n|:-|:-|\n|Social skills will matter less as everyone will be focusing on their GCSE rather than socialising|You Need to be more grateful|\n|All girls talk shit about people, don't worry, it's not just you.|It's all in your head|\n|It's not what being said, it's who's saying it.|You're not worthless|\n|People don't care enough about you to hate you|Stop caring what people think (I made up a speech that worked for a few weeks but I think it's human nature to care what people think)|\n|People are not ruminating about how you did something wrong the same way you are. ( I didn't say exactly this but I said something similar which kind of worked.|Find things to love about yourself|\n|School football gets very competitive and people will even scold their friends for making mistakes. Don't take their criticisms too personally.|You need to stop crying and complaining and surf through the waves in life.|\n|You're on your own path in life. (Related to a YouTube video he watched about overcoming jealousy)|Embrace your unique personality|\n\nThe list can go longer but this is just a brief summary. I hope you had a clearer picture from the table above. What I'm asking for is:\n\n* What other pieces of advice/speeches you know of I can deliver to him? The problems he still has are things like \"I hate myself,\" \"I'm awkward,\" a people-pleasing habit of buying food when they don't have money on their account, fear of crowds, etc. He has solved/improved on problems like not taking mean comments personally or not getting jealous through my motivational speeches, but problems still arise and can worsen into depression. I need speeches to cheer him up.\n* Should I get him to do exposure therapy or should I leave it at giving advice?\n* Should I adress his people pleasing problem? He says it stops him from getting depressed and suicidal but that seems like that could go wrong. I was thinking about explaining the quote \"Give an inch and take a mile\" but I feel as he wouldn't respond to that well as this habit keeps him happy.\n* What do I say when he says \"there's nothing good about me\" or \"i hate my life\"?\n\nThank you for reading. If there's more advice you can give which I haven't asked for, please share it.",

I also have ADHD and all my personality states appear to have ADHD but they tend to experience symptoms a little differently. \n\nIn my head I feel like I have several different personalities that cause me to feel differently depending which one is most active.\n\nI spoke to a GP and she seemed happy it was related mostly to the anaesthetic and that since the outcome was positive it shouldn't be a problem. \n\nI'm happy not to be the person I was before because I used to have terrible emotional regulation and that led to a lot of dissociation and chronic depression. \n\nThis new me feels extremely calm in comparison and loves being social where before I was a huge introvert. \n\nI do still talk to the old me but they've been relegated to just a part of my mind.

I also explained that I couldn’t fall asleep because of past traumas, and even when I did sleep, I woke up many times because of them. Every morning, I woke up with my heart racing and felt completely overwhelmed by the extreme sense of despair, as if my life was over and the only way to find peace was through the dark solution.\n\nThe GP asked me whether I had tried or planned to go for the dark solution. I told her no, I didn’t plan it because I knew it would devastate my family.\n\nShe then told me to come back in three weeks, explaining that she couldn’t prescribe antidepressants when I had only been experiencing this level of depression for two weeks. I explained that I had been depressed for much longer than two weeks, but the extreme urge to go for the dark solution had started two weeks ago. Despite this, she still told me to come back in three weeks.\n\nDuring those three weeks, my life was hell. I actually ended up making a detailed plan for how I would go for the dark solution, and sometimes, when I felt unbearably stressed, I found myself searching for any possible way to do it.\n\nI’m now also extremely stressed because my request for antidepressants was rejected, even though I feel like my symptoms weren’t mild. I no longer want to talk to the same GP and would like to speak to a different one.\n\nI am not British, and my British partner says every GP would have done the same because the side effects of antidepressants are extremely dangerous. He says UK healthcare protocol doesn’t allow GPs to prescribe antidepressants unless a person has suffered for a long enough period of time. He also says I am being negative and that it’s wrong for me to accuse the GP.\n\nHowever, I am not sure how the side effects of antidepressants could be worse than me going for the dark solution.

    "selftext": "I recently got a letter from the local CMHT letting me know I'm on the waitlist and it had the address of the clinic on it. Obviously this is premature since they haven't assigned me a care coordinator yet but I'm worried about the location.\n\nI live in a commuter town for a city. The clinic is in another commuter town for the city. These two towns do not have public transport links - it's a 20 minute drive between them but you have to get a bus into the city and then back out so it takes 1.5-2 hours on public transport. I looked at Ubers and it would naturally be extortionate.\n\nI'm sure they'll offer online appointments but I really hate online appointments, it's much harder to have a real conversation and I'm paranoid about being overheard.\n\nI'm just so frustrated by this. I don't understand why they can't have the clinic in the city which would make it roughly a 40 minute-1 hour journey from either town rather than favouring one town massively. Feels like a postcode lottery. \n\nI looked on the CMHT'S website and it looks like they have another clinic on the outskirts of the city which would be closer to a 1 hour journey by bus for me. But I'm guessing if they've sent me a letter with the first address I've been arbritarily 'assigned' to that team based on my home address which is roughly equidistant between the two driving wise.\n\nJust a vent really but if anyone's spotted some magical solution I've not thought of please do tell. I just feel like I'm fighting so hard to even be seen by the CMHT but even if they ever agree to see me it seems like I won't actually be able to do it so what's the point of any of it.",

Lives at home with me and my parents, we've cared for him since 2014, parents in their 60s. He has been prescribed fluoxetine and fultium D3 tablets, and a monthly olanzapine injection, he actively refuses to take the tablets, upon being prompted by my parents, he  verbally and physcially abuses us so we've given up. He refuses to tell doctors in medical reviews and appts about the side effects of medication and  symptoms he may be experiencing and taking any further help.  With him not taking his medications, comes verbal and physical aggression.  He  broke his bedroom window with a stone from the garden last year, he was violent with my father some time ago, and yesterday he was physically abusive towards us and our pets. He has been sectioned before and they switched his antipsychotic medication to risperidone tablets which didn't work at all. He won't let my parents talk to the doctors when we ever go privately either to get him more help. Now, what has happened is, his assisted accommodation has been arranged, but we will have to wait sometime before costing and risk assessment is done to ensure others and he is safe whilst living there, due to the incident a few days ago. Now it is getting to breaking point, how best I can help him to seek help and give our family respite, when we've never had a amicable relationship with him even before this diagnosis?

Give up my pets, home and kids to move to a different LA to be seen by a different healthboard.\n3. or allow myself to get bad again (everyday os already a huge fight) and hope that my next attempt results in me being taken to hospital via ambulance rather than going in with a family member to have someone take me seriously.\nIs anyone else stuck classed as too sick for most standard resources but not sick enough for cmht and serious help. Is there anything that can be done to help those who are stuck in limbo. \nAll stories and advice welcome im truely stuck i pay for private online therapy and shes so dissappointed in the system and how it leaves a whole classification of people stranded unable to recieve care and help and expected to deal with it alone or put it all on family and friends which damages and strains relationships resulting in making life worse for those that really need support and need more support than those who have mild needs and can use peer support and simple coping mechanisms that dont work for those who are in more need but have no access.

I know that she likely isn’t serious in these thoughts but I don’t know how to approach telling her I need to talk to someone.

This led to a suicide attempt in October. Following this, he went to an NHS mental health ward for several weeks and has now moved to a different city with a close family member. This has definitely provided a safe space for my Grandad, but he is still suffering immensely. This is also causing great strain to my family as they are now full time caring and essentially on suicide watch as he is still mentioning how he is suicidal. I was disappointed to find that there was no 1-1 therapy available at the mental health ward, so since the suicide attempt he has had no 1-1 therapy. He previously had phone therapy through the NHS before October, however this didn't seem to be helpful apart from being a lovely chat every couple of weeks. I don't think he was prepared to accept therapy at that point though, as he was a lot more closed off and hid a lot of his issues whereas now he is opening up a lot more.\n\nMy heart absolutely breaks for him and I'm researching options that may be available - we are completely happy going private as we want the best available care as soon as possible. \n\nI have been researching in home care, inpatient facilities, therapists (ideally clinical psychologists), rehabs etc. \n\nI would just like to hear of anybodies experiences and recommendations for services we can look into! \n\nThank you so much in advance, and sending love to all those who are currently struggling with their mental health.

I’ve been with them for awhile now and I’ve been waiting like 2 months for this phone call to speak to them and it went absolutely horribly. They were basically saying that they needed me to try more and that I was refusing things, and that they don’t know how else to help me. I repeatedly stopped the conversation to tell them they aren’t understanding me at all. It feels like they are not listening to anything I’m saying. I was bawling and crying and getting so frustrated on the phone, it makes me so angry they just don’t get it.\n\nI have been in mental health services for years now and nothing has helped, not a single thing. I have depression, agoraphobia, anxiety disorder, autism. I have tried many medications and other things like cbt and talking therapy over the years, nothing has shifted anything. The occupational therapist had multiple phones calls with me before, but everything she was trying to get me to do was too hard and not possible. And the psychiatrist just keeps offering me medication which is absolutely useless. None of them have even slightly shifted my mood or the way I think, and she’s absolutely just throwing anything at me at this point. I’ve told her I can no longer take medication and she just won’t stop suggesting it, so now I’m the difficult one for saying no.\n\nI was crying on the phone to them telling them how I just can’t take it anymore and I feel like I’m rapidly deteriorating and almost going insane, that I’m struggling with everything and can barely get by in a day. That I’m so desperate to commit su*cide and see no other way out and I feel like any day now I have to do it because there is no help. She suggested I come into hospital which I’ve already told her is absolutely impossible for me because of my agoraphobia. She also suggested ECT and was making it out like I was being difficult for refusing!! I absolutely don’t want to try ECT, and it would also require me going to the hospital multiple times which I’ve already told her I cannot do! The only thing that actually happened was she kept telling me to get a blood test done by a gp, because of my eating habits, but I kept telling her how do you expect me to get outside to do that if I’m telling you I can’t do that!! So frustrating. The phone call was ended strangely where I don’t know if she’s contacting me again, but it seems I’m mostly out of options with the mental health team. \n\nNow I feel completely broken and defeated. I’ve been through my gp who then sent me to the adult mental health team who now also don’t know what else to do with me. I’m freaking out and don’t know what to do. I am severely struggling and incredibly su*cidal. I don’t do anything all day and I struggle with every single thing. Even just getting by one day is so hard and dramatic that it’s not normal or sustainable to live like this. I feel so mentally ill and it feels like nobody understands me. I kept telling them I feel almost insane or psychotic even, like my brain and appearance are changing and becoming very sick. These past two months have been the worst in my entire life, and now I’m so scared because the team seem to be done with me. And now I’m expected to just waltz out my house and get a blood test done, when I can no longer manage things anymore. I understand there’s only so much they can offer but it feels like nothing I’m saying is actually being listened to. I am deteriorating and so is my body I don’t even know what to say. Is this really all there is left for me? That I either try ECT or go through months of trying medications? Because I can’t do either of them and don’t know what to do.

Yesterday I called the housing association about the level of noise and how she is keeping me awake at night and they did their usual and told me I needed to go and speak to her. Yesterday evening I heard her getting violent. She was shouting and swearing, hitting things, throwing things, it was so loud it didn't matter what room I was in I couldn't hear myself think. As angry as I was I was still concerned for her safety and called 111 who couldn't help because I don't know my neighbour. I know her first name and that's it. They advised I call the policed so I called 101 who told me to call them ambulance service. Called 999 around 5pm they said they would send someone out to her and that someone would be in touch. I got a call at 8:47 for some follow up questions then another call from a different person at 9:07. The second call they basically said they weren't going to do anything. They asked me the same questions, asked me to give the phone to my neighbour so they could speak to her which obviously I couldn't do. They wanted her contact details and her date of birth which I don't have. I was a bit pushy about it because it sounded like she was hurting herself and her behaviour is having a huge impact on my mental health too. They said they would pass it onto a supervisor. It's almost 6am and I can still hear her she's just not being as violent as before so I'm assuming no one came out to see her during the night. \n\nWhat else can I do? I've gone three days without any sleep, can't sit in my own home because of her behaviour, and no one seems to care. ",

The furthest I ever went was me saying I feel very alone, but even then I didn't actually say much. \n\nI 100% acknowledge I have problems, and I guess recently they've been getting worse? The weird thing is, I'm a lot more content than I was before - if you compare my \"happiness\" between now and a year ago, I'd say I'm happier now, yet my mental health feels worse. \n\nI guess the big thing which has been causing me the most problem as of recent are my bad panic / anxiety attacks (or at least that's what I think they are). They'll come on randomly throughout the day, at school, at night, while doing homework - and my chest will suddenly feel super tight and it'll feel like everything is caving in on me and the feeling is inescapable.\n\nMy main question is - is it worth getting help as a teenager? Getting help as a teen is messy, and mental health services for teenagers are awful and very intrusive. It feels as though your right to choose is taken away completely. I had bad experiences previously, and I don't want a repeat of that. \n\nAm I better off waiting a year and a bit? Or is it just going to be as bad as before. \n\nThanks in advance.\n^^",

I'm trying to at home but I keep getting triggered all the time. A couple days ago my friend really really hurt me and caused a split and that was horrific and I'm barely keeping it together honestly scared something bad is going to happen.

If I should really try to fight to see the home treatment team and explain going into a crisis house would be helpful. Or if I just have unrealistic expectations of a crisis house and would just waste my time. (Know it's not a quick fix not looking for anyone to magically save me).

I have another review in January.\n\nSince the increases, and honestly since starting Sertraline at all (about 9 months ago) I have felt worse.

I’m just not sure of the best way to go about it, I feel like I can’t just ask but if I don’t ask how can I get help?

I’m still recovering, and my doctors have confirmed that I’m fit to work, but only for 4 hours a day for the foreseeable future to manage my health.\n\nDespite this, my employer claims they don’t have any roles suitable for me with the 4-hour limit. They’ve also placed me in an ill-health capability process and have already issued a first warning, which could eventually lead to my termination.

This excludes sedation, as I have learnt how distressing and traumatic the process is.\n\nBecause of this, I've become worried that there are more subtle things that can lead to an awful experience that I'm not privy to, and wanted to ask if anyone was comfortable sharing said experiences so I can be more cautious myself and also to help develop my practice.

Im now 24. Symptoms experienced:\nemotional dysregulation - i am NOT depressed, I just have depressive episodes, sometimes I can feel on top of the world.\nvery sensitive\nalso sensitive to rejection/abandonment \npoor sleep\ncan get overwhelmed \n\nlist goes on \n\nbeen to the gp multiple times, never helped so i started paying for my own therapy. found this really helpful, felt good to let everything out to someone each week who was validating my feelings. wasn’t really helping with my issues of being sensitive, emotional lows and highs etc. Still feeling suicidal on the regular. \n\nIm not 100% sure what I want, I think I would like some kind of assesment, so that I can find out what really is going on and then hopefully adapt therapy/help to suit my needs, and finally make some progress in my life. Or, because a doctor is there to point patients in the right direction and help them, im open to them telling me what could be best. Everytime i walk out of the gp I feel worse than I did when I was going in and i leave with receiving no help or progress. \n\nwhat can i do or say so that they finally help me tomorrow? \n",

I won’t go into detail, but it wasn’t really a great time. Crisis came out that night. \n\nThey seemed very kind and friendly. The woman told me she looked at my notes and saw I’d been involved in the services since I was 12 (I’m now 27) and it’s about time I got some therapy. She told me she would push hard for the mental health care team to give me a CPN. It seemed great. They were here for over an hour. \n \nThe next day I had a phone call, which wasn’t really that helpful. \n\nThe second day I had a visit from them again. She continued to assure me she would get me an emergency psychiatrist appointment met as my next one wasn’t until March- alongside a CPN and therapy. \n\nToday, well. \n\nThe woman asked me how I was feeling, I went on to say “still pretty horrific.” The woman told me basically that they were discharging me. She said she’d send an email advising the mental health care team give me a CPN etc. This was confusing because I’d been promised and promised that they would make sure this would happen. \n\nI asked about the emergency psychiatrist appointment as my next one isn’t until March. They said she didn’t know if that would happen. I have a lot of mentally unwell family members, I know from much experience that crisis can sort emergency psychiatrist appointments. \n\nShe was here 8 minutes. \n\nI now feel so deflated and defeated. I said to the woman, I don’t see the point in anything anymore, and she ignored it and told me they were palming me off lol. \n\nI’ve struggled for a long time, man. I’ve been in crisis before and they were shit but not THIS shit and for me, this has been the most intense time (in regard to how I was feeling.)\n\nI sent them a text saying I wasn’t happy and they rang me back twice- I missed the calls. \n\nDo I have any options here? Is there anyway for me to get more support? I’ve struggled for a very long time and I don’t want much. I can’t afford to pay privately for therapy but I desperately need it to something that’s in the works for when I’m stable. I would also like a CPN just so I can see someone more regularly than my psych. I don’t want tonnes and tonnes and tonnes. I just want to be able to live somewhat normally. ",

    "selftext": "I’m struggling with severe mental health issues that have deeply impacted my daily life and ability to function. About four months ago, I had a major mental breakdown that triggered intense anxiety and panic attacks. To manage these, I began taking antidepressants. During this time, I’ve also completely isolated myself from social interactions, except for my partner, who has been my only support.\n\nShe has taken on full responsibility for caring for me. She does the shopping, ensures I maintain my hygiene, prepares my meals, and makes sure I don’t skip medications. I can only leave the house if she’s with me, as going out alone triggers severe anxiety and panic attacks, leaving me paralyzed. This has been one of the most difficult periods of my life, especially because, before this, I was an extroverted and positive person who always went the extra mile for others, even while facing personal struggles.\n\nThe cause of my mental health issues stems from years of exposure to toxic environments. I spent over a decade in workplaces where I experienced physical and emotional bullying, harassment, and a lack of support from HR and management. When I reported incidents, they were often swept under the rug, or I was ignored, targeted, or even punished for speaking out. The situation was worse when the bullies were supervisors or company owners, as nothing was ever done to address their behavior.\n\nAdding to this, my brother has repeatedly spoken about ending his life, even setting deadlines for it, which caused me enormous emotional stress. These combined factors have left me feeling hopeless, useless, and completely burned out. I’ve lost interest in everything I once enjoyed, such as video games, meditation, and outdoor activities. Only recently have I started playing video games again, but it’s the only activity I can manage or enjoy right now. I feel disconnected from people, society, and the world as a whole.\n\nDespite thinking time might heal these wounds, I still struggle daily with my mental health. I’m entirely dependent on my partner for basic tasks, and I’m incredibly grateful for her unwavering support, especially since she asks for nothing in return.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSeeking Advice on Financial Support:\n\nWe live in Scotland, and I’m looking for information about financial benefits or support for my partner, as she is my full-time caregiver. She works 35 hours a week, but English is not her strong suit, making it difficult for her to navigate these systems.\n\nSpecifically, I’d like to know:\n\nWhat benefits or financial assistance might she be eligible for through Universal Credit?\n\nIf I’m confirmed as mentally disabled by a professional, how might this affect her eligibility or the amount she could receive?\n\nRoughly, how much support could she expect to get weekly as my caregiver?\n\n\nI appreciate any advice or resources anyone can provide to help us navigate this challenging time.\n\n",

I wouldnt mind it that much however its getting worse and it is very important for me to be very productive in my current stage of life (as i am very focused on education) and fast because what i do now impacts my future. \n\nI do not feel like any of my issues are very very terrible( even if it sounds like it???) but they have developed to a point where they are harmful to my effectiveness. \n\nSome of my issues are:\n1. Intense lack of motivation and interest - both task related and mundane things(very unusual for me) I completely understand the worth of everything i do  but no matter how much i reason with myself it doesnt help.\n\n\n2.(Sounds very silly, sorry) i feel really empty and numb, often really really upset and i honestly cant remember the last time i felt happy, even if something good happened to me its like putting cotton candy in water i have no idea how to describe this sorry.\nI am highly irritable to everything, i do not snap or show it  but i really feel this big anger in my chest even when something small happens and i just want to scream but i always stay calm and kind - i dont have any problems with controling myself but i really dont like this anger. \n\n3.I know its narcissistic and shallow but i have developed this very sudden and random hatred towards how i look and act.\nI have eating issues - i intentionally starve myself often or othervise i feel very guilty and unproductive.\nWhen i eat i eat very healthy - a lot of fibers, balanced proteins carbs and lipids but no matter how much i balance/limit what i eat i just look very chubby, especially in my face.\nI feel very disgusting and dirty so i try to wash myself a lot (my hands have wounds from washing them often) and i had some arguments with my parent because of it but i cant help it. Plus i cant ask(/buy on my own) any self care producs besides soaps(which i now have a limit on) and shampoos.\nSilly, but despite being a girl i really want to be more feminine and do feminine things but i dont have any (like any) feminine clothes, products and at this point i dont even look female and its kind of making me sad. \n\n4. I dont have anyone to talk to - my only relative is my parent who i am in a very good relationship with but honestly i would much rather just bare it than tell them because oh my god no. I dont have any friends at the moment and i am not sure i can make any at all, but i would describe myself as sociable and extrovert  its just that i cant really physically talk to anyone due to some circumstances i wont get into.\n\n\nI know self diagnoses are  harmful so i stay away from them but it would be really nice how to fix at least some stuff and possibly as fast as i can.\n\nI cannot speak to any school staff because it will probably be told to my parent and  anything i say will be in some record that will cause more problems.\nI live in the UK in a remote area and i am also a minor so i cant really go to therapy or even suggest it because my parent will know plus, i am afraid the information will stay somewhere and i wont get the education im aiming for.\n\nMeditation, journalling, walking outside, new hobbies, new diets, self therapy dont work.\n\nI understand that well im asking for something possibly unreal and im ok with just  trying to press on and force myself through it no matter what but if anyone really has any, even minor advice with anything, olease share it.\n\nThank you for reading and i hope you have a very nice day :)\n\nTLDR - perpetually sad mood, emotional irritation, possible(?)

No offer of help and the 16 year old jumped up and walked out the hospital 'hoping to get hit by a bus and d*e'. They did manage to get her home though. \n\nBefore A&E they had already spent around 5 hours trying to get her home from being on a freezing street - trying to stop her hurting herself - and eventually called an ambulance.\n\nPolice contacted the mom in the night, I assume re Safeguarding, but what can they do to help their daughter be correctly assessed? She is being watched 24/7 and essentially they have to try and keep her under house arrest but what help is her mom supposed to try and get? \n\nShe is under camhs though struggles to attend appointments, refuses medication or food, crisis team have been no assistance in the past. A&E have just made  things worse. \nHer daughter isn't looking for help or agreeable as she just wants to d*e.\n\nThey do have an understanding GP but can't speak to her until Monday, and what could the GP even do? In my experience they've only been able to send a referral for camhs... last time she contacted crisis team they told her to do some colouring with her daughter..\n\nThey have no chance now of getting the daughter back to A&E and after the attitude toward her last night it's clearly not helpful.\n\nAny suggestions please?

Now my brother lives with my dad because he hasn't been able to get work & is receiving benefits. He volunteers twice a week at a local aircraft museum (military aircraft is his thing). He is finding it difficult to get work due to refusing to drive.  He can drive but dislikes it & refuses to get a job that includes driving or staying away. He & my dad do odd jobs (building maintenance etc) round the village & everyone talks very highly about him as a person & the quality of his work but he won't do anything on his own volition, it's only if he is told what he has to do.\n\nI found out today from my dad that not only does my brother not wash it sounds like he is recycling the clothes he wears without washing them as he never has any washing for my dad. When you walk past his room, the smell from it is pungent.\n\nAfter mum died, the couple who lived next door to my dad (and were the paramedics who tried to save mum) helped my brother tidy is house. They removed almost 30 bin bags of rubbish from the house & washed his curtains etc (he's a heavy smoker). Since he has moved in with my dad he just sits in his bedroom on his computer only leaving it to go to the museum or any work with dad. He is up all night, even when he did work.\n\nMy dad is 75 & we are both worried about what will happen to my brother when my dad dies. He will still be able to stay in the house but will have bills etc to pay & I know that won't happen because he never opens his mail or takes phonecalls from numbers he doesn't know.\n\nI feel he needs to see a doctor or psychiatrist to find out what's going on with him so we can make plans but I am really nervous about approaching him about it incase he kicks off.  Is it my business to try & help him or should I butt out if he doesn't think there's a problem??\n\nTIA ",

In my city there are three places that do low cost or free therapy (obviously on paper the NHS has more than just therapy, but it's harder to get into). Can you use it as evidence for anything?\n\nIt actually seems like the best approach is to assume there is no help, and then do everything with the mindset of \"no help is available\" and get to work under the assumption you don't have any help, rather than the learned helplessness and external locus of control of hoping for any help  or thinking \"maybe I should wait and then I'll get help\". Eg don't hope there's help for housing, but start looking at getting rid of possessions and how to survive homelessness by any means necessary, rather than the fairy tale NHS narratives. Or reading psychological self-help books as much as possible and accept that you'll do your own therapy, rather than not doing that because you're waiting for therapy to happen and for therapists to tell you what do and what order to do it in.\n\nImagine if the people who first moved to America, or the people who did the French Revolution, or MLK Jr, had hoped for government services to help them? They'd have achieved nothing in life. They assumed they needed to do things themselves and became/stayed resourceful and strong.",

I have gone through all services in my area and am now at a point where primary care cannot help me due to my issues being too complex for them, however, secondary care are refusing my referal due to having already done DBT with them in the past and used all options they can provide me. I now have no idea where to turn. I have been using charity based support groups via zoom to tire me over but I am really struggling, I've realised they don't offer trauma therapy in my area and the support and therapy they have for personality disorders and complex ptsd is limited. (Already Completed a 2 year intensive DBT in 2022 which seems to be the only treatment/therapy available for BPD ). I really don't know what else to do. I went to see my GP today to ask for advice and all she is able to do is send forward yet another referal to secondary care which I am not hopeful about. I know the nhs is under a lot of pressure and there have been cuts across the board but I don't understand how leaving someone with no support isn't a safe guarding issue. I am not currently in crisis but I have been over this period of time not being under a CMHT, and even then they refuse me. I don't want to end up in a severe crisis with no support and would like to move forward in my \"mental health journey\" instead of moving backwards. I know I need trauma therapy as it WAS part of my treatment plan after DBT before that service was defunded and right now I'm in need of more work for emotion regulation.. it's like they expect DBT to act as a cure and because I've done that they expect me to just be \"better\".. is there anything else I can do to get the help I need or am I going to have to go private? A quick Google tells me for specialised therapy privately it will be around £250 per session.. trying to cover all avenues before it comes to that because I am not in a monetary situation to afford that.

I went into detail about my lack of social relationships, isolated and shut-in nature and general apathy, listlessness and lack of ambition in life. This has been a consistent pattern for me for the last 15 or so years and is not something I would easily attribute to depression or anxiety. I have tried both CBT and SSRIs in the past but didn't find either to be helpful. The latter was only citalopram, so perhaps that route could be pursued more, but regardless.\n\nThey phoned back the day after and said based on what they saw I didn't match the profile for any personality disorder, that it was \"just my personality\", and that they wouldn't be continuing with any other sessions. They might refer some recommendations back to my GP from my understanding, although they didn't really say what that meant.\n\nI resisted the urge to argue since I knew I would become belligerent, but I really have to question the fact that I pretty much flatly said that I am apathetic about everything in life, have no friends and such to not be a cause for concern. It honestly made me think that the only reason they might take me seriously is if I said that I self-harm or was suicidal (which I made sure to say that I was not, because I am not). Perhaps I do not have a personality disorder (although I am still doubtful), but I honestly believed that what I said might be concerning enough for it to be worthy of further support. Am I just completely misunderstanding what such services are for?\n\nI have to admit, I am feeling rather \"unhelped\" right now, and it has definitely made me feel worse - don't know what I should do now. Do I have other options, or am I being unreasonable?\n\nThank you in advance.",

    "selftext": "I'm 28, F, have had panic attacks and generalised anxiety since I was 18. Typically the former triggers the latter (i.e. after a period of good mental health, I will have a huge panic attack that usually ends up lasting a full day or longer in waves, and suffer from anxiety for weeks after, then eventually recover for a few weeks before the cycle continues).\n\nA difficulty for me and seemingly the NHS's mental health system has been that my panic attacks don't seem to have one specific root cause - I have had a panic attack triggered simply by a routine work team Zoom call, but I have also had panic attacks triggered by agoraphobia and feeling far from home. But then, that doesn't always happen. I recently went on a work trip, alone, and managed a whole week very far (12 hr flight!) from home, chatted to lots of new people and felt great. Then randomly a few weeks after I returned, I started getting panic attacks from very minor situations, like my boss messaging me. I had a LOT of trauma growing up, with an alcoholic and emotionally abusive parent, which I am sure has played a role in my panic and anxiety somehow. \n\nThere are some situations in which propranolol is very helpful - e.g. it stops me having panic attacks while driving or giving presentations. But sometimes my panic attacks come out of leftfield and are so severe that I have to go home and just lie in the dark or call in sick to work, which I hate doing. \n\nOver the last 10 years, I've seen various GPs countless times for this recurring problem, and I've had four rounds of CBT - none of which were at all useful. I've taken sertraline, venlafaxine, mirtazapine and most recently fluoxetine, but I have really bad side effects and feel even worse on these meds. Even the sertraline and venlafaxine, which I managed to stay on for more than a few months for each, didn't help. They all give me insomnia and make me feel like I'm going crazy.\n\nI recently spoke to my doctor and she basically said that if SSRIs and CBT don't work for me, there is NOTHING the NHS can do to help me. She asked if I have tried exercising, which is a joke because I'm a competitive runner, so yes, I exercise a lot. I've tried cutting out caffeine,  alcohol, mindfulness, yoga.. everything. \n\nThe only thing that has ever helped me in a meaningful way is benzos, but for understandable reasons the NHS refuses to prescribe them anymore. When I was younger it was possible to get a short-term prescription for when I was really struggling, but this seems to have been completely phased out since around 2019.\n\nI don't understand what more I can do, or how I can get my GP to progress me to a specialist or something. HOW do we have a system where I've been told that SSRIs and CBT are the ONLY option and if they don't work, I'm on my own? Does anyone have any resources or experience with this that might help?",

    "selftext": "So just over 6 weeks ago my mum had a really strange episode where she was wandering around the house, hysterical, sobbing, incoherent, angry, shouting, getting in and out of my bed because she felt she couldn't breathe (this isn't normal for us we aren't touchy people) she does have quite severe asthma so wasn't sure if this was \"real\" or anxiety driven. She refused ambulance/a&e and I didn't know what to do. This happened for about 4 days on the run... mainly at night and she was barely eating during this time.\n\nA week on from the first instance I persuaded/insisted she needed a doctor and we went to the GP. \n\nGP diagnosed mixed anxiety and depressive disorder and prescribed sertraline, as well as telling her to refer for online CBT. \n\nShe started the sertraline and was eating liminal food amounts, however it has now been 5 weeks on Tuesday since she has eaten anything of substance. As in in that time she has had 2 pots of jelly and a smoothie, maybe a half a yoghurt. Not each day but total. She says she is nauseous and physically cannot eat without vomiting and around 2 weeks ago for 5 days couldn't even keep water down, yet still refused medica help at this time.\n\nShe is a functioning alcoholic however after the period of time not being able to keep down water she was also unable to keep down wine and hasn't drank a drop since (no side effects weirdly) \n\nBasically, I have no idea what I can do in this situation. \n\nI live with her, I can see her going downhill every single day without food but she is refusing help, she got an appointment with the doctors on Friday and he prescribed her anti sickness tablets to help her eat, she's eaten a single pot of jelly since... \n\nI am pretty sure I know the answer is that there is nothing I can do and I am doomed to watch her slowly kill herself by starvation, but on the off chance there is anything I can do I am here for advice. \n\nShe has been completely \"fine\" since we originally went to the doctors as in no hysteria, crying, wandering, being incoherent whatsoever.\n\nOh and she signed up for the online CBT but hasn't engaged with the programme whatsoever. \n\nI've told her how dangerous what she is doing is and she just shrugs me off. I am utterly emotionally drained by the whole thing and she seems oblivious to this/doesn't care that I am watching her fade away.",

    "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI’ve been backwards and forwards to my gp over the last year trying to address my mental health. I’m at a point now where I have tried 3 anti depressants and did a course of talking therapy over the summer. The last 3 months have been very rough with trialling different meds. CMHT first rejected me 2 months ago and told me to try talking therapy again. Talking therapy rejected me and said they can’t offer me anything as they think I’m too severe for their services, and said they were going to write up a report and send back to CMHT. They also referred me to MIND but the option I got from them was a 9 month wait for counselling with a trainee. My GP said that he can’t help me anymore as he’s exhausted all his options and that he would be referring me to CMHT and to speak to the mental health nurse at the practice who would be dealing with it. I’ve also had a couple of calls with 111 after experiencing some side effects and unpleasant thoughts, they also said they would be referring me to the CMHT. \n\nThat brings me to yesterday when I met with my mental health nurse at my GP practice, who has told me that the CMHT have rejected me again and have told me I need to try another med and basically put up with any side effects and optimise the dose, aswell as taking up minds option of a 9 month wait for counselling with a trainee. To say I’m feeling let down and hopeless is putting it lightly. \n\nI’ve spent this past year basically as a vegetable unable to look after myself as I’m so severely anxious and depressed. I’ve suffered with mental health for over 20 years and nothing so far has helped me. I’ve requested several times to see a psychiatrist which the doctors have agreed to, but then the CMHT just keep rejecting me.\n\nI’m not sure what else I’m supposed to do and I’m slowly loosing all hope to the point where the only way I can get some proper help is if I turn up at A&E.\n\nIf I wasn’t currently going to a men’s suicide prevention charity who have been great but I only have a couple of sessions left, I really don’t know what I would do.\n\nAny guidance or support would be great.

I had times where I would be able to get out of bed but while walking to work one time i stopped near a river and all I wanted to do was end my life. \n\nI had another time in 2020 where i experienced a very high mood, I’m unsure of the length of it but I remember it lasting a while (weeks perhaps). My main concerns were feeling jittery/drugged up, things appeared more saturated/brighter, I got really interested in spirituality and was seeing ‘signs’ everywhere, I thought people were NPCs & were ‘placed there’, I believed we were in a simulation, frantic cleaning early hours of the night. \nI have experienced high moods since then but nothing like the one I experienced in 2020, during that same year I experienced several occasions where I felt ‘high’ and out of control & I would find myself deep cleaning during early hours & excessively posting to social media. \n\nIn 2022, my nan became unwell and was only given a few months to live. This lead me to quit my job of 2 years (I wanted to quit anyway it was toxic). After my nan passed away, my mood lifted a lot. I applied for my ‘dream’ job at the time, I took up influencing and spent almost every single day waking up early, emailing brands to work with them, going out alone to take outfit photos for social media (I would not usually do this I would be too embarrassed). When I wasn’t doing this, I would go on nights out with friends and drink a lot & do ❄️.  Around the same time, I convinced myself that someone had hexed me because there were lots of flies in my sisters bedroom (wtf was I thinking lol). \n\nThe same year, I was prescribed fluoxetine because I then crashed and was really feeling the effects of my nan passing away. Looking back, this was another depressive episode following a period of what I would describe as hypomania. \nOne month into fluoxetine, I felt like I was becoming depressed again so I contacted my GP who then upped my dosage. It worked and stopped again after a while and this kept happening until May 2023 so I decided to stop them cold turkey. I have noticed my moods haven’t been shifting as frequently as they were on when I was on the antidepressants but since stopping them, I have been smoking weed daily to make me feel more spaced out. \n\nI have had episodes since May where I have felt very depressed that have lasted around 7 days each time (I had a depressive episode in sept which lasted 3 weeks & it was HORRIBLE). I have also had episodes of high moods since May that have lasted around 5 days at most each time & during episodes my moods are persistent & are not usually triggered (I know one trigger but that’s all). \n\nI decided to self refer to NHS talking therapies and they said they couldn’t help me as I was showing signs of cyclothymia and possibly bipolar disorder so I went back to my GP who then referred me to the community mental health team for an assessment. The assessment took place today 3/11/24 and I was not happy with the outcome at all. They told me to go back to counselling which I had already been to, they said the counselling will help the depression. They also said my moods are slightly elevated & to stay off of my antidepressants but because my high moods aren’t causing any issues they aren’t concerned. They said that I’m still young (23) and I’m still trying to regulate my emotions. \n\nI don’t know where to go from here, I feel misunderstood. I feel as if I am taking this too seriously and I’m making it something way bigger than it is. I just need clarification from a professional so I can find the right medication and help. \n\nIf anyone has any advice please let me know as I would appreciate it so much. \n\n\n",

Long story short, i've struggled with mental health for many years now but have recently finally taken some steps to address is through CBT sessions provided through my works PHC. The issue I have is that my performance at work hasn't been great recently, and I've not been entirely honest with how I'm progressing with several projects I currently work on. I'm concerned that when I \"come clean\" to my employer that i'll lose my job, and subsequently lose the support that I've just started to receive. I've got so much work to do on myself to get to a point where I'm happy with who I am, but im concerned that now I've finally made the decision to seek help that it'll be taken away from me in the process. (Or at least made a lot harder). I don't know what to do, I need to make some changes but fear that I'll lose my job and future opportunities by doing so. I know that I'm super fortunate to be able to access private medical care, and appreciate the NHS is available for people who aren't so lucky. However I know the waiting lists are long and I dont know how i'd cope without being able to access mental health services as easily as I currently can. Any advice or guidance would be appreciated as I feel like im at a loss.\n\nThanks for reading, and I hope you all have a nice evening.",

Been told they don't really know what to do if I won't see this person as they're short staffed. \n\nCan they discharge me for this? \n\nFull story-ish. There's too much to include everything and some things won't be allowed to be mentioned on here.\n\nI was originally referred in June 23 for postpartum depression. Rocky start then from September 23 to July this year I had a good cpn, then had someone else as she went on maternity leave. My new cpn then went off sick in September and I was left with no plan in place. \n\nI'm pregnant and struggling a lot. I'm suicidal, self harming, struggling to eat/sleep and dealing with poor care from both maternity and mental health teams. I have a history of suicide attempts and been off anti-depressants since July/August. \n\nMy OB sent a letter to the CMHT at the beginning of October stating concern for my mental health after an appointment with him where I said something he found concerning (two other professionals are aware of what I had said too but still nothing was done.) \n\nI finally got given someone new on 25/10. An appointment letter was issued on 31/10 for an appointment another two weeks away on 13/11. \n\nThat appointment then got cancelled the morning of. \n\nIt got rearranged for the following week, 21/11 as a home visit and it went bad. Really bad. \n\nI kicked this woman out after 2 minutes. She arrived late. I was already feeling really let down by having that first appointment cancelled after spending two weeks thinking I was finally getting help. Then the first thing she brought up was the OB letter, so basically rubbing it in how long they'd been aware I needed help. \n\nI told her that that was over a month ago and she just made a face which basically set me off. They knew for weeks how bad things were but nothing was sorted. \n\nI had a pretty bad breakdown and told her to leave. \n\nI missed a call at some point from her and the voicemail left was asking for a different patient then laughing until the call ended... (issues with my phone gave no date/time for this call so I honestly don't know if it was before or after my app on the 21st.) \n\nShe finally got back in touch with me today (3/12) offering an appointment with her at the CMHT office. Told her not with her and explained why when she asked. She then said they're at a loss of what to do because they're short staffed and don't have many female staff so if I won't see her there's not much they can do. \n\nCan they really do that? Just not give me care because I won't speak to one specific person? I've never said I won't see a male member of staff so not sure if that's a thing they do, assigning a cpn the same gender or if someone's just using it as an excuse. \n\nI've hit crisis point a few times since September and I'm struggling. I have a lot of unresolved trauma from baby 1 which isn't helping anything as there has not been adequate support specifically with trauma (despite being told there would be soon - this was back in April...)

Throughout my life, i've been on again and off again with the medication, going through phases of thinking i need it versus phases when I didn't.\n\nWhen I was a student at uni, I made the decision to go back on it. However, because my childhood diagnosis was from the US, the NHS wouldn't recognise it. In 2019, I went to a Harley Street practice and got a private diagnosis, confirming that I had quite strong ADHD.\n\nI then went to my GP and asked for a Shared Care Agreement. They denied that this was something that existed, so I made the decision to join Babylon at Hand. I spoke to a GP via their app and they agreed to a shared care agreement and I started receiving my medication on the NHS. All good until here.\n\nI then left the UK and moved to Europe to start a new job. I then decided to try and finally come off the medication for good and tried to learn how to manage my symptoms without it. This did not work out for me and ever since I have come off the medication, I have struggled with work and focus. I have since moved back to the UK and when I did, I registered with a phsyical GP again (partly because Babylon was acquired and made a paying service). This is the issue.\n\nWhen I registered with the physical GP, my file was closed at Babylon (now eMed). After losing my last job, I went to see my GP and said I think I need to return to the medication. I still had the private assessment from 2019, but they could not find my SCA.\n\nIt seems that in the transfer, they lost the Shared Care Agreement, and now the new GP won't prescribe me the medication until it is located. I tried calling Babylon to ask them to look for it, but they said for GDPR reasons they can't access my information. So I'm essentially stuck: I have proof that I have ADHD, I have a demonstrable history of receiving the medication, but Babylon won't look and my current GP won't prescribe until I produce the SCA. The only alternative is to go see the private clinic again for a new assessment but that would be quite costly and I'd like to avoid that if. possible. Can anybody recommend what to do ?",

I’m on 20mg citalopram, failed trials of trazodone, duloxetine (w/ quetiapine), fluoxetine, venlafaxine. They said it was unlikely to help but they would try 40mg, now they wont do anything.\n\nMental health struggles started getting really bad devloping OSFED (atypical anorexia + ARFID) in 2022 but only being seen at all for diagnosis in 2023. Waiting for treatment my anxiety and particularly depression grew and we ended up constantly suicidal by the autumn that year, seen to start ED treatment in winter, where all they did was insist we had to eat more, no formulation, plan kept secret, no help to feel like it was a safe choice or there was a point. No nutrition help, etc. then they decided to kick us out with no help instead because we couldn’t just eat more (we communicated the whole time that we wanted to feel able to do that but needed help). Then seen by psychiatry and put on meds that didnt help, (not even sleep, we barely get 3-4h a night), only to keep getting suicidal and told they wouldnt help anymore because I’m unstable. Came off meds, with a ton of weight gained and naturally mentally worse because they didnt help anxiety, lift mood, nothing. I cant keep taking this useless dose that was all the gp would agree to (i despise ssris but am desperate enough to try them) knowing its making this body we hate even hevier and they wont even try the dose that has a hope of helping.\n\nIve been rejected from the cmht for having no diagnosis so psychology isnt an option, psychiatry refuse to see or diagnose us because “its psychology’s problem and you cant be not ok because meds didn’t help”. I need to keep a history of being stable or will be denied essential surgery referral, and was told that means no out of hours calls, no mental health assessment team. Gp only. I feel awful and need some hope to put in to stop myself deteriorating back into suicidal like before there was hope - people trying to help is whats been keeping me going but I’m shut away from any options, physically disabled and need the little i can work for and ADP just to survive with the physical conditions. Besides private services just say i need a crisis team rather than helping, there is no crisis team in edinburgh, and ive made it this long without one and without any help, so clearly we dont need one, we need someone to actually diagnose and treat us.\n\nI dont know what to do, we cant give up hope or we’ll be back at our worst.

But basically I am in poor mental health at the moment, have felt symptoms becoming bad again building up the last couple months & like I have been this position enough times in past to know when it's about to cross that line of not being I control. \n\nI live with my parents & whilst, generally speaking, we get along and I can just about cope being here when my health is good this is a terrible environment for me to be in when it's bad. It is nothing they are doing directly towards me. Difficult to explain exactly without going into my life story and history lol. But they are constantly arguing every day shouting at each other, calling each other names, blaming each other for crap. Hearing conflict between them or even just being in the house and anticipating it is a MAJOR trigger and I'm just like stuck in this state of constant anxiety. Which, times like this, I absolutely cannot cope with it for long. I cannot really talk to them about how it effects me without potentially causing more conflict so like I'm basically just held up in my room whenever I'm not at work. Which ik is also probably not helping... but yk I don't have friends or place to hang out. \nAlso I WORK for my parents :') which I am grateful for. Because of other health condition I struggle to get work and probably be unemployed if not for them. But you can probably imagine hoe this also adds another layer of anxiety in this situation. \n\nAnyway it has been probably about 2 years since my mental health got so bad and my last breakdown. And I am absolutely terrified to experience that again. Not sure exactly what to call it \"breakdown\" but it will begin with anxiety heightened, intrusive thoughts become worse and getting nature of them becoming disturbing, getting strange ideas that I usually won't, suicidal thought etc. I suffered with this a long time so I can catch when it is becoming bad. But after some point I can't manage it and I kinda \"snap\" and become another person (not literally) very unlike myself and behave in ways I cannot control at that time. \nIt is EXTREMELY embarrassing, distressing and causes problems for myself and other people. But I won't really know about it until afterwards if that makes sense? Like I'm still (normal me) present in my mind and witnessing everything but my actions completely controlled by something else. \nI'm not like to hurt people but say horrible things that don't align with my normal beliefs, do stupid things without regard to consequence, put myself in vulnerable situations, harm myself etc.\nCan last for hours, days at time but not (usually) longer. Then any stressor/trigger in the \"cool off period\" can start it up again and prolong this absolute nightmare. I am in the perfect environment for this to happen... and has always in the past. \n\nI am honestly so stressed and anxious anticipating this to happen and I know by that it is making chances of it reaching that point even more but idk what to do. I want to remove myself from this situation BEFORE I reach that point to save people the stress and myself the embarrassment, guilt and shame. But I am literally trapped. I know I need to eventually get myself out of this environment long term for the sake of health but for now, I don't know what I can do for short term. Like I say I don't have anyone else I can stay with. I can afford to possibly stay in hotel or something for a little while but yk, I am not rich and idk how long i will need. Renting is just ridiculous hard for everyone right now never mind if you are low income, health problem or whatever.\n\nI don't know what I can do. Sorry I'm just rambling crap by now.

Ngl when I'm either panicking about an irrational anxiety or washing everything in the house for fear of contamination or feeling depressed because my mind fully believes the bad thing(tm) is happening and this is my fate now, it's really hard to \" just ground yourself\".\n\nI was hoping NHStalking therapies might refer me onto something else, or help me to get to the root of just what is going on under the surface with all this but nope, nothing just bye. I can't really afford to spend £80 a session on private therapy. I feel totally alone, utterly rubbish and pointless as a person, and I really don't see anyway forward with this except to just accept that every month I'm going to lose a week to just total panic and anxiety. :(\n\nHelp a pal out please 🙏 much love",

My doctors don't seem to know much about mental health, and often I'm given appointments with nurse practitioners or physician associate, who have to play Chinese whispers with the doctor. This happened at my last appointment resulting in the physician associate sending me a text saying that they won't be referring me back to psychiatry, and that I needed to use coping mechanisms in the community. This was hugely insulting because I have literally dedicated my life to coping mechanisms. I couldn't have tried any harder to fix myself. I know I need medication because my brain chemicals don't work properly. I'm also on the wait list for an autism diagnosis, and you can't coping mechanism your way out of autism.\n\nSo after a few weeks of sitting with it, going through my options in my head I thought, you know what, I'm not just going to take this lying down. With the help of chatgpt, I wrote a polite but detailed letter explaining everything, and saying that all I want is for either them or psychiatry to advise me on my next medication to try. \n\nI'm sure they'll find a new way to let me down, and if they do, I'll be moving back to my old GP surgery. But I'm glad I sent the letter and stood up for myself. It took bravery and I just hope it pays off. ",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone. I wanted to ask what kind of help I should/can ask for. I'm diagnosed with BPD, BDD, depression and anxiety (and ADHD). I think this times crisis was mostly BPD fueled. A build up of a lot of stuff made me feel really depressed, out of control and the world was out to get me. Messed up my perception of things completely, I did things I wouldn't normally do, seeing and hearing things, felt absolutely crazy and ended up attempting. Before the attempt I told my CMHT (care co-ordinator, support worker and therapist), went to A&E and told pysch liason who then referred me to Home Treatment Team, told them as well as a  crisis cafe nearby, a few helplines and a couple different teams at my university that I felt suicidal, that I had intention, plans and the means to do it. And nobody really did anything.\n\nI don't really want to write it all out as it's too long but home treatment team said they weren't gonna see me and just said to call this helpline that I'd already told them I didn't find helpful. A lot of the conversations I had were just people referring me to other people then them referring me back and going round in circles. I was just sent home each time, told to call someone if I needed help but I'd given up as I'd already called and they told me to go to A&E who told me to call them. So I felt that nobody knew how to help, could help and that everyone would make me feel worse and there was nowhere to turn. I started not to trust healthcare professionals anymore and missed calls and appointments and they didn't follow up to check on me.\n\nI'm grateful I survived my attempt and I've been at my parents house resting and recovering but worried I'll have to go back home soon and I'm really scared as I think there's still a part of me that feels unsafe and I could attempt again. \n\nThe trouble is - a lot of times people have asked me what kind of help do I want, what do I expect? And it's made me feel really bad and lost. I have no idea what would help me. I tried so many times to use distractions and previous coping techniques but it didn't feel helpful for my level of risk. I don't know what I could ask for- does anyone have any advice into figuring out what I can ask for or any suggestions?",

I still have some past traumas to work through a bit. \n\nIn the last year I had a break up of my first real relationship, I've moved from a sunny warm place to one that is much colder and wetter and I am starting a new job in a field I was contemplating quitting due to low motivation/drive. I still suffer from lack of enjoyment of things and low drive - I used to have tons of hobbies and more energy. I don't think about suicide but often see the world/my life as meaningless and dull, struggling to see much reason to continue. \n\nMy GP didn't want to put me on SSRIs immediately but we have been monitoring things for a couple months and they said if I want I can give them a try. I'm generaly quite sceptical of whether the SSRI will help (studies are dubious), and also deathly afraid of all the myriad of side effects. I don't have any issues with sexual function at the moment and I am in pretty decent physical shape, though do get fatigued more easily. \n\nOn one hand it feels like I'm not getting anywhere, that my life and golden years are passing me by and maybe I have been living under a \"shadow\" for so long I don't even know what \"normal\" is. On the other hand my fears and anxieties about side effects and withdrawal stop me from wanting to try the medications. Over the years I have been offered them several times and never wanted to go for them. My understanding was they can be necessary for severe cases with constant suicidal thinking but maybe for mild cases the cost benefit isn't so clear.\n\nI know this is a discussion to have with my doctor, but I've already had several and they are not mandating me to do anything - it's in my hands.  \n\nAny advice or experiences would be great to hear.",

It’s gotten so much worse this week tho, and I don’t know if I can keep doing this.\n\nWe ended up in A&E on Wednesday because he accidentally went too deep and needed the wound to be glued up. Last night I stayed with him for 5 hours because things were so bad he reached out to a crisis line who were no help. He’s been suicidal on and off for our whole friendship but this is the worst I’ve ever ever seen it. I thought things were getting better. I don’t know how to keep doing this.\n\nI finally got him to tell his parents last night. They were going to come see us today but couldn’t because of storms.

But I’m terrified to leave him alone but also don’t want to be at home at all. But if I have to go out I’m terrified to come home.

I'm on vortioxetine 10mg.\n\nI've finally got to the top of the wait list for the psychology team and am 5 sessions in. I've been given weekly sessions and they say the duration is likely 6-12 months. \n\nI am finding the sessions really difficult. When I am waiting for them it feels like there is a fist crushing my heart. During the sessions I struggle a lot. I try and talk but as it goes on I get more and more stressed. Everything around me goes fuzzy and bright and I struggle to say any words at all and the therapist tells me to take some time to calm down and we talk about something else for a bit.\n\nWhen I was 16 I had CBT with CAMHS where I was very antagonistic and didn't want to be there. I refused to talk to the first therapist and they gave me a new one but the first one was still coordinating behind the scenes. I feel guilty about this and about wasting their time. When I am in therapy now I am trying hard to be good and be helpful but I think that makes me more stressed.\n\nIn our last session, my therapist said she had spoken with her supervisor about how I was feeling anxious and they were thinking of giving me art therapy instead but that would be with a different person. I know this isn't what was happening but it felt like I was being kicked out of therapy for being bad. I was crying a lot and when she asked what I would do later I said probably hurt myself because I was thinking about that a lot. She had to get the duty nurse who asked if I could keep myself safe and I said I wasn't planning on killing my self and they said I could go and they would call me later to check in. The session overran by 45 minutes and I was crying for most of it.\n\nI feel very guilty about the whole thing. I'm not against doing art therapy if they think it would be helpful but I feel like I am failing at getting better even though I am trying really hard. \n\nIf anyone has any advice on how to do better at this or how to approach this, or if you have been in a similar situation and can share I would appreciate it ",

    "title": "So, 20 Months later.",
    "selftext": "I've had what I have always been told By the NHS is stress, depression and anxiety. This goes back pretty much all my life. My story is very long and complex and boring to most so I'll try t keep it brief.\n\nMy mental heath started to deteriorate to the level that I couldn't cover it in the mid 1990s. Since then I have sought help from the NHS on numerous occasions. I have always been told it's stress, anxiety and depression. I have been prescribed numerous anti depressants over the years none have ever made me feel better some made me feel worse. Ultimately I stopped taking them, a move I considered to be smart when I recently met up with someone I worked with who had been on anti depressants long term and was addicted to them. Anyway lock down  worsened my mental health and my wife persuaded me to go and see a Doctor again in March last year.   Despite my misgivings I went along to an appointment with my wife. Yea, the Dr was totally useless and I'll qualify that. Basically he ignored what I had to say, spent a considerable amount of time how he raises money for a forces charity, I was in the Army from 1977-1983. Did the usual of wanting to put me on drugs which I declined and topped it off by informing me that he had five other patients to see. He also asked what medication I had been on in the past, I told him that would be on my records and he did have my records? I got a vague answer which prompted me requesting the records after the Medical centre did their best to inconvenience me I finally got them to discover the period from the late 1970s to 2001 were missing. My wife was so appalled by the appointment she complained and we subsequently received an apology from the Doctor and a Practice partner. However this then escalated into a dispute with the office manager.\n\nMy wife had been researching on the internet as we both considered my condition was more than just stress, depression and anxiety. A previous Doctor had noted that he considered I had a \"character flaw\" but my circumstances at that time meant I wasn't able to follow that up. Part of my condition involves self harm normally cutting my arms and I have multiple scars, and also for want of a more accurate term throw a tantrum like a three year old, despite mentioning this on numerous occasions it was just glossed over. It wasn't until I saw a program on Disney + where one of the characters was acting in a similar way to my behaviour in real life I realised it was stimming. Something the NHS has subsequently agreed with. Oh I forgot to mention just after the appointment I had an attack of Bell's Palsy and again in June of this year I had another attack of it. So I'm now awaiting a MRI scan on that issue. \n\nAnyway after the interview and speaking to the mental heath nurse and lots of toing and froing they put me on a \"Wellbeing CBT course\" I did say I believed it would be of no use but I attended the six week course anyway. Wow! So basically it was a badly presented power point presentation by two staff. A third of the attendees had gone by the end. Despite saying they wouldn't call people out that's exactly what they did. The \"progress\" of individuals was supposedly done on a questionnaire before every meeting. The first question, I'd love to meet the genius who thought this one up was Do you wish you had never been born / have you considered suicide along those lines. Now I frequently wish I had never been born but I never have considered suicide. Tick that box and one of the staff would say during the course in front of everyone \"can so and so see me in the break\". I could say so much more about this course but... At the end of the course I had a letter saying, comically that \"I was in recovery\" which wasn't the case at all. \n\nSo them more toing and froing and I was put on a one to one video conference with a \"therapist\" . To start things off I discovered that the NHS software didn't work with open source software and my keyboard made the ultimate sacrifice when I smashed it into many many pieces in frustration. My wife has Microsoft office n her laptop through her work so I eventually had a means of access. Wow! So that lasted three meetings. It became confrontational several  times as I want a diagnosis so I can understand why I do what I do. One of these disagreements came when I was told \"If you get a diagnosis you will have a label and you will have to take medication\" my response was \"I already have a label and I don't have to take medication. On meeting three this then devolved into him personally insulting me. He informed me that \"I had a narrow view and I was living in the past\" I was also informed  that he thought I was \"unburdening myself on him\" Yea right. This and other aspects of how the NHS has treated me e.g. other staff denying comments they had made to me, resulted in a complaint to the local health board, Where of course nothing was upheld and then a complaint to the Ombudsman Where after six Months the outcome was and this will surprise you, not, the NHS did everything perfectly. It didn't surprise me in any way. \n\nSo them it all went quite. In the meantime I attended a ten week series of meeting with MND and I don't have a bad word to say about them. Of course they were not able to give me a diagnosis. One point to note was my score was higher at the end than at the start. Sadly the local branch I attended went into administration in September, apparently they all run as separate units. \n\nAnd then back to the NHS who seemed to have spent the time occasionally sending internal messages around but without talking to me. So then it was time to contact our MP and as if by magic, completely out of the blue and I imagine nothing to do with the MP, two days later I had a phone call from...Yes the NHS. Ok so now I was really going somewhere, oh no hang on I wasn't.\n\nSo I attended the local mental health unit for an assessment . This was followed by them having two meetings. I was then called in for another meeting this time with a \"deputy\" Psychiatrist who for the first time agreed that he considered I have borderline personality disorder possibly mixed with other issues. So then they had three meetings.\n\nI was then contacted by a member of the recovery team about being placed on the waiting list to see a psychiatrist. And then they had a meeting, can you see a pattern emerging here? So anyway on Friday they phoned back and told me the meeting had rejected my request for a diagnosis for BPD, no reason why, and at that moment I had a massive sense of humour failure (because it's an integral trait of my character) and had to hand the phone to my wife. So what they want to do now to waste more time and resources is to send me for an autism assessment. Thing is I don't present any of the traits of autism and I don't think for one second that it's part of my issues.\n\nAnyway I have a meeting on Wednesday where no doubt I won't be the happiest man in the whole of the County where I'm going to request any data held in connection with these meetings (I'd love to know what was said) and unsurprisingly lodge another complaint. Many meetings, not much treatment \n\n",

    "selftext": "So I’m 19f, currently seeing a psychologist through the CMHT after many MANY referrals, most of which have failed so far. This is going well- I’ve had 2 appointments towards my assessment now, which is refreshing cause it’s taken the pressure of having to get EVERYTHING off my chest within the first 60 minutes of me meeting a person. \n\nShe’s given me some homework to do before our final session towards my assessment scheduled next week. Two little questionnaires, and she mentioned for me to think about what I may want to get out of treatment. \n\nNow, I despise this question. Because I don’t know. I don’t know how a not mentally ill mind thinks, works, or interacts with the world. I don’t remember the last time I’ve gone longer than a day without at least passively considering ending my life. I’ve built a large part of my identity and self image over being mentally ill, my mind is literally carved with childhood trauma. Like, the answer seems obvious- I want to feel not shit about basically everything that’s ever happened, will happen, could possibly happen, will not happen, or that I dare to say, do, think, etc… ETC… But I know the coping strategies, I know how to live with the poison in my mind, I know some of my coping mechanisms are unhealthy, I know what to replace them with- but, like, when I think of implementing any of the stuff I’ve learnt in past attempts at counselling of various sorts, I feel like I’m falling. It’s a constant and never ending uphill battle to keep myself safe from myself and I think I may throw something if one more person suggests “oh, just do xyz coping strategy” like, that’s easy to say when you can’t recognize your own face in the mirror cause your mind is so distorted from the breakdown you’re having currently because your housemate had a slightly harsh tone of voice earlier today- or whatever bs my mind decides to play up at any given moment. \n\nLike, I genuinely do not know how to answer the question. My mind is at a blank. It makes me want to not go to the appointment because I just don’t know what to say so I don’t feel like I’m wasting her time or smth. \n\nIdk, this was mostly a rant. I feel like I’m suffocating when I try to come up with something. Any advice is appreciated ",

During this time I was given the diagnosis of EUPD based on no assessment and just my presentation at the time of admission, which was clearly during crisis.\nAfter discharged I told my care-co that this didn’t seem fitting and she agreed that my symptoms align more with bipolar or psychotic depression, thankfully she has requested a second opinion.\nMy question is has anyone had any luck in having an EUPD diagnosis over turned? Also, should I expect another period of monitoring for a bipolar diagnosis? \nDoes anyone have any advice on what the psychiatrist might want to know and how I should prepare?\nThank you :)",

Part of the crisis care plan was to go straight to A&E if I am at the point where I feel like harming myself(no way i would) or having suicidal thoughts (I want help bad enough to the point where I have considered) and one time recently the voices got to the point where I was breaking down with intense sad feelings and couldnt focus on anything, dissociating and badly needed to go to the hospital to get help other than telling my mother what happened, but she constantly said all they will do is just keep me waiting and tell me what she is telling me which is try calming techniques and playing white noise or some shit but I know if i tell them what is going on it will be bad enough to section me.\n\nI am also in under 25s substance team having appointments every week and the most recent one I told them about the recent break down and she said that I need to go because they will have the crisis team always on standby to get me the help I need and even push forward my already urgent referral.\n\nThis is where the suicidal thoughts are turning into intentions. I want to overdose but not die. I dont care about the side effects in my mind it is the only thing that can get me the help I so desperately need. But the only reason I havent is because I dont want to wake up my mum and have my dad hear the conversationbecause of the type of personality I try to show infront of him. I dont want to seem like a weak person infront of him. I dont want to irritate my mother by waking her up and fucking up her work making her cancel clients.\n\nCAMHS hasnt reached out to me although the lady doing my inital assessment was great and very understanding of all the problems I was having being great overall and I would really like to have the ability to send a text saying I desperately need help. \n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated as I do not want to feel this way but have a will strong enough to realise that if I don't then I might just get the help I need and to stop full blown suicidal thoughts in their tracks.\n\nThanks for taking your time to read this I appreciate it <3",

I've been in the NHS mental health system for almost a decade now. \n\nFor context, I've got an alphabet soup of diagnoses but the key one being CPTSD that is increasingly causing more and more chaos in my life. I have been told by several mental health professionals in the past that objectively, I need EMDR due to the extensive trauma in my life.\n\nI've tried to obtain therapy from the NHS but this is how it has gone so far: \n\n- CBT with a therapist in one area, he discharged me after two sessions after getting frustrated that I have made no progress. CBT didn't come close to touching on the issues.\n- CBT with another therapist, this time a trainee, she objectively didn't have enough experience to help me, unfortunately.\n- Was referred to another therapist but moved out of area, had to be re-referred.\n- Been passed around from pillar to post for many years, passed to a CMHT eventually where I got passed from crisis to psych to crisis. \n- Eventually had therapy with the CMHT, completely wrong type of therapy given if I remember correctly, had to be referred out\n- Was then passed to TWO more trainees, who were not effective\n- Was passed to Stage 2, then Stage 3, then Stage 3+, I was about to get EMDR, I then moved area as I was priced out and I was no longer able to attend especially as a physically disabled person and the trust refused to make reasonable adjustments \n\nI am genuinely at my wits' end and I face yet another re-referral into the system in yet another different trust. I'm convinced at this point that the mental health teams are filled with a few admin staff and a few students and no one else, and I have had some absolutely horrific admin  experiences that have actually left me more traumatised and too scared to interact with the NHS, as well as experiences from mental health nurses.\n\nIs there a route that I can take within the NHS that acknowledges that I've been waiting for the last 10 years or so for therapy? Patient Choice? Complaints? I'm genuinely unsure what path to take at this point, and I'm at the point where I've been so suicidal and yet in full knowledge of the fact A&E will do nothing and having to discharge myself from ambulances when members of the public call one, as it's actually pointless to wait for 16 hours and then be sent home. \n\nI post this despite at this point getting full blown flashbacks of NHS workers being abusive every time I see an NHS mental health letter, I honestly don't want to fight the system, I have been doing this for a decade, I just want to feel better :(\n\nIs there a chance of me getting anywhere with the NHS or should I assume private is the only option at this point? \n\n",

I have been really struggling to sleep since I started living alone which has had a negative effect on my already declining mental health. When I do manage to sleep I can't sleep through the entire night because my neighbour always wakes me up. \n\nThings have been bad with this neighbour since I moved in. First she kept sitting right outside my front door smoking cannabis which made me home stink. She's stopped smoking cannabis there now but she still sits right outside my front door and refuses to move when I'm trying to get in or out. \nThe next thing she did was flood my bathroom. She often overfills her bath and I end up with water coming through the ceiling. It's happened six times in nine months and has caused damage to the ceiling and my floor. \n\nThe worst thing though is the amount of shouting, hitting things, and slamming doors. When I first moved in I thought what I was hearing could be domestic abuse but I've since learned from other neighbours that my upstairs neighbour struggles with schizophrenia. At least once a week I hear her shouting and swearing, repeatedly slamming doors, throwing things etc. This probably sounds really selfish because it definitely seems like she is struggling but I can't deal with much more of it. I'm anxious enough as it is and listening to her is frightening and it makes me even more anxious. In the past I've tried calling 111 but as I don't know her they were unable to do anything (she's completely ignored all of my attempts to talk to her like when I tried to introduce myself etc.) I've called the police when it sounds like she's being violent but she refuses to answer the door to them.

The ward doctor says they’ve done every test so there’s nothing else they can do for me for why I’m having fevers nearly every single day. Only test they’ve done is for WBC and CRP. I’m restricted from seeing my own GP, I’m lectured for making dental appointments even if I’ve had a tooth infection. I go to staff and say I’m having a fever and they go “you seem fine so you’re not”. I’ve had to bring my own thermometer from home just to prove I’ve been having fevers but I’m treated like it’s all in my head because I have anxiety. Of course I’m anxious if no one’s helping me find out where these fevers are coming from?? \n\nI honestly feel so fed up, no one actually believes me. It’s making me want to give up. I actually don’t know what to do? ",

    "selftext": "The state of mental health services in the UK is devastating. As someone who has personally relied on these services, I’ve experienced firsthand the cracks in the system. Long waiting lists, inaccessible face-to-face care, ineffective referrals, and overburdened crisis lines have left countless people without the support they desperately need.\n\nIn my region, Derbyshire, services have been slashed. Contracts between providers are changing, leaving patients stranded in limbo or without options. For example, the NHS’s 24-hour helpline, once a lifeline, now operates as a triage service—but call-back promises often go unfulfilled. Attempts to access charities and peer support groups have been met with the same heartbreaking answer: oversubscription. This is not just a Derbyshire problem; it’s a national crisis.\n\nI’ve reached out to local MPs, Healthwatch Derbyshire, the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman, and major media outlets like the BBC, Channel 4, and national newspapers. Yet, awareness alone isn’t enough. We need a united voice to push for real action—adequate funding, access to diverse care options, and an end to bureaucratic barriers that prevent people from getting help.\n\nOur voices matter. Share your stories, your frustrations, and your ideas. Together, we can spotlight this issue and demand change. Let’s not allow anyone to be left behind in this broken system. If you've had similar experiences, please speak out. Change is possible, but only if we stand together.",

Regardless I put trust into the Samaritans because I needed to talk to someone as I felt incredibly low.\n\nOur conversation was flowing pretty well as I explained how I live and how bad my life had become. Eventually he asked me about my trauma and what happened. It was a really tough thing to do, but I talked about it with him. I was freezing at parts because I had never told another soul about what happened. It was painful to talk about, but I trusted him enough to share that with him. Afterwards I couldn't stop crying, but I thought he'd understood.\n\nEventually he said \"Can I ask you a personal question?\", which shocked me. I was unsure, but said yes. He then asked me if I was gay. This immediately made me think he might have thought I was gay because I was a man who got sexually assaulted by a man. I began to worry that I had been judged.\n\nThen following up he said \"Do you think you froze during the sexual assault because you were fascinated by what he was doing?\" At this point I realized what was going on. He hadn't just accused me of being gay, but he'd also implied I was \"fascinated\" by my traumatic sexual assault.\n\nI was in shock, experiencing a mixture of upset and anger. I shouted no down the phone, then hung up crying.

I noticed it at the time and thought it was weird, but things didn't click until the call was over.\n\nI feel so hurt by this call. I talked about something so difficult and traumatic and the Samaritan made out like I'd enjoyed my assault. It makes me worry about ever telling another person again because they might not understand. I've always felt so much shame about my assault, I was terrified that if I told someone they'd think I was gay because when I got assaulted I froze in fear and let him do as he wanted.

    "title": "Feel like I need to give up my life to care for mom’s mental health (27m) ",
    "selftext": "Hi all, \n\nLong and winding rant ahead but I need to get this off my chest. TL;DR below. \n\nI (27m) increasingly feel obligated to move back home and sacrifice my life opportunities to care for my mom’s mental health. \n\nFor context, we lost my dad, my eldest brother and both maternal grandparents in the last few years. Needless to say, this has been devastating and has turned both of our lives upside down. \n\nI have done my best to cope with this. In recent years, I have managed to graduate and move away to pursue a career. Work is extremely fast-paced and stressful, but at least I have friends and community there. I go for long walks in the green spaces, attend therapy regularly and I feel like building a life is actually possible. \n\nBack at home, my mom has also tried in her own way to rebuild her life. But she is very obviously clinically depressed and I suspect suicidal on and off. She says I am the most important thing in her life and that she doesn’t have anyone that cares about her other than me. I don’t think this is true - she has lots of friends, a bunch of hobbies a busy social life, but we just don’t have a family in the way other people do. This is compounded by the fact that - thankfully - very few of her friends have suffered to the extent we have. Many of them are retiring, becoming grandparents and enjoying the tail-end of overall very nice, comfortable lives. \n\nI am not expecting my mom to pretend nothing has happened or to be a ray of sunshine at all times, but her poor mental health impacts my life dramatically. She is only happy when I’m back home, which means taking time off or away from work specifically for that purpose, which annoys my colleagues to no end and takes a huge chunk of my annual leave which I could’ve spent relaxing or pursuing my own interests. Moreover, I feel like our relationship is inverted - I’m meant to look to her for stability, not the other way around. \n\nIf I don’t text or call for a few days (due to my very stressful job), she will become very upset with me. Even if I do call, the conversation will ultimately circle back to how lonely she is, how she has nobody and how lucky I am that I’m young enough to build a new life. Needless to say, this evokes an enormous amount of guilt whenever I do manage to enjoy myself. \n\nI have begged her to seek help but she doesn’t listen. She is finally going to therapy after I sat her down and made her pick one, but I think she expects them to just hand her a roadmap of how to fix her life and says it’s useless when they don’t. She also refuses to try medication, which I find frustrating as it has helped me enormously. \n\nAll of this to say - I feel enormously guilty for living my life and that I may eventually lose my mom to suicide if I don’t go back home. I love my mom, but home has absolutely no opportunities and I know for a fact I will stagnate. I am stressed, depressed and feel like I have had to deal with way too much, way too early in life. I don’t know how to solve this beyond accepting that I need to move back home and give up on the life I might’ve had. \n\nTL;DR - my mom and I lost most of our family. She is extremely depressed, possibly suicidal, won’t seek help and is only happy when I’m back living at home with her. I feel guilty for moving away and building a life I enjoy and I don’t know how to resolve without giving that up and moving back.",

This in itself has been difficult because I have not found CBT to be effective and my situation is too bad for the \"wellness groups\" that I keep being offered. But on the other hand, I'm neither suicidal nor in danger of hurting people, so I've been stuck in limbo trying to find out if there are any other options.\n\nI finally made some minor progress getting to see a counselor in person. Not a therapist as such, but she can refer me to other services, I believe.\n\nBut I am really struggling to talk about my problems honestly and clearly.\n\nThe problem is that I think I have issues that are blatantly unfixable. I am extremely unhappy with my physical body, appearance, gender, and just about everything. This has no \"cause\" (such as a traumatic event) and I have felt that way for as long as I can remember. I cannot say this out loud. Not only do I get far too emotional beyond my control, and thus it's PHYSICALLY hard to talk, I also fear being either deemed too crazy/unstable, having some undesirable misdiagnosis slapped on my record (I've seen too many stories on this subreddit about women being quickly misdiagnosed with EUPD/BPD) or dropped entirely because my case is too complex (which has happened before with the therapy services)\n\nI know how I feel is \"illogical\" and doesn't make sense, but I can't change that. I have tried, for years, to \"just accept it\", or cope, or wait it out to see if I \"grow out of it\" - I didn't.

On multiple occasions staff members have been manipulative towards me and have refused to listen to me about anything. I am wondering if this is another tactic they are using to make me feel anxious? \n\nIn all honesty, it feels like CMHT want me to be unwell and want to keep me unwell. The time when I had the least contact with them is when I made the most progress in recovery. I want to discharge myself from their care but with this review thing I don’t know what could happen, I don’t know if they could force me into hospital for refusing to engage with them. ",

    "selftext": "This one is not too bad because it focuses more on care than the intricacies of the conditions themselves, but I find myself getting agitated when accessing other communities. \n\nI always seem to be in the minority group with symptoms that are rare or not well understood or part of the group that has symptoms that are heavily stigmatised, and it makes me feel like I'm drowning even more. \n\nObviously everyone is entitled to speak about their experience, but these spaces often create hierarchies, where certain symptoms or experiences are \"true\" and others are \"false\".\n\nIt’s also frustrating to see personal experiences conflated with diagnostic criteria, creating misconceptions that can lead to harm. This becomes even more difficult when some individuals assume they’re experts on a condition simply because they live with it, feeling entitled to decide who does or doesn’t “belong”—especially when it comes to those without formal diagnoses.\n\n(And I say this as someone formally diagnosed who got accused of not having the condition due to my symptoms not fitting the stereotypical view). \n\nYou're an expert of how that condition affects *you* and nothing else. \n\nWhile advocacy is a major part of mental health discourse, I question whether it’s true advocacy when it only uplifts certain narratives, or spreads perspectives that exclude others. \n\nI've never been a fan, but I'm really beginning to resent being mentally ill because of the situations it puts me in and the people it places me around. And I'm not talking about mentally ill people as a whole, in fact, I've had quite pleasant experiences with those going through a really difficult time. \n\nI'm talking about the quite frankly, nasty individuals, who are such due to their nature, and whilst they want exceptions to be made for them and their difficulties, they look their nose down at their more unwell counterparts because their presentation is different to theirs. \n\nMy resentment stems from how my mental health isolates me and prevents me from being able to form fulfilling relationships that would make me less dependent on these communities, which have often caused more harm than good.\n\nIt’s incredibly painful to live a life where you’ve been shunned and abused by others, only to develop conditions as a result—conditions that not only lessen your quality of life but add further environments that replicate this trauma. In these spaces, you continue to struggle to connect and feel seen, especially because your experience doesn’t align with the “average” one.\n\nOn top of that, there’s the frustration that professionals often treat participation in these spaces as proof of engagement or willingness to seek support, even when these communities don’t feel safe or helpful.\n\nI recognize that I contribute to my own suffering by seeking out these spaces, but I only do so out of sheer desperation in my darkest moments because I have no other avenues for connection or socialization.\n\nI'm in no position to seek out deep relationships hence the reliance on online spaces. I'm mostly mourning the reality that at my age it's difficult to form friendships in general without a life of isolation and the difficulties of mental health following in suit. \n\nI'm kind of just despairing right now.

    "selftext": "Last week I lodged a complaint and now I'm wondering whether or not I should have, could I get some outside input?\n I've been trying to remind myself that the NHS is struggling and that sometimes things happen in ways we don't want them to and I've both beaten myself up and talked myself into a spiralling hole at this point. Should I have? Did I overreact? Am I justified? Will they know it's me? Will it affect my care? Aaaaaaa\n\nI have no idea how to lay out a decent format for this huge mess of a post, so I'll try and clear it up as I go 😅\n\n\nBit of personal background: I have poor experience with mental health services my entire life. My mum pushed for years trying to get somebody to listen to her about me and we've never gotten anywhere past \"here's a diagnosis, good luck\" and sometimes medicating. I have a GP appointment in December but I'm basically a variety box of diagnosises; BPD, ADHD, anxiety, depression, I'm also on a waiting list for an autism assessment. Honestly at this point I have absolutely no idea what's actually wrong with me, I'm consistently unable to ask for help and this is the only long term thing I've ever managed.\n\nBackground relevant to the complaint but not part of it: I was referred to a consultant last year for my ADHD. The first appointment, she was 20 minutes late but hey, it happens! The first thing she says when she sees me pacing a circle in the waiting room floor, is \"I don't even need to ask, I'm already confident you're ADHD\" (well, yeah, I'm diagnosed, I'm here to ask about medication lol)\nShe saw me for ten minutes, asked me why I hadn't sought help earlier? I had, in 2020, where I was seen by a psych twice for maybe an hour total, put on a whopping dose of quietiapine, and discharged (another disappointment but I was a lot less determined 4 years ago). But somehow there was no information about these last dealings with the mental health unit; my BPD diagnosis, my prescribed medication, anything like that. The address down for me was 8 years and 2 addresses old. Weird but again, not necessarily too much of a worry, except that a lot of ADHD medication comes with \"not recommended for those with BPD\", lol. \n\nI've requested shared care with my GP, as there's a pharmacist in the GP, but I have no idea what's going on with that and I'm too much of an anxious mess what with all the other issues to even ask at this point.\n\n\nMost recent issue and the interaction that spurred the complaint:\nI emailed for a repeat prescription on the 24th October. After 7 working days, I still hadn't had a call and had ran out at this point (poor management on my own part, I know) so I went in to ask. Prescription wasn't ready, but would be later that day. Cool! My mum dropped by there to ask them, partially because I was already feeling incredibly embarrassed and that I'd been too quick to react, and she works nearby and has better luck getting my meds in pharmacies near her. They told her no, it wasn't ready, and wouldn't be until at least the next day as nobody who could issue it was in. So she called me to confirm what I'd said, and then called them back.\nThankfully they called me the next day to say it was ready and on the way, I used every ounce of courage I could muster and called *seven* different pharmacies, because I was worried that I'd go in and then not get my medication in the dosage written on it. They all said no, so between that and feeling like an idiot after now 4 interactions with this place for the same prescription, I was a sobbing mess by the time I got in there. They've issued me another 6 month hospital script, and this time the hospital pharmacy have told me that if they don't have specific dosage amounts, they can make it work if they have other doses in stock instead, which I'd never been made aware of before now. All that for a prescription I'm not even sure is working 😭😭\n\n\nThe rest of the reasons:\n\n- I have had continuous struggle accessing my repeat prescriptions from them. At one point, I was given one for the hospital pharmacy, to last 6 months... Except often the hospital pharmacy didn't have what was needed, coupled with me so I was having to email for community ones based on what local pharmacists had in stock. In June, my prescription wasn't ready 20 days after request, iirc because the consultant hadn't been there to issue it.\nIn July, I picked up my \"ready\" prescription, took it to the pharmacy and they couldn't give me my meds and the consultant's student hadn't put the right information on it, and had left the building and wouldn't be able to fix it until the following Monday. So when it was ready the second time, my mum went to collect it, took it to a pharmacy and they couldn't give her my medication because it didn't have a dosage amount written on it... She drove back there, somebody not my usual consultant wrote her a new one, she went back and then they still couldn't issue it because it hadn't been signed.\n\n- my follow up appointment for my medication was cancelled. And then the replacement appointment was cancelled. And then finally I was reviewed in April and had medication changed. Reviewed and changed again in June, with my next appointment in December coming. I'm currently on the highest possible dose of Concerta, which isn't working, but I really don't want to risk coming off of without discussion.\n\n- The consultant is regularly late to the appointments that aren't cancelled/rearrange d, which yeah, things do happen, but this means my appointments are never longer than \"here's a prescription for the next one we're gonna try\" and I hardly have time to ask questions or raise issues before I'm hustled out of the door again. I understand they're going to be incredibly busy, and that ADHD is not necessarily the most dire thing to be seeing someone for on any given day, but I hardly feel like I have any input on my own care and I'm too nervous of a person to be able to open my mouth at the time of anything happening.",

    "selftext": "I spoke to an IAPT counsellor twice and their supervisor said I now have to choose something specific to work on for the next 4 sessions, then wait 3 months and re-refer.\n\nThe two sessions I had I just went through the depression/anxiety questionnaire for most of the first session (btw there's definitely a difference in how I answer the questions verbally vs when just clicking answers on the digital questionnaire) and across both sessions talked a tiny bit about what I wanted from therapy, that I had worse problems before but already fixed them myself with a mix of concerted effort and luck (like physical social anxiety attacks, depersonalisation/derealisation, hypervigilance, ocd, body dysmorphia, others that don't fit a clinical label), that my parents fought a lot and I didn't know that was abnormal until into my 20s and discussed that my parents were dishonest and incredulous like I'm crazy when I spoke to them and how exhausting it is to have to argue for hours with two people at the same time, basically gaslighting me into thinking I'm the problem (I didn't use words like gaslighting or narcissism) and we talked about dissociation and cultural stuff (I'm a 2nd/3rd gen). I also mentioned I was \"abused\" and bullied, but didn't discuss the nature of this due to time constraints.\n\nI have to decide if I want to try therapy where it's focused on solutions to current difficulties (get referred to cbt) or therapy that involves talking about their experiences. Which seems an inappropriate dichotomy, seeing as talking about the past makes it easier to identify or remember current difficulties and it's hard to explain my difficulties to a therapist or other person without explaining where they came from, as otherwise they're literally unlikely to understand what I'm experiencing (hell, look at all the reddit threads where people make false assumptions about people's thoughts and motivations when they share a problem). I also have to choose one thing without outside perspective on what it might make the most sense to focus on and to identify everything for myself, whereas an outside perspective was part of the whole point of referring to therapy (as opposed to just reading self-help or therapy resources myself, like I already have).\n\nTherapy seems pointless if it's still just me having to identify everything myself - I'm not sure why people even recommend therapy to anyone, since it doesn't actually reduce the amount of work you have to do. I've already mentioned things that cause me problems, but I have to choose one thing, even though some are linked to each other, so addressing one thing requires not ignoring the others (eg phone avoidance is linked to difficulty self-advocating, difficulty with uncertainty or thinking people will react harshly or abandon you if you conflict with them at all). I've already said things that cause me problems in life are phone avoidance, that I don't self-advocate unless I'm angry, shutting down under uncertainty, spending a few to several hours a day talking to myself and/or ruminating and they know I'm not close with any family, have one friend who I see a few times a year, have had employment and housing difficulties (they did refer me to the employment team, good). When she asked what I want I said to live a normal life, understandably that's too vague lol.\n\nHow do you choose something to work on? It's also possible the thing I most need to work on to improve my life functioning is something I haven't identified yet, but therapy can't help me identify it, so it's no different to just doing it alone.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone, I'm 31M and going to try to cut a long story short the best I can, and would like to know if anyone else suffers with similar issues whether feeling invalidated in themselves, by others and by just not getting any sort of diagnosis for long term mental health problems. \n\nBasically I've suffered with mental health issues for over 10 years now, been on over 6 anti depressants and been resistant too them all and can't take beta blockers due to asthma. Over time I've gotten worse mental and physically and numerous things have contributed, last year being I had gastroenteritis and ever since had extreme fatigue to the point that I walk my dog and come walk and I'm ready to go back to bed. I'm to believe it's post infection or the GP's like to keep blaming my anxiety as I've also since suffered with stomach issues and been given the label of IBS after numerous tests (bloods, endoscopy, CT scan) and losing 3 stone in weight.\nAlways suffered with pain, the usual chest pain as well as paresthetica in my right leg and random pins and needles in my hands and feet. Also suffered with migraines/chronic headaches for years, bruxism and my teeth are knackered already and have to wear a gum guard at night.\n\nOn top of this I'm ill most days, there's not many days that my allergies don't flair up or I've got a cold which I'm aware at this point stress does a number on your immune system and honestly I can't calm it down. I've been through CBT 4 times and find it worthless to be honest.\n\nThe only light I've had out of this year is that I had a diagnosis of ADHD which could sum up certain aspects of my life and why I've struggled to this point as well as been put on titration waiting list. \n\nEverytime I've gone to a GP this year it's like I'm a liar, as though every pain and this extreme fatigue is just always anxiety and that's it right me off, granted I do suffered with general anxiety disorder and have done for years, unfortunately it runs in my dad's side of my family, but before I could kind of overcome it and was working and functioning.\n\nGranted around 5 years ago I had to leave work to help my now wife with her epilepsy and my son who is now 5 years old who has been diagnosed with autism which has led me down the path to an autism assessment but all of this has been done by me, the first ADHD referral was refused by the NHS and went RTC and have been diagnosed combined type. \n\nTrust me, I'm not looking for a label, I'm just looking for answers and help and it's taken till this year to just even get the ADHD diagnosis, and be told I've got IBS, and even now they still won't do anything for me. I finished CBT recently with the option to see if they could refer me to the mental health hub and several weeks later no answer. Saw a dietician who was supposed to just simply send me some information out and nothing. \nI'm constantly struggling and I can't get past a GP and CBT after 10 years because apparently om never sever enough or it's like when I describe my symptoms I'm speaking out of my backside each time and it's too easy to keep blaming anxiety. \n\nI read about chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, hyperthyroidism and some fit what's happening and tell them and they just don't seem to think it's happening to me, as though I'm too young for it to be happening or something.\nI struggle to get out of bed at this stage. If I didn't have a wife and son to get up for everyday I probably wouldn't get up, not because I'm lazy but because im exhausted, in pain and half the time a get up from laying down or even sitting I go dizzy.\n\nI know some of this may come across as health anxiety and maybe it is, at this point I'm losing any chance of a diagnosis that is going to help me in life, I'm crossing my fingers the ADHD medication may help.\nI'm supposed to be the carer for my wife and son but my wife cares for me more at this point, and all I do is beat myself up for not being normal and working which just adds to the feeling of guilt and judgement of myself and others may see me as, but to be honest I can't see in the foreseeable future when I ever could go back to work, even without my caring responsibilities, I'm just too burnout.\n\nApologies for the longevity of this post, I'm just tired of being tired, not getting any validation after so many years and because of it still feeling like a fraud to what's such as silent illness. \n\nCan somebody please relate to this so I know I'm not just losing my marbles at this stage in my life. I'm not asking for a diagnosis with anything ive listed, just relatable stories to your mental health journey.\n\nThank you for reading. ",

    "selftext": "So in the time I've been trying to get seen by someone a major depressive episode has both started and finished (it was shorter than normal, it was really bad for only about 5 weeks). I eventually saw a GP afterwards and she said she was furious with the psychiatrist for having rejected my referral as she suspects I have bipolar disorder. Which tracks with what I have been told by psychiatrists abroad as well as history of psychosis and very poor response to antidepressants \n \nThing is 9 years ago I was under cmht (in a different area) and I did DBT. They said I didn't actually have BPD though (although I was the only person in the DBT group that supposedly didn't have a personality disorder) but they refused to say what my actual diagnosis was. Then when I moved to Spain they were like err you blatantly do have BPD and quite a severe case at that. \n \nBut now cmht (different area) want nothing to do with me. It is frustrating because I do a lot of recovery groups and people say how they've been diagnosed with X Y and Z and they are on certain medications and sometimes even have access to therapy. And it's like they have a complete explanation for what is wrong with them and they get help for it. I am left high and dry \n \nFormally in this country I am diagnosed with just GAD and stimulant use disorder. It's worth mentioning I have only even been attempting to access mental health services when I already have a few months of clean time because I know they don't bother helping people who are using. But I'm not anymore, and these two diagnoses between them do not explain much of my problems at all. \n \nI'm on the waiting list for an ADHD assessment, but even if you include that, there are still mood episodes that are not explained or treated, as well as social anxiety (that has a massive impact on my life) and i really really struggle with managing relationships generally. I constantly worry that people secretly hate me and are going to disappear from my life and this makes me lose the plot. I haven't even attempted to date anyone for years because not only am I terrified of being rejected (which is frankly inevitable) but if somehow I do persuade them to like me for a bit then I will not be able to deal with them leaving me. Thats how I ended up on drugs in the first place it was either that or suicide. \n \nBut secondary care cba to help me yet they help loads of people that I know some of which are frankly no more severe than I am. I think the psychiatrist that I saw hated me and iirc he is in charge of all the referrals for the initial response service in my area.

He's been feeling down and depressed the entire time I've known him. Parts of this are really affecting our relationship to the point where I don't think I can continue to be in it. He agreed to get on antidepressants about two years ago assuming those would magically fix his issues, but obviously nothing has really changed. He's on Mirtazapine (which I've been told by several people with personal experience or medical degrees is not much better than just an old-person sleeping pill), which I believe he was put on to 'not affect his sex life'. I never had sex with him prior to his ADs, but I'm pretty sure they're affecting it anyway. I've tried to be patient, empathetic, kind, allow for home days as well as make plans for dates etc. I've tried to be more pushy and tried to get him to come to the gym with me for those endorphins, but he's only come twice - after a fight. He only agreed and has now stuck to a weekly jog when I said I'd charge him for it if he didn't. I've suggested getting him to change his ADs, but he won't book an appointment. I got him a little self-reflection book to fill a page every day, but he only does this as damage control after fights.. well allegedly, I have never asked to see the book.\n\n  \nHe has now FINALLY agreed to try therapy, but I'm worried it will be entirely pointless. He isn't self aware at all and won't go in knowing what he's expecting to gain from it. He realises that he needs help, but I know that really the only reason he's going is to make me stay. Based on the issues that we are having, there's clearly something in his past that needs unpacking (not necessarily anything textbook traumatic) and I feel like what he needs is that american TV type of therapy where someone asks the right questions to make the light bulb go off, but my experience with NHS was that they were just reading a script and assigning one-size-fits-all homework. Is that still how it is? Is there anything I can do or help him with to make this any more worthwhile? Annoyingly, he has access to private healthcare through work, which I feel could be more beneficial, but he has only agreed if NHS doesn't work and I just don't have it in me anymore to wait for him to be able to meet my needs for another many months or years. \n\n  \nAlso just to say, relationship or not, we were friends years before that, so I want his life quality to improve regardless and I don't think he can get there on his own and I also don't think there's anyone else in his life to push him to do anything about it either.

I’ve worked with this company for around 3 months and have called in sick twice due to this issue. Will I get in trouble? Or am I being too paranoid?

I get this strong urge to punch something or scream, and it makes me really anxious, almost like I can’t escape this feeling.\n\nI’ve tried everything I can think of to manage this anger. I’ve done things like deep breathing, journaling, and even exercising. I’ve had some small successes, but nothing seems to work long-term. The anger comes back, especially when I see my friend getting upset or feeling hopeless. i'd rather have no friends then a mentally ill crying and complaining one. i've been \"there for him\" and he says hes grateful but that means i have to deal with him\n\ni can't escape from this guy until hes somewhat better as i see him in many classes and he'll always find the oppurtunity. i'm gonna recommend him to see a GP to get meds as thats his last hope because he's too moanining and complaining to get confidence the hard way and didnt wanna do EMDR therapy because he said \"why do i have to remember when my life was shit\" even though his ptsd was from bullying and a can of £5 pepper spray can be easily used against a bully\n\nHas anyone else dealt with something similar?

I'm extremely empathetic but so far I have managed to keep work and volunteering separate from my personal life. \n\nExcept I do have this friend, a close friend, who is very reliant on me. He's got complex special needs and this causes him to act erratic, sometimes on top of the world with all these ideas about who he's going to be but then he crashes, and becomes very depressive very easily. Both when he's 'manic' and when he's depressed, it drains my energy. I know that sounds awful, and I don't mean it to. Friendships are for better or for worse, but I've found lately, with one crisis after another at work, then with all the other things I do, that I'm so exhausted and can't provide the emotional support to my friends and family that I once could. \n\nI don't think I am doing to badly, balancing my life, but I don't think it'll last long if I have to go from 50+ hours a week being involved in mental health conversations, crises, research, reports etc to then spending more time trying to uplift others in my personal life. It's not sustainable. \n\nFor now, I will have to make do. But if this is the case, I need some tips. What do you guys do to protect your mental health?

I resisted this, as I was in my 30s and had no difficulties living a normal life, I was just suffering a lot and struggling to cope as would any human being in the situation I was in.\n\nEventually, I caved, and called my GP. They prescribed me 15mg mirtazapine in a 3-minute phonecall with 0 safety warnings, instructing me to take it in the evening before bed.\n\nUpon taking the first pill, I slept for 14h (double what was normal), had extremely vivid nightmares and woke up extremely groggy and barely able to move any of my limbs. I also had zero morning wood, which turned out to be total ED in the coming days.\n\nWhen this continued, I spoke to my GP who simply stated \"it was probably my unhealthy lifestyle\". I was so in shape that strangers approached me at the gym for advice. I ended up needing two weeks off of work before I could physically drag myself out of bed and get myself there.\n\nAfter 2 months, I was tired of feeling emotionally numb, ED, constant fatigue etc. and attempted to come off the drug. When I did, I experienced total breakdown, pure panic and ended up off work again. Bear in mind, pre-drug, I was working full time, exercising, living normally, just having a hard time.\n\nThe GP put me on 30mg, stating that it would \"help even more with my underlying illness\" and that it wasn't as fatiguing. I stabilised enough to return to work, and the fatigue was marginally better but I still needed 12h+ of sleep, and the higher dose gave me adrenaline rushes, heart palpitations and the nightmares turned suicidal.\n\nAfter having EMDR therapy, which actually helped with my issues, I decided that I wanted off of the drugs due to the side effects making life very difficult. After just 4 months of use, I tapered off for a month.\n\nWhile tapering, my fatigue reduced, my sleep went to a nice, normal 7-8h, my ED went away, the adrenaline rushes and heart palpitations reduced etc.\n\n8 days after stopping, I began to feel very fatigued and my cognition was so poor I couldn't write an email at work. I told my boss I might be coming down with something and said I'd work from home until I felt better. That night, I barely slept, and began to twitch. I continued to deteriorate and experienced new symptoms arising every day- severe nausea, vertigo, cognitive issues, severe fatigue, twitches, brain zaps, skin reactions, stinging eyes, bruxism, almost total insomnia and extreme nightmares when I did sleep. I lost 10kg of muscle wastage in 3 weeks. The heart palpitations returned way worse.\n\nA couple of weeks in, and I had to stop working from home as I could barely stand, and barely string a sentence together. I also developed genital numbness, with the return of total ED, and couldn't feel urination.\n\nI have had a massive array of tests. Every specialist I have seen has stated \"I've seen numerous people who have had issues from mirtazapine/antidepressants\". My thyroid was disrupted for 8-9 months, in a way an endocrinologist stated \"shouldn't be possible\". I had constantly high cortisol on morning blood tests and over 24h periods measured via urine collection for 7 months. I have unusual results on MRI scans- neurology have seen multiple patients with neurological issues following antidepressant use, some of which took years to partially recover.\n\nI went on to develop total anhedonia, total lack of anxiety, zero fear, no response to \"jumpscare\" stimuli like loud noises etc. I struggled cognitively to watch TV, music became extremely irritating noise etc. I have also regularly struggled with movement and speech, ontop of the severe fatigue which obviously limits these things as well. The mental symptoms, such as anhedonia, or experiencing akathisia while having severe fatigue are totally inhumane.\n\nI am now more than 18 months off of mirtazapine. I still do not work, I am incapable of caring for myself. Until recently, I often struggled to do anything process-based like make a sandwich, so I couldn't feed myself. This was in addition to often being bed or chair bound due to fatigue.\n\nA number of symptoms have improved. I no longer have heart palpitations. I sleep every night but often wake up at 4am, or 5am and often have very poor sleep quality with nightmares. The nightmares took more than a year to stop being suicidal. The majority of days I am no longer bedridden due to fatigue, but still feel exhausted and rough constantly. Regularly light headed, regular headaches etc.\n\nI still have bad sexual dysfunction, but no numbness. I have issues going to the bathroom both in terms of struggling to go when I want to, and having accidents.\n\nI am severely depressed, constantly. I would love to exercise, work, have relationships but I simply can't. I'm too physically ill and pretty much everything is significantly harder than it should be. I do my best to go for a walk most days now, but it is difficult.\n\nPre-drug I was very successful in my career, had a team of people reporting to me, went to the gym 4-6 times a week, went for a run before work intermittently, or on lunchbreaks if I worked from home, loved to hike and be outdoors, and had many friends and hobbies etc. \n\nThe RCPsych has this to say about withdrawal symptoms:\n\n\"Other people can have more severe symptoms which last much longer (sometimes months or more than a year).\n\nAt the moment we cannot predict who will get the more serious withdrawal symptoms.\"\n\nThere is no treatment for this. No warnings are given to patients. I am in touch with others in the UK who had similar reactions to mirtazapine. I may suffer for many more months or years, or even indefinitely. I may have lost the ability to have a partner, children etc. My career is destroyed. I have lost the overwhelming majority of my friends. The financial impact is obviously horrendous.\n\nMy doctors simply state that it is rare and I'm unlucky and ask \"what do you want us to do?\".\n\nI was a normal person before taking these drugs, I was just going through things that would have anyone struggling. They have taken things from me that I didn't realise a human being could lose and have totally altered my personality along with making me extremely ill.\n\nI hope that I recover in time. Many people on support groups seem to improve eventually, but not everyone.\n\n",

We have a romantic getaway coming up and it's giving me something to look forward to while everything else in my life feels like a hopeless mess. Again, she's been nothing but supportive, but this is a concern I have about starting the medication\n\nSome of my friends who've experienced depression and anxiety also think that I'm being put onto medication too soon. My doctor sent me 2 multiple choice surveys, we exchanged a couple of emails, and she recommended the medication. I haven't had any in-person consultations with anyone to discuss the nuances of how I've been feeling, so I'm concerned that this might be premature. I have no issues taking medication, but I'm wondering if I should speak to a counsellor or therapist first. My doc sent me links for a couple of community support groups, and there are specialists in my local area with affordable rates.\n\nI know individual experiences are different, but I'd appreciate any feedback from people who've tried sertraline.

    "selftext": "Today I had a truly baffling situation with my local health clinic. I called to renew my asthma meds and also asked for GP appointment since I would like to try some new meds for my intense fear of flying. I explained that I had diazepam prescription from another country, but they weren't helping me much, just making me sleepy when I took them during flights. I tried going without anything for a while, but that didn't work - the last two flights I had to get drunk to not constantly cry and rock back and forth with my heart jumping through my mouth. The person on the phone said GP cannot prescribe anything. Then they suggested talkworks and OTC stuff. I said I have tried talkworks and I don't think they can talk me out of being scared that I will die in an airplane crash. I also don't want any herbal medicine (I didn't explain why, I was just annoyed that they suggested OTC, because I know they don't sell real meds OTC unless its a decongestant). I then asked if I could instead get a referral to see a psychiatrist. I was told they don't refer to psychiatrists and I should try to get an appointment myself. Of course, now I googled it and I can see - they definitively do referrals. They just think I am a drug addict or smth. Great. \n\nHot the fck do people get meds for their phobias in UK without wiping out their savings? I've lived in three different European countries - none had such nonsense. In Finland they even prescribed me a giant pack of Diazepam for the future use when I have to fly, because I said I was going to UK. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa. Checked the private psychiatrist prices - >400 pounds per visit. In my motherland Latvia it costs 40 pounds and last I checked salaries in UK weren't 10 times bigger than in Latvia. I want to scream.

    "selftext": "A bit of a rant but also seeking some advice\n\nAll my life I've (20M) been struggling with my mental health and it only seems to be getting worse for me. I feel more miserable by the year, and it's got to the point where for the past 2 years I have felt no emotions at all besides this vague and numbing feeling of sadness and an intense anger at everything and everyone (I've even started to hate concepts and ideas because I've ran out of actual physical things to hate). \n\nI've tried to get help so many times before, but it seems as though every single mental health service in this country is utter dogshit, to put it politely. As a kid I used to go to CAMHS, and all they ever did was make me and my parents go to family counselling where a psychologist would just get me to draw how I was feeling and then blame my parents. I didn't even receive a diagnosis until I tried to commit suicide when I was 16, and even then it was only for OCD (which really does feel like a huge misdiagnosis the more I think about it), and all they did after they was put me on a series of zombifying drugs which never did anything apart from give me horrible side effects. As soon as I turned 18 they essentially kicked me out of the mental health system without even telling me, so I was completely on my own for a year, until I tried to commit suicide again when I was 19 and got sent to A&E, and I was signed up to the adult mental health services. After my attempt I was genuinely hopeful that they'd take me semi-seriously and something would happen, but they have not helped me one bit. Every session I went to was with a new trainee therapist, and so each session I was constantly having to explain my situation again to a new person who had never met me before and would never meet me again, so nothing ever got anywhere. It felt like I was being taken for a joke and I just stopped going (and it doesn't even seem like they've realised - I've not been contacted by them at all since May this year). The hotlines I've been given by A&E are useless too - they take hours to respond, which is useless in a crisis, and when they do pick up they are literally the epitome of the 'just pour yourself a cup of tea and have a bath' cliche we all know too well. I really want to try private therapies and treatments, but I simply can't afford them so it's a nonstarter really. It's like the UK is and always will be completely incapable of helping people struggling with mental illness. There is something fundamentally wrong with the way the whole UK medical establishment understands and treats it.\n\nBut I need help so badly. I desperately need to know what is actually wrong with me (I definitely do not just have OCD, if I even have it in the first place), and I desperately need some kind of therapy that will actually improve my life and not just be a box ticking exercise to hopefully get the suicide statistics down and make the UK look better in global statistics. But the problem is I feel as if I've exhausted all the options available to me. There is no one to go to anymore. What do I do? Where do you go to get help? I literally have no idea what to do anymore I am on the verge of snapping.",

    "selftext": "Hi all\n\nI’ve been in psychodynamic psychotherapy for a few years now. Unfortunately, my insurance in the UK only covered a limited number of sessions, and since then, I’ve been paying out of pocket. At £110 per session, this has taken a significant toll on my finances, especially since the NHS hasn’t been able to provide the support I need. My therapist will be raising their fee to £140 per session soon. While I’m grateful for the progress I’ve made, I’m feeling the pressure of this increased cost, especially since we both agree that one session a week is the bare minimum for my needs.\n\nI’m at a crossroads and would love to hear your thoughts on my situation. Here are the options I’m considering:\n\n1. Continue with my current therapist at the new rate and stick to one session per week.This feels like it might not be enough, but it’s the least expensive option.\n   \n2. Pay the increased rate for two sessions per week (which would be £280 weekly). This is quite expensive and would further strain my finances.\n\n3. Look for different therapists who charge less (around £70 per session) and potentially do 2-3 sessions per week.While this option is appealing financially, I’m hesitant to leave my current therapist after building a strong therapeutic relationship and having them know my case so well.\n\nI also can’t help but feel that my therapist, being on the younger side and still building their practice, may have different financial pressures compared to someone with decades of experience. Part of me feels it might be noble to step aside and let them find clients who can afford their new rates.\n\nI’d love to hear your experiences or advice on navigating these kinds of decisions. May be I've missed something completely? Have any of you faced similar challenges? What factors did you consider when deciding whether to stay with a therapist or seek someone new? ",

I cant risk being sectioned, because that will blacklist ever being allowed important surgery, and that would cause so much harm that i might as well have not tried to ever get better.

How to cure depression (everyone bar this psychiatrist says im severely depressed and functioning only due to anxiety) without access to try more medications, and no diagnosis?

I still massively struggle with my mood and have what I consider ‘short’ episodes of like… not even psychosis but semi-psychosis? thats what I’m going to call it. Basically I’m susceptible to stress and when I get too stressed out I have a breakdown for an evening to a couple of days where I have psychotic symptoms, but I take PRN and I calm down. And keep in mind the PRN I now only take is a couple of promethazine, so nothing strong, and it settles me (ish). \n\nI’m looking for advice or to hear stories of people struggling with mood and psychosis about their experience with DVLA examinations; if I say too much are they likely to take my license?

I saw a lot of posts of people struggling with side effects of sertraline, and I was really scared to start any SSRI. Every SSRI doesn’t work for everyone, but if you’re in the same boat as I was 6 months ago hearing some positive experience might help. \n\nI should’ve done this years ago. Sertraline has given me my life and career back.\n\nI’ve always been an incredibly anxious person, I just thought that was how my brain was. I hit rock bottom in March, there was nothing specifically stressful happening in my life at the time, and I had a panic attack in a supermarket car park in the car with my partner and inconsolably cried that my brain was broken. I would cry at anything and feel overwhelmed, even if there was nothing making me upset. \n\nI went to see my GP, was formally diagnosed with anxiety, referred to NHS talking therapies and prescribed 50mg of sertraline and 10mg of propranolol to take when needed. The first week was ROUGH. I felt drained and on edge, wanted to do nothing but sleep, and could barely stomach to eat anything. I regretted even starting the medication, but called my GP who told me to try stick it out for 2 weeks and hope the side effects subside, which they did. \n\nIt wasn’t an overnight fix, but i distinctly remember waking up on day about 3 weeks after upping the dose to 100mg and feeling a sense of relief. I wasn’t waking up with dread, I hadn’t needed to take propranolol for over a week, I had more energy. I put more effort in when I was getting ready, I wasn’t having to force myself into the shower in a morning, or overthinking everything I needed to do that day. I was looking forward to seeing friends and going to university. I got my life back. Looking back I wholeheartedly think I was depressed, but didn’t acknowledge it because I didn’t have the textbook symptoms of suicidal ideation and assumed it was only anxiety.\n\nNHS talking therapies didn’t work for me, but Sertraline has changed my life. In the last 6 months I’m motivated to finish my degree again, I passed my driving test, started a new job teaching part time  which I adore. I wouldn’t have been able to do these things 6 months ago - that’s not an exaggeration either, I literally failed my driving test due to anxiety 5 times before being on the medication. I’m actually planning for the future now. \n\nIf you’re like me 6 months ago and nervous to contact the GP, take the leap. It’s not an over night fix, it takes some trial and error to get the dose or medication right, but as of right now I can confidently say I should have done this years ago.",

It started with muscle twitching and shaking and ended up with me having mild visual hallucinations, rigors-style convulsing and a total inability to sleep for two nights. This all happened in around five days.\n\nI finally made the connection and stopped the medication on Monday just gone, and I've had an excruciating few days as the symptoms have eased off. I've actually had to come down and stay with my Mum for the last few days (I'm 31...) because I didn't feel safe being alone.\n\nIn the five days since I stopped taking the medication I've had strange waves of deep mental anguish/agitation, depression, feeling disconnected and unreal, and some somatic OCD symptoms like being super aware of my breathing, blinking and swallowing. If a random sound happens (next door started drilling) I've been checking with my mum that she can hear it too. I know this is unhealthy but I don't trust my brain. I also know hypervigilance is the fuel for anxiety but I'm finding it incredibly difficult to snap out of that state given the wider context.\n\nI've got an appointment with a GP on Monday as I'd like them to do a blood test but otherwise I don't even know what to say or ask for. Likewise, I thought about booking in with a therapist but it's such an odd situation that I don't know what style of therapy could help. I'm also absolutely fucked work-wise with work for clients now overdue but my brain is really not all there and I feel I still need more time to gently recover and regain trust in my body. \n\nThe good news is that my physical and mental state seems to be slowly returning to baseline, but I just don't trust that I haven't damaged or traumatized myself permanently or that these unbearable symptoms won't return in some way. Any thoughts / ideas?\n\nEDIT: This is an update for anyone who finds this post while dealing with similar issues. TLDR: you will be okay.\n\nFor around a week after stopping the pills I still felt like I was white-knuckling life. The shaking and hallucinations stopped quickly, but I still felt very twitchy and 'wrong' in my body. I had some strange episodes of extremely low mood but each would pass within an hour or so.\n\nDuring the second week I was able to function almost normally, with a lingering sense of unreality, and the symptoms slowly faded away.

I managed to have a conversation with both the therapists in question after having to contact the out of hours support number cause they kept going to voicemail as it was nearing their closing tine (I got the call just after 4, was starting to walk home when i got the text, spent about 15 mins trying to contact before opting for OOH number who managed to get me in contact thankfull), and got to vent out how this switch made me feel after waiting and being told I'd be seeing specific person for specific reason, and about how my prior experience with Silvercloud has made me doubtful of CBT and eventually had a rescheduled call yesterday with the original therapist, but it wasnt a \"true\" TT call, just asking how I felt, if I wanted to continue and give it a chance because I was too worked up about the situation to really think clearly. In the end, we came to the conclusion it was best to drop it as I can't commit to weekly sessions due to current privacy concerns, and now I feel kinda of lost and back to square one with it all.

It’s been far too long since we’ve caught up with each other properly, so I thought it was about time I checked in on you to see how you are doing. I don’t like losing touch with my close friends, so let me start by apologising for my absence.\n\nWe’ve known each other for quite some time now haven’t we, how long has it been? I’d be lying if I said I could actually remember the first time we met.\nThe trouble with you - is I can’t see you, so it’s hard to know when you’ll show up,  rearing your ugly head as you do. \nAlthough that’s not an entirely accurate statement, is it?  The truly magical thing about you is that you have no head, no face, no body, nothing that I can actually distinguish you by, only your presence that you have always ever so confidently held. \nAnd yet, here I am , forced to face you, though you have no face to show. You, only ever show up as plainly ugly, headless and all.\n\nMaybe I should make that your new nickname. Ugly, I like it. What do you think about it?  Oh, Sorry, I forgot you cannot speak and, therefore, cannot have a say in the matter so I will help by deciding for you. Don’t worry it’s a good choice, It suits you, trust me - you’re welcome.\n\nI am writing you this long-overdue letter now because I have found myself at a pivotal time in my life where I’ve been left with no choice. I have embarked on a personal journey to reconcile with myself, the world around me, everyone and everything in it - including you.\n\nPlease do not be alarmed. I am not writing you this letter from a place of hatred or disdain, more rather from a place of reason, with a splash of comedic sarcasm to keep things light.\n\nWe have reached a point in our relationship\nwhere I feel It is now my duty to call you out on some of your behaviour. Please understand, I don’t believe I would be a good friend if I didn’t do this. \n\nFor too long have you had your domineering way with me and for too long have I sat in silence and done nothing. You have demonstrated, many times, an obscene level of manipulation and bullying that’s more often than not left me feeling scared, hopeless and full of distress. No more. \n\nHere I am now, confronting you, invisible as you are. No longer will I put up with your tormenting ways. No longer, can I accept the control, unrest and pain you’ve cast upon me. No more. \n\nUntil now, I hadn’t realised for how long I’d let you exploit me and how deeply this has affected my life. It’s not fair, it’s not kind and most importantly this is not your life to steer. I am the curator of my life - not you.\n\nLet’s be clear - friendship is mutual and voluntary, not a one-way street. While I still recognise you as my shadow companion, this relationship cannot continue with you at the wheel. \n\nWith this, I am now taking full control back. From now on, I will be the one driving. You no longer have the option to sit in the front or even choose a seat in the back - that’s my decision now.\nSo, I’ve decided, you can make yourself comfortable in the boot.\n\nDon’t worry, remember you lack all the qualities of a physical form so there’s plenty of space in there for you to relax and stretch your legs.. or whatever it is you have.\nTake a long rest my friend - you really do deserve it.\n\nAll the best,\nYour dear old friend,\nXXXX",

I also have autism and adhd\n\n  \nI've started my second year of uni. I was really looking forwad to coming back but instead I've relapsed into depression which is the worst in a couple years maybe. I've been off medication since february, i thought i was cured. \n\nIt was building over a few weeks and then a family member mentioned it, that I might be becoming depressed again, and i think since then I realised how unhappy I've been\n\nI live with other people, friends I met in first year, but tbh i don't feel like i have that much in common with them. Paradoxically I like my own company but then complain about feeling lonely. I think maybe a cause of my depression or at leats a recurring feature since as long as i can remember is that i feel the need to have someone in my life to feel fulfilled, a girl, or friends. I don't know why but its always been like that. i was dating a girl over the summer and it didnt work out, she didn't want to continue anything because i was going to uni. Then when I got to uni I met another girl on a dating app and it seemed to be going well but she had mental health issues herself, far worse than mine, and broke things off because she couldn't handle it.\n\nTruth is i was already feeling down before she ended it, I remembered actually telling her how i felt. Its just been building sicne then, I cry like every other day. Some days i feel okay and like i don't need help but then I have days like today where i wake up depressed and just can't get out of it. The other day i cried in the park. I haven't seen much of my main friend here because he's got a lot of other social commitments and now has a girlfriend. \n\nI just don't ever fele like i connect with anyone and i hate it\n\nI self reffered to the NHS which i'd been putting off for ages but I feel like a complete idiot for doing so...a 2 to 4 month wait just for video or telephone therapy. Wtf. Don't they realise these wait times are a death sentence for so many? I've been suicidal before and I sincerely hope i'm not again. \n\nI'm seeing the doctor tommorow. I really want to avoid antidepressants. I seem to already have erectile dysfunction which contributed quite a bit to the faliure of my only semi-serious relationship and has wrecked my confidence, and I know SSRIs are notorious for this. Aside from that, career wise I want to be in the police. Before uni I applied and they would not accept me unless I'd been off antidepressants for at least 2 years. So although the pain right now is bad, I know in the long term maybe i'd be better off without them, plus I don't want to rely on a medication like that. \n\nI know I seem to have issues with low vitamin D, I take daily pills but not sure if they're enough so I'm going to ask my doctor to do a blood test and also test for anything else too as it seems like this depression also manifests itself around this time of year. When I had my first major depressive episode aged 17 it was around October 2020, so it seems like lack of sunlight or the cold, rain, something like that contributes to depression. I also had a similar spell last year but it was nowhere near as bad. I try and go to the gym as much as I can and I feel good after that usually. My motivation is quite low right now though. I'm struggling to eat properly. I've also had problems with my skin which have also contributed to this, but other than that, there's no reason for me to feel depressed (and the other things i said). \n\nI just want to escape this vicious cycle of falling back into depression\n\nHow can I get the NHS to act faster without faking suicidal tendencies, I thought accepting video/telephone calls would mean I would get seen quicker.

I've been staying with family because I am unable to reliably feed myself and live independently. \n\nIt's not looking like I'll be able to return to work anytime soon and it looks like I may even need to start considering looking for some supported housing of some kind. It's incredibly difficult to secure such support if you've been living independently previously and appear intelligent and capable on the surface, as I do, so I'm actually close to just giving up on life because if I'm not going to be able to live independently then I can't really see much point in carrying on. It feels like my life has been stolen from me. I used to run 2 or 3 times a week and had good fitness but the meds have made me fat and I hate looking at myself in the mirror. I find myself wishing that euthanasia was an option because I can't live like this watching myself get progressively cognitively and physically incapable as some kind of detached observer with no power over it.\n\nI am in the position where I own my home outright due to my father's recent suicide but it's 200 miles from my family I'm staying with and I have no connections there following a 15 year relationship breakdown while I was in the psychiatric hospital and I can't live independently, so I can't even take advantage of that situation. I am literally unable to reliably feed myself or clean to meaningful degree. It seems like the support systems in society are not designed to provide for situations where people drastically lose their capabilities and it makes me sick.\n\nI have a huge sense of loss about my life and what it could have been if I didn't have all the conditions I have.

I'm very angry about all of the people who gave me the false encouragement that I was intelligent and could work in whatever field I wanted.

I was never sexually abused or saw my parents killed in front of me as a child, and while I didn't have the happiest childhood I keep thinking there are people that have it worse. Considering that the NHS is in crisis and there are people who are worse off than me, I feel like I'm wasting space/resources in the NHS.\n\nI've never committed suicide, and I wouldn't end myself impulsively.

I was on 50mg sertraline for a year but again felt it wasn't helping and so the GP suggested trying \"the big guns\" and initially suggested venlaflaxine(effexor) but changed mid appointment to mirtazapine because \"it's a safer drug\" but didn't explain what that means.\n\nI was prescribed 15mg of mirtazapine and started taking them on Tuesday, 4 days ago. I know it can take a while to start seeing the positive effects but I am severely struggling with the side effects.\n\nI was warned about the weight gain, especially since I am already overweight, but funnily enough I haven't really had an appetite. I have had some nausea and vomiting but nothing more than my untreated anxiety gave me.\n\nhowever the drowsiness is killing me. I struggled with insomnia and so the first night when I passed out 30 mins after taking the first pill I thought things were looking up. but since I woke up the next morning I've felt like I've been tranquilised. I don't think I've managed to stay awake for longer than 5 hours at any point. every movement feels like I'm dragging myself through mud, I'm shaking all the time and I'm having to concentrate to even focus my eyes. I've had conversations with family who have commented that it feels like I'm not actually there and I don't really remember what we talked about.\n\nI'm constantly feeling like I'm 5 drinks deep and I hate this more than when I'm unmedicated. I haven't had any side effects with any of the other drugs I've taken and so this has been really difficult.\n\nIs this something I have to push through to see the good side? I have a check up in 2 weeks to gauge how it's going but I don't know if I can last feeling like this for that long. Has anyone else had severe reactions and they've found the medication to work in the end?\n\nI know medications effect everyone differently but I'm hoping if someone else has a similar story it might help me mange to get through this 😅 thanks in advance!\n",

    "title": "Anyone had luck getting rTMS on the NHS",
    "selftext": "Hey,\n\nI have diagnoses of depression, anxiety, ASD, ADHD, and a personality disorder. I am treatment-resistant and I have been on 14 different medications (including ADHD meds) and none of them have ever helped. I have tried talk therapy, CBT, mindfulness/meditation, hypnotherapy, and art therapy and none of it helped. Both meds and therapy were done for the appropriate durations and dosages in all cases.\n\nSuffice to say, I am not in a good place and I haven't been happy for almost 15 years at this point. The first time I remember wanting to die was when I was about 10 and I'm now 24. There have only been a few periods in my life in which I wasn't suicidal since then (I am talking a couple of weeks) in at least a passive sense, and I have been mentally ill for the entire time without any breaks, of course. ADHD and Autism will be with me for life no matter what, but I cannot manage them at all.\n\nWith this in mind, I am thinking about more drastic measures. ECT scares me too much because of the memory loss it commonly causes, but rTMS seems much more tolerable with fewer side effects.\n\nThe problem is that it's insanely expensive privately. Well over £5k for one tranche of treatment-but also followups/maintenance sessions are also often needed. I have been at the max of my overdraft for ages now so I don't even have a spare £10 to spend, let alone £7000.\n\n-------------\n\n--------------\n\nThe other day I finally got a meeting with the NHS mental health team (not with a psychiatrist, of course, but with a mental health nurse who then gives their notes to a panel of psychiatrists, the results of which I'll get next Tuesday, supposedly). I emphasised that all previous medications had failed as had all the therapy I'd tried. I emphasised how suicidal I was and I talked about my timeline and vague plans (didn't want to get section'd), which I wont say here so I don't break the sub rules. I tried to emphasise that while I recognise things like rTMS are done as a last resort, I think I can be classed as such.  It is available in my area, I checked.\n\nThe mental health nurse (who was very lovely and gave me a lot of time, I will say) said that realistically, because most of my previous therapy wasn't on the NHS, they will want me to 'start from the beginning' again and it'll take perhaps 5+ years before they'd do rTMS. Likewise, I was told the waiting list for DBT on the NHS in my area is 2-3+ years. \n\nThis seems pretty insane to me as I have seen so many therapists already and I'm pretty damn confident that 10 sessions of talk therapy is not going to cure a 15 year mental illness FFS. \n\nSo I feel like I waited months for this appointment and it was a complete waste of time. I don't want to just try medication number 15 that probably wont work and I don't need any more talk therapy. I've tried it already so many times and it didn't work! Of course we'll have to wait and see what they give on Tuesday but the nurse didn't imbue me with a sense of optimism, to say the least.\n\n---------\n\nHas anyone ever succeeded in getting rTMS on the NHS? What condition were they in and what had they tried before? Were there any tactics necessary to work through the natural entropy and dismissiveness of the NHS MH system?",

    "selftext": "I don’t usually post these kinds of things but I know when I first started my Sertraline journey I relied so heavily on these types of posts so here goes. \n\nIt’s only when I compare my current self to my old self that I realise truly how unwell I was before sertraline and it’s bittersweet I must say, all those years I struggled through thinking it was normal to feel like I did makes me quite sad as man I wish I started this miracle drug 15 years ago so I didn’t ever have to suffer as much as I did. \n\nI have had crippling anxiety since I was 16, I have lost jobs, friends, relationships because of anxiety as I would struggle to leave the house at times and would lie about the reason why leading to people thinking I was just anti social, rude, a liar etc. I would have bouts of endless panic attacks coupled with severe months of depression and just horrible mental health. Fast forward to 30 and I THOUGHT I had it under control meaning I could hold down a job, occasionally go to social events albeit count down the minutes to when I could leave as I could not sit still and concentrate or enjoy anyone’s company, then out of nowhere, at work one day and I have the WORST panic attack of my life in front of a room of colleagues, the days following that were the worst I have had to the point I could not walk because of the tension in my legs from being so wound up, I could not even leave my home for a simple walk or speak to anyone other than my girlfriend without hyperventilating and I just felt so so weird all the time. \n\nEventually I felt suicidal for the first time in my life and this scared me, so I arranged an appointment with my GP and said I have had enough of this and came clean to my friends and family etc with the extent I was struggling and told them I was going to try medication for the first time and I was feeling extremely anxious about this so please give me space for a few weeks (basically leave me alone lol) and everybody was amazingly supportive and helpful and respectful. \n\nI picked up my prescription and after a few hours of apprehension took my first pill. I felt amazing 1 hour later, most likely a placebo, but amazing. This wore off the next day, then the day after that I felt okay again. The third day, well all I can say is, my doctor did not prepare me for this. I had the worst anxiety of my life, brain zaps, severe dizziness and diarrhoea, zero appetite and panic attacks at random times of the day and night, I was sleeping 12 hours a day and thought I was going insane at times. This lasted for around a week then in the following weeks I started to feel noticeably better each day. Within 3 weeks of starting most of the side effects wore off other than still feeling slightly anxious and nervous and tired, I wasn’t feeling 100% still so I upped my dose from 50 to 100. \n\nThe next 4 weeks was the strangest most amazing feeling I have ever had. Each day I was finding myself feeling better and better and not overthinking. Simple things like going to the shops weren’t a big task anymore and I would just get up and go without having any anxiety about it, stopping and speaking to a neighbour was seamless and I wouldn’t even notice until after how natural it was, I would catch myself thinking in ways I have never thought possible like planning trips and just getting up and doing things without worrying and over-planning. It was so strange (in a good way). \n\nIt has now been 8 months roughly and I feel the best I have ever felt. Sometimes I cry for the old me thinking about how much I used to struggle daily and just accepted it. It makes me so sad to know how awful things were for me prior to this miracle drug. The initial side effects WILL pass, yes they are horrific and they can seriously affect you but trust me, it will get better. I am now on 125mg which is my sweet spot. My life is amazing, I socialise with no issues, I eat better because I have the time to think, I sleep better, I look better, my girlfriend is happier, my family are happier, I have had TWO promotions at work, I can get my haircut without shaking and sweating. \n\nIf you are thinking of trying this drug because of anxiety all I can say is, please give it a try and give yourself the time to adjust. \n\nI’m sorry this is so long but I am so passionate about how life changing this drug has been for me. \n\nPS. I have to end on this, the Sertraline/Zoloft sh!ts are no joke, I was proud to say as an adult I had never sh!t myself….until 7/8 months ago…. you do the maths 😂 \n\n",

    "selftext": "Had my first IAPT appointment cancelled and missed the 7 day deadline (tf is 7 days? Like if you live alone and only have a conversation with another human every few months, 7 days isn't that long) to contact them back for a rebooking, due to personal problems. Re-referred, although I'm not sure if I can be accepted again within 6 months anyway.\n\nDo IAPT even help with things other than talking on the phone? Like actual general life help.\n\nIt's really fucking boring trying to get anything done here, from MH to the council's housing aid and DWP (who officially offer courses or other help, but hide most of it by not telling you about it). Every system is fake hope. A lot of people would actually be better off with zero systems in place, because they'd never let go of their own hardiness and drive to just get on with life, thinking they need to do that to get some extrinsic help and then find it isn't there but that their intrinsic strength has lessened so then they're actually worse off. The time wasted trying to get help could've been spent on pursuing something else. Eg the time wasted waiting for IAPT can be spent looking for other services instead. \"You have to want help\", \"asking for help is the first step\" or other platitudes are spread throughout society, which only make sense in a functional system. Asking for help is the first and last step. I see why people tax evade now.",

My boyfriend wants to run out to confront them, and I feel he is so angry that he could punch them. He says he can't control what happens when he confronts them, but I'm not sure how much he is speaking out of anger or whether he actually would. I beg him to stay inside. To my boyfriend, this is the worst thing in the world and his brain can't handle the idea of people 'getting away' with making him feel like this. It is half term and it has happened three times in the past two days and my bf says he has reached his breaking point. I feel like his ASD, ADHD, and potential BPD all swirl together and he runs on fight mode for about three days and can't see any long term consequences, just pure anger. He is in his 30s and could do damage to a teenager, and destroy his own life with the legal consequences. Are there any acute service that could help? I don't know if this is serious enough for sectioning but I really want to avoid that. He is not under any current care but I think he probably should be because he isn't functioning right. I was hoping urgent therapy sessions. Thank you in advance.\n\n  \nUpdate: Sorry I thought my post was deleted so I didn't see the replies but they are useful now! I managed to convince him to come away for a few days and so he isn't sitting in the dark waiting for more knocks, and he is a lot more relaxed and back to normal!

During my undergrad I finally got what I needed which was EMDR trauma therapy. It was amazing and I started to make so much progress. It was taking a long time due to the amount of trauma but also just how hard it was for me to relieve things. Everything came crashing down though because the therapist I was seeing got a different job and despite my therapy not having been completed I was discharged from the community mental health services.\n\nI did my best to cope on my own but ultimately couldn’t and asked the gp to refer me back to the community mental health team. I waited nearly two years to even hear back. Rang them three times to chase. When I finally reached the top of the waiting list I had turned 25 so could no longer access the service I had been referred to but they agreed to do the assessment to see if I would be suitable for the service. \n\nI can’t even explain how much of a joke the assessment was. The person doing it seemed to have no knowledge of how to do an assessment and just read off a piece of paper. This included asking me myself to say what my appearance and affect were and to decide my own level of risk. I always panic and downplay my level of risk because I am terrified of hospitalisation. Ultimately my referral was rejected.\n\nI was passed back to the GP and told to self refer for the lower intensity therapy service in My area. Had the initial assessment in June. They confirmed my suspicions that I was likely too sick for them to be able to make a massive difference and although they could offer EMDR this would be short term and for one issue and not the cptsd that I have.\n\nIt’s nearly 6 months later and I’m still on the waiting list.

    "selftext": "I'm unemployed and single (M37). I have suffered with anxiety and depression a long time I was first diagnosed and medicated at 15. I was on Prozac at 15 and eventually just stopped taking it and didn't go to the doctors for years. After a suicide attempt (one of a few) I was put on Citralopram which I now also do not take.  \nI have had face to face and online CBT where I was also diagnosed with PTSD from a rough childhood and have always suffered with at least minor agoraphobia especially on my own.  \nOne course of online CBT I had in 2020 was addressing my agoraphobia and PTSD. But as a lot of it was exposure therapy (going out shopping first with partner then alone etc) and Covid lockdowns started my therapist couldn't carry on the same plan.  \nI have had a lot of loss in recent years and now feel completely alone.  \nMy Dad went to Thailand for what was supposed to be a 3 month holiday in 2018 but ended up staying there and died there in August 2019.  \nI lived with both grandparents from 17 years old. Gran died in January 2020 from cancer and I stayed in the family home with my Grandad and ex partner.  \nIn that time my partner also became incredibly ill so I was sole career for both her and my Grandad. As my Grandad became more mentally ill it took its tole on my mental health and he died due to pneumonia in February 2023 he was in ill health from basically starving himself once he was taken into a home as I could no longer care for him. He was getting paranoid that me and my partner was trying to poison him by giving him his medication.  \nMy ex-partner (9 years)also ended up in a home in August 2023 as she now needs 24 hour medical care.  \nAs I was already struggling leaving the house alone she was my entire support up until she got ill and even after that she was at least here.  \nliving on my own visiting her became impossible and to be honest I was also angry with her.  \nI know its not her fault but still I felt abandoned completely. I was trying to build myself up over the last year. I have controlled my diet, gave up smoking cigarettes in January and started walking my dog further and further from my house getting to the point where I was out a hour or 2 at a time walking at least 10,000 steps a day and have lost 50kg in weight and although still very lonely was feeling a improvement in my mood.  \nOver the last month or 2 my anxiety and depression have been becoming full force again. (probably because like I said partner left a year ago in August and also spent my birthday alone in September).  \nWhilst walking my dog last week me and my dog were almost run over at a zebra crossing and I reacted by shouting \"your supposed to stop\" the car reversed and the passenger started telling me to shut up and threated to stab me and my dog.  \nI don't know why I did it I guess I was upset/annoyed or maybe my flight/fight response kicked in and I booted the car. The passenger jumped out started shouting and then went off about 10 minutes later I was walking home the car pulled up on me again the passenger jumped out and attacked me throwing one can of drink at me and breaking another over my head he had also called friends over so I was holding dog back with one arm holding him at bay with my left arm and  trying to watch 3 people and the dog at once.  \nI am completely uninjured although I was told me and my dog would have been stabbed and killed if I wasn't on a main road as passers by were thankfully intervening. Although obviously shaken I felt fine till I got home.  \nOnce I got home I had a full blown panic attack.  \nI now don't feel safe inside my house and I feel like I'm paranoid. I am struggling to eat or sleep and basically have stayed in bed the last few days.  \nI  have also had multiple panic attacks firstly trying to leave the house in 5 minute stints but now even opening the door for my dog to go toilet in front garden and around my home.  \nI now have a very small and mostly useless support network. I have also referred myself to the mental health services again but I don't feel like they have helped in the past. I feel completely alone and terrified and don't know where to turn. I'm hoping that writing out my feelings will at least help.  \nThe only thing stopping me going back down the suicide path is my dog. Which has also started having some behaviour issues which are adding to my anxiety but that's a whole separate post.\n\nEdit. 23/10/2024 8:40 am  \nHave now managed to build up the mental capacity (I don't know why I keep getting in my own way) and both booked my assessment with talking therapies' and used my G.P's triage system to contact my G.P. apparently it will be looked at in the next 2 days I guess I will find out what's going on from there.\n\nEdit. 23/10/2024 9:31 am  \nI'm utterly shocked I have just had a phone call from my G.P asking me to come in for a appointment at 11:40am today.. lets see how this goes.

    "selftext": "I was in psychiatric centre detainment unit on Monday 14th October 2024 - Thursday 18th October 2024. \nWe sat on bedsits in a all females room for most of the day being observed on cameras \"the whole time\" (I put brackets as I'd walk past the office sometimes and noone would be in there or monitoring the cctv). \nCome Wednesday night I saw a psychiatric doctor for the first time and she told me they were upping my meds and sending me home.\nI felt stuck, I'd had panic attacks while there and the only relief I had was that I had a doctor if something physical happened and a mental health professional if it was mental health related so there was always someone physically to go to and that I was being watched so I was safe from myself and my own mind/body.\nI've done my best to do as they've advised by taking my medication (40mg propanolol 3x a day, theyd upped this from 60mg to 80mg to 120mg in the space of a week). \nI'm trying to push through till Monday to see my psychologist for the first time as CMHT have gotten then involved but I feel like noone is listening to me with my needs and when I express that its still not heard.\nThey all tell me to go home and deal with it but I'm not dealing well with it at home at all and I feel I need to be taken out of the community, worked on with my mental and physical wellbeing while slowly reaccessing the community till I'm able to stabilise and manage again. \nMy anxiety is at an all time high, yes the medication does some of its part but at the same time I'm still suffering in my head yet I'm just too knocked up to do much about it. \nI feel like noone takes my opinions seriously, I feel treated like a little girl whose told to eat her candy and smile. \nSome of my friends are also suffering in the same boat as me, I don't wish to go back to the place I was at in fear of being turned away again and again like they did before I got a manager from the unit next door to have a word with them while I was manic.\nThat's the only reason I got a bed in the unit for a couple days and on the promise I wouldn't return there over the weekend (it's a mental health urgent assessment unit that you go to for an assessment and they can put you in the unit for a few days to be further assessed.. but it's rare they help you as they hate me there) coming to the Monday or access a&e or ring 999 for any reason. \nSo I couldn't attend the mental health place over the weekend if I had a breakdown I just had to deal with it, couldn't access any physical help and Lord forbid something bad had happened I couldn't of called 999 or the contract they made me sign for the promise of the bedsit on Monday would have become void.\nIf nowhere is listening and you feel you can't cope in the community and need hands on help 24/7... what do you do? \nI'm afraid.. I'm very scared and I feel so tired of trying to be heard.... \nThankyou x ",

    "selftext": "I've taken a few SSRI's now and I haven't found one that I've been able to use. Lots of stuff has happened and CMHT have let me down and I'm still battling to get help. Today with an out of hours service they said that I should be taking medication and the fact that I won't take it is being seen as \"refusing treatment\". I explained to them why I didn't want to take them and they said they understood but I don't think they did. \n\nI first tried Citalopram and I just felt like I was in a daze all of the time. I am someone who cries a lot and I somehow cried even more when I was on this. I didn't notice the side effects when I was on this it was my mum who spoke to me about it because she was concerned. \n\nI then tried sertraline and I was on this for over two years. I kept having issues with my periods while I was on this but my GP kept saying it was my weight and kept increasing the dosage until I was on the highest. I kept feeling more and more suicidal with each dose increase too. Long story short the last increase in them made the side effects so bad I had four ultrasounds, several blood tests, and ended up in a&e due to the pain I was in. \n\nThe next one I tried was Mirtazapine which made me sleep constantly. I slept for 17 hours straight, missed an entire shift at work, and just struggled with staying awake. \n\nThe last one I tried was Duloxetine which made me feel really sick and I had to be sent home from work. \n\nWhile under CMHT I was prescribed Venlafaxine but one of the side effects is weight gain and I don't want to take them. CMHT said they would monitor my appetite, but I have an eating disorder so it's not that simple, and they've discharged me now anyway. \n\nThe service I spoke to today said there are still medications that I can try but I really, really do not want to. I'm not against medication in anyway, I know it works for a lot of people I'm just concerned that SSRI's do not work for me. I don't think my diagnosis of depression is correct, and I live on my own now and I'm worried about the side effects. As with Citalopram, it took another person to point out the side effects to me because I was so spaced out. I don't have anyone around to do that anymore. I do have a different GP now, but I don't trust that they will take my concerns seriously about side effects. I think my weight is likely to always be blamed. I've experienced side effects with all of the ones I've tried, but none of them made me feel any better either. Like my suicidal thoughts didn't reduce, I still had panic attacks etc. \n\nHas anyone had any success with getting help without taking medication? \nIf I were to take them again does anyone have any tips to monitor/spot side effects? \nHow many SSRI's do people typically try before finding one that works? \n\nThanks and sorry for the long post \n\n",

Everything became very scary. I couldn't even speak or express an emotion. It was hell, at any moment there could be violence, mockery, or drug use, or obscene sexualised stuff.\n\nAt the time I got other physical symptoms too, including chronic abdominal pain (was on co-codamol for several months), terrible anxiety and a sense of being disconnected from my body.\n\nThe tiredness never lifted; now I'm in my 40s and it's the same.\n\nI received some CBT (didn't help), and a couple of years of psychodynamic therapy. The psychodynamic therapist suggested complex PTSD and schizoid personality disorder.\n\nI also had mindfulness therapy, which helped to eliminate the \"thought\" aspect of anxiety and open up a small space for calm, however being mindful and getting into a \"default\" space (being alone with myself with my feelings and body) brings about terrible sense of dread and terror, even with paranoia and frightening perceptual distortions (voices, movements).\n\nNone of the therapuetic modalities have explained or solved the tiredness. I've done hefty exercise, which helps in the short term, but within moments the sleepiness comes back.\n\nAs a kid and teen I was basically withdrawn all the time, daydreaming. I didn't pay attention in class and struggled to connect with peers. As a young adult it was the same - unable to keep up with social interactions, prone to zoning out.\n\nMy whole working life I've found being at work utterly draining and exhausting. For years, during the day, I have to take \"time out\" and go lie down. Luckily in my curent job there is a special room, which I'm always hogging, sometimes 4-5 times a day, because the anxiety, breathlessness, mind fog, headaches and chest pain get so intense.\n\nIt's like daily reality, and other people, and my own rollercoaster of emotions, are just too much for me to endure, and I just want to go to sleep. I lack positive emotions and feel depressed a lot, and feel as if there is a wound or hole of sadness in my chest. This may be due to the schizoid PD.\n\nIt's not like I think about the topic very much, as if to amplify it. It's a boring topic, but I nevertheless feel this way, regardless of whether I ignore it or not. I'm not going to gaslight myself that it doesn't exist, I tried that and it doesn't help.\n\nI've also done a ton of voluntary work and \"external/social meaning\" -type activities, in order to fill my conscious waking time with positive things, related to other people and larger concepts and values, that will distract my mind from how awful I always feel emotionally and physically. The symptoms persist through those activities, so I'm always engaging in an exhausting struggle. I never feel calm or comfortable, so nothing is fully enjoyable, I just go from one task to the next, unable to resonate with other people (I wish I could feel).\n\nDoes this resonate with you?

I was diagnosed bipolar at 17. my private psychiatrist deemed me too high risk for private outpatient psychiatry so referred me to SPA to refer to CMHT. I had an assessment with SPA but was admitted to hospital a couple weeks after and SPA discharged me without even  telling me 🫠 \n\nAfter a short stay in hospital I was referred to home treatment team (again) and my private psychiatrist sent a letter saying he would not take over RC duties for me. HTT tried to refer me to CMHT but they declined because they thought I still had a private psych, we then sent them that letter, but they declined again because I do ketamine treatment and that is off license for bipolar and they did not want to take responsibility. HTT said it would be inappropriate to discharge me to primary care but no one was stepping forward so I was literally discharged to no one with all these med changes I  supposed to make. \n\nI kept on doing ketamine treatment until weirdly, for the first time, it sent me hypomanic and then mixed. I contacted my old priv psych bc I literally had no one else and he referred me to crisis to HTT. A unanimous decision was made that I would stop ketamine, and if CMHT are true to their word they’ll take me on as a patient. So now I’m waiting for the HTT to talk to CMHT… \n\nI’m worried. Since I was 16 I’ve never solely been under public services, and my interactions with public services in Australia were awful. I have notoriously difficult to treat bipolar depression (like I’ve done meds, therapy, ECT… the whole works) and usually after I stop ketamine I fall into one of these episodes which  potentially become psychotic. Idk how they’re gonna treat that. All my doctors are telling me I need an MDT and that my condition is too complex for private… but I’ve read so much about   CMHT being terrible! \n\nso, my question is, does anyone who has bipolar or a similar severe illness find CMHT helpful? for those who have bipolar, what’s their general treatment plan?

    "selftext": "Context: I was diagnosed with DID over two years ago while living overseas but by a clinical psychologist who is a trauma and dissociation specialist and is registered with the BPS. \n\nWhen I moved to the UK just over a year ago my GP referred me to my local recovery team (I believe this is considered a CMHT but just under the name of recovery team) and through june and july I attended \n\nmultiple hour long sessions on a weekly badis where I was administered the SCID-D (an assessment for dissociative disorders like DID). I didnt know I was going to be taking the SCID-D until the first appointment where it began, and then in this time frame I had multiple crises occur, including a suicide attempt resulting in a day in A&E RESUS and being made homeless. I don't even remember most of the assessment sessions but I can't imagine I was in a great state to be talking about the symptoms I experience and have been experiencing for years.\n\n\nMy life more or less fell apart during the assessment and then thr assessment came back to say I did not have DID or any other SCID-D diagnosis and that I was simply too complex for them to diagnose but that theyd put me on the wait list for therapy. This resulted in more instability and another breakdown and I did request a second opinion but this was provided only based on the existing assessment. The second opinion also stated that I didnt provide enough specific examples of enough symptoms of amnesia which feels counterintuitive given that I have a documented history of having amnesia for my amnesia, and was not in a state where I would be remembering details like that.\n\nAs such I put in a request last week explaining why I think the assessment was not done in ideal conditions and isnt an accurate reflection of my condition and asking to be re assessed when stable and able to be more prepared, and provided a letter from the clinician who diagnosed me in support of my request. I've just been scheduled an appointment next week to discuss this and upon further enquiry been told that I will basically be given the opportunity to explain further why I think the assessment wasnt suitable and why I believe I do meet the criteria of DID.\n\nOver the last week or so I've compiled years worth of digital journalling and message historyy and various other evidence of my day to day experiences, and also synthesised highlights pertaining to each thing the SCID-D asks about and assesses for, and I've printed these all off into a5 coil binded documents in preparation to basically be able to be ready to fight my case. I also have copies of records from when I've previously had the MID administered multiple times over the last 4 years (I had a working dx of OSDD-1 prior to seeing the trauma and dissociation specialist who confirmed it was full blown DID). \n\nDespite the fact Ive already got a lot of documents and stuff in my favour, i'm wondering if anyone has any suggestions or advice of what else I might want to bring or prepare for with this.

I can only have one session a month with her as it's all I can afford. I hated every minute of it. The counsellor is really nice, she asked questions, explained how she works etc. But I am just so angry and upset that I'm back where I started. I spent over two years with my last counsellor and I feel really stupid for it. I feel stupid for believing her when she said CMHT would help me. The comments from her and comments from CMHT have left me feeling broken and like I am beyond help. I don't want to rip myself apart again trying to make things better for things to either not change or to get worse. \n\nI don't know what to do. I don't know if I should continue with the new private counsellor, try talking to someone else, or just give up with counselling. I don't know how to get rid of these feelings or how to stop feeling like I'm just constantly failing. I'm not sure that I can put in the work again. \n\nHas anyone had an experience similar to this?

Yesterday i was speaking to my cousin and she thinks i might have depression again. I'm autistic/ADHD too and i live with people, i'd consider them my friends but i don't ever really feel a part of anything. I started seeing this girl and i thought it was going great (only a few weeks tbf) but then she (has many issues of her own) just flipped and was like because of her issues couldn't commit etc etc. Three of my friends now have partners so i don't see as much of them as i'd like. Small things are sending me over the edge at the moment. My anxiety since coming off the medication has been terrible . I'm delaing with some health conditions with my skin at the moment and a coupl of othr things and that's getting me down a lot especially with worry. \n\nToday I just broke down and had a long cry for the first time properly in a very long time.

I drank, so much to hide the pain inside of me. What has scared me is 9 weeks ago I had huge hallucinations, I mean days of not reality but it was to me, still is now. I see it clearer than reality. I ended up in hospital with a broken foot and not clue of what happened. \n\nHas anyone else had this sort of thing? I won't go into detail as it would be pages of stuff, but me being mugged, I wasn't. I had left in bare feet, shorts and a t-shirt. ",

I actually used to get a bed at the children's ward and had frequent talks from nurses, mental health workers, and the crisis team saw me the following day and would assess my needs and get in contact with camhs and do a lot of work for me. About 3 months ago I was in hospital for self harm and needed stitches and I was taken to the adult's ward instead despite still being under 18 and the wound was treated but the service was horrible and I was kept in the waiting room the entire night and surrounded by people under arrest and in psychosis or mania and they didn't treat my injury very quickly at all despite not many people being there and the crisis team were awful and didn't seem to care at all about my safety and sent me back home despite being actively suicidal and it just makes me wonder whether there's any hope for the future when this is the kind of treatment adults get. I am 18 next year and have no idea what the point in making it that far is when I am always in so much pain and my mental health is not getting any better and this just proves it won't change when the treatment and services are getting more shit as I get older.

They are not covered by PALS. Obviously, the outcome of this wasn't great as the person I spoke to was the service manager and she cannot be impartial. She promised me things that haven't happened. They weren't vague requests, like they are quantifiable things but nope nothing. \n\nAt this point, I don't know what to do next.

Fundamentally, I just want help. \n\nDoes anyone have any ideas around where or to who I can take this? I'm honestly open to anything! \n\nIf you made it this far, thanks! 😅",

    "title": "Update on my mental health + other stuff",
    "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI have an update regarding my mental health. I’ve been keeping quite well for this last year and a half. I’ve accepted a lot of things and realised I will probably never get the right help unless I somehow managed to go for private treatment (which I cannot afford).\n\nHowever, I did see the psychiatrist and she isn’t going to lower my medication due to the thoughts. I’m not suicidal anymore (thank goodness), but I keep having really strange and unusual thoughts. Also, I’ve had really bad mood swings for a very long time. I am constantly tired and irritable. I do have OCD and autism diagnosed, but I went through a phase of what the psychiatrist believes was psychosis. I thought there were cameras in my room and have debilitating anxiety because of the anime/cartoon characters. I thought the fictional, drawn characters had feelings towards us humans. They were superior to us – they hated us humans. I don’t think this was OCD somehow. I’ve been told it was OCD by my psychologist, but I think the psychiatrist said it was psychosis. This happened many years ago though – I was under CAMHS at the time and they didn’t really do much. Also note, when I believed these thoughts, I was hardly medicated.\n\nHere and now, I am no longer suicidal and if I was, I would know who to phone. My mum would notice my emotions and feelings too. I am though, riddled with anxiety regarding the Russia invasion of Ukraine. I feel like the end is very near and there’s no point in making a life for myself because we will all be nuked. But then I think if I post this post, the Russians will see it and tell Putin to nuke the UK. I’m a bit nervous to post this to be honest. I also have thoughts about if I move away from my hometown that I’ll be poisoned by a landlord if I become a lodger. I feel like someone would be out to kill me for fun. These are just a few examples of the kind of thoughts that feel real – they cause me a lot of distress.\n\nDon’t get me wrong I know I not completely crazy because I know I have insight, but these thoughts feel very real and almost like it’s going to happen. If it’s not today, it might be tomorrow (in terms of Russia nuking us). I don’t understand how everyone is living their lives so normally. I feel like it’s the end for us all. I don’t understand it at all.\n\nI am on 60mg of Prozac and on 15mg of Aripiprazole. My GP lowered the Aripiprazole on the request of my psychologist and me. I also hate having to have blood tests every year, so that’s partly why I want to come off Aripiprazole. Also, I felt a bit pressured by my psychologist.\n\nI pretty much have all the signs of probably mild psychosis. I sleep 12+ hours a day, I do feel withdrawn from people, I feel a bit depressed and very anxious all the time, my mood swings like mad, I still eat a lot of food but have lost weight (I’m on Wegovy), I haven’t pursued my hobbies for weeks on end as I just don’t feel like it. Funny thing is though, I don’t feel like I want to die. I still do cry at times and get really emotional.\n\nShould I ask the psychiatrist to refer me to a different service? I don’t know what to do because I feel like I’m attention seeking but at the same time I feel like I want to be crazy. I don’t understand myself.",

    "selftext": "Honestly I feel pretty helpless in the situation, I (F21) have a close relationship with my sister (F24) and we literally tell each other everything and do so much together. We are basically best friends. Though things have been so rough recently that I don't really know what to do.\n\nMy sister has always struggled with her mental health, she was very quiet growing up and didn't like to talk much about herself. Me and her never had a good relationship growing up, but over the time she had a really bad friendship breakup that caused us to get close.\n\nShe has struggled with depression for a while now, she doesn't really have many friends and is highly paranoid about what other people think of her or their motives. She was never diagnosed with depression though, but she clearly showed symptoms of it. Didn't like to go outside, didn't want to make new friends, couldn't find happiness in anything. I remember a time where she told me that she felt like a robot because she couldn't feel anything, and couldn't cry. By the way my sister was involved in my parents divorce, and this was when we were both young, she was stoic and void of any emotion when it happened, even though she was the one helping my dad take his bags. She was also the one who was messaging my dad whatever my mum was saying.\n\nShe's always been working ever since leaving college, and helping maintain our family, and she lost her job a year ago, which I have realised took a toll on her mental health. She's gradually become more insecure and depressed as she feels no one wants her to work for them. Recently she's had spouts of what she likes to call mood blips, where she would feel angry, upset. annoyed for a certain amount of time, they would usually consist of bad thoughts, she told me she would sleep to try and cope with them. She also told me she would be scared to go outside because she wasn't sure she'd come back, because her tendencies would be so bad. She did try to get support for these mood blips, but the mental health core team, dismissed her and said she has nothing wrong with her.\n\nNow she's gotten worse, those blips are still there but she has struggled with brain fog, so severe she has forgotten normal things. She felt more stupid and incapable of doing anything, which leads to my next point. Her brain has slowed down, so she can't even keep a proper conversation because she forgets things because her brain blanks out. This has become so bad, that she has to use a cane to walk, and she's embarrassed to go outside because her brain has become slow to the point everything she does is slow. She had gone to the A&E recently, and the doctor there told her it's psychomotor retardation, and after that she went to the GP who referred her to the core team again.\n\nShe struggles to go outside and walk, and feels embarrassed by having to use a cane, she had gone today to an appointment at with the core team and the dude said to her that she's pretending to be ill to get attention from my family and saying she's faking the whole thing and she wouldn't get a diagnosis. Obviously I was pissed when I heard this, and my sister feels dismissed and hurt because this is the second time she has reached out for support, but no one wants to help her.\n\nAs a sister it breaks my heart to see her like this, she's 24 and should be thriving, living her life but she's stuck at home, worried if she'll be able to walk again, she's also having bad thoughts because she doesn't feel like she can do anything and I feel helpless, because I don't know what's wrong with her and I feel so hurt that the professionals in the NHS are turning her away.\n\nThis was a long story but also rant, any advice is open. I just want my sister to get better, I pray she does but that's all I can do for now, because the system has failed her, and I'm so scared of losing her to whatever this is.\n\nThank you for reading, I appreciate it highly.",

Over the years the mod team was expanded as the sub grew and myself and u/radpiglet came aboard. We are all people with lived experience of the system and MH issues. Earlier this year, u/ParanoiaDestroyer decided to leave Reddit permanently for their own wellbeing. We have tried our best to keep the legacy of the sub going and continue to foster a welcoming and safe community for patients, professionals, loved ones, or anyone who might stumble across the sub.  \nSince PD left we have worked hard to update and improve the sub. Some things we’re especially proud of is the new sub[ masterpost ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthUK/comments/1dkmvp9/rmentalhealthuk_masterpost/)and the regional offshoots. We also created a medication [masterpost](https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthUK/comments/1cy07pq/rmentalhealthuk_medication_masterpost/), a [sub rules FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthUK/comments/1f77gs8/sub_rules_faq/), and an updated post about resources for those dealing with [homelessness and issues around money and food](https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthUK/comments/1ei1k34/are_you_experiencing_issues_around_money_food_or/). \n\nOur projects that are currently in the works and hopefully coming soon include a comprehensive sub wiki, information about private healthcare and therapy, and an explanatory post about navigating the NHS system. If any professionals would like to contribute to the NHS system post, please drop us a modmail! We’d love to have you involved so we can make the post as informative and accurate as possible.  \n\nA huge thank you to every single person here. Truly. Whether you comment, post, or just lurk — thank you for being here.  \nWe have seen folks first post here at their very worst, and over time, seen them post about their recovery and progress, which is a real joy to see. So thank you to our contributors who have shared their journey with us and are now in a place to take the time to help and advise others. It’s really inspiring.  \nTo those who share their struggles on the sub and are having a tough time, please do keep reaching out for support. We hope the sub has helped you and will continue to do so. Progress isn’t linear, and either way we are really proud of everyone here who takes the sometimes daunting step of reaching out for help and advice.  \n\nTo our valued professional contributors who spend some of their free time helping others on this sub, we really appreciate you! In a system that can sometimes be hard and frustrating to navigate, you really do show great compassion and kindness and give people hope.  \n\nTo those who just read the sub, we hope you find the information, resources and the sharing of experiences helpful. You are always welcome to post or comment!  \n\nA big thank you again those who have joined the sub, we appreciate every single one of you for making this community so supportive and engaging.  \n\nLove,  \nu/Kellogzx and u/radpiglet  \n",

I can't exactly say I've led a charmed life, but I've tried to meander through it as best I can. Some may say that I've not done the best I possibly could - and, in certain aspects, they could be right. Maybe I've not understood the manuscript well enough to be able to understand life as I could do, and of course, there's going to be times where I do honestly wish either a) things could have gone better, or b) certain things wouldn't have happened for whatever reason. With all that being said, it's been... a journey, for want of a better word.\n\nThings didn't get off to a great start with life as such. I was a late developer when it came to my speech and early cognitive abilities; it wasn't until I was about 4 or 5 that I started forming better clarity with words at a younger age - and was in and out of child psychotherapy services as a result of it. These problems were prevalent until the age of 13, where I was diagnosed \\[by the CAMHS of the time\\] with Asperger's Syndrome. The only problem with this is that not a lot was fully known about Asperger's, autism or any similar kind of disorder, so there wasn't any kind of \"after-care\" as such available to me, so I had to \"fuck around and find out\" with it and just get on with life as best I could. Additionally, the family home was somewhat broken due to the fact that \"Dad\" (I'll touch on this later) cheated on Mum a few times over, and left misandry and chaos in his wake in a number of ways, so you can understand that things weren't easy on an overall scale.\n\nI had gotten through primary and secondary school (elementary/kindergarten and high school to you non-Brits) with varying degrees of success and headaches between 4 and 16 years of age, and went on to try and get through music college. Unfortunately, I ended up with a PhD in drinking and \"fuck it\" instead... this bit is largely forgotten, so forgive me if I digress somewhat. I do remember as such that secondary school felt like Alcatraz in a sense, and was pretty much the worst 5 years of adolescent life that I could imagine. That was mainly due to a select number of unforgiving teachers, but meh.\n\nI became a father at 22 to a wonderful daughter, but the thought of familial and relationship longevity was short-lived, as things became tempestuous in the household - and after having a couple of plates cracked over my head and slapped a few times, I decided enough was enough on that front and moved out of the house I was co-habiting with my fiancée and daughter. She moved back to her home down, whereas I went elsewhere for a few months to get a change of scenery and better myself somewhat (by going back to college and looking to get into the IT sector). My second child was born in 2005, and where possible, tried to make as much contact with both - as at that time, I still had some sort of relationship (more friendship than anything) with the now ex-partner for the sake of the kids.\n\nShe then decided that she was going to move down south as part of a new relationship she had - which strained things for some time between us. It meant that I couldn't see the kids as much as I wanted to any more, but I still strived to maintain contact (and have some sort of holiday time with them out of term times). Unfortunately, I ended up getting battered by her in 2007, and it sent me into what can only be described as hysterics... I only put my hands up as a \"whoa, hold up\" gesture, only to be punched and kicked repeatedly for my troubles. Things did improve a bit once the situation had died down and we both talked things over (and, after she was cheated on by said \"new\" partner and moved back to her hometown again), so there was a bit more contact with the kids from there, which was good and appreciated.\n\nThings meandered on for a couple of years to the end of 2010, where mum's health was deteriorating a bit due to her having a triple heart bypass and issues with mobility, so a decision was made to move to a bungalow for ease of access. However, this is where things started to take an absolute nosedive.\n\nWe found out that not only did \"Dad\" start cheating again - the irony of it was that the mistress was not only a) a family \"friend\" of approximately 20 years, but b) the landlady of the bungalow we had moved into - but also, we had discovered that in my adolescent years, he had been noncing\\* my sister and my cousin.\n\nAs you can imagine, this sent an absolute *shockwave* throughout the family as a whole, because nobody saw this coming. But, it wasn't everything that was about to come out of the woodwork.\n\nIt turns out that not only he had been noncing, my uncle also was as well. It turns out we had two nonces within one family.\n\nI was not only broken to find this out (as I'm sure mum was also) - but I was devastated, angry, numb... much more than those combined. To make matters worse, my ex-partner also thought that \"Dad\" was also doing it to them, to which I strongly refuted (mainly because I would have torn him limb from limb if ever the thought occurred - and also the kids had denied anything as such as well). This, as you can imagine - until solicitors and legal interventions were applied - made things so much more harder with life than anything I had every anticipated. As a result of this, I ended up having to move out of the \"family\" bungalow (mainly because \"he\" had kicked me out) and thanks to the local authority's Homeless Prevention Team I was sorted out with a 2-bed flat, which helped me get back on my feet. I ended up going through so much counselling and therapy on top of that as well to try and get me out of the hole that I found myself in over time.\n\nWe turn up to 2014, and as I was leaving for work one morning (managed to get back into full-time work after a three-year period due to the MH bugs), the neighbour in the downstairs flat wanted a word regarding a long-standing friend of mine that was living down and next door to us. Said friend had claimed that he was offered an IT job out of town, and went to go and take it. However, the neighbour had shown me a newspaper article from the local chronicle, which had stated that said \"friend\" was lifted for possessing indecent images. I'm stood there thinking \"oh, you're fucking joking, aren't you?\" - so I wanted to get out of there and move away sharpish so I could be away from another noncy type.\n\n**NB:** I managed to find out at a later point that said \"friend\" ended up having the shit kicked out of him once he'd reached the prison he was allocated to, as mum was still talking to \"him\" (I can understand why after many years of marriage and there was still some sort of feeling there) and \"he\" was at the same place. Karma's a beautiful thing in some sense... anyhoos, carrying on.\n\nManaged to get the new place, to where I finally found some sort of happiness a couple of years later, and eventually gets married. Additionally to this, I manage to end up getting living rights for the kids following their wish to remain with me after a relative's major birthday celebration, due to many issues with the mother (and stepfather, as she got married herself). It took some time to get everyone settled after that, but once the dust had settled, things were good for a couple of years.\n\nThe eldest eventually chose to move out and stay with her partner during COVID times, which I can understand - but from there, there was an added rollercoaster of events where she went through a period of substance abuse whilst staying at my niece's for a bit, as well as stealing money and effects from us and not paying her dues whilst bills were in my name, to the tune of just over a grand and half overall. We've not seen a penny of that, but she's now living away from us because she thinks that we're going to absolutely roast her when she comes back - but also she's sided once again with her biological mother, which makes things more difficult overall. My youngest is at uni these days and is doing better.\n\n*Although there have been issues between myself and my eldest, I still do miss having her around to talk to, because when she's in a good place, she's one of the best people to be around. I feel that her sense of judgement has been overshadowed, and has caused her to believe what she wants to instead of the actual happenings. It's a real shame, but I do hope that she comes to her senses and we can reconcile at some point.*\n\nI'd been in and out of therapy again due to a lot of heavy mental health issues with depression and anxiety - and I was finally diagnosed properly with Autism Spectrum Disorder towards the back end of 2021... just after my mother had passed away, following complications with health whilst under care following a fall she had in May of that year. As you can understand, this devastated me so much because my mother was an absolute rock to me in so many ways, and losing her cannot be fully described.\n\nBecause I was also \"medically retired\" by my employers as well at this time, you can imagine that things were even more difficult. I ended up having a stroke in March the following year, and a TIA (transient ischaemic attack) the following month, so I felt like I really didn't know which planet I was on, or where my life would take me next. After all the stresses I'd endured, and how my body had felt up to this point, I didn't know whether or not I had any kind of fight left in me... of course, there are the odd couple of times where I've felt that still, but nowhere near as bad as I had previously.\n\nThings constantly were on and off (mostly off) with MH teams in the local area, and as a result of this, I grew more and more frustrated with life, as I wasn't sure I would end up either a) finding any kind of \"decent\" health again, or b) being able to provide towards the familial home once again. Couple this with the fact that there were a lot of things being lost in translation at the time, too - as well as myself having very erratic sleeping patterns to boot - meant that tensions were getting strained in the home.\n\nThis all came to a head on NYD this year where I just stopped what I was doing in the house, got dressed, put my coat on and walked out of the house. My wife asked me what I was doing, but I just put my hand up to say \"no\", didn't say anything, and walked out into the pissing, cold rain. My mind at that time only had one thing in contention: taking a dip into the old canal in the local area and not resurfacing. I put my phone into \"do not disturb\" mode, turned all my notification volumes to off, and just kept on walking. Even the police were sending me texts to try and locate me, but I never answered them or clicked on the links... I just wanted to end it there and then because I couldn't take it any more.\n\nIt got to the point where I gave up on the idea because my sister found me in a bus shelter just around the corner from the canal area, and took me home. I couldn't speak for four days afterwards, to which I then tried ringing around the various MH teams in the area - including the \"crisis teams\" as well (which, were no help at all) until I got to the IAPTs folks... and one handler in particular, who literally ended up abusing me over the phone instead of actually helping - they also chose to ridicule my wife for being a mental health first aider at her workplace too, which as you can imagine, didn't go down well at all.\n\nI finally ended up getting an appointment with the core teams, but because I also ended up having a break down whilst on the way back home from one day out, I chose to stay at a hotel for a few days (which turned into a longer stay due to \"doom messaging\" between my wife and I and caused further tensions between us as a result). After a few days more, and we turned into February - I get into a disagreement with my youngest child, which then involves my wife, and in turn ends up with not only me punching my wife on the arm three times, but also striking my 18yo and knocking him into a doorframe. This sends me into absolute delirium as a result, and gets the police involved due to its nature. I end up spending the night in the local constabulary because of it, and I know I can't go back home due to what happened (which, for the record - I'm not proud of and have full remorse for because it's something I've done which I don't believe in happening and I'm broken because it's happened) so manage to sort out some help via hotel rooms, a good friend and eventually manage to find a place of my own to stay at.\n\nThanks to another friend, I managed to get myself a bar job (to which I got promoted to a supervisor), as well as a place at a local recovery college to undergo some courses and improve things in myself. I also attended a local men's gathering as well (Andy's Man Club) so that I can try to seek further help in getting my issues out in the open, so that they're not as heavy to deal with any more. Added to this, I've been through a wonderful social prescriber in order to get through to more outlets for betterment, and weight management departments locally so that I can try and get sorted out with better health (even though I'm still in and out of cardiology to sort out arterial issues following my strokes a couple of years ago). I'm literally trying to do EVERYTHING - and then some - in order to not just better myself, but to be able to reconcile in respect of my wife and family.\n\nSince then, I've also found out that the father of my youngest niece and nephew - as well as two other \"friends\" - have also been noncing around. Needless to say that this brought back flashbacks of everything that kicked off in 2011 when all of the initial problems were brought up, and as a result sent me back a bit when they were revealed. Luckily, I've managed to get the help before it got worse, and avoided the slip back down the slope to where I was at the beginning of the year.\n\nI've learned to try and communicate better - even though there's still work to be done, and I'm seeking that help to be better - but I know that I still have struggles in respect of processing certain things as time goes by. I get that I'm probably not the best to explain things at times, either, which can make things difficult... but I am trying.\n\nThe long and short of this is: no matter what it is that you're going through - and no matter however hard it can be, there are outlets and organisations (given the time and effort) that can help you manage to weather the stormiest of seas. As you can imagine, I've struggled a LOT in dealing with certain things, and I admit that in certain areas, I could have done better. Additionally, I wish I could have found certain help sooner - and I do wish also that certain organisations could have helped me better in some situations as well, as things weren't particularly clear when I spoke to them about everything in the first instance. Whether or not there were some wires crossed, or something had been lost in translation and misunderstood - I'm not completely sure. The fact of the matter is that I'm trying so fucking hard to be a better person, but it's not just down to me to be better - we all have an air of responsibility to do so.\n\nAm I proud of what happened for certain things that went well? Not fully.  \nAm I proud of the shitty things that I've done? Most certainly not.  \nAm I remorseful for the horrible things that I caused? Most definitely.  \nAm I ashamed of that time in February? Yes, because due to what happened at that altercation, I feel like I became something that I truly detest.  \nDo I want to have the best possible outcome for everybody? Naturally, yes.  \nDo I want to be able to progress and do the best I can - not just for me, but for those closest to me? Yes.\n\nThere \\*is\\* a light at the end of the tunnel. However you get to that light is down to you. Just remember that there are people and organisations that can help you out, and in time, things *will* get better.\n\n\\*Nonce/noncing - UK slang for a paedophile/molester of non-adults",

    "selftext": "I have a part-time coworker from China who is going through a really tough time with her mental health. She graduated from MA over a year ago and has been unemployed since. I mean, in the sense that she hasn't been able to land the job she wants. She seems to have lost hope, I remember how her facial expression changed over the past year. At first, she was warm and cheerful, but gradually she stopped smiling and began to speak pessimistically. She mentioned that going to concerts is the only thing keeping her going right now. She says she wants to stop lazing around and doing nothing when she doesn't have work.\n\nI suggested she consider therapy based on my experience of recovering from depression, so it's obvious but I believe it works. But she doesn't seem interested. She's under a lot of pressure and worries that if she returns to China, no one will hire someone with such a long employment gap. I mean in her career. Lately, she's been making jokes about dying painlessly, which makes me think she might be in the early stages of depression, or perhaps it's more serious. \n\nGiven her upbringing, she has grown up in China's academically competitive society, with parents who are highly enthusiastic about education. She knows only a life of climbing the ladder—believing that graduating from a top university and securing a high-status profession is the sole definition of success. She thinks herself failure because of this. \n\nSince she was studying abroad and is now in the UK, she doesn't have to be under the pressures of Chinese culture; these are pressures she's creating within her own mind. Therefore, she doesn't have to be comparing herself to chinese people who have studied and found jobs in China. I think her mental suffering comes from comparing herself to others. I understand her feelings painfully well because I was depressed for about three years for exactly the same reasons.  Everyone's life are different, and if you grow up, there's not really a guided path that everyone follow, you ought to create life yourself. So comparing with others is not really useful, that's what I came to the realisation and it took a lot of time. \n\nThe field she's aiming for is psychology related to art, which is quite specialized, so I can't advise her from an employment perspective. However, if she tries for a year and it doesn't work out, I think it's okay for her to return home. It's tough for a foreigner who is not a native English speaker and a recent graduate with little experience to be hired in the UK. However, I think there may still be opportunities in her own country where she can make use of her English.\n\nI really want to support her, but I'm not sure how to listen or what advice to give. Has anyone experienced something similar or have suggestions on how I can help her?",

    "selftext": "I am someone who has a history of poor mental health. I underwent CBT for panic attacks a few years ago which was helpful - for a while my symptoms completely stopped, then they reemerged but were manageable, and then I've had lots of on/off periods where I'm either completely fine or really struggling with it. For the last year and a half I have been struggling with depression. I contacted my university GP when I started experiencing these feelings, because they were also impacting my panic attack symptoms. I was offered anti-depressants, but rejected these because I said I'd prefer a therapy route because of my success with it before. Life got in the way and I never followed through on therapy, and when I handed in my dissertation my mood briefly improved so I convinced myself it was just stress. \n\nAfter finishing uni my depression worsened and was further impacted by life changes: transition out of uni, moving back home, struggling to find work, my mum attempting to end her life, etc. It's impacted my job search and made me isolate myself. I re-registered with my home GP, self-referred for local therapy, but realised I just don't feel level-headed enough to engaged with therapy. With my past experiences, even at peak anxiety I wasn't depressed and was feeling optimistic about therapy. Now I feel like I'm in a completely different boat and feel completely disillusioned by the idea after seeing the standard of local support my mum received despite her much more severe situation. \n\nSo I decided to book an appointment with my GP. I did so through the NHS app as my practice has a system whereby you can submit an online consultation that is then triaged and you are messaged with an appointment time to avoid 8am rush. I was given an out of hours enhanced access appointment by phone. I outlined my above history with the doctor, making sure to mention that I have experienced therapy before, been offered antidepressants before, and had self-referred to the local IAPT service. Doctor asked me zero questions about my symptoms and how they impact my day to day life, and hadn't seen my consultation form so had no prior knowledge of these to justify this. I was just told to self-refer to the service I had already self-referred to. When I said I wasn't feeling particularly level-headed about my depression and enquired about taking medication alongside therapy or prior to engaging with therapy, I was told this wasn't an option and the local norm was to only prescribe if therapy had been unsuccessful.\n\nI felt like this doctor didn't listen to me at all and I was wondering if anyone had any advice or similar experiences with doctors refusing to prescribe antidepressants?",

Only about a week or so ago I found out that the liquid version had been discontinued because it was too expensive and the alternative was an oral solution, where you have to mix the liquid into water or juice and drink it. Unfortunately this solution is absolutely horrific- like drinking radioactive waste. I don’t drink but my parents said it tastes like neat vodka, (ew) it also makes my mouth and lips burn and feel numb. It’s genuinely undrinkable. After talking to my doctor she actually said that there had been so many complaints that the pharmacy are probably going to end up discontinuing it because it’s so horrific.\n\nAnyway, because it is so bad and I genuinely cannot stomach it for much longer, my doctor is going to have me come off sertraline and go on Fluexitine (which thankfully comes in a liquid form) all within the space of one week. \n\nBefore all this happened I was on 200mg, however yesterday I have started to reduce my dose to 100mg.

    "selftext": "Hi, I hope this forum can help as I'm not quite sure what to do about this situation. Many years ago, I spent a few months in Australia, during which time my mental health dipped a lot. I had 2 A&E admissions for overdoses, and at each admission, a random doctor I'd never seen before gave me a diagnosis (one said BPD, one said Bipolar 2) based on maybe ten minutes of conversation. I believe these assessments were done incorrectly, for example I'd just started antidepressants, and the diagnostic guidelines for bipolar indicate that you shouldn't give a diagnosis of bipolar within a certain time frame of starting antidepressants because of the side effects they can have on mood. \n\nWhen I was going back to the UK a few weeks later, they gave me a letter with these diagnoses, because they'd started me on anti-psychotics. This just got entered onto my NHS records by my GP, no proper assessment by a psychiatrist here. They left me on the medication with no supervision, and after about a year I stopped taking them due to a bout of stomach flu and never looked back. I have never needed medication again, I see a therapist for depression, and through that believe that cPTSD is a more appropriate diagnosis - though I've never been given it officially. \n\nI want to get bipolar and BPD removed from my NHS record as they're really obviously not correct at this point, and having it on my record is affecting things I want to do (for example, some training that won't admit people with bipolar). \n\nIs there any way I can ask to be properly assessed and have the diagnoses updated? Can I pay to go through a private psychiatrist to do this? Any help or advice gratefully received! ",

    "title": "Need Advice for Overcoming Anxiety and Life Skill Issues",
    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI hope it’s okay to share my story here. I’m really struggling and could use some support and advice. I was raised by a narcissistic mother in Bangladesh, and I’ve faced mental abuse from her my whole life. This has left me with low confidence, serious anxiety, and mild depression. Growing up, I didn’t socialize much, and because of my mother’s controlling nature, I missed out on learning basic life skills during my boyhood and teenage years.\n\nSince moving to the UK, I’ve finally started to learn things like cooking, which felt like a huge step for me. But even simple tasks can be overwhelming. For example, tying my shoes can take me a long time, and I still struggle with basic self-care. One of the biggest challenges I face is my decision-making. I often make very poor choices. Like, if I need to go from point A to C and I know I should go through B, somehow I’ll end up taking a completely different path. It’s incredibly frustrating because I don’t always get to C, and it makes me feel lost.\n\nI got married recently to my amazing wife, who is the love of my life, but I wasn’t mentally mature when we tied the knot. Now that we’re building a life together, I realize I have so much to learn. I have this dream of becoming a father, but my lack of self-awareness and decision-making skills makes both my wife and me hesitant. If I can’t take responsibility now, how will I manage a child?\n\nI feel fatigued, tired, and demotivated all the time. I’ve talked to a medical professional, and I was diagnosed with low folic acid and vitamin D, which they said could contribute to my headaches and fatigue. I often suffer from migraines and sinusitis, which don’t help my mental state either. I have trouble remembering important things, crucial steps in daily tasks, and it upsets my wife. It’s tough to see how this impacts her, and I want to do better for both of us.\n\nI also have significant anxiety when it comes to talking to new people. I avoid social situations as much as possible, and if there’s a group meeting, I find it hard to speak up even if I have questions. I bite my nails and the skin around my fingers constantly, which is another sign of my anxiety. I’ve even taken therapy sessions in the past for psychosexual issues, including struggles with fantasy, porn addiction, and masturbation.\n\nNow that I’m in the UK and no longer under my mother’s control, I’m trying to stand on my own two feet. But I’m afraid to take jobs that require physical or technical skills—like making burgers—because I worry that I might mess up and get scolded or fired. The lack of self-confidence is paralyzing.\n\nI’m reaching out to see if anyone has been through something similar or has advice on how to build confidence, improve decision-making, and navigate these challenges. I really need some guidance right now.\n\n**TL;DR:** I’m struggling with anxiety, poor decision-making, and basic life skills due to a difficult upbringing with a narcissistic mother in Bangladesh. I dream of being a father, but my lack of self-awareness and responsibility makes both me and my wife hesitant. I’m desperate for advice on building confidence and improving my life.",

    "selftext": "On the one hand I'm very fortunate to live close to an NHS TMS centre, on the other hand I'm very unfortunate to live on a county border and the TMS clinic is on the wrong side of that border. \n\nYou can self refer, so I did, and the nurse has come back to say I need to get my GP to ask the board to fund for out of area treatment. But I'm really worried about asking. \n\nTMS is indicated for treatment resistant depression. I've been having mental health treatment for 25 years and things only get worse. I've tried almost all the pills and almost all the therapies. Overall, therapies were more helpful in the long run and pills have sometimes had short lived benefits, other times no benefit, other times make things worse. I have incredible trouble getting off them but most doctors don't believe in discontinuation syndrome. \n\nI've been trying to avoid my GP as I don't want to get into yet another conversation about why I won't try more pills. The only ones left I haven't tried are Duloxetine and Mirtazipine. I have a history of anorexia and struggle with hypersomnia so I'm really worried about Mirtazipine. Some GPs get this and others find it infuriating. I had a horrible time on Venlafaxine so I'm worried about Duloxetine too. But beyond that, I just feel like we're flogging a dead horse. If the last 10 medications were no good and I found them difficult to tolerate, why risk another?\n\nI think I'm just worried that if I go to my GP and ask for an out of area referral it's going to open a can of worms. I'm not really believed about my experiences with medications and although some doctors are polite about it, it just doesn't feel nice, so I learned a long time ago to just hide this stuff from them so I can avoid a conversation where I feel I have to politely agree with them that it was probably all because of an underlying disorder when my first hand experience doesn't really bear that out. I'm not anti-psych or anything, I just don't think the pills agree with me. \n\nTo make matters worse, the only contact with this GP I've ever had is because after I finally got off sertraline I didn't get my sexual function back. I waited a year after discontinuing thinking it was just taking a while then after a year I worried about it and went to the GP to have every physical cause ruled out. This has been a really unpleasant process and I'm really embarrassed to see them again. I was really upset (crying) in my first appointment about it (the dysfunction is severe so at the moment I can't have a sex life and haven't been able to since before I took Sertraline 7 years ago). Anyway, I think me being so upset was a bad first impression so they've got a bit of an attitude with me now- like, you know, \"oh here she is coming to me with some nonsense again\" and I find it embarrassing. She literally opened my last appointment saying \"what exactly do you expect us to do about it?\" and that was before they'd even done the blood tests to rule out any physical contributors. \n\nOh and worse again, she ordered a brain scan and I didn't attend. I was struggling really badly with my mental health and there was this list of stuff I had to do before the scan and I found it overwhelming so I avoided it, and that's completely my fault, but I haven't seen her since then. \n\nAnyway, this is just a rant. I need to just try and feel less ashamed and try to stand in my corner. I just really hate seeing doctors and I get really anxious about how embarrassing the experience might be. But I don't know for sure it will be embarrassing and asking for TMS might actually result in a treatment that works. I just need to be a bit braver!",

    "selftext": "Disclaimer: I am no doctor, medical professional or pharmacologist, there may be glaring inaccuracies here however I'm going by the fact that psychiatrists have wanted to prescribe this for me but couldn't. Bupropion isn't a miracle drug but I feel like it should be an option. \n\nTL:DR Bupropion is an atypical antidepressant that can boost energy and motivation with fewer side effects often associated with SRIs, but the NHS won't prescribe it for anything but smoking cessation even though some psychiatrists want to offer it for depression but can't because the NHS is more cautious than a chicken in a fox's den. \n\n\nFor those who may not have heard of this antidepressant, Bupropion is an atypical antidepressant, which means that it works differently than most classical antidepressants.\n\nSSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors) target serotonin, which the serotonin theory stipulates is lacking in depressed patients. SNRIs also exist, which target noradrenaline, are supposed to possibly improve energy and alertness; however, it still heavily targets serotonin. You're all probably familiar with the myriad of side effects that can severely reduce its effectiveness in many patients.  \n\nThese include:  \n- Apathy  \n- Sexual side effects  \n- Cognitive issues (fog/concentration)  \n- Antidepressant Withdrawal Syndrome  \n- Lethargy  \n- ...among many others  \n\nSo why is Bupropion any different? Well, Bupropion works completely differently. Actually, it doesn't even touch serotonin. Bupropion is an NDRI (Noradrenaline and Dopamine Reuptake Inhibitor) which has been found to sometimes be quite effective in specifically treating the staple motivation and energy issues with depression and is a more common prescription in countries outside the UK. It doesn't typically have most of the aforementioned side effects, like sexual dysfunction and apathy, making it an almost perfect option for people to try if they struggle with those issues.  \n\nWell, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency decided that the data is insufficient regarding its efficacy in depression, even though it's approved in the US, Canada, Australia, Germany, and Spain. I feel like it should be reconsidered. \n\n\n",

    "title": "Can IAPT refer to CMHT? Also do IAPT do anything related to abuse? It seems like it would be potentially catastrophic for people who don't have grounding/stabilisation techniques",
    "selftext": "My friend and his bro have been with the CMHT for a while now (my friend's mum had to push hard for his when the GP was fobbing them off, then his brother eventually got it after a couple tries talking to GPs). My friend last year said I ought to be with CMHT. I have to self-advocate though (already tried getting a GP appointment to discuss MH and social prescribing, but just got a template text message with the IAPT link).\n\nI'm with IAPT and meant to start phone therapy within two weeks (not keen on phone therapy since it's not that therapeutic, like talking in person is much better for interpersonal trauma IME, but I'll try to make their job easy). It's basically mostly for post-trauma/abuse (for the first 20+ years) stuff, or at least that's what I'm hoping (they seem ignorant asf so far, based on the initial intake process. Like lying by claiming to have discussed stuff with me, plus finishing the call when I was less than halfway through talking about childhood abuse, asking me what I want to work on and then ignoring it and sticking me on the pile for depression and if I'm lucky anxiety - I already know I don't relate to most online posts about depression, social anxiety or anxiety, since it 90% stems from abuse-related issues). I'm very self-aware, in decent detail, of where my issues come from (according to me and others I've spoken to), although I'm quite unaware of my own emotions and bodily sensations and I temporarily forget my previous analyses, even though they're in my mind.\n\nWhen I first tried to get help for this stuff several years ago, I was way too bad to feel safe (lack of trust to disclose things especially to men, scared of being told it was all just normal childhood) or be safe (high risk of retraumatising and spiralling if I undid my dissociation and was already suicidal) to engage with services. At that time I had pretty clear emotional flashbacks, derealisation/depersonalisation, poor posture, OCD (not the fashionable kind), eating issues (was violently force fed as a kid), BDD, startling, hypervigilance and a couple leftover physical health issues stemming from clothing and medical neglect. Now I'm definitely more mild and don't seem to have most of those symptoms, due to self-therapy (reading, sports, engaging with relatable fiction, having some positive experiences with others, exposure therapy I thought of myself eg purposely dropping plastic dishes to stop being paralysed due to fear of mistakes, since I was hit for mistakes or for pausing to think of the right option - double bind, gets you to freeze up and just be helpless), although idk if I do have them more than I know, but feel like they're gone because it's so improved or if things will resurface in certain situations. Mostly I just have loads of anhedonia, interpersonal and communication difficulties (which have affected all aspects of my life and are almost all stemming from abuse. Like not relating to others' experiences and having to hide that since people don't understand, having incorrect expectations of how others think or of how they want me to act. Eg recently being called out for me not apologising, whereas growing up I was usually hit for apologising (and sometimes for not apologising. Lots of double binds) so unsurprisingly I figure that people might get mad about receiving an apology. That's a simple to understand example, others are too complicated for a reddit post, some are more a subconscious block but where I often know the origin. A lot of problems being able to communicate with people who have any life power over me, because I know I can't just burn the bridge if I piss them off).\n\nSo now I think I might not meet the threshold to get any help now, at least in the NHS. I've been looking at low-cost charities a local non-NHS triage recommended me for face-to-face therapy (had to put it on the back burner for now as I'm being made homeless this month. Waiting for the bailiffs to contact me. Genuinely doubt I'd be in this crisis if I'd had MH-related help years ago when I tried it), but I guess the NHS is more official.",

I get visted everyday by home treatment team and everyone I’ve spoke to just say yeah well just take it it could help. \n\nI’m telling them I’m already struggling with my physical symptoms of dizziness which is one of the reasons I’ve been so bad mentally. But nobody cares. I’ve been told duloxetine is similar to Venlafaxine which did not work for me and was the worst thing to come off of for me. I don’t know what to do. I’ve been so stressed about it and crying so much but nobody’s listening to me. I’m just not being listened to. \n\nI don’t know what anyone’s experience with Home Treatment Team. I’ve never heard of them until last week but right now I’m struggling to see what they are here to do? So far I’ve have different people see me who haven’t a clue what’s been going on. Unsure why I’ve had an assesment because nobody knows anything and I have to repeat myself every single day. They ask what’s going on i explain myself then the day I encourage you to have hope and to take the medication ask me what I’m doing today and leave. I have to explain myself every single day. It’s draining & stressful. I asked to be seen before 12 cause I get really anxious waiting around. One person tells me if I have plans we can change the appointment to a telephone call another person is telling me that it’s against protocol to not see me and I have to be at home to see them. It’s all very confusing and I’m struggling to see the benefits.\n\nTL;DR don’t want to take medication as im too sensitive to tablets & trialed 5 anti depressants already. I express this all the time but nobody is listening ",

The mental health nurse put me down as \"low risk\" as despite having daily, frequent thoughts of self harm/suicide I haven't acted on those thoughts for 3-4 years or so now.

I do not have worth, I do not have a right to be here. \nNow obviously friends and family will tell me I do, but they’re saying that because they love me. It’s biased. A professional is going to tell me I have value because that’s their job. They’re not exactly neutral either, they’re not going to tell a suicidal person they don’t have value. A stranger is likely is tell me I have value, despite not knowing anything about me so their opinion holds no weight. Everyone is biased in some way, no one is truly neutral. I almost want to ask people that don’t like me, friends that once were, as they will give me the harshest truth but I can’t exactly do that. Don’t get me wrong I’m not looking for confirmation bias, just a fully truthful opinion. \n\nI’ve been trying to look after myself and hoping the mental health would follow but that’s just not happening. I’m getting out, I’m doing exercise and I’ve lost 10lb in 5 weeks. I should be feeling great, but I’m feeling just as lost and hopeless as I was in January.

He works full time.\nI work full time in a very busy, stressful job in a Health & Safety mid-management role. The job itself is (and used to be) 2 peoples' jobs. The Senior Managers are inconsistent, poor, unsupportive and lack the required technical knowledge or experience. Until May I didn't have any direct support and was working crazy hours to keep everything running. I stupidly thought this would be recognised/appreciated and think I ran myself into the ground.\nFollowing the appointment of a new boss and a slight restructure I had a small team assigned, although they came with additional workstreams aswell as the additional line/team management duties that I'm now required to do, 1-2-1's, reviews, team meetings, development plans etc.... All bar one of the team have low competency and a high workload and two of the staff are part-time. \nI'm burnt out, overwhelmed, behind on everything and stressed beyond recognition.\n\nI've just handed my notice in after 9 years with the company and 2 years in my current role. I don't currently have anything lined up (which is stupid with a mortgage to pay) and am conscious that's it's the most money I've ever earnt in my life, on the face of it (and for most other colleagues) it's a good place to work, with good benefits and I'm just giving up and walking away :(\n\nI'm looking for something else but I had an interview yesterday after a successful application and completely messed it up. None of my answers were succinct or particularly coherent and I panicked and completely floundered when I got caught out by a few of the technical questions, displaying very poor verbal communication skills.\n\nI've lost all executive function, I no longer have the ability to multi-task e.g write notes whilst talking/in a meeting, I have zero concept of time (and am usually now always running late), things take me a long time to do, whilst I don't generally have an issue with remembering things, I'll forget what I've already said to people and repeat myself - it's like I'm not present enough to remember. My handwriting when writing at the same time as doing anything else is REALLY messy and all over the page, yet if I'm just writing (e.g making a shopping list) it's different/okay.\nI just seem to have lost all basic brain function as well as communication skills and I don't know when/why.\n\nIt sounds silly but I also don't have that little subconscious voice anymore that tells you what to do and drives you,\nmy thoughts are always racing but seemingly just with pointless noise and overthinking.\nI have a total lack of initiative and motivation, to the point where I'm now also struggling just to get out of bed each day. Sometimes I don't manage it on days off, they're wholly unproductive and have been for a while, despite lots of things needing to be done at the weekend due to working full time - housework, laundry, shopping, life admin etc...\n\nI just feel like a shell of myself, an utter potato 🥔 , and I've actively lost abilities and skills I used to be proud of that made me the efficient, successful and productive queen that I was. \n\nI don't really know what I'm asking, just for any thoughts and advice I guess 🤷‍♀️ \nTIA 💜",

    "selftext": "I genuinely do not want to be alive. I have no immediate plans but I'm in a very low mood. \n\nMy OCD is unmanageable. I have no money because it's all been spent on my OCD. I feel that the floor in the house and the floor outside the family home is contaminated with poison. I buy gloves online and the delivery drivers put the boxes on the floor so I can't use those gloves, and have to buy more. \n\nI stopped doing that because I realised they're going to keep putting them on the floor so I buy gloves from a grocery store with the caveat being they cost £9 a box and you only get 40 pairs of gloves. \n\nThe oven broke in the house and that's the main thing I used to cook food. All I eat are ready meals and pre packaged food because I can't cook in the kitchen, and even then I mostly just eat crisps and biscuits so I don't have to go through the routine of wearing gloves and washing my hands 1000x just to use things. \n\nI haven't showered since the 3rd of August. I hadn't left the house since the 3rd of August, until Thursday when I saw a psychiatrist. And before the 3rd of August it had been months since I left the house because of BDD, and the OCD makes me look awful so I never go outside. \n\nI was already at high risk of periodontal disease because of mental health and haven't brushed my teeth in a month because I can no longer use the bucket and kettle I was using in order to brush my teeth. \n\nI'm in pain. I'm always hungry. My eating is terrible as it is and I've gone back to barely eating because of this situation. \n\nI used my last bit of money today to buy myself bits to eat until I get some more money and the delivery driver handled it in a way that made me think it's contaminated so I can't eat any of it anyway. Just fucking why!!!!!! \n\nI hate ordering in food because interacting with the delivery drivers is very triggering and I have anxiety and panic any time the bell goes off because I hate interacting with them that much. And unfortunately I'm pretty much ordering things every day. I can't do my own shopping because I can't go outside. \n\nI'm just fucking stuck. \n\nWhen I saw the psychiatrist I told him everything that's happening, the severe self-neglect (as much as I could, because I have other severe mental health issues). \n\nAnd I just feel like he's not understanding the situation. He recommended I be put on Clomipramine because I've been on various SSRIs including mirtazapine. That's fine. \n\nI can't leave the house. And a lot of his plan for me hinges on me being able to leave the house and do things that I can't, because of my OCD. \n\nI very badly need to see the GP because my health is terrible because of this situation, and I have other health issues, and I can't. \n\nI told him that I think SPS are being negligent and he said that's out of the CMHTs remit—fair enough. \n\nSPS have put me forward eating disorder treatment because of a false narrative that my first and only OCD treatment stopped because of my disordered eating and that I went to the ward because of my disordered eating, which is not true. I went into hospital for self-neglect, one of which was poor eating and drinking, which resulted in health issues. I was eating poorly *because* of my OCD. \n\nI understand disordered eating is prioritised but what sense does it make if it's being caused by my OCD? I'm not eating because I won't touch food due to contamination fears. The disordered eating service aren't going to be able to help with that. \n\nI also don't shower, don't wash my face, rarely brush my teeth. I don't understand how the supposed disordered eating could be a priority when the rest of my health is in such decline. \n\nAm I supposed to go to eating disorder therapy unwashed and in dirty clothes? Do they have experience of dealing with self-neglect? My life is so far removed from normalcy because of my OCD, nothing in eating disorder treatment is going to stick.\n\nThe entire reason why I'm in this situation was that the OCD team were worried my eating would decline once treatment began yet I've been barely eating and drinking because of my OCD and seriously ill as a result, and it just doesn't matter as long I don't die? I don't understand how this makes sense. I can lose teeth, get skin infections, kidney issues etc. but missing a meal is the end of the world? When I already don't eat. \n\nAnd the psychiatrist kept reiterating that I need to eat in spite of the contamination fears and if I could do that I wouldn't have OCD at all. \n\nI'm genuinely in despair. I'm in the exact same situation from last year which I still have trauma from, so I'm having to relive it through both memory and experience and it's fucking awful. \n\nI don't even want to work with the OCD team at this point because I genuinely can't believe that they would allow this to happen and if I had been working with them from since I chose to have OCD therapy back in MAY I may not have been in this situation. \n\nThe Community Nurse in charge of my care with SPS is insidious because I've been telling her everything that's been happening—the eating disorder team too who are quite lovely, because I've been promising that I'll get weighed at the GP since July—and she just doesn't care. She just keeps asking me how I'm going to manage with OCD treatment and using leading questions and comments to pressure me into going forward with the eating disorder stuff. I have OCD, I'm always going to choose what makes me feel the most comfortable so if you keep telling me that OCD treatment is really horrible it's obvious what's going to happen. \n\nI'm alone every day in this hell, I have no friends, nothing good to look forward to—my life is complete dogshit outside of this situation and this is just tipping me over the edge. \n\nI can't be arsed with this situation anymore. \n",

    "selftext": "I shared this elsewhere and wanted to post here too to get your thoughts from a UK perspective - my home country where these experiences occurred. Thanks for your time.\n\nWhen I was a student I started seeing a therapist who I valued and thought was great. He helped me turn aspects of my life around, be more confident and assertive and believe in myself in a way that I hadn't before. I really looked up to him like a father figure, especially as I have mixed feelings about my own father.\n\nI kept in touch with him and would go back to him for advice from time to time. Things changed a number of years ago when I was going through a rough patch - my work was unfulfilling and unrelenting, my long term relationship had disintegrated and a member of my family who I was close to fell seriously ill.\n\nMy therapist did spend some time talking to me about these things but it seemed to me his heart wasn't in it. I called him up one day and said to him directly that I was feeling like I was coming down with depression and I needed his help. All these years later I am still having trouble moving on from what he said to me: \"you are not depressed, in fact it's a bit pathetic\". I tried to insist that I really needed help and he said that I did not.\n\nI did not take this very well and had a full on breakdown (this was a catalyst but initial factors are the ones I mentioned before). I was not able to work for a number of months. I went to see a psychiatrist who said I had a severe case of clinical depression and asked why I hadn't done something about it before. At that time I was too embarrassed to tell him that I had tried and what had happened with that.\n\nHe prescribed medication and therapy. So I went to see a new therapist who was really knowledgable and professional - I did not connect with him like I had with my first therapist, but from an objective standpoint he was good. I felt close to KMS but I promised I would give it another try - although I knew it would be hard given what I'd already experienced.\n\nI really engaged with therapy, took the medication (even though I wasn't sure it was right for me, I decided to choose trust). The psychiatrist and therapist both thought I had a good prognosis and within a few months I felt a lot better and optimistic about the future. I felt like I'd really learned something and made progress. On advice of the psychiatrist I was able to taper down the medication. That might have been a mistake as I fell back into deep depression again, and due to my previous experiences, I was primed to believe that it had all been a lie.\n\nI know that's an exaggeration and the new therapist and psychiatrist were good professional people trying their best with something that is not an exact science and had managed to help me already, but I felt like I'd run out of any ability to trust the process.\n\nI did go back to therapy and start taking medication again but since then all I have been able to do is tread water (in fact I am taking more medicine now showing that I have actually got worse since I started the whole thing and not better). I have very little belief that I can get better which obviously holds me back and waters down any placebo effect. I also felt a lot of shame that not only had I mismanaged my life such that I was no longer able to function as an adult and had to be looked after by my parents in my thirties, I had then gone through a process where I had got somewhat better, told everybody I had learned something and was moving on, and then embarrassed myself again by showing that I had actually not learned anything or made any material improvements despite months of focused work.\n\nI have continued therapy for a long time out of a sense of resignation and duty but my heart has not been in it. I also have a new therapist because I moved for a job after eventually going back to work, but that has not helped me generate any belief or self-confidence in my ability to get better.\n\nI don't think there's a way for me to get better without therapy, but at the same time I have been stuck in the same pattern for a number of years now with no progress.\n\nI retain a deep sense of distrust that I might form some kind of (therapeutic) bond with my therapist and then get dumped by them, as well as shame that I am not able to manage an adult life despite all the help I've had. I have also alienated friends and found it hard to make new ones as I cannot fully show up when in the back of my mind I hear my mentor calling me pathetic (how can someone pathetic add enough value in a relationship?).\n\nCan anybody give any perspective on this and any suggestions as to how to approach this with a 'new mind' and turn things around for myself? I do believe that the right therapy can work in the right circumstances and don't want to fall down into a state of completely dismissing it all. I also considered posting this in [](https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/) for this reason, but when I read through the posts here I thought you would be able to better identify with these experiences and (I hope) give some more empathetic advice.

And the private place (Patient UK) that was suggested isn't taking anyone unless they come through CMHT but I have no idea how to do that. \n\nI guess the answer is going to be suck it up and deal, like I've been doing all my life, but it's just discouraging that I finally managed to do something proactive and it seems like it will be pointless after all. My symptoms aren't crippling or anything so I guess it's not the end of the world.",

    "selftext": "Hi all, On the 5th of August I started taking Sertraline on a 50mg dose. I didn't feel any side effects in the first couple of weeks. Suddenly on the third week I experienced eye floaters, then on the fourth week I started to experience really intense headaches. Stupidly, without powering through. I got anxious and scared and went cold turkey for 3 days and then felt worse so decided to bring them back to my system on a 25mg basis.\nOn the sixth week I went to see my doctor and spoke to her about my headaches and wanting to change my medications because I was experiencing such bad side effects. After reassuring me persistently that it wasn't anything serious (Brain Tumour, MS). She decided to put me on 10mg of Citalopram/Celexa. I'm on my 9th day and supposed to be moving up to 20mg after 5 more days but l'm experiencing the following side effects:\n\nHeadaches around temple, back of neck, below ear lobes and around my eyes Red eyes Eye floaters Muscle tremors Neck, back and shoulder pain\n\nAre these normal side effects? I have seen many people speak about these side effects on SSRI's. I suffer from a great deal of health anxiety so anything would be great. I really want to stick with these but I just need faith that these are normal side effects?",

    "selftext": "We've had an influx of modmails asking why certain submissions don't show up straight after posting.\n\nReddit's site-wide automoderator filters certain posts and places them into the moderation queue for manual approval. Automod does this for a bunch of reasons, including low karma, new accounts, keywords, possible spam/doxxing, etc.\n\nIf your post doesn't show up and you haven't deleted it, it's **in the mod queue.** This basically means that the mods just have to glance at it and either approve or remove. We're pretty much online and checking the queue all day, but **please** bear in mind we are also humans and it might take some time to review filtered submissions. We try and get to them as quick as we can. Please don't repeatedly post in quick succession if your post was filtered, automod will likely catch it for the same reason and it'll take us longer to review multiple or duplicate posts.\n\nIf your submission doesn't appear immediately, **it does not mean it has been deleted.** Please don't delete your post and then modmail to ask why it was removed, because deleting it will remove these details from the mod log and we won't be able to tell you. Leave the post up and we can check the exact reason.\n\nWhen you post, regardless of it gets filtered or not, you should receive a message in your inbox letting you know that some submissions do get caught by automod, especially if you are a new account or have low karma. **Before modmailing, please read this message and check the linked** [**sub rules FAQ**](https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthUK/comments/1f77gs8/sub_rules_faq/) **to see if that explains why your post hasn't shown up yet or if it breaks the sub rules.**\n\nIf your question isn't answered in the FAQ, it has been several hours since your post was made and it hasn't been actioned, or you have any clarifying questions, drop us a modmail. Please don't make posts about moderation / your posts not showing up, instead send these via modmail. This is the quickest way to get in touch and it avoids spamming the sub with technical Qs which would be removed anyway. However we do ask for your patience because it can take time for one of us to get to your modmail. Again, we try and do this as quick as possible, but inevitably it might take a while.\n\nThank you all for your understanding and patience!",

It can be for you, or for someone you know. If you have a specific request - ie, for kids, for a guy who doesn't really want pastel letter beads or pink hearts - you can specify that, and it's fine. I'm making them all up individually, so I can tailor. \n\nSome previous smaller ones [looked like this](https://i.imgur.com/fKEGefB.jpg) when I had bags for them, but these ones should come in wee boxes as I've just got some in specially.\n\nI've been doing these for a year and a half or something now, and there are certain times people might need to know they're available.

It’s easy to do, but also something with an end result. There’s enough beads and suchlike in them to make a bunch of necklaces, bracelets or whatever, and it’s something you can be proud of making for yourself, as gifts or...well, for anyone. Or just break them down and make more. There’s plenty of elastic.\n\nIt’s something very basic, but it’s time consuming, relaxing, easy to do and has a viable end result. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n___________\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo yeah. Drop me a line if you fancy one, and I’ll sort it. Please let me know if it’s for someone with issues with their fingers / fine motor control, as I can accommodate with larger beads. I can also add in little personalised messages if you want to send one to a friend. \n\nBe groovy and stay safe\n\n&nbsp;\n\n___________\n\n&nbsp;\n\n^^1 ^(Four currently, as the new boxes are a big smaller in size unfortunately and I can't fit too much more in.

I called 999 while this was happening seriously fearing our safety. I feel bad that we had to get the police involved but he said he was going to keep coming for us until he ‘got’ us. This escalated because mental health services didn’t take his mother seriously when she told them what he was saying to himself and how bad his schizophrenic episodes were. \n\nHe has now been arrested because they couldn’t find him a place in an inpatient facility and he was a danger to his family, and to us.

There is also a [benefits calculator](https://benefits-calculator-2.turn2us.org.uk/survey/1/c141440a-1c4f-471d-a4f0-3f4b1409c912) which may help you more accurately figure out what you're entitled to. \n\n* You can take the PIP self test [here](https://www.benefitsandwork.co.uk/pip-test) to see if you may be eligible for PIP. \n\n* You can view the eligibility criteria for PIP [here](https://www.turn2us.org.uk/Benefit-guides/Personal-Independence-Payment-Test/What-is-the-PIP-test). \n\n\n* For those **in Scotland**, Adult Disability Payment is the new replacement benefit for PIP which you can find more about [here](https://www.mygov.scot/adult-disability-payment)\n\n\n\n**Note: PIP can initially look like it is just for physical illness, but if you can prove that 'You can’t travel to a place you know without someone else, a guide dog or a special aid to help you' then you could get the 12 points that is required for enhanced mobility which is one way mental health illness could make you eligible**. \n\n**This criteria is based on how these impact you 'more than half of the time' so do not claim any issues that do not impact you to this degree, or it could be considered [benefit fraud](https://www.sentencingcouncil.org.uk/outlines/benefit-fraud/)**. \n\n* You can find out how to claim PIP [here](https://www.turn2us.org.uk/Benefit-guides/Personal-Independence-Payment/How-do-I-claim-PIP).

    "selftext": "I had my weekly appointment with my CMHT psychiatrist today. As ever I was answering some typical questions about hallucination, mood, intrusive thoughts, meds, etc. She was writing it all down on her notepad as she nodded away...\n\nAt some point, I said \"... something something, lorazepam, something something, PIP, something something because he knew I spent 2 months in the loony bin...\" \n\nThen my psychiatrist suddenly choked with laughter, she tried to stop herself by caughing and grabbing her neck but I think it made the urge to laugh even worse. I had a wide grin by this point, what on earth just happened? Then she bent down under her desk, I could see her back shook, so she was still trying not to laugh. Amused, I let her be for a minute.\n\nThen she came up for air, hair all out of place. She took a deep breath and said slowly, \"hospital, you were in hospital.\"\n\nDeadpan I said \"where loonies go\". She went back under her desk pretending not to laugh.\n\nHonestly, I am so glad I could make her laugh today. Her job must be mentally draining especially with many patients not engaging with contacts.\n\n4 weeks ago, I went into her office in a state, completely mute from psychosis. I could only write short words on her note pad. I was so broke, I couldn't afford to buy my meds so I was without all 6 medications for 5 days. There and then she cancelled her 2 next appointments. Set me up with UC (mainly for the free prescriptions), called a few hospitals to beg if they could let me have 4 weeks worth of free medications. One pharmacy manager at a hospital in the next town agreed to dispense free meds for me. Delivery would be to the CMHT clinic at 8 pm, but clinic closed at 5 PM. So she agreed to stay behind at the clinic after closure to wait for my meds. She sent me home in a taxi that day. At 8:30 PM the same day she was at my doorstep with 1 week worth of meds (she kept the rest at her office) and made sure she saw me take my dose for that night.\n\nAll my psychiatrists have been wonderful, but she went above and beyond. Wiith its flaws and limitations, and I am very grateful to the NHS. Yes I was locked up in hospital against my will, but through this difficult journey, I know every one wish me well. Seeing one of my psychiatrists laugh made me very happy.",

    "title": "The UK mental health system is an underfunded disaster",
    "selftext": "I’m so tired of being thrown around in the washing machine that is attempting to get mental health assistance in this country.\n\nA couple of weeks ago I had an appointment with a psychiatrist who did a really rushed assessment of me. I had been referred by my therapist with a suggestion of CPTSD (also on the NHS) and he also had notes from a private psychiatrist I’d seen regarding an ADHD diagnosis. He raced through the assessment and even apologised for this explaining that he had to question me in a rapid fire fashion as we didn’t have much time. \n\nAnyway - he then said he’s going to put me on a new antidepressant (lowest dose) for 2 weeks to monitor side effects and then I’ll come back for a follow up where he’ll start me on ADHD medication too. It had taken me literally years to get to this point so I was excited. So I started the antidepressants and now it’s 2 weeks later. \n\nWhen I had my initial appointment I received 2 letters from them with 2 different dates 2 weeks apart. I assumed this later date was the follow up appointment, it made sense since he said he wanted to follow up with the antidepressants. \n\nI booked the afternoon off from work and travel to the clinic for an appointment at 2:30. At 2:10 (whilst on the bus) I get a call from them. They ask if I remember that I was given a letter for an appointment and I of course say yes I know about that - to which they inform me it isn’t needed as my follow up will be in 3 months. \n\nI’m SO CONFUSED. So am I just stuck on this lowest dose of antidepressants for 3 months before a follow up then? He told me it would be 2 weeks that we’d catch up again. Why did they book in two appointments in the first place? Why did they only tell me 20 fucking minutes before it was scheduled!!?\n\nThis was almost 3 years in the making waiting for referrals to bounce around and sitting in months of waiting lists only to be put on 15mg of antidepressant and told to wait 3 months more. This is the latest in an endless series of frustrating hurdles and let-downs. I’m having to do so much work chasing things up and managing all of these appointments only to get nowhere. I just feel like I’m going in circles.\n\nHow is anybody meant to get help in this system. \n\nTl:DR - I keep getting sent in circles, left with unclear steps of how to progress and I’m generally feeling frustrated after years of not really getting anywhere.",

    "selftext": " I am not happy that I have been messed around so much when trying to get help from the NHS for my mental health. I understand they are facing unprecedented volumes of people with mental health issues, but that is never going to improve if their standard and quality of care also do not. It just seems that unless someone has a basic condition, it's game over. I have always shown a willingness to get better, I have been trying to work on things and get help, and sadly most of the time I have only been able to rely on myself, and getting help by doing my own research; but now when I felt I needed some professional help urgently, I have ended up worse off because of the fact I now feel totally dismissed and as if I have hit the end of the line. \n\nI think it is such an illusion that people are advised to see their GP's, or talk to people when they are feeling low, because you just get referred to another service who either close your case completely or they say your issues are too complicated, and refer you back to the GP. And the cycle starts again. I think so many people think this system is efficient, and it probably is for things like basic anxiety or depression, and some people obviously do manage to get the help they need. But certain people like myself slip through the net and are not offered any adequate care. So how can places like Central access point have the audacity to tell me I can call them to talk if I am ever feeling low. I will always feel low while fighting this battle that almost no professional would even have the patience to understand. \n\nAnd I find out for myself what has helped other people, through researching psychology articles, and books on dissociative disorders and depersonalization. But it's all useless, because my GP or anywhere they refer me to won't listen because they obviously do not know enough about the fact I cannot speak to any professional about this that understands it or can help. \n\nThis complaint was a shot in the dark for me to hold on to a hope I could try something again that might give me something hopeful. It is easier for them to shut me down when I am asking for help, than for them to be more aware of these disorders and other mental health disorders that span beyond the more common spectrum of just anxiety or depression. \n\nI understand that they are busy and just need to get through every complaint, and I'm sure it is easy to desensitize and see these complaints not as people but just statistics. But I want to live and get better, and by dismissing my calls for help, I have nothing left to hope for.\n\nI was diagnosed with Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder in 2017, after the onset being November 2016. \n\nAnd regarding the request to try LOW DOSE Naltrexone for dissociative disorder; It says Dr (Hidden) is not aware of anyone in the trust treating depersonalisation disorder with Naltrexone and there are currently no plans to do so. I dare say that he is not aware of this because nobody in the trust even knows what the disorder is or they have probably never heard of it, so I do not doubt that there are no plans to treat it. Sadly this comes at no surprise to me.\n\nI would like someone to address my complaint that can prove that they have some background in working with dissociative disorders. I deserve an explanation and reasoning for these decisions from someone who has studied and worked with people with a dissociative disorder, and not just a general psychiatrist or doctor who probably had to google about it before responding to my complaint \n\nI just find it shocking that there is still a huge gray area for certain complex mental health disorders, where if the public fall in to, they just get passed around between services, further adding to their stress and despondency, until they finally get the energy to make a complaint, but it seems that the complaints just check all the right boxes have been ticked, and make sure the right protocol has been followed, and then it is a successful job. But I do not think I could go to sleep at night after dismissing complaints and not doing something to make a change and helping people in these gray areas that are left with nothing.\n\nIf seeing a GP, calling helplines, going to every referral the GP’s recommend, if all of this adds to further distress and no change;\n\nAt what point will these suffering people like myself come to learn that if doing things the right way isn’t enough? What else must they resort to just to be noticed and end how they are feeling?",

    "title": "Being Trans in the UK: A Horror Story",
    "selftext": "Hi all. Can't sleep tonight, due to more stuff my GP won't help me get diagnosed, so I decided to just get some shit off my chest.\n\nI'm trans, I came out in April of 2018 to my girlfriend, after being with her made me realise that I didn't just like girls, I wanted to be one. I was 17 at the time. That makes me 23 as of writing this.\n\nWithin a couple months time I decided to start fully transitioning, starting with coming out to everyone, both at college and in the family. Mum was okay with it, but dad was pretty furious. I remember I posted something to my Facebook at the time, which he responded to with an angry react. He couldn't believe that I wouldn't discuss it in private with him first, more concerned about how he'd explain it to his workmates than how I'd explain it to... everyone I'd ever met.\n\nI was majorly depressed at the time, on and off antidepressants, self harming, had the police show up once to stop me from going any further than laying on the floor and... thinking about life. My parents and I didn't get along at all, and I think coming out as trans was the straw that broke the camel's back.\n\nI was kicked out not long after my 18th birthday. Luckily a school friend let me crash at their place for a few months, on a sofa in their basement essentially. I was supposed to be finishing my A-levels at the time, but I lost so much hope, I gave up on life. I didn't even attend one of my exams. Lost my job too, just laid in bed and couldn't find a reason to get up.\n\nSomehow, I managed to find myself in university, where a steady income and the freedom to express myself let me reclaim some of my life. I didn't attend classes, and failed my first year twice, but somehow, it ended up being a positive experience.\n\nSince then, I've been trying to find any jobs I can. Usually part-time, temporary contract work that's low skill and low pay. It's not the life I dreamt of as a kid, and I'm not happy. It truly feels like I haven't grown one bit since I left school. \n\nYou might notice that a lot of this doesn't really involve the fact that I'm trans. Truthfully, I neglect to talk about a lot of the misgendering and stuff because I can look past it: these people don't know any better, and I can forgive them when they correct themselves. \n\nBut what I neglected to tell you was that I actually signed up with The Laurels in Exeter, a specialised Gender Identity Clinic, not long after I first came out in 2018. And here we are in 2024, six whole years later, and I have not been seen by them a single time. Matter of fact, they're not even seeing new patients right now. The last people to be seen by them signed up in 2016. The only contact I've even got from them was earlier this year, to check if I even still want to be on the wait list, which I unfortunately do. Better than going to the back of a different clinic's queue.\n\nAll of the suicidal thoughts, anxiety, panic attacks, the societal pressure put on me to mature at a pace I'm not ready for, have been exacerbated, just by knowing at the back of my head that I'm on a waiting list for life-saving medical attention that I may never see, and that every day that they don't see me, my problems get worse, and harder to fix.\n\nI'm sure a lot of you know how difficult it is to jump through the hoops of the NHS system, to get yourself the help you deserve. I'm struggling on my own. My hormones have altered my body in a way that could possibly have been prevented 6 years ago, that will now take even more years of personal growth and fighting the system designed to help us to revert. I'm lucky to have even got myself on HRT, despite it being a low dose with no T blockers, and even more dangerously my GP refuses to do my blood tests regularly.\n\nThe UK isn't making it any easier either, as it seems with every day, my identity seems to be framed as some form of political topic, as opposed to just me trying to be my honest self. Others like me now have no access to puberty blockers because of these movements. Certain famous children's novelists rally up hatred for us. The UK is not a hospitable place for my kind. This world hardly is, at the moment.\n\nDepression is already hard enough to deal with on its own. Why does shit have to be this hard?",

I'm not bad enough for secondary care because the symptoms from my childhood trauma, abandonment issues and emotional neglect from spending a large portion of my childhood growing up in an institution without caregivers around, don't nicely fit the ICD-10 categories. This despite the fact that has impacted my entire life for decades, from cycling through major depressive periods to the point of suicidal and barely ok, to extreme anxiety about going places, struggling with relationships, getting overwhelmed easily and dissociating...I could go on but right now I feel like I've been barely living for years and years. I feel like I'm suffering doubly because the way I learnt to survive was to just shut the fuck up, just because I'm not acting out in public in a million possible ways doesn't mean I'm not feeling the same level of suffering in my head. From my trauma I've learnt to lie so we'll and so effectively mask everything that even when I was suicidal my boss thought I was actually happy. \n\nEveryone loves to compare mental health to physical illnesses (I don't know how much I agree with that). Well if I broke my leg they would give it a bespoke fix it based on the type of injury it had, so why the fuck can't to they do that for mental health. I accept that things like emdr and trauma based therapy aren't going to help much when you can't remember the trauma (I can't remember any time arriving there or my first year, or what I felt like) but the answer to that shouldn't be ok well we aren't going to give you any further help except more rounds of CBT if you need it ( yes I feel very lucky I managed to get 20 sessions and had a great therapist, but this mode hasn't really been helpful). Why the fuck don't I get bespoke treatment for my issues?! More than one mental health professional has suggested that would be a long term weekly talking therapy. I know I'm not the only person suffering from this gap in services, you only need to look at Reddit. There must be so many people like me suffering, but I  feel are being totally forgotten and are falling through the cracks. I wonder how many of those people end up reaching crisis point or worse because they aren't being helped. There is so much focus in the trauma field on childhood abuse, things that happened. Even less on childhood neglect in its various forms where the caregivers were there. So little is said about when caregivers weren't present at all for some or all of the time, even here on Reddit. I find that strange given that many of the original studies on neglect were done by following children from orphanages who were starved of interactions with people.\n\nI feel like those of us struggling over a lifetime with the outfall from childhood abandonment and emotional neglect are forgotten and sidelined. I finally managed the courage to try to get help from the services I pay for, and to tell someone the worst of it (when I learnt to stay silent) and instead of being given the help I need I'm being traumatised all over again by being neglected by the one institution that is meant to help me. Fuck it all.",

    "selftext": "I saw a post on here the other day as to whether BPD/EUPD was overdiagnosed in the UK. Whilst I don't know where I stand on that specifically, I do think that giving a BPD (or indeed many other PDs) diagnosis without targeted therapeutic options is unhelpful. \n\nOn the one hand, it can feel like a relief or a lightbulb moment to get a diagnosis for a complex mh condition as it puts your traits into perspective. On the other hand, a diagnosis does not provide closure and I would wager that a diagnosis in the absence of adequate treatment means patients are left frustrated, stuck in a grey area, and unable to move forward with fluctuating symptoms they don't know how to control. Sometimes you also feel compelled to 'prove' to others you have your disorder to feel validated as you're not getting targeted support. \n\nFor instance, I've found that for people who do not meet the criteria for DBT or MBT (I was rejected from MBT), many BPD patients are given short term skills workshops on emotional distress tolerance. Great - but this barely scratches the surface of a complex personality disorder! In my case, I deal with paranoia, chronic self esteem and significant interpersonal problems. My emotional dysregulation and self-destructive behaviours are a result of these things and so longer term MBT would be hugely useful. \n\nAs with many MH problems in secondary care, the criteria differs (some people may not necessarily present with as severe symptoms as others but their postcode determines access options). But a diagnosis is only ever one step.",

Apply to the council where you've been for the last 6 months, 3 out of the last 5 years, where you have close family, or where you work.

    "selftext": "There are several types of professionals in the mental health field / NHS services which all have different names - I work in the field but I imagine it can be confusing if you don't (its confusing if you do!). I thought it may be helpful to share a **very** brief explanation of the professions you may come across if you are in a NHS mental health service and what they may do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Clinical Psychologist** \\- Fully qualified Psychologist who tends to focus on 1:1 therapy, group therapies, leading/coordinating the psychology service. Referred to as 'Dr' as they completed 3 year doctoral training to become qualified but they are not medically trained therefore they cannot diagnose.\n\n**Counselling Psychologist -** Very similar to Clinical Psychologist but training was slightly different. Still completed 3 year doctoral level training however tend to be more focussed on person-centred therapy whilst clinical psychologists may focus on service development. In practice the roles tend to be interchangeable.\n\n**Health Psychologist -** Supporting healthier lifestyles and people to deal with the psychological impact of health and illness. Completed a 3 year doctoral level of training therefore is also referred to as a 'Dr' however is not medically trained.\n\n**Trainee Clinical/Counselling/Health Psychologist -** Currently completing their doctoral level training (in one of the areas above) so tend to be on 'placement' in a service for a limited period of time. Will be carrying out 1:1 therapy and is supervised by a qualified Psychologist (as above).\n\n**Assistant Psychologist -** Supervised by a fully qualified psychologist. Assistant's are not yet fully qualified as they have not done the doctoral level training however they will have completed an undergraduate or equivalent in psychology. May support with lower level 1:1 interventions, group sessions, assessments.\n\n**Psychiatrist -** Medically trained doctor who completed medical school. Psychiatrists can diagnosis. In the past psychiatrists carried out 1:1 therapy however nowadays in practice Psychiatrists focus on diagnosis, medication, assessments and care coordination (e.g., contributing to mental health act assessments).\n\n**Occupational Therapist -** Supports person's ability to fulfil their daily routines and roles. Helps people overcome difficulties caused by physical or mental illness, disability, accidents or ageing. Will have completed a degree in Occupational Therapy.\n\n**Mental Health Nurse -** Equivalent to a physical health nurse but their nursing training focussed on mental health. Tend to work in hospital or medical based services (inpatient, general hospitals etc).\n\n**Support Worker -** Provide day to day support with activities of daily living such as getting ready, eating, following medication, following care plans, general check-ins.\n\n**Support Time and Recovery Worker -** helps adults and young people with mental health problems or a learning disability. By offering practical support and advice. Focuses on a recovery model. Very similar to Support Worker.\n\n**Care Coordinator -** Manage and support you with your care plan. Will oversee your general care and how the care plan is implemented practically. Will regularly be in contact with you.\n\n**CBT Therapist -** Completed formal 1 year training in CBT. Will carry out 1:1 sessions of CBT only.\n\n**Trainee Psychological Wellbeing Practitioner -** 1 year training in IAPT. Will lead of 'guided self help' (CBT informed) sessions, groups/outreaches and assessments. Usually supervised by a CBT therapist. \n\n**Psychological Wellbeing Practitioner -** Completed the 1 year training and will continue with the above but also carrying out 1:1 CBT informed sessions with clients. Usually supervised by a CBT therapist. \n\n**Peer Support Worker -** An individual who is an expert by experience i.e., they have experienced the mental health difficulty or been very close to someone who has, for the service they are working in.\n\n**Art Therapist -** 1:1 therapy through the use of creative tools / art.\n\n**Psychotherapist -**  help adults tackle problems such as behavioural issues, common challenges such as anxiety and depression or more complex or severe issues, such as psychosis or a personality disorder diagnosis. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n(Again this is very **brief** so of course many core aspects of these roles have not been mentioned).",

He yells down the phone, 'PLEASE?' \n\nI have a raging headache from being miserable, not sleeping, not eating, stress, everything induced from the fact I'm unmedicated and haven't been able to see my GP since the last December before COVID.

After several seconds of silence I just go 'please?' only for him to snort and go 'yeah, okay' before transferring me.\n\nOh, and the blood clinic hung up on me again. And now I'm too upset to call back because if I get that operator again I'll probably burst into tears and he'll yell at me again.\n\nI'm so sick of it.

I'll make peace with having no meds, no doctor to talk to, no support, constant chronic pain, a suspected cyst, but I want this blood test. I want this simple blood test I've tried months to get.\n\nBut I guess I'll never get it. I don't know what to do anymore.

I've been abused as a child and I have mental breakdowns often, space out involuntarily, find it difficult to do basic tasks and concentrate, wake up exhausted every day, struggle making friends, have difficult relationships with my family, get overwhelmingly self loathing to the point where it feels like there is this pressure in my head and it just feels physically painful to live with myself and get urges to self harm. I had an hour long breakdown recently where my brain just felt like it was completely shutting down and it was intensely painful to go through, afterwards I felt completely spaced out for a good while. Anything family related triggers me into crying like hell and feeling like I'm experiencing all the shit I went through as a child again or makes me grieve for the parent child relationship I never got to have and the good childhood I never got to have. \n\nIt's exhausting it's overwhelming it's so fucking hard to function yet mental health professionals will look at that and go yeah entry level CBT is gonna work out for you, you don't need to access further levels of support. I went to the GP to ask for help explicitly for something longer term and dealing with something less entry level (no hate to people with milder-moderate symptoms or to these kinds of treatments, they're helpful but for me they just don't really provide a solution to the wider picture problems I have and it feels very surface level idk) and it felt like he was reluctant to offer anything longer term despite me expressing that I had tried other options and they don't work for me. I have another appointment to follow but I don't see it going well (perhaps someone can offer me some advice on how to argue further that I need something longer term pls? I really am so exhausted I've been feeling this way for almost 6 years I cannot deal with feeling this way anymore).\n\n It just feels like they ask if youre a suicide risk and if you're not it just feels like they don't care, or they just shove you into whatever path is easiest and quickest rather than what's most effective. I'm so tired. I was a suicide risk about 5 years ago and the only reason I didn't go through with it was to get out of my abusive situation and access proper help. I won't say I entirely regret staying alive because there have been positive developments in my life since that I am grateful for, however if 14 year old me knew that this is how I would be treated when I got out and tried to reach out for meaningful forms of help I'd have probably made a different decision. It's so frustrating and disheartening and most of all it makes 0 fucking sense. I should be able to receive help *before* I become a risk to myself so that I *don't* become a risk to myself.  I don't exactly want to lie and be rushed to a ward because it's both a shit move for me and I don't want to take up spaces of people who are genuinely at risk of suicide. I just wish my problems were taken just as seriously. The way I'm treated makes me doubt how I feel, it makes me feel invalidated and stupid for ever reaching out for help.",

    "selftext": " Hello,\n\nI  saw that an psychiatrist did an AMA the other week, and it seemed like  that was quite helpful and interesting for some of you to ask questions  and gain answers, so I decided to do an AMA about another profession -  AMHP.\n\nI currently work in England  in a community based mental health service. My professional background  is a social worker, but I have done additional training to become an  Approved Mental Health Professional (AMHP). For those who do not know,  an AMHP is a mental health professional (social worker, MH/LD nurse, OT  or psychologist) who has done additional training in the Mental Health  Act 1983, which gives them certain powers under the Mental Health Act.  One of the main powers, is the ability to make an application for  detention under the Mental Health Act (more commonly known as  'sectioning' someone). An AMHP is one of the main individuals involved  in arranging compulsory treatment in hospital. One common myth is that  it is the doctor who decides whether or not to section someone, when in  fact, for the main detention sections (s2, s3, s4) the doctors provide a  recommendation, but it is then up to the AMHP to decide whether or not  to admit them to hospital.\n\nIn  addition, I am a service user myself, and have been detained under the  Mental Health Act a number of times, so have experience on being on both  sides of the assessment.\n\nSo, feel  free to ask me anything about AMHPing, the Mental Health Act, being  sectioned, social work or anything else you can think of. I (obviously)  won't be giving any details about assessments I have been on to protect  patient's confidentiality, but can give general details about how  certain assessments work :) As I work full time, there may be a delay in my response, but will do my best to answer any questions in the evenings.",

    "selftext": "Bit embarrassed really, but could do with some advice or a talking to I guess. Basically after 14 months of working from home I’ve been called back into the office from Monday and am having a really hard time with the thought of it. \n\nLast week I thought I had 7 weeks, that word was the handful of us that weren’t back in yet would be made to when the UK guidance on distancing likely changes in June. Instead I got an email from the manager a week ago calling me in and broke down, I’ve been massively struggling ever since. \n\nLong story short I live with my elderly mum and have been so worried about her picking up covid I ended up signed off with anxiety for a fortnight last Feb/March and was only in the office a week or so before the original wfh order came in. She is vaccinated but I’m still so worried about these variants (to top it off half my town is now being surge tested for the South African one), and the fact that indoor dining, pubs etc all reopen the week I go back. \n\nThere’s no mask wearing in the office (we’re a call centre so on the phone constantly) as they’re relying on the 1m+ rule, no windows, and I’ll be sat right near the aircon. Work won’t budge on me being able to wfh again regardless of circumstances.\n\nThe other issue is me. I’m half vaccinated (2nd due start of June), but also morbidly obese and worried that will have affected how effective the vaccine has been (I’ve done a private antibody test which came back positive). Rather than buckle down and do something about my health over lockdown I’ve instead gone the other way and managed to pack on at least another 30lb since last March due to eating being the only way I really deal with depression. I’m disgusted with myself and already making excuses to not meet up with friends yet. The feeling of dread I have about walking into a room of 30 or more people I haven’t seen in over a year and don’t particularly like is sickening. \n\nWednesday I reached out and got a phone appointment with a doctor who prescribed me Mirtazapine (after a not great experience last year with Sertraline), I’ve taken 2 so far but know they not likely to kick in properly for a few weeks (the feeling of stoned bliss on night 1 was lovely, sadly didn’t hit me as hard last night).\n\nSorry for the essay. I know I’ve been incredibly fortunate to have been able to shield my mum and myself for most of this, but I feel so so overwhelmed. My mum is literally the only family I have (and only person in my life other than friends) and I’m so scared of being away from her now, then bringing something in, or something happening to her when I’m not there (she’s had a couple of choking episodes and near accidents I’ve been glad I’ve been around to help with this past year). \n\nI can’t stop worrying and crying, it’s all that’s on my mind 24/7. I don’t have any money behind me to just up and quit no matter how much I want to (plus I have to give 12 weeks notice as I’ve been there so long) but I am looking at other wfh jobs. Half of me just wants to get signed off until they sack me as it seems easier than dealing with this worry. For the record I’m 37, not the child this all makes me out to be. Lots of love to you all and thanks if you made it this far.",

    "selftext": "I've been trying to get help for roughly a decade now. When I was a teenager I was under Mind for a while and I got a few sessions from a couple of charities, but they couldn't fund enough sessions to make a difference. CAHMs refused to help me full stop. Maybe if they'd helped me then I wouldn't have become a completely non functional adult who can't even go outside. \n\nAs an adult I've made a couple of suicide attempts and have a long history of serious self harm. My GP has been constantly trying to refer me on to mental health services for years with no luck, and has even sent me straight to A&E on several occasions. The experience has always been the same, I wait 6 hours in a room, a mental health \"worker\" comes in, patronises me, asks me what's keeping me from killing myself, then hands me a leaflet with the samaritans number on it and sends me home. When I pointed out that that's what happens one visit, they MADE ME WRITE IT DOWN MYSELF instead. \n\nI've come *close* to receiving help exactly twice. The first time was immediately after my most recent attempt last year. I got given some medication, had about 2 weeks of daily phone calls, and was promised I would be assessed. Then all contact was cut, my GP wasn't even notified about the medication, and I never heard anything again. The second is what has just happened.\n\nI self referred to IAPT as a last resort. I thought I was actually getting help because they called back almost immediately after my initial assessment to tell me that my case was too \"complicated\" for IAPT but they referred me to the secondary care team, who assessed me in person. They spoke to me about talking therapy and other help, gave me medication, and promised me that they would call back in two weeks when my medication ran out. Well, here's a surprise for you: they didn't. In fact, once again, my GP didn't even know I'd been given medication. Fuck, they didn't even know I'd been assessed or been in contact with mental health services. So after a 6 hour telephone wild goose chase (mostly done by a family member while I had a huge breakdown) I finally got my medication- a month's worth, at a lower dose than I was taking, with no further instruction.\n\nI'd like to add that I was desperate enough to confide in them that I had a plan to end my own life and am currently in possession of the means to do so. They also know that that is still the case. So I'm going to go ahead and assume that they don't give a flying fuck what happens to me and even trying to get help in the first place was a stupid idea. I certainly won't be trying it again.",

On my second visit I was told CMHT discharged me without my knowledge or my GP's knowledge because they didn't think I needed help. The GP put a request for an emergency referral back to them within 48 hours, yet they still took 3 weeks to get an appointment.

I was told they would have all of my notes. I went to this appointment yesterday and the woman had none of my notes from my previous assessment, none of my GP's notes or from the psychiatric liaison at A&E so I had to repeat everything. I was then told I'd have to wait 3 months to be referred to secondary care. I said that if they didn't discharge me in the first place I could have already had some support. I haven't been given any support while I wait for this next appointment or even medication. Every appointment with them makes me feel worse. Also, the appointment was at 10 o'clock and I wasn't seen till 15 minutes later, but at 11 she rushed me out because she had another appointment waiting even though i was crying and clearly distressed.

They proceeded to separate us and it felt like I was being interrogated. I could hear in the other room it sounded like they were antagonising my partner (one officer told him he was \"being childish\" and he'd \"clearly  had a skinful\") and based on the questions I was asked it seemed they were treating it like a domestic issue instead of someone having a mental health crisis, I'm guessing because I mentioned we'd had an argument earlier in the night on the 999 call.\n\nThe whole experience was terrifying and horrible, and it felt like I was  accusing him of something rather than just trying to get him help.

    "selftext": "\nHi.\n\nI’ve finally been discharged from the psych ward and thought that I might aswell share my experience.\n\nThe reason I was admitted was because I have been suffering with depression and anxiety for over four years and eventually attempted to take my own life.\n\nOn my admission date, four different staff members had to search me and my luggage. \n\nAll patients had their own ensuite. \n\nWe had anti-suffocation bedding, anti-ligature curtains, windows that would only open a few inches, TV’s locked in by screws, plastic mirrors, ‘emergency call’ buttons in every bedroom and everything was sloped. \n\nThe ward that I was admitted to had a daily schedule that would be encouraged for us to follow.\n\nAt 08:00, staff members wake us up. \nThey would open the windows, take our bedsheets, take away person items and ward privileges… do anything to get us out of bed. \n\nOnce we have woken up, we’re encouraged to take a shower, but not many of us actually manage to do so.\n\nWe have time until 09:00 to have breakfast, if we miss the deadline, we have to wait until 10:30 for snacks. \n\nAt 09:00, we have education. \nMost of us just sit and do whatever we feel like, there wasn’t much pressure to actually complete work.\n\nAt 10:30, we have snacks. \nIf we miss snack-time, we would have to wait for lunch at 12:00.\n\nAt 11:00, we go back to education, until lunch-time.\n\nAt 12:00, we have our lunch. \nIf we miss lunch, we need to wait for snacks at 16:00.\n\nFrom 13:00 to 16:00, we have group activities and therapy sessions that vary throughout the week.\n\nAt 16:00, we have snacks. \nIf we miss snack-time, we wait until dinner at 18:00.\n\nAfter 16:00, we’re allowed to ask for our electronic devices that are kept in a locked room by staff or we can just have ‘free-time’ and hang out with the other patients.\n\nAt 18:00, we have dinner. \nIf we miss dinner, we wait for snack-time at 20:30.\n\nAfter dinner, we can continue with our ‘free-time’.\n\nAt 20:30, we have our last snack-time of the day.\nIf we miss snacks, we have to wait for the next morning to have  breakfast.\n\nAfter 20:30, our ‘free-time’ continues, until our bedtime, which depends on our age.\nThe latest bedtime we had was until 23:00.\n\nOn specific days, we would have time to do our laundry and change our bedding.\n\nAnd that’s pretty much the whole week summed up.\n\nIt definitely wasn’t the best experience, but I honestly believe that I have benefited from it.\n\nThe positives are:\n-creates a daily structure and routine for productivity.\n-working on your mental-health.\n-making friends that relate to you.\n\n\n\nThe negatives are: \n-seeing and hearing other patients having incidents and those incidents triggering yourself.\n-the staff are quite unreliable.\n-depending on the type of patients, they may say hurtful things to you and others around them or even try to physically harm you.   \n\n\nFeel free to ask me any questions.\n\nHope this helped.\n\n:)",

We decided that we really needed a new one as it was taking me nearly 45 minutes to cook one sliver of salmon.\n\nMeasured and measured again just to be sure - I have a habit of getting measurements wrong!  Phoned the shop and discovered that yes they had that very model which they could install for us!  Came off the phone feeling very proud of myself.  I find it so difficult to hold a conversation on the phone due to my anxiety.\n\nEmptied the old oven out this morning and even cleared a path through all of the \"charity shop\" stuff in the hallway which is still awaiting dispatch from Finch and Co.\n\nTwo very large, sturdy chaps turned up - complete with masks.  \"Oh\", said one, \"We may have a problem here\".\n\nTurns out that the Isolation switch for our oven is......right above the oven which apparently a no no.\n\n\"Well where is it supposed to be?\" I ask.  \n\"Just to the left of the oven\"  \n\"What???? Why\"  \n\"Well in case the oven goes up in flames you can turn the switch off safely to the side rather than burning your hands\".  \n\"You have got to be joking\" I said.\n\nIt was at this time that mum decided to join us from the living room where Poppy was barking to all and sundry that we had visitors.\n\nShe appeared with her mask on upside down.  \n\"What's going on?\"  \n\"They can't install the bloody oven because that switch is in the wrong place!\"  \n\"Why\"\n\nPoor chap goes through it all again saying that he could end up serving life for manslaughter if he plugs in our new oven here.\n\n\"Oh balls!\" I said  \n\"Kristen, language\" Mum said.  \n\"I don't give a shit\" I said.  Could see the other bloke trying not to laugh.  \n\"You musn't swear in front of people.\"  \nI asked the guys if they were Mormans and they said no.  \n\"They're fine mum they are blokes!\"\n\nMum then chooses this moment to have one of her coughing fits - which is not a covid thing just something that whooping cough left her with.  \n\nMen look nervous.\n\nIn the end they had to take the lovely new oven away without installing it.\n\n\"Right\" I say, \"Better ring a electrician.\n\nExplain over phone that we need our switch moved and book a date.\n\nOriginal store we were dealing with now rings and says that they can come back next week and install it with a special bloke who has the authority to plug the bloody oven in.\n\nRing other guy to cancel moving switch.\n\nThis is why I hate talking to people.

My room was messy because I was being plagued by intrusive thoughts and didn’t have the concentration to tidy it. One support worker mocked me when I said I was struggling with my ocd. (This support worker later assaulted me) ‘you don’t have ocd, your room is a mess’ proceeded to laugh and gossip with her support worker buddies. This was my first time in a mental hospital and before going in I was told that the people there would be trained and understand mental health. Guess not\n\nI was 19 and was under the ‘care’ of the crisis team for the first time. I was having an anxiety attack/meltdown because I was triggered by something that sparked my paranoia (I’m on the spectrum) My mum was talking to the crisis team on speaker so I could hear everything. They literally told her: ‘she’s just throwing a tantrum, like a child would’ my mum tried explaining I was genuinely struggling and they told her to just not engage. First of many awful interactions i had with the crisis service.\n\nA couple years ago I was in and out of inpatient due to suicide attempts. A guy from the crisis service came to do a home visit. I explained why my mental health was making me suicidal and he just said that if I commit suicide it’s my decision and I should take responsibility for it. The whole point of suicide is so I dont have to deal with this shit anymore and dead people cant really take responsibility because they’re.. dead.\n\nThere’s so much more but I can to type them all out as it would take days.",

    "title": "An American's experience with the NHS",
    "selftext": "Some background. I'm a mid-30s male. I have dual UK and US citizenship and moved back to the UK about 5 years ago. \n\nWhilst in the US I served in the US Marine Corps. After the fact I suffered from PTSD and was treated by the VA (department of veteran's affairs). This provides free lifetime healthcare to veterans like myself, and it's like nothing else. \n\nFor a period of about 2 years, I had a fortnightly appointment with a Psychiatrist and saw a Psychologist twice a week. After you'd leave the Psychiatrist's office, by the time you got to the pharmacy at the lower level your new prescription was already bagged and waiting for you. Any test or anything that needed to be done was performed on demand. It was awesome. \n\nNot to mention hooking you up with an advisor that would be aware of your healthcare, help you find a career, skills, help you with your CV and find a job. 10/10 care, and it's to be expected when the US government effectively has unlimited money. \n\nI was diagnosed during this time with Bipolar 2. Within hours bloods were done and I started rotating medications before settling on lithium and lamatrogene. I don't have major Bipolar (if you can say that) and the meds pretty much fixed me. \n\nI moved to the UK and hoped to just get a repeat prescription. Cue skepticism, a need to evaluate me for themselves, but that will take a year and a half to wait for. No meds in the meantime. \n\nI stuck with it though. Eventually I was evaluated and given lithium. \n\nCue a constant cycle of needing a re-fill, but a blood test needs to be done first. You'll run out of meds in 10 days but we can't do a blood test for 20. Oh well, sucks to be you. \n\nFor about 2 years it went on like this. I'd be medicated but then have it interrupted by a delay in being able to perform a test, or some niggle within the truly byzantine bureaucracy of the NHS. This would trigger hypo-manic episodes where I'd act incredibly recklessly. Oh, the GP did a blood test last month? Well here at the mental health clinic we need to do our own. \n\nEventually I contacted my GP and asked to consider an alternative medication that wouldn't require blood tests. She stopped my treatment, and cue another 9 month unmedicated wait for a discussion about a new medication. \n\nFor one reason or another this kept being delayed, until I eventually cracked and decided to go private. The Doctor was great, and we talked at length about medication. However he needed a blood test. He requested one from me GP. 2 weeks later I got an appointment and the practitioner couldn't get blood and said they'd have to reschedule for in a month to try again. \n\nSo I called some regional office and was able to find one the next day on the other side of Manchester. Got said test done, the NHS nurse knew what she was doing and got blood immediately. Job sorted. \n\n4 weeks later, still no blood results. I call the GP, who says to call the clinic where I got the blood taken, who said I have to call the flobotomy? department where I got the blood taken as they were merely visiting the clinic, they said I had to call the local hospital who said I had to call the GP...... \n\nIt's ridiculous. This is the kind of thing that leads to people giving up and commiting the worst. I'm not for a moment expecting the amazing care I got from the US government, but I genuinely got better and more consistent care in Ecuador. The ability of the NHS to provide medication to me on a permanent basis falls woefully short.\n\nFor my own sanity and well-being, I'm moving back to the US shortly to resume treatment with the VA. I don't want to leave the UK, I love the people here, I love the constant history. However I can tell I will only get worse mentally should I remain. I find it unconscionable that the UK government takes hundreds of pounds from me each month to fund a service that can't even prescribe medication I've been on for years. Better I keep that money and get care privately. \n\n\nSorry, I realize this is a long rant with nothing productive to say other than, my heart goes out to anyone currently in the midst of this kafkaesque system that is NHS mental health services.",

    "selftext": "So I've been diagnosed with emotional dysregulation/EUPD among other things (OCD, PTSD, anxiety) and was given the standard 6 sessions of CBT after being discharged from CAMHS at 18. Since that didn't work I was referred to level 2 services/put on a waiting list for DBT. I'm 20 now and have been on the waiting list for over a year, I was working a part time job but I recently had a call with my care coordinator and let her know I just got a full time job, thinking she would be happy/proud of me. Nope, she was annoyed because it had already been hard to fit my monthly check ups around my job, but now I'll be working Mon-Fri 9-5 it's apparently impossible. \n\nThey don't offer any sessions outside of 9-5 Mon-Fri apparently. I ended up having a full breakdown on the phone basically asking \"So you don't treat people who have jobs?\" and she said \"Well most people make the time and effort for treatment\" which just made me even more annoyed \"You're saying that me having a job isn't making enough effort to get better mentally?\". She asked if I could ask my employer if I could have an hour off every week in the middle of the day for DBT sessions? No, my new job is in a preschool, I can't just take an hour off every single week in the middle of the day to sit on a group therapy call.\n\nI feel hopeless and I'm looking into the costs for private therapy, because she told me it's basically impossible to fit treatment around my (completely normal) work schedule. I don't understand it, they don't treat anyone that has a full time job? It's taken me almost 2 years, multiple nervous breakdowns, loads of different medications etc to get to the point where I feel stable enough to have a full time job, and looking forward to being able to get even better with DBT, and now I'm told that I'm on my own again. \n\nHas anyone else had this experience?\n\nTDLR; I got a full time job Mon-Fri 9-5 and the NHS have told me they don't offer treatment outside those hours, so getting a full time job has left me without any treatment options for my mental health.",

    "selftext": "Why is it that mental health practictioners, particularly the ones who work in A & E (I don't mean therapists or psychiatrists) really suck at their job. Its sometimes like they have come from incredibly privileged lives in which they haven't had to live through trauma like we have or feeling so different from the rest of society.\n\nAlso I understand some professionals are naturally coming from a objective view point, they ave to make judgements calls and can question your feelings and emotions as that's their job, and even ones that feel apathetic as they see soo many people but this one in particualr made me feel soo much worse, seemed unepathetic. Although the nurses were really nice and honestly do a better job at helping me than any A & E mental health profession I've talked to.\n\nCaution; mention of self harm and suicide\n\n\n\nSo yesterday I overdosed, instantly regretted it and took myself to A & E. I had my typical tests ext. But 11 hours I waited to talk to a member of the mental health team. This person was honestly a deplorable human being. She asked why I did it and the normal questions, I explained to her that I've been struggling with suicidal ideation, depression, my emptiness, self harm ext. my undiagnosed autism (I'm not a tiktoker self diagnoser, my twin has it and I know I also do as well for years)\n\nSo after telling her about my traumas which include domestic abuse, sexual assault, emotional abuse, dealing with a suicidal mother, neglect, bullying all the nine years at a very young age, this person decided to tell me that i couldn't be misrable or depressed because I regretted my overdose, I tried explaining that most people regret their attempts at suicide and I was scared, and that it wasn't the point my point was that I've been getting worse over the last year as I just attempted, she was like but you regretted it and argued I can't be in a bad state. She proceeded to tell me the reason I'm soo bloody misrable and empty and lonely (I explained these and said these feeling were getting more intense along side my self harm getting worse and losing my friends and the meaning in life) is because I choose to be, and that if I wanted to be happy and social ext. I would try to change that. I got angry and told her I've been trying to change that for 15 years, and that for me it seems to be a fundamental issue, and that's why I wanted therapy. She still argued with me. Then proceeded to tell me autism doesn't make life any harder, she tried saying that because they are happy and intelligent autistic people, like wtf? They're paraplegic athletes, doesn't mean its not harder for them to run. \n\nThe conversation kept going with 100 other examples and her telling me that we should just focus on support loans and university counselling, both I've done multiple times and I told her they haven't helped, so i said i dont want a support plan or safety plan, i already have one anyways with my previous counsellor that helped a little, she then went on to say okay it's your choice to decline the care and if you progress worse that's your fault, I tried explaining I'm not denying care as a whole I'm simply explaining what works and what doesn't, and that again I need trauma informed therapy or at least the chance to discuss options instead of being told for the 1000th time to try uni counselling which hasn't helped. She even said it's my fault for quitting talking g therapy, I explained i didn't and that my therapist let me go because she felt that talking therapies was no adequate and that I needed something more specialized.\n\nMore conversations about how autism isn't actually a disorder ext. And that I can't be that bad and getting worse, this person made me feel angry, dehumanised, not listened to and more suicidal. \n\nI asked if I could leave because it was making me feel worse and it was 5am and I was tired, she told me how I expect to get better if I deny their care, I explained I'm not denying care but I'm super tired and I have a telephone appointment with a mental health professional at 10am anyways, so I need to prioritize that as I've waited months for it as well as the fact that the \"care\" was making me feel worse and that the doctor said i could go home, she simply repeated herself multiple times.\n\nAfter I came out into the waiting area in tears, the people who were waiting with me were great and helped calm me down.",

    "title": "The Mental Health \"Crisis\" team seems misnamed",
    "selftext": "A while ago I phoned NHS 111 and was put through to the Mental Health Crisis team, this was about 10pm on a Sunday.\n\nI explained that I'd been having trouble with manic depression but had recently swung much much further into the 'manic' direction than ever before. I'd spend the last hour screaming the foulest obscenities and racial slurs at nobody, howling and screaming, slamming my fists against the walls, destroying furniture, literally ripping the clothes off my body like the incredible hulk, punching everything until my hands were bloody, running back and forth looking for things to smash like a wild beast. In short, completely overwhelmed with irrational rage.\n\nThe man offered to email his boss with the 'urgent' flag so he'd read it first thing in the morning and he'd call me to see if he could help. I said there seems to be some mistake, I thought this was the Mental Health CRISIS team not the Mental Health \"We'll-Get-Around-To-It-Probably\" team. Then he asked the most frustrating question that all NHS Mental Health staff absolutely love asking because there's no good answer. \"What do you *want* me to do?\"\n\nIt doesn't matter what I want, it only matters what you're actually able to do. If I said I wanted Freudian psychoanalysis or Jungian or any other type it doesn't matter because the NHS doesn't offer that, they only offer CBT which is about as much use as the NSFW definition of CBT.\n\nI said I wanted valium. I've seen it in movies, someone's very agitated, you prescribe them valium. Maybe not valium, maybe lithium, maybe some form of sedative. There are ways to manage mental health crises other than taking one SSRI per day and waiting a month to see if that helps. Then began the most frustrating exchange imaginable. I can't decide if he was deliberately antagonising me as a joke or it was his first day and he didn't know what to do other than follow the script:\n\nHim: \"I can't prescribe you valium\"\n\nMe: \"Ok, what else can you do to help me?\"\n\nHim: \"I can't prescribe you valium. Only your doctor could do that. I can't do that.\"\n\nMe: \"Yes, Ok, I get that. What else can you do to help me?\"\n\nHim: \"I can't prescribe you valium.\"\n\nMe: \"Yes, I know! You've said that. What ELSE can you do to help me?\"\n\nHim: \"I can't prescribe you valium.\"\n\nMe: \"Yes, moving on from that. Ignoring the valium, is there anything ELSE other than valium that you could do to help me?\"\n\nHim: \"I can't prescribe you valium.\"\n\nMe: \"Jesus Christ! Stop talking about valium. OK. I'm asking about something ELSE. Something that is NOT valium. I know you can't prescribe me valium. Can. You. Do. Any. Thing. ELSE! To. Help. Me?\"\n\nHim: \"Sir, please calm down. I'm trying to explain that I can't prescribe you valium.\"\n\nMe: \"STOP TALKING ABOUT FUCKING VALIUM!\"\n\nHim: \"Sir, you need to calm down. I cannot prescribe you valium.\"\n\nMe: \"For the love of christ, I'm begging you. Please. PLEASE. Listen to the words that are coming out of my mouth. Not valium. NOT VALIUM. Pretending I never said valium. Is there anything ELSE that is NOT valium that you can do to help me?\"\n\nHim: \"I can't prescribe you valium.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hung up and spent the next twenty minutes trying to contact his supervisor because I was convinced he was doing it deliberately to annoy me. It's like the drive-through scene in Dude, Where's My Car? where the woman keeps saying \"...and then...?\" to ask for more items in the order and the guy says. \"And then, then nothing, then we're done.

    "title": "Just A Rant About the NHS",
    "selftext": "Hi all. Doing this on my main account under my real name so I'm not going to post massive details, it's not really relevant anyway. Just writing out my experience with the mental health services in this country and I'm curious of how others have been treated in the past. I'm debating whether to write an open letter to the Government over it, but we'll see.\n\nSo a long story short, I was diagnosed with OCD a while back, around 2008. At the time I had been passed around so many different providers and counsellors who had absolutely no experience with OCD that I gave up seeking treatment and went cold turkey. It took me maybe four or five years to vaguely put myself back together, but I did eventually manage to live a somewhat normal life for about ten years. \n\nIn fairness I was lucky to get a diagnosis after a suicide attempt. Had I not got that diagnosis, I doubt I'd still be here.\n\nMedication has never been an option for me because I have severe reactions to all of the SSRI medications I've ever tried, so it was genuinely a case of gritting my teeth and getting on with it.\n\nFast forward to six months ago, i have suffered a major relapse and ive basically not functioned since. I've barely left the house beyond the local shop or picking kids up from school, and ive been desperate to find help because im so worried its going to take another 4-5 years from me. I've been suicidal and severely depressed, too.\n\nOver 15 years later, after so much bullshit on the news and from the government about how they're taking mental health seriously, I'm disappointed to say that things feel just as bad now as they ever were.\n\nI went to A&E numerous times basically begging for a psychiatrist but it gets nowhere. On one occasion even within a mental health ward within a hospital I've basically been laughed at when explaining what I've been going through (and was then told I was aggressive for getting angry about their unprofessional attitude.)\n\nI've phoned 111 numerous times and basically, if you're not physically in the process of tying a rope around your neck they don't want to know particularly. The suggestion that people should phone Samaritans doesn't really work for people who have complicated compulsions and fears that nobody else will really understand. \n\nThe GPs can't or won't help, I know it's down to me to force them to do a referral but I'm so exhausted for pushing all the time, plus I don't like making a fuss particularly.\n\nDue to personal circumstances I managed to get a CBT counsellor relatively quick but whilst it's no fault of the woman, she was not well read up on OCD and I knew the treatment she was providing was non-effective. That treatment was ended anyway after I missed one appointment (I genuienely couldnt face going out) and all I got was an generic automated email saying they've taken me off of the course. No phone call to even ask if I was OK or anything, I just think it's disgusting.\n\nI've not worked for six months now (well I have but I've basically been fired from two jobs in six months because I was too stressed to even turn up to a part time job) but I now realise the only hope I've got is through private treatment. So I've done an application for PIP hoping that might at least enable me to do a few appointments a month or something but i very much doubt that theyre going to approve my claim. \n\nThe system is so ridiculously unfair. The only time I've felt genuinely cared for by anyone in the system is when I phoned an NHS OCD specialist who rang me back and basically did an hours free phone call with me in her own time. I can get referred but realistically its going to be a year or more before getting anywhere.\n\nThe NHS system generally is a joke and doesn't have any care for individuals and the whole situation with private sessions just means that only people who are well enough to function and earn money can ever get the help they need. There's next to no financial assistance for people with mental health issues (PIP seems to be a sick joke that discriminates against mental health so far as I can tell so far) and for the first time in my life I can see why so many people DO end up either killing themselves or becoming homeless alcoholics.\n\nSorry for the rant. I'm just very overwhelmed with how inherently unfair the situation is and im sorry we all have to put up with it.\n\nEdit: BTW, does anyone else get pissed off with the number of online campaigners there are out there for mental health who all seem to want to help others, but they put up a £200 per hour price tag just for a conversation? Not even qualified therapists either. Got to admire the grift.",

Luckily, I was resourceful enough to delve into my own healing journey. \nI am now a housing officer working in supported accommodation with young people aged 16-25 year olds most of varying degrees of MH needs some more severe than others and nothing has changed. \nWhile supporting one young lady who was hearing voices, battled with suicidal thoughts & self harm, she described to a MH health nurse how the voices were telling her to hurt herself or others and due to this she never leaves her room, often beats herself to a pulp and is scared to let anyone around her, begging for help.. the nurse flippantly says. \n“Have you tried knitting?” As if it was funny. \n\nIt makes me wonder are these nurses burnt out, just rude or is this what they are trained to say? \nHas anyone else experienced this, or have any insight why MH “professionals” think this is ok? Cause I don’t think it’s professional or ok! ",

    "selftext": "As many of you maybe aware of, I was in a model similar to the serenity integrated monitoring, a model that was judged on effectiveness based on cost saved and not patient recovery. A model that has now been classified as negligence and malpractice by the NHS trust.\n\nMy situation was similar to what a lot of people under these models experience. Suicidal thoughts and behaviours with zero clinical help as they were worried it would reinforce the suicidal behaviour. They are literally trained not to provide help, answer calls or react in anyways when a patient is suicidal. Instead the police threaten you with criminal behaviour orders. If I was to ring the crisis team, they wouldn't care, if I was to ring another team for support the police would just tell me that my suicidal behaviour was classed as malicious communications. \n\nImagine being suicidal and it seems like no one cares at all, infact they just made it worse by threatening you with criminal prosecution, which as someone with depression and anxiety made my situation spiral out of control. As it was I was suicidal, and then no one would help me and the police would threaten me and try and coerce me into behaving a certain way. This just made my situation worse.\n\nThese kind of systems, as of last month, have now been classed as malpractice and negligence. So I guess that as a result the NHS trust acted negligently towards me, and just made my situation worse.\n\nYes the NHS probably saved money not having to provide support and help to people in need. But how much money has it cost our society in the long run not providing crisis support for those in need.\n\nFuck the NHS.\n\nThis is just my experience.",

    "selftext": "Im a total fuck up and I know it. After 30 years of feeling like this Im finding it extremely hard to find meaningful reasons to carry on.\n\nSome context - Im a single white male in his 40\\`s living in the uk. I cant say that I wasn't brought up in a loving family, because I was. I wasnt sexually abused by anyone, but I was bullied all the way thru my primary & secondary school years by a number of people and ignored by a lot others.  Apart from school .. Life as I knew it was ok.  I eventually went to college & have ended up working in about 25 different organizations due to my superpower of doing or saying something stupid or turning up late (due to no sleep) and getting sacked. I worked full time for approx 10-15 years but lately have only managed to get part time jobs. I now live on my own, I have a few friends but I hardly talk to anyone as I dont see the point anymore, I know this is not good but I sub-conscious brain doesnt care.\n\n.....\n\nIve just written 3 paragraphs and deleted them all as when I re-read it back .. its all over the place. I am finding it extremely hard to put my emotions down atm as my mind & vision is going bonkers and Im getting overwhelmed a lot,  I am just going to bullet point the issues that I have trouble with n hopefully u will get the picture of how much of a fuck up my life is and why I feel its pointless seeking medical help.\n\n1 - I never really go out unless I have to.  I dont know why I do this. I realize that its making me depressed.  I meet with friends when invited and go to work, but I never really do anything for myself.\n\n2 - I dont really wash or brush my teeth. I dont know why I act like this. It has been an issue from my early childhood, I used to put up reminders but ended up taking them down cos I look like a massive dickhead when ever someone comes into my flat as its embarrassing that I need notes to tell me to do things that \"normal\" people do automatically.  I look a right state & assume the only reason no one at work says anything due to the PC nature of us humans and not wanting to offend.\n\n3 - I have massive issues reading and writing & memory.  I dont know if im dyslexic as sometimes I can read totally fine? The issue that I seem to have is that it takes me a long time to comprehend wtf I am actually reading and make sense of it in my brain.  I have to re-read sentences so much as I forget the previous written words that I cannot help think that im a total moron and as u can get makes me look like a total penis at work.\n\n4 - I cannot stop  smoking weed when I am in my flat - Ive had a problem with weed since I was about 15yo .. I admitted I had a habit at the age of approx 25 and took steps to calm it down. I got to a happy place where I no longer required the need for a spliff whilst I was at work or not in my flat, however due to the next issue and most likely complete bordem, Im finding it very hard to not smoke at home.\n\n5  -  I find it very difficult to get to sleep unless Ive had a wank and climaxed.  This has been a issue since my childhood.  This has knackered my penis many times, its been scarred, bled, now leans all wonky when erect and naturally my testicles are non existent.  I admitted to myself that I had a problem with porn also in my mid 20\\`s, but as I found out the medical profession hasnt got a clue what to do apart from to give you a load of leaflets so u can sit in a room with a load of strangers and make peace with god. Ive thought about visiting a self harm clinic but decided against it as im not to sure if it can be classed as self harm. Somehow I can still get an erection, but it hurts, yet a part of my brain forces me to do it anyway :(\n\nIt got so much for me at one point that I even quit my well paid full time job, left my flat, friends, family and possessions behind and buggered off to a country that views any pornography as illegal and prisionable for a few months in order to try and curb it .. that didnt work n in hindsight ... I shouldnt have taken my laptop.\n\nThere are other \"main\" issues but id be here all day with the speed of my typing so I stop there.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA while ago I randomly met someone at a friends gathering that worked with autistic kids and it was suggested to one of my friends by them that maybe I should seek a diagnosis due to how I acted and spoke ( I assume they didn't want to hurt my feeling by suggesting it directly)?\n\nIm in my 40\\`s and after being called a weirdo for the past 30 odd years, being autistic had never crossed my mind as I thought it was something completely different ( blame the rain man film ), but I looked it up on the web and had a read and a few things struck a cord. \n\nThe GP gave me a test to do, then I had a long phone call discussing my issues with someone else and then was told that they do think there was a possibility I may be on the spectrum and advised that I had been given an appointment for a diagnosis.  \n\n2 years passed and I did my diagnosis.  This consisted of me describing a children's picture book, making some really crap stories up with random objects and trying to figure out how some patterns fit together :/ .....  I was told that I was not autistic.  I disagreed with what I was being told by the doctor due to the (imo) pathetic test for \"adults\" & autism, but was pretty much forced to accept that decision and once again told to bugger off and given a load of crappy leaflets.\n\nEver since then its been a slippery mental slope downwards .. Ive lost faith in trying to seek help cos all that seems to happen is that I embarrass myself when Im honest about my issues and then get told there is nothing wrong with me.   I am not not eating everyday, for some reason I do not feel hungry so I dont eat, even tho in the back of my mind I know thats not good.\n\nThere is a part of my brain that is forcing me to type this even tho Ive been looking at this 1 screen for about 4 hrs ...  All of the problems above are still present and are really fucking me up mentally .. I dont know if im typing this just to get it out or if I am asking for help .. I do know that if i didnt have any family to hurt, I would have jumped off a bridge by now.",

    "selftext": "I've been trying to post this on other UK Subreddits, but this was removed everywhere else. My main questions were about living in a tent and all I need to know and I was providing background information about me. Now, I will just post my background information, as it it about my mental state and advice about living in a tent is not what this subreddit is about.  \nI'm in a really bad place and would like to know if anyone else feels like this, experience something similar? Anyone else just at this point, that everything around is just so weird and feels alien and wrong? Please share and, maybe, tell if you were able to get out of this mess?\n\n**Background**\n\nI am a male, nearly 34. I am originally from Europe and been living in the UK for around 15 years now. I am at this point in life, where I am so lost and confused and this life thing looks so ridiculous to me.\n\nI live in Devon and I am employed full-time as a Software Developer. I earn more than a minimum, but still, the wage is ridiculously low for a Software Developer with a 4 years’ experience. Though might be exactly right for my skills and more about that later. I have a partner and a son. Our relationship is over and the legal battle for our son that I have started is ongoing, with me wanting him to go to school and my partner want to homeschool him. This was the last tipping point for me and my mental state.\n\nPlus, the rent. Even in Devon, the rent is horrible. Paying like 60% of my salary for the rent and bills. It’s just a constant struggle and survival, just to be able to pay the rent.\n\n \n\n**About me**\n\nFor the whole of my life, I suffered with a social anxiety or some other mental health problem, where I cannot effectively communicate with people and make friendships / relationships. I was diagnosed disabled due to social anxiety back in 2016, but not wanting to spend my life being disabled, I pushed myself as much as I could, finished university and got a job as a Software Developer. Everything was and is a constant struggle, though. School, first job at a factory, university – constant thoughts about a suicide, feeling depressed, crying, being alone, sometimes mocked for being constantly quiet, people heavily disliking me for being so quiet and not communicating.\n\nPlus, my ugly face. Puts people off. Just the looks I get from the others. I've tried dating apps like Tinder, Bumble, and Hinge, but with over 1,000 swipes on Tinder, I didn't get a single match. I've tried dating in real life, too, as much as my anxiety would allow, but here is where my “amazing” communication skills kick in. And the combination of my face + my communication skills = creature from the other planet who cannot adapt to this world.\n\nThe truth is – I want to communicate. I want to have friends and I want to have relationships. I don’t want to be alone, but when I go out there in the real life I just sit there quietly. My teammates don’t bother with me anymore – they just leave me be. I see how they feel uncomfortable being with me. So, they don’t bother asking me anything. They just don’t bother me. And that’s fair – most people act with me like that. They talk a lot with each other, while I am sitting quietly there whole day and feeling depressed about it. I imagine what vibes I give. A while back, my manager, before asking me something, said something in the realms of: “Sorry for dragging you in, I know you don’t like talking…” Oh, if only you knew how I love talking. How I love to be able to talk to people, make connections, being able to open my mouth.\n\nI am sure that some good people will advise me to see my GP and therapist. I did. I had 3 set of therapies from different NHS therapists. It’s completely ineffective. Standard CBT that NHS can offer don’t do nothing to me. For several years, I have also been on different medications with steady increased dosages – no effect. Not a slightest. I am waiting for the autism assessment. I feel so alienated, feel like such an alien in this world and it’s just crazy how I’m not able to talk to people. Last year I’ve asked for a brain scan, because of the way I feel. My GP agreed and a comprehensive brain scan was done. Nothing abnormal was found. Which, in my mind, is abnormal. This cannot be right. I am not right. I’ve been called the quietest person they ever seen. I’ve been called “a pouty, who just sits there while everyone else is communicating and I will never find a girlfriend like that”. I’ve been asked why I am so quiet. All that, while I am so eager to talk to people, make friends, speak.\n\n**My partner**\n\nHere's me contradicting myself, right? I have a partner and a son. Well, I guess in some ways. But listen to this. I am 34 and I had only one relationship, despite of trying for many years. I’ve been trying to find someone for over 6 years before my partner. Actively going on the dating websites, with a few real-life attempts. Zero. Zero dates I got from that.\n\nI guess, eventually, after trying very hard, you can get what you’ve been looking for. So, I found my partner. We met at my first, factory work. We were really good friends and that’s that. So good, that we’ve been telling our secrets to each other and so good that she could honestly tell me that she didn’t see me as a man. Until later point in our life. You see, she is also a lost lady. Lost, unhappy, depressed. She was also afraid of men and eventually, she settled for me. I never felt love to her, neither did she. But we got together. We had a child. At some points she made me feel that I am a person, a real human being. That I worth something and am most important person for her, putting me at the top of the world. At the same time, she could abuse my weaknesses, taking advantage of my ugliness and anxiety, putting herself as almost being my god. With the sayings like “pray that I will talk to you” and “if not me, you would stay with you friend” (My friend being fleshlight, you can google it if you dare).\n\nWhy are we separating? Many reasons. Covid hit and my partner went full conspiracy mode. Like, it became her reality. It’s crazy, the things she would say. Like, looking at the Boris Johnson in the newspaper and saying, “he is not real and doesn’t look like a Boris Johnson and it’s just his clone”. Her friend’s dog died and she blamed the covid vaccine (yes). There are reptilians walking among us.\n\nThe she decided she won’t be working for the rest of her life and proudly repeating it. Just like that, without having a conversation with me about it. Decided to homeschool our son, make him vegetarian, not vaccinate him... All not even considering asking for my opinion.\n\nSo enough is enough. No relationship is 100% better than this kind of relationship. It’s horrible.\n\n**My son**\n\nHere comes my son. The only person I ever loved. I don’t remember that I ever loved my mom or dad. But my son, he is a unique person. The only person I am able to look in the eye and don’t feel anxious and the only person that can look into my eye and don’t feel disgusted and turn his head away.\n\nI don’t want him to be like me. I don’t want him to suffer his whole life like I do. That’s why I started a legal battle against my partner, who plans to homeschool him. I want my son to communicate, find friends and be happy. Get educated. We have no friends with other children here, so, basically, they go out on the playground for hour or two and then they stay at home. That’s it. And if she will be homeschooling him – this will be happening for many years to come.\n\nHowever, I don’t know how this all will fold out. If I will win the battle and will have a custody of my son – what’s then? Dedicate my life to raising my son, while being a loser single father with no friends? Just accept it and focus on my son? I’m not sure about that. I just don’t know. How will my son feel growing up with a loser father? Plus, I can lose my job as a Software Developer any time. And I will, at some point. The thing is – I don’t really understand too much. I understand some things, so this, plus my determination and trying as hard as I can – that’s what still keeps me on my job. But this won’t be enough forever. I will lose my job someday, when the manager finally will see that I am not progressing. I do believe this problem with understanding things comes from my mental state, I have problems with processing information. I’m sure it’s not a language barrier, it’s just weird. As a few examples – I passed my practical driving test on 7^(th) attempt only and was the first person to have 7 attempts in my instructor’s 20 years of teaching. Even on my first factory work I was messing up so bad, because I couldn’t understand simple things and my supervisors stopped trusting me with some specific tasks. My colleague once asked me to get sausage rolls for him from the shop. I didn’t understand what he meant. I know what sausage rolls are, I know what the shop is, I understood all words he said, but I didn’t understand what he said. About 5 seconds later it hit my head, what he meant, when he started explaining it in details.\n\nIf, somehow, my partner would win and will go back to our home country with our son – this is where I’ve decided that I would go sleeping in a tent while working full-time. Save some money. Then travel the world, talk to people. Just like in the movies. Being happy. Though, I know, life is a not a movie and everything won’t be as good as I imagine. But I would like to try.\n\nThird option is if our son, for some reason, will be taken by social services. Sometimes, I think, that I don’t mind it. But I am very afraid of 2 things. First, is that our son never been separated from us and never stayed with anyone else and his mom didn’t want no nursery for him. What a shock he would experience, if suddenly he would be take away from his parents and put somewhere else without seeing us? And the second, most terrifying thing is if he would get adopted by evil people. There is evil out there. That terrifies me. You never know what type of people would take him.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI was diagnosed disabled in 2016. I had no friends, no family, nobody around. Was completely alone. I was sitting there in my flat, getting money from the government, watching movies, playing games. This is probably where I should have stayed. Why did I need to make these attempts on life? I don’t understand this game of life, I don’t know how to play it.",

    "selftext": "My (32F) partner (35M) had a job, friends, and was passionate about rock climbing when we met 3 years ago. Soon after, he had an injury which meant he couldn’t climb, which also lost him all of his friends who are very active in the climbing community. He also stopped working. He became depressed and started self medicating with weed. He’s had two jobs that he’s held for only a few weeks, but has had to quit due to persecutory delusions about co-workers bullying him or trying to get him fired. He’s always had paranoid/persecutory delusions, but never very severe. He spent most of the three years on the sofa, while I did everything around the house and worked. We’ve been living off his savings and my income. \n\nAbout a month ago, he had a drug induced psychotic episode where he had grandiose beliefs and started behaving erratically. I had to temporarily move out. He settled a few days after and agreed to get medication and treatment so I moved back in. A few more days go by and he’s suddenly very spiritual, manic and is now refusing medication. I had to call the mental health team because he started believing he was a prophet and was self injuring to prove that he can’t be harmed. Two psychiatrist came to assess. One kickstarted the process of getting him detained. The other came with an ambulance ready to detain him, but didn’t believe he needed detainment after his assessment (he masked very well). The psychiatrist said that the community team will have to visit everyday and will discuss treatment options because it’s likely a mood disorder. The next morning a community mental health nurse came for 5 minutes to ask how he was doing, then discharged him. How do you go from nearly detaining someone the night before to discharge in the morning less than 12 hours apart?  I’ve worked in an acute MH ward, why didn’t the 2nd psychiatrist believe me when I reported how serious things were getting? \n\nMy partner is still very manic and the neighbors have been concerned. He’s continuing to self harm. I’ve tried reasoning with him about getting a psychiatric evaluation and meds, but he’s the “happiest he’s ever been” and he’s saying that I just need to accept this new him. He’s very angry at me for for calling MH services and “betraying” him. \n\nI’m exhausted and I’m leaving. He’s refusing any treatment or help. And I feel that the mental health system failed us. \n\nIn the past he had a probable diagnosis of bipolar disorder and he was seeking help, but the community team just discharged him. I think he’s had either BPII or cyclothymic disorder for years, but never been diagnosed. If I leave, he will self-neglect because he is out of money and can’t hold a job. This feels awful because I love him, but I can’t keep going anymore. It’s taken a toll on my own mental health.\n\nEdit: I’d also like to add that I work for the NHS, so it feels even worse slaving away for a system that can’t even help you when you need it.",

So sorry if wrong place. \n\nSo last week I overdosed, I regret it, I got help and I am fine, at least physically. Its something I'd really like never to do again. Got out Tuesday night. \nWhile I was there I also got sober. Just out of my crisis team apt they booked me as a condition of my discharge. \n\nI was held on a section 5,2 till I could be assessed to see if I was safe to go home, I was and got an appointment to see the crisis team about referrals and where to go from here. I don't really have any support formal or informal. \n\nI just got out this apt and I am so upset and angry. I'm not getting a referral for anything but put on another wait list that might take months (estimated 3-4) to see a psych about the fact I need a diagnosis as the diagnosis from when I was 13, now in my 30s doesn't actually fit). They'll also send my GP a letter to resources for prescribing medication (because of an old bipolar dx my GP won't prescribe me anti dependants or meds. I really need a meds change and help, my GP has said they aren't confident in prescribing to me). \n\nThey are saying I should just keep seeing the drug and alcohol team (who seem great but I REALLY need mental health support, umm suicide attempts are not normal, I am genuinely not okay) and then they suggested I maybe try to find a reduced rate counsellor. \nApparently I don't need the community team, they suggested my anxiety, panic attack, paranoia and suicide are all alcohol related or manageable. I always come across as okay as I don't show emotion well. \n\n To be fair the drinking makes it worse, and when I was clean and sober several years ago I had no abnormal anxiety or depression but my mental health pre dates my drinking by about 16 years,  I started seeing cahms at 11. I've been out of services the past 9 years and didn't need them, but I do now. I don't know how to get help. I HATE them. I'm so angry I'm shaking and crying at a bus stop.\n\nThe night I took the od I told the crisis team lady on the phone I was going to OD and she hung up, I OD'd called back hysterical and she called an ambulence then hung up without saying good bye. I get they had to call an ambulence but I don't get why they couldn't have talked to me for a little bit after or called me back while I was panicking and trying not to do bad things. Everytime I talk to them I feel worse and angrier and angrier. I'm not even an angry person, more a sad anxious scared person.\n\nI can't go home, can't walk about as I'm going mad or ill do something daft, so going to an AA meeting I'm not even sure I want to go to AA. I am so angry I'm crying on a bus typing this. So sorry for the ramble but I'm going to explode or something and need to get it out.

    "selftext": "My daughter (16) has been struggling with her mental health things came to a head this week when she took an overdose and ended up in hospital. She was in the children's ward for a couple of nights and I stayed there with her. Once the Doctors declared she was physically fit to leave we had to get a sign off from the CAHMS (adolescent mental health) team. The nurse came round to tell us they would be with us shortly they were currently with someone and had 2 more to see that morning but shouldn't be too long. \n\nThere were 2 CAHMS teams on the ward that morning meaning that both teams were with a child at the time with 2 more kids/families to see and then my daughter. That's a minimum of 5 kids/families that were on the children's ward because of mental health issues, and if they were there it was because it was a serious situation like ours.\n\nThat number in itself is horrifying but after the CAHMS team spoke to my daughter and myself they confirmed we would hear from the crisis team within 7 days and we were on a waiting list to be seen by the CAHMS team in our area. When I asked what the waiting list would be I was told it is currently 11 months. I know our NHS is struggling but to say we'll get to you hopefully within a year after attempting suicide is insane.\n\nWe have not been able to get an appointment with the Doctors in the last year as they are not seeing anyone, all we've had is a text message of \"useful\" links to self help websites and books on Amazon we could buy. And they've given us details of an organisation called Vitamins for which we did a self referral back in November. But again this organisation has a waiting list and we were told it could be 5 months at least.\n\nMy wife suffers from depression and that she is on numerous medications for herself and she is slowly losing her eyesight due to diabetes her appointment for eye surgery has been postponed 4 times now due to Covid, my son has his own mental health struggles but he is 3 hrs away in a different city at uni confined to a 1 bedroom studio apartment student accommodation trying to do what is essentially now an online degree. I'm in the middle trying to reassure everyone that it's all going to be ok and we'll get help and this will all be sorted out. But it's not ok the situation is f##ked. There seems to be no help unless your prepared to wait nearly a year I know a self help websites may help some people but this is not applicable to all and is not a suitable treatment for suicidal depression\n\nIt just seems almost impossible at the moment to get any kind of help and support there must be options out there even if it's private. People's lives depend on this and all we seem to get at the moment is just wait we'll get to you eventually",

    "selftext": "So just because I have a staunch hatred of the concept, labelling and current culture of personality disorders doesn’t mean everyone does or that the treatments aren’t useful for PD’s and other conditions.\n\n- East London NHS Foundation Trust has [Youtube videos](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeEBLpkk4vtN18FqyZeIx4di6hGaJZU_a&si=QfJqwXDf2c4h6i9i) for MBT & iMBT* modules (not exactly sure of the difference). \n\nELFT seems to a leading NHS trust in terms of PD treatment (unsure why)*\n\n- /u/AgitatedFudge7052 put me on to this document regarding the [protocol for diagnosing BPD/EUPD](https://www.elft.nhs.uk/sites/default/files/2022-01/da3623_appendix_1._beds_luton_bpd.pdf) which again is written by ELFT for use in Bedfordshire. \n\nNot sure if this protocol is area-specific but it’s worth checking if your local trust has a similar thing in place as you can cross reference and evidence for your case for/against EUPD. Thank you u/AgitatedFudge7052\n\n- I found a Q&A from Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust (CANDI) on whether they offer PD treatment (spoiler alert: apparently they do) and how they implement it. This is specific to CANDI’s catchment area but again double check if your trust has a similar document.\n\n- YouTube Channel “Borderliner Notes” focuses on Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD). It has interviews with key figures in PD research and treatment including Marsha Lineham (who developed DBT) and Otto Kernberg (who theorised about narcissism and developed Transference-Focused Psychotherapy, another treatment used for EUPD)\n\n- The Psych Collective’s [YouTube playlist on Schema-Focused Therapy](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdFXYiKIH7BGh5f7VKGwJH7Ythe1MhiuE&si=QTzaqA_YFnjkxPl_) (SFT is yet another treatment for EUPD). This playlist is extensive and walks the viewer through the core ideas around the therapy and it’s uses. \n\nFor anyone without a good foundation in psychology it will no doubt be technical, potentially challenging to understand but still useful. So persevere if you can. I’ve watched a few of these videos and they are insightful.\n\n- BBC Radio 4 have a [webpage on Narcissism and NPD](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/sfHxNf7X4jpZ424Dwl6Fjk/is-narcissism-on-the-rise) with information and interviews including Dr Tennyson Lee, Consultant Psychiatrist working with ELFT’s DeanCross PD Service and Philippa Perry, a psychotherapist. \n\nI also found some research papers comparing different treatments for EUPD and overall effectiveness. If I can find the links I’ll edit them in. There are also some books I found on DBT adapted to help those who are diagnosed/self-diagnosed/suspect they’re neurodivergent. If I can find those I’ll link them later.\n\n- Cross-reference any PD diagnoses you may have/suspect against the diagnostic manuals - Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (Currently 5th Edition released 2013, Text revision update 2022) and International Classification of Diseases (Currently 11th Edition released 2019, implementation from 2022) \n\nSome psychiatrists will use previous editions of the DSM or ICD (especially DSM-IV or ICD-10 for both genuine and deceptive reasons, from my experience) - See EDIT 6.\n\n- Cross reference against NICE guidelines as well, the vast majority of psychiatrists, though not all will NOT use NICE guidelines to assess a PD even though they should. You can therefore pull them up on this. \n\nAnyone more knowledgeable on this topic, please feel free to add or correct anything I’ve written here.\n\nThis wasn’t the PD megathread I was originally planning to write but I may still do that if need be. If I can find resources on other PD’s I’ll do an edit. \n\nStart educating yourself on diagnostic processes, NHS policy, differential diagnoses, misdiagnoses and co-morbidities. so you don’t get tripped up. \n\nA lot (though not all) mental health professionals won’t like educated patients, well fuck that it’s not about them. It’s your health, your life, your experience. \n\nTrust your gut because change never came from acceptance.\n\n**EDIT 1:** See /u/DiedreNightshade’s comment about their experience with ELFT’s PD services.\n\n**EDIT 2:** See /u/woodrebel’s comment re: iMBT groups\n\n**EDIT 3:** See /u/Radpiglet's detailed comment with more resources.\n\n**EDIT 4:** Edited as I’ve reworded the paragraphs about intentional harm and diagnosing. This ISN’T the experience of every patient but anecdotal from my own experience.\n\n**EDIT 5:** Following on from /u/Willing_Curve921’s comment, here’s a series of YouTube videos on [Mentalisation and MBT](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaZguIPxZjqbBBj3V_kwef1DPKoqXj1ok&si=IKjnzUBV-ECjVOpy) from the Anna Freud Centre.\n\n**EDIT 6:** I’ve just received a research paper from /u/AgitatedFudge7052 that disputes the “spurious” diagnosis of EUPD - [Mulder and Tyrer (2023)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/01410768231164780). It starts with the following:\n\n>Twenty years ago, George Vaillant, in a paper entitled ‘The Beginning of Wisdom is Never Calling a Patient a Borderline’ noted that the diagnosis of borderline often reflects the clinician’s affective state rather than careful assessment.\n\nI've linked the study, so feel free to read further if it's of interest. Both Roger Mulder and Peter Tyrer are psychiatrists, so hopefully this adds weight but also acts as seeds of change, though only time will tell. Obviously they're only two people but it's definitely a start.\n\n**EDIT 7:** I stumbled across the [\"Personality Disorder Severity ICD-11 Scale\" (PDS-ICD-11)](https://app-rsjdxp-cms-prod-001.azurewebsites.net/media/qoplhfnf/pds-icd-11-english.pdf) which from what I can tell seems to be the tool professionals from specialist PD teams will use when assessing for a PD under the new ICD-11 criteria.\n\n**EDIT 8:** See /u/AgitatedFudge7052's recent comment about the book \"Taming the beast within\" by Professor Tyrer.",

Friend had phoned 111 and got told to \"listen to music\" to drown the bad thoughts. Two days later, friend attempted to end her life by overdosing and also self-harmed (although the wounds are superficial but still). She also left a suicide note in her phone notes saying thank you and sorry to those who helped and listed out names (my partner found the note).We had to phone the ambulance for her, which arrived over an hour and a half late (they called back to apologise that they were extremely busy so I commend them for that). Then everything went tits up from there. They kept my friend in the waiting room for seven hours, sick to her stomach with a paper bowl. She had puked stomach acid since she hadn't eaten anything for about a week at that time. She wasn't offered a bed of her own until seven hours into being in the hospital and then she was sent home about two in the morning which we found weird. She just overdosed and they had found nothing in her blood. It's a good thing there was nothing, but we got no calls or any advice what to do if she had some sort of symptom while she was at home. They sent home a suicidal person without contacting me and my partner that they were sending her home. We just had to trust that our friend really got on a taxi and told the driver to go to her house. The next day, she got a call from her GP and referred her to a mental health professional for an appointment yesterday. Before yesterday however, she struggled again and wanted to kill herself again. She wanted to walk out the door and never come back, which me and my partner threatened to let her family know that it has come to that. She backed down because she didn't want them to know. We convinced her to phone 111 and get help again. They referred her to another team who just told her to \"stay alive until her appointment on Wednesday.\" Like gee, why didn't she think of that? Wednesday came and the person her GP referred her to just went, \"I don't know why your GP referred you to me.\" So she's been passed on to one person to another every time she called 111. We're at a loss. My partner and I are exhausted. We're trying our best to keep her up, but it does get mentally draining. It's been better recently but we don't want to risk her getting rock bottom again. She wants to get better. We want her to get better. But the mental health system here is just utter shite.",

I’m so so starved of human interaction and physical affection(I haven’t had a hug in nearly 3 years) I think I’ve finally hit my breaking point, I’m just constantly on the edge of breaking down. I spoke to my GP a week and half a go who referred me to the mental health team but the waiting list is fucking long it could be months until I hear from them and I can’t afford to go private. I’m just at a point that I don’t think I can come back from. I’m so so lonely, it physically hurts. As much as I enjoy talking to strangers online it just doesn’t feel the same as talking to people you actually know in real life. When everything goes back to normal my life will stay the same as it is now, the thought of that alone makes me jump in front of a train. \n\nBefore people say that I’ll make some friends or meet people once COVID is over, I’ve been like this for 5 years now (I was a shut in for a couple of years), I tried to get myself back out there but I didn’t have any luck, I’m really bad at social skills, I don’t understand people or their actions and I always end up saying the wrong thing. I’ve kept going because I kept telling myself ‘maybe today will be the day’ but that day never came and now I’m so so miserable, there’s no light at the end of tunnel for me. There never will be.

    "selftext": "Yes lack of funding contributes to a shit ton of issues but you can’t blame it for everything. The whole attitude problem so many mental health so called professionals have towards patients is just concerning. I and others have been let down time and time again. I used to just accept that the fact I’ve been treated so badly and neglected so much is because of the tories cutting the funding etc and it’s not the fault of the people working in mental health but after today I’ve realised it’s not even just about money.\nAfter several years of me fighting with my advocate to get specialist treatment at the maudesley for my complex treatment resistant mental health issues and autism- I finally got an assesment with the National psychosis unit in London in April. I just found out last week that they contacted my CMHT saying they think I should be admitted to their specialist unit and they are offering me a bed. I am currently at my local psych unit after yet another suicide attempt. In the last 2 years I have lost count of the amount of admissions I’ve had in this unit. At least 7. Everyone agrees this place is not helping me and they’re not equipped to help me. I was relieved that finally I would be getting specialist help as I’ve tried nearly everything with my local team and my local psych ward(so many different medications, therapy, even TMS, ECT was suggested even though there’s no evidence to say it will help someone with my problems) with no improvement.\nToday I found out in a meeting that my local team TURNED DOWN THE OFFER on my behalf without bothering to let me know. Not because there wasn’t any funding. But because they don’t think I need it as they are helping me already. They’re not.\nThey were so reluctant to even let me have an assessment with anyone other than them for years and now they just disregard that advice and decide to let me rot away(suffer) under their team for the foreseeable future. Until I manage to k*** myself. I don’t even know how they can decide on my behalf to refuse treatment offered. I am not under section and people keep saying I have capacity. So how on earth can they have the right to decline help offered to me without asking me? I’m mad they are blocking me from getting help but the fact they were allowed to block me is the part that makes me sick. I’m a fucking adult yes I have mental health issues and autism but that doesn’t mean I can’t make my own decisions.\nEven if they let me go to the specialist I think it would be too late now if I’d had this years ago it might have helped enormously but I was gonna give life one last try with this before offing myself but I’m not even allowed that. \n\nIf it was really about saving money and resources then they would’ve saved money long term and short term if they fucking helped me properly so I don’t have to live on benefits and going in and out of local unit for the rest of my life. I did well at school and many people say I had the potential. So instead of fucking letting the right services help me they instead want me to keep suffering so I’m incapable of getting a job and paying taxes and ultimately cost the government money in the long term. My mum worked for the nhs for 20 years and yet when me or her need help we get this.\nI’ve had to pay £130 hour for private therapy and I can’t afford much longer.",

After the initial admin (confidentiality, review, if we feel you are a risk to yourself or others, etc.…) my counsellor then said “so, what is it that you want from these sessions?” A simple question but one that I just couldn’t answer. I tried to explain to them that there is so much going on that it has all just become a messy knot of feelings, thoughts, sensations, etc.… Like a ball of scribble that has no beginning, or end. I just broke down, crying, and said that I just want to stop feeling like I don’t want to be alive anymore. I feel numb and agitated at the same time, I feel lonely, but don’t want to talk to anyone as I now don’t know how to interact with anyone without being “fake happy”. I have no plans to end my life and I have two children that are my absolute world when I see them. But the feeling on not wanting to be alive doesn’t go away. \n\nSo, I spoke for 40 mins, going off on various tangents, reliving various childhood experiences and then, we came to the end of the session and the counsellor asked how I felt. “Drained, tearful and numb” was my response. They asked if I was in a safe place and was going to be “ok”. I said I was. I was at home, alone, and had to go back to work. When the zoom call ended, I sat, totally numb, and knowing that I had a whole week until I could talk to them again, a week of increasing anxiety over what I would say, how I would feel, etc.… I hope that this starts to help me and appreciate that this is a bit of a rambling post. I guess I wanted to vent to a group which may understand what I’m feeling. Friends’ responses to my first session were all “well, that’s good, you must feel ‘lighter’ having got it off your chest”. They mean well but it’s so hard to explain to people who are going through it or haven’t been through it. Anyway, thanks for those who have taken the time to listen. \n\n***\\~ May you all be happy.

    "selftext": "Hi there everyone, in need of advice. I'm going to cross-post this in quite a few places, so apologies if you've already seen it around. A lot of background info incoming, my main question is the bit bolded underneath. \n\nI'm 17 and I applied to a bunch of jobs recently that I never thought I'd hear back from, including one at an fun looking place that I won't name.  I'm a huge fan of gaming and have a bit of retail experience, being able to cope socially when I have a role and familiarity with what I'm doing. \n\nLo and behold, over two weeks later I hear back from this company. They ask me for an interview over at the premises on Monday and I'm grinning ear to ear. However, I see this email a couple days before the interview slot. I'm already cramming for mock exams on Tuesday/Wednesday/Thursday.  \n\nI book the train tickets, research a ton about the company and the role of a game operator instead of revising, and the day before (now) I'm breaking down. For a few reasons... \n\n* stressing about the train. I can count the times I've ever been on a train on one hand and I've never went myself. I'm so nervous about the process - what platforms, where's the mobile scanner, what if I get stuff stolen, what if someone sits next to me what if I miss my stuff etc. \n* stressing about the walk. The business is a 15 mins walk from the station. Even using Google Maps I'm scared I'll get lost and for some reason my stupid brain thinks I'll be judged for walking down the streets in work slacks and high heeled boots. \n* stressing about a taxi, to skip the walk. Again  can count the times I've ever been on a taxi on one hand and I've never called for or got one myself.  Will there be tons near the station? How do I call for one? What's the etiquette inside them? Will the driver be dodgy? \n* this is a completely new area to me that's pretty far away from home (in my standards anyway)\n\nSo silly, I know, but I'm paranoid. \n\nI'm in an awful situation because my siblings are so proud of me for getting an interview, I've told my friends, and my Dad (begrudgingly) offered to drive me to the station. My Mum and Dad think I'll bail. When I said I'm a bit worried about taxis, asking for advice and they gave me vague answers, they asked me if I already booked the tickets and said \"just cancel it we'll pay you back\". I feel an obligation to myself and to my siblings/friends to go to the interview and really want to prove my parents wrong. I really want this first job and think it would be a good stepping stone for me. Plus, I can't let the time I spent on preparing for the interview instead of revising go to waste. \n\nLogically, now I'm so distressed and still awake in the middle of the night, I know I'll bail and it's killing me. I'll just have to email at 7 in the morning or something equally ridiculously unprofessional and make up an excuse to postpone the interview/do it by phone. \n\nI think I could've mitigated my worries and confidently gone to the interview if I had a friend escorting me to the train and to the taxi, meeting up to do things with me occasionally that required I travel in these ways. Perhaps they'd start out talking to the train conductor, calling a taxi, talking to the taxi person for me. Then we'd progress onto me trying out those things with them in tow. After having done this, I reckon I could tackle any journey by myself confidently. \n\nObviously the night before I'm screwed. I have to bail, my brain is going haywire and I feel like an elephant  stepped on my chest. But I'd really like to prevent this sort of situation in the future and learn how to travel. **Is there a buddy system to equip people with autism/social anxiety (I'm not sure if I just have the latter or both, haven't been diagnosed w either) with unfamiliar social situations like travelling? I'm fine with paying for this sort of thing out of my own savings, I need to escape this prison of constant anxiety to go uni and have a life.** \n\nThanks a lot, whoever read all that.",

It’s an opportunity for us to express our feelings, emotions and thoughts. It brings us all together. Even though we are all completely strangers to one another, it feels like we are a small family at the same time. And that’s what people need during these times, for others to be there for them, for others to show some support and exchange help to one another. \n\nSo, that being said, as the title says, I want you all to know, if you’re suffering in anyway, please try your best to get it out of your system. It doesn’t have to be in person to your family member or friend, you can do so on social media to a person you don’t even know, this is why this subreddit was created, to be there for one another. I just wanted to give you all a heads up, that whenever you need me, I’ll be here for you. Just drop me a message at any point and I’ll get back to you. We need to work together in order to become a happier nation. Times are tough, but so are you. \n\nPM’s open for you whenever you want or need a chat. :)\n\nThanks you for reading!",

My working theory is that it used to feel like we were headed in a generally positive direction, and although bad things existed, we (as a species? a country?) were slowly but surely taking steps to make things better and to reduce suffering.\n\nNow I feel like we’re going the other way. Obviously there are still groups of people doing great things, and the majority of people just want to live their lives comfortably without actively causing harm, but I feel like whatever stoppers were previously in place to stop (or at least temper) powerful people/corporations from acting badly have been removed, and we’re on a runaway train towards increased inequality and suffering.\n\nThe way the current government are getting away with things (e.g. billions disappeared into a failed test and trace system and PPE scandal during covid, very obviously defunding the NHS to the benefit of private healthcare providers, allowing the housing crisis to explode unchecked etc.) is incredible, and at the moment the ‘alternative’ we have is another poorly led party. It all feels wrong and staged.\n\nIs anyone else feeling like this? I just feel like we’re headed for dystopia (for those who aren’t already living in one).",

    "title": "What Constitutes a Qualified/Legitimate Counsellor in the UK? A (hopefully) useful guide",
    "selftext": "Hope this is OK, but I wanted to write this not only in response to the two recent media requests on this sub, but also in response to the number of posts/questions I've seen asking about how to find a legit therapist or how to understand an organisation's hiring process for counsellors.\n\nI hope that any other counsellors/therapists in this sub can help me out if I miss anything out or don't explain things properly.\n\nFirst things first, it's true that the term \"counsellor isn't a protective title. Technically, anybody *could* say that they're a counsellor or therapist, but here's the thing:\n\n# They're unlikely to get very far.\n\nIt is pretty much impossible to get a paying job as a counsellor within an organisation without the proper qualifications.   If a person tries to set up private practice, they will find it very difficult to advertise effectively.\n\nSites such as Counselling Directory ( [https://www.counselling-directory.org.uk/](https://www.counselling-directory.org.uk/)) and the BACP directory  ([https://www.bacp.co.uk/search/Therapists](https://www.bacp.co.uk/search/Therapists)) will not allow people to advertise on those sites unless they are qualified and legitimate.\n\n**If you aren't sure where to find a legitimate therapist, approved directories like this are the best place to start because you know that the counsellor had to undergo a vetting process to be allowed on the site.**\n\nSo, hopefully that addresses unqualified counsellors, but what exactly constitutes a \"qualified\" one:\n\n# What Training and Qualifications do Counsellors Need?\n\nThe truth is that there are multiple routes to becoming a qualified counselor in the United Kingdom. Some people will choose to do a degree \\[EDIT: Removed course I mentioned as apparently it doesn't do the job\\]\n\nHowever, I think it's fair to say that the way the majority of people (or at least a large number of people) enter the profession is by completing a Level 4 Diploma.  In order to complete a Level 4, most people have to complete a Level 3 unless they have comparable qualifications or experience, and in order to complete a Level 3, most places would ask you to complete a Level 2 course.\n\nI thought it would be helpful to outline what each course entails so that if you are thinking of seeing a counsellor you have some idea of the work they had to put in so that they could be deemed a fit and proper person to work with you.\n\nThis isn't to say \"*look how hard counsellors work*\" but to reassure you that, if you're seeing a qualified counsellor, you won't be lumped with someone who doesn't know what they're doing.\n\n# Level 2 | 3 Months\n\nTo be honest, I think there are different Level 2 courses. Mine was called *Level 2 Award in Counselling Concepts*.\n\nOn this course, we got introduced to the concept of \"Person-Centered Counselling\" which is the primary therapeutic model that we learn about here in the UK. Counsellors can, of course, later go of to learn other therapies like CBT or  psychodynamic, but it starts here.\n\nWe learn about basics such as the \"Core Conditions\" (*empathy, congruence and unconditional positive regard*) why they are *necessary and sufficient* for counselling (according to the person-centered model)  and about \"conditions of worth.\"\n\nThe course is a mix of practicing basic listening skills with peers and written assignments.\n\nThe course I was on was regulated by OFqual and any legitimate Level 2 should also be regulated.\n\n# Level 3 | 1 Year\n\nThe *Level 3 Certificate in Counselling Skills* is a year long course.\n\nExtensive work is done to practice the skills required to offer counselling to someone. This often takes the form of \"triads\" in which one student acts as a counsellor, a second student acts as their client, and a third observes and offers feedback.\n\nThis is an invaluable process in which we learn a great deal about how to actually work with people, hold space for them, enter their frame of reference and help them to explore their issues.\n\nLots of written assignments are done around things like diversity, contracting and safeguarding, about how the use of certain skills impacts the counselling process and so on.\n\nWe learn more the theory and explore other models of therapy besides person-centered.\n\nIn order to pass the course, not only do the written assignments have to be up to scratch, but we also have to record a 30 minute counselling session in which we demonstrate competence.\n\n# Level 4  | 2 years plus\n\nThe level 4 diploma is the minimum qualification that a person needs to be considered a qualified counsellor.\n\nIt is an intense course.\n\nWe do lots of \"skills work\" to improve how we work as counsellors and dive much deeper into the theory side of things which really helps us to understand why we do what we do in the way that we do it.\n\nWritten assignments cover counselling skills, equality and diversity, professional and organisational issues (ethics, boundaries etc), research, and I think something else that I've probably forgotten.\n\nAt some point, we have to complete a \"Fitness to Practice\" assessment similar to the recorded 30 minute session at Level 3 but more intense - we need to be better counsellors in this assessment than we were at Level 3.\n\nThe \"Fitness to Practice\" means that our tutor (a teacher and qualified counsellor) deems that we're fit and proper to be able to work with people as a counsellor. However, that does not mean that we are then qualified counsellors.\n\nWhat it means, is that we're able to start a placement. This is where we go into a counselling agency or charity and provide 100 hours of counselling to actual clients (rather than just our peers).\n\nIt is only after completing all of the assignments, proving that we've done the 100 hours and putting together a portfolio that we pass the course.\n\nThe Level 4 course technically takes two years but lots of people find that it takes longer than that to complete the 100 hours, so it's not unheard of for it to take 3 years or more.\n\n# BACP and Other Professional Bodies\n\nThe British Association of Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP) have done an excellent job at promoting themselves as *the* professional body for counsellors.\n\nUnfortunately, this has created **the misconception** that a counsellor *must* be registered with the BACP in order to be considered a legitimate, regulated therapist.\n\n**This is not true.**\n\nIt is, of course, wise to register with a professional body for reasons of professional development and accountability, but the BACP is not the only option.\n\nOther organisations include:\n\n**Counselling & Psychotherapy in Scotland (COSCA)**\n\n[http://www.cosca.org.uk/](http://www.cosca.org.uk/)\n\n**Irish Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (IACP)**\n\n[http://www.irish-counselling.ie/](http://www.irish-counselling.ie/)\n\n**The National Counselling Society (NCS)**\n\n[http://www.nationalcounsellingsociety.org/](http://www.nationalcounsellingsociety.org/)\n\n**United Kingdom Council for Psychotherapy (UKCP)**\n\n[http://www.psychotherapy.org.uk/](http://www.psychotherapy.org.uk/)\n\nThe BACP is certainly the largest and has the most \"brand recognition\" which is why a lot of counselling jobs ask for BACP status - but it is perfectly OK for a counsellor to be qualified and not a BACP member. If a job asks for BACP accreditation, a member of the NCS, for example, could state that their membership is every bit as valid and holds as much weight as the BACP.\n\nThis is not a criticism of the BACP nor am I suggesting that a counsellor registered with them isn't the real deal. They are. Just that they're not the only option.\n\nI appreciate that this is a lot, but I hope it's in some way helpful to those who might be unsure about working with a counsellor.\n\nI'm sure there are lots of seasoned therapists in this sub who may be able to expand and/or clarify anything I've written here and may be able to offer things I haven't thought of.\n\nthanks for reading.\n\nEDIT: I should add that after Level 4 - lots of people choose to go on to complete Level 5 courses in order to further their skills and knowledge.",

For many conditions that require expertise then you’re looking at paying easy £60 per hour and that’s often once weekly. How are people that are mentally ill and often unable to work full time expected to pay that? They cannot. You can ask for concessionary rates but these are few in number.

Within 10 mins of meeting him he told me I was lucky that there was a welfare state and that there was worse things going on in Palestine.

Is that what he got from me after just 10 mins? I worry constantly about what people think of me so that did not help me in anyway. And that’s not all I eventually talked to him for about half hour about what I’ve been through which covered hardly anything. He then asked me if I believed in god! I said no because of archeology but I believe in Jesus because he was mentioned in the Quran other religions and Egyptian scrolls not meaning anything but that. He went on for a good half hour or more going on about how the only person that will judge me will be god at the gates of heaven! I was like wtf I just don’t understand what your point is. I even tried leaving but he made me come back into the room. Then going on about heaven and hell and judgement again I kept saying I don’t understand you. I don’t know what you’re trying to say til I just said I have to go and left. He also gave me meds that have dairy in them and I told him about that and other intolerances I have. I feel so disappointed. \nHave I misread things? Am I over reacting? Is this as bizar as my brain feels it is? Is this normal for a shrink appointment? I’m so confused",

I've been out of full-time work for about 6 weeks but have been doing some ad hoc shifts here and there to get some income in (unrelated field). \n\nFast forward to today and I had another interview back in the dream job but just couldn't do it despite being well prepared and up until last night I intended to go to it (first time I've intentionally not attended an interview in my life). I just feel numb and have no motivation. The thought of high pressure, deadlines, potential toxic colleagues and 5 days a week has just triggered me. That last job really took it out of me and I am clearly not even close to recovering... I guess there's a sadness from once being so keen to now just being completely nonchalant about working/having a career. Not sure how long I'll be in this rut for or how to get out of it.\n\nHugs in solidarity to everyone on this subreddit and wishing you all strength in your recovery ❤️",

    "selftext": "Hi all, as requested here is an update. [Last post was titled 'I suspect my Psychotherapist is doing Cocaine mid-session. Advice?](https://old.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthUK/comments/ss9hlj/i_suspect_my_psychotherapist_is_doing_cocaine/) To summarise the situation I'm in the UK/Great Britain and I started seeing a local Psychotherapist in late December due to various mental health issues. I chose him rather than go back to my old Counsellor because his bio said he had experience treating ADHD, which I strongly suspect I have.\n\nOur sessions are weekly and, because of the pandemic, all so far have been over Zoom. More than once during our sessions he's excused himself, turned off the camera (But not the mic) and done I don't know what. Two sessions ago, when he came back on camera, he was rubbing his nose and sniffing excessively. Like really excessively. I suspected he was doing Cocaine, but a Commenter suggested it might be Ketamine based on how his demenour changed when he came back. Normally he's focussed on helping me and getting me to talk about whatever I want, I was talking about my friend whose Dad has dementia and how I could best support him, but when he came back he wanted me to talk about something we'd already talked about plenty in previous sessions. He kept repeating himself and seemed kind of lost, repeating how awful what had happened to me was and how could I've kept going through it all.\n\nThat was two sessions ago.\n\nAt the last session I set my laptop up to record what happened (Most sessions were on laptop, but recent ones have been on mobile due to me fucking my laptop up). He was ... all over the place. Constantly moving, from one side of the room to another, from one sitting place to another. He ate half a sandwich. He drank some tea. He ate the other half of the sandwich. He drank some more tea. Eventually he ended up in front of a window, causing the screen to split between the pure white of the window light and the jet black shadow of his figure.\n\nI'm pretty sure he did that deliberately as I'm pretty sure I heard him snort something when he did so.\n\nEven before that session I'd decided I was going to report him to the UKCP (UK Council of Psychotherapy) who he's registered with. Unfortunately I wasn't recording the session where he was rubbing his nose otherwise I'd've reported him by now. While his behaviour was bad in session I don't think it's enough to get him more than a talking to by the UKCP, which is what I want. A drug-addicted Psychotherapist is nobody's friend and I worry about other clients he's got, both current and future.\n\nObviously this could be all in my head and there's a totally innocent explanation for all this so I'm planning to, eventually, talk to him before I report him.\n\nWhat do you all think? Tomorrow is my next session so any thoughts or advice would be much appreciated.",

I can't pinpoint why but I hate it. Idk if it's to do with feeling lonely because they're happy in their jobs and relationships and I don't have the first and am not sure of the latter, but I wish it didn't happen. I love talking to them and I just wish I could do it without making myself feel like shit. Not too sure what to do. Maybe it's feeling like I've said something wrong all the time? Maybe it's reminding me how much I miss seeing friends in person? (I don't think so, I get the feeling it'd be worse if I did). Any ideas how to stop this and/or cope with it?",

    "selftext": "Hi, obligatory first post \\*wave \\*\n\nI'm currently studying Psychology and one of the things we're continually asked it 'What do you want to do?'.  Well, having worked in many areas, I decided to go towards counselling, my degree was focused that way (Psychology & counselling) and I was sure that's what I wanted. A year after I started I worked in a homeless shelter, a good one but I couldn't find the balance between emotional investment and professional separation. I was taking it home every night. People would say I'd make a great therapist because of my empathy but what they couldn't see was the emotional toll it was taking. Finally, I left there and began a much calmer support position. With the change, I also changed my degree and moved to Psychology (stand-alone). On realised that I might not be cut out for therapy I decided that having a degree focused on it would be too limiting. \n\nThen I started talking to my cousin. He is 8 years my junior and on a side of my family whom I avoid because of their toxic behaviours. One day he was spiralling, suicidal, reaching out on an open FB post saying he needed to talk and that's how I basically became his therapist. \n\nNow I will say, disclaimer, in no way do I feel qualified to be anyone personal therapist. However, when I tell you it was dire, it was dire. He was on the edge and going down fast. He had clinical anxiety, at the time undiagnosed, was self-harming and had zero trust in anyone at all and no self-worth. It started two years of support. Of building trust, constructing coping mechanisms, dealing with abuse within the family and getting his anxiety addressed. \n\nNow, nearly three years later, he's a different person. He's medicated, has ways to cope, he reaches out to others for support and has friends. He is on an honest-to-god dating site trying out his social skills, with my support obviously, its a war zone out there. I try to make sure he has some independence, I push him to question my opinions and do his own research, to make choices based on what he wants and not what he thinks I want to hear. There are defiantly some attachment issues but they're being addressed slowly and maybe one day he'll see someone who is qualified to support him through the rest of his life.\n\nI'm so proud of who he's become, of the achievements he's made in his life but it's solidified that I don't want to be a therapist. It's a hard job and I'm just not cut out for it. I think my calling is more research-based, so that's where I'm focusing. Kudos to my therapist colleagues, you do a difficult and exhausting job.",

    "title": "Mental health care needs reform",
    "selftext": "I have noticed that when you go into the system, it is ingrained in British culture to pester mentally ill or disabled people to get a job. You get to a point where if you are not capable of work and they have tried to force you to find work and failed at employment, you don't need to work anymore but come across hurdles before you get help into being in any kind of state where it would be reasonable for you to be going into employment. It is not just anything directly to do with any particular field of support like the people at the job centre or people who work in mental health support but more of a culture of expectations that are generally followed but are not always followed for example when you correctly explain that you cannot work then some people will be understanding and try their best to help with limited resources they've got.\n\nBehind the scenes, it feels like people have been influenced by the media narrative that people on any kind of benefits \"need to be more grateful\" or \"need to find a job\" or \"there is a job out there somewhere for you\". Or, if they are not following the media, there is some kind of tick box that says one must focus looking for employment, in the journey to \"better wellbeing\". Not anybody's fault except the government and a few bad apples that follow the narrative.\n\nThe ironic thing is, if you could actually get more support, you might be able to find a job that suits you.\n\nIt feels like the first thing a doctor considers is antidepressants. Yes, they are meant to see if \"other options\" help but am I wrong to think that this is just a sneaky way to say \"we have (allegedly) explored enough options to put you on antidepressants\". Then you have to follow up and make sure you are really focussed on monitoring how well the medication works. This can be deterimental to people who mentally cannot function and therefore cannot pester the mental health services for support. If they check up on you, all depends were you are at with the system but I think they shouldn't let this fall through the cracks and have effective systems at all stages in the process. It's almost like either they don't have systems in place to prevent negligence or they just think they will only deal with people who aren't too \"lazy\" to get help.\n\nSo if you cannot function mentally, what must you do? Pester the mental health services until they find help for you.\n\nNow you have to wait ages to get therapy. Sometimes you can have like one session and then they throw you in a room full of people. It might help or it might be too difficult to withstand.\n\nI personally haven't got to that stage yet. It is bizarrely easy to talk to someone who will help you find a job but not mental health support?\n\nWhen you do actually get to therapy. Correct me if I'm wrong but if you have a unique case of mental illness were you don't fit in with society's expectations, you are going to be told that you need to fit in more with what the government expect instead of objectively assessing what is helpful to you.\n\n\nAn example is, my guess is if you say you smoke cannabis, virtually anybody who works for the government will automatically assume that you just need to stop it and your mental health will get better. In some cases, it probably hurts people's mental health, others it might help and the rest it will neither help nor hinder. I don't think anybody who works in a profession is going to make this distinction. Some people, especially with specific medical conditions might be a lot worse without it. In all fairness, I would find it hard to condone the use of cannabis if I didn't know how it affected the person because it can seriously make people worse but I just wanted to point out the hypocrisy of it being a policy to discriminate against cannabis use and encourage antidepressants so casually. Even if I don't condone it, I wouldn't make such broad assumptions.\n\nAnother example is if you have a problem with how the system is built to discriminate against people with disabilities or, as mentioned in my example earlier, people who have had such little treatment or help that they feel the need to self-medicate aren't interested in the biased opinions of doctors who probably don't know anything about cannabis despite it being a staple of medicine for many people. There is excuses about why the system has to have certain rules so you just end up being discouraged to talk honestly about your problems because the system is based on the \"just give them drugs and hope they work\" and \"let's help them get back into employment\" ignoring all the problems including potential discrimination for people with certain disabilities. To clarify, this is to do with not fitting the status quo narrative in general but it's hard to give examples. I didn't really want to make cannabis my main example because there are so many problems with the status quo that aren't related to cannabis.\n\nMy final example is less to do with mental health services but more to do with employment. If you do not fit with the expectations such as not being able to deal with rude customers. Let's say you have coprolalia, autism or ADHD, which may impair your ability to be \"polite\" then your not employable because society cannot work with your issues. You have to be politically correct and fit in even when society hasn't adjusted to understand your needs.\n\nTo sum up what I'm saying, we're living in a society that upholds conservative ideologies that allows people with mental health issues either fall to the bottom and unable to function or they do function but just don't get any help so have to constantly deal with being burdened with problems. We won't dare question it and would rather stick with it. We rely on charities to support us but the government don't put in as much effort as the volunteers to help. We don't explore alternative therapies without doing our own research so that we know more than the doctor's \"put them on anti-depressants. In theory, there could be side effects that make it not worth it but we want to try them on you.\".\n\nMaybe I'm ignorant but I don't trust anti-depressants as much because of this line of thinking. I am not personally talking about self-medicating with doctors so I'm making some guesses on the perspective of the status quo's simplistic thought process about cannabis and other problems/potentially unexplored solutions. I found it difficult to fit in many examples and I feel like I mentioned cannabis too much which makes me think someone else could do a better job at explaining what I mean about the conservative values of society. I do trust that anti-depressants could help some people and it could be a lot more effective than cannabis but I wanted to make my point about the system being potentially OK in some ways but terribly under-resourced and conservative.",

    "selftext": "HI all,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have ADHD, and was really struggling at work and personally, which lead me to seek diagnosis a year or so ago. My Gp originally said that diagnosis on the NHS would be at least 18 months away, and could be up to 2 years away. I therefore went private, received a positive diagnosis and began titration with a registered local psychiatrist. I am stable on meds now, and after some considerable expense, need my GP to take over prescribing. However, my GP now tells me that unless I obtained diagnosis via the NHS, I am not eligible to receive prescriptions via the NHS. This flatly contradicts their previous ascertions. I  can't believe they would require me to wait 2 years, and waste resources diagnosing me with something that has already been dealt with. I also can't accept that I will need to pay for meds and prescriptions for 2 years because of this.\n\nI am being stonewalled by my GP who insists that their word is law.\n\nWhat rights of appeal do I have here?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for any help",

I live with multiple chronic illnesses including having gone through Cancer at 31.\n\nI am sharing my experiences and little things that have helped me get through this horrendous illness. One of those things is looking at the positives of mental health.\n\nIt's very hard to look at the positives of something that knocks us down every single day and just won't give us a break but there is positives.

A manager whom I got along with confirmed that the promotion was given was for two reasons:\n\nThe first was to make the transfer quicker and make the bully more likely to accept it without further drama.\n\nThe second is that the retail industry enjoys bullying superiors for their short term effect of increasing worker output through fear. Bottom level staff usually burn out and leave rather than complain, and there are plenty more people where that came from.\n\nThis person has returned again recently, and now I have to work alongside them, a person who was promoted for their behaviour whilst I was left with a severe anxiety disorder.\n\nI can't leave my job, employment where I life is scarce, nor do I believe I should have to leave. My only solace is that now I am a contractor so they can only interact with me so much.\n\nI witnessed many colleagues quit their job because of these events, some with health issues as a result.\n\nThe cherry on the cake is that the retail company now has posters everywhere for mental health promotion and reporting bullying, and yet still nothing is ever done.\n\nIm probably just screaming into the void, but I guess I needed to.

    "selftext": "So a quick background; I have been struggling with depression for a long while now, it started in my teens as a quiet whisper, little bits of self-doubt, not believing I was enough for my at-the-time girlfriend, but over over the years and into my adult life it has become a deafening scream.\n\nA little over a year ago I went onto antidepressants after a self-harming incident and my family had realised that I needed help. I was put onto 15mg Mirtazapine and they did help at first, but over time it is starting to feel like my low-moods and irritability had come back in force.\n\nAfter mentioning this to my nurse, she did put me on stronger tablets. They helped more, and I actually felt like a person again for the first time in years. Unfortunately I also struggle with a cardiovascular condition, nothing too serious but on the stronger tablets I would start getting pretty bad pains from time to time. After discussing it with my nurse I was put back on the weaker tablets that feel like they don't help anymore.\n\nMy current life-situation isn't much better either. I'm stuck in a town and every time I've said I wanted to leave people have justified living here because \"its cheap\" (funnily enough, I hear that mostly from people who've *only* lived here). The place is a dump with nothing to do with the rare exception of a small indie band nobody's heard of playing a gig at the community centre. There's no jobs here in my industry and it feels like I've applied for every other retail, call-centre or office job and gotten no response. I had a remote job for a while but due to a mix-up with prescription I ended up going without for a while, despite explaining the situation to my boss who said he \"understood mental health\" he kept pushing this idea that I \"couldn't do the work\" and cut my contract. Right now I'm on benefits and I am grateful the govt. is giving me enough to survive, but it doesn't seem possible to save enough to *leave* this place when I can barely cover the bare necessities of rent, bills and food.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't know what to do anymore. Every day my mental health slips, every day I apply for jobs I never hear back from, every day I feel more and more worthless. I wake up, I survive another day, I sleep. I wake up, I survive another day, I sleep. It doesn't feel like a nightmare or hell, its just a never-ending purgatory that I can't escape. I don't know how long I can keep going in this cycle before I attempt something illegal or harmful just to make an escape.",

    "selftext": "Hi\n\nI was bullied a few years ago by a work colleague. It was sorted at the time and I no longer work with that person, however it knocked my confidence out from under me and I have a really bad case of imposter syndrome, I constantly feel like I’m a fuck up (apologies for the language) and I don’t deserve to be here, or I’m constantly worried that I’m going to mess up. Understandably this is affecting my work and it was noticed by management. \n\nShortly before the pandemic, I sought help for my mental health problems and was diagnosed with anxiety and put on a course of CBT. I made my employees aware of that and they were fine, my problems at work were addressed and I was told I would be getting monthly one to ones with management to address any problems that came up. \n\nYesterday was just shy of a year on from this. I was called into a meeting. They asked me how I was doing and I explained that as it had been a year since my last meeting and I hadn’t heard anything, that I was ok, right? \n\nNo.\n\nI was presented with 2 A4 pages of problems that had come up in the past year, all relating to my anxiety, my lack of confidence, that kind of thing. I was told I was a health and safety risk, among other things. I had also had a few incidents where I believed my colleagues were criticising my work behind my backs and talking about me but I put that down to my own paranoia but that turned out to be absolutely true because it was on that paper. \n\nMy employers said they want to help me but I’m really upset that I have had to wait an entire year for this to arise when I know of other colleagues (who have now left) had been getting one to one meetings for unrelated problems. \n\nRight now I feel like I don’t belong here and none of my colleagues really care about me and they are just trying to force me to quit and I don’t know what to do. I’m sitting in the work toilets typing this out and crying. I know I can self certificate for 7 days so I’m thinking of doing that but I have another meeting today (yesterday’s one was cut short because I had a panic attack) and I don’t think it would look good if I did that. \n\nI don’t really know what to do.\n\nAs I side note my self referred CBT ended in December and my therapist didn’t notice any real change but said there wasn’t anything else the NHS can offer so I was discharged.

I’ll be honest, Easter isn’t like Christmas, but it’s still a holiday that people celebrate. So, to think that there are people out there who don’t get to celebrate with their family and friends, it’s not a nice feeling.

Usually, I am awake until 3/4/5 o’clock in the morning (UK time), talking to people all over the world and doing my best to ensure that they go to sleep a happier person.

    "selftext": "Good morning, folks :) \n\nSomething positive I wanted to post as I feel as though I've finally had a breakthrough. \n\nI've struggled with complex PTSD for the majority of my life (32F), stemming from an abusive and neglectful childhood and from deployments overseas. Along with this I was last year diagnosed with ASD - 1 (high functioning autism), which explains a *LOT* of things in my life.\n\nI spent two months in a private psychiatric facility in Germany at the end of 2023 following a complete breakdown and loss of control/full derealisation. I've since returned to the UK and ended up suicidal a few months ago because I couldn't take it all anymore.\n\nI self referred to the crisis team and they've been a massive help, especially following the ongoing treatment by the home intensive treatment team. \n\nThe Psychiatrist has placed me on Pregabalin, beginning at 75mg once in the am and once in the pm. Since increased to 150mg for both times.\n\nI'm finally able to do things without crippling fear of a breakdown. I do still get overwhelmed but Holy hell is it a breath of fresh air to not immediately feel as though I'll pass out when leaving the apartment. \n\nI'm currently enjoying a cheap spoons breakfast and not at all feeling bothered by the other patrons, music, hustle and bustle of this environment. \n\nTruly this medication has saved my life.\n\nNow to continue making the small steps towards some level of recovery.\n\nI'm honestly overjoyed and needed to share this.\n\nFor those of you out there struggling; please keep fighting the good fight and don't give up. If my dumb ass can do it, you all definitely can!\n\nPeace and love to all x",

    "selftext": "Earlier this week I had the tv on as background noise whilst I was doing house errands, what I didn’t anticipate was to see the most atrocious and sickening clip of institutional abuse. It’s been playing on repeat in my head for days now, I can’t shake it off, I can’t stop thinking about it. \n\nFor me the most hurtful, gut wrenching feeling or experience was when I was scolded and punished for something I had no control over. It was a further kick in the teeth when people fabricated what I did, or blamed me for things I didn’t do. I had no voice, i couldn’t defend myself and had no one to defend me. It was emotionally excruciating when i faced repercussions when i lashed out after a wave of torment, while those who hurt me got away. I don’t know how the person in crisis felt when being violently manhandled by those who had the duty of protecting this person from themselves. But what I saw was that the person’s trauma was knowingly used to escalate distress and a defensive response to justify criminal gross malpractice. \n\nThe level of disdain projected at people with mental illness by those who should be helping them is beyond discombobulating. And the mounting number of documentaries exposing how endemic mistreatment towards people with mental illness across social  and health institutions is beyond shocking. Though exposé’s are important in bringing change, I worry that the continued inaction and lack of public response, these documentaries are simply becoming a feed for morbid curiosity, rather than a tool to encourage reform.\n\nUndoubtedly there are people and services that provide exceptional care and support. I sincerely hope that in the future, malpractice would be an anomaly rather than a possibility. Mental illness isn’t a choice, like any physical illness, access to adequate and compassionate care should be an expected standard.",

    "selftext": "TW Suicidal ideation / Hospital   \n\n\nBackground: I'm 35NB and have been told by my previous (NHS) therapist that I probably have cPTSD but I don't have a formal diagnosis so my medical records show is a depression diagnosis from when I was 15. I had to stop seeing this therapist due to moving, so I wasn't able to have EMDR or anything to help with my flashbacks. I'm also an unpaid carer for my autistic brother. Currently struggling with the amount of responsibility I'm shouldering on top of my own mental health problems. I haven't been prescribed any medication but don't particularly want any because in my 20 years of experience it's not been very helpful.\n\nI went to A&E on Monday because I felt suicidal enough that I would have made an attempt. The triage nurse was really kind and sympathetic towards me and told me I'd done the right thing by coming in, but when I spoke to the two mental health people (idk what their actual job title is, sorry) they were pretty unkind towards me. The person leading the conversation was an older woman and kept giving me solutions to my problems as if autism is a one-size-fits-all thing, which was frustrating but I quietly listened and didn't argue. Then she started telling me that I need to stand up for myself and set boundaries. I started crying because the person I need to set boundaries with can become aggressive (not physically, just yelling abuse) if I try and this is something I have always struggled with anyway due to growing up with abusive parents. She starts talking even louder over my sobbing, clearly annoyed that I'm not listening to her advice and this triggers an emotional flashback. I cover my ears to try and block out the woman \"telling me off\", I'm starting to feel unsafe. The more I'm crying, the louder she gets which just makes it worse so then I start SCREAMING because at this point, I'm terrified. She angrily tells me that she will terminate the session if I keep screaming, to which I say \"yes please\" so that she will leave me alone and not continue to torment me. I'm left alone in the room to cry and I can hear them talking to the security officers outside. I managed to calm myself a little and after a few minutes the other lady came in and finished the session, basically just giving me the numbers for helplines I'd already called. Then I was allowed to leave. So I got nothing out of that I didn't already have except for the lesson that I will never go to the hospital for help with my mental health again.  \n\n\nI'd already self referred for therapy - now that's been declined because of my high risk of suicide. I understand that I need to be stable for therapy so I'm not angry about that, but there's NOTHING else. Just this one email that essentially tells me \"stop feeling suicidal\" but no guidance on HOW to stop feeling suicidal. If I knew how and had the resources to make myself feel better, do you not think I would just do that? I also think it's kind of hilarious that they'll only let me refer again after 3 months when the waiting list is always around 18 months anyway. What do they expect you to do in this situation? I'm so frustrated and lost.",

Does the connectedness simply guilt them into living in pain rather than escaping it?\n\nIt seems that so much goes into preventing suicide (which is understandable, because there's no way back from suicide) but if somebody is in chronic pain, we need to make them better. My experience of health services and culture in society is that as long as they can keep you from dying (because of suffering pain), they are happy. Keeping you from living without suffering pain is really an afterthought.",

Paranoid; I have a fixed belief that I have really bad halitosis. \n\nI have a bad taste in my mouth and it’s been confirmed I have gingivitis but upon going to a dentist I was told I don’t smell. Which seems contradictory. I’ve been to countless GPS, dentists, and been assessed by a psychiatrist and seen a few therapists. \n\nThis belief has caused me to act out, I get hostile in public, easily enraged and feel people are staring at me and mocking me; avoiding me etc etc.\n\nAll of the above caused me to stay indoors; it’s caused dysfunction in a lot of areas of my life. \n\nI’d like an adult relationship with a female too. As I’m lonely. I also have no mates. I talk to girls; I go on apps. I can appear confident but underneath have rock bottom self belief. I dunno what to do.\n\nRecently I spent £700 on OnlyFans in one night which is very very sad indeed. I don’t have a history of doing this (don’t watch porn much); coincidentally it coincided with me coming off my Duloxetine. I’ve been having issues getting my prescribed dosage on the NHS and chemists seemed to have an issue ordering it and I ran out. \n\nCMHT also didn’t update my Gp so I had to keep taking in a paper script which frustrated chemists. \n\nAs a result I’ve not slept much, stressed, and doing silly things.\n\nI’m finding it hard not to totally give up on my life.

It's been invaluable, but sometimes UK specific questions get a little lost or end up being answered by Americans. Our medication, assessments, and waiting times are obviously a completely different story. I've messaged the mods on there hoping they'll help. Thankfully the Admin on here is letting me post this and is putting it in the sidebar.\n\nSo I'm hopeful and confident I can set up a little community for specific UK ADHD information and pin some posts that include a lot of information about Right to Choose, pathways, charities, etc.\n\nIn the next week I will set it up, find some moderators, and hopefully start growing it. It's a massive problem in the UK right now. I'm looking for help with moderation so maybe drop me a message if you think you could help in that regard - but for now you might just want to join if you have ADHD/are going through the process/think you have ADHD.\n\nThanks to the Admin of this place for letting me post this.",

    "selftext": "Hi all, not sure if this post is allowed as it's mental health related, but also crosses over to career/jobs too. \n\nI suffered a mental breakdown recently, and fallout from that has caused me to lose my closest friend which has left me in further severe depression and under heavy emotional trauma. I've started seeing a therapist and have been seeking help, but my current condition and mental state is making it very difficult for me to get through a day in my job. I work in retail, and having to deal with colleagues and interact with the public while trying to manage my depression and emotions is putting a further strain on my mental health, as well as causing anxiety each morning over having to get though the day.\n\nI think I need to try and find a job where I can be left to work alone, and a job that requires either no, or very minimal, interaction with others. Even if this means I have to take a financial hit by going part time and low pay for a while, I think it will be better for my mental health which is what I need to prioritise right now. Hopefully this change would be short term and after a while I could then look to move back into something else again.\n\nThe problem I've had though is searching \"jobs for people with depression/people who want to work alone\", I just get lists which have been written by someone who's clearly not given a thought to reality! I just get results of 'start your own company', 'be a park ranger in the wilderness', 'become a lighthouse keep' etc. All would be good sure, but let's face it niche jobs with few openings, that are also limited by location, just aren't realistic for most. Likewise 'start your own business/freelance' isn't something most people can pull off, you need startup funds, business knowledge, a niche product/service, trade skills, and so much more. And even then you could be the best at what you do, but that doesn't mean you'll actually get clients/gigs (especially not straight away).\n\nSo I'm really looking for realistic suggestions for options. So far the nearest I could think of would be as a courier for someone like Hermes, as I gather you set your days/hours, and most of the time your pretty much on your own with minimal contact with people. Similarly something like Deliveroo, although I'm in a small town so not sure there's demand here. I know both of those are low pay and apparently aren't great to work for in terms of holiday, sick pay etc. But right now I think for me just being on my own and not having to deal with anyone else while I'm at work would help my mental health a bit (or at least not make it worse while at work). Plus I'm hoping it'd only be a temporary switch, and that in time things will get back to normal, at which point I could find something else work wise.\n\nThanks in advance.",

For me, it negates and lowers what you are saying.\n\nmy father was a total narcissist who had gaslighting and alternative narratives down to a tee.\n\nwhen I was in my 30s I had my first experience of CBT and I started to capture conversations with him almost word for word as I would go to my laptop and type them up straight away.  Because I could type at 80wpm I could get down the whole convo quickly whilst it was still in my head.\n\nthis meant that I had a word for word transcription of the convo which he would dispute and say that’s not what happened.\n\nusing today’s terminology I should be saying that by relaying what happened and my transcripts of the convos I was telling my truth but that feels bad to me.  It makes it sound as though ‘his’ truth or version was just as valid but his version were gaslighting lies.  There is only one truth.  We make have different narratives around it but surely the truth is the truth.\n\nThats why I find the ‘my truth’ really uncomfortable because it is saying that there are different versions Of the truth.\n\nso, what are your thoughts?",

What can I do to increase the chance of her getting help and support?\n\nMore details:\n\nShe has been acting erratically for about 2-3 years now, with various worrying episodes, sometimes just obsessive behaviour and sometimes quite intense outbursts - I frequently hear disturbing sounds coming from her apartment, she's got two young children now, I frequently hear her shouting, violently throwing things around her place, with children often crying (she never takes the kids out for walks, her window blinds are always shut), she leaves neighbours desperately sounding cryptic notes that don't make much sense, etc. - I have no idea if she's suffering from hallucinations or is schizophrenic or maybe can't take some medication for some reason, but I'm worried about her and about her kids. \n\n(Local council is a joke and at this time myself and other neighbours have given up on them addressing this.

One child (about 1 year old), in a pram carry seat, was placed in one car and she was placed in another car, carrying the other kid (about 2 years old). She didn't resist, didn't have handcuffs on or anything like that, which I was relieved to see, I think cops talked her into checking in and getting some help. This was the biggest police presence on site I've seen, usually just 2 cops, and the longest I've seen them engage with her - some previous times they did what to my untrained eye looked like very rushed literally 5 minutes visits. I'm happy to see the authorities take over this, as I was really worried about the whole situation.",

I took some steps to safeguard myself for the weekend as I've been somewhat out of control.\n\nTurns out, updated contact details were not passed along, meaning CMHT had tried and failed to contact me.

I'm on the 4th floor anyway.\n\nSunday morning comes and I'm woken up to a Police officer knocking on my bedroom door.

For instance, the CBT for Eating Disorders mentioned in the document takes about 40 weeks.\n\nThere are a couple of concerns I do have. There isn't much room for counselling which is an error, especially those patients that aren't in a place to do something intensive like DBT or schema. Several of the therapies mentioned are quite hard to train in. There is a risk for the cheaper generic options being opted for (SCM or KUF for EUPD, Guided self help in Eating disorders).

    "selftext": "In my work as a hypnotherapist most of my clients are mature adults experiencing issues rooted in anger, anxiety, depression - or a mixture of these. Often, they are wondering if their present issues are linked to their childhood experiences. More often than not, the answer is yes. \n\nResearch carried out since the end of the last century has led to a greater understanding of how adverse childhood experiences impact on long term wellbeing – both physical and psychological. The key findings are:\n\n· Childhood trauma is very common: even in so-called well-to-do areas.\n\n· There is a direct link between childhood trauma and chronic disease in adulthood.\n\n· The more types of trauma a child experiences, the greater the risk of them of experiencing social and emotional problems as adults.\n\n· Those who experience childhood trauma often experience more than one type of trauma.\n\nYou can calculate your own ACEs score by responding to the following questions. Give yourself 1 point for each question where you experienced that category of trauma before your eighteenth birthday. \n\n1. Emotional abuse: Did a parent or other adult often or very often insult, demean, belittle, humiliate, verbally assault, or threaten to physically assault You? \n\n2. Physical abuse: Did a parent or other adult often or very often grab, slap, push, or hit You? \n\n3. Sexual abuse: Did a parent, adult, or someone at least five years older than you ever touch your body in a sexual way or attempt or have oral, anal, or vaginal intercourse with You? \n\n4. Emotional neglect: Did You often or very often feel that no one in your family loved you or thought you were important; or your family did not look out for each other, feel close to each other, and support each other? \n\n5. Physical neglect: Did You often not have enough to eat, had to wear dirty clothes, had no one to attend to your medical and dental needs, or had no one to protect you? \n\n6. Loss of parent: Were your parents separated or divorced, or did you lose a parent for any reason? \n\n7. Domestic violence: Did You often or very often witness or hear violence between your parents or other adults where someone was being grabbed, shoved, slapped, hit, kicked, had something thrown a them, sexually attacked, or threatened with a weapon? \n\n8. Family member with addiction: Did You live with anyone who was a problem drinker or alcoholic, who used illicit drugs, or who was addicted to any other substances? \n\n9. Family member with depression/mental illness: Did you live with anyone who was depressed or mentally ill, attempted or committed self-harm and/or suicide, or hospitalized for mental illness? \n\n10. Family member incarcerated: Did you live with anyone who went to prison? \n\nACES Score (0-10) = \n\nAs ACE scores increase, so does the risk of disease, social and emotional problems. With an ACE score of four or more, things start getting serious. While studies in different locations return slightly different results, the figures suggest around 11% of the population have experienced four or more adverse childhood experiences.  \n\nFortunately, brains and lives are somewhat plastic. Resilience research shows that the appropriate integration of resilience factors — such as asking for help, developing trusting relationships, forming a positive attitude, listening to feelings — can help people improve their lives. Research in to post traumatic growth has identified five broad areas of growth:\n\n· greater appreciation of life, \n\n· closer relationships with others, \n\n· increased personal strength, \n\n· new possibilities in life, and \n\n· spiritual “development\n\nWhich correlate very closely with the dimensions of wellbeing psychology:\n\n· Positive emotions\n\n· Positive engagement\n\n· Positive relationships\n\n· Positive meaning\n\n· Positive accomplishments\n\n· Positive health",

When he does come back he'll be rubbing his nose and sniffing an incredible amount. His demeanour/personality changes from one where he gives support to one where he needs support. An example from our last session: When he switched the camera back on I was talking about a friend whose dad has dementia. I was hoping to get suggestions on how best to support said friend. But he asked me about the time a different friend stole alot of money from me, something we've already discussed previously. When asking he repeated himself frequently, e.g. \"Sands, can-you-can-you talk about the time your friend stole the-the-money-the-money from you. That that must've been such a such a betrayal such a betrayal\" Normally he doesn't talk like that at all. He's normally much more focussed, but he came over all hazy. He became upset about what had happened to me and frequently questioned \"Why are people like that. How could someone betray you like that. Such a horrible thing to happen. How did you keep going after that?\"\n\nHe's doing Cocaine while the camera is off isn't he? Any suggestions on what I should do? I don't feel comfortable undergoing psychotherapy from someone who is on drugs in general, and I'm certainly not going to continue therapy with someone whose problem is so bad that they disappear mid-session to do drugs and is high when they come back on camera. Should I just ditch him? Confront him? Report him to UKCP?\n\nEdit: A few people have said, based on how his demeanour changes, that they think he's doing something other than Cocaine. Someone mentioned Ketamine as a possibility, but I have zero experience with how people behave on it so I can't be sure. Still it is a possibility.\n\nI think I'll try recording him during next session so I have evidence to show UKCP. Just got to figure out how.",

    "selftext": "This is I guess partly a vent and partly an \"I need support\" post. I'm really sorry for making you all deal with me anyway.\n\nThe last several days (really the last two weeks, but particularly the last five or so days) have just been unimaginably difficult. I've been stuck in constant thought-loops, nearly 24/7, about how much I hate myself and how disgusting I am. I'm on the edge of breaking down crying nearly all the time. I've barely been lucid to be honest with you.\n\n I've dealt with pretty bad bouts of depression before, but nothing like this -- I had no idea it was possible to feel like this. I can barely sleep, I wake up and instantly, relentlessly, my mind starts bludgeoning me about how much I hate myself, how much I deserve to feel like this, how pathetic and broken I am as a human being, how if I were anything like a real man, I'd just man-the-fuck-up and get over it. How I will never be, and don't deserve to be, loved. It's all-consuming, it's eaten away at me until there's nothing left but a fire-filled pit where my humanity should be that alternately burns and sears until I'm begging it to stop, at which point it goes away only to be replaced by such a fucking dehumanising, agonising *emptiness* that the only thing I can do is crawl up into a ball and sob. I feel so tired all the time, right down to the bone, that it's nearly impossible to stay awake for more than a couple of hours at a time.\n\n I'm not even remotely a religious person, but I feel like prostrating myself and begging to any and every god, divinity, entity or higher being ever conceived to just fucking give me some respite, to give me my soul back from the thing that's stolen it away from me. \n\nI've only been up for an hour and a half and I've already broken down crying three fucking times, and am currently doing so a fourth time as I'm writing this. I just don't know what to do, I'm genuinely not sure if I'm going to be here in a week's time (I certainly don't feel like I want to be) and I feel like everything has fallen apart, and then those broken parts have themselves fallen apart. I feel like my soul has been put through a shredder then burnt to ash. I've never felt anything like this and at this point I just want it to stop -- it's beyond torture. I posted [this] )  on an alt-account yesterday, some of you may have seen it (sorry if you did; it's pretty OTT). It's basically a self-hate letter I wrote to myself which explains some of what I'm feeling I suppose.\n\nI wish I could just have a hug but, unfortunately, there's no one around to give me one. I don't know what to do and I'm asking for help because I'm at rock-bottom and I feel so trapped and alone.\n\nTo anyone who reads this -- please know that I'm sending you my genuine and heartfelt love and thoughts for whatever has brought you to this subreddit. Don't know if that means anything to any of you, but I truly mean it.\n\nSorry if this violates the spamming rule, having made a post yesterday on another account. And sorry for the flowery, over-dramatic language as well -- it's kinda how I express these things.",

    "selftext": "Just left my therapy session, side note therapy is going so well, I'm doing trauma focused CBT with the NHS and it's been so useful for me and I feel like I get on well with my therapist :)\n\n**Another sidenote: if you think you're my therapist after you read this post please pretend you never saw my reddit account. This never happened okay.**  \n\n\nIn todays session I had one of those lightbulb moments and I realised that often when I call the crisis number I feel underestimated and even challenged to act on my thoughts. From discussing I think it's because they haven't taken the time to validate my feelings and understand how/why I'm in so much distress instead they've rushed into what things I should be doing or should have already done to combat my feelings. Like thanks for telling me I should have met up with friends yesterday, that's so helpful for me rn.  \n\n\nMy therapist suggested we look at my risk summary (which I guess is similar to a crisis plan but it's what the crisis team read when I call up) and that we adjust it so that they can know how to better help me, and not unintentionally cause me to harm myself. And I think we did a good job.  \n\n\nHowever the first line I read will stick with me. \"What can I do to manage on a day-to-day basis?\"  \n\n\n\\[**TW\\] self harm (if you want, skip to the last paragraph or stop reading here)**  \n\n\nIt was along the lines of >!\"do superficial cuts that need minimal medical care\"!<I don't know who put that in my summary or why. Last time I did that was in January but my view of self harm is I have always wanted to just stop, cold turkey. I've never thought \"i'll just self harm less dangerously\", my more serious self harm was always accidental. I don't really know how to clearly explain but basically for me that would not be helpful (it might be helpful for others but not me) and I have never expressed what they wrote in my notes. My therapist also didn't seem comfortable with that note and we decided to remove it immediately.  \n\n\nOverall it was really interesting seeing what mental health workers had written about me. I can understand why, once when I called, I was told I should have hung out with friends the day before, because all they had to go off for one bracket was \"meeting friends...structure...walking\". Plus, I'm really glad I got to work with my therapist to make it more accurate and hopefully more helpful, both for me and for whoever talks to me in the future. I think this will have a positive impact. (Lastly, shout out to virtual therapy and screen sharing lol)",

I haven’t seen or spoken to anyone outside my household and the jobcentre since February 2020, I don’t know how to speak to people. I’ve forgotten all the social skills that I learnt in 2019, I don’t think I’ll even be able to make it to the interview and if I do I will 100% have a panic attack. I’m scared to tell the job centre this in case they threaten to sanction for not doing my commitments. \n\nI have a suicide kit that has been downside of my bed since October 2019, I haven’t touched it since but I’m very close to getting it back out. Apart of me doesn’t want to hence why I’m writing here but a bigger part of me knows nothing will get better for me. Seeing everyone so excited for things to open back up and have the summer of their lives is making me feel even lower because I know I’m going to miss out on it due to having no friends, and I really don’t want to. I want to go out and have the time of my life like everyone else will be. People are making plans and have something to look forward to again and I still have nothing. Once the world goes back to normal my life will stay the same. People will tell me to chat to people on here but it just not the same as an in real life connection, \nI just want to feel loved and connected again something I haven’t felt in years. \n\nI have nothing and nobody and I never will again. I don’t know what I want out of writing here, part of me kind of hopes someone I know will somehow realise it’s me and reach out to me? I don’t know. But I think this is genuinely it for me unless something big happens to change that or someone in my real life decided to check on me (very unlikely no one has every checked on me). I nearly tweeted a cry for help on my real account that I haven’t used for years because all my old friends are on there so that someone would reach out but that would just be attention seeking. I’m tired of feeling this way, I’m tired of lying to myself that things will get better, im tired of being so alone, I’m just delaying the inevitable.",

    "title": "My mental health experience. Can anyone else relate?",
    "selftext": "\nWarning: TDLR & mature content\n\nThis is my (22M) first time posting here, and I just wanted to share my mental health over the past 5-6 years. It also involves my experience with religious beliefs which eventually influenced my departure from religion. I haven't shared it with anyone I know till now due to the lack of support and gaslighting I was a victim of when I struggled with depression, (as well as the treatment I'm likely to get because of my family's and church's religious dogma). I had no one to open up to and became rather paranoid about people not taking me seriously. So I learned to just... ignore it and try and live with it. It became the new 'normal' for me. But what exactly am I talking about? Let me explain:\n\n6 years ago, in summer 2014 (I was 16), I started having issues with controlling my own thoughts-one thought in particular, to be specific. I imagined what it would be like to breathe while constantly being aware of my inhaling and exhaling. It began as an silly and fleeting joke but I immediately realised what I had gotten myself into. I had problems actually exhaling while noticing myself about to do it because I was struggling to drive that initial thought of no control out of my head. It sounds really bizarre I know...but it became a real issue for me. The more I struggled to exhale and relax, the more the experience cemented that initial thought into my memory and the harder it became to forget it. So it was essentially a cycle I got real stuck in.\n\nAs you might imagine, it eventually became visible to others and my mum noticed that I was constantly taking deep breaths, which got her very concerned (the deep breaths were my attempts to relax when exhaling). She asked why I was constantly doing it and I told her. My family are extremely religious (we're fundamentalist Christians but I've become a closet agnostic atheist) and back then we tended to rely more on prayers than seeking medical advice when we should have. My parents prayed but despite all their efforts, nothing changed. \n\nIt got to the extent that there was no period when I could actually relax. I was always out of breath because of constantly having to exhale deeply. I remember it got so bad that one night I was actually struggling to breathe and I was terrified. I tried my hardest to get myself to relax and breathe out but it only got worse and I became even more afraid. After what felt like a good while I was able to finally calm down and fall asleep.\n\nHowever, this strange experience occurred again and this led to one of the most bizarre experiences of my entire life. I was struggling to exhale and relax like before and it looked like the what happened that night was going to repeat itself and then...I felt something change. Like an actual physical changing of my brain. It's very difficult to describe and it was so strange. I had no idea what was going on at that moment and when it seemed like I was ok again, everything felt... different.\n\nThe first thing I noticed was that I was cold. I didn't notice this at all beforehand and neither did I feel cold enough to notice until then. And it wasn't just in that moment either, I was feeling perpetually cold even in school. \n\nThen more strange stuff started happening. I realised after some days that I couldn't use my inner monologue anymore. Perhaps I thought it was just something minor at the time, but later I realized it was a serious issue. Whenever I tried (and still try) to talk in my head I can't hear anything like I used to be able to. This has made reading, self monologue and expression of thoughts and emotions a real struggle for me as I have, and still do, frequently resort to self talk (narrating my thoughts out loud) in order to process my thoughts and feelings. This is especially the case when I'm in an emotional state (when I'm very angry, sad, hurt, happy, surprised etc.)\n\nThe next thing that I can remember was affected was my ability to read. I literally could not make sense of words on the page. I tried to read like I usually do but I just...couldn't. Reading anything suddenly became so hard and it really affected my studies at the time. I've had to teach myself how to read since then.\n\nThe most difficult experience to explain was the fact that I had to basically relearn very basic motor function tasks like walking, sitting down, etc. Like reading, it was like I couldn't do it like I used to. The best example of this is actually praying and to a lesser extent, talking. Because of how we were taught in Church, we have a very...different way of praying than most Christians. It's not just a single reciting of a prayer line; we say a certain prayer line repeatedly and we say it with zeal/passion and continue this process for as long as we deem the prayer point (what we're praying about) to be important enough to be prayed about (Very weird I know, it's a Nigerian thing 🤷🏾‍♂️). \n\nBecause I only knew how to pray that way and now found doing so physically impossible (like I literally couldn't say the words) I'd feel very guilty for not being able to pray for long, as I thought God wouldn't answer my prayers. Part of me felt God would understand my situation but the guilt was overwhelming.  \n\n\nOne of the biggest changes however, was my complete lack of interest in anything I previously found enjoyable. Up till then I was really getting into football (referred to as soccer in the US) and was also into Anime and gaming but once that strange Incident occured, no matter how much I tried to get into any of my interests, I felt no excitement or happiness at all. \n\nThe other two biggest things were extreme levels of guilt and anxiety seriously hampering my mental state. I didn't know why but I felt so much guilt for the most insignificant of things (for example, wanting to spend less time than usual brushing my teeth because I found the task too demanding. \n\nAnxiety I felt especially in school, I didn't have many regular friends and no close friends (partly due to me being socially awkward but mainly because of my religious upbringing and emphasis on not keeping relationships with 'unbelievers' superficial for fear of them 'negatively influencing' you), but even those I sometimes hung out with I suddenly became too nervous to talk to them and definitely too nervous to talk to anyone I didn't know already. It caused me to completely withdraw from everyone I knew outside of the family.\n\n\nI know it feels like all these things were big warning signs that something was VERY wrong with me, and that I should have gone to see a therapist or psychiatrist ASAP, but at the time all this was happening all at once and it was just too much for me to process. Because these problems arose during my final year of secondary school, each day became so much harder and it felt like I couldn't slow down to just think about what was happening to me upstairs. \n\nMy deeply religious upbringing and my lack of knowledge regarding mental health/illness didn't help. Due to my family being fundamentalist Christians, I believed I must have done something very wrong, and committed sin to deserve the barrage of issues that just suddenly popped up in my life. The fact that I failed in the responsibilities that I was taught was expected of me by God (praying regularly, reading and studying the Bible, preaching to others about the gospel, and staying away from anything 'sinful' like pmo (pornography, masturbation, orgasm) due to all the mental problems I was wrestling with, served to fuel and reinforce the guilt I felt everyday. \n\nI talked to my mother on two occasions about seeing the GP to explain my experience during my final year in secondary school. Bizarrely, her reply was no. She said it was best that I wait until I finish my Leaving Certificate (the equivalent of A-Level exams which are the high school exams you do prior to leaving secondary school) to deal with it. Now, I think the fact that I was seriously unable to express what I was going through partly led to her lack of urgency towards the issue. Had I been able to pass it across more accurately, perhaps things would've been different. It was a similar situation with my father. I wasn't as close to him and he wasn't as available my mother was on a daily basis. \n\nBecause I had no one that could understand me, I felt very isolated dealing with all this baggage of mental and emotional problems. The build up of stress from these issues caused me to rely on devoting myself even more to living 'right' as I learned from my fundamentalist Christian upbringing. To me, the only way of solving these problems was to confess my sins to God and correct my 'sinful ways'. \n\nAbout halfway through the academic year a seemingly minor incident drove me to make this decision. I was wrongly accused of looking at pornography on my phone and was openly rebuked by my parents in front of my siblings and was made by them to fast till 5pm for 3 days as a way of ' 'showing God I was really sorry and getting rid of the evil spirits that had entered me' (This was essentially why they made me did it). As you can imagine, this sparked very intense feelings of guilt and shame in me and I repeatedly expressed the injustice I felt to God in prayer. \n\nThis was why I finally decided to ask for forgiveness and I was thoroughly relieved when I found myself able to just drop pmo entirely and suddenly live the way God wanted me to, despite not deriving any happiness in living this way at all (mainly due to my depression). It was what led me to believe that God had forgiven me and was now helping me to live 'right'. I was, to the best of my ability, praying and reading the Bible regularly, and staying away from 'sinful' things. Nothing about my mental health had changed but I felt that surely now, God would step in and clear out all these inexplicable problems. I had also stopped masturbating; all these changes lasted for a couple of weeks and I felt more relieved than happy about my life and health despite having a miserable experience in dealing with my mental health.\n\nI really felt God was speaking to me and reassuring me that he'd vindicate me, as I still wanted him to long after the punishment was past. But not long after my newfound hope, I had started to relapse back into pornography & masturbation. The newfound hope that I had, was gone and was replaced by a lingering feeling of fear that all my hard work in trying to be a better Christian and get better mentally, was being undone. And no matter how hard I tried I couldn't stop it. \n\nMy stress levels got worse with the increasing workload of study that I had to do, coupled with my poor mental health, which only exacerbated my porn & masturbation habits, and this in turn worsened my guilt as well as my anxiety and fear of losing God and being left alone to tackle my mental health problems.\n\nI remember feeling so guilty after masturbating yet again that I made the very difficult decision of telling my parents. I usually never do this because I always criticised myself for masturbating and beat myself up over it. Having them add their extreme reaction to it and subsequent harsh criticism only ever served to make me feel even worse about myself and put me in a continuous state of self loathing. \n\nI took the bold step of admitting to my mother out of strong guilt that I did it, expecting her to be more understanding and less harsh on me, because I was being honest, only to be unpleasantly surprised by her reaction. Her face dropped and she didn't at all hide the look of disappointment but instead went to tell my father, which was the last thing I wanted. \n\nI was beaten with a belt by my dad and desperately trying to tell him that I genuinely wanted to stop doing it but was accused of lying because apparently the 'holy spirit was telling him so'. That has since deterred me from opening up to them about anything to do with masturbation or pornography. \n\nFrom then, no matter how much I confessed and asked for forgiveness for 'sinning' against God, or  asked for grace to live 'right', I couldn't stop doing it. The weight of guilt was so hard to bear that I think I ended up convincing myself that the holy spirit knew I was being genuine in my efforts to stop, and would be understanding and tolerant of my addiction, and fully clung to that belief. \n\nThis all changed on one particular evening after doing it and telling myself that excuse once again, all of a sudden I just realised how ridiculous it sounded. I was baffled at how I could believe such a thing and how I'd come to believe it in the first place. Intense fear gripped me immediately I realized the gravity of what I'd done. The fear of the holy spirit leaving me, of God leaving me to suffer at the hands of my problems and the devil. I immediately started asking for mercy, for the holy spirit to come back and help me, for grace to overcome the 'temptation' to do it, the way I was able to but nothing changed.\n\nThat was the scariest thing for me back then, to be left alone to handle my problems. I kept trying to convince myself that God would answer me when I'd try and pray again, but after many failed attempts it finally dawned on me that God wasn't answering my prayers for some inexplicable reason. I was still in denial about this being possible, because I knew I genuinely wanted to change but couldn't pray a lengthy prayer due to my struggles with praying. I also knew the bible contradicted this explanation (God not answering prayer of forgiveness, see John 6:37). \n\nBut it was the only valid explanation I could think of at the time and boy was it a scary thing to come to terms with. I didn't know what to do or who to tell about my experience as I didn't have any close Christian friends my age in church (virtually all youth boys apart from myself in my church weren't considered 'born again' so I couldn't make a close friend in church) or at school and my previous experience with opening up to anything 'sin' related to my parents deterred me from ever doing so again. \n\nThroughout the summer my mental health grew worse but my dad insisted that nothing was wrong with me and that I go to Uni despite me telling him I wasn't ready mentally to take such a step. My mental health grew worse as I started Uni in the UK and the fact that I was too underdeveloped socially and emotionally for life outside the family really didn't help (I had never ever spent time away from the family at all before moving to the UK to study). My anxiety also got worse which made me even more socially awkward and I struggled to fit in and make friends with any classmates or flatmates. \n\nMy depression reached its peak when I began spending more and more time in my room due to my crippling anxiety. Some of those symptoms that I said I was experiencing at the start of this post grew worse, mainly my apathy and anxiety. Fast forward about 7 months to September 2016 and after being close to attempting suicide, gaslighting and bad advice from family on dealing with my depression, and getting kicked off my course, deciding not to get adequate treatment because of my mother wanting to be with me during therapy sessions (which I didn't want but also didn't want unnecessary drama if I spoke out) my parents still insisted that I go to Uni the following year, which I did.\n\n\nIn 4 years since then, a lot of these issues that I described at the start of this post have still been present, including my masturbation and pornography habit, I still don't have my inner monologue and everything still feels... different despite no longer suffering from depression. Happiness, sadness, excitement, these emotions don't feel familiar in the way I expected them to. It all still feels unfamiliar. \n\nIt's only until after overcoming some delusions about life suddenly getting better without me putting any effort in, that I realised I could get help at the University with my mental health which I am currently doing. These symptoms though, are things I haven't spoken to anyone about as I've only recently realised I need to tell someone about them. \n\nI understand my experiences are specific to my situations but if there's any similarity you see between mine and yours with mental health, please let me know. I haven't been able to make sense of some of them for far too long. Sorry if there's any typos, I just wanted to get this posted ASAP and not postpone it any further. If you have any questions at all feel free to ask.\n\n\nThanks for reading",

Any feedback is welcome as always 🙂\n\nSome of the latest rule clarifications can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthUK/comments/ng2crk/many_thanks_to_those_who_commented_on_the_bad/) to understand the reasoning behind some of them if interested.\n\n\n**1. Be kind** \n\nNobody here is expected to agree on all the same issues and discussion with either similar or differing opinions is encouraged but there is nothing beneficial that can be gained from personal attacks and discrimination against things which are beyond someone's control. \n\nThis sub is intended to be inclusive and welcoming to as many people as possible regardless of their race, sex, gender, sexuality, ability/disability etc. No slurs are allowed here.\n\n\n\n**2. I may remove content that I deem to be rude, unnecessary and/or unproductive** \n\nI do not take removing content lightly and will only do so if it breaks the rules of the sub or is very likely to break them e.g an unnecessary provocative comment which may lead to discrimination or an argument which may be harmful for people to read. If someone tries to help and it's not useful, everyone will benefit much more if you simply ignore it rather than insulting them. \n\nIf you see or experience any harrassment or discrimination here then do message me directly for a quick response.\n\n\n\n**3. You're welcome to promote as long as it is related to mental health, research or therapy** \n\nFundraisers can be promoted but only on behalf of mental health charities.\n\nResearch can be promoted on behalf of somewhere such as a University or charity.\n\nBusiness ventures can currently be promoted if related to mental health, research or therapy - just make sure to use the 'small business' post flair but please message for approval before posting so that suitability can be assessed.\n\nPeople from other countries can post or promote here if their content is also relevant and/or helpful to those in the UK.\n\n**4. No content suggesting people should take illegal drugs (linking research related to illegal drugs is fine)** \n\nAlthough using illegal drugs may work for some people who use this sub, it is not always appropriate for certain people with certain mental health conditions.\n\nDo not attempt to facilitate illegal transactions through this sub as this may lead to an outright ban.\n\n\n\n**5. No promoting, glamourising or advocating for self harm, including posting definitive suicide plans** \n\nThis includes pictures of fresh self harm, pro-ana content, encouraging suicide etc. \n\nPlease do not post any definitive plans of how/when you intend to attempt suicide as this can also negatively impact on the mental health of other users here. If you intend to commit suicide and have a definitive plan, please contact 999 or make sure you can get to A&E to be assessed.\n\n\n\n**6. No misinformation**\n\nThis includes: Stigma towards any particular diagnosis, harmful non fact-based advice in risky areas such as in the management of psychotic symptoms, harmful generalisations about groups of people or their perceived intentions including mental health professionals, and speculating around someone's diagnosis/non-diagnosis unless they are specifically asking about that or post strongly indicates openness to that (though preferably to make clear you are not able to diagnose them even if qualified)\n\n\n\n**7. No promoting conspiracy theories or promoting the discussion of conspiracy theories**\n\nSome people here may be able to handle discussion around these topics but this is a broad sub and there are people here who can be harmed by the promotion of conspiracy theories, which includes ones around the topic of Covid-19.\n\n\n\n**8. No promoting pornographic material** \n\nThis sub is open to people who are under 18 and therefore it is not appropriate to share anything explicitly sexual here. You are welcome to talk about the sexual side effects of medications or sexual topics strictly in relation to mental health though.\n\nResearchers are welcome to make a post searching for participants in relation to this topic. \n\nPlease tag your post as NSFW if it is sexual in nature.\n\n\n**9. Please try to avoid blanket terms/language** \n\nUsing these terms can make people feel excluded and unwelcome, as well as lead to unnecessary harm. Please ensure you're speaking of your own personal experiences and not on behalf of others.\n\nThere are both 'service users' and mental health care professionals here, and it's important that all feel welcome to share their views if appropriate. If you have a complaint about something/someone, do try to acknowledge that it doesn't necessarily represent everyone who shares a commonality with them.\n\n\n\n**10. No spamming** \n\nSpamming will be addressed if someone spams here specifically but not if it's just a single post that has been shared on various other subreddits. If you're a researcher and wanting to repost then feel free to do that after at least a week has passed.\n\nIf you're posting a blog post or YouTube video from your personal channel/blog then please limit the frequency of these particular posts to a maximum of 2 posts a day, but ideally a post every few days (or longer) is a preferable frequency. \n\n\n**11. Sharing personal information is not recommended here. Only share via PM at your own discretion** \n\nSometimes I may ask people who post here about their age and region that they're in so that I can offer more accurate support/advice but you do not have to share any information you feel uncomfortable with sharing. Be very careful about sharing information which may identify you and if someone here is pressuring you to share personal information then do make sure to block them and report it to me and/or Reddit.\n\n\n\n**12. Quote news articles or blogs as truthfully as possible if you decide to editorialise** \n\nI will sometimes post editorialised titles in order to portray the story of an article as honestly as possible from the angle of adding clarity - particularly in relation to justice e.g stories relating to inquests or bad CQC ratings exposure. I also do this to give credit where it's due as well. I will never re-word phrases or add ones which aren't actually included in the article. Do not harrass any named persons in any articles.\n\nIf you choose to post an article and editorialise the title, just make sure that anything in the title is actually truthful and included in the article.\n\n\n\n**13. Political comments should be relevant, able to be backed up and not low-effort**\n\nPlease ensure comments are not low effort political insults or assigning unproven intentions - comments that are sharing of reasonable concerns, campaigns/petitions, are informative and preferably with a source.\n\nPolitical discussion and warranted government criticism will not be banned as mental health and politics are very intertwined but as this is a broad sub, it is preferred that political comments are not made unnecessarily/low effort as not everyone here will hold the same political views.",

    "selftext": "I've been seeing a doctor and psychiatrist for an undiagnosed mental illness for a few months.   I am also living with my parents because I was pulled out of my home due to said mental illness.   My mother is EXTREMELY overbearing, overprotective and constantly thinks she's entitled to know about every minute detail happening in my life, because \"I'm your mother\".  When I was younger she manged to barge her way into all my mental health appointments.  Because I was under 18 nobody did anything about this.   Because of covid I can only get phone/zoom appointments and so far my mother has listened in to almost all of them, apart from when she was at work.  \n\nMy appointment with the psychiatrist was over zoom despite the fact I asked for it to be in person because privacy isn't a thing for me right now.  My mother, needless to say, listened in to every word.   And yes, I probably should have told her to go away or whatever but I didn't realise she was listening in to my appointment until halfway through, I wasn't about to get up midway to tell her to go away and she just wouldn't have done a thing I said anyway.   I had to type in anything she wouldn't have approved of -  I get manic episodes and when that happens I do a lot of dangerous impulsive things like drugs, spending money I don't have, having unprotected sex, etc etc.    None of that I felt comfortable with sharing when my mother was listening in.    Also the entire time my psychiatrist spoke down on me as if I was incapable of thinking for myself, and just asked if my family knew about my problems the entire time.   I did tell him my mum was listening in but he shrugged it off as if it wasn't an issue.  \n\nThen my psychiatrist insisted on talking with me and my mum at my next appointment.   I didn't want to say no because my mum was literally right there.   I don't know why that was even brought up considering I thought this kind of thing was meant to be kept confidential from family members unless I'm a serious risk to myself and others - which I'm not.  I'm also 22 years old and I'm pretty sure your parents can't legally get involved if you're over 18.   I'm incredibly stressed about my mum finding out information I want kept private.   \n\nIs there any way I can report this?  I'm in Scotland btw.",

I reckon if there was focus on mindfulness it could help students who are at a disadvantage perform better. Please could you sign this. [mindfulness petition ](http://chng.it/H7jyx9fZ)",

I was feeling good for the first day in a couple weeks, but now because of the last two minutes of the call I'm feeling dejected and worried they'll just fob me off.\n\nAm I just going to have to identify every issue myself, the same as in the screening?

    "selftext": "I recently shared a post with my local Andys Man Club that got a lot of love and I thought I'd share it here. It's about my personal experience but also draws parallels with a recent high profile news story. \n\nBackground - I've been going to AMC for two years now. I've made lots of friends, something I'd struggled with since leaving my home city in search of work 20 years ago. Through AMC I've also started playing  football againafter 10 years and we now have a regular football game which has been a roaring success. CWB in the post below is the name of our football group. I got fitter than I've been in a long long time thro gh football and it kick started more exercise at home and at the gym. Physically I'm as well as I've been since early adulthood. \n\nSo AMC has been a huge part of my life and has had a positive impact on pretty much all aspects of my life. I'm sharing this in the hope it inspires more men to get down to their local club. I could write a book with all the success stories from just my local group. I'm happy to answer any questions or provide more information on what to expect. Here is what I posted:\n\nI don't know if any of you have been following the post office scandal but there's an interesting parallel with us. Not obvious but let me explain. Their story began with a bunch of individual struggles. They were told repeatedly the were the only ones suffering. They were on their own. We've all been in that same situation. On our own trying to make sense and deal with our problems. We've told ourselves that we're on our own. That no one would care or understand and this was a personal battle we had to fight. In those circumstances it's a lost cause. The post masters didn't think they could take on a giant like the post office. Some did but lost. Our personal battles often ended in defeat. But then something changed in the post office scandal. The post masters found each other and formed a community. Now the message was different. You're not on your own and you'll never have to fight alone again. And that's just like us. Whether it be AMC or CWB we've all come together to form something life changing. A community based on an unforgettable truth...we're no longer alone. We are now part of something bigger and we never have to feel like we have to battle on regardless. The values of our group are huge. Support, respect, understanding, compassion. All the things we forget to apply to ourselves when we feel alone and in the midst of a storm. So this is a reminder of what you've all come together to create, how amazing it is and how fortunate we are. And most of all never forget...you're not alone.",

The help I’ve received my GP could have provided AND a CPN frankly bullied me. Childhood sexual abuse discussions were invalidated, I was laughed at and told o have nothing to offer a woman when I said I was dejected after been on dating apps.

I dunno what the truth is anymore!\n\nI have emailed a complaint to the trust because I’m fed up.\n\nI’m meant to be getting help from social services to get out as I’m isolated/no friends but even then I’ve had to chase it up; gaps in when I hear back from them. I have no hope at all!\n\nAdd to this, I received a letter today about council tax arrears from 2019! I owe a former council £881 and it’s taken them 3 yrs to send a letter telling me. It’s from when I lived with an ex and she wasn’t paying the tax and hiding letters; I thought she was handling it. She wasn’t so ended up been thousands but it’s somehow got down to £881. I’ve been in and out of work due to MH. I receive £275 universal credit and they want £100 a month off me.\n\nThis has enraged me and tipped me over the edge because I resent my ex for this.

Im a 32 year old guy, married, with a 4 year old son and 1 year old daughter. \n\nMy son started school this week, he has been out of nursery about 8 weeks and I have been working from home. He knew a big change was coming and has been having bigger and bigger emotions. My wife and I agreed we would change our strategy with him, not try to settle his emotions and just provide him with comfort and safety until he processes them. I have been finding it hard to empathise and have been consistently too quick to anger with him. Now he's started school he's exhausted and his emotions are still all over the place and I try to be comforting and gentle but am still generally too quick to anger and shouting. \n\nMy daughter is a sweetheart, the cutest smiliest baby that there is, but in return she gets surrounded by shouting, I don't communicate with her well and she is just in the crossfire between my son and I all the time.\n\nMy wife has just started a business. She is out 3 days a week. On Wednesday her mum has our daughter, on Friday I have her, on Saturday I have both of them. We are in a bad place; starting the business put a lot of pressure on both of us and adding in looking after the kids has driven a huge wedge between us. I feel like she doesn't have any affection for me and she says she doesn't like to show it because she doesn't want to.be responsible for my happiness. She doesn't feel like a safe space for me anymore. \n\nThen there's me. I started a new job 18 months ago as a team leader with a mission to turn a team around. I have a vision of what I want to do and things are starting to change. Then 2 weeks ago the leadership team decided to restructure and I am at risk of being made redundant, along with all of my team. Whether I keep my job or not the mission I started with doesn't exist anymore and I am grieving that. I am not too worried about getting a new job, but am really sad about the mission. I feel like people just keep telling me it will be ok and to keep searching for something new, like I can't talk to my wife because I don't want to drag her down, and like I have nobody else to speak to.\n\nEvery time I argue with my son or don't give my daughter enough attention I think about how much better off they'd be without me. Every time my wife and I just go to bed without a kiss or touch or real conversation I think about how much happier she could be with somebody else. This is so hard to write... I think about doing something drastic a few times a day, not with any actionable plan or intention but just how much easier it would be, and how the people around me would be better off. I don't want to be this huge weight anymore that brings people down, fills my family with conflict and ruins everything. I want to feel light and happy again and see the good in things but I don't know how",

    "selftext": "Hey people!\n\nI thought I would post my experience as I think it would be massively beneficial for people suffering from any type of anxiety especially health anxiety. Be prepared this is a long post. Please, please read as I honestly believe if I had a post like this to read it would of helped me.\n\nBefore I start I am a 38 year old male from England. I am 5ft 11ins and weigh around 88kg. I live a healthy and active lifestyle and exercise 3 - 4 times a week. Previous to this experience I had never suffered from any major illness or had any previous mental health issues. I have always been very relaxed and laid back.\n\nSo in October last year I had a weird cough for a couple of days. When I coughed I felt a slight strain just below my Adam’s apple. I had a feel of my neck and I noticed a small soft lump the size of almond on the lower left side and inflammation in the centre of my neck directly above my collar bone. \n\nI made an appointment with my GP and upon my visit he stated he’d like to take some blood tests and have me booked in for an ultrasound. He reassured me that he thought everything would be fine as I’m relatively healthy and only in my 30’s. \n\nAfter that appointment I did the worst and started to Google my symptom’s and went down an endless rabbit hole of possibly diagnosis. All the while constantly touching and prodding my neck every chance I got. Everything I read pointed to Thyroid cancer and for 2-3 weeks straight until I had my blood test and received my results I wasn’t getting more that 2 hours sleep a night as I was constantly worrying. Around this time I started to notice my vision blurring and my eyes twitching.\n\nThe bloods came back all clear, liver and kidney function all good and no inflammation. FBC also good.\n\nThis was good news however, I still had to wait another month for my ultrasound. I have a family so my worry escalated. Still no sleep, constantly touching my neck and in that time I had two panic attacks resulting in two trips to the hospital (where they done multiple blood tests on both occasions) and more visits to my GP asking questions for reassurance. \n\nI was finding any bumps and lumps I could over my body, usually smaller than a pea convincing myself these were inflamed lymph nodes. I was finding them in my neck, groin and under my armpits. In these areas I started to have sharp pains. Again I had more GP appointments asking them to examine my lymph nodes. From October to December I had visited the GP 13 times. Every time telling me I was just being anxious.\n\nThe results of my ultrasound came back which showed I had a goiter, two slightly enlarged nodules in my thyroid gland but with no signs of anything ominous. \n\nAlthough good news the way I was feeling I couldn’t accept that I was in good health. \n\nBecause of the lymph nodes I could feel I had read up on lymphoma and honestly thought I had it or another type of cancer. \n\nI was constantly taking my own temperature, getting short of breath, checking my own blood pressure. \n\nI was told by my GP this was all because I was worrying too much and had anxiety. I couldn’t accept it, why was worrying making me have all these physical symptoms?  -\n\nPains\nLoose stools\nHigh temperatures\nHigh heart rate\nShortness of breath\nBlurred vision\nTwitchy eyes\nDizzy spells\nFatigued \n\nThe doctor prescribe me 50mg of Sertraline. The first or two weeks of taking Sertraline made every worse. All symptoms increased. \n\nI also had multiple ultrasound scans on my lymph nodes for reassurance. Again all came back fine.\n\nA few weeks later I went on holiday to an all inclusive resort, free food and booze which I took advantage of. Turned out mixing my Sertraline with alcohol was not the best idea as I started having diarrhoea on a daily basis, usually two to three times a day. Again, I thought this was a result of me having a serious illness and not mixing the meds with booze.\n\nWhen I returned home I made yet another appointment with my GP. The downfall with the NHS is that you never get the same GP, so who ever you see needs to familiarise themselves with all your medical history to date before or on the appointment. \n\nI told this GP what I had been experiencing over the course of the 4-5 months and the symptoms I had. Straight off the bat she said,  and I quote “it sounds like HIV, you should have a test, and while we’re at it we’ll test for diabetes and do another FBC”.\n\nSo I’ve been with my wife for 16 years, married for 12 years and had my son in 2018. I new during her pregnancy she was tested for HIV as standard procedure which came back negative. I have always been faithful and trust my wife completely. Although I knew it was highly unlikely I had HIV, once again I googled the symptoms. Not a good idea. I then convinced myself I had not just HIV but full blown aids. This sounds incredibly stupid but this is where I was at. \n\nThe symptoms I didn’t have on the AIDS list I started having, everything but rashes and legions. I even lost my sight in low light on occasion. The 2 weeks it took to get my bloods taken and the results back were the worst I had ever experienced in my life. No sleep, constantly worrying, breaking down in tears daily and checking glands every moment I could. Reading up on Google and Reddit about people living with HIV and AIDS.\n\nAgain it may seems extreme and ridiculous but this is where I was at. To my suprise yet again all bloods came back all clear. I broke down in relief. \n\nIt was at that point I decided to increase my Sertraline dosage to 100mg and seek help for my anxiety through the NHS using the well-being centre. \n\nThe mental health unit done an assessment on me at the end on January this year and decided it would be beneficial for me to have six to eight session of CBT. As this was through the NHS there was a four week waiting list for me to start my therapy. \n\nFour weeks? I couldn’t wait that long and I didn’t really want to pay private prices for CBT.\n\nI decided to take matters into my own hands for mine and my families sake.\n\nIt was a tough road but I started working out again, acting positive, reassuring myself nothing was wrong and I stopped checking my body for lumps and bumps. \n\nIt wasn’t until someone I met at work explained what anxiety was to me and the physical effects it can have on the body when I really did start feeling better. \n\nThey put it to me like this -\n\nEvery one get worries in life. The more you worry the more that worry turns into stress. That constant stress and worry then takes its toll on your mind and on your body, leading to physical body changes. Psycho-somatic symptoms, especially in health anxiety. \n\nNow the NHS had been superb, seeing me countless times, sending me for many tests, some at my request. Their downfall is having no real knowledge or explaining to patients thoroughly what anxiety is and what it can do.\n\nThe term “anxious” is thrown around to casually on a day to day basis, people have something important to do for work they’re “anxious” people have money problems they’re “anxious” people have an interview they’re “anxious”. I feel the word “anxious” is used in a way that just casually indicates that someone is worrying about something no matter how small. Where as real anxiety is crippling and can have a powerful effect on your mind and body. \n\nAgain no GP or doctor explained to me what an anxiety disorder entailed. Just every time I went to the GP they said “you’re anxious”.  \n\nThe other major flaw is the NHS’s mental health and well-being service. I was on a four week waiting list to be treated for chronic health anxiety with CBT. That was at the end of January, I wasn’t contacted by a therapist until late May (four months after my initial assessment), at which point they done another assessment and stated I didn’t need any CBT as I had self treated myself and am now in recovery. Ridiculous! Absolutely distrusting!\n\nObviously I thought my situation was bad, the worst, it may seem like an exaggeration but I really thought I was going to die. But think about the people who have it soooo much worse, people who on top of anxiety slump into depression. People with no support of friends of family, or people with anxiety who find it hard to talk to people. The NHS well-being and mental health service need to step up and take action! \n\nAnyway, for all of you who are suffering  and do need help I’m here to talk, any questions please feel free to message me and I’ll get back to you asap.\n\nAll the best and keep strong and positive. You matter, your life matters and no matter what type or whatever level of anxiety your are suffering you are just as important as the rest. We are equals!\n\nThanks for reading…\n\nRob",

    "selftext": "[First post](https://old.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthUK/comments/ss9hlj/i_suspect_my_psychotherapist_is_doing_cocaine/).\n\n[First update](https://old.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthUK/comments/szgq2o/update_to_i_suspect_my_psychotherapist_is_doing/).\n\nHi all, a second update on the ongoing saga of the possibly drug-taking Psychotherapist. Today's session started roughly 40 minutes late. This follows on from last weeks session which started about 20 minutes late. I've recorded both and I've read the UKCP (UK Council of Psychotherapy) complaints procedure and I doubt I'll be able to get anywhere with them. This is due to the 'realistic prospect' test which basically states is there a 'realistic prospect' of proving the allegations? Unfortunately I think the answer is no. I only have a record of the last two sessions, and not the session that sparked off my suspicions. Furthermore, how am I supposed to prove whether or not he's on drugs? I can't force him to do a drug test and neither can the UKCP.\n\nI'm not even sure if I'm not just being needlessly paranoid. Am I seeing what I think I'm seeing or am I just connecting meaningless dots into something more than is really there?\n\nEither way I'm going to stop seeing this Psychotherapist. Either he's doing drugs, in which case I need to stop seeing him, or I'm paranoidly suspecting him of something he's completely innocent of. Neither is a position on which to build a therapeutic relationship. The fact that he was 20 minutes late to the last session and 40 minutes late to this latest session plus his behaviour during the sessions (i.e. eating, drinking, repeatedly moving about) is just more reason to stop seeing him.\n\nI wish I had better news for you all.\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the comments. I think I'll make a complaint to the UKCP on the basis of his tardiness and behaviour in session (i.e. the eating, drinking, and constant movement), rather than my suspicions of drug use.",

The new care coordinator is triggering and compounding even the locality manager is very uncaring. Also he never checks in with me which my previous coordinator always did. I only spoke to them once when in a crisis. I wish I hadn’t! Also, me and my family could see there was something off about him. I’ve tried complaining and asked for a new coordinator but I’m sure nothing will be changed. I’m not sure if I’m automatically being discriminated against because of my BPD diagnosis  I also have a complex trauma diagnosis. Yet I’m not convinced I have both but I’m sure I have complex trauma. I’m not getting any treatment just on a waiting list so the locality team is all I have so therefore I’m on my own completely. Would be great to hear if anyone else has similar or advice to change my coordinator. After five years on a waiting list - with no actual treatment - just advice like have a cup of tea and stigmatising label after no proper assessment just a judgement from a chat with therapist - I’m very close to coming out of NHS for good as it’s making me feel worse. I’m better away from them. But can’t go private so that means I’ll just have to try by myself.",

After much back and forth, being declined some counselling services and only offered the basic talking therapy, having to endure a long wait for an autism assessment that came back with a \"not our problem, get him to a psychiatrist tho\", I had the referral sent off by my GP.\n\nToday, after a month of waiting, I've just had it. I'm tired of waiting.  Tired of coming home after my morning's work and seeing no new post.  All I want is a confirmation, that something is happening.  I don't know what the referral will entail, and it's adding to my stress (not that anything takes that much to stress me out anyway).\n\nIt's wearing me down.  I know my mental health is going downhill, I'm trying my best to keep positive, even if only for the sake of my wife.\n\nI know the answer will be to continue waiting, and in the meantime I've tried to help others, responding to posts and replying in support groups, but even that wears me down.  I get exhausted mentally so quickly these days.  I've got no passion for anything, it just feels like my life is on hold.  It's a void, I don't have any strong desires (well, not even healthy ones), I can't focus on something to occupy my time - I'll sit here for hours deciding on a movie to watch, only to turn it off after ten minutes and start over.  Or play a game, and do the same.  It doesn't matter.  \n\nPart of me dreads seeing the psychiatrist.  What if it's something I have to declare like bipolar?  What if they decide to end up sending my back to the autism assessment team and I end up waiting another two years (I really don't know how far gone I'll be by then)?  Without any progress, and having had to wait for so long, it's just an open-ended question.  Why am I the way I am?  \n\nI understand why in part, but it's been the case I really need a diagnosis.  I fear for the same diagnosis.\n\nAnyway, that's my rant.  \n\nOn a side note, I'd like to thank the mods of this subreddit - I see so much hard work put in to replying to almost every post, I know you've replied to some of mine in the past.

    "selftext": "Hi all. I’m a full time carer for my adult disabled son but I have been struggling with depression and other mental health problems since my early teens. I have on my medical records that I’m an alcoholic from many years ago but I have realised recently that I am not actually addicted to alcohol, I just use it to block out the childhood trauma that I went through as well as the crippling numbness that I feel each day. I don’t really even enjoy drinking, so I will only have maybe one drink in the evening to be sociable and that will be it for the night.\nSince lockdown started back in March we have had any respite and care for our son cut completely. He has only just started going back to college two days per week, so those days are the only ones where I actually get a break from caring for him. I knew that my mental health was going downhill rapidly but I couldn’t get an appointment with my GP until recently. So I started self-harming and not eating. I’m a rather overweight lady, so the not eating is not noticeable at all but the SH is. I made a chemical burn to my hand, which I managed to pass off as an accident but I know that I can’t get away with that again. I have a fair few scars from SH in the past which my husband helped me to stop doing, so I do try to hide what I do from him again as I don’t want to put extra worry on him too as he is struggling too at the moment with his MH.\nMy GP has started my on Sertraline tablets just over a week ago but I know from past experience that they take a couple of weeks before they start taking any effects. I don’t know where this post is really going as I just needed to write it down somewhere. I have deactivated my Facebook account at the moment because of how I feel and posting on here helps. I hate that this whole COVID-19 situation has happened as it would be much easier to go and ask for the correct help otherwise. I don’t know where to start. I know that both the stress of bringing up a disabled child over all of these years hasn’t helped my mental health but I know that there is something far darker back in my childhood that I have repressed the memory of that is causing all of these problems. Antidepressants may be good at masking the problems but they still rear their ugly heads every so often, ready to screw me up again.\nI constantly have suicidal thoughts but will not act upon them as I can’t put my family through that. My GP knows all about this as I have been very honest about this. I just wish that I knew a way of telling other friends without freaking them out.",

Any suggestions? Can be online**\n\nHello, I just wanted to make a post if anyone identifies. I have been waiting now for 10 months for a care coordinator and art therapy. I am with the CMHT and have severe depression, anxiety, PTSD, and take mirtazapine, quetiapine, paroxetine, propanalol, promethazine, at high doses. I struggle so much with intense emotional pain, which for me is incredibly painful lows and resisting the urge to block out my pain with alcohol - one day at a time. Sometimes I think sh would be easier. This month, I have been told again I have to wait for a care coordinator/therapy because someone being discharged from hospital goes ahead of me on the list because of CPA. This is so unfair.\n\nRecently through some phone scrolling, I came across #section, #psychward, #grippysocksvacation on tiktok. I am 40 btw and not the core demographic but I enjoy scrolling in bed when I am feeling very low and sucid\\*l myself (although I do not act on these urges). I just felt so angry that people are glamourising their \\*very privileged\\* stays in wards and on discharge etc. A 'grippy socks holiday' is a way of romanticising the fact that inpatients do not wear shoes on the ward, but many tiktokers are bragging about running in the grippy socks, going missing on the ward for fun by absconding etc.\n\nIf you go to hospital, that's ok, come out of hospital and try to get better. But these tiktokers are actively refusing premium psychological therapy, whilst someone waiting desperately for months for it in the community who doesn't self harm (but still feels as awful, and actually for longer, day in day out rather than 'swings' in mood) is told they are in 'second place' on the waiting list over and over and over again. I wish inpatient service users understood that their inpatient stay affects everyone in the community's waiting list space. Please, if you are offered something that we have waited months for, and you have pipped us to the top of the list, at least try it. We like you continue to struggle but we have to get by without any real treatment (I believe 50% of CMHT patients fall into this category). For context, a 30 min appointment every month/3 months with a healthcare professional is the CMHT norm, with depots etc if you need them\n\nInpatients have had the benefits of hospital/crisis stay, are offered therapy on discharge and refuse it, whilst someone also open to the CMHT who doesn't \\*act\\* on self harm urges (note: that is different to not wanting to sh), gets told to wait, again and again and again until they snap in frustration and hurt themselves. Not what they wanted to do, but they were pushed too far and see others harming themselves and being given priority treatment for it.\n\nSeeing these tiktok videos, there are so many patients later, after an 'episode' of self harm/suicide attempt etc - they are smiling, colouring, doing hair, and being looked after by nurses. So many of us would love to have the opportunity to experience care like you do for an hour a week, with a dedicated 1:1 and chance to offload. Some patients, for reasons I will never know, decline DBT and go back to self harming and su\\*cidal ideation. Why don't we all just engage in maladaptive strategies and forget sitting in the sh\\*t day in day out of horrible lows without the benefit of DBT we so badly need, because it takes us to the top of the queue every time?",

I didn’t do very well at school and college and I can’t do full time college courses now because of mental health issues I’ve been diagnosed with since leaving school (I have chronic anxiety, depression, probably ptsd or CPTSD and autism). I’ve applied for countless jobs over the years but no employee will even think about taking me on for some reason (I’ve had tons of interviews but they never go any further) so that’s why I’m gonna volunteer to get some experience, and hopefully I’ll enjoy it too.\n\nHowever, i also have some paid hobbies that I do (I go to singing lessons once a week which cost £40 a session), and there are some others I’m thinking of taking up too so I can maybe pick myself back up and push myself out of my comfort zone, but im reluctant to do so because its not my money - its the money of taxpayers. So I guess I feel I should apologise to taxpayers out there and maybe ask permission? Also I don’t drive but have been thinking about learning to for a while, but again, am reluctant to do so, for the same reason I just stated. I have Netflix and Disney plus (though thinking of cancelling as hardly ever use it), and iPhone, pay my mum rent every week (as I still live with her), no kids, no tattoos (I know mentioning no tattoos might be a bit pointless to some of you but I’ve seen the tv programmes about people on benefits and some are covered in tattoos so that’s why I mentioned it), do a lot of my own cooking and shopping and my own laundry always, as well as helping out around the house, but I still feel guilty. I used to go horseback riding once a week too, so thinking of going back to that, as when I was there I dreamed of becoming an instructor someday.\n\nThanks for reading, and sorry for the essay.",

(or chase up support from months ago, I've read is a common experience)\n\nI genuinely believe that the only way they get away with it is because the patients in their 'care' are too burnt out or don't have the capacity to put together a complaint and go through the process. I made quite a detailed and specific complaint which took ages to put together and took so much concentration only to get the worse most dismissive and uninterested response from the 'investigation' and I just couldn't find the will to take it further. I'm disappointed in myself for not but at the same time I question if it would have made a difference at all. \n\nI'm not oblivious to the fact that they're underfunded as well as understaffed often and the effect that must have on the places. However, I've found mine to be particularly neglectful and just non existent, to then try to discharge me on the basis I've not showed them a 'level of need'??\n\nI was passed back to them (the lovely vicious cycle and trap that it all feels like) by the crisis team before and they just never got back to me. No call, no follow up, absolutely nothing. So being someone who is quite traumatised and avoidant of people based on the belief that I'll be treat negatively and that it will end in despair, I just left it. For quite a long time. I thought they must have read it and laughed and thought yeah I'll not bother. \n\nI've had to seek a diagnosis elsewhere for my conditions because had I stayed on the NHS pathways under cmht I'd have not only still been waiting for half a century but been denied a diagnosis (which I now luckily have, but have immense survivors guilt around because there's so many people struggling to access assessments in such a problematic system) because they refused to look beyond the mask/assess me using criteria for adults and so many other issues.\n\nI had a call from someone I've only ever spoken to once before today that I've had to ask for about 3 times now. I was told I wasn't on the waiting list for DBT like I'd been told I was being put on over a year ago. No idea why I hadn't been. I said I'd self referred to talking therapies in my area to attempt to get me started on going through difficulties I'm having with PTSD traits/trauma responses (which I'd self referred to *directly* as a result of having no communication, no regular contact and no follow up at all from them, and was told that I'd have to go with them in the meantime, swiftly followed by talk of discharging me because I'm \"too functional in the community\"??? (No elaboration on what this meant, I wish I had asked because he clearly hasn't read my notes or any of the letters sent from the last time I was with talking therapies) And 'things are tight around here and I just don't have that level of need' (based on what again I would love to know, I heavily dissociate often, my ability to cope enought to manage to work has been impacted, I rarely ever go out and if I do I delay things until I can take someone with me who knows my true 'level of need' and the stated I'm capable of getting into when left to my own devices in certain situations/settings. \n\nThe list goes on. \n\nJust heavily neglectful, despair-inducing, impossible to get help from, absolutely no practical preventative measures before I reached crisis point or during or after.\n\nHow are they still being funded? With how bad the complaints are for most of them I don't understand how it hasn't been re-thought and better delegated or just anything to actually help people. No wonder so many of us don't cope enough to make progress or get where we hope to be and people end up trapped/stuck",

    "selftext": "TW: Inference to significant mental health crisis. No other direct triggers \n\n\nSummary of post: My experiences of accessing MH support, barriers I faced in  accessing support over the past 4 years.\n\nA general rule of thumb, is that one shouldn’t spend more than 30 percent of their monthly income on rent. This month I found myself paying 37.5 percent of my income on private therapy. After 6 months of toing and froing between referrals, assessments and appointments I’m back at square one with no foreseeable possibility of receiving support from the NHS. Yet, I am one of lucky ones who can access support privately knowing full well I can lean on my family for financial support if the need arises. \n\nOne can also say that I am lucky because I am “high functioning” and “independent”. A couple years ago you would have found me meticulously typing up essays, with notes and papers strewn across the kitchen table whilst something was boiling over on the hob. It’s likely, that you would be in disbelief if I told you that the day before I was taken to A&E due to a mental health crisis. At the time, on paper I would have  appeared as managing, not quite meeting the criteria to have a referral accepted for more specialist support. Considering that I worked/was in higher education, could take care of myself without family or friends, it was within reason to discharge me back to my gp and request referral to primary mental health support. The issue was and still is, that because of complex needs and level of risk, primary mental health services cannot even place me on a waiting list for any of their services. I get re-referred to more specialist support, to only get discharged again and the cycle repeats.\n\nWhat I believe is the main problem for me around accessing help (if we forget briefly about funding cuts and politics) is that hyper-independence is often overlooked and  perceived as something innately good by health professionals or assessment frameworks. Yes, being independent is good, but reaching a point where you are not asking for help, minimising the severity of an issue, and thinking you’re causing a fuss to a point it places you in a seriously vulnerable and dangerous position, isn’t ok. I think this is something that needs to brought up and explored further in detail in assessments. Not focusing solely on what one would do in crisis, but what would they do if they feel they are in danger or got into some trouble, have a non-medical emergency, have financial troubles,have a reoccurring health problem,etc etc. Does a person feel able to reach out and cope if adversity occurs or could a person deal with possible adversity within a level of reason and safety.  \n\nI still find it perplexing that four years on, I’m still in this conundrum where support is inaccessible to me and have finally decided to stop chasing it up. This shouldn’t be the case, not in modern UK, but me accessing private therapy is a huge privilege that many cannot afford.",

    "selftext": "I (30sM) have symptoms that vary over time but the key themes are lack of energy, low mood, avoidance of activities, loss of enjoyment in previously enjoyable activities, difficulty focusing or unfocusing, distractability, high sensitivity to rejection. These have been on and off since childhood. It has become  harder to cope recently, I believe due to the added responsibilities after becoming a parent. These difficulties greatly affect my ability to attend to household responsibilities, to do my job, and to generally look after myself and my family. \n\nMy symptoms seem mostly associated with depression (either melancholic or atypical) with a few that seem perhaps to hint at ADHD. No specific childhood trauma but one parent was I believe suffering from mostly untreated depression, and in my early twenties I had a prolonged and very upsetting period of distress due to certain religious beliefs I held. \n\nI've tried a lot of things:\n\n* CBT and behavioural activation - fairly helpful but always short-term interventions and I felt I needed sustained help. Some help in rewiring unhelpful patterns of thought but the underlying sadness and lack of energy kept coming back after a while\n* antidepressants - fluoxetine, sertraline (max doses) - potentially helpful it was hard to tell if it was helping. Recently started venlafaxine, waiting to see if this one helps but not getting my hopes up. \n* counselling (1+ years of weekly sessions - at some considerable expense) - helped me feel better at the time but limited lasting impact. Perhaps the counsellor's approach didn't fit me? Perhaps I should try a different kind of counselling? \n* blood/urine tests, ruling out diabetes, coeliac, thyroid, anaemia. More blood tests due soon, not sure which the doctor has booked.\n* Initial assessment for ADHD - I felt many of the symptoms were familiar and sought assessment, but verdict was to keep treating as depression for now\n* diet, exercise, sleep - the usual suggestions, and they do help a bit but not enough, and it's hard to keep them consistent when the symptoms I mentioned make it so hard to. \n\nI feel I'm slipping through the cracks of effective treatment - it feels like doctors have just wanted to try something and see if it works, rather than try to deeply understand the causes underneath. But I suppose that is how brain medicine has to work, until we understand the brain better.\n\nIs there any chance I'm going to find something that actually helps? This has been going on for years and I'm not OK.",

    "title": "My dad can’t cope, my sister controls his whole life - is there any support we can access?",
    "selftext": "\n\n\nSo my 16 year old sister (I’m 18) is severely autistic and disabled. She can’t talk and has a very low mental age and ability. My dad is her full time carer and my mum works.\n\nShe has always been difficult and prone to having meltdowns, however for the past 3 months she has been acting extremely hard. She forces my dad to sit down straight on the bed with her and refuses to leave the room. If my dad stops holding her hand she starts howling and screaming and stamping her feet and hitting herself. She is not attached to my mum at all and cries when she goes near her. She’s ‘scared’ of me as I never put up with her as a child and refused to give into her, she screams when I am near her too. She goes to a specialist school when it’s not summer and holidays bu my even they keep sending her home as she’s too difficult.\n\nShe is controlling and asks my dad every second to keep moving his arm this way and that and sit up straight. He has to do this for 20 hours a day and is not sleeping or eating. He has to take her in the bathroom with him to go toilet as she will scream otherwise and she tries to pull him off the toilet. My dad has to sit in the bedroom holding her hand 24/7. I often wake up every night multiple times to her screaming randomly. Oh I forgot the reason he can’t eat in the room is because she stops him eating by snatching his hand away and then starts having a meltdown. She does the same if he tries to watch anything or have his phone or talk to me. \n\nHe is isolated from me and my mum and my mum has to sleep on the sofa downstairs as my sister is awake all night. Is there anything we can do or you would recommend? I have a feeling my dad is suicidal and I am off to Uni in September\n\nEdit - She is on the waiting list for Both an OT and social worker but hasn’t seen either for years.\n\nMy mum honestly isn’t the best, she has cheated on my dad two times and doesn’t care much about me or my sister. I know I’m over sharing  but this site is anonymous and I think I’m just venting. For myself, my dad really doesn’t want me to help, I have had my own mental issues as I thought I was transgender and took hormones which was a mistake and then before that I got anorexia and nearly died and was in hospital. I’ve finally managed to erase the effects of taking testosterone and can just live like a normal teenage girl as I got voice surgery last month and have had laser hair removal. He just wants me to go to Uni and live a normal life for once. I want to make things easier as he’s the only one in my family who truly cares about me and I love him so much, but I physically can’t look after my sister.\n\nI used the wrong word with ‘scared’, she’s got anxiety about everyone except for my dad, at school she’s ‘scared’ of her teachers. I have never raised a hand or even shouted at her, but just me being in the room makes her upset even though I have lived in the same house as her for 18 years. When I say put up with her I mean I wouldn’t do half the things my dad does and stay in one room 24/7 to stop her crying",

    "selftext": "Some very helpful comments on that thread which I expected may turn pretty chaotic pretty quickly! It is awesome that everyone put their point across in a way that was sincere and without the 'red mist' clouding things, which must be particularly easy for those navigating NHS mental health services or requiring/seeking other mental health services during this past year or so. \n\nUltimately, one of the main aims with growing this sub was to help raise awareness of various levels of inequalities within mental health care (alongside support, resources etc) and by having the type of discussion that was had yesterday, it allowed for everyones view there to be seen and heard.\n\nI've taken some heat for removing comments before but it's always frustrating if anything to have to remove things that I may generally agree with but expressed in ways that aren't compatible with the rules and principles here which are mostly formed by feedback. If I chose to allow certain things *simply* because I (or many) agree with them, that can become quite a slippery slope - so thanks to you all for the great comments, it's seen and appreciated!\n\n\n\n**New rule:** \n\n**13. Politics - Please aim to ensure that political comments/criticisms are not made purely to be provocative and are in reference to a specific relevant policy/post, preferably made if they are/can be backed up with a source.**\n\n**Political discussion and warranted government criticism will not be banned as mental health and politics are very intertwined but as this is a broad sub, it is preferred that political comments/criticisms are not made unnecessarily as not everyone here will hold the same political views.** \n\nThis rule was made because politics can be very divisive which isn't conducive to an atmosphere that can appropriately support mental health and because there are more appropriate subs to discuss politics in a more partisan manner - if there is acceptance of particular negative sentiments (rightly or wrongly) towards one political group, then it will attract those sentiments towards another which will eventually create an atmosphere that is rather counterproductive to the aims of this sub. \n\nAppropriate mental health activism that involves politics is always welcome, such as the [#stopSIM campaign](https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthUK/comments/nd1mcs/stopsim_halt_the_rollout_and_delivery_of_sim_and/) but low-effort or irrelevant political comments that are provocative will likely now be removed when seen.  \n\n\n\n\n\n**New rule ammendments:**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Rule 4 illegal drugs amendment:** \n\n**Do not attempt to facilitate illegal transactions through this sub as this may lead to an outright ban.** \n\nThis amendment was made not only because it is potentially very dangerous and illegal, but also that it breaks rule 7 of the [Reddit Content Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy). \n\n\n\n**Rule 10 spamming amendment:** \n\n**If you're posting a blog post or YouTube video from your personal channel/blog then please limit the frequency of these particular posts to a maximum of 2 posts a day, but ideally a post every few days (or longer) is a preferable frequency.** \n\nThis amendement was made due to it not being clear what was considered spamming here. Posting too much from one channel/blog etc may be off-putting for those who don't wish to join, and those that do can still see your content as much as they like if they choose to follow after seeing a post on here. \n\n\n\n\n**Rule 9 blanket language amendment:** \n\n**Terms such as 'could', 'often' and 'may' are preferable.**\n\nThis amendment is more akin to guidance and was made because it is a lot more difficult for there to be escalations in/to arguments when using terminology that doesn't suggest everyone experiences the exact same thing from the same groups of people etc. It's more factual and harder to argue with 'My experience with NHS mental health services were terrible and feel there are many who may feel the same for many different reasons such as underfunding/postcode lottery/frequent staff turnover etc' vs 'NHS mental health services are shit and so are the staff, none of them care'.\n\nIt is also an aim that this can be a place where mental health professionals or other related professionals who encounter the mental health care system can at least understand the viewpoints of 'service users' and to contribute if they wish/feel able to, so that likewise their viewpoints can be understood too.\n\nBlanket language will be removed if it's particularly harmful but generally likely wont be strictly moderated",

    "selftext": "Hi there.  I put a small post up the other day talking about how somebody had heavily criticized a video on my blog because I was saying that the mental health service in Norfolk is non existent.\n\nWhat hurts is that this was from one of my dearest friends.  Both her (E) and another (L) have always been rather curt with me.  L actually lived with me and my mum who is also my carer for about two years when she was a teenager so she in particular has first hand knowledge of how ill I have been.\n\nTo be honest, not many of what i'd always considered my friends have been very supportive.  When I was a youngster who liked going out and getting pissed with the rest of them it was fine.  In fact if I ever had problems then they were great.  They've called ambulances for me and seen me have breakdowns so they are both very aware of my struggle.\n\nHowever once I quit drinking - the depression after a night out was killing me - and all my friends went in different directions we drifted.  We would try to get together a few times a year for a meal out but without alcohol I found this so difficult and eventually stopped getting together with them.\n\nWhen Facebook came about it was great for me because I could keep in touch and also keep my distance.  After all this time and looking back I have come to realize that both E and L never or hardly ever left me any nice messages or likes etc.  They all seemed to talk to each other fine and I would leave the odd pic or line of speech complementing them as my friends.  But if I ever put something they didn't agree with then they didn't seem to have a problem letting me know. On one occasion I was reduced to tears after they pulled me to pieces for fretting about DLA assessments which I dread.  What was I worrying about?  I was exagerrating surely.\n\nNow for the important part.  Both E and L work in healthcare.  E works in critical care and is very successful and hard working and L works as a psychiatric nurse.\n\nE has always been quite hard really but I just figured what with her job it had made her like that.\n\nAnyway so last year I started a blog about my mental health.  This was mostly written word but the occasional video made it in.\n\nI aimed to be very honest about what I was going through and this included the video I made.\n\nWell last year L unfriended me when I pointed out that there were very few beds to be had in the country.  She told me that suicidal people are not usually mentally ill and anyway what did I need to see a psychiatrist for?\n\nThat really, really upset me and still does.\n\nThen yesterday E messaged me and basically said that although she loved me she was unfriending me as I kept trashing the mental health service.\n\nI told the truth though.\n\nAlso how bloody tactless to be so crass to somebody they know is suffering.\n\nAll my old photographs with them I want to burn.\n\nIt was all a lie.  They never liked meas I really am.",

The problem is I'm kind of out of options, I think. The mental health team want to discharge me because they've put me through CBT, MBT and psychotherapy, and that's all they can offer. I've been on my meds for almost two years, and whilst my anxiety medication seems to be alright (with the occasional dosage increase) I'm at the maximum dose of my antidepressant and it's clearly not as effective as it was. I'm frightened of changing it because I've tried a LOT of meds and have suffered horrendous side effects, especially on duloxetine (dizzy, sick, hot flashes) and Prozac (general apathy and total loss of libido). The loss of a sex drive almost killed my 10 year relationship.\n\n\nI'm usually pretty high functioning, and whilst I'm trying to keep up with things like exercise and healthy meals, it's getting harder and harder to do and I'm crying all the time and generally overwhelmed. My self hatred is at an all time high, which makes no sense because I'm working out and losing weight like I wanted to. I'm getting more dark thoughts about self punishment and suicide, and I'm just exhausted and drowning in it. \n\n\nI don't know where to go next. I don't know whether to ask for a medication change - and risk the side effects - or slog it out and just try not to die. I don't qualify for more therapy, as far as I'm aware, and my CPN seems to be at a loss.  The fact that I'm low on options is only making me feel worse. I suppose I'm asking for advice because right now I don't trust my own opinion enough to make a choice.",

We want to understand what works, what doesn’t, and how we can make Ready Player B the best it can be.\n\nAs a charity, we want you to join us in our fight for better mental health in young people across the UK. As I'm sure everyone is aware it can be really tough growing up, and this past year has been especially difficult. Young people are more lonely, worried, sad and stressed than before lockdown. And for many, gaming is a much-needed escape. A way to combat loneliness, feel connected to a community and get out of their own head, even if just for a little while.  So what better way to fundraise for young people, than by holding your own live stream!\n\nIf you'd like to get involved in testing Ready-Player you can [sign up here](https://www.barnardos.org.uk/ready-player-b).\n\nThank you all so much for taking the time to read this.\n\n[https://www.barnardos.org.uk/ready-player-b](https://www.barnardos.org.uk/ready-player-b)",

If anything, perhaps I could say I am managing better but I wouldn't say I am any better, I would say I've just gotten better at hiding my feelings from my family in order to be able to avoid the confrontations about potential suicidal thoughts or tendencies. I'm still plagued by daily thoughts of self harm, I'm still not sleeping well, I'm still finding meaningless (as described by others) situations debilitating and I still feel like I'm being falsely led. The medication feels like it's making unable to cry, or show downward emotional turmoil and is faking my brain into keeping hold of \"feel good\" chemicals and forcing me to be more \"with it\" than I previously have been.\n\nHonestly, I'm petrified that my GP will note it as an improvement and take me off of the medication, but equally I don't want to take the medication anymore because I feel false. I'm worried that my next CMHS appointment they'll feel the same way as my family and GP and discharge me and ultimately I'm worried that things that put me in the mental state I'm in now will overbear on me and without the medication, family, medical support around me, I'll lose what modicum of self interest I have left, I'll lose the support from government benefits, I'll lose what I care about the most and essentially have nothing to stop me from taking my own life.

It was quite a big surgery (they opened me up like a Christmas roast duck) and it took more than one year before regaining something like a normal life. Like many other patients, I developed severe mental health issues after the stay in the ICU. I tried to get mental healthcare on the NHS, and this is what happened:\n\nReferral with the GP\n\nSeveral weeks later, a talk with a semi-trained MIND counselor. She admitted that she had no clue on what to do. Referred back to the GP.\n\nGP received the referral and referred me to a psychiatrist.\n\nMe to the GP: \"I told you that those idiots from MIND were useless. Why you did not refer to a psych when I told you?\"\n\nGP: \"Huurrr dueeerrrr huuurrrrrrr huuurrrrrrr\"\n\nAfter six months, I finally got an appointment with the CHMT. I spoke for half an hour with a psychiatrist with the typical glazed stare and empty smile of people that took to much benzos.  After half an hour of inane questions, he told me that the therapies they had were designed for people in a much worse state than mine. He told me that maybe he could arrange for some therapy sessions, but then he said the magic words:\n\n\"I can prescribe you some happy pills\"\n\n\"No, thanks, I do not want to become like you\"\n\n\"hehehehehhehehhehehheeeeee\"\n\nThree months later, I received a referral in the mail. They were inviting me to therapy sessions, in the Queen Elizabeth hospital (about 15 miles away, late in the afternoon, no public transportation available). I was forced to refuse, since it was simply impossible for me to reach the place.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJudging by the rants I hear in this subreddit, I was quite lucky compared to the average!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: CHMT, not CAHMS, I am not a teenager.

However, I could not sleep at all (2-3 hours each night) and I felt pretty terrible.\n\nOn the third day (Wednesday), I started to feel really bad. I had some 'bad thoughts' and I hurt myself. The mood swings were terrible and so overwhelming. Again, I couldn't sleep - I ended up crying for 50 minutes straight in the middle of the night at one point which isn't normal for me. On top of that I felt on edge all the time. It was too much to cope.\n\nI took the medication on Thursday and felt terrible all day again, so I decided that I would stop taking it. I made an appointment with my GP on Friday morning where I explained everything and he agreed with me that I should stop.\n\nWe have another appointment on Wednesday where we'll discuss other medication and to be honest I'm scared I'll get bad side effects again. Does anyone know what he's likely to prescribe?\n\nAnd if I get a bad reaction from the new meds, what will happen then? Is it a case of keep trying until we find something that works?

I want to be social and meet people but at the same time I’m embarrassed just to exist as I have to wear incontinence pads and feel like a disgusting burden, especially if a bowel accident happens. While I’m kind of nose blind to my own accidents at this point I really hate bad smells in general and they make me gag terribly so I don’t want to put anyone else through that kind of discomfort.\n\nThere are other silly little things as well, like I have to take a bag of supplies with me everywhere in case I need to change. Most people are too busy with their own stuff to pay attention to if you have a bag or not but when it’s always with you and you take it to the bathroom with you every time I feel like eventually people are going to notice. I’ve offended someone before because they assumed I was passive aggressively implying they were a thief by not leaving my bag at the table.\n\nAlso, on the subject of changing, if it’s just wet I’m able bodied so I can change that in a standard public toilet cubicle (hard to conceal the noise of the tapes but it is what it is), however if it’s more than that I do need the extra space a disabled toilet provides and when I come out if there’s someone waiting there they’ll usually try to shame me for using the disabled toilet because they see a healthy man in his 30s.\n\nI can think of all these reasons not to go outside but I can’t think of any realistic things I could do to change my situation.

    "selftext": "TLDR- Social challenges in uni. First time tackling depression. Better place now. \n\nWhich surprised me to no ends as I was fairly popular and confident in school and expected to fit right into uni life. Perhaps due to societal expectations or media ideologies, the American Pie, “make friends for life”, “best years of your life”, “hook up with so many people” got to my head and I ended up hurting myself by trying to fit into this mould. \n\nI tried to make friends but not being able to form a tight bond with any of the boys and girls in my halls I lived in nor being the centre of attention (as I was in school) in my course made me reevaluate who I am. Felt more of a pariah day by day and found myself spending more and more time by myself. This fed into a loop of self pity. I remember I’d barely put any effort into my first year studies because how inept I felt socially.\n\nI’d still go to lectures and attend group works which there were a lot of in my course but the interactions with my fellow young humans never felt easy or genuine, just civil. Due to all this I’d never really enjoy being in uni halls and would visit home any chance I could get as my school friends were all mostly still there and I got to be around people I was comfortable around again.\n\n\nI thought this experience was just my bad luck at uni and I tried to move on with it. Where I lost myself instead of finding myself. Anyways, years later, grew up, got a job, became a proper adult. When in my mid 20’s I started dating a girl who was in uni at the time. And she had a perfect uni life I’d envisioned, the friends, the parties, the lifelong memories, the ideal life. Which triggered my insecurities of my own time at uni and I pretty much lost the one true love of my life because of what happened to me in uni. \n\nIt’s taken me 10 years from moving into halls to get to a place where now I feel I finally tackled my insecurities and am proud of the person I am. So much so I donated a kidney and in general live a happier life. In hindsight I just wished I was more prepared/educated in all aspects of uni life than unintentionally be so narrow minded and perhaps I would have had an easier experience.",

It must respect the confidentiality and anonymity of others, if not yourself, and be of your own creation. \n\nTo help incentivise involvement I've decided to award £100 to the entry I like best, and £25 to the 3 runners up. It's not a lot but it's all coming out of my own pocket. The plan, albeit limited, is to continue to run this competition for every issue I run as I'd like it to be of decent quality.

I'd like to have all entries by end of June(ish), but if you're reading after that please still get in touch because I'll be planning the issues after!\n\nYou can contact me on here, on @theframefanzine on Twitter and Instagram, or by email at theframefanzine@post.com",

I was on the anxiety course and was not getting support for my depression, I didn't find the modules relevant and I felt I needed more support than a generic message every 2 weeks. \n\nShe asked me about counselling over the phone. I explained that I do not have private space at home that I feel comfortable talking.\n\nShe said this should be enough, got a prescription for antidepressants for me, and told me the referral should take 4 weeks. She didn't want me to not have support for that long though, so she told me to carry on with SilverCloud if I could, and to make another appointment in the meantime. \n\nHer appointments weren't released yet, so the receptionist asked me to call back the next week. I did, her appointments were all booked, I was asked to call back the next week. I did, and got an appointment for 2 weeks later. \n\nShe called me last week to say my referral had been rejected. Apparently because I was still engaging with SilverCloud. I was furious. I was told to write a message on there explaining I was not finding it helpful. I had over a week ago, but did another for greater measure. I also referred myself to Talking Therapies to get a telephone consultation. \n\nI get an appointment for later that week. I get a call, disclose lots of difficult feelings relating to self harm and suicide at her request, and then get told they will close my silvercloud account as I'm not finding it helpful, and will schedule a telephone consultation for a week and a half's time.

I didn't cut that deep often because I was afraid of catching a vein.\n\nAfter years of wearing hoodies all summer, I stopped hiding my scars in public and from everyone but family around this time three years ago. I used to hate the summer, but I enjoy it now, and I like the feel of the sun as much as everyone else does. People very rarely comment, and it's never been negative. I'm thinking of coming out about them to my parents this summer so I'm not constantly hiding them around their house still, constantly making excuses for long sleeves. I think they know anyway and we're simply playing a game of pretending I don't know that they know.\n\nI'm doing better these days, too, well, things came to a head during lockdown, I was forced to get some help for mental health issues, and that's turning out for the best, I think.\n\nI'm embarrassed about my scars for a really weird reason though, that they're not deep enough. I feel like it's obvious to anyone who looks that I didn't really suffer because the cuts weren't that bad, and that the very fact I have them is therefore whiny and pathetic. I've been feeling this way about them for years, and it's really the only thing that bothers me about them. It's obviously a good thing they're shallow, I'm grateful I wasn't in a worse place.\n\nI would like to allay that embarrassment, I guess. I don't know.

    "title": "CW: SEXUAL ABUSE/ RAPE. Found it cathartic writing about past trauma which has and will affect my mental health for the rest of my life. Nowhere to share it so will share here. Hope that's OK.",
    "selftext": "I want to share something that has fundamentally shaped me as a person and affected every aspect of my life since I was 17. I was raped by a 37-year-old man who, a year later, reached out to me through Facebook messenger to say ‘I fucked you over and all I can do is say sorry. I was a drunken fucking idiot’. \n\n\nI hid it from just about everyone for nearly a decade. It will take at least another decade (but realistically the rest of my life) to unpick the damage it has caused me. I was so incredibly ashamed, ashamed of myself and ashamed of what had happened. I felt disgusting. Nearly 11 years on I still have vivid flashbacks that make my skin crawl and make me feel physically sick. I wanted to bury it as deep as I could. What if I hadn’t got drunk? What if I had went home early? What if, what if, what if?\n\n\nWhat if that man made a choice not to rape me? It’s taken me about 10 years to realise that nothing I had done, drank, or chose to wear that night, affected his decision to rape me. He raped me. He made that choice.  The shame is not mine, the shame is his. I have to keep telling myself. The more I tell myself the more I believe it.\n\n\nWithin the past 6 months I’ve started some counselling for the first time and I’m at a point now where I can look at that 17-year-old Kim and want to hug her and hold her and say ‘do not carry this burden alone’. I’m so sad that I did for so long. I used to look back at that Kim with such self-hatred that it isn’t an exaggeration to say I literally hated her. I was, and am, an intelligent person who “should have known better than getting myself in a vulnerable situation”. That’s what my internal voice was saying constantly- “it’s your fault”. I realise now, objectively, that it wasn’t. It’s so hard because although I do recognise that now, overruling that voice in my head is literally exhausting some days.\n\n\nIt’s only now I’m starting to process the event that I’ve realised the sheer trauma I’ve carried (partially buried) since. I don’t trust myself, I blame myself for things going wrong, and most of the time I simply don’t really like myself. That’s the hardest one to stomach cos I really, really, really want to like myself. The chronic lack of self-esteem I have is insidious and seeps into most aspects of my life. I ended up in a couple of bad relationships after the rape, including one where, because I thought so little of myself, I would get called a ‘useless piece of shit’, or variation thereof, daily. After we broke up, he saw me on a night out and text me 50ish times across the night saying he would ‘fight me’ and ‘bury me’ as I was such a ‘dirty slut’. I didn’t bat an eyelid really, I just took it. I internalised it and thought those words were true. He once told me ‘I disgusted him’ and I was like “yep, I disgust myself too”. \n\n\nSome days I want to kick and scream and cry like a toddler WHY DID THIS HAPPEN TO ME? Then I remember bad things happen to people literally all the time: there is nothing remarkable about my trauma. Something goes wrong at work or I can’t reverse park or something equally as trivial and my internal voice chimes in with “ah that’s cos you’re a useless piece of shit Kim! 😊\" I’m getting better at shutting that down but, like I’ve said, it’s SO TIRING. \n\n\nI was reflecting recently about how I would never be afraid to say ‘I got jumped ten years ago and I have ongoing issues because of it’. But something about admitting you were raped seems SO much harder. I kept it secret for so many reasons:\n1. because for so long I didn’t even acknowledge it as rape (because the victim blaming narrative that was particularly strong ten years ago made me think it was my fault)\n2. as an extension of the victim blaming narrative- I was worried people wouldn’t believe me/ would blame me \n3. I didn’t want to upset anyone\n4. I didn’t want to face any awkward conversations\n5. I didn’t want my friends and family to hurt on my behalf\n6. I wanted, and still want, to protect my parents from the pain of knowing this happened to me\n\n\nNow I feel like I want to say something. I try and use my voice to advocate for others in and outside of work but I haven’t used my voice to advocate for me. I feel disingenuous being open about my depression and anxiety without acknowledging a huge contributor to it. I also feel such frustration knowing that I could have gotten help with this so much earlier and, having done so, I probably would have handled it all much better. It has been cathartic for me finally facing up to this and I wish I had been brave enough to reach out for support earlier. There is no real point to me writing this but if one person reads it and it resonates, then maybe they won’t make the mistake I did and leave getting help so late. \n\n\nCovid has given me, and I imagine many others, the chance to think and reflect. As I write this, I have friends around me who are coping with cancer diagnosises in close family, traumatic bereavements, and general life struggles of the late 20s ‘I should have my shit sorted by now!’ mindset. The struggle is real. Sometimes it seems overwhelming just how many of us have major issues and problems to work through. Society judges our worth by our monetary output, or our physical contribution to the capitalistic society we exist in. We are more than this. We are human. We have problems. We have trauma. We have pain. I honestly think the best thing we can do to work through stuff is talk about it. Open up and try to understand what makes us who we are. So I’m opening up. I’m telling you what happened because I would not be the Kim I am right now without it, good or bad.",

    "selftext": "My partner is suicidal. In the last few months and weeks it’s been getting markedly worse. She has attempted many times and every time she's gotten more psychotic and desperate to take her own life, becoming more and more dangerous, determined and frequent with it. In the last two days, she was has been to the hospital twice, both times due to an intentional overdose. Each time she was discharged after being assessed, despite the fact that she poses an immediate risk to herself and requires urgent care. The way the doctors and nurses at A&E and her community me tsk health team treat her is not with dignity or respect in fact they’re clearly showing they’re annoyed with her for trying to kill herself and the things they say is not helpful and it makes her want to act on her impulse to kill herself even more.\n\nI’m not in the UK right now so I can’t call emergency services and had to get someone else to call 999 for me. She is not safe.\n\nI do not believe she is receiving adequate care for this, nor do any of her friends or her. The lack of help she has received even after reaching out or ending up at the hospital with intentional overdoses is very concerning. She and I are not listened to and her concerns are never properly addressed. She clearly may need to be sectioned or given the option to be a voluntary patient at a psychiatric hospital to ensure her safety. She isn’t even receiving talk therapy at the moment, she had a few session with a trainee I believe. She needs more attention from doctors when it comes to the titration and choice of her medications and monitoring of those medications due to her desire to overdose on the medication.\n\nShe has told me multiple times in the past few days that she is going to end her life because she cannot take it anymore and her actions of attempting to overdose have CLEARLY demonstrated this. She is at risk of acting on her suicidal thoughts and plans and she will continue until she physically can’t. During her episodes, she is now willing to deceive me and others in order to achieve her goal of suicide by hiding medications, and trying to overdose on them in secret. This is a new development as before this she was normally willing to cooperate with me and others, but as a result of not receiving adequate care she now thinks there is no hope for her and she cannot bare to live any longer.\n\nI am pretty sure that she meets the criteria for being sectioned and yet she hasn’t been. She met those criteria months and attempts ago. She is also told that being admitted as a voluntary patient is always an option but whenever she asks she does not receive it. She was admitted for a few days at one point and I know that really helped, the main issue was that she wasn’t admitted in York so it was hard to get her clothes and other necessities to her. Me and her friends are incredibly worried for her because she is now clearly willing to go to any lengths to do it now. She has a plan, in fact, multiple, and is very willing to act on them. It is only a matter of time before she succeeds in taking her own life because these past few days she has become increasingly determined, delusional, psychotic and reckless.\n\nDespite this, she is never provided with the care she desperately needs. She feels uncared for and this has only served to worsen her condition. Some of the few appointments she does get given are so subpar that it is actually the appointments that trigger attempts on her life. It’s bad and I’ve seen it with my own eyes. Her requests for help are routinely ignored and the responses are always too late and seem half-assed. I believe that if she was treated properly with respect and dignity she would be willing to receive help. She and I have made it very clear that she is not safe and needs to be hospitalised until she is more stable. Her mental health is so deteriorated and no one I’m calling is actually doing anything despite my warnings.\n\nNot that it’s about me but this is also seriously affecting my mental health and I don’t think I’ve ever felt so hopeless in my life. It's incredibly frustrating. There seem to be a lot of things that the NHS has done that seem and feel just outright like malpractice. Obviously, there is more detail to this than I can go into in an email like this. Prior to the latest episodes, she asked for me to help her with getting her better help. I do worry that she is at a point where she is so desperate to die that she would hypothetically even turn down help now. I just want her to receive the help she requires. It’s a very very serious medical issue, and I wish it were treated as such.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated. I really need help with this. She is not safe and her threats and actions are not being taken seriously. We are in York if that helps.",

    "title": "My story: 17 year old sufferign with depression. struggled with MH for the past six years",
    "selftext": " \n\nHi all,\n\nThis is the second Depression subreddit I have joined. I've decided to speak about my experiences here to see if it can help anyone here or if anyone can help me as I've found some of my posts have no responess.\n\nI'm 17 years old, nearly 18. I'm male. I live in the UK and the past two months have been the toughest in my life. I have been diagnosed with clinical depression, and on medication (will get to that later)\n\nBut my story goes back beyond 2 months, so I will start from there.\n\nIt's not light reading - in terms of content or length. So I hope you have some patience.\n\n**My experience of bullying**\n\nSo I'd say for the entire duration of my adolesence I have struggled in one way or the other. In my first year of secondary school (I'm not sure what grade this is equivelant to in the US and other countries, but the age is 11-12). I'd recently moved to the area. I had a bad feeling about the school from the moment I arrived. My parents however, were keen for me to go. So, I did.\n\nIn the summer of 2014, they had a summer school at this school which I attended. That was when my first experiences of bullying there started. Pretty low level. These two girls, stealing my equipment. But it got worse and I ended up having a day or so off. But I did make some friends.\n\nWhen I started in September that year,I felt alone. I remember texting my mum, as I stood outside in the playground, alone. The \"friends\" I had made, quickly abandoned me. Almost instantly, a campaign of bullying began against me. Firstly, it was just insults and stuff. Low-level stuff, though it did get worse. It was very cliquey - like an american high school or something. Almost everyone bullied me. A lot of them were girls. I started that school with an open mind, perhaps innocent, perhaps naiive. Within weeks, that had all gone. I was hardened. I was bold, I was assertive, something I no longer am. Fights and other acts of violence were almost the norm, happening on a near daily basis. I believed fighting would get me respect, the respect I needed to prove I wasn't gonna take sh\\*t from anyone. So, one December morning, I went out into the playground, demanding one of the main bullies come to fight me. Unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately depending on what way you look at it, one of his lackeys showed up instead. *I wanted the organ grinder, not the monkey!* The main bully in question was supposedly in detention, so I had it off with this kid instead. It wasn't really a proper fight, though I guess you coudl say I \"won\", as I ripped his shirt, and he gave up. Eventually, a fellow student managed to mediate some kind of truce between the two of us.\n\nThe school's policy was not to expel any kids, regardless of how bad they were, something which worked great for them, but worked terribly for the rest of us. The school's strategy for bullying? They basically told me to accept it and put up with it. This was coming from the head of year, a black woman. I said to her \"*If you were getting racist abuse, would you like it if we told you to \"put up with it\"?\" I can't* remember what she sadi to that. anyway, it was decided in the school's infinite wisdom, that i would be moved from one half of the year to the other, so that the bullying would stop. Of course, this didn't happen, as everyone on that side of the year, many of whom used to be my \"friends\" bulied me. Things went from bad to worse. I was physically bullied, but I would retaliate. Something I wish I could have done later. One of the most brutal forms of bullying against me, and I was embarassed to talk about it for years, was when I was lured into an ambush by these girls. They told me this girl liked me, and of course, me being young and innocent, I thought i was going to meet her. I waited outside of the building at lunch, supposedly for this girl to turn up.\n\nThe girl did turn up.\n\nBut she wasn't alone.\n\nAt least three girls I believe, turned up, walking towards me. What was going on? I don't remember exactly what happened next, but this girl accused me of looking up her skirt or something, and then physically assaulted me, and pushed me over this small fence thing onto some dirt. I was kicked and punched. By a girl! It was both humiliating, degrading and upsetting. I cried, and the girl was merely suspended for a day or two as shes just had \"anger issues\". I can't remember what fight it was, but I remember basically the entire year group chased me, hunted for me like some kind of lynching, and faced me off, shouting at me \"We don't want you in our school!\". I got called all sorts. Most of it went on under the very noses of the teachers, who of course, did nothing, either choosing to turn a blind eye, or believing it was merely \"banter\" or some other menial exchange of words. In May that year, I had enough. After seeing a counsellor, I decided to leave. I went to the school which was about a two minute walk from me, which made far more sense, and in hindsight I shoudl ahve gone there from the start.\n\n**The Bullying re-starts**\n\nThere was a hiatus of about a year so from this. at my new school, I settled in well, and made a fair few friends. Well, most of them were merely aquitances, but this was like being in a different world compared to where I was before. There was a girl at my new school who went to my old one, and I was always consciously aware she could spill the beans on my background. She did say a thing or two about the incident of me being beaten up by a girl, but she was the kind of girl that pissed everyone off, and so she lost all credibility after repeating it about sxi times.\n\nYear 8 of school (12-13) was a good year, probably my best school year. though looking back i can see the \"friends\" i attatched myself too weren't really friends. I was the white kid who thought it was cool to chill with the black kids, they were like evanangelical christians or something, and I immersed myself into their culture. But I was mostly just used by them for stuff, like buying them lunch. Nothing came of our friendship, and I lost further contact with them when another white kid joined the group and kind of kicked me out. I had also made a group of friends with these other kids who were local to me. In hindsight, they were all little so and sos, which i will rexplain in a moment. We had a good time though.\n\nBut as seems to be the case for almost everything in my life, it didn't last.\n\nPut it simply, they turned on me and started bullying me. I think it started over some childish, pathetic thing over fake instagram accounts. I was accused of saying sometyhing to someone, which IU didn't, by one of my friends, turning them all against me. They then bullied me. It wasn't that bad, a lot of it took place online, other times they would do things like trip me up or threaten to fight me. But I was weak and timid, despite probably nearling six foot by this age.\n\nI had no friends. I started going to this place in school. It's called the oasis centre. It's basically for troubled kids who struggle with mainstream classroom learning. I got on really well with the lady who runs it. I know that year I was close to this girl, her name was Grace, and I think I basically got friendzoned on day one, but either i didn't see it, or i didn't care, I was just grateful to have a friend. But...\n\nIt didn't last.\n\nAs the year progressed, we got further apart. She stopped talking to me in class, she started sitting elsewhere. I later found out she had a boyfriend. I was admittedly quite rude to her in the end, I was jealous I can't lie, but I was so pissed off about being back to square one again.\n\n**The PTSD years**\n\nIf the next two years (2017-2019, so aged 14-16) could be characterised by something, it would be my past coming back to haunt me.\n\nI went into Year 10, hoping to start afresh, and almost be treated like a different person. But that...\n\nDidn't happen.\n\nI honestly can't remember too much about what happened in these years, as for some reason my memory of being in Year 10 (14-15) is prety rough, and most of Year 11 (15-16) was characterised by me doing my exams.\n\nThe overriding theme however in these years, was the past coming back to haunt me. Meaning? The bullying.\n\nThe bullying was probably continuing at this point, but I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about the bullyign i faced in Year 7. They weren't trying to bully me again or something - they couldn't, they went to a different school. But rather, I was becoming increasingly paranoid that somehow, they would find me again, and expose me and reveal how they bullied me, and then bully me again.\n\nThis, whilst somewhat irrational, was not completely out of the question. The shitty town I live in (yes its expensive, yes its very green and upmarket but theres nothing to do and i h ate a lot of the people) is small, and everyone seems to know everyone, particuarly with the youth population. Ocassionally, they would try to follow or message me on social media. I began to have nightmares, about being attacked again, about being found by these bullies. I would be so paranoid, whenever I went out in my town centre, I'd either literally hide in the car, or cover my face. My first, and my only instinct, was survival. I knew I couldn't fight - so I had to run, or hide. Something I've done too much of in my life. Running or hiding (avoiding) from situations, people, places. It was no life. I had imprisoned myself in my bedroom, a place where I am still in captivity. I began to see a psycologist, or some other official soundign person. But he never helped. Instead, he just expected me to open up, and seemed to be more interested in my \"*sexual fantasies\"* than anything else. But he, and others believed, I could be suffering with PTSD, given my symptoms. I'd go out ,and I thought I would see them, these bullies. But they weren't there.\n\nI did a stupid thing that year. I don't know if it was jealousy or just me being an arse, but I catfished this boy online who I had been good friends with for a long time. Our friendship had drifted apart, and I guess it was just a joke that went wrong. He found out it was me, and it ended. I had fucked things up again. I ended up catfishing other people too. I often ask myself: why? I never did it malicously. One of my rationale - me being very self conscious and self aware that I had never had a relationship - was to create an online persona of a girl that I could claim to have a relationship with, or to have her comment on my pictures. I'm so pathetic honestly. I stopped it earlier this year, though in periods of intense boredom in my life, i've done it. I never really take it very far, and I stopped doing it to people, and instead just got off on it tbh. I've found it weird, but given i've been catfished myself two times (pretty obvious , but perhaps karma lol), I'm actually quite comfortable discussing it, its more common than a lot of people think. As said, I never did it to get nude pictures of people to manipulate them with ,God no. In some ways, it benefited me? How? Because I got to see how other guys talked to girls online, somethign I was ,and probably am still terrible at. It made me realise how much guys objectify women, but also taught me a caht up line or two. I also managed to catch this arse\\*hole basically cheating on his gf, as he msessaged me asking me for nudes. I never exposed him though as it would be obvious as to who it would be. this happened quite recently. But alas, back to 2018. Now 2019. In this year, I ignored the fact I had no friends, knowing it was my last year of school, and most of the people i didnt like wouyld be leaving. I focused on my exams instead. In January, I managed to see a specialist, offering help to me with my PTSD or symptoms of PTSD with EMDR. ( Eye movement desensitization and reprocessin ). This is a relatibvely novel treatment, created in 1988. I had never heard of it, and the national health service (NHS), the free at point of use service we have in the UK, had just begun offering it. I was considered eligible for it. It aims to deal with traumatic events, such as rape, child abuse, bullying, etc etc. I can't remember exactly how it worked, but it was less about talking, and more about fiollowing hand or finger movements. Within a few months, I could go out again. I was no longer scared of the past, and the bullies. I credited this to me having faith in God. I still had faith at this point, and I believed God, not the EMDR had helped me. In hindsight, I know it was probably the EMDR that helped, but I was also perhaps unwilling to admit it.\n\nDuring these years I had also developed problems with my back. I was always self conscious of my rear sticking out quite a bit, and my spine being curved. I found this was due to kyphosis and scoliosis, as well as scheuermanns disease. In the early stages of my diagnosis, I considered killing myself once or twice, just to end the physical and mental pain of it. I couldn't run, my main hobby, my main outlet - was gone. I used to love running. I ran for miles, and miles. In the searing heat, or the frigid snow, I'd be out almost every day. And I loved it. I was self conscious about my increasingly tall stature already, at about 6'2, and having surgery would just make met taller. So I decided against it. But the pain - its bad, and it still hasn't gone. I still can't really run. But I've moved on.\n\n**A new start?**\n\nThe summer of 2019 aws one of the best times for me, even though it paled in comparison to other people's summers that involved partying, going to prom etc etc. I had no one to do these activities with. What did I do instead? Quite a lot. I began to see a lot of my grandad. I loved spending time with him. We would sit together in his room in my grandparent's retirement flat, sharing our love of country music, and sharing stories with me. He had dementia, worsening, but we could still talk. It was an extended summer, as due to exams, we finish school about six weeks earlier than everyone else. We went to Barcelona as a family, and then to Norfolk, in eastern england. I had been talking to this girl fir a while, who I had met online through social media.\n\nIn the UK, sixth form/college is the equivelant of American High School. I was hoping this would be a fresh start, as most people there were new. However, I struggled severely. I found incredibly difficult, if not impossible, to find peopl to talk to who were willing to sustain a conversation with me. Again, everything was very clicquey. For the umpteenth time in my life. I was alone. The girl I had been talking to online? We had been due to meet, I had been prepared to travel well over an hour, nearly two hours, to see her, but I found out she had been talking to someone else and was having a relationship with them. I was fuming. Then I was just upset.\n\nI seriously considered leaving school, and going to another one. But the other two that I emailed woiuld not accept me. I was screwed. I'd just have to hold out for two years at my current school. I spent mots of my free time in Oasis. I used to like it there, but now most people there were younger than me, i was the only sixth-former there, and i felt so isolated. I hated life.\n\n**Losing Grandad**\n\nWhen someone you love is suddenly admitted to hospital in an ambulance, it's never good news.\n\nHowever, my grandad had been in the local hospital so many times, and had left unscathed, usually as a consequence of a urine infection. However, I was well aware of my grandad's age, now 80, and the fact his dementia was worsening. My dad was worried - he had been called at God knows what time in the morning, some ungodly hour, and had lost patience with the hospital barrier, ramming it out of the way, much to the pleasure of other motorists waiting to get in the car park. How he avoided getting fined I still don't know.\n\nVisiting grandad would be a regular occurence in the weeks around Christmastime. What a time! He was increasingly delirious, believing he had been kidnapped by my aunt, and that he had committed a crime that he needed to \"hand himself in\" for.\n\nHe was transferred to a smaller hospital. I hated hospitals. But this one in particular. The ward was filled with other mostly elderly patients, with one shouting his head off at 10 second intervals. We'd be sitting around his bed for what felt like hours, painstakingly waiting for dinner to arrive and then for him to eat it. I was impatient, and I regret it. I remember asking my dad one time when we left hospital \"He's not coming out of hospital, is he?\". But my dad appeared to dispute this, believing he was on the road to recovery.\n\nWinter that year was a bleak and blustery affair. It was mild. Wet. Stormy. Windy. Snowless. Everything winter shouldn't be, the winter was. I'll explain it more later, but I believe due to my possible ASD, I ended up having a fixation with the weather and tempreatures, and probably had some kind of \"eco-anxiety\" for a while. It's not something I talk about often, but I do remember constantly reading alarmist headlines with regards to the climate and scarign myself to death about the future. I laugh at this now. How can I worry about what will happen in twenty, thirty years time when I have to worry about just making it to the next day?\n\nIt was one morning in...I think it ws January, maybe early February, but I could be wrong, when I was told to come downstairs \"for some news\". This...this was never going to be good. Like when my nan died, I knew something was wrong. \"It's grandad isn't he?\" I said. \"He's got cancer\" dad replied. \"He's got 3-4 months\" or something like that. I instatnyl began to cry. I was already having a sh\\*tty morning. My brother did the same. My dad didn't cry, and I've never seen him cry. I applaud him for that. He muts be a very strong man. Though I found out recently he too suffered with depression around this time due to his dad and work pressure.\n\nI saw grandad later that day, in hospital. He was going to be released and sent home. They had given up trying to help rehabilitate his mobility, and would now send him home, his final resting place.\n\nLockdown in the UK begun on the 23rd March. Schools had ended a few days earlier, the government bowing to the inevitable. I had no idea when we would be back ,but in some ways, lockdown had done me a favour: it meant that a large chunk of those two years at sixth form could be bypassed.\n\nLockdown was eerie. For the first time in my life, there was uncertainty as to whether there would be food on the table. Okay, maybe that is *slightly* dramatic, but nonetheless, there was a risk we would go hungry. I remember queuing up outside of shops, something that seems surreal, as we all piled into supermarkets, maskless, and standing right next to each other in the middle of a FUCKING PANDEMIC.\n\nTwo days into lockdown - the 25th - my nan emailed me. something vague about wanting to speak to a doctor. My nan usually sends erratic and erroneous emails and so I chose to ignore it, though I showed dad. He then got a call from nan.\n\nThere was a knock on my door.\n\nThere was bad news.\n\nGrandad had taken a turn for the worse. He wasn't well.\n\nI had not been there when my nan on my mum's side of the family had died, and I wasn't going to do the same with my grandad. \"Yes\" I said, when my dad asked me if I wanted to come. I had a duty to.\n\nI dropped the coursework I was wroking on, grabbed my phone and a charger - and we were off. 60. 70. 80. We were speeding down that highway as if it were a racetrack. It was completyely void of other traffic though. We arrived, passing friends of my grandad, oblivious to the fact he was on his deathbed. Nan had chosen to keep it from them for now. I went in to see my grandad. Social distancing had gone out the window.\n\nGrandad...grandad was in a bad way. His breathing - it wasn't right. I've never been wiht someone when they were dying before, and it made me a lot more emotional than I thought. I began to cry, as I clenched his hand. I couldn't tell if he was trying tol say something or not. He couldn't speak.\n\nWe left, and headed home.\n\nIt was later in the evening, when we got a call: grandad had died.\n\nThere was no emotion, it was, after all, the inevitable. I cracked open a bottle of cider, the only alcohol I knew at that point, and drank. One of those days! Little did I know there would be plenty more of them to come.\n\nThe cermation was a solitary and grim affair. I didn't even have a proper suit. I just wore an old school shirt and tie, my grey coat, and a pair of trousers and school shoes. I remember my nan's funeral, it was bright and lively. This was just depressing. The limits on people meant hardly anyone could be there. I had often planned about speaking about grandad's life to a large audience, but this sort of celebration never happened. The only comfort we were allowed was to toucha nd put a rose on the coffin as its made its way into the chapel. Ironic. Grandad was an atheist. The chapel doors were then promptly shut. And that was it. We were to disperse. I cried. I had not only lost my grandad. I had lost a friend. A fucking, fucking good friend. In some ways, despite the age difference, he was almost like a brother to me. And the worst part of it? WE couldn't even give him the send off he deserved.\n\n**Lockdown**\n\nThe first few weeks of lockdown weer okay. I tried to be optimisitc, patriotic even, thinking that this virus could genuinely be defeaten. I tired to think of the wars in the past and how my ancestors would have coped. All we had to do was stay inside. I told myself to stop worrying, and make the best of long walks in the frosty mornings. It really was surreal, and a part of me embraced this dystopian like world. Wearing a mask was a novelty then, I had worn one before lockdown even began. But after a few weeks, when it became clear that this would go on for more than a month, I became depressed. Particuarly given my birthday, which really was, despite my mum's best efforts, pretty crap.\n\nI wanted to make tghe most of lockdown by using it as an opportunnity to try and build relationships, friendships and otherwise, online. My new years resolution was to get a girlfriend. I was, and still am, hugely self conscious. I hate the way I look. My parents tell me im handsome and that - but they're your parents. They're not going to tell you you're fucking ugly are they? I talked to lots of girls. Nothing ever came. One of the girls i talked to - and when i say talk, i mean pretty brief - was this girl in Oasis. Her name was Alana. When i first saw her there, i thought she was about 13/14. Year 9. I found her attractive, and im cringing because of this, because I liked her tits. I found out she was year 8, which means 12/13, so i kind of stopped feeling that way about her. But in lockdown, I admitted to her online I did find her attractive. When she asked me what i liked about her? I said her tits. I'm a terrible person. I don't know what age i thought she was then, 12 or 13. She said she had a girlfriend, and nothing happened.\n\nA month later ,she asked me out. This flattered me, because this was the first girl to ever ask me out. How fucking pathetic. I said i hjad to \"think about it\". this was a delaying tactic. I knew it would be weird, especially when I established she was a fcouple of monthgs away off being 13. I'm not sure if i knew this from the start, and i have beaten myself up about this fact in the last three months or so. I ended up asking online what ppl would think of a 13y/o going out with a 17/y/o - i turned 17 a month before. The responses, confirmed my belief that this wouldn't be a good idea, even if I didn't engage in any kind of sexual activity with her. she wanted me to screw her! she asked me \"what would you do to me?\" I could kind of see where this was going. \"What do you mean?\" i ASKED. \"Sexually\" she replied. I was like \"Nothing, because you're underage\". FFS. Had I given out the wrong impression? I can't remember everything I said, but I do ask myself if i did give the idea that when we originally spoke i wanted to go out with her or something. Either way, I felt bad after first saying this, but still - did i know her age or not? She clearly acted very old for her age. She tried to convince me we could have some kind of sexual relationship, but I said no. And that was the end of it =- but all thes emonths later, I worry myself sick with this.\n\n**My first (and only) girlfriend**\n\nThe sad thing about that girl, is that I for a moment did consider about going out with her. Why? I was lonely. So, fucking lonely and pathetic. I didn't want sex from her or whatever. I even thought just about saying we were going out for lockdown, giving me time to think about it so i didn't have to see her, just to say I HAD a girlfriend. But, I'm glad I didn't just go for the first thing to come to me, esepcially not her.\n\nI began to post more on instagram in lockdown, and I re-made contact with a girl i knew from primary (elementary school). she was a couple of years younger than me (15) and began commenting on my pictures. She offered to meet me - we did so as friends. Her name was Katie. I really liked her. She was attractive, and I loved her personality. She was kind and everything. One day when we were talking online, she dropped in \"I really need a bf\" midway through a converation, casually. I offered to be hers- and she accepted. The euphoria I felt! I had a girlfriend. All these years. Finally, I had struck lucky.\n\nI remember our first date. A day or so before, trying my luck, I went to an off license and bought a bottle of vodka. I blagged my way through it,. I had been told they sold to under 18s. It wasn't even proper vodka, smirnoff ice or something. i took it with me on our first actual date. I remember sitting by the side of a dual carriageway with her, my hands around her as we drunk vodka straight from the bottle! Fuck me, we must have looked rough. But she really wasn't.\n\nWe walked and talked across town, ending up at another off license, where I bought more booze. Don't even know what it was, but it was good. We ended up snogging in the middle of a park! I was chuffed. Finally, finally. Life was being good to me. Things only got better. We met again, and again. At my house, we went for a picnic at the park, we went on ad ay out to London. This may sound sad, but this was probably one of the best times of my life, and the best thing of this entire cursed year.\n\nBut.\n\nIt had to end.\n\nAnd it only had to end too fucking soon.\n\nAbout a month and half or whatever, she sends an ominous text about wanting to speak. she says she wants to postpone our next meeting to take a break. I'm shitting myself - is it a break up - but she says no. And so I let it be. She goes on holiday. No, this isn't the bit where she meets another boy. It's the bit where I seemingly f\\*ck things up again. I'd noticed shed always sounded a bit prejudiced when talking about Muslims and other groups. More scared of them than anything. I just casually asked her about it, what she was afraid of. She flipped. She began spouting out general right-wing, racist/islamaphobic rubbish about muslims and black people. She saiud i was weird for asking her about this. I noticed she then didn't respond ot my messages properly, like one word answers. i asked whats wrong. she wasked to break up. i was upset. i was devastated. I hated myself. Why did it have to end? I asked. Everytime I get something good in my life, it dissapears!\n\n**The Depression begins**\n\nSomehow, we managed to remain on rather amicable terms, staying friends and keeping in touch. I'm not lying when I say she texted me every day. I still had feelings for her. But they weren't replicated.\n\nWe arranged to meet. For the first time since we split up - as friends. We chose the gym, as we both shared an interest in boxing. I liked boxing. Why? I realised I was half decent at it - I had so much agression inside of me, I had to channel it into something. I had turned to the bottle. Spurred on by muy success in aquriing vodka in an off license, I had also managed to get served in lots of pubs. I wasn't drinking that often. But it became an outlet for me. Alone, of course. I remember one afternoon, I came back from school. I was so angry - at my self! I had no one to blame. I just went out. I said I was going to the gym. That was a half truth. I spent the first half an hour going through town, trying to get served, throwing money down the drain as they wouldn't. I went to the gym in the end.\n\nWhen I saw Katie that day, I realised how much I missed her. What I was missing. It was almost torture to cotninue to be friends with her, but she convinced me she had MH problems of her own, and that iw as her only friend. so i stayed. But that day, I went to the pub straight afterwards - double whiskey. Scotch. It was good.\n\nBut even our friendship had to end.\n\nI was talking to her for a while before, and she was getting quite agitated at times. She said stuff like \"appreciate me - i'm all you've got\", taking advantage of the fact that it was true - she *was* my only friend. Then hse accused me of arguing with her when she said she thought I had autism, and I challen ged this. She finally flipped one day when we were etxting, casually, she said she had to stay behind at school for revision. \"that's rough\" or something lik ethat i replied. All of a sudden, she swears at me, her friends send voiec messages saying im weird, that she doesn't like me, and she blocks me. I'd had enough. It was my fault, AGAIN! I ran downstairs, looking for the first alcoholic drink I could find - cider, took it with me, and stormed out into the fields, sobbing my fucking heart out. Not just about Katie. But everything. I was a freak. I was always to blame. I couldn't do anything right! That day had torrential, and I mean torrential rain. I went outside, getting myself soaked whilst drinking. I don't know what I intended to do - run away perhaps? Kill myself? Fuck knows. But it didnt last long because my mum saw me and took me back home\n\n**Suicidal Thoughts**\n\nI began to feel extremely suicidal. I contemplated death - how would I die? I planned on suicide by cop. It's very easy to get shot by the police. This is not juts an american phenonemon. You can easily call the police, claim to have a gun or a bomb, ro say you've seen someone, wallk up towards the police, and they will shoot you. It makes you feel you have control in your death too. If you get cold feet, you can surrender. However, I was aware that I'd be putting the officer through the psycological trauma of potentially killing an innocent person. an innocent, suicidal person at that. i'd rather kill myself wiothout having to involve anyone. jumping in front of a train? A train driver will be left scarred for life, and potentially passengers. Overdosing seemed too 50/50. Eventually, my parents and school found out, and I had to get emergency phsyicatric help. They diagnosed me with clinical depression, and I saw a private consultant who diagnosed me with the same. I began my first dose of antidepressants - 20mg of flureoxeotine. It sent me up the walls. I was now off school. Before that, I already wasn't eating. I just stayed in bed. I couldn't do anything. I would now have prolonged outbursts. I'd self harmed 3 times. A fourth on the higher dose. But where before I was sleeping loads, now i kept waking up. My dreams - so vivid! I'd have struggle to pass water. Very low sex drive. Suicidal thoughts. The medication was not working.\n\nI was getting so obsessed and upset about this girl, the one who was in year 8. What if i did know her age and still said i liked her? I must be a peadophile? I deserve to die, im a terrible person? Did i say this? wait, did I say thjat? i was dreaming, thiking id said stuff which i had to wake up and ask myself - of course i didnt! I cried so much. About my grandad. Having no friends. Hating myself. The problem is me!\n\nThe closest I came to do anything suicidal was out on a walk.\n\nThe day in question - a saturday. The first day of my new job. My first job, at a supermarket. a few months prior, i would have jumped at the chance, but now i was not os sure. I've been crying lately by the easiest things. an emotional piece of music, a thought here, nature here. it makes me well up and cry. I burst out crying in broad daylight that morning.\n\nI went past these vicious, barking dogs at a farm - usually I would have shat myself and ran. But I didn't! I just stood there, and faced htem off. Nothing could scare me - if they attacked me, it wouldb e painful, but i could die at least! I crossed a bridge across the motorway. We had passed under it in a car so many times. I had seen on another bridge earlier that tyou could get tyour feet onto a surface ont he ohter sidef. I went to the side, not on the road, but just bnefore it went over the road. I climbed over, and edged towards the carriageway. I turned back. It was so spontaneous. Like the self harm. I hate the way I look. I'm skinny, i must be ugly, ive only had one gf and it didn't even last two months! Girls comment on my pictures for jokes. I went home and cried. I cried basically every day after that.\n\n**The present?**\n\nA week on from the bridge incident, I still feel so depressed. I've started back at school - an achievement, but its making me feel worse. A few people were pleaesd to see me back. It touched me in a way. I'm sure im not alone when i say suicidal people have contemplated who would be at their funerals. I'm sick of living this life. Seeing other people livign their life, going to parties, having sex, having friends and things to do. I'm juts a pathetic, sad excuse of a person. Who in their right mind is attracted to a 12/13 year old at my age? Who would make fake girlfriends because they're alone? Apparently I'm basically at the threshold for ASD. I'm getting a diagnosis, a proper one in the new year, which both reassuresm e, but also makes me feel i might just have to give up on a socail life. im fed up of living my life alone. no - im not living. im existing. I sometimes go to sleep, and hope i dont wake up. I feel like dying would take a burden off the shoulders around me. I'm disgusting. im a freak. im weird, im pathetic. But anyway, this is how someone gets to a position like this. Everyone has their own jounries and how they ended up with depression, and I encourage you to share yours if you feel comofrtable. Fuck me, its taken a long time. I'm surprised I haven't cried yet. im willing to answer or talk to anyone below. Advice, comments, criticism, whatever, feel free to put it below. I have no faith anymore, I've given up in believing in a God that would inflict such suffering on a person who has tried to be the best they can, and the suffering on the world that we have endured. If there is a God, he must be punishing me. I'm going to be 18, and to show for it? Nothing. my 18th will just be me alone. I've drunken a lot lately. Whiskey. I even had a cigarette when offered by a guy at my work. It was the only thing that could calm me down that first ,stressful shift when my thoughts about that girl, alana and everything else was goingf around my head at 100mph. Don't intend on making a habit of that though. I'm just fed up of living alone. People acted concerned when i was off (ive missed 5 weeks off skl and now worried as im supposed to be doing exams this year and then going to university) but acted like i didn't exist when I *was* at school. My life has had its good moments, but tragically, having written this, I've actually realised how much suffering I've endured over the last six years, though this probbaly styill pales in comparison to others, and if you're still going after losing multiple family members, having a life threaten*ng or changing* condition/illness, living in poverty etc, I salute you. You're a better person than I could ever be.",

When we asked again about an IMHA, she said something incoherent about him not being detained any longer, and therefore can't have one, but he hasn't been assessed yet at all. Not even a risk assessment. Not even thw COVID test that they put him in isolation on arrival for, that means I can't be physically present for him, and have to try and listen through the shitty WiFi. \n\nI am at a complete loss of what to do, I absolutely need to sort it out though.

Except for my partner it has been cancelled about 5 times. You then wait for the next appointment without anyone checking in on you. So my partner has had a few intervals of 2 weeks and 3 weeks in between appointments. This irregularity and \"being left alone with the shit that comes up in therapy\" is just really unhelpful from what I can see in my partner.\n\nThe \"therapy\" is CBT. There is nothing else on offer. I highly doubt it is the best thing for my partner and I dread to think how I will work through my childhood sexual assault trauma in CBT. I am terrified of my first appointment. The telephone triage last year was already a shitshow. I am afraid CBT will make me feel even worse like it seems to have done for my partner.\n\nMy partner is over halfway through his \"course\" of CBT. I don't feel like he is anywhere near to being \"done with therapy\". It's barely helped, they have barely worked through anything yet, he is often worse, especially when the intervals in between appointments are longer due to cancellations.\n\nI have become so cynical.

It's all waiting lists and queues.\n\nMy partner and me are lucky to have each other. It is truly truly bleak and it wouldn't be livable for either of us on their own. But I am tired, so tired. He has been suicidal quite a few times since starting therapy and I am scared and terrified of losing him. I keep it together and do my best to get him out of crisis every time. There is no one else who helps. I am worried what would happen if both of us are in crisis at the same time. Thankfully this has not happened yet.\n\nI worry for the people who do not have family or a partner. We don't have anyone else or family apart from each other so it's already super lonely and hard but I worry for the people who are truly all alone and have to deal with this absolute lack of proper mental health care.

I mean I told the person they were just as fucked in the head as me but other than that I've really tried pretending it didn't happen but I can't.  \n\n\nI question everything I think and say/ type because what kind of immature self centred idiot am I? Why can't I just get over myself and my stupid trauma. Why can't I ever just be happy? And worst of all it's really triggering my suicidal tendencies.I'm fighting as hard as I can because I've only got two weeks of therapy left, I really need to stay on this medication and I need to survive to see my favourite band in June next year, and I need to not have any more attempts because I bought a single ticket and if my family can't trust me then I won't be able to go.  \n\n\nAnd like my therapist told me about the Service Users Network and I tried to call them this morning but no one picked up so I left a message but I haven't heard back from anyone and this is like one of my only lifelines after I finish therapy in two weeks.  \n\n\nI can't do this. I'm not going to kill myself but I just can't cope.",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nWith the permission of the moderators, I am posting this request.\n\nMy name is Susie Bennett, and I am a researcher at the University of Glasgow. Through my work I look to understand male suicide risk and recovery factors better. As some of you may know too well, male suicide is the biggest killer of men under 50 in Britain, and according to the Samaritan’s three-quarters of all suicides in 2018 were male. Having seen people I love experience these feelings, I wanted to build a greater understanding of what causes suicidal feelings and behaviours in men and what more can be done to help.\n\nI have developed a survey to explore some of these issues. The survey takes 30 minutes to complete and covers topics including childhood experiences, self-esteem, connection with others and mental pain as well as suicidal feelings. Even if you have never had suicidal thoughts or feelings before, your answers would still give me valuable insights. The survey is open to all men 18 and over, located any where. The more men I can get to complete the survey, the stronger my analysis can be, so please do share this post and details with friends, family, colleagues, community groups, or drop me a message if you know a way I could help get it out to more people. Your support would be greatly appreciated.\n\nHere is the survey link: [https://glasgow-research.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/males](https://glasgow-research.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/males)\n\nPlease do let me know if you have any questions and please do complete the survey if you feel moved to or share this post if appropriate.\n\nMany thanks, everyone,\n\nSusie",

I feel so fortunate to be able to do this, my mental health suffered severely whilst doing my education but I knew if I didn't work as hard as I did, I wouldn't be able to afford therapy. Weirdly enough I knew that when I was literally a child - there's no help out there.\n\nI'm just wondering what other people do? Once the 6 sessions are over, does the NHS provide more? Is there other help available? Do people go private? Or the majority just manage with or without medication but no therapy?",

    "selftext": "I have been under various NHS MH teams including CAMHS since I was 16, I’m now 25, I really don’t know what actual meaningful support I had from services for the past 9 years and they are still treating me like I have to jump through all the hoops like an animal in a clown performance. \n\nI had a S117 meeting today, and was told that my CMHT have no idea when my current care co will return (I only met her once and she’s been off sick since and I had no contact from a care co or anyone after I was discharged from hospital), after two months they are now looking at reallocating when I have barely started with someone. I had 6-7 different care cos under my previous CMHT so dare I say I’m really not surprised at all with this inconsistency.\n\nI asked about therapy in the NHS (I have been paying privately myself to see a psychologist which is costing an arm and a leg but it’s what I really need). I sought private help after being essentially misunderstood at my last NHS psychology assessments which I waited 2 years for and being forced to accept a label I fit no criteria and in the meantime hearing about bullshit that diagnosis doesn’t matter when they make it matter because it changes the whole way we are treated. It’s not fair that I have to fund my own treatment that I really need under our supposedly public health system, I have done enough waiting, and jumping through hoops. \n\nI was told by my new CMHT that therapy is available but there’s another 1-2 years wait to be assessed, and the sessions would be time limited and they are unsure what type of therapy they can actually offer until my assessment and after any further discussion with the psychology team. For the last 9 years the only ‘therapy’ I had under NHS was very limited to lower level workbook type stuff with a care coordinator, I’m not hopeful for any meaningful 1:1 work with a qualified psychologist even if it’s just CBT because I haven’t even had that. I seriously don’t know how I will ever be able to access or be offered the trauma therapy I really need by a NHS service, it feels too threatening and unsteady that I don’t think I can engage with it. Is there any hope of these services at all, is the wait worth it?\n\nMy private psychologist joined the S117 meeting as well and she raised a good point that I need one consistent professional around me long term which seems it’s just not possible under any teams. I haven’t even started with my care co and now I’m potentially being reallocated.\n\nSocial care was there as well, because I’m moving out of student accommodation (which has some in built student welfare support) into independent living that I may have more social care needs. I asked if it is possible to have funding for a support worker under S117. The answer is I have to work with their independence team first (which I have been waiting for since my hospital discharge 2 months ago), and any further discussions and plans for a longer term care package are only considered if the assessment and intervention decides there is a need. I feel this is very discriminating for those like me who have been forced to be independent and manage everything on our own (I’m a care leaver) so it’s then decided that we don’t need such support when in fact the stress of mundane life can have an overwhelming toll on my mental health leading to crisis and relapse. That’s been the story of my life as a young adult.\n\nConclusion on healthcare from my S117 meeting is still primarily medication focused and nothing else. There’s no change with social care despite my major change of circumstances. I’m really sick of this.\n\nMy immediate response is I want to dig a hole and hide, never having to speak to CMHT or social services again. \n\nSeriously, how many more hoops do I need to jump before I get offered something meaningful? For reference, I have a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder, autism and complex PTSD. I have been under secondary care my entire adult life, have been admitted/sectioned 6 times, but never received any other support or therapy other than sporadic contact with a consultant psychiatrist and/or care coordinator. I have yet to have a care co whom stayed for longer than 3-4 months.\n\nAt this point I swear it’s easier for me to work out my cost of living, therapy costs and do the amount of hours I need to work to afford my ongoing care than to have an upsetting and fruitless argument with the services. I’m lucky I can earn enough to do so although that’s also stressful but I rather that means that I can progress with life and my career than being readmitted under the MHA year after year.\n\nWhere is the care for people with long term and severe mental illnesses?\n",

We've checked everything was up to date, added things, removed dead links, reformatted and updated the whole thing on a new post. As of June 2024, all the links should be working and have the most recent information. We largely sourced our information from the [Hub of Hope](https://hubofhope.co.uk/), a fantastic database of UK mental health resources. The masterpost will be pinned to the top of the sub for easy access.\n\nIn terms of navigating the masterpost, there is firstly a list of regions which you can click. These will take you to the **regional offshoot posts**, which list resources based on UK location and are broken down by county.\n\nPast the list, you'll find a list of **mental health helplines** that operate nationally or over larger areas. These helplines are broken down by type – general MH, LGBT+, child/domestic/sexual abuse and violence, honour based abuse/violence (including forced marriage and FGM), addiction, children and young people, older people (including dementia and Alzheimer's), bereavement (including pet loss), crime victims, eating disorders, learning disabilities and parenting.\n\nAfter the helplines, we've added a list of **national mental health groups and charities**. Regional charities can be found in the side posts, accessible from the list at the top of the masterpost.\n\nLastly, we've added a section for **further resources and information**. Topics are in alphabetical order, and although I won't list them all here, include links to information and resources on self help, legislation, work and benefits, patient rights, and therapy.\n\nI'd also like to take this opportunity to share with you our [**brand new medication masterpost**](https://www.reddit.com/user/MentalHealthUKMods/comments/1cy05aj/rmentalhealthuk_medication_masterpost/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), which includes links to BNF entries on many medications, an FAQ, and links to further reading.\n\nWe have also compiled common [NICE guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/user/MentalHealthUKMods/comments/1dgtgs4/rmentalhealthuk_nice_guidelines/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) into one post and broken them down by topic for reference and easy reading.\n\nWe are currently working on an extended, updated sub FAQ and a new wiki, which we hope to share with you all soon.\n\nThank you all for your contributions and support, and for making this community so great. We really appreciate each and every one of you, whether you're a patient or a professional, looking for advice or giving it, a viewer or a commenter.\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, please do leave a comment or send a modmail to the sub.

    "selftext": "I 29(M) referred myself directly to my local IAPT service (East of England) around a year ago for help with depression and suicide, it took me several years to summon the courage just for that referral and it's left me perpetually terrified of seeking further help. \n\nFollowing my referral I was quickly assessed and told I had severe depression & anxiety. I told them about my history and they were concerned with the fact I am a veteran with some associated trauma and a sexual assault that happened as a teenager. The clinician mentioned she would need to raise my case to someone else because she didn't believe the CBT they offered would be effective and that I should await her call.\n\nUnfortunately that's where it all fell apart. It took 43 days for me to achieve any sort of further contact with the service following my initial assessment. I was pretty peeved having told them I was actively planning to commit suicide, but ironically, because I was so angry; actually kept me alive in giving me the motivation to hold the service to account for their inaction. \n\nI was eventually sent a single page letter with some boilerplate information. My presenting problems were decribed as 'average day-to-day stresses' and a discharge plan with hyperlinks to 4 websites. I felt completely ignored and couldn't understand what I had done wrong. Everyone always says you just have to make contact and reach out, people are ready to listen. But I wasn't listened to at all.\n\nNaturally I escalated this through the complaints procedure; and was told that my clinician had taken a leave of absence from work and not passed on my case to someone else. I won't bore you with the details, but this was escalted to the deputy clinical lead of the trust. Regardless, it did nothing.\n\nAfter all was said and done, and I asked what my next steps were, I was told the following in writing, that there was no treatment for me on the NHS and I would likely have to pay for counselling:\n\n*\" I appreciate that the experience was certainly not one you would have  wanted.  As mentioned, we’ll be raising your concerns in the service.* \n\n*Unfortunately the NHS tends not to have commissioned services which offer longer term counselling-related  treatment, especially not in primary care, which is why we make use of signposting to other organisations, such as third sector ones, if services users need more longer term work. This is not always ideal of  course, but we sometimes need to weigh up whether inviting an individual in for a brief intervention would cause more harm than good, and whether the modalities we offer are a good fit for the presenting difficulties.*\n\n*There are other third sector organisations in the Mid Essex area that offer low cost counselling, which are very good, and I’d be happy to provide  their details if that would be helpful.\"*\n\nTo this day I have been unable to secure a talking therapy other than an introductary session with a charity, primarily due to the insane demand outstripping supply, I can't afford to pay for long term counselling privately. And today I have been told by a university I am thinking of applying to that I would need 6 months of evidence on a treatment plan pass their occupational health checks. \n\nMy question I suppose then is, what on earth do I do? The most dangerous period in my life has been following the IAPT fiasco, I do not want to go through the same again because I don't think I'm resillient enough to cope. Yet I feel like I probably have to if I want to get on a treatment plan. My GP surgery is absolutely useless and is in special measures, I'm just a little overwhelmed and frankly scared that I need something fairly specialised that I'm never going to have access to.\n\nAny insight would be greatly appreciated, many thanks.",

    "selftext": "[https://www.madintheuk.com/2022/12/boarding-school-bad-children-syndrome/](https://www.madintheuk.com/2022/12/boarding-school-bad-children-syndrome/)\n\nBeing sent to boarding school can cause severe harm to children. This is evident from testimonies gathered by therapists, journalists and courtrooms. So why do parents trust their children to these institutions?\n\nIn the UK, around 75,000 children board. The majority are in fee-paying independent schools; 5,000 attend state boarding schools. In total, boarders account for approximately 0.5% of British schoolchildren. However, as adults, they are disproportionately represented in public life. Three of the last six prime ministers went to boarding school. In June 2021, 37% of Boris Johnson’s cabinet[ had been boarders](https://www.pepf.co.uk/opinion/the-0-7-per-cent-problem-is-much-worse-than-the-7-per-cent-problem/). Decisions which affect all our lives are made by psyches forged in these institutions.\n\n‘The sorts of damage that people experienced in the past was as a result of a very harsh regime’, then-headmistress of Cheltenham Ladies College Vicky Tuck[ told *The Guardian*](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/may/11/publicschools.schools) in 2008, ahead of a parliamentary select committee investigating boarding schools.\n\n‘It is not like that today’, she added.\n\nBut it is not just cold showers and canes that hurt; it is the separation of child from home. Denial of this is common among proponents of boarding. In 2011, then-head of the Boarding Schools’ Association Hilary Moriarty[ told *The Independent*](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/boarding-is-as-damaging-as-being-taken-into-care-says-therapist-2274066.html), ‘I don’t think you would find a single unhappy boarder now because children wouldn’t stay, and parents would not keep them there’.\n\nIt is both disturbing and revealing that an adult so ignorant of the child psyche led the boarding school industry body.\n\nIn 2014, experts including psychoanalyst Susie Orbach and emeritus consultant psychiatrist Dr Felicity de Zulueta[ signed an open letter](https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2014/may/10/the-big-issue-boarding-schools-abuse) demanding an end to ‘early boarding’, which begins at seven years old.\n\n‘The suffering caused by the British habit of sending children away from parental love and the safety of their homes to educational institutions has been ignored for much too long,’ they wrote.\n\n‘Boarders lose out on a normal childhood. Children may learn to function competently, but at the cost of dissociation from their feelings of abandonment.’\n\nYet the Boarding Schools’ Association still[ promotes early boarding](https://www.boarding.org.uk/for-parents-pupils/why-boarding/). Its website reads: ‘A seven-year-old is likely to find themself sharing a large bedroom with about half a dozen other youngsters…This companionship, coupled with a busy life inside and outside the classroom, and easy contact with parents, helps a child to weather the early days of missing home and begin to enjoy all that school life has to offer’.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI was sent to boarding school at thirteen. I did not want to go. I told my parents, but they did not listen. Three of my four older half-siblings had also been sent away. The eldest refused to return after his GCSEs. The second-eldest was expelled from one boarding school and ran away from another. The third was badly bullied in their first year. They rang my mother from the payphone in tears, pleading to be brought home. My mother refused.\n\nDespite this record, my parents sent me away too, to the school at which my older sibling had been bullied.\n\nMy first dormitory was less than double the size of my bedroom at home, yet was shared with five other girls. Three sets of bunk beds clustered in the middle. Desks lined the perimeter, facing either the window or the wall. The room was so small that only one person could walk round it at a time. The furniture had been used by dozens of girls before me; nothing was mine.\n\nThe piece continues...",

    "title": "Gut-wrenching experience with NHS specialist",
    "selftext": "I suppose I'm looking for advice after a somewhat traumatic experience I had with an NHS ADHD specialist I was referred to. This wasn't the first time I have had a horrible experience with someone I was referred to by the NHS and it's really making it difficult to reach out again. I should probably preface this by saying I suffer from a variety of mental health related problems; Chronic insomnia, social anxiety, depression and what I've always thought to be ADHD.\n\nSo after waiting around 3 years for an initial ADHD assessment, the appointment happened to land during a downward spiral which had already caused me to stop following up with my GP, stop taking my anti-depressants and I stopped communicating with the sleep clinic I was referred to, needless to say I was at a pretty low-point in my life. At the time of the (over the phone) appointment I hadn't slept for close to 3 days, partly due to my general sleep problems but also due to the immense stress involved with an important appointment as well as my crippling anxiety over speaking over the phone. I also hadn't prepared anything towards the appointment as my ability to prepare and organise myself is part of the problem.  \n\n\nThe appointment started off normally, the doctor began with some basic questions like why I think I may have ADHD, to give some examples etc. After about 10 minutes she began to inquire about my depression which I briefly mentioned previously and I decided to go all out and not hold anything back as she was the first clinical mental health professional I had ever spoken and so thought I could trust her. We talked about the depression for around 20 minutes which made me quite emotional as I'm normally quite reserved about my mental health and rarely find myself speaking about it so bluntly. I should probably mention here that throughout the conversation we had slight communication problems as she had a rather strong accent and I have poor hearing, not to mention the fact that I struggle to concentrate and focus on conversations, especially over the phone and so I had frequently asked her to repeat questions. I was beginning to think that she was getting annoyed by this but I brushed that thought off. Admittedly as we got back to more questions related to my ADHD I was having problems elaborating and providing examples due to my aforementioned problems. It all unexpectedly escalated when after asking her to elaborate a question she began to repeat it, so I stopped her and reiterated that I was asking her to elaborate and not repeat the question. This is where she went on a tirade saying that I'm being extremely rude and unengaged with the conversation and that I cannot even elaborate on my own feelings or experiences and that this was a waste of time. I was completely stunned and didn't even know how to react and just started crying. She continued on saying that due to my inability to communicate it was possible that I'm autistic and despite showing symptoms of ADHD she didn't get enough out of me for it to be likely (I'm paraphrasing here) Still completely shocked and sobbing away, I tried to reason that this wasn't a conventional conversation and so it didn't reflect my communication skills accurately. (It's important to mention that she made very little effort throughout the inquiry to get me to elaborate on my feelings and experiences despite the fact that I was clearly struggling) From this point on I can hardly remember how the conversation ended, all I remember is that I was at a loss for words and barely responded at this point and the call ended shortly after with her suggesting I refer myself to IAPT and to look into other diagnoses. I was absolutely devastated and confused. The only remotely rude thing that I could possibly think of having done is not saying anything before hanging up and that was because I was in the middle of a severe panic attack. Needless to say this was a miserable experience.  \n\n\nSo to conclude this I suppose I was hoping for some advice as to my options. I'm not looking to report the specialist or anything like that, I do not have the energy or willpower for that. Do I have any other options to get diagnosed other than privately and would it even be possible to get referred to another NHS specialist after not having passed the initial assessment phase the first time. I have heard that it is very difficult to get an ADHD diagnosis in the UK and I'm guessing it will be even more difficult now, through the NHS at least.  \n\n\nPerhaps it might be worth mentioning that I've looked for a diagnosis primarily so that my hyperactivity might be treated as it is one of the main reasons I've had trouble sleeping since I was a child, though other problems have been making it worse now that I'm an adult. While the inattentiveness and inability to concentrate are extremely frustrating, the insomnia is truly crippling. For reference sake, the average from my sleep diary while at the sleep clinic came out to about 25 hours of sleep a week, sleeping 5 out of 7 days. I've spoken to my GP about this (my insomnia, not the experience above) and all the sleeping pills she prescribed were either ineffective or came with side effects and so she wanted to try me on anti-depressants that also  help with sleep however she couldn't prescribe most as I had unexplained tachycardia every time I took and ECG.  \n\n\nThanks for reading this huge block of text, I'm slowly recovering after being in a dark place for a while and trying to get back on track with my mental health treatment and it was nice to get this off my chest.",

In total £1050 from UC and then £300 from work and £200 to pension from work. (Specifically the limit of what I'm allowed). This then leads to a comfortable amount and secure income. (Work is great but extremely unreliable and part-time only). \n\nHowever, there are a few problems with it. \n\n\\- Minimum wage jobs have become pointless for me as they are less money than UC and to be perfectly honest wildly unsuitable due to my illness (Schizoaffective). If they are not the full 40 hours - which most aren't - completely unsuitable and pointless. \n\n\\- Cannot increase from this amount of money unless I find a full time job - this is ok, however, it has been almost 3 years since graduating and I haven't found a suitable and \"worth it\" full time job. Not for want of trying. \n\n\\- Cannot save above £6000 - While this is 1. not a problem right now, I've just paid all my debt and am now saving and under this. 2. also unfair to full time workers. It leaves me in an awkward position - stuck in a trap. \n\n\\- If I lived with a partner they would have to support me as my universal credit would be cut dramatically depending on their earnings. I am male and you can say whatever you want there is a massive stigma around this. \n\nIt leaves me stuck in a trap - the Universal Credit Disability Trap! \n\nI'll never own a home - I'll never rent a moderate sized place - I can't afford to live with a partner - I can't afford to drive (banned anyway so meh) \n\nStuck - Comfortable and secure - but absolutely bleh. \n\nI tried to work in a factory - didn't last a week. \n\nI am studying a Masters in engineering management but can't drive anywhere so it's kinda pointless. \n\nI am trying to teach myself web development and make a number of side projects alongside all of this. \n\nNo one will hire me and I daresent tell the universal credit people about my websites though they aren't profitable yet.

I've run out of places to turn to.\n\nI have L2 autism, as in I can't function like a normal adult and I've never had a job or finished school. I rarely change my clothes because the sensory shock is dysregulating and strings of tasks burn out my brain. I rarely shower because it's too complicated and exhausting. Public places feel like a tsunami of information in my brain. Crossing roads is confusing and I can't understand public transport. Also, the cramped sensory noise of it.\n\nI've never had a social life, I'm semi verbal with processing delay and back/forth conversation is so exhausting it sends me into shutdown on the floor. I live with my mother, who I inherited my neurology from and she doesn't behave like a functional adult either. I have nobody responsible in my life to help me in a deep way.\n\nI feel so isolated and desperate. I used to find isolation really easy because I was driven purely by my special interests and hyperfixations, but now at age 28 I feel alone. My only natural talent is collecting information into meaningless lists.\n\nI'm not smart enough to specialise at anything. I can't study. My ADHD jumbles up my brain so I can't focus. I have 100 distractions at once. I can't even go to doctor anymore, I don't have the functional capacity to do complex tasks because I spent 9 months fighting the NHS for autism help and now I have burnout. I've tried self-medicating with OTC stimulants for ADHD but they triggered debilitating energy crashes and meltdowns.\n\nI don't know how to do this another 50 years, like, what on Earth do I do to occupy myself with such limited capacity? I'm so sick of the internet. I live in fear of orphanhood because then I'll have absolutely nobody left to help me survive. My report says I have severe functional impairments but they've understated bits of my condition to prevent me losing autonomy.\n\nI'm on welfare. I can't afford private help and I can't travel or do online video. It has to be face to face at the local GP but the NHS doesn't accommodate autism/disability like that, even if there was a service available. I just wish I AT LEAST had a counsellor to talk to on a regular basis about how lonely and alienated I am.\n\nThe alienation from the rest of society is hell. I can't relate to other women because of autism, they can wear makeup and fancy clothes and talk about relationships and jobs, but I'm unwashed and like collecting information into lists. I haven't participated in society since 2014, when I dropped out of school with autistic burnout. I feel so sub-human because of autism and every time I ask for help, I'm refused it.\n\nI miss primary school because of the certainty, structure and parallel social time. There was no expectation to socialise like a neurotypical as long as you followed the classwork. I desperately need something like that in my life but no carer who could arrange it.\n\n💔 I don't know what to do anymore. I'm so depressed about my fate. I worked really hard in school but it wasn't enough to become a high functioning adult. ",

I've never felt like I want to actually live my life and I've always felt unable to do things other people can do. I see people my age making plans for their future, finishing university, and starting their careers. I don't want any of that. I don't want to even leave my bed 90% of the time. I don't want to go out, speak to my family and friends, cook, clean, whatever. I feel like people assume I'm lazy but it isn't a choice for me. I hate living like this. I want very badly to want to live, but I just don't.\n\nThroughout this, I feel that medical professionals are unable or just unwilling to actually pinpoint the cause of my issues.  Every psychologist or therapist gives me the same ineffective, infuriating advice on how to ~think mindfully~ to cope. I understand this may work for some, but i think it should be obvious to them by now that these kinds of therapies do not work for me. I don't want to spend the rest of my life coping with symptoms that medical professionals refuse to actually treat.\n\nI have had psychologists suggest things they think I am exhibiting symptoms of- most recently OCD and cPTSD, but nobody is actually bothering to assess me for them. I'm supposed to be seeing a psychiatrist for further assessment in a few weeks, but I have a gut feeling it will turn out exactly the same as every other attempt I have made to figure out why my life is so unbearable to face. \n\nI don't know how to make medical staff actually care enough to want to tell my why I am the way that I am. And its causing me to miss out on help that I desperately need because certain avenues of support are only available to those with an official diagnosis.\n\nI guess i want to know how everyone else has managed to make their NHS medical staff actually care about them enough to push for proper treatment and care, and an actually effective assessment. Because so far all of my assessments have apparently just confused the staff and they've said I \"exceed their criteria to treat\" and that they are \"not able to provide the care I need\" so they refer me to someone else and the cycle starts again.\n\nApologies for the long post. I'm a little frustrated. Any advice would be appreciated.",

I'm writing shit down, guys. \n\nToday, I got a phone call from the complaints commission to go over more details of my complaints - they did ask if I wanted to cancel my complaint as I'd been given an appointment, but if they're happily treating me like this, I don't doubt they're treating others the same. \nI gave them more details and was told I'd hear back within 25 days ideally but occasionally 4 months. I then got a letter stating my issues to my email.\n\nI'm mostly writing this to encourage folks who may be on the fence about complaining, I definitely was until I read some articles about what happens.

    "selftext": "Hey everyone, so I somehow found the courage to actually go to the GP today to talk about the hallucinations I’ve been having & I just wanted to share my experience so far/get some advice/hear other people’s experiences. \n\nSo the hallucinations I’ve been experiencing the past week have been:\n\nAuditory hallucinations: \n- I’ve been hearing my flat intercom ringing practically 24/7 (I can’t tell the difference between when it’s actually ringing irl or not. Although I only hallucinate that it’s ringing when I’m in a different room, when I stand in front of it I no longer hear it ringing)\n- I’ve heard police sirens outside my building a few times, for hours each time when there’s no police there \n- I’ve heard lorry’s reversing outside, also for hours when there isn’t any there \n- I’ve heard my phone ringing a few times but when I’ve checked it I’ve had no missed calls \n- I’ve heard a bee flying around my room & right by my ear but I can’t actually see one here\n- Random beeps/alarms \n- Random loud bangs like someone has dropped something or is trying to break in\n- The sound of rain when it’s not raining \n- The sound of an owl & the sound of birds tweeting\n- I’ve heard a few different types of ‘music’. Creepy piano music (like the piano version of music from a horror film), the piano version of the first 10 seconds of an ABBA song over & over again, random sounds from an electric keyboard, also the sound of a choir (no actual words just like ‘ahhhhhhh, ehhhhhh, ahhhhhh’.  \n- The sound of a clown nose being honked\n- The sound of a UFO?? And a few other random/weird sounds which are basically indescribable \n\n\nVisual hallucinations: \n\n- I’ve seen shadows moving across my room in the dark a few times (a shadow jumped right into my face while I was hearing the clown nose sound last night) \n- I’ve seen clouds of smoke moving towards me in the dark twice\n- My vision sometimes seems staticky in the dark\n- I’ve seen an orange tinted circle (as if I was looking through a small circular orange glass) move around my vision in my right eye\n- My hand appeared to be moving, similar to the effect of looking at something under water, but this also only happened when looking through my right eye\n- The pattern of my duvet looks different through my right eye & the colours of it seem more vivid\n\n\nTactile hallucinations: \n\n- I keep feeling insects crawling on me \n- Keep feeling large vibrations from my pillow \n\n\nSo the conditions I know I have are: depression, generalised anxiety, social anxiety, panic disorder, agoraphobia, binge eating disorder & ADHD. I’m also possibly Autistic & have suspected Auditory Processing Disorder. I’ve been Googling these hallucinations & from what I read I genuinely believed I would go to the GP today & be told I just have severe tinnitus as I’ve had tinnitus in the past & apparently most of these sounds can be caused by that. Or I thought I would be told I have an ear infection as my ear was hurting last week & apparently certain types of ear infections can cause hallucinations. I also believed the visual hallucinations were caused by Charles Bonnet syndrome as it can be caused by cataracts which I have. The visual hallucinations are worse in my right eye which is the eye that the cataracts are worse in as well. I thought the combination of these things were just making me paranoid I was losing my mind because of how anxious I constantly am. \n\nAnyway that obviously wasn’t how things went. My GP said he believes I’m having genuine hallucinations & has referred me to the Early Intervention Team who support people with psychosis & said they should contact me within 48 hours. I’m feeling proud of myself for going & I’m grateful he took me seriously, I was really worried he would laugh & think I was being ridiculous. At the same time though, I don’t really know how to feel? He didn’t check my ears or suggest I should get an opinion from an ophthalmologist or audiologist. Shouldn’t that be considered if I have genuine problems with my eyes & ears? Perhaps I have a misconception about what psychosis is but I just find it hard to believe it’s that when I’m not hearing any voices etc. I have been experiencing derealisation, wondering if I am actually dead because everything feels very unreal, but I’ve had this in the past anyway due to my anxiety. I’m starting to question whether I’m exaggerating these hallucinations because I find it hard to believe it could be psychosis. \n\nI’m now just sat here feeling extremely anxious, worrying that I have no control over what I see or hear. I’m scared about what’s going to happen & if I’m actually going to lose control. I currently hear the police sirens, the choir singing & the electric keyboard sounds all at the same time, all coming from different directions. There’s so much noise that it’s impossible to ignore it. I can’t stop shaking bc I’m just waiting for a new creepy sound to start now. I feel quite paranoid about any noise I hear incase it’s not actually real & I’m hallucinating it. \n\nHas anybody had an experience with psychosis they can share with me? Is it common to have hallucinations like this where you don’t hear actual voices talking to you? Has anybody had experience with the Early Intervention Team & can tell me what to expect? \n\nShould I try to get an opinion from an ophthalmologist & an audiologist as well to make sure this is actually the reason or should I just leave that now? I just don’t want to be diagnosed with something if I genuinely don’t have it. If I’m offered antipsychotic medication I’ll be scared to take it until I know this is 100% why I’m hallucinating, as apparently they can cause hallucinations if you don’t actually have psychosis. \n\nMy family are not very understanding of my mental health issues & usually just shame/mock me for them so I’m not sure what to do about this. Do you think I should tell them? I’m not sure how I’m going to hide it from my mum if I have to see the Early Intervention Team regularly as she’s quite nosey. I’m also about to fail uni & this might help make it clearer to them that I’m not actually choosing to be lazy, as they believe, but I’m just really struggling atm. On the other hand though, telling them could definitely make things worse for me. Telling them about my previous problems has never helped, it’s only made my relationship with them more difficult so it is a big risk. \n\nSorry for the long post, just feeling lonely, confused & scared. Just needed to talk it out.",

I think I would still take it if it was not for her, however, I do struggle at times to justify taking it given the side effects.\n\nThe transition into spring and summer is always a difficult time for me in terms of triggering a more elevated mood. I think maybe it is that which is making it harder for me at the minute as there are some small signs of being more \"up\" in terms of staying up later listening to music, feeling more connected to music, feeling more social etc. I think that is making it harder to accept too.\n\nAs a MH professional it is harder to admit you sometimes struggle to accept the diagnosis and the need for medication.

    "selftext": "I'm currently in my first year of taking my A-levels. I'm predicted high grades and my teachers/head of year are convincing me to formulate a plan of what I want to do after sixth form. \n\nI've struggled with my mental health for a few years now, and recently I had been in the darkest place I'd ever been, planning and seriously thinking about committing suicide after years of chronic suicidal ideation. I also suffer with chronic pain, and I feel this is certainly a driving force for my poor mental health.\n\nAnyhow, my head of year has been supporting me through this after I opened up about how awful I was feeling and how sincere I felt about this plan I had to take my life. She's been checking in with me frequently. She's not trained in dealing with these types of situations but she's experienced in her job and does her best and I greatly appreciate her, however, sometimes I feel that she can be unintentionally invalidating. She's very solution based and tries to encourage me to implement loads of things to try and improve my mental health/ relationships with parents/ chronic pain etc. I appreciate her help very much but sometimes it feels like she's pushing me too much, overestimating me and sometimes I find it hard to think that going for a walk or socialising will help me feel less suicidal.\n\nShe brought up university today and I just felt my heart sink. It's so hard for me to think ahead a few weeks, let alone a year or two. I may not be actively suicidal right now, but I still want to die. Life has little value to me and it hurts me to think i'll be here in a few years from now, at uni or in a job. I don't know, It made me feel very invalidated and misunderstood but I can't blame her or the situation, I can't avoid these things, as long as I'm alive I am progressing and my future gets closer. Talking about university and potential degrees makes me feel terrible, like I want to just commit suicide right away. \n\nWhat do I do? thinking to the future feels impossible for me and makes me feel incredibly apathetic, but ignoring it would be foolish. The more I think about it, the more suicidal I feel. I don't know what to do :( I'm not much of a crier, but tonight I just broke down because it hurts me so much to think I'll have to grow up and live and move forward.",

It was the most invalidating experience.   \n\n\nFirst of all she was telling me if i have mh issues i shouldnt have high responsibilities jobs (not like she is wrong but cant she say also that i was strong to do this? Anyway explained that i just lead naturally and genuinely care and enjoy and that the problem is not stress or pressure anyway ) and she was like i just need a sick note for 1 or 2 weeks and ill be fine (bruv)  \n\n\n and then when she wanted to give me apmnt when im supposed to be away for xmas and when i said i was supposed to go to france she said \"oooh you see you can do things etc *ffs if you knew how i feel about not looking like i cant work...* \" then she was so mad at me saying like the France is on red list (????) and like im stupid and i should be ashamed for not being informed about apparently today new restrictions (bro its only noon and also i dont find those ?)  \n\n\n Anyway i tried to say that i actually dont feel like going so if i cant its fine  but she was so mad still. And then since i have a different in person appointment next week i asked if it was with her or not, when she said no i said i wanted to be in touch with the person before meeting (i was already crying uncontrollably and she was making it worse and i wanted to explain how to not trigger a meltdown via a message on my journal or something) i didnt even manage to finish to explain that that she was like \"i know everything i write everything he will know blabla\" and i was feeling worse and closer to not even being able to speak anymore.  \n\n\n I quickly realized that i couldnt get in touch with him and decided i would deal with it and repeated \"ill come ill be fine no problem thank you\" but the woman on the phone kept going like \"you are not  gonna be crying 7/7 24/24\",' today its different\" \"we have  tons of claimants that are ill they have cancer depression etc and they are not asking that *the  absolutely worst, thx i know im a fucking piece of shit*\", \"why you cry? What do you want to say *not letting me explain*\" \"get that 1 week sick note\" \"it was supposed to be 15 min now its 45\"   \n\n\ni just wanted it to end i was actually having a meltdown and she couldnt have handled it worse. At least it was not in person. Im going to write a message on a paper that i will show at my appointment next week  and i hope the guy would be a bit more empathetic because i truly do not want to breakdown at the job center esp in front of ppl who dont understand that i cant control the fuck of it  \nSeriously even just on the phone it feels like really awful... I really hate being like this and dont choose and im  not a crybaby   \n\n\nAbout the sick note im so fucking dumb that last time i spoke to my usual gp i said i was unemployed but didnt ask for sick note... He is no available in the next 2 weeks but my surgery (bless them) gave me emergency special appnmt but might be with someone who doesn't know me and im already terrified that the same kind of shit than today happen..    \n\n\nTldr  my uc coach is horrible and makes me feel guilty more that i am already about suffering from invisible disabilities  \n\n\nUpdate: she posted a message stating what i apparently declared during the phone call and its total bullshit. I tried to reply politely and asked if we had been recorded. Im planning to report this",

I'm sure this has gotten worse for most people since the pandemic began but mine seems to have started before that.\n\nI recently had a MH review and from that the psychiatrist  tweaked my meds and it seems to be helping with my other MH issues. I've got a new support worker (as well as my care coordinator) and he seems lovely and we're going to slowly work through issues like accessing therapy, my social anxiety etc.\n\nHowever there are still times (every single day) where I'll know I'll need to do something important or just to occupy time and there will be a disconnect (from a few hours to a few days) between telling myself to do it & actually getting it done.\n\nI've suspected ADHD for awhile (I also have ASD) , I’ve done some online screening tests and mentioned it to the psychiatrist who recommended getting a referral to the local ADHD service through my GP but; I know there'll probably be a long wait + I always procrastinate getting things done.\n\nI’m just worried that I know something is causing these blips in motivation and attention that doesn’t seem like just Autism (or my other MH issues) but then again because of these blips I put off initiating the first steps to finding out however if I don’t find out and get proper treatment whatever that may be I don’t know how I can see myself being fulfilled and achieving the things I want. \n\nSorry for the long post, does anyone have any advice? Should I just see if I can get a referral/find out the wait time for the ADHD service? Thank you!",
