For example she used my words against me a bit, implying that she felt betrayed like questioning me about how we were meant to be getting clean together and it just made me feel guilty. I relapsed yesterday and I’m stuck on whether to tell her or not. I think I’m nervous for her reaction because I don’t want her to be angry or disappointed, she is also an anxious person so she might end up blaming herself which would then mean I would have to explain exactly why I relapsed so that she doesn’t feel responsible and I don’t know if I want to talk about it in detail. We don’t live together, but are relatively sexually active, so chances are she’ll end up seeing them eventually. Part of me thinks she deserves to know but I’m just not sure if I have the energy for that conversation. Am I doing something wrong? Is relapsing something I’m expected to tell her about?",

    "title": "List of media about self-harm",
    "selftext": "Like many people with the same issue, I like to consume pieces of media about self-harm. Some are well done, some aren't. What I've noticed is that most of them only show white teenage girls facing this issue, so I've tried to list other examples.\n\n\\-\"Another Happy Day\" (Movie): This one basically falls into the white teenage girl trope, but it does it well. It's a story about a broken family coming together for a wedding and explores many serious issues, such as drug abuse, domestic violence and self-harm, in the context of family. The character who self-harms, Alice, shows up about halfway through the film, but she's mentioned before that. Things like childhood trauma in relation to self-harm are discussed. There's even an argument with a snarky relative who seems to be convinced that cutting is a new trend. Overall, I really like this movie, especially because my family is a lot like that portrayed in it, and I relate to Alice a lot. You can watch it on Prime Video.\n\n\\-\"The Beat Beneath My Feet\" (Movie): A representation of male self-harm! Wooh! The movie follows our main character, Tom, a shy, introverted teenager, as he works together with a disgraced rockstar to get over his stage fright for a talent show. The story is really sweet, and so is Tom, who is portrayed by Nicholas Galitzine. Tom has struggled with cutting in the past, but it isn't a main aspect of his character, which I like. We see his scars as his mother wants to see his arms to \"check on him\" and he relapses later in the story. This is one of the less heavy ones. I love this film, it's short and sweet and I really relate to Tom, as well. You can watch it for free on YouTube.\n\n\\-\"Sharp Objects\" (Series/Book): Sharp Objects is about a female crime reporter, Camille, who comes back to her home town after being released from a psychiatric hospital to investigate the murder of two girls. This is one of the heavier ones, and it has scenes of graphic self-harm, so you shouldn't watch/read it if you don't want to be triggered (sometimes you want to, I know). It has multiple characters who self-harm, but the focus is on Camille and how her dynamic with her mother as well as a SA experience in the past have influenced or even indirectly caused her self-harm. Again, this is heavy stuff. You can watch it on WOW, Amazon Prime and Apple TV.\n\n\\-\"A Little Life\" (Book): Alright, this is one of the bad ones, but it's actually enjoyable if you are aware of its badness. I'm reading it right now, and I'm underlining lines or paragraphs and writing stupid comments on the pages, and it's really fun. The back of the book says it's about the relationship of four men and how time changes their friendship or whatever, but it's actually about the comically miserable life of one guy called Jude, whom the entire friendship revolves around. Like, everybody in this book just cares about him and loves him and praises him to an unrealistic amount. I would give a more detailed description of the plot, but that's pretty much it. One guy suffers a lot and everybody cares. Oh, and he kills himself at the end. Sorry about the spoilers. I know a lot of people really like this book, and I'm interested in arguing my point more, so fight me in the replies, I can take it. You guessed it, the character who self-harms is Jude, and there are very graphic scenes of him doing it. Please, PLEASE do not read this book if you are at risk of suicide, get triggered by discussions of sh or SA or have good taste.\n\n\\-\"American Horror Story: Murder House\" (Series): I have mixed feelings about this one. I like the series overall, but the self-harm is not only stereotypical (depressed white teenage girl), but also very graphic. The character who does it, Violet, was very popular on Trumblr in the 2010's, for obvious reasons. So was her ghost school shooter-boyfriend Tate, played by Evan Peters. He is also implied to have cut himself when he was still alive. For anyone not familiar with American Horror Story, each season has a different concept (\"Asylum\", \"Covern\", \"Freak Show\",  ...), but they all have basically the same actors and play in the same universe. Murder House is about a family moving into a murder house. Yeah. The good thing about this series is that you can watch the seasons out of order, so if you're not into graphic self-harm and Trumblr-esque monologues about how much life sucks, I would recommend Hotel (my favourite season), Freak Show or Coven. The whole show is available on Disney Plus.\n\n\\-\"Ginny and Georgia\" (Series): I haven't actually watched this show, but apparently one of the main characters, Ginny, struggles with self-harm. I can't judge how well this is portrayed, but I hear that it's well done. Though I also hear that the show overall is bad, so I don't know. I think it's a Netflix series. (Of course it is!)\n\n\\-\"Degrassi: The Next Generation\" (Series): This is a mixed back for me. Degrassi is a low concept, long form, ensemble show, so it's not worth it to watch the whole thing just to get some presentation, but the single episodes are pretty comprehensible on their own. So, one character, Ellie, starts cutting herself in the episode \"A Whisper to a Scream\". It's about her life, her father being in the army and her mother being an alcoholic, and how much she struggles because of it. I like some parts of it, but others are questionable. I, personally, don't like the fact that Degrassi gave its sh plot to the female white goth character, but that's not wrong, necessarily. They get some of the \"anatomy\" wrong (how deep she cuts vs how her scars look, etc.), but that's forgivable. But the plot just seems weird to me. She starts cutting herself in the school bathroom at one point, not in one of the stalls, but next to the sink. Of course, someone walks in. She starts and stops within a few weeks, one or two months, at most. So, yeah. You can watch the episode on YouTube for free. I also know that there are some sh plots in the later seasons, one of them being given to a trans guy, for example, which I like, but I'm not that far yet.\n\n\\-Bonus: I really like Twenty One Pilots, just as a band, but they also have some songs about self-harm. As far as I know, both members have struggled with self-harm in the past, but are mostly clean now. (The drummer's scars have even almost completely faded, and I get really happy when I see a new picture of him because of that.) A few examples of songs discussing/mentioning/alluding to self-harm would be \"Cut My Lip\", \"Car Radio\", \"Fake You Out\" and \"Nico and the Niners\". (Some good songs to cry to at night: \"Neon Gravestonen\", \"Anathema\", \"A Car, A Torch, A Death\", \"Kitchen Sink\", \"March To The Sea\", \"Oldies Station\")\n\nSorry for any spelling mistakes, it's late at night and I'm dissociating while writing this. If you have read all of this and know any more good examples, please write a reply because I am always searching for new media to consume since escapism is what's keeping me alive right now.\n\n",

They got mad at me for it and said \"Do i have to glue you to my hip? You can't handle yourself? You can't be emotionally mature?\" I just wanted the yelling and the screaming and the threats to stop so i just said i said that for attention not because i really meant it.\n\nNow Im 15 and actually practice it and I won't ever tell anyone i'm close to. Or anyone who can ruin my life.\n\n I had a close call once, when i cut myself and blood was on the toilet seat, door handle and faucet and floor. Just tiny drops, and my sister asked where it was from. I just said i nipped myself accidentally trying to get hairs out of my razor.

My parents kicked out my brother when he was my age after they found out he was gay, if they find out im a lesbian they would do the same to me. after this entire incident, i went to my room and cried so hard and relapsed after trying to stay clean. having my parents sit me down and basically say \"you're not real, you're just mentally ill, confused, and living in a life of sin. we hate you\" was the last straw. i already hate myself so having someone say \"yeah i hate you too\" makes me want to kill myself (thanks for reading <3)",

I said oh I don’t really care about it she said. Mm…. Like okay? I was in the Walmart with her I said ma what did you wanna be when you were a teen? She said I don’t know. I said I wanna be Victoria secret super model Adriana Lima! She said oh okay! You’re gonna need some coco butter to cover up them scars. Mind you in the MIDDLE OF WALMART… then she asked why’d I look like I was about to cry like what?

She doesn’t care when I have panic attacks in front of her, when I’m having seizures in front of her, when I collapse to the floor while my vision is black(she says I’m copying my sister), or when I tell her I’m in pain and can’t go out, because I’ll ”use it as an excuse so video games can be played and not be caught with”. I tell her that I feel like vomiting when eating food, she gets me CBG, which is used to increase appetite. I had an appetite and she makes me have a larger one, when it wasn’t my problem.\n\n\n\n She unhooked the HOUSE PHONE so I couldn’t call someone I trust because it “costs too much”, yet she tells me to talk to people I trust when I’m feeling suicidal. I told her that I had called my friend because I almost killed myself and she turned it on me, saying “you always use suicide as a form of threat. Can’t take away the internet, you’ll kill yourself. Can’t take away devices, you’ll kill yourself. Can’t take away music, you’ll kill yourself.“ Like, I’m sorry for having a good mental health and lack of trust due to your manipulation and abuse since I was born? I’m sorry I’m ‘the cause we’re gonna get divorced‘(something my mother said)? What do you want me to do? Be able to fall asleep the instant I lie down like my father does and fall asleep in five minutes? I have insomnia, and you don’t give a shit about it because ‘it’s too expensive’ despite being free due to PeachCare. You just don’t want to believe your mistake and problem child has mental problems? Ok then. Fuck you, “Mother”.\n\n  \nDidn't give a shit when I was being sexually assaulted by Q\\_\\_\\_\\_(won’t say the name cuz privacy, but it’s my cousin who’s two and a half years younger than me and a girl). Didn’t give a shit when I got raped… once by man, and once a woman. Didnt give shit really when I was taking 350-400mg of Benadryl almost every day. Didn’t care when I sprained my wrist(multiple times) or broke my thumb. Didn’t care when I was beginning my hypersexual curse at 8 and am still hypersexual, almost to the dangerous kind to myself. You didn’t want to get me help any of those times, INCLUDING when I was literally shivering from how many cuts I did and how deep I did them, then got told to bleed out by both parents and got called an attention seeker for thinking my father would help me bandage instead of staring at me and giving me tips like “just stop cutting”. It is a FUCKING ADDICTION. Due to the CPS thing you had to sign, I could just kill myself and both you to prison for child abuse and child neglect. You fucking assholes really don’t realize that anytime I heard arguing when I was younger, I thought it was my fault, and then wished to fucking die and make it better. My attempt when I was 10 should have worked. Maybe then you two would be normal humans and not tell your kids “if you want to go to a mental hospital, we’ll send you to one.“ any time they felt like dying, I would’ve liked you. You didn’t care when my SISTER had drank enough Tylenol to kill herself, but you care if I have a single drink. You two ruined my life.

    "selftext": "I’ve been told it’s a form of OCD but I don’t think I have it. It seems more like behavior that falls under OCD. Or maybe I just don’t think so because I don’t pay much attention to my actions but now that I think about it (self-harm) aside, some of the stuff that’s important to me doesn’t seem important to others and takes so much of my time because I’m a perfectionist and that sort of ties into this.\n\nAnyways, like the title says, whenever something good happens to me like spending the day with my family or friends and having a good day, I get paranoid that something bad will happen. Maybe I manifest it but I swear it always follows the same process.\n\nSomething good happens —> something horrible happens.\n\nI recall having multiple good days then it being followed by something bad happening to my family members like sickness. I once had an amazing day and came home to my grandmother lying face flat on the floor.\n\nThat’s why I maintain average days most days besides the fact that I have nothing going on in my life anyways. Neither good nor bad. Actually, it’s better if I have bad days because I imagine that fate would give me a break. \n\nI get so angry sometimes. Why is it like this? Is there a higher being that wants to keep me in line?\n\nThat’s why I think there’s a spiritual aspect to this. I’ve always hated religion because of how enforced it was on me and I’ve found the religious people in my life only abused me or unhelpful because they relied too much on something intangible. Maybe I’m being punished. That’s what I thought.\n\nI turned back to religion, stopped making jokes I used to find funny but would often religious people, started praying, started thanking God and stuff, started wearing a medallion.\n\nBut that’s just recent because of a horrible incident with my father that still scares me so I went back to religion. Idk maybe it’s a comfort thing.  I’ve always self-harmed. \n\nI wrote about this before here. I’m so paranoid that every time something good happens to me and I actually feel happy (temporarily of course because all happiness is fleeting), I have to cut to avoid it being followed by something bad. \n\nNow that everything around me seems to be falling apart financially, health-wise, and in my personal life, there’s so many secrets and things I don’t know. I’m filled with anxiety that threatens to overflow and I can only do so much to suppress it. Not even maladaptive daydreaming can interfere when I’m dreading something. The things I once knew have changed and everything is so uncertain. I’m terrified. I feel like I have to do more. \n\nI don’t think I can be convinced of any other option or that my beliefs aren’t real and my system isn’t either because I’m so afraid that stopping might result into something big and bad happening. I’m afraid to test it. ",

She told me to grab a rope and hang myself up. I still remember that day. \n\nI also remember her constantly telling me no one would love if I weigh so much or eat so much. That human bodies don't even need much food. She would put me on diets that no one else in the family has to go through.\n\nShe would often throw furniture, she broke her phone to pieces, hit me and my sister with a thick wooden stick (similar to a police baton). It hurt to see her ruthlessly beat my sister when she was only 3-4 years old, although she did so without the stick. \n\nToday, she strangled herself over and over when she found out about my sh relapse. She told she'd cut her wrist and kill herself if I do it again. She kept telling that, and started scratching her skin infront of me, threatening to start cutting. Of course she didn't stop trying to choke herself. I felt like it was all my fault. \n\nI want my mom to die so bad. But I don't want the blood to be on me. If she strangles herself to death, it'd be because I made her to after my relapse.\n\nI was clean for 25 days, almost a month. I workout, eat healthy, stopped binge eating, studied hard, sacrifced my mental health, took care of my sister, gave people money, did people's work, and I've been there for everyone in the family. But she tells me I'm the most selfish person because I only sacrificed my blood and got anemia, instead of also crushing my bones and selling my organs. One day, I'll put myself in the black market. Maybe then, I'll actually be of use. ",

They saw my arm, they heard about the shit I went through at my school, the teacher who sexually harassed me, everything. The vice principal somehow knew about this and called my mother to school, pointing out a scar. Before I even knew this, my mom had suddenly started becoming suspicious about me asking me to show her my arm out of the blue. I managed to lie my way out of it and tell her it's the cat I always play with at school. She never liked that cat. She bought it, and a while after, I found out that the vice principal was behind all of that. (My mother nearly finding out). I was so fucking devastated I hated my life. And I still do, for instance. I told my mother about the thoughts of suicide I've been having, and she told me to go kill myself because \"people who are fucked up in the head cannot be helped. No doctor or medicine can help them.\" I told the school that I wanted this topic to completely end and that we would never speak about it ever again since my mother would not let me talk to them. That's what I told them. And they promised me they'd end this. they also promised me the principal wouldn't heat about this because she is strict as a motherfucker and she had once slapped a girl and humiliated her in front of the entire fucking school at the morning lineup. She took a picture of my other friend's arm, who also cuts herself. I swore I'd never let her know. Today is the last day of school, I thought I'm finally gonna have some peace of mind. Guess what? Nope. The principal confronted me. I got so fucking scared that my chronic rhinitis went bye-bye and unblocked the fuck out of my nose (at least that's one good thing that came out of this whole shit of a situation.) She knows everything. I don't understand. They swore on God, and we are in a Muslim country, swearing on God falsely is a major sin. The principal was sincere about it and I was shocked, it was too good to be true tbh. She wanted to bring a professional psychiatrist to school to help me (and my friend who's also dealing with the same) out of this. She promised she wouldn't tell my mother. So many promises. So many fake promises. And so many people who broke the genuine trust I had in them, I don't know what to believe or who to believe any more, I don't know what I should do.

So really, I just pop in my earbuds and do it in the isolation of my bathroom. \n\nIt's 5:30 am, I need to leave for work in about an hour. I've slept two hours tonight, I'm tired but not tired enough to turn off my brain and sleep. Today is gonna be rough as I have to go to work, then to a marriage counseling appointment, then to the gym. I'm already exhausted by just the thought of it. \n\nThere's plenty of reasons to stay here, but sometimes all I can focus on are the bad things and it makes me wish I had the nerve to end things. I've attempted twice, and I wish both times worked. Instead I'm stuck working to pay bills, in an OK marriage, with no dreams or energy to even try and attain one. \n\nI feel like I'm starting to get bad again, but there's nobody to help me on that except for me. I don't believe in myself though, so I'm nervous where this is all leading too. ",

However, it feels like every community I find is just an echo chamber of people venting without any real mutual help being shared. Venting is fine, but I want to make friends and start a healing journey, not just sit in an internet pool of other people's misery, if that makes sense. Does anyone have any advice or places they've found that might avoid this? Thanks. \n\nHonestly, im pretty close to starting my own community as I have a fairly decent fanbase on youtube (11k subs). But i feel that would only result in me having some sort of implicit power dynamic over the rest of the group since they would all be my fans, which is the last thing I want.",

I told her about it a couple time that I wasn’t doing well and she’d always ask if she can help and that she was there for me but this is the fist time I’ve been in a relationship and been this bad  mentally at the same time, normal time alone so I just deal with it by myself and it doesn’t effect anyone else. Last night was bad, I got new and sharper blades form what I was using so I had cut deeper then I had been wich isn’t very but still and when I get like this I tend to over think everything like every interaction I have with someone I’ll over analyze it and point out all my flaws. I did this last night wich had a play into me relapsing but It made me question weather my gf liked me or not so I asked her and I fear I shouldn’t have cuz it got us in a weird not nanas but not good conversation about it. She said she did still like me but then whent on to say she wasn’t sure if It was good for me to be in the relationship wich from my perspective just makes me question more on if she wants to be together. Us being together isn’t the reason I am so unwell rn there are any things that have been adding up since I graduated in the spring but I don’t want to make her feel like she has to stay or has to take care of me cuz I am so unwell but I don’t want her to leave either.

A constant need to relapse even if most days it’s bearable, it’s just a constant hum. Some days it becomes more noticeable and the frequency becomes one that makes me want to dig out a blade and slash across my chest.\n\nIt’s one thing to not feel safe around myself. It’s one thing to not feel safe in the town I live in. It’s one thing to not feel safe in Texas. But it’s another thing to not really feel safe anywhere in this country anymore.\n\nSome days the dysphoria is bad enough on its own. Some days I can barely look at myself in the mirror or look at myself at all. All I see is a girl. All anyone around me sees is a girl. All the country sees is a girl. So what’s that point, you know? What’s the point in preserving and keeping a body I hate safe and sound?\n\nAnd on top of that you have to add mental illness. Delusions. Like, “people are watching everything I do/guilt paranoia” or “im not actually the person who this body belongs to. im just keeping it functioning for them” or “im actually my 12 year old self”. Then the mood swings. Breaking down and sobbing one minute and having a fuzzy memory and being fine seconds later.\n\nI just can’t. I feel so hopeless. Hope is all I have. Hope that bad things won’t happen to me. Hope that I won’t have another episode. Hope that I won’t do something stupid. Hope that I will stay me.\n\nBut what’s the point if people don’t care about trans people? And least the majority. Old friends sacrificed my well being in order to support a man who wants to eradicate my existence. To make me not be safe anymore. All over fucking sports haha. Sports matter soooooo much more than your friends these days!!\n\nI had hope of getting on T. Of getting top surgery one day. And I still hold on to a sliver of it because it’s really the only thing that can give me something to look forward to in regards to living in a body I hate and want to shred to itty bitty pieces till I’m just a human clump of flesh.\n\nI wish I could cut myself in front of every bigot. Show them a “real mentally ill person”. Be the crazy fucker they fear. But I know that would just be counterproductive and I would probably get myself shot.\n\nI just want to crawl out of my body and be okay. Be safe. I’m so glad I at least have my mom to support me being trans. I know many people don’t have that luxury and to them I give you my support.\n\nI love y’all.

From young age (about 12 or 13) i was mentally and emonationaly abusing myself to the point where i was thinking about injuring myself (i've always been too scared to so anything seriouse). I have never thought that selfharm was even mind-best thing, i was purposefully downing myself, getting into stressful situations, heartbreaks and ect. Now im going through a rough time bcs im finishing school in my country and im really struggeling with my emotions. I have never been to therapy or anything like that. I coped with pain using sports and working out, to the point of throwing up and blacking out. Im confused, scared and numb about everything. I don't know what to do or how to feel, i dont know how to react to certain situations or moments in my life. And might wanna ask if i should tell my parents, im scared cuz i know they care and that they would take it up on themselves. \nThx, i needed to vent out a little bit.",

    "selftext": "for the past 4 years, I’ve had the habit of going to sleep between 1am-4am. Around this time last year, I experienced a major depressive episode and was suicidal. During this time, i stayed up until 6 or 7 AM on my phone doing random shit and then would sleep all day and miss my classes. This went on for months.\n\nSince then my depression was better for awhile, but now I’m worried it’s coming back—the past couple of days have been getting bad again. I’ve stayed up till 7am every night and woken up around 1 pm. I sort of see it as a form of self-harm/self-destruction. I have sleep medication that works, but I hardly ever take it. I know I could just take it at 10pm and be asleep by 12, but I just don’t. I purposefully harm my health, and lack motivation to stop. I think I am also addicted to my phone which doesn’t help. \n\nI have major depressive disorder, adhd, and general anxiety disorder which I am medicated for. However I still have horrendous time management skills from adhd which causes me to lose track and procrastinate on tasks. I’m a college student and often pull all nighters to complete projects. I have 9am classes this semester as well as night time classes, so this is not sustainable. I need to be able to wake up early for class and get my work done during the day. \n\nI’m really worried because I am graduating in the spring and need to fix my sleep problem to be a functioning adult in society with a career. I also have a 9am class the day after tomorrow that I need to go to. Any tips or advice would be helpful, thank you lol ",

And then while it’s healing I will brush my fingers over where I’m hurt and just stare at it, especially if it’s in a place that I had been having urges to cut myself.\n\nIt helps with the urges too. Like, keeps them a little at bay even if it’s something that is not in any way close to what I would normally do (for the time at least, like I said, been almost a year now).\n\nAnd I’ll even fantasize about getting hurt real badly. Like, I’ll have little daydreams about falling, having something bad happen to me, accidentally slice myself open on something, stuff of that sort. And I always get a little excited when I do. Idk, being clean has been messing with me the last couple days with everything going on in the US right now, especially as a transman haha.\n\nAnd I dunno. I don’t even fully know why I’m writing this. Probably to see if anyone else does the same since I don’t have anyone to talk about this stuff to lol. But yeah. I guess there’s my silly rant.

All I was doing was relaying an experience and seeking help and support from others that I thought would understand. I suppose that the experience could be triggering for some, and maybe I was a bit too forward with my wording.\n\nAnyway, I just came from the local health clinic. I wanted a clear answer of whether or not I was just being crazy, and all the pain and symptoms were in my head. I was almost sure that I was pregnant and I had lost my baby. Basically, they said they couldn’t confirm nor deny my experience. They couldn’t say yes or no. They couldn’t even tell me that it was likely to have happened. They said the signs were technically there, but since I had likely only been about 2 weeks into my pregnancy, they wouldn’t be able to test or do an ultrasound or anything. The best they could do was literally “put a bandaid” on it. \n\nI’m so extremely torn about all of this. I’m confused. I’m hurt.

It dosent seem that long but it feels like forever. \n\nEver since I met him he’s told me that his license is suspended because his dad wracked up a whole bunch of fines while using his car.\nHe said it’s only suspended for 3 months and it had already been a bit before we met.\n\nFrom the first date I was driving us everywhere which was okay- shit happens I get it. The months pass and sometimes I’d press when he was getting it back and he’d shrug me off saying he hadn’t received a letter from the government saying it was ok to drive again. \n\nI asked to see his license photo on his license because mine was pretty goofy. He told me he’d lost it. \n\nI asked him if he’d passed his driving test first try and he said he had. He’d say things like he couldn’t wait to get his license back. \n\nBy now I’m getting a little stressed because I was driving us everywhere. Whenever he wanted to go and get food or go somewhere I was driving us. When he needed me to pick him up something I did it. \n\nWhen he wanted to see me I’d have to drive over to his house. I’ve spent a lot of time and money driving around. And not to mention lots of fuel which I don’t exactly have the money for.\n\nI drove us two hours away up to his mums place for Boxing Day ($50 worth of tolls on the highway) and back again.\n\nBut I thought it would be okay since he’d have his license back soon and the driving would be halved (not to mention I could finally be a passenger every now and then)\n\nI did it all because I love him.\n\nHe lied for 3 months. Spun lies and made up scenarios. \n\nTwo days ago he confessed to me. \n\nThat he’d actually had his licence back the whole time, since before we’d met even. And that he actually didn’t have his provisional licence (never even went for it) so he can’t actually drive by himself like he led me to believe.\n\nHe said he was embarrassed and didn’t want me to think less of him.\n\nNow I’m just torn up. At the realisation that this is how it will be for a long time. Me being relied on to go anywhere and everywhere. Even when I’m sick or have a headache if he’s hungry we go.\n\nI’m cutting bad again. Deep styros into my stomach that gape and need glue. He dosent know. And I can’t tell him. \n\nBut the situation won’t change. I’ve been betrayed and now I’m relapsing bad and I can’t stop it.\n\nFor once I just wish he could come over and see me. I just want him to take care of me for once.\n\nInstead I drive over to his place in pain from my cuts and take us to get food and smile. I’m clean I say. I don’t cut anymore.\n\nHe dosent know a thing.",

Until now. I can’t get over my ex boyfriend, and he got a new girlfriend (I found out today). Its a small town, I go to the same school as she.\n\nIn the past I always cut because i was depressed, but now I cant even feel anything except anger and pain. I angry with myself, him and her. I miss him, I want him to be with me, but he already moved on and I am stuck. I fought for my life for over a year, and I finally thought that I can be happy and I found myself again. But after him, I found myself at the same place again.\n\nI hate myself because I relapsed, I feel like i dropped all of the things i did for my well being. I can’t cry, I just sit in my room and do nothing all day again. I thought I finally grow out self harm, I am 18 now and I feel like i too old for this. \n\nI dont actually know what I expect from this post, maybe i just needed to vent",

I also sent him an inappropriate picture of myself to the ex while I was in the relationship. Another major reason is I went out for like 30mins (with one of my girlfriends) to see a friend of mine who came to visit without telling my boyfriend. He found out in a stupid way and is mad about me lying. Now to the problem, after numerous tried to break up with me and me crying hysterically to not do it, we agreed he would give me 1 month to prove the relationship is not lost and I can make him happy again. Yesterday he got mad at me for something really small (remembering when me and my ex got together but struggling to remember when me and him did) and he is sure he now wants me to stop all contact with him unless he reaches out first and after the 1 month agreement is over he can break up with me in peace. I have been feeling so ill these past few days, started doing sh and constantly be lightheaded on some local herbal antidepressants. I take like 10-15 a day. I want to end up in there hospital or atleast him to notice how hurt I am and how much I want him but I'm not sure if that will bring him back or push him even further. I'm not scared of any other consequences I just feel guilty and like I'm blackmailing him I just wish for him to trust me again. I can't think or do anything besides thinking about either him, pills or razor. I ordered some stronger meds today too and a gift for him. Should I have hope or try something different because I am NOT giving up on this guy don't even suggest it",

I always thought that my first vacation without parents would be with her. Even though we didn't have any agreements on that, I just always assumed that. That's why it makes me sad, sorry if that didn't make any sence. \n\nIm 7 months clean now. But, it has happened again. This time she went to Tokio, with that same friend. The weird thing is, we haven't planned anything together. The last time I saw her, she asked about if I had any vacation plans either alone or with my sister, but she didn't mention anything about a vacation with me and her. I don't understand why she doesn't go on vacation with me. So this whole situation has me triggered. I really want to self harm.

I can't break apart from everyone else now since I run indoors for everything (tempos, recovery, long runs) and I tend to take off my shirt as well since it gets really hot and the ventilation isn't that good. it boosts my performance significantly as well.\n\npeople are obviously gonna see my cuts and scars because we're all packed on treadmills, and I can't just wear long sleeves or whatever while running. I'll also have a problem during track meets since obviously all I have to work with is a jersey and tight shorts that are slightly forgiving since they end just above the first cut on my thighs. heats are small with like 6 or 8 people usually, so people will obviously focus in and my cuts and scars will be even more obvious.\n\nhow do I hide these cuts without sacrificing performance?? I have cuts on my upper arm near my shoulder ares and on the back of my forearms. is there like some sort of makeup or anything else I can do to hide cuts and scars? has anyone else had some sort of experience like this even for another sport? please help!!!",

Now I’m worried about how long it’ll take to heal. Completely covered 5x7cm of my ankle, mostly epidermis and dermis cuts. It’s been 1 - 1 1/2 weeks, they’re all scabbed now, I put steri strips on the gaping ones (up to 3mm) because I know from experience it’ll 100% take too long to heal if I didn’t. I’m doing everything I can to promote healing by disinfecting, putting on bandages and lotion, not picking at the scabs etc. The community guide estimates 2-4weeks for dermis cuts but I’m worried it’ll still be very visible. They’re still all scabbed after 1 1/2 weeks, even the light ones, the deeper ones look like they’ve got a long way to go (just removed the steri strips today). Not sure if my previous sh increases healing time, I often feel like it’s the case cause even wounds from mosquito bites leave a mark there for weeks\n\nI’ll definitely put makeup on during the event but even make-up can only do so much and the scabs have to be gone for that - and I absolutely don’t want my extended family to know I’ve got “issues”. I’ve thought about getting a waterproof ankle bandage but I’m scared the hotel won’t allow that in the water and if they don’t I’m kinda fucked. Atm I’m also sick, no idea if that will change anything about the healing process\n\nFrom your experience: Will it heal in time? What else can I do to promote healing?",

At the time of meeting I was 15, he was in his mid 30s and it lasted about a year. I don’t really have any negative feelings about it. Like, year I know it shouldn’t have happened, I know it was wrong, blah blah blah all that stuff.\n\nBut when I cut him off, after a few months I started essentially whoring myself out to predators online. Which in all honesty it’s kinda crazy to have so many people in my DMs after a single post. Makes you think especially since after a bit of time talking to them they sound like they appear as normal people, which I guess is how it works idk.\n\nI tend to have moments of hypersexuality or delusions where doing that kinda stuff feels like a requirement. Like how a couple months ago I felt like I was actually a child stuck inside my body and felt a need to do bad things. Have people tell me all the bad things they would do to me. Encourage negative behaviors. Which, yeah, creepy to have happened (which is why nobody irl knows yayyy!!)\n\nLike, it will just be this all consuming thing. And then out of nowhere I will go from being “Please tell me to cut myself and that I’m a whore” and act like that kinda guy to being completely sex repulsed. Start to repress those memories and feelings, be scared, and then return to how I am normally which is a 16 year old guy who is trying to be a better person and live a normal life.\n\nAnd it’s just been messing with me a bit, especially since I have such a difficult time remembering or even understanding why I would ever do those things. Like, I did something similar to the before I was sexual with the man I mentioned earlier. The only explanation I can gather is that it’s me replacing one form of self-harm with another.

    "selftext": "I wanted to share my alternative mindset to being 'clean'. I consider myself 'in recovery' because I don't actively self harm.\n\nI always found counting clean days to be very triggering. It made me feel extra shitty any time I relapsed. It's important to understand that relapses *are not* starting over; any amount of time spent not self-harming is progress! But as much as I preach this, I couldn't get myself to fully believe it. It's easy to slip into the catastrophizing mindset of \"I've fucked up my progress\", especially in the moment.\n\nI prefer to think of myself as in recovery; I am actively working towards improving my mental health and finding new coping strategies. If I occasionally dip back into old coping strategies, ie. self harm, I can acknowledge it without guilt. I feel this keeps my head clearer so I can better identify my triggers for next time.\n\nIf counting clean days works for you, onya. But for those that find it difficult, perhaps this mindset would help.\n\nTL;DR: I don't like counting clean days. I prefer to look at my recovery as a whole. SH is a coping strategy; finding new coping strategies takes time. Be kind to yourself.",

    "title": "why is self harm considered to be bad?",
    "selftext": "stupid question I know, but seriously?\n\n\nim a teenager, I’ve been dealing with self harm since I was about 9 years old. I never understood why it was bad, and I still don’t. I get it in a sense that you don’t want people you care about to hurt themselves, and when I picture my friends or people I care about doing it, it upsets me. but when I do it, I don’t see it as bad and I hate how people worry. \n\n\n\nI have many scars on my arms, and they’re extremely noticeable. I’ve had a few friends on occasion notice them and confront me about them, but obviously they were just worried. I understand their worry, but it just annoys me that people care. I don’t want them to pity me or look at me any differently. \n\n\nI don’t know why I get worried at the thought of those I care about doing it compared to me, because not wanting them to hurt themselves sort of contradicts my justification of harming myself if that makes sense. I often fantasize about self harm being non-justifiable for everyone in the world but me, and I imagine it’s normalized for only me to do it so nobody cares nor worries about me and I can just cut myself in peace. I try to place myself in my friend’s shoes finding out that someone who they care about cuts themselves, and logically I understand the reason why people care but it’s hard for me to like actually fully accept that because my mind is clouded with the thought “why do you care if I hurt myself when it’s not hurting you nor anyone around me.” that’s another reason why I don’t get why self harm is considered bad. people only mainly care when you hurt others around you, not yourself. so why does it matter now?\n\n\n\nI have no idea if this post makes any sense, I don’t even know how to put my thoughts and feelings into words since it’s such a complex thing to understand",

I made the most cuts I've ever done in one sitting alone through that and then it became kind of a sexual thing, but it was mixed with self abuse like I was just hitting myself over and over again, suffocating, choking myself just doing anything to feel something to raise my pain tolerance . as the Dom I would say hurtful things, but I just never could really understand what any of this was. I couldn't understand if this was self harm or me just doing self BDSM lol it got to the point where I would spend like a whole day doing it I couldn't even do anything else. I couldn't bring my mind to care about anything else and that low-key started to consume me in a way it kind of spilled into my real life. where i almost went through with something that couldve endangered me. it got to a point where i was just pushing my pain tolerance and trying to make myself tap out mentally like dissociate.i needed someone else to give me the pain someone stronger. i realized it was becoming too much and i stopped but ever since I've stepped back but now self harm like cutting it just doesn't hit that well for me anymore after I've experienced that BDSM dynamic.\n\nthere was a time that I had slapped myself so many times that it's almost like I disassociated and I couldn't even get up even when the dom was yelling at me to get up. I couldn't bring myself too. It's like my soul has left my body. i got addicted to that feeling.\n\nand another time when I was just choking myself, it almost felt like there was another person on top of me. I don't know what this is that I created with myself, but it feels powerful it takes over me. that made me seek an outer source for the pain.\n\noverall i just find myself confused overall with the dynamic and hesitant to engage with it again as i do believe it was subconsciously affecting me. i was also curious if anyone else has had similar experiences.\n",

I told myself that it was part of the healing processus, but a week after I did it again, and again, (three days ago). \nI don’t get it, I’m doing way better I may have sometimes my stomach hurting but not as bad as before, I have no outside problems, im enjoying my life.\nI promised myself that sh was only for when my stomach was aching very badly like before, i don’t get why I relapsed. And I’m even more ashamed of the fact that I want to keep doing it, I feel both relieved yet bad. \nI think that it may be because my previous scars are fading, I know I’m valid scars or not, but my self don’t feel valid at all, I feel like I want to have visible scars for myself to remember what I’ve been through.\nMonths ago, when I was clean, I told my mother about my scars etc. She was very sweet to me and understood me. But I don’t want to tell her about it anymore, I told her that I was healing yet I relapsed. My mom is someone very sweet, she herself dealt with a lot of problems when she was younger and I know that she felt extremely sad when I told her. \nI don’t know how I feel, it’s so weird. Sh both helps me to feel better but also makes me bad cuz sh is considered as bad. \nIf anyone is/has dealt with the same issue and could help me to know why I act like this, I would really be grateful. \nThank you again.",

I usually use my nails to break the skin but I had an urge to make a proper cut with something sharp. I had only planned to make one cut but I just kept adding more and now the front of my forearm is covered in cuts. They're not very deep so they shouldn't cause too many problems for me but it's mainly the fact that I wanted to cut myself without a reason. And I already knew that most of the time when I injure myself it's not because something's happened it's just because I wanted to and I like the feeling but this was just so much worse. When I do it with my nails, I think because it takes a long time to actually get a deep cut, I didn't notice it before. It's not usually a problem because I'm one of the lucky ones who doesn't really have anything wrong with them but just likes the feeling so i can choose not to self harm if I really wanted to but I like the feeling of bleeding. I went to a therapist for an unrelated reason before and she was kinda horrible so I don't want to go to therapy. I also just struggle with talking to adults one on one or being open with people really.\nLong story short: I like the feeling of cutting myself and I want to know whether I should go to a therapist or just try not to self harm. \n\nSorry for being a bother and thanks for any advice you might have.\n\n\nSmall update (not a positive one) \nSo I made more. Basically I had just gotten out of the shower and into my pajamas but my skin was still soft from the water. I looked at the knife I had used originally decided to reopen the cuts since it would be easier now and I didn't like how little they had bled. And I know that's bad on its own but then I just added a few more because the space on my arm was ''too empty'' and there was a voice that said I had to fill it. So I did. I started feeling ill (not from loss of blood, they aren't deep enough for that) and so I stopped but that was 10-15 minutes ago and I am still shaking and feeling ill. ",

    "selftext": "If you struggled with self harm and had an older sister, what would you want her to say or do? What would help? Please tell me, I am so lost.\n\n\n\nA little backstory: we both grew up with a mother that has narcissistic traits (we still live with her right now), our father passed away in 2016. We both have had mental health problems. When I was 18, I was suicidal and ended up spending 2 weeks at a mental hospital where I got help, I'm better now, though still dealing with anxiety and depressive episodes to this day. \n\nMy sister has gotten depressed these past couple years as well. A couple factors that contributed to her state: she’s now attending a highly competitive high school known for tough math and physics (they have daily tests, long hours, and intense academic pressure); she has had troubles in romantic relationships; and of course, we still live with our mom, so there is that.\n\nShe started doing self-harm around that time. **She is getting professional help.** Every time mom notices the cuts, she yells at her (\"you're getting help, why is nothing changing, am I spending all this money on nothing? Stop it, promise me you will never do it again\"). I defended my sister multiple times, I stood between them telling mom to leave her be, to be supportive, can't you see she's struggling? She would not shut up and go away or listen, it's insane, she can spend hours just complaining about this until my sister starts to shake and cry uncontrollably, after which she starts going on a \"look, you're literally crazy\" tangent. One day my sister slept in my room while I was guarding the door, so that mom doesn't come in. \n\nOverview of the current situation:\n\n\\- My sister developed sort of a defence strategy: any time mom talks to her now (any topic, even if it's normal conversation), she rudely tells her to leave, shut up, etc. \n\n\\- She can talk to me normally\n\n\\- She takes meds, only when reminded many times, otherwise she skips them\n\n\\- She has appointments with the mental health doctor every couple weeks\n\n\\- She can't go in a hospital like I did, this help is only available if you are 18+ here\n\n\\- She keeps cutting herself fairly often, I don't think there has been progress in over half a year of therapy, although I'm not expecting her to heal instantly, I'm just worried\n\n\\- She also takes pictures of it\n\n\\- Her boyfriend is trying to help her not self harm, but she is either passive agressive with him or apologising profusely? (I don't know what's going on here, I may be lacking context)\n\n\\- One day I asked her to do a chore, she snapped and said \"say thank you that I'm still alive\", from what I know she told her boyfriend she felt like one day she would kill herself. So that is something that is on her mind\n\n\\- Whenever anyone says any tiny thing that she doesn't want to hear (usually asking to do basic chores like turning off the lights when leaving the house, brushing the toilet after number 2, putting her clothes away) she ignores her way out of it or says \"yes of course\" and never does it, which is the same thing. I get that these things are hard when you are struggling with mental health though.\n\n\\- Sometimes she comes home late (11pm+), turns off her location on Life360, ignores calls and messages. Tells us afterwards she didn't hear it and was with her friends\n\n\\- In general, I try talking to her every day, not about the self harm but just asking what's new, telling her she can talk to me if there is anything, giving her my stuff/money if she needs any, etc. She only shares very basic information (i.e. \"had a test today\"), I don't want to pressure her into talking about anything she's not comfortable talking about, because I'm worried that might push her away. Out of personal things, she only once shared that her boyfriend cheated on her, and I told her that she deserves better, she deserves to be with someone who respects and cares about her (they are back together now, now all she says about him is how good of a person he is).\n\nI don't know. I'm trying to be supportive, but I feel like there is no connection between us. I have struggled with depression too, but self harmed only once before. So, as a concept, self-harm is foreign to me, I feel like I don't understand it completely. I don't understand my sister, I want to help though. I don't know what I might be doing wrong. Things are mostly awkward between us. We talk, but surface-level. I can feel she doesn't hate me, but that's about it. She keeps pushing everyone away.\n\nI don't know, this is hard, confusing, frustrating, I don't know what to do. Please help",

    "selftext": "So me and my boyfriend broke up, no biggie I guess. I stopped self harming because of him and now I have so many urges to do it again. \n\nI was 2 years clean and ever since we broke up I haven't been as happy I've been feeling so numb and everytime he doesn't acknowledge me it's like I am waiting for him to acknowledge me. \n\nDon't know if anyone knows how it feels but when I started dating him it was a life changing kinda thing for me and I changed completely but it was so hard to show love properly because of the previous relationship I was in but when it came to him I depended on him so much (since I was a freshman in highschool) and I didn't want to leave his side.  This lasted up until late 1st semester off my junior year. \n\nI started to think about cutting alot and my relationship with him was rocky because of how many arguments we had. I blame myself for thoes arguments and during our last moments of the relationship I tried to give solutions and even suggested a break but he was very easy to leave someone who he knew relied on him and needed him and was afraid of being left alone. He left easily and it didn't take him to long to feel better (at most a couple weeks) and he didn't look for another relationship. At this point no matter how much he told me how much he loved/liked/cared about me still I knew everything he would tell me was a excuse to not get me to self harm and he knew I was on the verge of turning to self harm. \n\nCurrently it's 2nd semester of my junior year and everything has been.. painful to say the least. \n\nHe doesn't care that the club he's in has my sexual harasser as the president and he managed to lie to almost everyone I was close to that I made it up (story for another time) but because of this I lost everyone. He didn't seem to care about how I felt towards this person at all and it was he was heartbreaking to say the least because he didn't care untill I physically showed how bad I didn't wanna be near my sexual harasser (I was shaking and crying and would hyper ventilate). He cared for a small moment untill he simply just acknowledged me and then make me 3rd wheel while I would follow him like a dog. He's told me to my face that even if I did something for him all I'd get is acknowledgement and that's it. \n\nAs of right now I'm waiting for one thing and one thing only from him. \n\nIf he wants to be together again. \n\nI asked him a while back and he said he did but didn't and he would tell me once he knew. \n\nI told him as long as I knew I was important I could be happy and I'd be okay but I've been feeling so betrayed and abandoned everytime he's left me alone. I don't wanna be selfish and stop him from being him but when he broke up with me I was afraid of being alone especially since the friend he leaves me with is so obsessed with me and he sees himself as my brother and me as his little sister. It's uncomfortable and he still suggests me to go with this person who I'm with 24/7. \n\nAt this point is it even worth not cutting for if he's gonna treat me like crap and abandon me anyways? If he says no I've been delaying the inevitable and if he says yes than I don't have to worry but has everything that has happened been worth it? To being someone's world to being told all I get is acknowledgement? Just for him to tell me to my face that that's all I'll ever get while he can call me a friend? I've been delaying this because I promised I wouldn't cut but I really can't handle the pain he causes me when I could be feeling numb every day instead of crying because he leaves me alone. Is it worth the wait?",

Before this my longest streaks were some where around 60 and 40. \nThis time I actually put some effort into getting clean. Threw my blades out, even the secret ones. That was so hard. I still miss them sometimes. Not necessarily them, but the fact that I could always go and grab them no matter what. It was a stable thing in my life. \n\nNow for the last few days I started craving that. I want this back. I miss it. I want to feel the power, the numbness, the high, the proudness, every sick feeling that I get when I look at my fresh scars. I miss it. I hate that I miss it. \n\nA couple of days ago my parents made a pretty snarky comment regarding the fact, that we don’t really speak any more (I have moved out more than a half year ago). That had sent me back around 4-5 years in time. \nThat was my absolute low. I hated everything and every moment of life was just too much. I feel that again. I feel that pain again. But now noting is similar to that part of my life. I’m not in high school, don’t live with them, or anything. Just these comments from my mom. \n\nWhy does she thinks this wont make things even worse? That I still want to see them even if she always gives me stomach ache for a week. \nI hate this, i just need to get some stress off. And I want to, but I can’t do this way. \n\nI miss the good part, since now I only got the guilt, shame, hiding, craving for more. \n\nI don’t know what to do, but I can’t give in, no matter how much better it would be for a moment.

I also generally don’t hid my scars or body at home since it’s too impractical \nI haven’t worn shorts outside in probably two years since the scars are on my calves too, and I haven’t worn a short sleeved shirt outside in probably longer than that.\n\nI’ve recently started trying to make friends, and my job is crazy people reliant so I’ve been noticing differences in myself to people. I can’t talk about myself in meaningful ways, i freak out and start feeling like I’m being threatened. \n\nI notice that people tend to really really like me, and it makes me feel like shit. I don’t feel like I deserve all of the love and appreciation my costumers give me- I’m faking it. I only act crazy over the top and bubbly for the tips. I feel like a dickhead. I want friends but anytime I start talking to people I feel myself start to switch into the work people pleasing version of me and I hate it so much. \n\nAnd recently, I did make a friend. Her name was A, and we hung out a few times. Then she changed in front of me and I noticed how scarless she was, and I couldn’t believe my eyes. I’d never felt ugly about my scars until seeing her smooth skin in person. I remember she asked me if I needed to change too(we had been at the lake) and I said no, because she’d never seen me outside of jeans and hoodie.  That was the last time we hung out because she was moving, but all I could think about the rest of the time I was there, was picturing what her reaction to my body might’ve been like, instead. Would it have been disgust, instead of how in awe I was of her skin???? Thinking about it makes me gag.\n\nI want to make friends, but I’m terrified of being friends or being close.

    "title": "I have a habit of self harm and want to get rid of it",
    "selftext": "I 25F am in a mess rn, whenever i was a kid i was beat up a coupon of times when i was kid. But that never stuck, the times i remember was when i was a teen, i was 13 when k had my first boyfriend and i was never a girl who was too exposed to such things but it all changed when a girl moved to us next door who was 15 and from other city. She has had multiple boyfriends before and the thought of boys was new to my teen mind. I started speaking t her guy friends and it was all innocent. Until i met this guy i had a crush on through Facebook and he was 6 years older to me but i was literally a kid and the fact that guy liked me back sent me over the moon. We met a couple of times and he was my first kiss and he bought me chocolates and flowers. It all changed when i was once with him and my parents were looking for me, i did not have a phone since his house was near mine. I understand how my parents were worried sick and i do regret that but what happened after is something i could never forget, as i reached home happy and smiling my parents went livid. They called up all my friends as i was gone for 45 minutes, they repeatedly asked me where i was and i was scared so i told them i was with a friend who lived nearby. My mother took me to her house to confront her with me by the side and she denied i was with her, then they pressed me and i told them about the guy and i did not do anything but they didn’t listen. They took me and the guy and both my parents drove to a gynaecologist for testing my virginity. Obviously nothing came of it and when we were going home my parents beat me up, I don’t remember much of it but i was grounded after that and not allowed to play out with my girl friends no matter who. I was not allowed to go out and i remember my mother used to put hair oil before sending me to school so i dress up decently, back then being a teen it was humiliating to have hair like that and other kids did make fun of it, i always did joke and laugh about it back then because i was too ashamed to cry about getting beat up. I was alone for a while and my parents didn’t speak to me for a few days and i did apologise. Afterwards everything went normal for a while.\nWhen i was 14 i made a fake Facebook profile to chat with my friends after school because i had nothing to do after school everyday, there was nothing to do and frankly that feeling of being free and then i started dating this guy who was a friend of the girl who moved next door he was from a distant state and we never met. And i don’t think it was dating, i we just spoke on call at night or whenever i was home alone. We met after a year of us dating for literally 5 minutes on side of a road and then i had to come home because i was out for an excuse of buying groceries. Then one day while i was in my room using laptop and was logged into my Facebook. My mother barged in and took it and my dad woke up, they saw my Facebook messages and all. I was beat up again and my mother cut my hair which were shoulder long from one side till my ear as a mark to get me a bob cut next day but i had school so i just pinned up my hair and they weren’t looking half bad. I apologised and things went to normal.\nA similar incident happened when i was 15 and there was a spare phone in the house which i used to talk to this guy who was the same age and liked me, we met twice only but i got caught again and got beat up again, this time my dad hit me with a belt and the buckle hit my head and i remember it was slightly bleeding. I did see the blood in my hands and even my mother saw it but she just said stop being dramatic i saw it and it’s nothing, just go to sleep. Next day in my school i was around my classmates and a friend of mine hit my head from behind and it hurt she did ask me what happened and i told her about it, a couple more of my friends asked me to go to the infirmary and i went where the teacher asked me what happened. I lied and told her i fell from stairs and  hit my head, she called up my parents as i did need stitches according to her. When my mother came to pick me up she had a meeting with my principal and told everything, my principal ‘suspended’ me for a week to stay home and i was usually isolated to my room with no gadgets but something good did come out of it, I started reading. It was a novel in my room which j issued from school library and i read it within days and i know it was a minor thing but it is something i enjoy doing a-lot. It opened my imagination and to this day i love getting lost in books and reading.\n\nAfter a week i went to school again I apologised and things went normal, some few more incidents like this happened but the beating was less now. I i don’t know but whenever things like this happened i used to just stay silent, cry for a while and then the feelings were numb. My looks were average in my teen years and they i did get attention from guys, i know I should’ve learned but the defiance felt like freedom. I secretly dated guys and whenever i had a heartbreak i cried alone in my room without letting a soul know how bad i was hurting, not even my closest friends, which now i realised i did not have any back then. I was a happy and extrovert kid but could never ever cry or be sad in front of anyone no matter how much i was hurting. I remember being close to my younger brother when i was a kid who is 5 years younger to me, but i remember my mother asking me to stay away from him as i might ruin him aswell and so i did. I eventually made some very close friends at 18 and moved out for college, they live in different cities but i go to them whenever i have an issue or something wrong going on in my life. I am good with my family and i don’t hold grudges or feel sorry for myself because there are people out there with actual suffering and I am really good at repressing my feelings. But still i cannot be vulnerable with anyone, i am dating this guy rn 27M from past 4 years, we met on Facebook and were just friends until 4 years back when we reconnected and i never have been happier with anyone else than i am with him. \nMy problem is whenever i feel i screwed up i hit myself, i only did that twice last year and today. Idk why but i feel like i deserve it. It is mostly punching, slapping or pulling my hair which i don’t wanna do but i cannot stop but hurt myself. Just like i used to do in my childhood, i get in a blanket cry and forget about it. My boyfriend is a very nice man and he doesn’t deserve this, i love him more than anything, have always been loyal to him. But deep down i feel i am broken and am meant to be alone, i wanna be with him but i don’t think i deserve that. Plus he is rich and comes from a family where he was listened to and he can share everything with his parents, whereas my parents are the last people i go to when i am in trouble. It’s not that they don’t care or won’t help but i cannot get myself to talk to them about anything personal or emotional. And no hate to my parents because they did raise me to be an independent individual and they put me through med school, i know their ways were tough but i am self sufficient and they worked really hard in life to get me where i am rn.\nWhen it comes to my boyfriend I feel like a misfit in his life, he has everything sorted and fine. Whereas i am still in college (last few months left) and i have no idea what ill do after that, i wanna do my post grad from a college in his state as he lives 4 hours from my place, but i am not sure i would get into it. I feel worthless sometimes and that feeling of never being good enough no matter what never leaves me. He has been kind, loving and patient to me but sometimes i wonder, till when? What if a day comes a realises he could do much better and be with someone who matches his status and then i would be left alone again. I am sorry for this long post and rambling so much but i am tired of this pain and hurt, i do feel if i am alone nothing can hurt me. I have friends and speak to alot of people but i have never felt seem or heard until i stated dating him and now i feel i don’t deserve it.",

Maybe derealization, I'm not entirely sure. \n\n\nStarting off with some honesty. I despise myself. I feel nothing but hatred for my body and mind and existence. A lot of the time I feel subhuman to the point where it is genuinely painful to exist inside my skin. I have been dehumanized viciously by people all my life to the point where I cannot feel anything but lesser than. I self harm because I hate myself and because the ways that people have treated me in the past makes me resentful and I have no way to take out this anger than on myself. I have a terrible aversion to touch after numerous events earlier in my life and bleeding is the only thing that beings me comfort and relief from the constant skin crawling feeling. \n\n\nI yearn for recognition to a point that is unhealthy. I have been going through hell for as long as I can remember and all I really want is for someone to care. Yea, I mainly self harm for pain but it is also absolutely because I want attention and I will not even try to deny it. I was someone, anyone, to see how much I'm hurting and to care because I have been so completely lost and void for so many years. I want to be reminded that I am a person even if I don't feel like one, but people see right through me. I got desperate and texted the suicide hotline last night but instead of being able to talk to a person I was asked numerous questions about my history of self harm and suicide. Maybe I'm being dramatic (lol probably) but it felt wildly dehumanizing. Who in the right mind wants to recount all their traumatic experiences when they texted this number for HELP. Ugh, I'm so pissed to the point where the experience ironically only made me want to hurt myself more. \n\n\nI know this is going to kill me someday, whether intentionally or not, this level of bodily harm is not sustainable and I find some comfort in that. Like many people I know, the degree of the harm I have done to myself over the years has increased with time. I am a vindictive person, I see death as a way to get back at the people I dislike. I hope that it haunts them, I want them to feel bad, even if only momentarily, as awful as that sounds. \n\n\nI am a bad person and for this reason I know I deserve what I've done to myself but a part of me can't help feeling that maybe if things had gone differently I would be a  better person by now. I'm jealous of people with support systems and stability and living mothers. I'd give anything to see my mom again, she's the only person who ever made me feel like I was anything at all. Without her I have no reason not to self harm, or any reason to live at all. I wanted to help her but I was too late, and for that I feel like this suffering is kind of deserved. I know realistically there's nothing I could have done, but grief is not rational and I miss her so desperately. I still remember the first time she saw my scars. She didn't say anything, just opened her arms and I fell into them sobbing my eyes out. She told me she was sorry and that she wished she could protect me from the world. I miss her. \n\n\nThank you for listening to the rambles of some childish college student. I hope life treats you all well and that you know you are worthy and deserving of love and kindness. I hope the world treats you more gently. ",

I know this sounds like attention seeking but that’s really what a needed, attention. I just needed someone to ask me how i was and if i had done it again. I did need attention. The problem is that at first it didn’t even believe myself. i’m not sure how to explain but i strongly believed i ONLY did it for attention. It got bad when i stopped telling people about it but kept it going. That’s when i figured i actually liked the feeling and craved it even. The internal pain is so bad sometimes it’s so relieving to feel it outside. I stopped a couple years after i started. Although, i never rlly stopped harming myself. I’m harming myself is invisible ways. I pick at my lips and skin like crazy, and i barely eat anything because i would rather my stomach hurts than eat something i don’t feel like eating. Recently i’ve literally been having flashbacks like you could see in a movie. Flashbacks of harming my skin until it bleed, and i wanna do it SO bad. I’m trying so hard not to because i know if i start again i won’t be able to stop it. It’s always “just one more cut” “one more won’t make a difference” but it does make a difference. I know it won’t be only one. I wanna do it so bad i can’t stop thinking about it. And it’s not about the pain it makes me feel, bc tbf i hate pain. It’s the action of doing it. I can’t describe it but it’s a feeling of relief and peace and calm. I’m so torn i just wanna cry. please help.",

I said no, and he asked if it helped with my mental health or physical heath. I said no, and he said he wasn't mad because I thought this was going to be my last straw and he was going to send me to a mental hospital in Illinois but he said it wasn't and he was just disappointed I did it and more worried than anything and that I wouldn't be sent to Illinois.",

    "title": "Okay, non-self harmers... let's clear some stuff up:",
    "selftext": "1) I am not doing it for attention. Even if I were, that wouldn't make it any less valid. When they say someone is doing it for attention, they mean that they're silently asking for help. They want someone to ask if they're okay and encourage them to seek help, not oogle at their cuts and scars. \n\n2) It's not teenage hormones; It's depression. Even if it were hormones, why would that negate any reason to seek help? \n\n3) Please do not point them out unless you know me. If you do know me, please dont treat me like I'm crazy or act disgusted. That won't help anyone.\n\n4) Also, don't point them out loudly or in public. Even if I'm wearing a t-shirt with my wrists slashed to ribbons, I definitely do not want you to broadcast or shine a light on my issues in front of others. Keep your thoughts to yourselves.\n\n5) No, self harm is not exclusively done by teenagers. Adults self harm, and that is 1,000% valid. Don't demean me for never learning any healthy coping mechanisms when I never had the chance.\n\n6) I know it hurts to hear this, but even if you mean a lot to me, you don't have the power to change me in a week. One conversation won't help. This does NOT mean I love you any less, or that you are any less important to me. Self harm is just so hard to deal with on so many levels. It can take years to stop. Please be patient with me.\n\n7) Positive reinforcement goes a lot further than negative reinforcement. You could threaten to leave me or take stuff away, and I'd still find myself with new cuts that very night. However, when you praise me for a week, a month, a year clean? It makes me feel like I can do it.\n\n8) Please don't play mind games with me. Don't guilt trip me. Don't tell me, \"How would you feel if I did that!?\" It will only make me feel worse and more likely to cut. I can't believe anyone would think that this would make me stop. (Please refer to point 6 if you still don't understand.)\n\n9) Self harmers are desperate. If you take away my blades, I'll use my nails. If you start to check my body, I'll cut beneath my bra and under my feet so you won't see. If you threaten me in any way, I will still cut. Don't think for one moment that this physical addiction is anything that can be stopped at the drop of a hat.\n\n10) \"Have you tried coloring? Happy music? Talking to someone? Maybe watching a funny show? Maybe marking your skin with a red pen?\" Okay, let's get one thing straight: self harm gives you tunnel vision. It often feels like my only option, and sometimes my depression is so severe that nothing in that moment makes me feel happy. Don't give me generic alternatives you know will only delay the inevitable. Being a self harmer takes strength on my part to quit, but giving half-assed suggestions is not going to help me. I find that talking with someone helps a lot more than \"happy music.\"\n\nThese are just some things that have weighed on me for the past few years. If anyone has any more points, feel free to add them to my list!\n\nEdit: Holy shit, thanks for all the positive feedback and platinum/gold/silver!!! To anyone wondering if you can share this... please do. Go crazy with it. Send it to your loved ones who don't quite get it yet. Send it to a fellow self harmer who needs help explaining what it's like to their judgemental parents/friends. Post it on other platforms so more people can be exposed to it. I spent three days trying so hard to articulate what's been swimming in my head for years, and I hope this effort helps you all to spread what really helps a self harmer and what is detrimental to them. Best of luck to you all 💕",

And yes, I have that authority. I know because I gave it to myself.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Don't be mean.\n2. Ask yourself \"Would this hurt my feelings or the feelings of someone close to me if I said it to them?\"\n3. If the answer to no. 2 is yes, then don't say it!\n4. Repeat as necessary.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nP. S. Sorry to all you Richards out there. You can keep going by Dick and it'll be fine. We still love you despite the unfortunate nickname.",

    "selftext": "Today I hung out with a friend I haven't seen in months (mostly because of quarantine) and while we were vibing on the grass, listening to music, she took my hand to sanitize it and noticed the scars. At first I was really nervous, I didn't want her to be freaked out or something so the first thing that came to mind was to laugh about it and shake it off. She didn't want to change the subject tho: she looked at me, then asked me why in a light and kinda playful tone. I laughed again, unable to answer because of my nervousness, and after a first \"you dumbass\" moment she got calm and gentle.\n\nShe started searching in her backpack for something, at first I was confused, but then she pulled out a box of bandaids she bought at tiger and put one on my cuts. I looked at it with sparkly eyes like if it was the most precious thing in the entire world, not noticing she had taken a pen in her hands to cover the lighter and older ones by drawing a smily face and a cute triangle on them.\n\nShe kinda hurted me, I didn't know how because I was distracted, maybe by pushing the pen too much, and when I said \"ouch\" she immediately apologized and KISSED IT- I WAS SO EMBARRASSED-\n\nI laughed again, relieved and touched by her actions, as she wrote on the now almost completely faded ones (I recently had a relapse but some signs from the first cuts are still there) \"if somebody hurts you, I wanna fight\" which are the lyrics of a song she likes. She told me she loved me, that she finds me beautiful multiple times and that I am important to her. She hugged me, cuddled me, and even wrote a note for me to remember that I'll always have a friend in her. I think I almost cried, no one ever did this for me except her, she made me feel happy during these dark days I'm going through, a thing I thought was impossible...\n\nTomorrow we'll hang out again, maybe order sushi for dinner and eat it on the elementary school's stairs like we used to do before quarantine (it may be strange but we like it and no one ever bothers us there, especially during summer).\n\nSorry if this was so long, I hope this can cheer you up and make you remember that one day you'll surely find a thing or a person that can make surviving one more day worth it!",

He always used the right pronouns and addressed me by my preferred name which is a  heck ton more masculine than my government name. He always corrected others and I always appreciated it.\n\nRecently with my medical conditions and our financial issues killing us I could tell that he was stressed. He always is, I'm not easy to deal with.\n\nI talked to him about it and suggested he stay with his family for a week. He loved it and i loved that he loved it, i loved that he seemed happy, he seemes relaxed. Of course the horny bastard going from sex 24/7 to not at all, came back horny. So we fucked and it was amazing, but in the back of my mind i couldn't stop thinking about this little thing...\n\nSo i ask him,\nMe \"What do you see me as?\"\nHim \"What do you mean?\" \nMe \"what do you see, a boy, girl, neither?\"\nHim \"you're a girl of course.\"\n\nMy fucking heart stopped.

    "selftext": "Please forgive me I’m super scared and on a phone. \n\nSo yesterday my wife discovered that our daughter (11) has been cutting her arms.  After a bit of panic on my wife’s end we decide to talk as soon as I got home from work. \n\nWhen I got home I took a bit to do some research on why people do this and how to help.  \n\nA little back ground info and some character traits for everyone.  This amazing little girl is so smart and beautiful, has countless potential.  Is is the apple of my eye and is my whole motivation for everything I do.  She’s a great kid.  Does her best at most things and try’s to make people happy all the time.  She has a huge heart and I love that about her.  But this poor little girl has gone through a lot in her short life. 6 yrs ago she lost her great grandma who she was super close with, then our family dog, then her grandpa, then uncle.  Now she’s dealing with this pandemic and isolation from friends, she doing from home online classes so not a lot of socializing with friends or whatnot. \n\nSo we had a family talk and we asked her why she would do that.  She said she doesn’t like herself very much.  And didn’t give us a whole lot to go on.  So I just told her that I loved her and I was here for her, and that her life and body are like a temple and she shouldn’t want to hurt herself.  I also explained that she wasn’t in any trouble and we just wanna help.  I suggested some outlets instead of cutting like drawing whats on her mind or writing a letter.  I also explained that we wouldn’t even read them that they would be private and we can burn them when she was done writing so no one would ever be able to read them.  And today I’m going to take her to get some bracelets one is gonna say daddy loves you or something similar so when she wants to cut herself she will see it a hopefully remember that I love her. The other one is going to be blank and I will put whatever she thinks will help her on it.  \n\nI know I’m not the best dad on the planet.  I run a tight ship and I know I’m overprotective. I set somewhat high expectations but have always let her know that it’s ok to fail.  As long as she’s tried and put in the effort I will never be disappointed.  Even told her that making mistakes is how we learn.  But I work a lot so I’m not around as much as I would like.\n\nNow I’m a wreck.  I can’t stop crying.  I wish I could just take away whatever she’s feeling and make her happy. \n\nI don’t know what the next steps should be.  Should I set her up with a family/child therapist?  Is that to much to fast?  I honestly don’t know what to do.  I lost my brother to suicide, so I’m terrified that’s where this will lead.  I wish I knew what got us to this point.\n\nAny advice or direction would be appreciated more than you know.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n\nEdit:  I just wanted to say thank you to everyone for all the love and support.  My head is still spinning and my emotions are not in check yet but I’m trying.  On behalf of myself and my family thank you from the bottom of our hearts.",

    "selftext": "I have noticed a lot of the members on this sub are actually covert enablers, which sickens me. So I already know I’m about to be swarmed by the predators but regardless, I’ve noticed a super disturbing trend on here where people have absolutely no idea how dangerous self harm is. First of all. Let’s start with the glamorizing nicknames. It can be very enabling to others by downplaying the seriousness of the situation by referring to a potentially life ending injury as “beans11!!1”You are lacerating your skin. They are cuts, not pets. Stop giving them the cutsie nicknames.  it makes it so difficult for people to take you seriously when you do. Because it shows your lack of awareness. Second of all do you guys actually understand how scarring works? Because the same people talking about “beans” then ask for advice on how to make they scars “go away faster” they’re scars. They don’t go away. Some of them don’t even faded. I have scars that are over 5 years old that are still red protruding, and VERY noticeable. These will be on my skin for the rest of my life. So will yours. And no, good hygiene may help lessen this but it does not prevent this. A lot of scars actually become more noticeable over the years if they came from burns or you required stitches. Y’all are taking your body’s for granted. Third of all, I had two freinds who were sent to icu due to sepsis one of them has suffered a heart attack from hers and now has a pacemaker. That basically means she has a electronic device keeping her alive and without it her heart would fail. I’m gonna let you guys go ahead and guess how they got the sepsis. Now as a “senior” member of this sub let me just say, we are not stupid, nor dull, nor born yesterday. It’s very easy to tell by how things are worded and post history that the vast majority of you are extremely young. As in, be aware there are people who started self harming on here before you were even born. When one of these people try’s to give you advice or tough love don’t shut them down. Unless they’re being weird or are straight up incorrect. Odds are they’re trying to stop you from hurting yourself. I would rather offend one of you then spare my words then have you end up dead from ignorance. My point is we KNOW many of you are far too young to be able to understand the effects of what you’re doing to yourself. This is why we call people under 18 minors. It means they are too young to be making certain LIFE CHANGING decisions for themselves, not cause they’re stupid but cause they’re kids. None of us are on this sub because we feel good. We all could be more supportive and informative to eachother, but when you try to turn your pain and your Injurys into a competition, that’s where arguments start. Nobody is better than anyone else on this sub. But some are more informed. We know which ones of you want to seek validation for your acts of self hatred and which ones of you are genuinely seeking help. If you have no intentions of quitting or you think it’s cool that’s fine but bring that shit to a circlejerk sub and not on here please. Now about the whole “it’s a safe space” argument. In what sense? Sugarcoating and normalizing self harm isn’t damage prevention it’s quite literally the opposite. Do you know what happens when a bunch of addicts try to live together? It becomes a very DANGEROUS place. For all of them. I’m just ranting at this point but I guess my main point is if I had a forum like this available to me at 15 years old I would have been dead a very very long time ago. And I don’t think it’s doing alot of y’all favors. Please stay safe n stay alive. And try to have a good day. People love you",

    "selftext": "I used to self harm a LOT as a younger teen (12-16) but decided I needed to get better after a near-death experience. It's been 2-3 years since I started recovering (19 now), and since then I slip up from time to time, but otherwise I am okay.\n\nI slipped up recently, admittedly in part due to relationship stuff, which is part of the few reasons I wanted to wait to tell my boyfriend: I love him a lot and I don't want him to worry about me. I also don't want him to feel like it's his fault because it's not, even if it was partially in reponse to relationship problems we're having. I'm the one who cut myself, and he has no bearing on that.\n\nI knew it was probably a bad idea when I did it, but I felt like being reckless.\n\nNudity is a big part of our relationship, not just in the sexual sense: we love to lay together naked (or just in our boxers) and cuddle whenever we can. Honestly the casual nudity we have together has helped me feel a lot better in terms of body positivity.\n\nI cut a few days ago now, and I'm coming down from it. I feel the day after slipping up is always the hardest, because it's the day you choose whether it's a one-off, or if you want to fully \"commit\" to cutting again. It's still a little rough now, but not enough that I'm really thinking about it consistently like I do the day after.\n\nHe wanted to see me nude, and I, forgetting I cut myself a few days ago, stripped without an issue. He was in a position that he couldn't see it at first, and I said \"Oh. Oh I forgot.\" And I froze. He didn't get what I was talking about, and asked \"Forgot what?\" \n\nI never used to feel embarrassed or ashamed about my cuts or cutting in general, but man, I felt so embarrassed and ashamed. I never used to struggle to say I hurt myself, and I used to get angry when others would struggle to verbalize that I was harming myself when approaching me about it. But I just couldn't say it. I stumbled verbally, and he was confused because he still couldn't see it.\n\nI finally settled on \"I forgot my legs are doing bad.\" Which is certainly a euphemism. He saw it, and he's good at keeping his composure, but I knew he was upset, and he told me that he wished I had told him. Which is fair.\n\nHe's a huge fucking nerd and quoted some lord of the rings shit to me: \"I know this is your battle, but know you have my crossbow.\"\n\nIt feels oddly anticlimactic, he didn't make it into this huge thing, but I'm still thinking about it. I'll probably text him here in a bit to talk more about it, but it's daunting :')",

    "selftext": "I'm currently in my first year at a PsyD (doctorate of clinical psychology) program. My focus is on self-harm and risk assessment. My goal is to work directly with clients dealing with self-harm related issues. I used to work in an inpatient psych hospital that had many patients who self-harmed. I've directly intervened many times to prevent self-harm. I used to teach about self-harm. I'm also four months clean from self-harm.\n\nAnd holy shit. I can't believe that so many people, including people who majored in psych and *worked directly with clients,* don't know a fucking thing about it.\n\nLike, I'm already known as the \"knows a lot about self-harm\" guy (no one knows that I've done it, though) so I have had people ask. And I'm super glad that I got to educate them, but oh my LORD they didn't know shit going in. It's crazy how seldom they teach comprehensive information about SH, even in the field. It's because of stigma. It's not taken seriously by so many professionals, so they just don't care to learn about it. So I'm finding myself educating people *constantly*. Way too much for a *first-year student.*\n\nI had to teach someone that not everyone who self-harms is suicidal.\n\nI had to teach someone that self-harm is still self-harm even if there is no blood.\n\nI had to teach a **PROFESSOR** that there are more functions of self-harm other than \"show they're suicidal\" and \"release pain.\"\n\nThe worst, the FUCKING worst, was when I was telling a story about a former patient I had (without specifics, obviously) and how impressive it was that she went a week clean, and someone in the class had the *audacity* to say that it wasn't impressive, and that \"maybe a year or two would be good.\" What the fuck. I'm sorry, were *you* there to console her for hours on end to prevent her from trying something? Were *you* the one who glady took a punch from her to prevent her from hitting a wall several times a day? And, above all else, he said this to someone who was two months clean, which I was super proud of. But who gives a shit? Maybe if I can stay clean for a year then I can be respected.\n\nUgh. I don't have a problem educating them. I'll talk about self-harm until I'm blue in the face. But the fact that I *have* to so fucking often is just draining. Like, what about the students who I'm *not* in a class with? There's going to be a cycle of not taking SH seriously and not taking the time to learn about it, but you can bet your ass I'm gonna fight to break it. For myself, and most importantly, for everyone else who is suffering.",

We were like no shit sherlock but that's not how addiction works. My family has a long history of addiction so they should know. We kept telling them that we don't want to do this but it's how we cope.

I posted a picture of the area with a TW for self harm and asked if they were infected.\n\nPeople were.... mean. Which I guess I should have expected. I didn't even want to admit that it was self harm but the cuts were in such a way that you could tell they had been done on purpose, and I didn't want to trigger anyone without a warning.\n\nEveryone said I had no infection, and most people either told me to \"stop seeking attention\" or asked me if I \"got the attention I wanted\". I deleted the post within 12 hours because I felt embarrassed and stupid, especially because some people were flat out calling me stupid. I told myself I must not have an infection and I'm just being dramatic. \n\nI woke up in the middle of the night sweating and my leg around the cuts was swollen, red, and burning. I didn't know what to do so I waited until morning and went to urgent care. I had MRSA, a kind of staph infection. I had to be put on antibiotics and use antibiotic cream with heavy bandages for 2 weeks. \n\nI don't know why I'm typing this, besides just venting. I knew something was wrong enough that it made me share my self harm with someone for the first time in 7 years, and everyone told me to basically fuck off and stop fishing for attention. I knew something was wrong and they made me feel like shit for trying to get advice. People post pictures of wounds in that subreddit all the time, asking if they have infections, but because my cuts were self inflicted no one took me seriously. \n\nFriends, remember to sanitize any tools you harm with and treat the wounds properly afterwards. Keep them clean and covered. Use antiseptic and ointments like neosporin to keep infections away. \n\nI hope everyone is having an okay day today 💜\n\nEdit 1: thanks for the silver, stranger. \n\nEdit 2: I'm not trying to say that r/medical is a bad subreddit or that all the members are mean or whatever. I was just trying to vent in a place where I knew a lot of people struggle from the same issues I do. Thanks for the support and sharing your own stories 💕\n\nEdit 3: thanks for the gold.

One time, on a wing, i went and cut myself in the bathroom before we had sex. I remember her saying something along the lines of, \"damn, your so much hotter with fresh scars.\" (something like that, it was a while ago and i was high during it) I remember it made me feel oddly good in a way to make her happy even if it made me feel weird in my gut. So, i slowly started cutting myself before we had sex because it made her happy.\n\nThis week, shit took a big turn; she asked me if i would cut myself during sex and not before. I said no and that i no longer wanted to be with her tonight. but, she wore me down again and made me have sex and she made me cut myself. Now every day this week we've had sex, shes made me cut myself during it. I don't know what to do. i don't even know if i love her anymore. someone please help.",

Let me be clear right now about how we as a mod team feel about this:\n\n**If this continues I will personally ban everyone involved. I am dead serious about it, and there will be no appeal for it. This is really not okay.**\n\nWe have all worked hard to make this community a safe and welcoming space for everyone to share their stories, both good and less-good. There will be some fundamental disagreements because of this. That's just part of life, and the appropriate response is to ignore it and move on.\n\n***You cannot rain on someone's parade, but at the same time you can have a rainy day.*** Let me explain what I mean by that; you are allowed to be happy, but you are also allowed to be sad. What you are *not* allowed to do is make a post calling out someone posting about a happy or sad time.\n\nFor example, I might make a post saying \"I hate when my classmates wear revealing clothing.\"  someone else might post at the same time \"Today was a great day! I wore a tank top and felt so free!\" \n\nYou are *not* allowed to post \"the guy that talked about being triggered is a moron\" or \"that earlier post about wearing short sleeves is the stupidest and most triggering thing I've ever read.\" \n\nBecause guess what? Everyone's opinion is valid! You can feel how you do and they can feel how they do and we can all leave it at that. Some things may be upsetting, but let's be real human beings and admit that self harm as a concept is tough just *because* it means so many different things to different people.\n\nTL;DR: \n\nRespect other sub members. \n\nIn the wise words of the renowned poet Macklemore:\n\n\"Running around the whole town\n\nNeighbors yelling at me like, you need to slow down\n\nGoing thirty-eight, Dan, chill the fuck out\n\nMow your damn lawn and sit the hell down.\"",

Please dont be that one person that says \"fuck you you cut for attention\" or what my cousin of the same age as me said once when they saw mine \"horizontal for attention vertical results, dipshit.\" Never, EVER say this to some one that uses SH as a coping mechanism or does it in general. Last time someone joked about my scars I ended up relapsing and that only lead to more jokes. Instead of making some hurtful remark, ask us if we're all right, talk to us, or if not that just leave us be. Sorry for the minor rant everyone. I felt I had to say this since it still happens way too often.\n\nEdit: I woke up this morning to all of your support and... just wow! Thank you! This sub is so supportive of everyone and I'm glad we can all get along.\n\nEdit 2: thank you for the silver! It's my first and will remember it!",

So I panicked and I tried to hide the tissues but he saw them on my floor and then he saw the blade and asked me what the fuck I was doing.\n\nI was convinced that he would make fun of me because he does that a lot but he didn't. He just asked if I needed help or if I wanted to be alone. It was so awkward because none of us said anything but he ended up helping me clean up and put a bandage on. \n\nIt's a bit weird between us now. This morning he came into my room and just stood by my desk and after 3 minutes of him just silently fidgeting with my stuff he told me that he read articles about it. He asked a few questions (some of which I didn't really answer but he didn't push) but still doesn't really understand I think. \n\nHe promised me he wouldn't tell anyone and that if I ever needed him he would be there and try his best to help. He wants me to stop but he knows it's an addiction. Instead he'd think about what we'd tell my parents if I want to start therapy and he said he'd drive me to appointments if my parents don't want to (he hates driving me anywhere lol).\n\nAnyways, I'm glad that he didn't judge me. He always pretends to be all tough and not care about me as much but it seems like I can count on him.",

    "title": "\"She just cuts for the attention\"",
    "selftext": "A friend of mine turned to me as she said this, gesturing towards a girl on our swim team who had tiny red marks on her thighs. “Who’d be desperate enough to cut on their thigh...if they swim everyday?” I nodded in agreement. As a self-harmer as well, I felt that my friend had to be right. I felt as if, with every step this girl took and with every concerned look or eye-roll she received, and with every time I heard her declare ‘oh this ? AHAHA it’s not that bad, it could be so much worse!!!’ she was belittling my own experiences by almost bragging about her fresh scars.\n\nShe was cutting for attention. At least I had a genuine reason.\n\nA couple months went by and nothing changed. The girl on my swim team continued slowly adding to her collection of half-inch long shallow cuts on her legs, and people continued to ridicule her for it behind her back. No one had really liked her before this incidence, so it did nothing positive for her social life. I couldn’t help but feel angry towards her and everyone else who ‘cut for attention.’ Those who talked openly and uninvited about their scars and seemed to feed off the shock value and the pseudo-concern it generated from others. I felt that she had no right to cut. It made the rest of us look bad.\n\nI ended up going home one day and telling my mom about the girl on my swim team and how I felt about her, ranting about the invalidity of her self-harm in comparison to mine. What she said in response was one of the wisest things anyone has ever said to me.\n\n“If she cuts herself, her reason for doing it is no less as valid as yours simply because you cannot relate to it.” I was honestly taken aback. I let her elaborate further and that day my mindset towards the girl on my swim team, and the phrase in the title of this post, flipped upside down. I began to question why it is an inherently bad thing if someone does, in fact, cut for attention. Cutting is not like dyeing your hair or showing off your new car. Cutting - and self-harm in general - is a coping mechanism for inner struggle. And, accompanying this, it’s human nature to crave love and attention and form social bonds with those around us. How could I assume she was receiving enough love from her family or from her friends at school ? How could I assume she felt as if she belonged in this world ? How could I assume she was psychologically okay and was simply faking the aesthetic of self-harm ? The fact that this girl would go to such lengths for attention and physically harm herself - regardless of the size or depth of her cuts - meant that maybe, just maybe, she actually needed that attention.\n\nI began talking to her gradually - getting breakfast with her after morning practices on Saturdays and texting her throughout the week. She opened up to me pretty fast. He relationship with her father was on the verge of collapsing and she had recently been shunned from her classmates for reasons she still could not understand. As the two of us became closer, she began to cut less.\n\nI felt ashamed of how I had approached her struggles in the past and how I had done nothing to question what those around me said about her. To anyone who has read this far, please understand that self-harming ‘for attention’ *is* a valid reason. As humans, many of us can’t cope healthily with loneliness. To joke and mock depression and/or anxiety when one is not diagnosed is not okay to me. But to brag about cutting, and literal self-inflicted harm, is something that needs to be taken as seriously as those who cut in private. We need to help each other out, guys. Please don’t leave a fellow self-harmer in the dark just because their approach is different to yours.\n\nAnd by the way, 3 years later, she and I are now very close friends :)",

I forgot about this until I got home and for some reason I decided to look at the back of my arms around my elbow again.

I then looked at my hips, ankle and wrist and there were at least one or two same marks in those areas. \n\nI feel sorry for my past self.

    "selftext": "Here are some things you don’t often hear talked about with self harm:\n\n•If you cut- as your cuts start to heal, they will itch like crazy. Seriously- horrible itching\n\n•Self harm can be really really difficult to hide\n\n•Think about your future before you self harm. Are you going to be okay with your SO and or children seeing your scars? Are you going to enjoy going to the beach or pool with your scars exposed? (This isn’t meant to make anyone feel guilty, it’s just to make sure people are aware that what they do now could impact them in the future.) \n\n•Self harm tools can be really easy to find, and if not the tools themselves, it can be pretty easy to find other clues. \n\n•You don’t have to self harm for a long time for it to be addictive. It can be addictive in a matter of a few days. \n\n•If you go too far and end up having to go to the emergency room, your SH will be exposed and you might end up on a 5150 hold, depending on your situation. In my experience, the ER is very unsympathetic and often mean to psychiatric patients. \n\n•If you are a minor- therapists are required to tell parents if you are a danger to yourself. Not to discourage anyone from talking to their therapist- it’s great- just do be aware. \n\nEdit:\n\n•Please please please if you self harm with any sort of tool, sanitize it! Hot water, Isopropyl Alcohol, Alcohol pads, anything! The last thing you want is an infection!  \n\n•••• \n\nThese are just some thoughts. They aren’t meant to discourage or encourage self harm. They are just meant to bring awareness to people considering self harm. \n\nI know that self harm can often feel unavoidable, so I’m not going to tell you that “there are other ways, don’t hurt yourself”. But I will say, please if you are self harming, be very careful. And if you’re thinking about self harm- please consider what I’ve written.\n\nI highly recommend self harm as an absolute last resort. Please try to cope in other ways first. Self harm can be a slippery slope and it’s not easy to fight once you start. \n\nThank you for reading. I hope this helps even just one person.\n\nEdit: thank you guys so much for the awards! You are such amazing human beings! Means everything to me!",

Just please be considerate of other people when you're online because you don't know who you're exposing to that stuff.

    "selftext": "Posting here because r/amitheasshole deleted my post for mentioning SH.\n\nI was smoking a ciggie outside of a subway station today when 3 teenage girls approached me. The first one asked if I could spare 50 cents. Since she was wearing designer clothes I told her no. The second immediately asked if I could buy them a pack of cigarettes. I said no because she looked 14. She responded that she is 17 (still too young to buy cigarettes and smoke) and I said no.\n\nThe 3rd one without skipping a beat asked \"what happened to your arm?\". Now my arm is just scars. I am 7 months self harm clean but I still have very many clearly visible scars on there. I looked her straight in the eye and said \"None of your fucking business\".\n\nShe did not like my response. She asked me why I was so hostile and showed me her own scars for some reason. I told them to back the fuck off and leave me alone. After a short exhange they left and asked different random people for money and cigarettes.\n\nI have mixed feelings about the interactions. On the one hand I feel like it's entirely out of line to ask a stranger about their obvious self harm. My mental issues are none of their business. But on the other hand she was probably genuenly oblivious to why I was so hostile immediately. I heard them arguing about the issue for a few seconds after they left. First girl said not to ask questions like that and 3rd girl said it was just a question, that she didn't mean anything by it and so on. So my question is:\n\nAm I the asshole here? Was I out of line for telling them to leave me alone in that way?",

    "title": "Self harming for attention? You're not horrible.",
    "selftext": "There's always been a lot of stigma around self harm as we all know, people often assuming it's just for attention & often it's a lot of self harmers who look down on people who self harm for attention.\n\n\nI know that there are some people who do self harm with malicious intent, they want attention for the wrong reasons but I don't think I'm wrong when I say more of us than we are proud to admit, have self harmed for attention at least once. That doesn't mean we started self harming for souly attention - whatever attention we wanted but I'll elaborate some more.\n\n\nSome people do only self harm for attention, others only self harm for attention a handful of times give or take. It's important to remember that a lot of people don't know how to express their emotions so if people can see the physical pain, that often can start the conversation the self harmer wants to have but doesn't know how to start. Yeah some people will say that's manipulative but can you really blame the person? We all know the pain you have to be in to put yourself in more pain & when someone's doing it for attention barely ever are they showing everyone - only those close to them. It's a cry for help. It's them trying to express they need more support, they aren't safe. I know I've done it for attention a couple times & I did feel bad but I was in such a bad state that I couldn't talk (I'm autistic & go into non verbal states, also caused from PTSD) & I was just spinning mentally. I needed to be heard but didn't know how so the only person I showed was someone I knew who would understand & help me, someone who I also wouldn't be upsetting.\n\n\nI think we really need to speak less & listen more when it comes to self harm because there's so many reasons why someone will self harm considering we're all living different lives, walking our own paths.\nBelittling someone for self harm will only increase stigma & it seriously does no one any good. You don't know the ins & outs of the situation.\n\n\nSo, if you self harm for attention or have in the past, I want you to know you're not evil or bad & you don't deserve to inflict any more pain on yourself. Punishing yourself is tempting I know but you also have to remember the place you were in. If you would give compassion to other people who are hurting, then give it to yourself too.",

Everyone knows octopuses have 8 tentacles, right? \n\nGo and grab yourself a pen and draw a little clip art octopus (it doesn’t have to be perfect) on your hand, wrist, arm or anywhere that you can see easily. Make sure he has a cute little smile :)\n\nThen either in the comments on this post, in the notes on your phone or on some paper, write down 8 things that make you happy. Small things, like kittens or KFC. Now, give your octopus a name. \n\nThis is now your happiness octopus.

What about self hitters and people who pull out their hairs or punch walls until their knuckles are sore? A lot of professionals agree that even things like reckless behavior, staying around toxic people on purpose, and interacting with trauma triggers can count as self harm! It just annoys me to no end that the majority of people think that cutting is all there is, or the only ‘serious’ form of self harm.

The resident doctor that told me six months after treating one of my wounds that he still thought about it and found self harm cases very hard to deal with.\n\n\nEven after cutting so deep surgeons where called to see if I needed a surgery, I still felt like it wasn't valid.

I cleaned up, steri-stripped that bitch up beautifully, made a heavy outer gauze bandage taped to my leg to catch any excess 'leakage'. It was perfectly routine and I went to sleep a couple hours later with no worries.  \nAt about 6:30, I woke up just barely from a really heavy deep sleep, and kinda fluttered between waking up and falling back asleep for a while. In my cloud of fog i noticed that the whole left side of my sweatpants was warm and wet. I seriously thought \"What the hell, did I piss myself?? That's never happened before\". I was so tired I almost fell back asleep, but I patted my hand around on my pants to check out the situation a little bit. I can just barely tell by the faint glow of night lights that my hand has come up stained dark. Shitshitshitshitshitshitshit. I start to wake up more and realize this is something to take care of right now.  \nI'll spare you the gory details, but I was sleeping in an actual standing pool of blood, my pants completely saturated. I stood up and took off the pants and bandages, and while inspecting the mess I notice a foot or two away from me there's tiny, almost mist sized droplets of blood collecting on the ground like it's being airbrushed. It took a little bit for me to connect that with the mess on my left leg, I had to stick my hand in the stream and trace it, arcing all the way back to my leg.  \nSo clearly, my blood does not want to clot today. Currently I am sitting in front of the mess keeping pressure on the wound, waiting until my mom upstairs leaves for work before I get started on really cleaning up my bed and clothes and floor. I feel sick, and I can't tell if it's from blood loss or the realization that I could've died in my sleep. I'm guessing it's the former, as I don't think it's sunk in yet. I think this is gonna put me off cutting for a long time thankfully. Stay safe out there.",

All she showed me was love at my literal most vulnerable spot. I don't feel so alone anymore.\n\n\nEDIT: Thank you everyone for all the encouraging words. You all really are the best in this community. Thank you.",

Given the best happens tomorrow and I'm able to come online, I'll give an update on what happens.\n\nEither way, my point still stands. **Don't bring blades to school.** I get it, it's easier to hide from parents and it's convenient if you have urges at school, but having the school find out that you've been carrying those around? It's so stressful and nerve-wracking, even at the thought of what might happen (especially if your dad is hammering down the fact that its illegal). So, please, for your benefit, don't take them to school.",

    "selftext": "This is my first ever Reddit post. I normally just read nosleep and paranormal with some awww if I get too spooked. I have been harming myself for a long time now though. It started when my older sister's antisocial ways turned my entire family life upside down, and since then I've never ever felt mentally sound.\n\nThe first time was the worst, until today. I've cut myself a few more times since then but nothing too alarming at all.\n\nI won't delve too deeply into why I did it. But I was in the worst emotional state I have ever been in. I felt...unimportant. Ignored. Set aside. Unworthy. I couldn't stand feeling that way another second, so I took an object I had never used before and went for it.\n\nPlease note that I wasn't suicidal. I just wanted the pain to stop. All the other times I harmed myself, I had used a rather blunt object. I was stupid enough to think the new tool I used would give the same result, or just a bit more. When the blood gushed out, I realized my mistake.\n\nFast forward a few hours, and I'm back in my room now with a stitched up and bandaged arm. The doctor was slightly suspicious at first because I also had scratch marks on my arms (my initial and unsuccessful  attempts to get over that worst feeling in my life). She checked my arms and didn't see anything else (I didn't really target my arms much). She made me move my fingers and said I was lucky no nerves were damaged. My insurance managed to cover everything except the medication, bandages and ointment stuff I'd need until it healed.\n\nI don't know why I'm sharing this. For the love of what almighty being is out there, the last thing I want is to influence anyone on the edge of doing it too. I guess my main reason is catharsis.\n\nI know I'll get bad karma for making my first ever post a very unpleasant one. I just hope a few people out there can understand. I'll be grateful for whatever you can say, share, advice, etc. If the admins think my post is too much, I will perfectly understand it not being shown at all.\n\nAlso English isn't my first language, and for any possible questions about my insurance coverage, I won't be able to help much since I live in a small and insignificant island somewhere in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nEdited for paragraphs.",

Literally sounds creepy to me, like the way that predators look for certain characteristics that make their victims easier to gain and keep.\n\nIt just rubs me the wrong way. Like on TikTok I literally saw this guy talking about how he wants a depressed girlfriend so he knows she won’t cheat. Like 1)being depressed will not keep somebody from cheating and 2) nah, instead youd have to worry about suicide attempts or self harm or other severe expressions of depression. If this guy were to actually get a depressed girlfriend he would not be able to handle her and her problems.\n\nKind of reminds me of when people want a special needs dog because they are so cute, but don’t want all the work that comes with owing a special needs dog and expect it to act like a “normal” dog lol. It’s just irritating. Sometimes they even want to date a self harmer so that they can essentially fix them. Like sorry dude but a few good dates is not going to magically cure all my mental ailments which lead to me self harming. Strong “don’t do it, for me” vibes.",

Self harm becomes your teddy bear, your \"safety\", something that makes you feel in control (even though you're far from in control).\n\nI feel like this myth stems from pop-culture aka \"emo teenage girls cut\" (keyword teenage), most of us, even though we know it's not true, will think about teenage girls when we talk about self harm.\n\nIf feel like this notion that we grow out of self harm is caused by stigma and by people who lacks knowledge about self harm.\n\nI'm 20 today for 5 years I cut myself a few times a week, since then I've tried my best to stay clean. Even 8 years later I have self harm urges everyday, even though I feel mentally okay.\n\nSelf harm behavior is something you have to unlearn, it's not something you grow out of. \n\nI don't know what more I want to say about this, please let me know what you think!",

Sorry if this is the wrong place, I'm still kind of in that fog and talking about this works to stop myself from doing it again.",

SEEK MEDICAL ATTENTION, a bone may be fractured. continue to check capillary refill. \n\nBURNS: do not BREAK BLISTERS\n- first degree: swollen skin, skin colour is pink-red; remove all jewelry!!! immerse in cool-cold water. if this isnt possible, take a dressing (you can use a facecloth) soak that in cold water and place on top of burn. DO NOT PUT ICE DIRECTLY ON IT!!! check capillary refill. \n- second degree: skin looks raw and molted, extreme pain, skin can look white-cherry red and might have ooze coming out of blisters; do the same treatment as first degree \n- third degree: your skin will be black and charred; seek medical attention \n\nCUTS: \n- shallow cuts: wipe away the blood. disinfect with rubbing alcohol, wash your hands. take a breather. you can cover it with a dressing &amp; medical tape or a bandage. \n- deep cuts: stay calm. you can have an incision (clean cut) or a laceration (not clean cut lol). if bleeding a lot, take a dressing/towel and apply pressure. this will stop the bleeding. while youre doing this, try to calm down. the biggest thing to check is your circulation/capillary refill. can you wiggle your toes/fingers? clean the wound and continue to apply pressure. you can put your arm/leg up higher to stop the bleeding. if bleeding is excessive/wont stop please seek medical attention. \n\ni tried my best to list everything i know, if i missed something/you have a question please pm me. im on EST time zone and im a gen z kid so im always on my phone (unless im sleeping) so i can always answer your questions or help you. also i tried to talk as if im talking to civilians and not my first aid team but this is just the basics!!!\n\nif this wasnt allowed on this sub please delete im very sorry but i thought that this may help many people. \n\nref: https://www.sja.ca/English/Courses-and-Training/Documents/First-aid-reference-guide_V4.1_Public.pdf (i have my own copy + military first aid copy)\ncan also provide my first aid certification if needed",

They're disgusting and you have no reason hurt yourself anyway, I give you everything you want!\" I kind of just sat there in silence.\n\nI just don't understand. She gets mad at me for showing my arm but also for me covering it, I mean, what does she want me to fucking do? This isn't even the first time she's called my scars ugly or disgusting. She comments on them anytime she sees them and it hurts. And according to her, \"men don't hurt themselves when they get upset\" so I feel even worse about it.",

    "selftext": "*TL;DR: some girl in the bathroom at college used a handshake to grab my arm and see my scars closer. Just leave people with SH scars alone.*\n\nSo I'm using the restroom at college and there's one other girl washing her hands next to me. I had to pull up my sleeves like always so they don't get wet. \n\nAll the scars on my arms are at least 6 months old, so they're healed nicely, but there's still a lot. \n\nWell anyways, I'm finishing washing my hands (it takes a while... OCD) and I can tell this girl is staring at me while she's drying her hands off. Once she's done she proceeds to come up to me, stare at my arms and introduce herself. I have never before seen this girl in my life. She extends her hand to shake mine, but my hands are still wet. \n\nI go to dry my hands and then extend my arm to shake her hand. As soon as she grabs my hand she twists my arm and grabs my sleeve to lift it further, literally moving her head closer to stare more intently. \n\nI didn't even know what to do at that point... I mean I HAD NO IDEA WHO THIS GIRL WAS. So I yanked my hand away and ran out of the bathroom on the verge of tears. She yelled \"if you ever need to talk...\" as I walked away. \n\nWhat the fuck, people. This kind of thing has happened to me so many times and I'm so sick of it. JUST LEAVE PEOPLE WITH SELF HARM SCARS ALONE. We are not a circus spectacle. We are not gonna just start spilling our life problems onto some stranger we met in the bathroom or the parking lot or some shit. Just stop. Fucking stop. \n\n\n*Edit: thank you all so much for the caring (and also hilarious) responses. I don't have the time to reply to each one, but know that I love you all and I appreciate every single comment you've made... it really helped me feel better about this situation.*",

I’ve screwed up in the past by being cross - I apologised about 20 minutes later and recently told her that I don’t ever want her to feel bad about hurting herself in order to cope. I just want to do what’s right really and any help would be so appreciated right now\n\nUPDATE - thank you everyone! I spoke with her last night about the list of distractions someone kindly linked and the box idea and she thought that was really cool - we’re going to do that this weekend. \n\nThen I woke up this morning to all of your amazing support!!! I am so grateful to you all - It’s made me quite tearful! She feels a lot ‘lighter’ today and was well enough to go back to school, having been kept home yesterday for a mental health day with snacks and Netflix. \n\nI have a meeting with the school next week and I shall advise them on appropriate strategies (they really fucked up last week and made her show her arms to 3 different staff members) you guys have really helped when I was frozen with indecision and fear.

Unfortunately I don’t think I’ll be going to HR as many of you suggested. Even though what she did was cunty asf, I couldn’t be bothered to do all that 😭. If she pulls a move like this again then that’s another story. I’ve also bandaged the scars that are slightly scabbing due to sanitary issues and health safety (probably should’ve done this from the start lmfao). Well yeah! That’s pretty much it! Love u all and I’ll keep you posted if Suzan strikes\n\n\n\nHi, I’m 16 and I’ve been working at subway for a couple months now. I got this job during the fall so I wore the long sleeve uniform. The weather is getting warming and the ac in the plaza I work is completely busted so I ended up giving in and wearing the tshirt uniform because the heat was killing me.\n\n After my second day of wearing the new uniform my manager pulls me aside after my lunch break and tells me something along the lines of, “at least try to make the effort to hide your cuts, your making us look unprofessional.” \n\nBROTHERRRR, ITS SUBWAY?!?!?!  fuck you mean unprofessional 😭. The shy girl that I am wore the long sleeve uniform the next day 😕.  \n\nAnd I know some of you will say “quit girl! That women is insensitive and rude!”. That’s probobly true, but it was unbelievably hard to find someone who would hire a 16 year old where I live, so I’d rather just thug it through. \n\nIn conclusion, fuck you Suzan. Your a cunt\n\n\n\n(Edit may 31st)\n\nI got fired. LOL. Sort of my fault but I could care less at this point. She mentioned my scars again a couple days ago and I responded with how I think she’s being insensitive. She said something about how teenagers are sensitive and blah blah analogs balshhdiahsbdjjs a. I forget half the things she said cause I was just enraged by the balls that this lady has. I clapped back n then I quit my shift. She emailed me telling me I’m fired and I need to bring my uniforms back asap. \n\nsooooooo lol that’s what happened. Not mad not sad, just shocked that Suzan till the very end was in fact a cunt",

Don't know why bc she won't tell me s***\" and makes me seem like I'm an attention whore.\n\nWhen my uncle came up, he took me for a drive to just go hang out and talk.

He did eventually ask.\n\nI explained my side and some details about why the argument even happened. He was cool about it and asked me why I cut and politely if he could see my scars. I showed him and he didn't make a big deal about it.\n\nHe was gentle. He asked me if I had any support or any friends that could help. He told me he'd give me contacts to some people he knew that I could talk to.\n\nI didn't hear it all, but I do know that he talked to my mother when we got home. He had already chewed her out for hitting me before but now that he knew it from both sides he had more of an opinion on it all.\n\nI didn't hear most of it, but the small sentence I heard from my mom was her trying to blame me for this happening all because I didn't want to talk about it.\n\nHis conversation with me in the car was about an hour ish. I almost cried because of how nice he was and how understanding he was too.\n\nHe made me make a promise.\n\n\"Will you make me a promise OP?\" I don't answer but I look at him \"please, try not to cut. I know it's hard but please try\" I nodded \n\nHe made me feel nice. He made me feel. Emotion is rare to me now, or at least positive emotion. It was a nice day\n\nBtw if you want me to post about the argument then let me know plz. I may not remember it all tho cuz my mind blocks things out like that\n\nEdit: holy crap!

I’ve never felt so brushed off by a medical professional in my life, and it has made me hesitant to ever go to the ER for a mental health crisis again.\n\nEdit: Thank you so much for all your kindness, it really really means a lot to me!! I’m definitely going to file a complaint like you guys suggested, I appreciate you all so much!",

She was sleeping sitting up and I saw multiple deep cuts in her arms including scars. I walked out and closed the door not even grabbing her dirty close. I went to the bathroom and started to sob. I couldn’t believe my eyes and I still can’t. When I was around her age I also cut myself. I’ve gotten much better since then and have gotten tattoos to cover them up. I was worried that I would have passed down my mental to her and I have. When I was younger I committed many times and have been in the mental hospital for it. I know how it feels to be confronted by your parents about this. I haven’t told anyone not even my husband. I’m scared to ask her because I don’t want to  scare or hurt her. What do I do?",

    "selftext": "ok i feel like if i articulate this wrong then people are going to come after me. so let me preface by saying all forms of self harm are valid and everyone deserves help. \n\nnow that that’s out of the way- i feel like some people exaggerate normal things to seem like “self harm.” like a lot of people smack themselves on the head sometimes when they make a mistake, or bite their finger out of frustration, or bite the inside of their lip when it’s uneven. that’s way different from >! hitting yourself and leaving red marks or bruises !<, or >! cutting yourself with a razor even if it’s shallow !< , or >! burning yourself with a lighter !< and stuff like that. \n\ni guess what i’m trying to say is it’s frustrating when people exaggerate normal and basically harmless outlets of frustration  to seem like actual self harm. it takes away from the seriousness of self injury and i imagine can even cause harm to normal people who now thing they have a sh problem because someone on tiktok told them they do. \n\ndon’t even get me started on “emotional self harm”. yes, it’s definitely bad if you trigger yourself on purpose, or go back to a toxic ex even though you know you shouldn’t, or self isolate because you’re depressed, etc. you should definitely seek help if you do that. but that’s not the same thing as intentionally harming your body. it shouldn’t be lumped together. \n\nplease let me know if i said something wrong or offensive. i’m just trying to voice my frustration but i know it could easily be taken the wrong way\n\nEDIT: god people really took this post and ran with it. i half expected that, but let me clarify. i am NOT saying that sh has to be severe to be considered sh. it matters more what someone’s intent is, not what “method” they use",

Gotta remember there’s only room for 4 in the car, which is really just code for ‘there’s no room for you cuz ur the least important one here’. I was in the room when you first mentioned going to the theme park and it was clear I wanted to go but unless I’m in the fucking room I don’t seem to fucking exist, so you guys just book your tickets so there’s no chance I could go. I’m glad that a girl you’ve known less than 2 months is your favourite fucking being in existence and the friend you’ve known for 2 years could be lying dead in her room and it’d probably take a week for you to realise. Then again I’m not complaining about the new housemate  when she’s the only one who thinks to ask about me??? I don’t know what I did to just stop fucking existing in your eyes and no one seems to wanna tell me. I just seem to be yesterday’s news. ‘Why didn’t u tell us I finished with that guy?’ Cuz none of u seem to care or react to anything I fucking say to begin with but the minute something interesting happens I get all moody.\n\nThis has honestly gotten so fucking depressing, I’ve gotten so used to being ignored or forgotten that when someone actually replies to me or asks me a question I get so fucking happy. They could ask me to switch the fucking light off and cheers me up, literally just the acknowledgement that I exist makes me happy now, that’s pretty much the bare minimum. I don’t think my self esteems ever been lower, we’re having a little party in Saturday and when someone asked if I would invite anyone I didn’t wanna admit that I didn’t have any other friends, I’ve also thought about putting myself out there and dating, if for nothing else than honestly just conversation with people at this point, but then I think about how even my friends don’t wanna talk to me and I just don’t bother. I feel so fucking awful and honestly I’m nearly at a month clean again and I haven’t been that in so long, but I have the horrible feeling that depending on how tomorrow night goes I might just end up dipping out and locking my room and desperately trying to find something to hurt myself with since I threw out all my razors. But right now at least, you know what? I’m not gonna fucking destroy myself over you being shitty fucking friends. I’m sure you’ll have a great day in that shithole of a town without me",

At first I was hella shaken up and was seriously considering committing suicide, but after a day of thinking about it I really do feel like I'm prepared to get clean and hopefully get therapy. \n\nWorst part about the situation is my mom kept on saying stuff like, \"Think of how what *you're* doing makes *me* feel\" or, \"The government might take you away if they find out.\" But other than that I'd definitely say this is a positive experience.\n\nI should hopefully be getting therapy, and maybe even get put on hormone blockers and stuff.

My wife and I told her we weren't angry but we want to help her and we're suggesting that she talk to a therapist of her choice.    We're also telling her that we're willing to listen to her and we're trying to be as non judgemental as possible.   She's pretty reluctant to talk about the cutting and reluctant to talk to a therapist.    \n\nAny advice?   Should we keep encouraging her to talk to a therapist?   Any thing else we should try?   Should we try to remove sharp objects from her room?    Should we ask about warning signs (wearing a sweatshirt on a hot day, etc)?\n\nThank you and best luck to all of you!",

You self harm for a reason, so just stopping without ever finding a new way to cope/release emotions is a sure fire way to fail, and even end up relapsing in a way worse than you started.\n\nstress/anger: \n•beat the shit out of your pillows, I’ve seen people put their mattresses against the wall for better angle/surface \n•go into a garage and scream. I dont mean yell, i mean scream. Blood curdling, hair raising, language that would make a sailor faint scream. \n•get a dammit doll, beat the shit out of it\n•opposite action. If you’re feeling pissed, go do something soft, like pick flowers \n•hold ice in your hand until it melts (no, you can’t add anything else. Just ice you little shit)\n•make “slashes” on your desired real-estate with a red marker or pen, then rub ice over it. I swear to god it feels/looks almost the same its really trippy \n•destroy stuff. Got paper? Tear it. Boxes? Stab em. \n•write all the stuff stressing you out/making you angry on a sheet of paper and light it on fire (over a basin of water) and watch it burn\n•write your stressors (yes even people’s names) on raw eggs and throw them at a garbage can \n•brief intense exercise. Run as fast as you can (bonus if you’re running away or through the problems), jumping jacks, push ups, sit ups, pull ups, whatever takes a lot of effort \n•forced deep breathes. 4 seconds inhale, hold 4, out for 4, hold for 4, repeat. Try it for like 5 ish minutes, it should reset everything, but do it too long (like an hour) and you risk getting too lightheaded \n\n\nDepression/numbness/reminder of life/grounding/dissociation: \n•grab ice till it melts\n•drink a very cold or kind of hot drink \n•sour candy (not sour patch kids, i mean wear heads) \n•spicy food, don’t stop until your eyes & nose are running. Dead people can’t do that! \n•showers!! Hot or cold both work wonders \n•yoga/stretching/deep breathing \n•5 things you can see, 4 you can feel, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, 1 once you can taste \n\nAnxiety attacks:\n•ice (it really is your best friend here) \n•hot drink\n•weighted blanket\n•intense brief exercise\n•hot/cold shower \n•your comfort show/video (kids shows, crime shows, jake paul, it doesnt matter how “dumb” or “childish” or “weird” it is) \n•yoga \n•timer!! An urge can only last 30-60 minutes (though it may return), your body can only panic for 20 minutes before it breaks and is forces to calm down \n•breathe into a paper bag!! Its super cliche but this one is huge for me. Its physical proof I’m breathing and am alive & kicking \n•forced deep breaths again\n\nSelf punishment/hatred:\n•dollar store trip! Get a little candy, a drink, some cute stuff like that \n•go in public in general! Its hard to focus on how much you hate yourself when you’re out around other people \n•play with your pet. If you don’t have a pet, go to a petstore/dogpark and say hi to all the pets :) \n•make a list of the things you are capable of, or traits of yours that are admirable. Even if the list is just “humble” or “determined”. Even if those things are bc of self hatred & the determination is to hurt yourself, its still determination and thats an admirable skill \n•cuddle a stuffed animal (better yet, cuddle many) \n•smelly good things \n•self care bath \n•face mask\n•hot tea or coffee or milk or what have you \n•do your nails \n•put on your favorite clothes, even if those clothes are sweats you hide in. Its important to feel safe and comfortable when you feel so icky. \n\n\nYeah this is all the stuff I could think of on the fly, feel free to copy/paste & add your own! Good luck 💞",

    "selftext": "Hello all,   \n   \nI hope that you’re doing okay. I want to take a minute to post a reminder about the rules of the sub, mainly some of our rules:\n\n* **no suicide notes/threats** \n* **no encouraging self-harm**  \n* **no sharing methods of /instructions for self harm.**\n\nOver the last couple months, we’ve noticed an increase in the amount of posts that are looking for advice/instructions on how to self-harm and/or suicide notes/posts asking for help with suicide plans. I want to address these trends very clearly: **We do not allow these types of posts on the subreddit and they will be removed.** These types of posts are better suited to /r/suicidewatch and users are always directed to this resource instead.  \n   \nIf you see a post/comment that breaks these (or any subreddit rules) please hit the report button so that the mods are sure to see it. When it comes to suicide notes/threats, we remove the post from the subreddit, reach out to the user via private message, and forward /r/suicidewatch as an alternative resource. As this is a large subreddit, user reports on posts like these help us moderators reach out to people in crisis that much more quickly. (I mention this as some people hesitate to report as they don’t want someone to get banned who is obviously struggling, but we don’t ban people for something like this unless they’re an obvious troll.)   \n   \nOur (current and prior mods) hope for this community has always been that it be a place where people can feel safe and supported, not a place to exchange tips, tricks, or threats concerning our mutual, but arguably unhealthy, coping mechanisms. I think it’s also worth mentioning, though many of you are likely aware already, the various subreddits that reddit has banned (selfharmpics included) for being ‘dangerous’ or ‘unsavory’ communities. We want this subreddit to remain safe from that kind of scrutiny- we do not want to become one of the communities that lose their space.   \n   \nI expect that at the moment the increase in these types of posts has a lot to do with people struggling in isolation during the Covid-19 pandemic. This makes complete sense to me and I’m sorry things are the way they are right now. It’s hard, I know, but I promise it won’t be forever. Some of you must be living in hell right now, and I can’t imagine the pain you must be feeling. We see you, we hear you, we understand, and we’re sorry. It’s okay to not be perfect right now. It’s okay to be struggling. Just try to keep in mind that nothing is permanent, even this fucking plague, and there will be better things on the other side. <3    \n   \nTake care out there and thanks for reading,  \n\n\nSJ",

I've tried to explain it to my therapist but I'm not sure he gets it. \n\nSelf harm allows me to imagine someone would care and be comforting if they knew, even if I'm not actually planning on anyone finding out. It makes me feel more worthy of hypothetical compassion. \n\nIt makes the biggest difference when I'm falling asleep at night. If I've hurt myself really badly I can imagine that people would care if they knew, that they would think that I don't deserve to hurt myself like this, that my pain would matter to them, that they'd want to comfort me. That thought feels almost like being comforted as I fall asleep. But if I don't self harm then I don't feel like there's a reason for anyone to care. It feels so much more lonely.

    "selftext": "Thank you all for your help and advice about this. Like most of you said I asked her to come to her room so I can have a chat with her. I proceeded to tell her what I saw when I went into her room when she was asleep. This didn’t seem to make her very sad or scared. Her facial expressions were mostly confusion and a blank stare. I did try not to cry but a few were shed. I told her she is not in trouble and how long she has been doing this for. Her answer to that was “I don’t know” which most likely means for a while. I asked her why she did that and she didn’t want to answer so I asked her if she wanted to go to therapy. She did seem to like that but still wasn’t sure. When we were talking I told her that I love her and has always since the day I knew I was pregnant with her. I told her she means very much to me and that I think with some help she can slowly stop cutting. I told her that I used to and that got her to start talking. She asked me “how did you stop? How old were you?”. This broke me because the tone of her voice made me know that she is trying to stop but can’t . I told her there are many different ways and it’s not easy. For me I threw them away and I got into a knew hobby so I could distract myself from it. This is what I told her. She asked me “can i hug you?” Looking like she was holding back tears and I also began to cry. She started to tell me she had been cutting since about early 12. Im so glad she spoke up and is willing to tell me. She wants to go to therapy but I know I will need to tell my husband because he is going to wonder where she is going. I’m not sure if I should even tell him because when finding out I used to sh he was not to fond of that. Not that anyone is but he was more disappointed in me. My daughter and I cried in each others arms for about an hour and I went out to get her Starbucks afterwards. I asked her if she would like to be treated differently or the same. When I was younger and my parents found out they would tell me they love me more often and that would make me even more unhappy. That is why I asked her and she wanted to be treated the same as usual. Thank you everyone for the advice again and all the kind comments❤️",

I’ve only ever used pencil sharpener for sh once in my life and i hate seeing these videos pop up because it feels like instructions. I think so many of these tik toks are made for attention or to get comments like “I’m sorry” “please don’t do it” and other useless sympathetic shit. Maybe it’s just for profit and fame. Not to mention most of the trigger warnings are just “TW” written in bold text without warning what the trigger could be. Personally for me only videos with fresh self harm scars need it but whatever. Also I’ve seen some about what I think is anorexia.  I’m not sure but it’s just a series of stock photos of gum water and rice crackers. I’m so sick of going on apps to relax a bit and maybe see something funny and being bombarded with stupid stuff like this that I feel is offensive or random videos of serious topics like climate change. Am I just “pressed” or does this kind of content get on other people’s nerves?",

This morning  my brother walks in,  and yells “Wake upp!” Me being a lazy piece of shit fell back to sleep, then he comes in and yanks the blankets off, I’m alarmed but I still feel fine, there’s some cuts in the side but not deep and he won’t see them, I’m good at diverting attention. But my dumbass forgot the wraps on my other leg,  he looks in that area and ask “what’s that?” Then he sees the wounds on closer inspection, then everything, all of the inscriptions, artwork, 100’a of cuts and every other thing of sh I did on my leg. He goes shit blank and says “why?”, then “you know I’m going to have to tell mom”. I’ve been caught doing fucked shit so many times I just went into that state of waiting for others to take control, I was called down and my parents had a talk with me, they assured me I was going to be ok and this is just chemical reactions and shit, they tended to the cuts (a lot better than I do haha). Then they dropped the what’s going on... I was already fucked. I had to be truthful...really only time I was forced to be honest, I said it in words “ I want to kill myself” the tears and “ohhhhh honey” will forever haunt me, I put all of this fear on them for my selfish actions. My mom later in the day got me a notepad to write in and she wrote a long and beautiful note describing me from a baby to myself now, she made sure to emphasize she loves me dearly, this ofc made me cry. I still feel so uncomfortable with this situation, they didn’t take me to the hospital (good or bad idk?) but they said they would talk with a phyc for an appointment. I feel so bad for this,  I honestly wish we could just go back to when I was fine and dandy (I was hiding everything) no one would know what I was really feeling, now I feel exposed, scared, and guilty.

I'm pretty sure you're only a year or two older than me and likewise, still in college, but you've been working there for just over a year now. I've only seen you a handful of times and I really hope you didn't get in trouble. You said you'd take it out of your paycheck and tell your supervisor you were hungry. The store was pretty empty for it being in the middle of the day so you found the time to talk to me for two minutes. With a plastic bag full of family-pack bandaids, Neosporin, wide-patch gauze, pads, potato chips, and gummy worms, you probably thought I was a lunatic after scanning the 8th bottle of Diet Pepsi. \n\nYou started off by asking me how I was doing—I said I was doing pretty good, first time out in a couple of weeks. I asked you how you were and you said the same; these days have been pretty slow and quiet but good nonetheless. As you were scanning the 4th or so bottle of Pepsi, you commented on how I was a woman of \"truly authentic and good taste.\" I held back a dumb smile and agreed, saying that regular Coke was good but Diet Pepsi reigned supreme in the counterproductive diet beverage category. You laughed. \n\nFor some reason, I had my purse slung over my right shoulder. When I slid my card into the machine, my blouse sleeve slid up higher than I wanted it to. Even though you were wearing a mask, I saw your whole face falter. It didn't really phase me; I'm past the point of being embarrassed or caring whenever someone sees them anymore. After the machine beeped, you reached under the counter, grabbed a fistful of chocolate bars from God knows where, and tossed them into the bag as if it were a regular routine. I almost reached over to try and swat your hands away, but the plastic shield that separated the two of us won that game. Half of your face was covered but I saw how your eyes lit up—you were grinning like a kid at the fair. I told you to put them back before the security cameras caught you but you assured me it was okay and how you knew the angles like the back of your hand. \n\nWhile you handed me the bag, your eyes gave away your smile and you said, \"Come back anytime if you ever need anything. I'll be here.\" I took it slowly, processing your words and suddenly feeling vulnerable and exposed like a deer in headlights. I won't lie, for whatever reason, it caught me off guard. I replied, \"Thank you, have a good day\" in a voice too quiet for you to hear, at least, so I thought. \n\n\"You too. Have a day, a beautiful and full day, and another many more after that.\" \n\nI thought I heard you wrong or you stumbled over your words. I won't forget what you said:\n\n>*Have a day,*   \n>  \n>*a beautiful and full day,*   \n>  \n>*and another many more after that.*\n\nThank you Rite Aid guy. I hope your day was as wonderful as mine was :)",

She said instead of self harming I should use a rubber band or write on my arm and every other replacement that isn't even remotely effective. I explained how much this has a grip over me and how doing that is akin to telling a heroin addict to substitute it with weed. All she did was nod her head and move on to the next topic.\n\nMy family and my friends are even worse. My parents just straight up don't understand and make no effort to try while my with my friends it goes in one ear and out the other. I explain to them how hard it is to deal with emotional flash backs day in, day out and that this is one of my only methods to relax without just decompressing for 30 minutes to 12 hours. But they act like I should just use a bit of self control and just deal with my emotions. I tell them to imagine the time they experienced the most difficult and powerful emotion they've ever experienced and ask them what it would be like if they experienced that every single day for 12 years. Nope. Nothing. They literally just don't get it.\n\nI'm frustrated because it feels like I'm alone in all this.

We have no mutual friends or anything like that, I met him because he briefly dated my  Cousin (she lives a few hours away from me).

Earlier that day we were discussing how the heck either of us were supposed to find out if the other died. In the morning I saw the message he sent, I called  him like 100 times, I texted  Him on all his socials and I never heard back.  two weeks went past so I was very worried and I ended up texting my cousin. She told me he killed himself. I missed the funeral. I missed everything. I don’t know if he’s buried or cremated. I know nothing. I recently  relapsed after being a month clean. I started doing drugs again to. I feel so confused because I miss him so fucking badly and I don’t know how I’m supposed to feel.  I only met him once, it was a week before he died.

I’ve got a call to the doctor and will be getting him counseling.  In the mean time I’m just trying to be there for him and try to understand the triggers that make him want to do it.  We come from a long line of mental heath problems in our family and I have struggled with depression from about his age on to adulthood. I was suicidal in high school, so I feel like I understand a bit. Can you give me suggestions on how to help him, what has helped you? Is there anything you wish your parents knew so they could help you?   Thanks in advance and I hope this post is ok. I really need help.\n\nEdit: I just want to thank you all so much. You all have helped me so much to understand this better and how to help him better. I will continue be open and understanding with him and definitely get help for him and maybe family therapy to help my husband understand. And what you guys have really helped me realize is this is a long battle and I cannot expect this to be fixed over night. Thank you so much. I’m also here for you guys if you need a moms advice or if you need some love and encouragement.",

    "title": "\"Two cuts\"",
    "selftext": "To me, there are two main types of cutting: the long cut and the fast cut. And what differentiates the two isn’t about the cut itself, but everything that had led up to that moment: the ‘why’ I guess. \n\nThe long cut is a sad cut. It’s the one I’ve waited for all day, imagined in slow motion on repeat, fantasized about in my daydreams as I say to myself ‘It will be okay, just a few more hours and then...’ The long cut is like a hot bath, a soft nap in my own bed: something to come home to, something stable and reliable - a break from a painfully overwhelming life during which I can barely rely on myself to remember how to breathe. The long cut is a reward of sorts, like a pat on the back for making it this far as I let myself sink into the arms of intense pain after a slow day of dull, unbearable suffering.\n\nThe fast cut is an angry cut. I’m sad, maybe ? Jealous ? Numb ? It doesn’t matter. In that moment, I am angry. Perhaps I am angry because I am numb - the blankness of my mind when I know I should be brimming with joy, sadness. It doesn’t matter. The blankness is suffocating. Immediate relief. The fast cut is an inhaler, an EpiPen. I can’t breathe - or maybe I can, but too fast, to short. I find a vacant stall in the school bathroom. I wait as the girls next to me finish talking about their cheating boyfriends and leave. Or I’m at a friend’s house and their mom just offered me dinner. Or maybe someone I love has died. \nIt doesn’t matter. The feelings are the same; the overwhelming need to breathe again. \nFeel again.\n\nI tried to focus this post on more on the emotional weight of self harm. I used to cut a few years ago and have recently relapsed but part of what I’m doing differently this time is trying to explore how I feel and why I cut. Please respond with your thoughts, I’d love to better understand other’s experiences. \n\n...\n\nEdit : Holy shit this got so much bigger than I ever expected!! I'd debated posting this yesterday for hours and hours but you guys are all wonderful I'm so happy I did :) Thank you so much for responding and sharing your own experiences and emotions, I’m so honored to be able to read them all <3 Please be safe everyone, you are all so worth it.",

It’s only cat scratches so not insanely triggering but it’s still really triggering for me. I moved to this school recently and I was clean for around a year until I saw her, got a bit too triggered and relapsed at home. Now I’m addicted again. I hate her so much. I’ve never directly talked to her but no matter what she does she always talks about it and flexes it as if it’s something to be proud of. Self harm has ruined my whole life but seeing someone who cuts so light that they can still wear short sleeves and doesn’t need to use bandaids since they don’t bleed cut in public makes me feel physically sick and jealous. I’ve thrown up around 4 times now because of her. I don’t know what to do anymore. If I continue going to school my addiction will get worse. I feel physically sick looking at her do this. I wish she never did this because I just feel so sick and stressed every time I see her now.",

Okay so I’ve bin able to avoid the problem for a while now but today some stuff happened. \n\nSome info : I have some pretty bad sh scars that I am vv self conscious about but I decided to wear a t shirt today. \n\nI had to have a presentation in front of class and I could very clearly see her point at my scars while saying something with the dude she switches blades with. I saw her walking to the sink and she had like a patch of fresh bleeding cuts on her arm. AND WHEN THE CLASS WAS OVER SHE CAME OVER TO ME AND TRIED to like talk about how much she had bled all over her clothes. Like ? Just because I have sh scars doesn’t mean u can talk to me about that kinda stuff?? Especially when ur romanticising it??? Like stfu. I’m genuinely disgusted. I know it’s a cry for help but still what the actual fuck.\n\nlil update : The boy she’s switching blades with got taken out of class today because of it and idk if I said BUT SHE HAS 2 THERAPIST. I’ve bin friends with her before and she’s kinda the type of person who will be mad at me for getting diagnosed with something and getting better but then go complain and be horrible to her therapist and the people who are trying to help her 😃",

They all look different from each other and are pretty randomly placed because I don't want people to know I did them myself. Two of them look like anything could have caused them but one doesn't and I try harder to hide it so I almost always wear at least a t-shirt. Yesterday I didn't because it was supposed to be cold outside and I wore a sleeveless top and a jean jacket.\n\nI've been dating this guy for a month now and we went on a walk and it was too hot to wear the jacket so I took it off. And he noticed it and asked me where it came from. And I didn't know what to say because I have not been able to think about anything that could make a scar like that in that place. So I just didn't really say anything and he kept pushing the issue and asked if I did it myself. And that was a quick and easy \"no\" and that was it.\n\nI have never had anyone see my scars and ask directly if I have hurt myself. And now I don't know if I'm ready for anyone to actually see my body. Because I have more scars and there's no way they're not obviously caused by me.\n\nAnd especially this guy if he already thinks I might've self-harmed any scar he sees from now on will confirm that. And I'm not ready to have him or actually anyone to know. Only my best friend knows and she thinks I don't do it anymore. I'm just scared and lost and don't know what to do",

    "selftext": "I work with kids. For the summer I'm nannying a 10 year old girl, and I just met her and her parents in person for the first time yesterday. An hour ago I received a long email from her parents about my scars and expressing concern about what I might expose their daughter to, being the impressionable age that she is.\n\nI completely understand. They have every right to be concerned. I started self harming when I was 12 years old, just two years older than she is now. It was the worst mistake I've ever made in my life.\n\nI feel completely deflated. My dream is to work with children. I'm about to graduate college with a degree in social work, because I want to work in child welfare. I want to help kids like me. But how the fuck am I supposed to do that when I'm a walking trigger? What am I supposed to do? It's summer. Most days are at least 80 degrees. I can't wear long pants and long shirts all summer long, it's impractical. I would have such crazy heat exhaustion. But at the same time, the parents have every right to ask me to do that!\n\nI feel like I deceived them. We interviewed over zoom and they couldn't see them then. But what am I supposed to do, tell them I have a bunch of scars when they offer me the job? In my email response, I apologized for being misleading. I genuinely feel bad. But I also don't know what else I could have done.\n\nThese scars are never going away. Most of them I've had for 8 or 9 years and they still haven't fully faded. I haven't self harmed regularly in years, and in the past two or three years I've only had a few very minor slip-ups. I'm never going to do it again. It makes me sick to think about ruining my body even more than I already have.\n\nI don't know what I'm expecting to get out of posting this. I just feel so fucking terrible and I needed to get it off my chest. I can't tell my friends because I know what they'll say. They'll tell me it's my fault. Because it is. It is 100% my fault and I can't blame anyone but myself but it hurts so damn bad to think about. \n\nI was twelve years old. I didn't know what I was doing. How can you ask a twelve year old to think about the future like that? Even when I was fifteen, sixteen - I didn't think I would live to be an adult. I didn't care about the consequences. I was a stupid kid. I fucking hate myself for it.\n\nHonestly, I wouldn't be surprised if they fired me. I doubt they'd have trouble finding a new nanny, even with short notice, because the job market sucks here. I was so lucky to be offered this job and I've ruined it before even starting. Fuck",

What is this?” and listen. looking into parental neglect, domestic abuse, suicidal tendencies is fine and all, but throwing me into fucking jail isn’t. they’d threatened me with it, and I think they thought it’d help - that this shitty system helps at all, like it won’t prevent people from seeking help for their problems, like it’d be better for my injuries to gape indefinitely, kill me in the process as the blood clots over. If they don’t want me to die, maybe they should let me seek the treatment I need!\n\nThe association that help harm inherently comes with a desire for suicide isn’t right at all, and I wish the MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS here would realize that. I had to baby these middle-aged men, tell them kindly that “No, I do not want to kill myself, and Yes, cutting will prevent me from committing suicide.” If I can’t have my self-destructive tendencies fulfilled, I’ll move onto worse things. Taking away my blades will not help. Would you rather I bang my head on the wall of a psychward and dent my skull? Would you rather I cannibalize myself? Would you rather I genuinely fucking kill myself because I can’t have the one effective coping mechanism for myself?\n\nI am aware this is not sustainable, I am aware I need therapy, I’m aware I need help. It’s just that having access to help will mean having my issues place in the front and center of my mind in the stead of trying to contain them to my subconscious and suppress the urge. getting help will mean getting worse - and it’ll get much, much worse before it gets any better. If I cannot access medical help during that arduous time, I will not and cannot get the help that I need. \n\nI haven’t gone to school in two years. I am thirteen years old and I haven’t been to school in /two years/, struggling through self harm, bulimia, autism, sexual assault, the sort. My father has connections with an owner of a clinic, and it’s only there with the absurd, comical prices that I’ve been able to slip past the legal system and get my injuries stitched and cared for. This isn’t sustainable, none of this is. I can’t help but feel like I’m trapped. I don’t know what to do, if I can even do anything. I fear that further years will pass and I’ll only stagnate further. \n\nSometimes I fear that my family will get tired of this, will get tired of me constantly being so miserable. Oh look, she’s bitching and moaning about her problems yet again, just another Tuesday! - It’s irrational, I know it..likely is, but the doctors at that clinic have gotten tired of seeing me already, I think they have.

It’s a sweet thing to do. Unfortunately, she mindlessly took my arm and pulled down my sleeve. She was shocked of course, and so was I. I wanted to stop her or yell at her, but I kind of froze. She just pulled it back up and highlighted my hand. \n\nShe questioned why they were there and why there were so many, but I just couldn’t get the courage to respond. She didn’t really dig on past that, just some brief questioning.\n\nI feel guilty for her finding out, but also just worried in general that she’s gonna tell staff or other students.\n\nSorry if this seems stupid.

Every other selfharm scar doesn’t bother me, but the ones on my leg are different.\n\nThen I got interrupted by another girl. She just happily chipped in, talking over me, causing me to stop talking. She dismissed everything I had said and started talking about her scars on her leg. She told us about her 'list'. One cut for every day she had been separated from her then boyfriend. But not only that, she had told him about it. She then told us she had attempted suicide because of him as well, with five antidepressants and some cough drops, which she had also told him beforehand. She even showed us her cuts. They were superficial, typical cat scratch type. Which is still self harm, no discussion there, but she did it for the purpose of manipulating the guy into getting back together with her. \n\nI think everyone sitting there with us had the same thoughts in that moment.

If you want to reply with other advice/ experiences please do <3\n\nI wish i never made the first cut. Because back then, i was contemplating doing it for a while and then when i did it i swore i never would do it again. And that worked for a couple months, until it didn’t. The thing about self harm is that, even just doing it once, it establishes that path in your brain of it being an option to cope with pain/anxiety/whatever driving reason. Your mind and body don’t forget. So while I thought I was in control when i started cutting, I was just continuing to teach my brain that this was how i was going to cope with my emotions that i didn’t want to feel. And that fully led into the point where I wasn’t in control. \n\nIt’s dangerous. Don’t be fooled into thinking that you will have control. It’s not worth it. it doesn’t help, it doesn’t solve anything, it only makes things worse. You are SO much better allowing yourself to feel these emotions that you’re avoiding or trying to distract from. They will come out eventually. \n\nI say all this knowing that it is so incredibly hard to process through things and to resist urges. Life is so incredibly difficult and it honestly sucks, but doing this will only make it worse. You are worth taking the time to treat yourself kindly and to cope in healthy ways. It’s so, so hard but worth it. I, and so many people, understand where you’re at. Please listen and I hope you really think about this, stay strong <3\n\n\nedit: typo",

I felt that someone cares about me. I didn't want to let you go. You gave me a forhead kiss. It hurts. It hurts to see how much someone can love.\n\nThen I had to let you go. But it wasn't your last hug. When I got stiched up, you asked me if I want to stay for a few days in the hospital, where you work, just to rest, and keep me safe. I said I'll be safe at home and I have to go to school. But you made me promise that I'll come back to just check in two days later. \n\nYou said I can come everytime I want. You will be there.

Right after I thought that I realized that I’ve gotten a bit better in just the past year. It made me cry again, but this time a messy happy cry. Last year I would’ve just cut without thinking. 2019/2020 I was at such a high risk for succeeding at killing myself. I got especially worse over quarantine. I’m so glad my attempts failed. I never thought I’d see the day when I was better. I never thought I’d live past thirteen. Thinking about this made me cry. I’m in a better place now. I’m far from being fully recovered, but it’s a step in the right direction. I’m at my longest clean streak from self harm in 2 1/2 years.

I told them that they can’t put in sutures after 8 hours (it’s been 24) so my sutures are fine. And she’s gonna call the doctor Monday just to make sure I don’t have any infections. I’m trying to convince them away from normal counseling, I told them I’d pay for an online counselor. And they said they wanted to get me meds, but I said no. I found what was missing in my life, and that’s what I’m building on. I literally don’t feel like that actually happened but I’m happy. I don’t feel good now tho, literally feel like puking.

It wasn’t a cry for help (I had aesthetic/symbolic reasons for wanting it in the photo) but at the same time I’ve not been doing so well and I guess subconsciously I have been wishing that someone would check in on me. But at the same time this makes me feel like an attention seeker...etc etc\n\nAnyways my classmate asked if I cut myself for the picture, and not wanting to admit it in front of the whole (zoom) class I lied and said it was an accident and I just took a photo. My professor responded with something to the effect of “I was going to ask that later privately, I support authenticity in photo making but I worry when there is self-harm involved so I’m glad it was accidental.” But then later I slipped up when he asked if I had meant for the cut to look like stigmata (like a nail had been put through the hand) and I said I had put it there and done it like that on purpose.\n\nI don’t know I’m just wondering if (maybe hoping?) my prof could tell that I was lying and I had cut myself on purpose. I’m legally an adult so it’s not like I’m afraid he’ll tell my parents or make me go to therapy or anything, but I guess that I sort of simultaneously fear and crave that sort of attention/sympathy? I have literally never told anyone irl that I self-harm so I really wonder if my prof had asked me in private whether I would have told him. I hate that part of me thinks that I would have because then I feel like an attention seeker, but idk I guess I just wish I had someone to confide in.\n\nI don’t really know where I’m going with this but I guess I was wondering if anyone else struggles with wanting to express your pain and confide in some authority figure, but then also not wanting to deal with the aftermath and the pity afterwards. I guess it just comes down to wishing that self-harm wasn’t such a taboo subject and that we could talk about it without fearing that it’ll make people look at us differently. At least my class/teacher said they liked the photos I guess lmao",

We are all also at different points in our life story. Some of us might have just self harmed for the first time, some of us might be at absolute breaking point, some of us might be years into recovery. \n\nThis subreddit is for every one of these people. When you take that into consideration, you quickly realise that it’s impossible for no one to get triggered, or for everyone to be happy. By joining this subreddit you are willingly exposing yourself to all kinds of content. Of course there are going to be triggering posts, or posts that you don’t agree with. But you’ve got to remember that there’s most likely a real person with real struggles behind that post. \n\nWriting posts complaining about how X, Y or Z is triggering isn’t going to do anything. It isn’t going to make the post go away, it’s not going to make you feel any better. All it’s going to do is make someone who’s already struggling feel shittier. So take a long hard think before you write that post complaining, and really consider whether your words are going to do more harm or damage. In a world that’s so scary and confusing, the least we can do is respect and help those who are struggling. \n\nTL;DR: Remember the human",

I feel like a lot of people on this sub don't take selfharm as serious as they should, which is fine, but some things that get said about selfharm in a joking manner just deeply saddens me. I saw a post about how someone cut an among us into themselves, which I'm not judging, but it's sad how people are making one big joke out of selfharm. People in the comments where saying stuff like \"I cut ____ into myself for shits and giggles\" not only does it enrage me, it also makes me so incredibly sad. I understand that some of you can't see that selfharm is a really serious problem, or maybe some of yours' selfharm hasn't escalated as much yet, but trust me, selfharm is serious and you guys need and definitely deserve help. Selfharm isn't for shits and giggles. When I point this out in the comments I get downvoted and it just makes me so sad. I wish I could go back to when my selfharm wasn't such a problem yet, but now I have permanent damage and I feel like I'm doomed forever. \n\nI've already said this but I will ask/say it again but, I feel like this sub wasn't this bad before? Please tell me if I'm overexaggerating or anything, but I've been extremely active on this sub and I do \"call people out\" when this happens, but I just keep expecting better from this sub and the mods. I feel like this is getting out of hand and the mods aren't moderating it as close as they should. I've seen multiple people sharing information on how to make a deeper and wider cut, and what brand of blades they use, how to burn yourself effectively and all those things. Luckily I report it, and ask people to remove their comment. Yes, some argue, but most see that this isn't an okay thing to do. I've even gotten badly harassed by a guy who even went as far as making sexual comments about me and making multiple accounts to harass me. Mods do nothing and delete dangerous information like methods of selfharm and suicide way too late and I understand that moderating a sub like this is extremely hard, but I feel like that we, as a community need to help them a bit. Call out when you see things that you feel are dangerous or glorifying selfharm.\n\nI'm sorry, I desperately needed to get that off of my chest.\n\nTL;DR:\nBehaviour of a big part of this sub is getting out of hand, people are making \"jokes\" that aren't appropriate and sometimes methods on how to cut deeper or tools used get shared. I'm at a loss.",

As someone who could *never* in a million years be that vulnerable, I’m seething with envy. Also, I’m an adult (my sister isn’t), so no one can do shit for me if I don’t want them to. I want so badly to support her, but the dominant, wildly immature part of me wants to scream and rip myself to shreds whenever she talks about her psych team or the progress she’s making or what she did in Group that day. It’s no one’s fault but my own, I know, I just resent that she’s not a coward.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the nice replies and the award. Just to clarify a few things... I was in therapy for a couple years (coercion by my mother, didn’t have to listen but much easier on me if I complied), quit around October-ish because I wasn’t articulating myself properly and wouldn’t let myself say anything that wasn’t superficial. It feels even worse that I’ve tried it and “failed”. Whenever any doctors/therapists have referred me to psychiatrists, they’ve either been impossible to reach or have hung up on me when I panicked on the phone (pandemic telehealth is a nightmare).

I go there when possible and that includes stitches during hours they're open. \n\nI went today. I told them the truth. I told them I'd already spoken to my therapist (over texts) and she had decided I didn't need hospitalized or anything. I truly had.\n\nThey cleaned my cuts. Gently. They said the stuff they use stings, but I couldn't feel it so that was interesting. \n\nThey then asked if I had any preferences on how they wrapped me up over the stitches. They put a little woven \"sleeve\" over my arm since I said I have to bike home so it needs to be sweat resistant and thus nonadhesive if possible. I'll put a pic below. No blood shown or anything. It already got gray from me having to mess with something on my bike tire unfortunately. \n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/tcZxfkq\n\n\nI then walked out and biked home.

My school is in another city than where I my parents live so it was easy for me to not get caught at first. My roommates and a counselor saw them but i refused to talk about it so they didn’t bothered me about them. I was very careful at first, I stopped doing it around the times where I had to go back home but this one time I was hopeless and didn’t know what to do, so i did it. The cuts were not deep but there were a lot of them. I panicked when i realized they wont heal until I go back home but there was nothing I could do at that point. I decided to hide them by wearing long sleeves and it worked at first. I was lucky because it was winter and was not a big issue. It was a long holiday so i was at home for about 1-2 weeks. One day I decided that it was too hot for me to wear a hoodie so i took it off. Then my parents called me from downstairs for dinner and I forgot to put it on. My dad noticed them and immediately started questioning. I tried to lie and make up a reason but because of their profession they were aware that clean cuts like that wouldn’t be caused by my excuse. He took some photos and I just ran away from the table. They apparently had a discussion after I ran away and they called me to their room a bit later. We talked a bit and they decided to send me to a psychiatrist and were searching for reasons why I did this. I HATED seeing all those tabs opened on Google about “My teenage daughter cuts herself”. They looked at me like I was someone else for a while and refused to hand me sharp objects like knives and scissors. After seeing a psychiatrist for a while I stopped doing it but I recently started again because of reasons. Anyway, thank you for reading. \n\nTL:DR = Forgot my plan to cover my scars and got caught by my parents\n\nEdited to fix TL:DR",

After dinner we drove to a small beach in the dark. it was snowing. He yold me all about how he understood what I was going through, and he told me a ton of stuff I didn't know before. He told me how my mom was continuously beaten by her dad and had a very bad drinking problem for pretty much her entire life. He said she has depression and she used to be a Councillor. He said that he understands my problem because he's been with my mom scince his early twenties and she has always had addiction and mental health problems. He told me that moms whole family has problems with mental health/addiction, and he told me that I am probably predisposed to addiction. I agree with this because ever scince I was a baby I would pick my dry lips, pick at my scabs, chew/rip my nails, and a bunch of other stuff. So far only my dad knows about my self harm and mental health problems, but he encouraged me to tell my mom, because she was a Councillor and suffered from addictionso she will fully understand my problems.

(please don't comment anything like \"you deserve to live\" or \"just wait it out\" I could argue with someone for hours and it will not change the way I feel). It was around 2 am and I was exhausted and crying and snapped and he called me. A majority of me just wanted to decline and go to sleep but I answered.\n\nHe was crying.\n\nHe never cries. He has a really hard time showing emotion. He said I didn't need to speak and then talked for an hour. He just kept talking. He was crying. When I say my heart broke hearing him, it absolutely shattered. I didn't know he cared enough to cry over me. He was scared of losing me. He apologized for everything that needed an apology and just started going on about why he didn't want me to go. I broke. \n\nHe went on about little things that happen on a daily basis that I didn't even know he noticed. Everything from the dumb memes I send him to the panic attacks and my absurd amount of stuffed animals taking up half my bed. He talked about what he wants to do with me, go on adventures and get a cat and bring our dogs to the beach. He finally choked out \"Would you live for that?\"\n\n\"I don't want to sound like a selfish prick making it about me, but please, live for me. Because I know you won't live for yourself.\"\n\nThat broke me. I've never, ever felt the way about someone that I do this man. I've never had someone care about me the way he does. I don't know what I did, but I'm so fucking lucky. I feel like he deserves so much better than the broken mess I am. After an hour of lots of tears and talking down, everything was... okay? I don't even know how to describe it. An hour phone call that ended at 3 am after lots of tears and running noses and choked \"I love you\"s and apologies, all because he cared abt me. I have a reason to live. \n\nSorry for the essay. I have no friends other than him and can't really talk about this with anyone else.\n\nTLDR: I lucked out with an amazing bf who actually puts in effort to keep me alive.\n\nEdit: holy crap I went away for a few hours and came back to so many positive comments! Thank you for the awards!\n\nI truly, truly hope that everyone has a chance to have someone as special as he is to me. Sometimes there’s bad, but remember that occasional fights are healthy in a relationship. You’re not going to agree on every single thing, and your moods may but always align. Don’t break up over small fights. I know it sucks to be at odds with the person you love but work through it. I already commented this but here’s one piece of advice that completely changed how we deal with our disagreements:\n\nIt’s not you vs your s/o. It’s both of you vs the problem. \n\nBest wishes to everyone reading this <3",

    "selftext": "Thought I’d share something nice for once. :)\n\nI’m a substitute teacher, and I met a little guy last year who has self harm tendencies. At one point he started banging his tiny head against a pole, and as he didn’t really acknowledge my presence I just placed my hand in front of the pole, so at least he was hitting my palm and not the hard metal. \n\nI’ve seen him a few times this year and he’s doing better, but, still, you can tell he carries a lot of depression. My philosophy with him is that I’ll always be easy on him, so maybe I can provide him a little relief for a moment. I sat next to him while his head was on his desk (the rest of the class were with another teacher) and I talked to him a little, always very positively. He didn’t speak or look at me but I think he nodded his head when I asked if he remembers me. \n\nWhen I left he gave me a hug, and a little later on that day he patted my arm. He’s come a long way from not acknowledging I’m there, and it warms my heart that I’ve gained his trust. Little guy deserves to be happy.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the sweet replies. :’)",

I’ve struggled to not cut myself down there before but it finally happened tonight- I couldn’t take it anymore. \n\nI feel ashamed having female genitalia, it’s a stab in the heart knowing I will never truly have a cisgender man‘s body. Now as I’m typing I’m tempted to go back and cut myself down there again. I briefly considered using scissors to cut a piece of my genitalia off but I don’t want to go to the hospital or have my mom know. I just want this stuff off my body. I’d rather have no genitalia than female genitalia.\n\nI feel disgusted with myself when I experience arousal or the temptation to pleasure myself if you will. Yet I will go ahead with pleasuring myself sometimes anyways, only to feel guilt and hatred towards myself. I feel like a freak and an utter loser. The thought of being intimate with another person scares the shit out of me. \n\nI did get top surgery a few months ago which has helped a lot and since then I have no urges to cut my chest as I once did when I still had breasts. But bottom surgery feels like it’s ages away from me, I’ve put off going to college until I feel more comfortable in my body because I want that to be a happier part in my life after being so depressed in highschool.
