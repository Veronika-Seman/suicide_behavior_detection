(Tw numbers) \nI developed anarexia at 15, it became very severe taking me from a bmi of 20 to Like this 14 in three months, then I forced myself to maintain it by not eating. At 16 I decided I want to recover, so I did, no medical help either. I threw my scale out and just ate more. Currently 17 now and I have relapsed went to a checkup and I got weighed I had gained 13+kg. <  And was at bmi 21, I am now bmi 18.  I eat normally but just occasionally g0 days without food, lose weight and gain it back. This is really effecting my education and grades. Because of recovery I under performed in my gcses. Ya know how when you are recovering your body throws all the side effects of your diet at you at once. I feel like I have been stuck at one place. Like I am supposed to be getting my drivers license and becoming an adult but this Ed has just consumed two critical years on my life. I need to do well with my A levels. But I can't study my thoughts are just about food and weight all my free time is spent trying to walk as much as possible like I go walk for 4 hours straight till my feet hurt, while everyone else is on the libary studying. Or I sleep all day while I could be out diong stuff. \n\nI am really confused too. I have just had my first meal in 4 days, but it wasn't any low cal stuff. 3 scramble eggs with melted cheese, fried plantain, pickled tomatoes and a chocolate bar😭, I don't even feel guilty I ate it like I was normal. Then I am gonna eat more. It's like some days I can't eat and cry all day about my body but other days I am okay. I have also started purging and sh which I never did the first time around. I kinda want medical help, I have noticed I am alot weaker, before any of this I was a kickboxer but I dropped out and now just a tiny workout makes my muscles ache for days, my memory is terrible too. I have forgotten so much of my childhood and I can't retain any information I learn. I am just really confused I dont know what to do. I do want to be underweight s I loved the way I looked around bmi 16. I want to be skinny. I can't get medical help as of now because my weight does not meet the Ed criteria. Which motivates me to lose more. If I were to get medical help I absolutely would not gain weight. Whenever I am sad I just stop eating i really like the way hunger makes me feel. The alertness it's kind of addictive. I am currently trying  to get to bmi  during first week of Feb. Why? Honestly I don't know. \n\nWhat do I do honestly ",

I had been “recovered” for a few years but I started gaining a lot of weight during this time. By the time we eloped, my ring barely fit on my finger anymore. I felt so guilty and self conscious about it. My sister was making weird comments about my hands too which made me feel even worse. My hands quickly became one of my biggest insecurities. They legit looked swollen idk \n\nMy wife is wonderful though and took my ring to be resized at a jewelers. She paid for it and everything and never gave me shit for it. And after having it resized it fit perfectly. \n\nWell fast forward to now and I’m relapsing. My wife is somewhat aware of what’s going on, she knows I’m losing weight and she’s concerned about it. But she told me not to lose so much weight we have to fix my ring again since we just got it resized. I think she was more so joking when she said this because I don’t think she expected me to lose enough weight for that to become a possibility. I don’t think she realizes the extent of my relapse. \n\nAnyways I’m at a point now that if I lose any more weight my ring will likely be too big. It’s already loose. And I feel so so guilty about it. On the one hand I’m thrilled that my hands look more normal again but on the other hand I don’t know what to do lol I will not be getting my ring sized down again.

I recently discovered that a YouTube user I had been watching was lying about her measurements, and I found this to be triggering. People on Reddit were speculating that her waist was about 3 inches bigger than she had been claiming. It reminded me of other instances. For example, when I looked into Marilyn Monroe's fashion, I discovered an article examining her clothes. According to the article, Marilyn's waist measurement was closer to around 28 inches than the 22 she is always quoted as having. In some of her most popular pictures, she clearly does not have a 22, 23, or 24-inch waist. Hell, my waist is around 25.5-6 inches, and it looks smaller than Marilyn's at times (we are the same height). I don't know why people do this. It makes me feel like my measurements are inadequate whenever I encounter people lying. I have a similar reaction when I encounter people lying about their weight. What's wrong with having the weight/measurements that you naturally have???? I could pass for being around 125-130 lbs myself, but I won't lie and say I am. I can accept that I'm a solid 145lbs. Should I be lying? A part of me wants to start lying about my measurements too. Should I just say my waist is also 23 inches because it is in a corset? Why is this acceptable behavior that nobody challenges???? \n\n\n\nSorry I'm just so upset over being triggered. I hate liars. I hate that nobody cares about little lies like these.",

    "selftext": "I’ve been dealing with an eating disorder for about 8 years now. I’ve relapsed 3 times, but have been in recovery for 3 years now. When I first developed the eating disorder, I was in high school and had the flexibility to spend 35 hours a week at an ED facility (PHP program). After two years at the eating disorder facility, I finally got into recovery and only had one very brief relapse after “graduating” from the facility. However, I feel I am slipping. In my recovery, I gained a lot of weight due to health conditions, which unfortunately caused other issues. And, of course, my doctors have told me the only solution for some of these issues was losing weight. I’m currently 24, and I’ve been very stressed with my masters program In counseling and working as a mental health tech at a psych unit. Working in a hospital is stressful, not only because it can be dangerous at times, occasionally triggering seeing people suffer so bad, but also because… holy crap nurses are soooo bad with the diet talk. \n\nAnyways, Ive been trying to safely lose the recommended amount of weight that the doctors suggested. Went into this without any desires to lose as much as possible, to look a certain way, and the motivation to stick with my ED recovery. In fact, I even decided to start seeing my old therapist weekly at the eating disorder facility I used to go to.\n\nWhile I still felt unsure by the weight loss suggestion, I assumed I could do it if it meant not being in pain from the issue that they said is caused by weight. However, I find myself now being triggered very badly by the restriction and seeing the number on the scale decrease. I don’t want to go back to feeling like I’m dying, but that feeling of being “addicted” to the bad eating behaviors and the physical feelings that come with it is creeping back in. I feel like I’m losing my mind. Like I’m in a constant argument between the part of me that wants to stay recovered and the eating disorder that’s wanting to give me some sense of control again. I’m nervous about telling my therapist, out of fear she will recommend IOP. With school and work, I have no time for that. But, this eating disorder facility I go to is very strict, and if you deny a higher level of care recommendation, they drop you from services entirely. \n\nI don’t know what exactly made these feelings come on so strong. My guess is the high stress of grad school and the nature of my job mixed with doctors telling me my problems won’t go away if I don’t lose some weight, but I also feel like there’s some kind of other reason I’m feeling dragged down that I can’t quite pin point. \n\nIf anyone has any advice I’d love to hear it. Despite the field I’m going into, I can’t seem to think of advice for myself. I also feel like a total hypocrite. Because not only am I trying to go into counseling, but I was a former social justice educator and actively create workshops on diet culture and eating disorders and fight against essentially everything I’m doing to myself. One of those “body positive until it’s mine” type of things I guess. ",

Today is the second day of me taking pictures and recording everything I eat for my dietitian. My appetite has gone up a bit (guessing b/c of iron pills), so i ate more than i thought i would. Mainly snacks but it was junk. And now Im thinking about actually restricting again b/c i can see why i am so fat now that i see all the sugar and junk i eat, even in the small quantities. Then this got me thinking, do i just want to restrict to prove i have an ED even though im obese? Also is it weird that getting professional help just makes me want to restrict more? \n\nFeel free to ask any questions or/and be blunt.",

I was outside during lunchtime, which means packing a sandwich, and because bread is also not an easy topic, but Im glad if I can avoid waste, for some reason I used the pancakes instead of buns or bread to make a sandwich with plain prawns and lettuce. Now because I know I needed something filling, and both prawns and salad are both “safe foods” and very “healthy”, my brain was alright with me eating it.\n\nYes, it’s a VERY weird combo, but I basically ate pancakes guilt free! Maybe y’all can try out the idea, it might help to eat some foods you’re scared of. Good luck :)",

Each day flew by, as each opportunity seemed further away from my reach. All I cared about was fulfilling my ‘targets’ during the disorder. I felt numb. I forgot how joyous it could be to actually experience life again, but I definitely knew I was way too miserable to continue suffering in this state. \n\nFirst few weeks of recovery were so tough. The constant mind battles, the persistent pain, and not to mention the desperate pleading to compromise with my ed. But I pushed through. I started to taste food again, and allowed myself to enjoy it. A sense of nostalgia always showed up with each fear food I challenged. I used to be able to look forward to eating them, guilt-free. I asked myself “would I ever be able to return to that state again?”. \n\nAfter more time, it did feel much easier. This was during the holiday period. I was travelling overseas, and promised myself to eat whatever I wanted. I couldn’t miss out again. In the end, it worked in my favour. The dreadful bloating was all part of a natural process every body goes through. Turns out, I wasn’t horrible for allowing myself to enjoy and make memories.\n\nSoon, I was able to *feel* again. It felt amazing. The surge of emotions was so overwhelming and fascinating. It was as if I had discovered the meaning of life. An immense passion overtook me as I started on my hobbies yet again. My mind started working sharper. I was actually looking forward to events and social interaction. \n\nDay after day, It got easier and easier. Life stopped feeling like “disorder” and “recovery” anymore. I realised that as much as I cherish and appreciate this subreddit, I had to let it go. I truly felt grateful for everyone here, but I knew it would have been detrimental to my state of mind. In a sense, I had to let go of the idea of being “anorexic”. \n\nFinally, my period arrived today. Instead of taking it as a sign of failure, I am extremely proud. I worked to get where I am, reclaiming my health and future. I am also back to my starting weight. I realised I was never even big to begin with, and am genuinely sorry for my younger self for thinking that way. \n\nIf anyone is in recovery or considering, I strongly suggest to keep going. It may not be much, hearing from a random stranger, but I am really proud of you. Please take care, and never forget who you are. I sincerely wish you all well. Also, thank you so much to everyone here, you guys are the best 💗",

Due to this, I ended up developing a binge/purge eating disorder in high school. I overcame it with therapy and developing healthy habits. Along with weight issues, I also have stomach issues. I have never had a proper diagnosis (I have Kaiser and they suck) so I’ve been battling chronic bloating and constipation for over 5 years. I was introduced to laxatives roughly 6/7 years ago. I could not have a bowel movement without taking a stimulant. I didn’t think much of it at the beginning because my doctor told me to take it. However, weeks turned to months and months turned to years. The highest recommended dose of laxatives is 3 pills. I have to take 10 as of present day to have any sort of movement. I ended up getting weight loss surgery three years ago and the constipation got even worse. Now, I am completely dependent on laxatives. I have told multiple doctors that I’m concerned and fear I’ve developed a dependency on them. In turn? I’m told to take Miralax or Benefiber and it does absolutely nothing. I’ve hit my wits end with “professionals” I have tried to wean myself off on my own, and end up in excruciating gas pain and major bloating. I’m having a breakdown because it’s gotten so bad. I fought hard for years to overcome an ED  only to find myself back in the depths of one. Has anyone experienced this or overcame it? I would love some advice or tips. I feel so alone in this. ",

I have a calorie target that I set myself for every day, and my rigidity around mealtimes and safe foods has sort of diminished, but today I have a dilemma. I didnt get a hunger signal all day which I've been trying to use as an indicator of when I should eat (as any normal person would), and I think it's because I agreed to go out with some friends today and I plan on drinking alcohol. the problem is, alcohol cals are still TERRIFYING, so what i've effectively unintentionally done is banked my intake for drinking just in case. now, i'm aware this is not how a normal healthy person would do it. they would just eat their normal breakfast lunch and dinner and then have a pint or two, and the extra would be no big deal in the grand scheme of things. i know that. but the grand scheme of things is once again inconceivable to me as i'm now once again living in my own head. i've also slipped back into compensatory behaviours and very mild restriction since literally day 1. yesterday I had a cereal bar and it was lowkey still a massive win for me. my EH wore off about about a week before I left, so i cant even tell if it's my ed coming back into control or if im just showing the habits of a normal student with a slightly thrown off eating pattern like most of my peers. it's so hard. i hate this. im ashamed to say it but i thought i was doing well on my own, but it turns out i was really reliant on the encouragement of my family😭",

I hit my GW, now i'll just exercise and mantain right? \n\nThen i decided to shop at Zara and picked a super cute dress size S, i was so excited for it to arrive and.... the back zipper did not close. That's when i reslized, for the real this time: My bone structure will never change. I have a huge back/ribcage and no amount of weight loss will change that - i felt defeated and shortly after felt pathetic for feeling like this over a dress and just started angry crying on the floor. \n\nI still had a glimmer of hope however, \"Kibbe\"'as they call it. I'm 5'11 and fell squarely into the FN description. There's a \"type me\" sub and they ask you for all of the pictures to be taken with the back camera so i asked my mom to do it for me, she complied. \n\nI rarely see myself in the back camera, i always use mirrors and the selfie camera to check my makeup/hair when i'm out somewhere (which is very rare); Needless, to say, i was horrified. I am so, so incredibly ugly. The bug eyes, the deflated cheeks. I have scoliosis so it makes me look like i got hit on my side with a lead pipe repeatedly. My torso was SO wide. Having a thin waist meant nothing to me after seeing how wide the rest of my torso was.\n\nI ruined my body, my health, my social life, my hobbies, everything in my life for NOTHING. I thought i was going to look like those slavic models or the WWE divas i saw growing up and now i look like those warnings on the back of cigarette boxes.\n\nIf you're reading this, please consider recovery. Find resources, it's not worth it. I pray every single night for God to take me away in me sleep. To take me back in time way before i started creeping around pro ano spaces, this is my biggest regret in life and all of the damage is done. I feel defeated and cry every single day. \n\nSometimes i think of how superficial and vain i am when i think \"this would never had happened if i was born pretty\" but i truly think this is the seed that planted the huge tree of dysfunction where the fruits of my disorders stemmed from.\n\nSorry for the Great Wall of China of text, i just have no one to say this to.

I REGRET THAT SO MUCH.  I should’ve got off those damn games, went to talk with them. Go out with them, I hated my life pre ed I feel like, I honestly can’t remember because I’d probably have to go back a super long time to find a time where there was no ED behavior what so ever.\n\nNow I’m hanging with family all the time, friends as well. Yea there’s still a b/p sort of routine but comparing it to 2023, I fixed SO many aspects of it\n\nYes it is so difficult to live with the constant thought of calories , what will the binge be today, it is so tough. But at the end of the day I get to put on some sort of entertainment and sleep like a human should be able to sleep\n\nWhen I wake up I’m able to keep a breakfast / brunch down like every human should be. I’m able to stay hydrated , no longer anti social on all of those damn video games and staying in the room. I changed for the better in some aspects and worse in some ways (like developing an ED)\n\nSo I’m not looking to go back to pre ED, I’m looking to find a new version of myself. Where life and video games and food is all balanced and realizing that family and friends is so much more important than playing games, really changed me for the better. But of course this ED is hard to live with too, but mentally it was so much harder for me before it. Those sleepless nights and those panic attacks and that anxiety was so so bad.\n\nScrew video games and of those times I spent in my room when I could’ve been with family. All those times I should’ve went to family events instead of just staying back and playing video games.

A few days later me and my parents sat down to have a talk which ended in a brutal argument. My mom got mad, put words in my mouth, yelled at me, then stormed off with out me even getting a chance to explain what was going on. Before that i found text messages on her phone that were sent to my father that had incredibly private and personal discussions attached to which were meant to stay between me and her only which really upset me. I also had a feeling that she told my grandfather since that same night my guidance counselor called, i walked into the room while she was on the phone with my grandfather and she frantically took it off of speaker phone. \n\nMy instinct was true when the other day i was in the car with him and he \"randomly\" decided to have a conversation about how \"nobody's body is perfect\".

at around >!900-1100!<calories a day. i have been going to the gym once or twice a day, and  began strength training and running again. im still losing weight and am sure still in a deficit, and i feel ok with that. i am not going to as extreme  lengths as last semester, except i have started weighing everything i eat precisely, rather than measuring. but, twice in the past week i have \"binged\" (again don't know if it would be considered a binge) on popcorn and felt out of control with food. usually when this would happen, i would just chew and spit, but i find myself doing that less. even after these binges i am still below maintence, but i'm worrying i'm losing a grip on this, or slowly developing bed. i am lying to my family about eating a lot more and better, but i feel like im not? idk how to explain it, my behaviors i am engaging in now are far better than what i was, but i only see myself getting worse.\n\n i can't do this anymore, everyhitng is numbers. i was at a club meeting and just stared at the food the whole time calculating how many calories, while not eating any of it. i am so meticulous in how i eat, i have to have one paper towel in front of me, i need to shower before lunch and do my skincare before dinner, i can only eat my night snack in my bed, i can't do spontanuous lattes if im tired, or random meal plans with friends. it is controlling my life. i have a diagnosed anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder, and this is only making it worse. i am just so tired, i want to recover, but i don't want to gain weight. i just want to enjoy life again. i have a date tomorrow and we're going out to a place where the menui/website has no calories on it, and i know that's all im going to be focused on the entire date. i just want to feel normal, even though i feel like i did this to myself. i have such big aspirations for my future and after college, i want to go to law school or get a phd. i know that if i continue like this, it will catch up to me. \n\ni have not been formally diagnosed, because i have not told my therapist about this. i am trying to work up the courage to, but i don't know what would happen. i think i want to recover, but deep down i know that i don't. \n\nthis was so long, i'm sorry, i just feel like no one really understands how i feel and i needed to put it into words. thank you if you read this and i hope you have an amazing day and stay safe :) ",

I understand why she is upset with my and how my actions effect her but this has been stressing me out and making me feel so bad. I also had an appointment with my dietician this week and she said to me I’m going to be honest you are severely under eating and I see you ending up in inpatient in a couple of weeks. I also had an appointment with my therapist where she was also honest with me and said things like you are not in control anymore your disorder is, saying I have to push myself and take things more seriously, and how she knows my quality of life must not be good. All of this I think was the wake up call I needed to get out of this relapse but it also made me feel really bad at the same time. I want to make a change and I know I need to but I’m also so stuck. I arranged things with my therapist and dietician to help like having 2 therapy sessions and 2 dietician sessions in a week and eating while in session. Also making sure I go to a support group every week. I start this on Thursday. My mentality yesterday and today is like I have 2 days to restrict and engage in ed behaviors then I’ll start getting it together on Thursday. But yeah things just suck right now. I’m going to try my best to work towards recovery but I also have zero motivation right now despite everything that has happened. ",

The state of the world and country has me so anxious and so so depressed. My brain is louder then ever and I don't know how to stop listening. I've been losing a lot of weight, not necessarily intentionally, but my anxiety is making it impossible to eat but i'm not mad about it (I know that sounds dumb, I'm aware, but that's my brain for ya). A lot of my body image issues are back and I kinda hate myself. I don't think I fully relapsed, but I am definitely not where I was after recovery. When I was recovered, I refused to look at my weight, but now I take any chance I have to weigh myself. I feel so embarrassed that I haven't told anyone. I know it's not logical, but eating shouldn't be this hard, i'm 22.\n\nMy eating disorder also really affected my family. I was so mean, withdrawn, and basically hated myself and everyone else. I can't put them through that again. I don't know how to get help-- i'm going to start therapy but it's hard to find a therapist that will respond to me.

I'm sure there are options, but I don't care enough to properly look. I don't really know why I'm posting this, I just feel lost and wanted to vent.

I eat plenty of protein and fat and fiber, i literally went keto for over a week and it helped but it was unsustainable and ultimately i felt like shit just to have my stomach not CONSTANTLY be empty. if anyone has experience with this and has come out on the other side i would greatly appreciate and advice or reassurance.

    "selftext": "TW: anorexia, binge eating, self harm, starvation, BPD\n\nHi there! I (26f) have been dating my bf (26m) for about 6 months now. He was diagnosed a few  years ago with BPD (borderline) and was in remission for a year until the last two months or so. We had a really great and steady relationship prior to this and I am doing my best to be patient and understanding with him while he’s going through this and trying to get back in order. \n\nI was very open with him about being treated for anorexia and binge eating disorder on and off for 10 years at the beginning of our relationship. He seemed very understanding and supportive of me as I have to maintain an eating schedule in order to keep myself healthy. He would take extra precautions to make sure we had food during my time frames and kind of adopted it as well. It felt really nice to have a partner be so understanding towards me and not treat it as a nuisance to our plans. \n\nAbout 6 weeks ago he was triggered due to a fight with his family and began having a very scary episode that nearly landed him in a treatment facility. Earlier in the day, we were hanging out together and my notification for lunch time came up. I told him I was going to make us something to eat and he responded with “no I’m not eating today.” This ofc triggered my need for control but I said okay and let him know I would pack the leftovers for him in case he changes his mind. He never ate them. I could see the hunger agitation building with every hour. All of the signs were there that it was making him worse. I stayed supportive and offered the HALT method that I was taught to try to help ease things. This did not work.\n\nI think subconsciously (maybe consciously idk) that me pressing the food on him that day made him realize that him starving himself as a form of SH makes me pay extra attention as this has begun to snowball. \n\n1-3 times a week now my bf is refusing to eat for sometimes up to 72 hours. He gets incredibly emotional and angry in stages as the time goes on. We have had 3 or 4 upsetting conversations in the last few weeks (him telling me he thinks I don’t care about him and he can’t talk to me) and as I try to reassure him he makes it a point to throw it in there that he hasn’t and is not going to eat “over this.”\n\nI don’t know what to do. This whole situation is incredibly triggering for me as well as I used to fall victim to “accountability buddies” and with my codependent nature I feel myself having the urges to do it too. Does anyone have any advice???",

I know it's a silly reason to feel bad about, but I can't help thinking about taking extreme measures again so I can \"speed up\" the process.\nCan't discuss this with anyone that I trust cause I am afraid it will come off as jealous, bitter and stupid, so I just needed to vent here.  \nI am going to therapy to overcome this mindset, but I feel like I lost almost all the progress I made this last year and I'm afraid I will go back to the old habits.",

    "selftext": " I started my eating disorder at 13 when I would stop eating lunch. Slowly a span of a year I stopped eating breakfast to and then dinner only having a small snack in the day. Then after a while of not eating anything I started binging and purging. I was incredibly thin (for context I’m 5’1) but my family praised me for it. It wasn’t until an extended family member started noticing that I wasn’t eating by this time, I was already a few years in and after they started to help me realize that starving myself wasn’t okay. I started binge eating.  In one year I gained 70 pounds. Highest weight was 185Lb.  I would not longer starve myself but I started binging and purging a lot more (somewhere around this time I was diagnosed with PCOS) My parents started to catch on on what it was doing and sent me to a mental hospital. I was institutionalized for almost 2 months. The therapy sessions and the mental hospital only made it worse. I finally left but a few months after that happened my mom paid for me to get a liposuction. I of course, didnt maintain it well since I went back to binging and purging and then my mom put me on some weight loss pills. This helped a lot for me to lose weight, but it didn’t stop the binging and purging. There has been multiple times where I’ve tried to recover by starting stable diets, and being active. But I Never feel like I have the energy. And I constantly have crazy cravings, making me want to binge all the time. Even when I’m full, I still want to eat more, but the guilt causes me to purge.\n\na sidenote through all of this, my mom is an almond mom has always focused on beauty and looks her whole life. has always made comments on my body and what I should and shouldn’t eat.  got to the point that she locked our pantries and put a chain on our fridge to keep it locked, we weren’t allowed sugar. we weren’t allowed fats often. I have always been a chubbier kid and my mom would force me to work out even when I crying to stop. \n\nThe moral of the story is that I’ve been suffering from anorexia and mainly bulimia from ages 13-22 (present day) It’s been so long. I have no clue how to recover. I still live with my mom that constantly makes negative comments on my body. I’m traumatized from the mental institutions. I’ve been to. I’m still insecure about my body. And my PCOS has not made it any easier to recover. I’m constantly binging and purging. Yet, I’m still gaining weight. And the times that I tried to recover only causes more waking and more intense cravings. I have taken metformin, I’ve tried ozempic but nothing is working. I want to recover, but I also want to be healthy while still eating all the food that I love. I’m scared that if I keep on going down this path that all these years of disordered eating will catch up to me.  I don’t know what to do I’m so scared of gaining weight but at the same time I want to get better….. ",

And I’m worried if I do truly tell him, he’ll try and push for recovery, or even tell my parents. I’m just not in a place to change these habits, but I know they’re hurting him and putting him through the similar trauma of seeing someone he loves go through this again. Any advice? ",

    "selftext": "EDIT: Previous link to survey was not working, a new link has been posted :)\n\nHello! I am an occupational therapy graduate student and I am currently researching the occupational performance problems that individuals diagnosed with eating disorders face in the transition to a lower level of care (i.e. inpatient to day program to outpatient). My research aims to find important treatment areas that can help professionals working with people in eating disorder recovery. It also looks at how these treatments could change based on the level of care a person needs. Participation consists of an anonymous, 30-minute survey linked below.\n\n**If you are aged 18+ with a past or present diagnosis of: Anorexia Nervosa, Binge Eating Disorder, Bulimia Nervosa, Other Specified Eating Disorder or Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder and have been admitted to two of the following levels of care for eating disorder treatment: inpatient, day program or outpatient, you qualify to participate in the survey if you wish to.**\n\nThis **anonymous** survey will last approximately 30-minutes and will involve the completion of some short questionnaires about the impact of your eating disorder on daily life and occupational functioning, personal experiences during recovery, and navigating the transition between treatment levels. This research will help improve how people with eating disorders are supported in the future. It will also provide an opportunity for you to anonymously share your experience.\n\nIf you would like to participate in this survey, please click the link below:\n\n[https://qualtricsxmcfp4klhpy.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_diiM5SupGCCeGmW](https://qualtricsxmcfp4klhpy.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_diiM5SupGCCeGmW)\n\nThank you so much! :)",

    "selftext": "Triggering talk in here potentially about feelings of wanting to restrict more, be advised.\n\nI'm pretty new to all this in the scheme of things having entered into this sort of mental space as an adult.\n\nWhen I was just losing weight last year I was at under >!1200!< a day. I later moved that down to below >!1000!<, and it was when I went to below >!800!< that I really started to understand what I was doing. For better or worse I started looking at ED content online, and suddenly I see all these people managing intakes of >!500 kcal, 400, 300, 200!<... Cutesy diets interspersed with fasts where even the highest calorie amount listed was lower than my budget. I of course felt like a, I don't know. A wannabe. Suddenly my >!800!< felt like loads.\n\nI guess I've been trying to push myself down since then and have been striking around the >!600-700!< range recently but it's so hard. When I go lower the side effects get really much. I have a fairly intellectually demanding job and I can feel my performance slipping and I have to ration out what food I do eat earlier in the day to keep up, and then I am hungry later in the day... I don't actually want to lose all my energy and ability to function physically and mentally. I don't even work out like some people do and I don't know how I could even begin to do that, even on >!twice!< the calorie budget I see people who do >!20k!< steps a day eating. I don't fast at all either, unless sometimes OMADing at the same time a day counts.\n\nI feel so squeezed from both sides on this. I try to tell myself that I am a working adult with a fairly large body and shouldn't be comparing myself to numbers that often come from teenagers, but it still makes me feel like I just lack commitment and am faking, by making out like I have an ED when I am like. Putting my toes in the water at best.\n\nI know treating this as aspirational is bad and this attitude is in itself unhelpful and triggering for people. I know that I'm still eating a >!third!< of the daily recommended adult budget (even though I'm so sedentary my daily calorie use is probably lower than that, argh) and that this is probably still a disordered way to think and live. But I can't shake the feeling that I don't have a \"real\" ED, won't get down to the UW category or won't ever be able to properly have control over my body unless I go right down to the bottom of what's possible.\n\nI just don't want to be a zombie either, you know? I'm already pushing my brain as hard as I can manage I feel. I already have loved ones getting concerned and I'm like \"no but I'm not even as bad as I could be, don't you see?\"\n\nAnyone else feel like this? Any possibility I could get some reassurance?",

    "selftext": "I never had an eating disorder as a teenager, my relationship with food wasn't great and I was clearly an emotional eater, but I also genuinely just enjoyed food too much and overate regularly. I was always overweight as a child and then as a teenager, but I only got to be obese after certain trauma that made me double down on the emotional eating. I didn't realise how much weight I'd put on but it hit me all at once out of the blue. I remember wishing I was anorexic because I'd never had the willpower to lose enough weight to be a healthy weight. \n\nAnd then I really did become anorexic, lost half of my body weight, I was only ever just underweight, and I always felt like I couldn't really be anorexic since I was still heavier than most of the girls I knew were naturally. Granted, I am 5'8. But I was so sick, always in pain, always so tired I would sleep most days and nights, I couldn't walk long without feeling exhausted, I couldn't think straight, or at all really. Every night with my boyfriend would end with his frustration (out of love) and me crying as he begged me to eat anything, just enough to keep myself alive, and I couldn't. But I love him more than I hate myself, and I committed to recovery, I didn't want him to watch me die.\n\nAnd now, in only 3 months, I've gone from underweight to overweight. At some point I know extreme hunger must have turned into BED, but it feels the same, just a horrible desire to eat until I physically can't. But I can't do it anymore. I can't eat normally, I can't eat the \"right amount\". I can only ever eat nothing or everything. It hurts even more because my boyfriend tries his best to understand but I know that he doesn't. He says I could just try to eat a little less if I'm not comfortable with how much I eat now, and I can't. I can't unless I stop eating entirely. \n\nI can't keep eating like this, I will genuinely eat myself back up to obesity. And it'll happen quicker than I can imagine. I thought I'd never be overweight again in my lifetime, and yet 3 months of recovery and I'm already there. It isn't water weight, I've had days where I eat around >!6000!< calories, and I haven't had many, or any days where I've eaten less than >!2000!<, which is already more than my maintenance for a healthy weight. I hate that I have to do this but I am actively choosing to become anorexic again. There's no other way I can stop myself becoming obese. I'm so tired. I feel like everything I do is wrong. I eat too much, wrong. I eat too little, wrong. I just want out. I did everything right, I did what everyone said, I ate every day, I ate through the tears, and I ate on days I didn't feel hungry, and now my hunger cues are ruined. I gained all the weight back and more and the hunger didn't end. \n\nI don't know why I'm posting this, I just feel so alone. I feel like I undid all the work it took to be underweight. I've dreamt of being underweight since I was 5. I ruined it all. I'm back to square 1.",

    "selftext": "So I’m currently trying to recover by myself (idk how it’s going lol), and was wandering if anyone is/has had similar thoughts to me? \n\nFirst of all, I sometimes honestly don’t know how much is a ‘normal’ amazing to eat. Like I don’t know if I’m overeating or just eating how I’m meant to. Or sometimes I’ll have a thought not to eat and not know if it’s because my body doesn’t want to or it’s my ED talking. \n\nSecond, sometimes I feel bad for eating when I can do any physical exercise on that day. One way that I’ve been able to try and recover is instead of underrating, trying to eat ‘aesthetic’ food I see on Pinterest. Idk why it just makes it feel more ‘ok’ because I’m being ‘that girl’ if it makes sense? But ‘that girl’ also goes to the gym or does Pilates, and when I can’t do that (either because of school or plans) I don’t feel ‘entitled’ to eat like ‘that girl’ as well. \n\nAlso, sometimes I feel like EDs are kinda like a high school clique. Now that I’m recovering I feel ‘left out’, like I’m not ‘special’ anymore. I know this is messed up, but I think it’s just that my ED was my special secret, yk? It was pretty much all I thought about for a while, and now I feel like I’ve… idk… lost a friend? Ik, it sounds silly lol. \n\nFinally, I do actually enjoy eating. I’ve always enjoyed eating, calories aside, even when I was deep in my ED. It just feels wrong because if I like eating am I even disordered in the first place? At least that’s what my brain tells me haha. It’s not that I don’t feel guilty or it want to eat sometimes, but I’ve always been a foodie at heart, and when I’m purposely trying not to worry about calories, I actually do enjoy the food. But then I feel invalid for doing so. \n\nSorry if this doesn’t make any sense or I sound stupid, I was just wandering if anyone else feels like this? Is this normal? I’m honestly pretty confused.\n",

I terrifies me just thinking about how people might treat me if I lose weight and then gain weight back. (trust issues go brrr)\n\nI'm just so tired of being seen as a fat girl.

I thought that was really rude. I was 12 when that happened, but soon after my mom joined weight watchers and lost 100lbs. We were all so impressed and happy for her. \n\nBut then when she would take me and my brother to doctors appointments, we would always go to McDonald’s after. That was when she started making comments about every little thing I ate. “If I ate that, my points would be gone for the day (@ 10am)” “you wouldn’t catch me dead eating that” “I wish I could eat that but then you’d be embarrassed to be around me” shit like that. \n\nNext thing I know I’m obsessing over everything I eat and only eating certain foods around her so she would stop making comments and maybe be proud of me too. But then I’d binge on xx amount of hot dogs, multiple bowls of cereal and Doritos dipped in cream cheese and I just couldn’t stop. \n\nThat’s when I started purging. My family started asking questions and to avoid them completely I started purging into Walmart bags in my room, tie them up and throw it in my closet til everyone was asleep. \n\nNext thing I know I have a big black 30 gallon garbage bag filled with other bags of my throw up. God I could go on. It got bad. \n\nAnd the only thing my mom did to help me was take me to get drug tested every Monday for 6 months 🤦‍♀️ I wasn’t even doing drugs. \n\nThen one night I got tunnel vision and felt like I was having a heart attack in the ice bath I was in. Had to be rushed to the hospital. I had a mild cardiac arrest. \n\nThen a week later it happened again when I was at work and had to be rushed to the hospital again. My heart, liver and kidneys were failing. So they diagnosed me as bipolar and sent me home the next morning. \n\nMy mom still wasn’t helpful. I have a daughter now and I CAN NOT imagine leading an example that would lead her to suffer the way I did, the way my mom made me feel.\n\nWhat started the beginning for you?",

He cheated on me a few months ago and, weirdly, since then, our relationship has actually been way better as he’s  out so much work into it. But the trust is still broken (this becomes relevant). And then also my grandfather who I was really close to died a couple of months ago. On the day of his desth, I asked B to get me some water and his response was “How long are you going to keep milking this?”  Yesterday just got on top. He didn’t tell me he was goin to the gym despite us usually telling each other everything because he knew it would upset me and takes a little processing for me. But he then posted a picture of him there and I found out that way. If he’d just treated it with a bit more delicacy and care, jt would have been easier. Butir felt like lying by omission which is exactly how I found out he was talking to another woman. All the things have just broken me and I don’t feel I know how to exist as whole in this relationship and still trust him. \n\nOn paper, these secular events sound bad. But he’s unfair to paint him as someone he’s not. In between these happenings, he’s also been immensely kind and patient. I have awful anxiety and generally can be a little mentally unstable and reactionary and he’s patient and nurturing and kind even when I’m not those things sometimes. I love him with all of my soul but all of these things combined has began to make me feel like this relationship is an act of self-degradation. \n\nMoreover, for him the gym makes him happy ans feel better about himself. I hate how him doing something positive for himself can result in such awful feelings for me. I think it’s unhealthy that I don’t support thjs for him and actively hate something that makes him feel good. I don’t want to be someone who does that. It’s devastating to think of how toxic this has all become and how nasty it is I feel thjs way. \n\nThank you to everyone who took the time to comment. I appreciate your thoughts and time.  \n\n\n***\n\nTW - ED mention / substance abuse mention / self harm mention / suicide mention / relationship issues / exercise \n\n\nHello, \n\nI need help because this is almost ending my relationship and I just don’t know how to get out of this or how we can. Obviously trigger warnings of all kinds and throughout. \n\n\nI’ll go by A (f/27) and my partner is B (30/m).  We’ve been together a year. I’m going to try and tell this story as unbiased as possible to be fair. \n\nSome context, and trigger warning for all of this. I first developed bulimia when I was 8. I was raised in a neglectful home by a young mother with raging anorexia and a coke issue. She would not eat and give me her food so I was immensity overweight as a child. When my dad saw me on occasion, he would oink and me ans call me a piggy. \n\nFrom that age, I binge ate and purged. I self harmed. I hated myself from childhood. As I went into my teenage years, I got really into drugs and anorexia reared its head. Then so did bipolar. I spent all of my teenage years and early 20s in a cycle of self hatred, self harm, binging/purging, starving myself, and substances. There were some attempts at “recovery”, where the obsession became about list making and controlling my life in every other way. It was just like toxic positivity but make it ED. \n\nThis went on for years. Finally, a couple of years ago, I put in so much work and found a way to calm down my bipolar and, for the first time in my life, I had some actual control and peace in my life without being in thrall to my illnesses. My ED has been harder to deal with. People say once an addict always an addict, but I think once an anorexic/bullimic always an anorexic/bullimic. But, for the most partt, I was doing well. I was confident in myself and ate well and took care of myself. However, something to note, I am a “curvy” person. Antipsychotics took their toll on my body and I’ve come to terms with this and I was confident in my figure. I even could go to the gym without it feeling TOO problematic. \n\nAnyway, to now. Well, to a year ago. I met B. B was really into the gym and weight lifting. B would always say things to me like pointing out how “curvy” I am or “tall” or “broad”. I asked him to stop and said I hated him always pointing out my body and how big I was, even in the sense of being tall, but so many times he would tell me how broad and tall I am or would squeeze my arms ans say how they were soft and had no muscle. I became so aware of my body in ways I hadn’t in years. Of the space I took up. I’d never through or myself as broad before but suddenly I saw myself as big and different and unsightly in a way that was new to me. It was awful. He didn’t make me feel beautiful at all as new relationships are supposed to. I felt so aware or myself and self conscious. \n\nThis all sort of crescendoed where we were wielding our together one time and he told me how big my legs are. The months of him commenting on my body and then calling me outright big just unraveled me. It made all this new, tentative recovery come crashing down. \n\nThe gym has now become the biggest bone of contention in our relationship. When he goes, I spiral. I want to start doing all of these bad things to myself / my body again. I want to rip my skin off. I want to be rag and bones. I can’t stand myself. And it spins and spins around in my head until the only solution I have is to die to make it stop and be quiet. Every time he goes now, I am so triggered. The gym has become this toxic, monsterous place to me and all the typical ED competition comes out in full force when he goes. I hate it. I hate how angry I get. I almost hate him in those moments.

I would never ever ask him not to go but I don’t know how to her over this.

I don’t want to end our relationship but I think that’s the only solution. He won’t stop going, and I wouldn’t ask him to do that. But I can’t just ger over this either. It’s beginning to eat me alive (pun not intended) and I can’t imagine just having to feel this agony and rage and competition every time he goes now. \n\nWhat do I do? Am I being completely irational or stupid? I just don’t know anymore. I know I can lash out and be so angry and irrational when these things emerge and I hate myself for it but I don’t know how to control these feelings. I just don’t know anything anymore. ",

Feel overly full. \n- give yourself compassion and try to draw conclusions on why you fell into that binge. \n- WATER. Seriously I used to only reslly drink diet soda but lately I have replaced it with water and i feel better, i crave that more, and when I am binging, I don’t go completely crazy. I still made uncomfortable decisions on what I ate but instead of eating days worth of food in one sitting, I’ll eat like half of what I usually do. You know that feeling when you reach fullness but it’s like ur not done u need more. That feeling is gone. Now when I reach fullness, I stop . I feel thirst. That’s what I mistakes it for. It’s not a need for more food it’s a need for correct hydration. Again diet soda I liked the carbonation and it felt refreshing but it just made me eat more in the end. ",

It’s weird and I’m sure other people relate but even though I’ve been through it all myself I just don’t know how to help him\n\nHonestly, I dont even know if I need to worry. Maybe I do idk. He isn’t diagnosed with anything nor does he have any serious issue with food. HOWEVER.. he lost a lot of weight at a young age by developing very unhealthy eating habits. He was still doing these things when I met him and when he told me about a certain dramatic weight loss I told him he should start eating breakfast because I was worried about his habits. He hasn’t had issues since but that still worries me to this day because you don’t just starve yourself as a kid and play it off as normal (however I do see the side of being a dumb kid who wasn’t really educated and just wanted to lose weight but I’m his girlfriend, I worry).\n\nNow, a few days ago he messaged me really upset over gaining smth like >!4 kg!< and won’t stop making ‘jokes’ that he’s gonna starve himself again. Originally he mentioned dieting again (making starving jokes) and I told him that’s fine but he has to do it in a healthy way. No skipping meals, smaller portions and healthy food. He agreed kinda reluctantly and we went on. Now nearly every day since he’s been making jokes and also once or twice saying to me seriously that he’s going to stop eating. This is now worrying me a lot more.\n\nI know there’s not much I can do if he chooses the worse option going forward, but I really don’t know what I CAN do in this situation. I have talked to him about why he feels this way and what I think is the smart thing to do, as well as reassuring him that he shouldn’t worry and he’s perfect as he is but it doesn’t feel like enough.

In January of 2024 through most of February I started feeling more restrictive and had these “anorexia like symptoms” such as counting calories, restricting how much I was eating, wanting to lose weight, feeling fat, struggling with body dysmorphia, wanting to feel the hungry and empty feeling, etc. I can’t remember how many calories I was consuming but it was still somewhat normal. Before they started I was consuming around >!2,000!< a day (give or take). I really don’t remember what I was consuming most days during that time but it was at least more than now.\n\nNow for the past little while I’ve started to feel those urges again. They’ve came and went throughout 2024 but it never usually lasted very long and it was mostly just the feeling of feeling bad about eating and not wanting to but I never started counting calories again or heavily restricting. For the past 4 days I have been though. I’ve been counting again and trying to eat less and less. First it was (trigger warning, calories being stated) >!880, then 485, then 672, then today was 478.!< I know there’s people eating less than me and who have it worse but it’s constantly on my mind. >!500!< calories feels like a line I don’t want to cross. I feel gross. I don’t want help but I also don’t this to go on for too long. But I also do? Idk I’m very confused. Back in January of 2024 I told my therapist at the time (I’m no longer in therapy and I’m on a wait list) about my eating habits and how I was worried it was becoming anorexia and he told me it wasn’t. So idk what this is. I don’t want to get better but I do. I’m confused.\n\nAlso: since that time in January and February I’ve lost >!53!< pounds due to my stomach shrinking I guess since not eating much.

This swelling intensifies as I increase my food intake, particularly with carbohydrates, and it’s causing me immense stress and discomfort. I find myself hating my appearance more than ever, and the embarrassment is so overwhelming that I’m tempted to revert to restrictive eating habits.\n\nFrom what I’ve learned, this facial swelling can be attributed to edema, which is the body’s way of adjusting to refeeding after a period of malnutrition.  ￼ ￼\n\nUnderstanding that these symptoms are a common part of the recovery process and typically subside over time offers some comfort. However, the emotional toll is still heavy, and I’m struggling to cope with these changes. I’m reaching out to this community for support and advice on how to manage these feelings and continue progressing in recovery without succumbing to the urge to restrict again.\n\nHas anyone else experienced similar issues during their recovery? How did you handle the emotional and physical aspects of facial swelling? Any tips or personal experiences would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read and respond.

And at a time that I have been luckily medicated and realize this disorder is not part of my identity. I love you guys and since joining a few months ago have felt so heard, understood, & related to. This has been such a good sub to find and read through and feel the connection here. I'm sure I'll be back, someday, even just to see what's going on & gander at the memes.

Sure I hated my body before, but I don't feel as strongly disgusted by myself now given that my weight is going down, and it was already going down before I started restricting so heavily... \n\nI also don't feel the intense anxiety about food either. I don't cry when I'm forced to eat. I just feel annoyed and disappointed. I'm not sure my current emotions are strong enough to really describe this behaviour as compulsive. It feels like something I'm choosing to do. But I'm choosing to do it because it's... Comforting? Feels like I'm not reversing past work? But I worry that above all I'm mainly just doing it to prove I can, to prove that nobody else can do it \"better\" than me, that I can restrict if I want to.\n\nBut I'm not sure if I have the mechanisms in my brain that would cause me to compulsively do this long term. It's not been long enough to say yet. I feel like a tourist and so I worry that I'm persisting so hard just to feel like I'm not. Is it even about weight at this point?? I mean it is, it definitely is, but I hate that it's also about proving a point somehow. That I am choosing this and keep choosing it. It feels like an insult to the people who have tried to recover and not been able to.\n\nWhy am I hurting my friends and partners by doing this when I don't \"have\" to? When I know I could let go.\n\nBut the fact that I could so easily let go and start eating more again is what really scares me, and makes me push not to. If that happened it'd make me feel like such a failure, such a non-committal tourist. It would make these last few months of pain and stress be all for nothing as I would watch my numbers climb back up past everything I've managed to lose. I'm not even underweight yet (although I was obese a year ago so I *have* lost a lot).\n\nOr maybe worse, maybe I would go back to losing weight at a healthier deficit and still be going down and then it'd be like \"oh all this was pointless, you hurt yourself and everyone for no reason, you are fine being healthy about it and didn't deserve to kick up a big scare, you're not even putting back on weight\".\n\nIdk maybe I'm over thinking this and if it quacks like a duck and swims like a duck, then it can be considered one, and this is a restrictive ED whatever the cause. I'm just weirded out by how abstract my motivations seem to be. I seem to be almost addicted to the process of losing weight. It feels exhilarating in a way I can't describe. The dizziness is like a light high and I feel like I'm on top of everything even though I can barely function for shit sometimes.\n\nGod I should really be seeing a therapist. Must be nice to have money for that.\n\n\nEdit: and I am not even able to restrict as much as other people so I feel even more like I'm faking this because I don't eat under [number] like some people I see online",

I see my stomach as I sit down in the tub and feel disgust. All of this combined makes me dread showering at all.

Im scared tho that the weight I will gain and have gained is gonna turn straight to fat, especially in my cheeks and my belly. But I want it to turn to the muscle that I lost and give me my boobs and ass back. Im planning on when I’m given control over my diet again to try maintain right at the border of healthy weight and underweight, like the lowest of healthy I can be if that makes sense, because then technically I’m a healthy weight so it’s okay, and my mum said she’s fine with me doing that and weighing myself to check I’m not more and stuff as long as I am in the healthy zone if it makes me feel more comfortable. However, I know that wg in recovery usually gos to the belly at first but then distributes out, but if when I am at the weight I want to maintain at and my weight has distributed, if I do not get my ass and boobs back I’m thinking of maybe gaining more just until I get them back? But I know it won’t happen straight away so I just have to wait and see if it does distribute. If anyone has any tips on how to get the weight to go there and to give me my muscle back I would rlly appreciate it 🤍",

Someone in my family was eating mayonnaise and my step sister and I were jokingly making fun of them (because we just don't like the taste of mayo) and my brother called us ridiculous and said the \"only problem with mayo is the calories\" like 😭😭😭. Also, he always has to make sure I know exactly how bad and how many calories are in my food. Like please let me eat my chips in peace with out you telling me im consuming so many calories- I KNOW!

I guess that one isn't really my issue and it's kind of their thing to work out, but I think it's weird.

We were eating them and my dad and his gf looked at each other and said, \"we should make them try the scale\" My step sis and I gave each other \"a look\" (iykyk) and I said, \"what...?\" They explained how it was a scale that basically measures your weight, bmi, recommended calorie intake, muscle mass, etc etc. My brother said he would try it so he could know how unhealthy everyone was or whatever. My step sis and I intensified our look and both said, \"uhm i think I'm good.\" BUT I HATE THAT ITS STUCK IN THE BACK OF MY MIND NOW. I WANT TO TRY IT BECAUSE F*** MY BRAIN. IT'S CURIOUS.

We’ve had multiple conversations about it per shift since I told her a few weeks ago. \n\nI wish I never said anything about me and just let her talk because she’s a fucking blabbermouth and I’m pretty visibly underweight and short as fuck. She kept asking me like “What’s your secret? Did you change your eating habits? I just can’t believe you lost so much in a short time.” like MULTIPLE TIMES a shift. I honestly don’t know how long it takes to lose weight healthily, so I didn’t lie about how long it took me. I told her I stopped drinking soda, try for 10k steps a day, took up pilates and strength training, and was working with kids (we now work together in a hospital) so I stayed really active. She did not take that for an answer lol. \n\nShe’s gotten to the point now where she’ll be like “are you sure? were you eating enough?” when I finally said a couple days ago because I got so sick of the constant probing, \n“Do you want me to be honest? When I started I wasn’t doing the healthiest things.” \nShe asked me “What, like an eating disorder?”\nI said, “No I was really over exercising and thinking about it too hard.”\nWhich was a lie, I originally lost a shit ton of weight because I was broke & had no food with a thyroid condition and then when I saw how my body looked it was like a light bulb went off. \n\n\nShe finally let it go after that. I’ve worked this job for a bit over a month, everyone here loves to gossip so I’m sure she’s already shared this with our whole department lol. I just can’t stand people who feel like they’re entitled to your whole life story. I feel so broken that I had to share something so personal just to get this lady I barely know to shut up. I probably could’ve said something else, or something mean but that’s not who I am. I try to be really positive & I hate when I have to bring that negativity of my own disorder into the conversations I have at work, totally throws off my mojo. \n\nAnyways thanks for letting me rant, hope every one is having a good Wednesday so far! 🫶\n\n\n\n",

Yes). \n- I’ve been overweight and I’m so afraid of being back in that place. \n- I’m good at being skinny and having an ED. \n- Skinny = Control.

This started up a conversation with my step dad in which he quickly said “you look healthy”, of course not meaning to cause any damage, but completely setting me back mentally. I get the point of having to want to do it for yourself and knowing how bad you feel internally etc… but there’s just something about external validation that really helps. Honestly, I think he would’ve set it to be nice even if he didn’t believe it, which is kinda the issue, I would’ve preferred a “you are getting a little bit skinny” or something.

I have some very obviously mentally ill \"hacks\" for getting a higher weight on the scale than I actually am, but I was running late for that appointment and only managed to put on a pair of heavy boots before leaving the house, neglecting the rest of my plan, which I really regret. \n\nI guess I want to know if anyone else out there is in a similar situation, afraid your ED will result in losing the prescription for a medication you really need?

I currently am at the worst place I’ve ever been with my restriction. \n\nI very much have 1 toe in the recovery door, and 9 in the fuck recovery door. \n\nFor context:\nI had assessments with two treatment facilities who both said I need residential due to my symptoms and loss of >! 52lbs !< in a short period of time. But my husband says I need to recover without residential because we can’t afford him going on FMLA to care for our kids (I’m a SAHM). My doctor also said I don’t medically need res (even though she previously agreed with this?) The pcp, my husband, and the behavioral health team all think ED facilities push res because they want to make money. Which, as a business owner, I get this. But insurance won’t pay unless there’s reason to go. Andddd plot twist- my husband works with my doctor and the behavioral health team. So lines are muddy. \n\nAnyways. Eating more is physically painful. I don’t have a BM for 3/4 days, then when I have one I’m on the toilet multiple times a day. I get crampy and the gas pains are that of which I’ve never experienced.\n\nWhich tells me I’m not recovering safely. Or I need more monitoring. I’ve created a team for myself. My pcp is on board, I started with a therapist last week and I see a psychologist for the first time on Wednesday.\n\nI’m not asking for medical advice. But more or less trying to figure out where to go from here? I don’t know how to recover on my own, and how to be safe about it. I think in my soul I need res. Because if I’m alone then I don’t do the right things. There’s nothing holding me accountable. My husband took the batteries out of my scale, but when he’s at work I just put them back in. And I can’t stop this.\n\nI don’t want this. But I have no control. And i have two young kids that deserve to have a healthy mother. ",

I told them I wasn’t comfortable with that and they kept trying to make me send them that. They also kept asking when I turned 18. Then I told them my goal weight and they said to go lower and they’d help me if I sent them the bra and underwear Bodycheck. I once again refused. They also asked for pictures of my feet which I also refused. However I won’t play innocent in this, I stupidly sent them selfies of when I was heavier as well as Bodycheck photos with my tank top and PJ pants on. I also sent selfies of myself. At the end of our convo they told me to slap myself for overeating and spank myself and then asked if my skin was red and asked for photos. Then after that they asked if I could draw fatty on my stomach in lipstick. I’m not gonna play victim here, I continued to talk to them. My state of mind is no excuse. I’m just curious if anyone else has had this experience? If so how do I differentiate between fetish and help in the future?",

    "selftext": "F21 // So I struggle with eating issues, I don’t know if it’s a disorder but my psych has told me that it sounds like it and I think the hardest part has been accepting that it isn’t a normal pattern. I don’t really know what I’m expecting from this post really, but I don’t have anyone in my life that’s been through it and I don’t know if I’m ready to open up about it yet   - so here’s my story if you’re interested 😅 \n\nI was raised in a heavy-set family so growing up, I didn’t really think much about my body. My parents both underwent a bypass surgery due to health reasons and I think that’s when I first realized that we were larger people. I was young so it’s not like I really understood the whole situation, but I knew that my parents were once heavy and struggled with health concerns but now were slimmer and seemed to have less issues. I began to see how I was always the bigger one of my friends, not drastically but enough to notice. I was a quiet kid anyway so my group was small and I never really felt too weird about it. High school changed though. One day, I skipped a meal and this became a pattern. I didn’t want to be like my parents pre-surgery, so I kept skipping meals and finding ways to hide it. I didn’t really know about eating disorders but I figured that couldn’t be me because I was still very overweight. This pattern continued on and off throughout high school and honestly I never really slimmed down because when the pattern would stop, my eating habits were excessive and not very healthy. \n\nFast forward to the start of college, still very heavy but now it’s a hyper focus. I started going to the gym and I felt great, I felt like I had a handle on the restricting/binging thing and that I was “cured” if you will. I didn’t know the gym would only add gasoline to this fire. I started seeing the slimming down I had been trying for and it was in a healthy way! But, with this I started to skip meals again to “maximize” my gym progress. In my head, less calories consumed meant anything I was burning at the gym would just be stored body fat and I’d drop down quicker. I know this is not the safe way at all and that it’s not producing that result in the way I want it to. I can’t stop now. It’s gotten so much worse since I turned 18 because I got my own membership and no one could track how much I was going to the gym and I moved out so no one could track my eating habits. I’m still heavy though - I’m visibly overweight and that has not changed so I’ve been able to convince myself that this isn’t really a problem. Outwardly, you’d have no idea that I was struggling with this. I don’t look any different during my restriction stages, I do drop some weight for sure but I feel like it comes back when I exit that stage. \nIdk, it’s a vicious cycle that I really have no clue how to break. I get into the gym, I feel good, I start restricting, my body starts to feel really awful and I feel like I’m going to lose my control over the situation, I binge, feel awful, back into the gym - all over again… \nI tell myself to just start small and eat when I can but that hunger goes away after awhile then I feel like I just don’t need to if I’m not hungry. And of course “just eat” is never really that simple is it? The mental game that goes along with it is a difficult one to play. I feel sick instantly when I eat or honestly when I think about food. I feel so guilty after eating anything. \n\nI’m sorry, this was a long one and if you stuck around until the end - I appreciate you hearing me out. I’m not really expecting much as far as responses, but I just wanted to put it out there in hopes maybe someone understands. I’m currently going through a restriction phase and I’m a little anxious about it since my last one lasted awhile and my body has never quite been the same since. I know it’s bad but for some reason it still feels like something I have to do? Idk but thank you for listening 🫶🏻",

It was better when I wasn't at school because I ate when I was bored, but soon I started trying to cut down on sugar a bit because I knew I was eating too much of it and found that so easy to do because I really didn't want to eat, and eating made me feel like I was losing control.

It felt like a voice was telling me not to eat, that I was a failure for eating, and that I didn't deserve food. I felt so guilty eating. It got to a point I was only eating one meal a day (it was forced on me) and maybe a snack to ease the shakiness. I've always been bad with eating but it got to a point I felt like I fully was not allowed to eat and eating made me want to throw up.

I was in denial about the thoughts surrounding my weight for a while but I've come to terms with it.

On occasion, I get really self conscious about what thoughts and ideas people have about me, when they see me with my 3-4 plates of food on the table, but idk. Regardless, I found myself losing hecka weight because I was eating more alternatives than to\n'junk' food.\n\nLast month, I came back home for the holidays and throughout the time there, my mom made comments about my body by saying it looks 'nasty' and 'ugly' and that she doesn't like how I look and that I need to gain more weight.

I want to have to drop out and have this illness destroy my life. I want to die. I want to tell the uni I can't complete my exams.!<\n\n>!I'm generally in a shitty place- I came off my antidepressants a week ago. My blood pressure is extremely low and I alternate between brachycardia and tachycardia. I don't really care if I live or die and restricting is the only thing stopping me from self harming and planning my suicide.!<\n\n>!The GP told me that if my BMI went below 15 I'd be in serious danger and my ED took that as a personal challenge. I also told her my weight without clothes on at the beginning of the day, so now I'm scared that if they weigh me my weight will be higher and they'll think I'm lying.!<\n\n>!What's killing me is the waiting. I have to wait for the referral, wait for the appointment, wait for the treatment... !<\n\n>!I'm terrified of being hospitalised but the thing is I think I secretly want to go, both so I can feel 'valid' and because I don't think I can recover on my own.!<",

    "selftext": "I’m sorry for the long post, but I need to get all of this off my chest. I can’t talk to anyone about it because it’s far too embarrassing. I just really need advice. \n\nI’ve been chewing and spitting food every night. I would compare it to a binge in that it’s a large quantity of high calorie food, but I don’t swallow any of it. I feel embarrassed and disgusting. I’ve struggled with this every evening for years and I feel like I can’t cope without it. I spend over an hour doing it in the evenings as this is the time I most struggle with depression and feeling restless and it’s the only thing that comforts and distracts me and helps me sleep. I rely on it so much. I would also compare it to emotional eating for that reason. \n\n It’s wasted so much money, it’s ruined my teeth and it’s made my weight fluctuate so much. I fast every day because I know I’m ingesting calories from chewing and spitting. I used to be severely underweight and it’s made me gain weight slowly over time. I’m still underweight but I can’t cope with the fact that my weight gain has been from this behaviour that isn’t in my control and not from choosing to eat. I’m terrified of the calories I’m taking in but I still can’t stop. I don’t swallow any of the food and yet I have gained weight. It doesn’t make sense. This is the one major thing holding me back from being in recovery. Knowing I do this behaviour every evening I can’t allow myself to eat at all. I don’t work or do anything so I spend my days walking and exercising to try to offset the calories I’m taking in. I’m exhausted from the constant exercise and fasting. With my intake and activity levels I should be losing weight, but my weight has remained the same for 2 years. It’s not that I’m looking for advice on how to stop this and lose weight, it’s that the fact that this is affecting my weight is holding me back from eating at all. I can’t I justify eating anything when I know that I’m already taking in an unknown number of calories that’s affecting my ability to control my weight. I feel powerless to stop because it’s on my mind at every moment of the day - I look forward to that time in the evening where I can have a break from how awful I feel and have some comfort. \n\nI know that in theory I should eat during the day to stop feeling hungry and to stop craving food. I’ve tried this but it doesn’t help as the emotional dependence on the behaviour is too strong. I feel a compulsion to do it whether I’m hungry or not. Even in hospital when I was managing to eat small amounts the urge to chew and spit in the evenings was unbearable. I would hoard food from the vending machines and chew and spit in secret when I could. On evenings where I couldn’t do it. the feelings were so uncomfortable that I couldn’t sleep, I couldn’t sit still and I had strong urges to self-harm. Those feelings are worse than I can describe and that’s why I can’t go even one day without doing it. It’s too much. \n\nI guess I’m just looking for advice, or at least someone who can relate. Or just tell me I’m disgusting and move on lol. It feels like I’m the only one in the world who struggles with this to this extent. It’s so lonely and isolating and above all just embarrassing.",

She heard me out and told me she wanted me in counseling but said she had to tell my father. The funny thing is, after all i said she chooses to pick one thing from the conversation to put emphasis on when several other things were discussed.\n\nNumber 3: Sat down with my mother and father and tried to talk which only ended in a fight.

We’ll be talking on the phone, but she’ll have very limited phone time for the first while, so I thought letters could help her feel close and updated on my life. I’d add pictures of things I’ve been up to/maybe little motivational things as well.\n\n2) Send her a weighted blanket/stuffy. She’s allowed to have them, but they have to be new or dry cleaned, so she’s not bringing any with her initially. \n\nAlso, if anyone has any general advice for her/me in regards to residential, that would be greatly appreciated.

Apparently the lunch was really good that day but I wasnt eating it i quickly ate a small granola bar or breakfast cracker because I hate eating around others. The girls were trying to find like people in the class who didnt want their lunch because they wanted extra. I didnt want to waste the food so i reached back and held my plate in front of them. Two of them hurried and grabbed the plate and yelled thank you (i dont blame them it did smell good) but 2 of the other girls looked concerned. One asked \"wait, your seriously not hungry?\" and I shook my head no. She continued \"I've never see you eat the lunch before\" and then the other girl said \"Yeah I only see you eating the oranges.\". I just smiled, shrugged, and turned around to quickly end the conversation. I didnt know they were paying so much attention to me and i started to get scared.\n\nThen fastforward to 2 weeks ago before I left for break, I had a meeting with my school guidance counsleor and told her I had an eating disorder. I was also going to ask how to go about telling my parents but the meeting horribly due to her lack of experience with ED's even though she assured me before we talked she's handle students in the past with this issue. She did absolutely nothing to help me, and gave me some triggering advice. Anyway, since this happend the last day before break I came back to school with a crazy amount of anxiety. She also has my lunch period too. I try to duck and dodge her. I get some relief while sitting down but the anxiety comes back. I get scared the others are staring at me again because I dont eat some weeks, or maybe they think I have a disorder since I turn down food at lunch or stuff the staff give's us. I just chew gum to make it look like im eating or continuously break up my food to make it look like im getting ready to dig in but i still get so scared. Which is probably drawing more attention to myself.",

    "selftext": "TW: >!suicide attempt!< \n\nHoly shit I feel so fucked up. I’m sorry, I’m going to ramble, and sound absolutely insane. \n\nTitle, basically. I started outpatient recovery in October, they had already told me I should really consider inpatient, but I was strongly against it. However, I’ve come to realise that I can’t get myself to feel any kind of motivation to recover, and I can’t do it on my own. \n\nTwo days ago I had my second appointment at the clinic. This time it was with the person overseeing the part where you’re only there for 5 days a week, as I practically begged them to let me join there, as being far away from my house and not being able to leave sounds like hell. At first they agreed, but now they don’t. I’m broken up about it. I felt more at ease with it as well as you had to be a specific BMI to be there, and due to some extreme hunger periods I’d had since starting recovery, I’ve gained a shit ton of weight, and I went from being way under, to way above. \n\nI know this for sure, as on NYE I went to crash my dad’s party, where like three of his friends told me I looked healthier than the pictures they saw of me a few months ago. I feel like death. I also saw a girl there that was so much thinner than I am. \n\nI know how anorexic brains work and that we can be pretty judgemental. I’m terrified that no one’s gonna understand why I’m there, or that I’m gonna be the biggest person in the clinic and that it’ll fuck up my mental health. This is so unhealthy but I’m praying I have to wait for a month or two until I get to go there so I can lose weight and feel like I belong. \n\nI also feel like this isn’t extreme hunger and I’ve just lost my ‘skill’ to restrict. Which feels like a huge loss, as anorexia was a coping mechanism for me to not feel my depression, and it worked. I actually felt happy when I was actively restricting well. Everyone tells me that I wasn’t actually happy, and from a therapy standpoint it sounds about right, but I’ve been dealing with mental health issues for years and I truly, TRULY, felt at peace. I finally felt like I was succeeding at something. \n\nI have no control over anything anymore and that isn’t something I can handle. The feeling of inadequacy and loss of control, knowing that people think I’m getting healthier, even though I’m getting so much worse mentally, caused me to >!attempt suicide!< last Sunday. I regret this decision immensely, I went to the hospital, literally asked all doctors to promise me not to let me die (they aren’t allowed to so they didn’t :(), and I’m really ashamed that I did that. I have a social circle and people that care about me, I’m in a very healthy relationship of almost 5 years, and it felt like a very selfish act. But I was just feeling so exhausted. I’d been crying for 6 days straight and I just couldn’t anymore. \n\n(Btw, I’m okay now. I tried to >!overdose!< got sick, managed to call for help even though I was basically incapable of speaking. I apparently had a seizure, but I have epilepsy so that isn’t surprising. I have no lasting effects besides that my face is insanely beat up and I have two black eyes lmao.)\n\nA big part of me doesn’t even understand why they want me to do inpatient, as I’ve gained so much. I really feel like I don’t belong. They told me it wasn’t even because of the attempt, which really surprised me. They did explain that because I’m just so incredibly tired of everything, they want me to have more intensive care, which a small part of me understands, but I’ve lost the ability to think rationally. \n\nI’ve told a small amount of people around me about everything so far, and everyone’s been very loving and is trying to understand. I appreciate everyone around me so much. But I just needed to vent here, as I don’t think anyone can truly understand unless they have an eating disorder. (Truly happy for them lol) \n\nSorry for rambling & just being a mess. I don’t know how to sound less neurotic right now. I just don’t know how to calm myself down and how to rationalise. ",

I'm at significant risk of breaking my spine at even a very gentle fall. I'm 36 with the bones of an 80+ year old. I am now starting HRT and I really, *really* need to start prioritising my food intake.\n\nI am a mother of two and most of my free time with my children is spent in the forest, climbing trees and hiking. My life and that of my children could be irreversibly changed were I to break my spine.\n\nToday I am sad for what I've done to myself and angry. I was failed by so many GPs and psychiatrists when I asked what my options were to treat my osteoporosis or to help restore bone density. They shrugged their shoulders.

I've been in a few quite bad relationships before him that made my self image and anxiety the worst it's ever been, and because of this i very often feel like i don't deserve the love i have now because I've gained weight.

I think they came back because I'm under a lot of stress right now with my uni degree and so is my boyfriend, and while we've been on Xmas break we were doing long distance which further made things harder, but it's made me feel like he's not talking to me as much because he's realising that I'm fat or ugly.

    "selftext": "Hello, I have struggled with anorexia since I was 13 and essentially lost 8 years of my life to placing my identity in being thin until I had a death scare at 18. I’m now 21 and somewhat recovered. However my eating disorder stemmed from my mother placing me on diets at 13 during puberty and also degrading me and constantly comparing myself to my younger self who was “more active, sporty, bubbly, thinner, wore more girly clothes, was more feminine etc.” and also degrading the fact I was in puberty and became withdrawn, less active and placing on weight to the point where looking back I wasn’t fat but I was fluffy. Additionally she compared me to other girls of my age and how my attire became less feminine and less revealing than other girls. Essentially honing in- I wasn’t like other girls and I wasn’t good enough\nDespite this, my mother believes my eating disorder was essentially my doing and due to the fact I was weak and felt insecure about other girls and has not learned anything from it.\n\nThe issue is, I have a sister who is now also 13 and I can see the cycle being laid out for her as well. She is  the same as I was during that age- went from being active, chatty etc. as a child and now prefers to spend her time within her room playing video games etc with her friends and like I was at that age- my usual food intake wasn’t the healthiest but I didn’t care much about what I ate. My mother already is now constantly shaming her for not dressing like other teenagers of her age, acting too boyish and also constantly comparing her to how she was before puberty to how she is now. Additionally when my mother does get her to do exercise and walk she shames my sister for not wanting to do it and calls her unfit and hence again compares her to her pre pubescent self. Lately she has been very much on about her weight- this time somewhat smart enough to keep that in whispers to my father. However it is clear my mother is very unhappy with my baby sisters weight and will constantly talk to my father about my sisters weight gain during puberty and how it has made her ‘become what she is now’ and that it cant be accepted as just puberty. She is now convinced she is “overweight” despite being a size 10-12 Aus/ 6-8 US. I have barked on to her constantly that by trying to fix her weight or breaking her down for how she has changed throughout puberty will not make her change and she doesn’t need changing to begin with and to just let my sister navigate this insanely confusing time which is puberty. Also I bark on about all the usual stuff- don’t discuss diets or food in negative light etc etc. however she does not take what I say to heart. Now she has decided on her own accord and has gotten my father to also assist her in going behind my sisters back and placing her on a strict ‘carnivore/keto’ diet for the next 2 weeks to help her to ‘melt off the fat’. I was not meant to know about this as this was meant to be an inside job however I was informed by my father that this is what my mother is implementing now as she knows I would be against it and confront her. I know this is a long post but essentially I’m seeking advice and guidance on what I can do to either get through to my mother or help my sister. As the cycle I went through is essentially flashing before my eyes as not only is my mother enforcing the same shame and beliefs she placed on me at that age- but she also was exposed to my ed when I was sick so it’s a nasty concoction awaiting to set alight. I don’t want her to develop an Ed like myself and also have her teenage years and identify stolen away from her. I don’t know what to do and I am truly scared for my sister. I always speak positive to her and always uplift her when she comes to me about body concerns or concerns about my mothers comments but I don’t know what else I can do to protect her. Please could I get some advice- I truly don’t know what to do. As I know if I confront my mother or even if my father confronts my mother itll just end in an argument where she won’t listen to anything and paint me or the person confronting her as a self centred asshole. \n\nThank you so much for reading this- I just feel extremely scared for my sisters sake and don’t want her to help in creating another child with an Ed.

It's nuanced-- i saw that through her desire to make her mom happy, vy for her father's attention, her fear of growing up... the first time i went through recovery, i truly believed i was fully and wholly recovered. but i never addressed any underlying issues i had. it was the same. eating, not exercising, gaining weight... and as my mom always told me \"the first thing to go when you don't eat is your brain.\" but there's so much more to that. it's that constant desire to be better. to chase something further. to exist in a smaller body because you fully are convinced you hate yourself so deeply, and that less of you means there is more room for you to be loved. i realized i have A LOT of issues that i havent addressed during the first two times i underwent recovery. it was always talking about the stress of high school, the issues with parents... stupid things that therapy proved to be too expensive for. my biggest regret is that i didn't dive deeper and challenge myself more during my sessions. now i'm a freshman in college and i know i'm royally about to f-up if i don't address my root issues. but why is it easier casting them aside and drowning yourself in this constant cycle of self-hatred and attaining something you know is unsustainable? do i really hate myself that deeply? i think that the worst part is, nobody truly cares about what you go through because at the end of the day, business is business. you either bring your best performance, or you fail. universities dont care, professors dont care if you miss a deadline because you were up frantically puking or running while your roommates are gone for a few hours. \n\ngod i'm literally freaking out right now. i think reading jennette's memoir forced me to confront the fact that despite the impression i give out to my friends-- this confident person who care about health-- is a total fucking sham. i actually hate myself. i feel that any time i feel remotely happy, that i'm doing something wrong... that i could be doing more in the name of discipline. am i allergic to happiness? i still dont fully understand what's going on in my head, and i seriously don't know if i even want to continue to address why i've relapsed. i thought i was past this. i remember promising myself i never wanted to enter that dark place again but here i am.\n\ni dont think ive ever loved myself, despite the illusion i gave to others. the one i continue to give to others i even managed to convince myself that i did.

    "selftext": "I've had a restrictive ED for the last 10 years and have been underweight the whole time. I was hospitalised three years ago at a low point, gained weight, then relapsed this year and went even lower. My mum is tired, which is understandable. She had paid for my therapy, to see a GP and dietician, and I've still not gotten to a healthy weight all this time. She has said she will no longer help financially support me at uni if I do not start taking nutritional supplement drinks and going to an outpatient clinic. But I'm not ready to recover. Luckily for me I started getting government assistance this year due to my age so I can continue study but my refusal has put a major strain on our relationship. I don't feel any animosity towards the ultimatum because I understand but the way she has been acting is destroying me. She continues to tell me how I feel, that I must 'hate her' and 'think she is horrible' because I don't want to talk about how I feel, and gets angry at me for not wanting family support when they have paid for support services, even though they forced me to go there in the first place. And then she asked if I wanted to go back to uni early because I 'never talk and obviously don't want to be at home and only care about study anyway' even though I am quiet by nature, haven't done any work all break, and if I was being quieter than usual it was only because I'm uncomfortable trying to be 'normal' when she is obviously angry at me. Regardless today was her birthday and because despite all this I still love her I wanted to make it a good day for her and we had planned to go to the movies at 12 but on the day she revealed hestitation because the film went over lunch time and she didn't want my younger sister (who is in voluntary ED treatment) missing a meal so I suggested we do something else and she got angry at me as 'everything is always about fucking food' despite the fact that I was only trying to relieve her worry. I ended up yelling back at her because I had spent so much time trying to decipher what she wanted to do and organising a nice present for her meanwhile she didn't say thank you and was negative about all my ideas. After a cooldown I ended up apologising and we moved on with the day but she never apologised back and i am still harbouring resentment. She told me she is scared that I will cut ties but the only person pushing us apart is her. I try so hard to connect with her but it's never enough, I 'barely speak to them, I only ever talk about uni, I never make time for the Family, I only want them for money' even though I call basically every 1-2 days when I am away at uni, and am so busy with uni because I am trying to shorten my degree, which she complains is taking so long. I want to be able to come home and feel loved, to be hugged like she used to hug me, before it felt like she was stiff and hesitating. I wish I could play board games with her and laugh about things and have fun without her looking at me with disappointed eyes. I wish I could talk about my interests and dreams without every conversation somehow shifting back to food and my weight. But it feels gone. The motherly instinct to protect her child from harm is still there but the mum who loved me is gone. ",

She mostly talks about binging and purging, and how people binge and purge to \"think\" with their bodies. I'm reading the book right now, and right off the bat she says that eating disorders are not a way to punish yourself, theyre a way to help yourself. I don't know about anyone else, but my ED absolutely is a way to punish myself. I agree that b/p can be used as a way to emotionally regulate oneself, but she seems to be talking about it as if it's the only reason people do it. She also talks about how b/p ing is a way for people to \"feel\" the emotions that they don't have access to. I personally just feel like this isn't relevant. I can feel my emotions and often do. I've been in mental health treatment for other things besides my ED for years and have learned the skills she talks about being the \"correct\" way of treating b/p EDs. I still have my ED.\n\nI think my main issue with her work isn't that her theories aren't relevant to some people. My issue is that she writes about them as if they apply to every person with this type of ED. Her idea of \"un-covery\" feels like a rebranding of basic CBT stuff. ",

I stayed because I love him, and he’s in therapy but I have no hope and I would never marry him. Since May I lost over >!40!< pounds and I am now underweight.

    "selftext": "Backstory: 33F with a history of BED and OSFED (atypical ANA with binge purge subtype). I began my recovery journey in 2018 and I haven't been to a higher level of care for my ED since 2021. Never fully recovered from behaviors but also quite stable the last couple of years with a lapse here and there. Over the course of treatment, I have gained a substantial amount of body weight. The past year, my weight has been stable according to my dietitian (I haven't check my weight personally since 2019). I have yet to find body neutrality and I struggle with accepting my weight. \n\nTo the chase: I have a strong urge to fully relapse in order to control my weight. I recently began using old behaviors to track intake, thought about purchasing a scale (haven't had one since 2018), and I am feeling old fears around food and my behaviors. I told my dietitian about this today and while she strongly discourages these behavioral changes, she always allows me to work through things myself too, which I appreciate. \n\nI feel confused and lost and scared because I genuinely want to relapse, and I don't want to 1. Let my treatment team down, 2. I don't want my fairly strict ED-focused therapist to drop me, which has been a conversation before, and 3. I don't want to go back to residential. I know these behaviors hurt me and that being in my ED feels terrible and I hate it . . . But I love it at the same time!\n\nI don't know what my next move will be and I'm terrified. I'm afraid to relapse, and I'm feeling completely disgusted with myself and my body too. ",

Do not speak negatively about recovery or discourage others from seeking help for their eating disorders.  \n>  \n>RULE 3: **TRIGGER WARNINGS AND SPOILERS**  \n>  \n>Do not put numbers in the title of your post. Use the TW: Numbers flair if the body of your post contains numbers related to weight or calories. Use spoilers to cover numbers in all posts and comments.

    "title": "Transitions between Disordered Eating ",
    "selftext": "I’m black. I have always had insane curves, everything that people are dying to have nowadays. \n\nHowever, I’ve always wanted to be waifish and androgynous and delicate. I was envious of these tiny pale people with flat chests and no curves. I saw them as pure, and lovely. I wanted that. I wanted to be worthy of being treasured, I wanted to be as fragile as I felt inside. I wanted to be nurtured and coddled instead of sexualized and belittled.\n\nYears ago I thought I made a healthy decision in realizing that my body type would never be the way I wanted it to be. I decided I deserved to see people who look like me in the spaces that I was a part of (disordered eating social media). And for that reason I started searching for “inspirational photos” of people with my shape, body type, height, style, skin color and hair type. And then I took it further because I didn’t see other ethnicities either. \n\nI think I kind of kickstarted the POC/BIPOC ED thinspo “movement”. I can’t take credit for all of it obviously but before I started my little tumblr page and made my own tags etc, there were little to no photos of nonwhite thin people. No one interacted with me, but after I started posting, more and more people started using my tags and the images I posted ended up being everywhere. My account got banned and I went into recovery not long after that.\n\nOn one hand I have immense pride in what I did, but on the other I know how awful it is that I had a part in “enabling others” with my posts. It’s a weird feeling.\n\nNow though, I’m disordered again, but on the opposite end of the spectrum. I feel so ashamed and disgusting. But I can’t trigger myself anymore into restriction. I’ve been through a lot of trauma since the height of my restriction phase. I’ve gained everything back, and then some.\n\nI miss being empowered by my restriction. I miss the control. I miss how on top of it I was back then? I was organized, clean, people liked me more, I journaled, made to do lists, exercised constantly, read books for enjoyment, read for self improvement. Even though I was hungry and all I thought about was planning meals and navigating not eating… I was obsessed with food but I wasn’t a slave to it like I am now. My cognition was so much better then. Everything was better. \n\nIt’s hard for me to see the restrictive behavior as bad honestly. I know what I was doing to my body, I did it in the “healthiest” way possible. I know/knew the detrimental consequences of my behavior, but when i compare my life with and without restriction I just… How can it be so bad when things were so much better for me then.\n\nBinge eating is the most miserable thing ever. I hate myself more now than I did then. I’m not able to connect with others as a friend or a romantic partner. I don’t want to eat but it’s all I do? It’s partially to soothe myself or occupy time but it’s also kind of a stim for me. I don’t feel “okay” when I don’t have a variety of tastes or textures to “enjoy”. Now, life is so miserable that I only get enjoyment out of food since I can’t really do anything else anymore for a variety of reasons. But I don’t enjoy it fully because I’m filled with disgust and guilt and shame during/after I eat.\n\nI want my life back. I can’t wrap my mind around this idea that my old behavior was bad. Especially since I was never underweight, and my body was never scary looking like I wanted it to be. I’m still causing harm to myself physically now after all with binge eating, but now my life sucks too. If I’m going to be physically unwell, I’d at least like to have the control back and feel comfortable in my body again.\n\nI feel broken because I’m suffering even more emotionally, socially, physically etc than I was back then, but I can’t get it back. I feel worthless and unattractive. I don’t feel confident or capable of making positive changes when I can’t control my eating. I’m trapped in this loop of suffering.\n\nI’m not trying to glamorize restriction, it definitely sucked in a variety of ways that we all know about. Recovery was good for me. I just wanted a space to speak my truth/vent on what I’m dealing with. \n\nI don’t really see people talk about what recovery looks like from binge eating when you’ve become medically obese. I don’t know how to lose weight without restriction or being obsessed with exercise etc. How do people just… lose weight normally. And be normal about food? \n\nNo one takes me seriously about disordered eating because I’m huge now. It’s so alienating and frustrating to navigate. Especially in such a fatphobic society. It’s like it’s a personal failure and not a disorder, even to doctors, therapists, and nutritionists.",

    "selftext": "My son (early 20s) recently came back home & I have noticed he goes to the bathroom after nearly every meal. I know for a fact that he threw up once because I found vomit in the garbage. He told me he thought something he ate hadn’t agreed with him, & I really want to believe him. But as the days go on, I’m noticing a definite pattern of him visiting the bathroom shortly after every meal. Sometimes a few times an hour. I don’t want him to think I’m hovering, so I decided just to keep notes on when I notice the behavior. But today, I heard him coughing (gagging?) in the bathroom, so I went up and asked if he was ok. He, somewhat annoyed, said, “I was just coughing.”\n\nWe have had some struggles over the past year or so, and I’m just so glad he’s home. I don’t want to do anything to upset him, but I’m really worried about his health. His well-being is of the utmost importance to me. Does anyone have any advice?\n\nAdditional info—for the past couple years he thought he had a problem with lactose intolerance. When cutting out dairy didn’t seem to eliminate the problem, I took him to a gastroenterologist who did a endoscopy & colonoscopy, both of which came back normal. \n\nI know he has used marijuana in the past, and I worried that maybe his stomach troubles were coming from cannabanoid syndrome. Perhaps they still are. But now I’m worried he might actually have an eating disorder. Please help!  I would do anything to help my son get healthy. ",

    "selftext": "My GF was diagnosed with anorexia, binge-purging subtype.  We met after her last time in treatment.  She seemed to do okay for a while.  I didn't notice any issues, but I wasn't too familiar with the signs and symptoms of her disease.  Now that I have read up more thoroughly, all of the signs were there.\n\nShe wasn't losing that much weight.  She had always been thin, and was recently looking much thinner, but not scarily so.  A lot of weird things were happening though.  She would have nights where she would send me these illegible, very off texts.  I figured it was because she was drinking, but now I know it has to do with periods of confusion brought on by malnutrition and heart issues.  I think now I can remember her cheeks being swollen.  She had dry skin and was always cold.  She would just not remember things that we talked about recently.\n\nAnyway, I had gone over to her house randomly last Wednesday and her roommate let me in.  I walked into her room like covered in food and trash.  Literally shit everywhere.  I knew immediately something wasn't right.  I comforted her, threw out all the trash, and talked to her about treatment.  She agreed and I called her mom who got the process started.  They said it would be like 4 weeks till their was room, but she was going to call on Monday to see if she could get in sooner.\n\nI didn't hear from her all day Saturday.  She was going through a lot, and thought she needed space.  She also had a habit of sleeping during the day for like 10 hours at a time when she wasn't working. Her mom hadn't called me or her roommates so I didn't really worry.  I had told her everything was going to be fine I was just proud of her for agreeing to go to treatment.  \n\nI didn't hear from her on Sunday either.  I texted her a bunch and also called her parents.  I gave them her roommates number to check in on her.  Even at that point, I was just worrying about her mental health.  I didn't think she was at risk for dying or anything.\n\nOn Monday her roommate called me and told me the news.  They found her dead.  I'm guessing it was due to heart issues from all the purging and restricting.  I don't know.  I'm just devastated and don't know who to talk to about it.  Despite this disease, she was a truly amazing person.  She was honest and kind and genuine and all we ever did together was laugh.  She was only 24.  I didn't know this disease could strike so suddenly. \n\nI feel so guilty.  I wish I would have read up more about her disease and acted sooner.  I just want to crawl into bed and die.",

    "selftext": "TW: predatory (?) behavior \n\nWhen I was in high school, I was suffering with anorexia. I was reported to my school from a few teachers and students. I was sent down to the guidance office to have a talk. \n\nWell, the guidance counselor was a male. He didn’t believe that I had a disorder unless I took my clothes off. My advisor was also in the room, and she thought I should remove my clothes as well. I always wore baggy clothes so no one could see my body. He asked, “That’s what anorexics do, isn’t it? We have to make sure you aren’t too underweight so take off your clothes”. \n\nThe awful thing was, I was going to. I was ready to take off my clothes because I was so scared. My parents were out of town, and they threatened to send me in a mental hospital. The guidance counselor and advisor said they had a police officer ready to take me the mental hospital. I was terrified. \n\nI was about to take my clothes off, and they were so excited for me to do so. But my saving grace walked through the door. My school nurse was called in for my little meeting, but they forgot about that. She screamed at them for telling me to take my clothes off. She stopped me from doing it.\n\nI felt so disgusted with myself that I was about to do that. I feel disgusted now that they are still working at my high school after I graduated. I wish I said something. I wish I wasn’t such a coward. \n\nDo not let people get away witch treating you like crap if you have a disorder. You’re not a freak at a freak show. You are not an experiment.  Do not let people abuse you. Speak up and say no.",

Obviously underweight people are running recipe blogs and encourage others to follow along with their “wellness journey” while they drop pound after pound. Teenagers are chugging vinegar to curb their appetite. TikTok is chock full of “diet tips” that could have come straight from a circa-2005 forum post written by tinythinbutterflygirl94. \n\nBefore pro ana was more or less banned from the internet, people like this knew they were disordered and healthy outsiders knew not to take their advice because they knew they were disordered as well. Nobody went around praising anorexia as a healthy lifestyle; it was widely recognized as a choice to live to an unhealthy one. Now, these behaviors are socially acceptable and considered normal and healthy by your average person. While obviously not everyone who partakes in these behaviors is disordered, these ~tips n tricks~ are definitely less than healthy and were not mainstream before this shift. When these unhealthy behaviors had the bite of being labeled “pro ana” attached to them, they were much, much less dangerous to your average viewer. \n\nWhen we said that it would be incredibly damaging to force pro ana folks to go incognito, they said it was just our ~disordered delusions~ and we were ~trying to manipulate people.~ They said they knew best about the kind of life that some of us have been living for longer than these websites have been around, and now society is paying the price.",

It’s made me feel even worse about my body and my existence.\n\nthese “body positive” models usually are about 5-15 lbs overweight at most and still have a perfect waist to hip ratio, and not to mention a beautiful face. Although they may face oppression and discrimination in the modeling industry they would be worshipped in normal society.\n\nIt’s like these models are only allowed ONE flaw. If she has vitiligo, she has to be beautiful and thin. If she’s fat, she has to be beautiful and an hourglass. If she has a large nose, she has to have every other facial feature and her body make up for it. \n\nIt’s even with actresses and other celebrities. When people say Jennifer Lawrence and Marylin Monroe are “body positive role models” I get dysphoric as fuck because they’re both way smaller and way more shapely than I could ever hope to be. I heard someone on the view say Kim Kardashian was a hero for women with big butts and thighs. I’m sorry, WHAT? I have a large ass and huge thighs and I’ve never felt empowered by a woman with a waist half the size of mine.\n\nLastly, it seems like the body positive movement is first and foremost becoming mainstream because they want to sell you something. Plus size clothes, makeup to “enhance” rather than conceal your beauty, the industry still preys on insecurities as much as it always have but is now peddling them as acceptance. \n\nI think we should stop trying to expand the definition of beauty. Not everyone is beautiful and that’s okay. Your worth is not determined by how physically attractive you are.",

She told me my chubby cheeks made me look like a squirrel when I smiled.

How could my brother be so athletic while I ballooned each year in this household where carbs were practically a reincarnation of the devil himself? When he found the empty ice cream containers and chocolate wrappers he told me I was disgusting. He said he was embarrassed to tell people I was his daughter. \n\nWhen I was fat I bought an expensive jumpsuit for a big upcoming party. I spent hours perfecting my hair and makeup, I squeezed into heels so that my legs could look long. When I got there the boy I liked looked me up and down, turned to his friend and  loudly whispered “fat b****”. They laughed and left and I wished I could fall through the floor. When I got home that night I cried because I was a shy nerdy girl and I couldn’t imagine what I had done to make him say that. \n\nI thought I used food to control my emotions but really I was controlled by food. \n\nEvery night when my family had gone to sleep I’d pull out thousands of calories from underneath my bed.

I’ve basically switched to a restriction ED, largely driven by the comments of people around me. \n\nAnd today the boy who called me a ”fat b****” asked me out for dinner after over a year of not seeing each other. He said I looked great and he wondered why we didn’t talk more in high school. I wanted to break down and yell at him for ruining my self esteem. I wanted him to know how many nights I had spent crying over his careless words. But instead smiled and said I was happier leaving the past in the past.\n\nI don’t know why I wrote this, I guess I’m just frustrated with how the world works.

    "title": "I did some research on the BMIs people with EDs usually die at. It made me really sad, but I figured I’d share that info here due to how hard it is to come by accurate numbers on",
    "selftext": "I’m hoping that by sharing it here I can minimize harm in some way. I looked at any study I could find with numbers. These are the BMIs of people who died despite hospital treatment and everyone doing their best to save them, so keep that in mind. I'm looking at the extreme limits of the human body here.\n\nThe BMIs that were lowest at death on average were the restrictive-subtype anorexics without any (listed) comorbid conditions (also not including suicides). Most died somewhere in the 10s to 12s. Maintaining a BMI under ~15 for an extended period of time seemed to increase risk of death a lot. Out of a study of 23, one anorexic made it to 9.1, this is the lowest BMI I’ve found in any study. They died of cardiac arrest. One died of broncho-pneumonia at 16.8. In another study, others who died at “higher” BMIs died from gastrointestinal hemorrhage or septic shock (assuming from laxative abuse?), seizures, diabetes, or pneumonia/infections. Occasionally restrictive anorexics died from electrolyte imbalances at higher BMIs as well. The most common cause of death for this group  was cardiovascular/cardiac arrest or organ failure.\n\nNext lowest on average were the binge-purge subtypes, and alcoholic anorexics of any subtype. Apparently alcoholism is very common along with EDs and deaths from a combo of the two seem to happen often. Benzodiazepines were another commonly abused drug leading to a higher likelihood of death. Another study mentioned alcohol abuse as the biggest predictor of death, especially when combined with an underweight BMI. Purging is also, obviously, terrible for you and causes heart issues and electrolyte imbalances that often lead to death. There was a greater range here, and those who died from something other than suicide died anywhere between a BMI of ~10 to 19.7. A few were listed as having a “normal” appearance at death after previously having gotten down to a very low BMI, though the specific BMIs of these was not recorded.\n\nThe last part makes me possibly the saddest. About half the deaths were from suicide, and it was the largest single cause of death. This included Bulimics, anorexics of any subtype, and EDNOS/OSFED. Suicides were relatively common among every group, but it looked like those who binge and purge were at the greatest risk of suicide overall. They died anywhere from the 12s to overweight.\n\nSo those are the statistics I’ve found. Obviously this is only including deaths and not even mentioning the painful side-effects and health conditions resulting from EDs that usually start at much higher BMIs. Do **not** think your ED is any less serious just because of any of these numbers, these are literally the ultimate extremes and I was intentionally filtering things to look for people who died at lower BMIs. The majority of ED deaths from all causes happened at higher BMIs than the extremes I’ve listed.\n\nThis is easier said than done I know, but if you don’t want to die a painful death then don’t drink or abuse drugs, don’t purge, and don’t get to an extremely low BMI. Keep your electrolytes in check. Most importantly, get your mental health taken care of. EDs are extremely deadly, devastating, and horrible for both your mental and physical health. Deaths from them and the unhealthy behavior surrounding it can pretty much happen at any weight.\n\nLinks:\n\n[1](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.researchgate.net/figure/The-23-deceased-patients-listed-by-cause-of-death-and-lowest-BMI-prior-to-admission_tbl2_51032013/amp)\n [2](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/1107207)\n [3](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5db9/caf029b3b69b3a9378eb4a9c324e3680fe33.pdf)\n [4](https://www.ennonline.net/fex/15/limits)\n [5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4120076/#!po=0.877193)\n [6](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1600-0447.2010.01627.x?casa_token=MNzvE2NToa4AAAAA%3AscySeU5F96npYVQG03DqGPLpEIeDPv8EiZuI3xYFSmuGRnH_9oLa-z8HsCOfe-Dh2m6byAALjl8SZpQ)\n [7](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/articlepdf/1107207/yma15002_724_731.pdf)\n [8](https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.silk.library.umass.edu/doi/full/10.1046/j.1440-1819.2001.00880.x)\n [9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6003111/)\n [10](https://ugeskriftet.dk/files/scientific_article_files/2018-08/b5380.pdf)\n [11](https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.silk.library.umass.edu/doi/full/10.1002/erv.2178)\n [12](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1751-0759-5-14)\n [13](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/144/6/e20192339)",

    "selftext": "Today I learnt about some of the history of eating disorders and ngl it's really interesting, especially seeing as anorexia nervosa is mostly documented from the 20th century onwards. \n\nAnorexia Mirabilis is from the middle ages and was basically where women and girls would starve themselves for God, as a sign of divinity. It was mostly Catholics that did it, but reading into some of the cases their behaviour mirrors the behaviour of many of us. \n\nCatherine of Siena had it, and she apparently learnt it from her sister (so clearly it ran in families) who used it to control her husband (control seems to be a theme). Catherine herself died from it, and it was recorded that if forced to eat, she would purge. \n\nColumba of Rieti is another example, and she also died from it, and she also engaged in self harm behaviours under the guise of religion. \n\nDuring the Victorian era there were 'fasting girls' who were often teenagers who claimed they were miracles who didnf require nutrition, one case was a twelve year old girl who stopped eating when she was ten. She was taken under medical supervision to see if she was genuine, where her parents then wouldn't allow her to eat even though doctors said she was dying, as they believed she was holy. She did die, and they were charged with manslaughter. \n\nIt seems many fasting girls would secretly eat, whilst claiming they did not. Which mirrors the secret eating of many sufferers of eating disorders today, with the shame so many of us feel around eating and the irrational need to hide it when we do eat. \n\nSome of the fasting girls would also have stigmata, which is the Christian word for wounds or scars in the same place Jesus had crucifixion wounds, which sounds to me like self harm, a behaviour many people today with eating disorders have.\n\nI just find it fascinating that for centuries it wasn't seen as a mental illness, but as a sign of religious devotion and that by using religion, sufferers had an excuse. It shows that while people claim it's all about the media and it's a 21st century and a first world problems- it clearly isn't as there have been clear cases of eating disorders dating back centuries, with self harm often being present at the same time. While the reasons for the disorders and the way they present themselves may have changed, eating disorders have clearly been a phenomenon for centuries and I find that fascinating ngl.",

My one source of comfort during the day. The local drive through SBs has gotten it wrong on occasion, leading to a lot of tears etc.\n\nA few months ago, he explained to the woman whilst waiting that I had pretty severe AN, hence why he always had to double check that everything was perfect, otherwise it could be majorly upsetting for me. She sympathised and said she'd watched her sister start to slip into a potential restrictive disorder, but thankfully she hasn't spiraled too far.\n\nAnyway, now a few of the baristas know my order off by heart, and why it has to be so specific. He was waiting today while they brewed the filter and the person at the window explained they actually only let those specific people make my drink, who know how & why, because they don't want to upset me and want to make sure it's always correct. He came home and had the above message written on my cup, and it just really made my day. It was really nice knowing how thoughtful they are, and understanding.\n\nSorry for the ramble, I just have nobody to share this with and I found it really sweet 😞\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit:** Thank you everyone, I forwarded on the comments to my dad & will also write to SB to name the branch & hopefully they'll get some worthy praise <3\n\nAlso, my dad has been incredible.

As a kid I'd say I ate normally, always had a sweet tooth though, which is something I've come to hate now. Then it feels like out of nowhere, like literally overnight, I lost all ability to eat normally. No joke, ever since around my 13th birthday were I suddenly developed a huge ass appetite it feels like I've completely lost the ability to eat normally. In my teen years I would be insanely hungry all the time and eating entire bags of chips on the regular and taking large portion sizes at dinner because my stomach felt like this huge black hole. I wouldn't call them binges by any means because I could always stop when I was full and never felt out of control but for whatever reason my body kept demanding food. Eating a \"normal\" serving size of anything and feeling satisfied, that ability stopped coming naturally to me at all. \n\nAt the time I didn't think much of it and assumed it was because I was growing or whatever but looking back on it has made me flabbergasted. It's a miracle I only became overweight at 17 and not any earlier, and to be honest the reason why I was probably staying at a decent weight in my early teens while eating so much processed junk food is because I didn't eat breakfast or even lunch very regularly (not because of any disordered stuff, back then I mainly skipped breakfast because I wanted to sleep in a little extra before school). \n\nAnd now that the pendulum has swung in the other direction and I'm in my early twenties and I've developed an ED, lost all that extra weight and feel afraid of even perfectly reasonable healthy food it's made things more confusing. It really feels like I have to live with this disorder that makes me miserable and cold and makes me miss out on seeing family and friends as a price to pay to stay skinny, because if I didn't and went back to eating more I'd slide back into being overweight way too easily. \n\nSorry if a lot of what I wrote seems disjointed and doesn't make much sense, having a bit of a shit moment right now and mainly wanted to know if anyone else felt similiar and if I'm wrong for never wanting to recover.",

Yes?? Do you not see the dichotomy??? Do you not see the irony???\n\nHe did it again yesterday when I saw him and I haven't stopped thinking about it since.

My disordered brain is now saying, \"if he's proud now then he'll be so proud when you reach x lbs.\" Which is chaotic and idiotic.\n\nHe has always had issues with his weight and has always dated women with issues.

As if I give a shit that he thinks Angelina Jolie is too thin. \n\nIs it any wonder why I grew up obsessed with my body and was dieting from the age of 7? I was surrounded by misinformed diet culture and judgement about physicalities.\n\nI just wish he understood the effect his comments and focuses have on people. I wish he understood that not everyone looks at weight loss comments as a positive as he does and that it can be hurtful and uncomfortable. I dread seeing him when I know I've lost weight now even though I love him and miss him.\n\nNo conversation with him about it ever sticks because he either forgets the conversation or it gets filtered through his own biases and he gets the wrong message from it or he just laughs it off.\n\nEdit: idk why there is a bullet point in my title but it's driving me crazy 😂",

As long as 2/3 are safe - challenge yourself with something NOT safe. \n\nNot only does this encourage eating non-safe foods in a healthy way, it really helps deflect a binge if you stick to it. \n\nI hope this helps y’all as much as it’s been helping me!!

Not like “yikes haha that’s a bad picture”, but like it actually really fucking upsets me and is super distressing and can send me spiralling and will destroy my mood for days. Even a couple years ago the day I got my senior photos back in HS I ended up with alcohol poisoning in the ER getting a psych eval because it made me so depressed I drank myself nearly to death. If I’m out with people and someone takes a picture of me, I feel like I just shut down. Like any happiness just gets sucked out of me when I’m reminded of how I look. If I see someone trying to take one, I literally have to cover up my face and as much of myself as possible while begging for them to stop. So why does no one ever respect when I say don’t take a picture ??? The number of times I’ve unexpectedly seen myself on someone else’s snap story and had to plead with them to remove it, or friends who randomly send me pics they took of me when I wasn’t paying attention (like hm just gonna check snap- aaaaaand Im miserable now) Or the girls who want to take selfies together and won’t take no for an answer. Even just the other day hanging out with my friend and her boyfriend, he refused to stop trying to take dumb little videos of us until I was literally curled up with my face in my knees and my hands covering my head and his girlfriend made him stop. I hate it because I always seem like I’m the one being difficult or who ‘killed the vibe’ but if people just respected the first time I told them not to then this wouldn’t have been an issue? But everyone thinks they can like convince me? People are always like “stop oh c’mon you look fine I won’t even send it to anyone please you don’t even know anyone on my acc I don’t have many friends I promise!! Why? Please? Why won’t you? It’s just me! Stop just come take one!” like WHY CANT YOU TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER! Or I’ve met quite a few people who found out I hated pictures and then would turn it into their “” game “” to try and take pictures of me before I could cover my face or grab their phone away. It’s not fucking funny that you “got me”. People are like “but you take selfies though” uhm yes at one very specific angle in good lighting fully makeup-ed and with a filter? Bc that’s the only way I can feel remotely good about myself for .6 seconds?

This is not the oppression olympics, sure but, please just look around. you KNOW, that fatness is so villainzed, otherwise we all wouldn't be sitting here struggling with food and self-image. The majority of us, in this subreddit, want to be thin. And you know it.\n\nmaybe this is a very emotionally charged post but i am tired of the \"woe is me\".\nI've been on both sides of the scale. people would talk over me, would stand in a cirlce in a way that would exclude me, would invalidate my feelings, not care about my opinion or outright ridicule my opinion when i was on the heavier side.\nand don't even get me started on the dating aspect. The threatment is worlds apart with how everyone acted when I was my thinnest and I am not the only one that can attest, I've talked to numerous people whose weight has fluctuated a lot and they'll tel you the same thing. even when you spew the dumbest thing you can muster, if you're skinny, someone listens.\n\nwe ALL know the beauty standard, it's engraved in our brains, and we ALL know it's thinness. especially now that 90s and 2000s styles are coming back and people wear low rise jeans and crop tops. especially now that asian media is merging with western media, now that kpop is popular wherein idols are ALL underweight. especially now that summer is coming or has come and we're all expected to wear less and show more and everyone's talking about beach bodies.\n\nanyways.\n\nEDIT: I just hope you all know that I am NOT saying that the troubles, ridicule, pain, bullying etc. you received directly because of your thinness weren‘t real - they 100% were. but saying it's the same as, or even worse than what OW people deal with, is like comparing apples with oranges. faphobia is systemic and denying that is silly.\n\nyes, it all depends on where exactly you live and what kinds of people you're surrounded with as well as age, gender etc., it can vary! but the majority of the world is fatphobic; I can easily mention more than just the plain ridicule and disrespect like the little amount of options of clothes to choose from, or the little to no /healthy/ representation in media, etc. but I digress.\n\nI think it's easiest understood if you, like many, have been on both sides of the scale as well; and unless you've never been there, you won't understand the gravity of our words.",

(https://jeatdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2050-2974-1-37) None of that 600-800 BS. It’s harmful to tell others that their BMR can be that low, it makes people believe they HAVE to low restrict and whatnot. you’re not invalid if you do restrict to those low numbers but i’m tired of people arguing that a full body scan is super accurate and you HAVE to believe their specific anecdote about the bod pod scan they got done. It’s never gonna be totally accurate, because it’s not. Your beloved DEXA scans always underestimate your BMR so there is no way I believe that your BMR is below 900 cals (http://www.dishlab.org/pubs/LowryTomiyamaBodPod.pdf)\n\nFURTHERMORE, indirect calorimetry (the method used in the first study) has high variability in the ill population and time of day, food and water intake, heartrate, blood pressure, and breath rate all impacts those readings (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0148607197021003168?casa_token=0ZVBihw10ZgAAAAA:AmGoHoVgV6_yD3uZquXVlVpN4YN-Ca4OJvgqVfB-oM0hx-BuootTFQ3NwSO-C3PQjkyGH293njhekyc) \n\nJust note that in the first study I cited, those at the lowest end of 4000 kJ burned at rest did NO exercise.

Not even walking. \n\nI’m studying medicine and have done independent studies in undergrad on this stuff while being super anorexic (still am lmaooo) but to keep promoting low metabolisms and say you’ll gain weight if you restrict to 800 cals is BS. \n\nand I’m 4’8” and underweight so you’d be hardpressed to find someone shorter than me and with a lower metabolism, and I STILL lost weight on 800 cal a day \n\nsorry if this is aggressive i’m trying to save some lives here",

Girls upset because their boyfriend or guy they like follows a ton of Instagram models, famous female TikTok’ers, skinny girls, big booty girls, whatever the case and they themselves look nothing like that.\n\nHonestly? I find it sad if a grown man does that shit. I would be embarrassed if my friends and family saw my following list and it’s full of porn stars or something 😂 Do they have no shame? No, they don’t. If he’s a teen, it’s more understandable but if y’all are out of high school and still like men like this…it’s not worth it. \n\nWe have to remember that the majority are heavily edited. Even videos, there’s body filters, often times very subtle filters as well that most people would not notice. If you don’t want to admit this, fine, let’s pretend they don’t use filters. It’s still embarrassing for a man to simp over girls online. They would not look at him twice  and here he is like “😍” in her comments. \n\nMaybe you’re thinking well that’s every guy right 😭 Maybe it is. I’m waiting for a cute guy who doesn’t have social media. Or at least only follows boring shit like car guys or something. If this guy doesn’t exist and I have to be single, so be it. \n\nI will never lose sleep over Instagram again. If you fr have to argue with a man over this, he doesn’t deserve to have you. We have enough shit to deal with in this life. You don’t need any man who makes you feel bad in any way. You don’t have to pretend to be the “cool girl” who is “totally chill” with your bf watching porn or looking at Instagram models. I’m not chill, I’m crazy, and that’s fine by me.",

    "selftext": "Like it says, lately I've noticed a few more posts than usual (or maybe its just me) of people venting about lack of support from their partners. \n\nThe part I want to address however, is that lately it seems people are looking for an absolutely unrealistic, selfish, or unhealthy type of support.\n\nIf your partner listens to you vent, tries to offer advice, but tells you it stresses them out when ALL you talk about is your eating disorder, that's on you. That's them trying to be supportive and set boundaries to maintain their own mental health. They can't support you if they're entirely burnt out. They are also a human being that has feelings and triggers and boundaries and you cannot expect them to put all of themselves aside for you 110% of the time, that's absolutely unsustainable and unhealthy.\n\nIf your partner listens to you vent and tries to encourage you to recover or eat or whatever that's not them fucking sabotaging you, that's them being a person who DOESN'T HAVE an eating disorder and is doing their best.\n\nYour partner wants you to be better, to feel better. You can and should talk to them when you're stressed, let them know your triggers and what helps you, but expecting them to be a dumping ground for you to cry and vent at NONSTOP unconditionally every day and not talk about anything else?! \n\nOf course they want to go out to dinner! They love you and want to spend time with you doing something nice! Of course they want to go shopping, see family, watch movies, literally anything! It's not about your eating disorder! It may affect it, and that's on YOU to establish with them in a constructive way, but it is so unbelievably unrealistic and selfish to assume and expect another human being to put their entire life, wants, and needs aside for you one hundred percent of the time.\n\nThis doesn't mean don't talk to them. I've cried into my own partner, gone into hysterics, had fits over dinner, but he and I also have a communication line open where one can say \"I want to support you but am in a bad headspace to do so\" and an understanding that emotional emergencies are different than just needing to vent.\n\nIt's a two way street. The amount of support you are asking for needs to be close to or equal to what you're willing to give. I am not as mentally well as my partner. He supports me emotionally more than I support him. But if he were to reach out and say he needed something from me OR needed a break from me, that is WELL within his right and I would support that.\n\nThey are not your therapist, they are not your caretaker, they also need support FROM you.\n\nYour partner is not your therapist. \nYour partner is not your therapist. \nYour partner is NOT your therapist.\n\noh my god, thank you for reading, this is such a personal gripe for me. carry on.\n\nedit before anyone even says it: oh my god, of course this doesn't apply to abusive relationships. Of course not. And each dynamic is different and you will find your own balance. Don't @ me.

When I gain weight it’s rolls and gut. \n\nFuck off with body positivity if you still look fucking amazing at a bigger size. Fuck you for “loving yourself” when you objectively look stunning and have a model physique.  That’s no struggle. I’ll bet you a million fucking dollars if you got my body type/weight distribution at a bigger size you’d be shoving your fingers down your throat too. Fucking BET. \n\nIntermittent Fasting is going great how are you guys.\n\n\nEdit to expound on my very frustrated rant: \n\nI think there is still a tremendous amount of gate keeping when it comes to society’s body positivity movement. The irony is not lost on me, don’t worry. Within that movement I think some bodies are widely accepted and praised because they have certain characteristics (a flat stomach being one of the most important ones to social media). In my personal opinion it is much, much easier for someone to be accepted by society’s beauty/model standards if they have these certain characteristics. I am frustrated that I do not believe I have any of these characteristics so if I were to do the same thing I would not be held to the same level of beauty as someone with ‘better’ physical attributes. \n\nIf you’re upset with me because you think that I’m disregarding the body positivity movement as a whole I’m afraid that wasn’t the intention of my post. I meant to say some people have it easier in the eyes of social media than others. \n\nIt is frustrating to me that someone who *seemingly* has a really effortless and happy existence who posts about body positivity has had an ‘easier’ struggle than I have, because (even if they had an ED) their body will be more easily accepted than mine would be.

I sometimes envy people whose eating disorders aren't purely restrictive, because for me weight gain (which is always going to end up being necessary) means having to give up disordered eating behaviours completely. That really sucks when it's a crutch you're heavily reliant on, and it makes weight restoration/recovery in general very easy to get burned out on.

It still kind of consumes most of my life, but I’ve gained like 7 lbs during this quarantine and am trying to do self recovery. \n\nAnd honestly, whenever I see an extremely skinny woman that kind of reminds me of how I used to be, I kind of have empathy now, more than jealousy. It used to be, “fucking shit I wish I was that skinny.” But now I think, I know you’re not ok.. I know you’re always cold, fighting that hunger, restricting your calories by restricting the value of your life, the relationships you could have, the experiences you could cherish, etc.. I hope you’re ok even if you don’t have an ED. \n\nI’m 27 now and this quarantine really has gotten me to think what I really want the rest of my life to be. \n\nYeah, the healthy woman might be fuller, not have an extreme thigh gap, but still takes care of herself and works out/eats “healthily” most of the time. She doesn’t think twice about getting a donut from the break room because she knows she can have them whenever she wants. She can have one or two donuts and be ok and not feel the need to finish the entire box because she’s well nourished and not starved. She can go get last minute brunch with her friends and be excited to see her friends, not be anxious about it because she already ate her breakfast and didn’t plan for it, or try to come up with an excuse to not go. \n\nI’m jealous of the women who can go to farmers markets with their friends and eat the samples and not tally up the calories from it. I’m jealous of how they have an active social life and can enjoy wine and a charcuterie board every now and then without starving themselves the whole day for it or flaking the last minute. Who can order pizza and have a date night in watching Netflix. And enjoy a couple slices then move on with their life. There’s sooo much more but that’s what I can think of right now.",

She's so happy because she and her partner have been trying for a long time, and even though I'm happy for her, I can't help myself to also be furious.\n\nMy mom also had an eating disorder while she gave birth to me and she fully recovered when I was about 2 years old. I know this had a great impact on the way I look at food now. Knowing someone is ACTIVELY trying to have a baby while being so heavily disordered is so selfish to me. It's not realistic to say she'll be recovered in 9 months either, so you just know this baby will be confronted with eating disordered behaviour in the first developing stages of their life. Even small disordered things will impact a newborn. She's very young, so saying it's now or never is not an excuse.\n\nOnce again, this might press the wrong buttons for some people and I'm genuinely sorry if I'm hurting anyone with this post.

So much more than downloading Tumblr and deciding to fast.\n\nIf you think you're less valid, or that you're a wannarexic, that you gave yourself this disorder, just know that you're not a fake.

It's not something mild like a norovirus type stomach flu where your body ejects food from both ends and you lose weight from an involuntary fast. I know this disorder puts macabre ideas in our heads where something like that sounds helpful, at least in the abstract, but that is not what this is.\n\nI have a mild case by all accounts, and even so, I can't recall the last time I felt this horrible. For context, last year I underwent chemo for breast cancer -- this is worse. My head is killing me, everything hurts all over, the fever left me sweating through my bedding, my chest is heavy like the time I had bacterial pneumonia for a month, and just walking from my bed to the kitchen for a drink leaves me faint.\n\nPlease, please be careful, you guys. I'm lucky in that my son is a teen who is eager to take care of me so I can stay in bed, but I know that's a privilege that some people don't have.\n\n- Take every possible precaution to limit exposure so that if you do come into contact, you have a low initial viral load and your body can begin fighting before it is overcome. \n- Prepare in whatever ways you can for if/when you do get sick -- have cold medicine, inhalers, whatever you like to eat and drink when you're feeling bad on hand.\n- If you live alone, make a group chat with friends or family so you can keep people in the loop easily if you begin showing symptoms.\n- Look into who you would need to contact for evaluation and/or diagnosis if you became ill.\n\nJust please, please take this seriously.

I wanted to share what I think of as my \"secret to success\" just in case it works on a single other person.\n\nThe goal is to focus compmetely on becoming my alter ego, Skinny Cool Girl. \n\nSCG is basically my imaginary role model, who is me from the future and is essentially me except she is super hot and climbs mountains and is friendly and adventurous and has lots of tattoos and dogs and is buddhist.\n\nI wasnt doing so well on the hot part. Body dysmorphia or not I'm still not sure, but damn it I want to be SCG!\n\nSo I decided to...start something *else* SCG does (besides look good). To start rock climbing. To get my first tattoo. To start hiking. To try a kickboxing class. To go out with friends. I just went \"skinny dipping,\" no pun intended. My next step is to go dancing for the first time. I'm planning a backpacking trip for next summer. I'm going to class so I can get the degree SCG has.\n\nSCG doesnt like everything she tries, but she tries anything. And she doesnt wait for other people to suggest things, she thinks of things she wants to do and seeks them out.\n\nBasically *I* dont want to do those things, but SCG does. And I want to be SCG. So I go, and I have had a great time and maybe I'm getting a little bit closer to being her.\n\nWhat I'm saying is: who will you be when you are YOUR Skinny Cool Girl? Will you go skydiving? Will you sing karaoke? Will you dress in bright bold clothes? Will you flirt with someone? Will you eat balanced meals, or apply for a better job? Will you perform or display your art? Will you go to bed on time?\n\nWhat leap will you take someday in order to become her? When will she do *insert activity here* for the first time?\n\nCan you make it happen now?\n\nTake one of the things future SCG has about her that you dont have, that isn't weight related, and go do it in the body you own and operate at this moment.\n\nThe brain, your soul, who you want to be does not change after you lose weight. Go be her. You have to *become* her still. Weight is only a small part of the equation. You'll catch up to SCG. Dont waste time while you think you're fat not being cool girl, or else you'll lose the weight and find out that SCG doesn't exist yet.",

At the time our risk/reward systems were so fucked up by cognitive developments and hormones that we may not have realised the dangers those people could pose. We've all found ourselves in terrible situations because of that I bet.  \nNow imagine that during that confusing time you were showing yourself off for thousands of people to see and to hear thousands of opinions about the way you look and dress. That must be so very mentally exhausting, and addicting in a way.  \nFor some of these young girls this behaviour is not coming from a centered place, so have compassion for them rather than resenting them for their desirability.  \nForgive yourself for thinking these thoughts. Just because you're an adult doesn't mean you will always find yourself doing what is good for you. A good start would be to stop engaging with this content and triggering yourself. You don't have to infantilize yourself to be attractive. You don't even owe being attractive to anyone. I know it's hard to want better for yourself; it;s why you use obsessions with food and aesthetic to cope anyway, but maybe take this small step and see where it takes you.  \nI promise you will feel better when you delete tiktok.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thanks for the silver!! <3  \nEdit 2: Thank you for the wholesome award?? <3  \nEdit 3: Thanks for the helpful and heartwarming award!!

We’re so messed up lol”\n\nThere are HARDLY real recovery posts here. It’s basically a place to get validation for your binges being okay or your restricting being *so* awful when the posts are lowkey flexes. \n\nThis sub poses as a place to get help for recovery and share thoughts with other people in recovery but it’s just....not really that. People post things like “I stay away from this sub when I’m not restricting so I don’t feel bad” why would you feel bad about recovering in a RECOVERY SUB??? Maybe because that’s not what it is?\n\nIt’s just a proed sub except anytime you say anything remotely proed you get fuckin swarmed and told you’re a shitty person by other people who probably agree with what you said.

    "selftext": "Quick Background: \n\n* I was in toxic relationship before I met my husband, and I wish someone had shaken me and told me that it was not normal and that it was not worth trying to build a lasting relationship with a guy who acted so casually cruel and didn't make an effort to care about my well-being.\n\n* I've been with my husband for ten years, and we've been married for six. \n\n* I've struggled with periods of binge eating and periods of extreme restriction for more than half of my life, now.  While I've been with my husband, my BMI's been underweight, normal, overweight, and even obese. He's seen it all--most more than once.  \n\nMy husband has never said anything negative about my appearance. Ever. Not even once. Not even when I've asked.  Not even when I intentionally make my curly hair super messy and wild to ask him what he thinks as a joke (he'll say he loves my crazy hair, or that it's \"cute\").  He has said the same positive things about how he finds me sexy when I've been at my fattest and when I've been at my skinniest.  If he has a secret preference, he will never, ever reveal it (believe me, at my lowest I have tried to trick him into admitting it).  After years of consistent compliments and no negativity, I actually trust that he doesn't care about my weight.  \n\nI never once had to tell him not to comment on my weight. He just wouldn't do that *because he's a good man*. \n\nWe've talked about my ED, and how he can intervene when he's worried about me without me feeling attacked or out of control.  He'd known about my issues, but when he wanted to learn ways he could help, he chose to bring it up at a relaxed time that was good for both of us, away from mealtimes--not in the middle of a fight about why I wouldn't eat soup or something.  \n\nNow, when he notices I'm restricting, he'll ask what he can make me that I will eat--and he'll bring it, no questions asked. So many lovingly-prepared salted tomatoes, you guys.  \n\nWhen he notices I've been binging, he'll start asking if we can do things that will give me an endorphin hit that aren't food-related (plan a trip, go for walks on the beach together, play with our pets, have sex, etc.). \n\nHe does not comment judgmentally on my eating.  No, \"Wow, that's a lot!\" or \"I made you all of this and you're only having ONE stuffed pepper??\" from him.  \n\n*One time* I was on antibiotics and had to eat three meals a day.  When I sat down for lunch on a day I'd also had breakfast, he commented, \"Oh, you're eating a lot today,\" and *immediately* corrected with, \"I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have said it like that. I meant that it's nice to see you eat three meals a day. I get to spend more time cooking and eating with you.\" That is literally the only time this man made any slightly critical comment about my eating in ten years, and I didn't have to explain to him why it might be triggering. \n\nWhen I see you guys posting about men who are, at best, careless, or, at worst, cruel, it breaks my heart. I've been there. I thought it was what I deserved, or that he was just being honest, or that I could finally figure out the magic way to explain to him why I was worth being kind to in a way that stuck.  I didn't know that it could be so much better.  You all deserve so much better.",

I felt overly gluttonous and therefore experienced absolute sickining guilt over how much I had eaten, because if someone with a significantly higher tdee than myself only needs 400-500 calories a day as postulated, then what the fuck was I doing eating over 1000? Why did I need so much food to sustain my smaller body, if a bigger body can do with so much less? I basically managed to gaslight myself into believing I have reverse body dysmorphia, because if she eats so little compared to me, how much do I *actually* weigh. It just sent me into a tailspin.

I had taken about 50 mg the day before, but I didn’t want my girlfriend to know about it, because I hadn’t had time to talk to her about it yet and I was embarrassed. BIG MISTAKE. \n    They gave me nitroglycerin, which is a vasodilator. Turns out viagra is a vasodilator as well. My pressure bottomed out, and I almost died. I could have ended my life that day, and I would have never seen anyone that I loved ever again because I told a fucking stupid lie. I swear it isn’t worth it to be embarrassed. Please, please always tell medical personnel about your medical history, and any drugs you take, because not doing so could cost you your life.

If anything, “glowing up” made him more insecure. I understood exactly what he meant. \n\nI grew up with cystic acne, chubby, awkward. I had no friends, nobody took me seriously, nobody saw me. Cue my junior year of high school, an eating disorder, platinum dyed hair and accutane and suddenly the world is full of generosity, kindness, respect and attention. I saw the stereotypical mold of beauty and shoved myself into it, no matter the cost on my physical and mental health, and it proved 100% of my fears about people treating me badly because I was “ugly”. \n\nMy friend and I both agreed that “glowing up” didn’t make us any more confident: in fact, it made us more paranoid and kinda justified our bad ED behavior. We know what it’s like to be “ugly”, and we know how much better life treats you when you’re thin and “pretty”.  We’ll do anything not to go back, and we’re constantly terrified that we somehow transformed back into what we once thought we were without realizing it. That we’re “fat” again. We know it happened once and know that it could happen again. \n\nBoth of us know that in reality our version of “fat” is probably closer to healthy, and don’t judge anyone else but ourselves based on these impossible standards. Can anyone else relate??\n\nEdit: typo, and thanks for the gold friend <3\n\nEdit 2: Wow, thank you all so much for sharing your stories and being so supportive. My friend and I have been reading through all the comments as they come, and we both agree that’s it’s been so awesome and validating to see how many of us went through similar situations.

    "title": "Kids shouldn't know what calories are. Period.",
    "selftext": "I love those Kids Try videos on YouTube.\n\nI was watching the Y2K one and one of the questions they asked the little girl (probably, like 6 or 7) was, about SunnyD, \"what do you think the difference between this and orange juice is?\" \n\nShe responded with, \"more sugar and more calories. My dad likes to stay away from things with too many calories.\" Or something close to that. Edit: to be clear, the question wasn't what bugged me; I was expecting her to say something like \"I don't think it's made from oranges.\"\n\nMy heart broke. PARENTS NEED TO STFU ABOUT THIS SHIT. YOUR BABY DOES NOT NEED TO BE ASSOCIATING CALORIES WITH WITH THINGS THAT NEED TO BE AVOIDED. FIRE SHOULD BE AVOIDED. POISON SHOULD BE AVOIDED. RUNNING INTO THE STREET SHOULD BE AVOIDED... CALORIES ARE LITERALLY ESSENTIAL FOR SURVIVAL AND YOUR CHILD SHOULD NOT BE INFLUENCED BY THE BELIEF THAT FEWER IS BETTER WHEN.THEY'RE.STILL.GROWING. I CAN'T EVEN RIGHT NOW.\n\nEdit: \n\nOhhhh boy. I was not expecting to return to this. \n\nInstead of rifling through the individual responses, I want to clarify a few things in general:\n\nI made a major mistake with the title of this post. I didn't even really think about it, honestly, and posted it when I was grumpy. It straight up says something that I didn't really mean, which is that kids should not know what calories are. As if it's that simple 🤦‍♀️\n\nWhat I actually meant was that young (like, before eight, give or take) don't benefit from placing numeric value on items of sustenance. Everyone is entitled to their opinions on this of course, but my opinion is that placing that value has harmful implications versus, say, explaining that a calorie is a unit of energy to fuel our bodies, which was mentioned and I am on board with. Furthermore, for a parent to impart onto a child that fewer calories = good is ridiculous; an apple may have more calories than a cracker, but we can all agree which has more nutritional value. Young children - again, YOUNG - don't necessarily have the context yet to deduce that on their own. \n\nI would never suggest hiding the fact that calories exist if a child was to ask about them. It's like a kid asking where babies come from, right? If your five year old asks you, you're probably going to give them age appropriate, honest answer, but you're probably not going to sit that five year old down to give them the birds and the bees chat unsolicited. Proper education is good, y'all!\n\nOf course this is a complex and controversial subject and I so, so appreciate all of you who have shared your opinions and experiences. There is no catch-all-correct way to handle something like this for every kid and all of us here have especially passionate opinions on this subject in particular. The best I can hope for is that future generations have better relationships with this thing that is required for survival (read: food) than I do. \n\nThe above is still not perfect clarification, but I hope it better explains what my intentions were in posting this.\n\nThis is a community of beautiful, thoughtful, fiercely intelligent individuals and I feel really fortunate to have all of you here.",

    "selftext": "\"To the bone\", starring Lilly Collins as Ellen, a twenty year old anorexic - if you've come across it, you'll probably know that it's highly popular amongst viewers suffering from eating disorders (particularly on ED Tumblr). \n\nIt's intended as a story of hope and recovery, with a brutally honest depiction of the impact an eating disorder has on somebody and the people around them. \n\nI'd argue that its appeal is so strong because it's an unrealistic interpretation of the lived experience of someone with an eating disorder - which shows a standard or ideal that lots of us might aspire towards in our most difficult times. \n\nEllen is tiny, she's also strikingly pretty, and she also has perfect control and apparently doesn't experience hunger at all. How is that realistic? I don't think I've met anyone yet who doesn't face a daily battle with cravings, internal conflicts, obsession with choosing what to eat, agonising over what they ate, bingeing, exercising intensely to get rid of it... the whole shebang. \n\nWhat do you guys think? It's been playing on my mind lately.\n\nUpdate: I'm blown away by your responses here guys, it's the very first time something I've posted to reddit has set up some good discussions, thanku sm 💚",

Even then, it’s not like my body structure’s ever gonna change, I’m always gonna have wide hips so I’ll never really look “classy” which is really frustrating. I feel like I’m always gonna hate myself. \n\nDoes anyone else aspire to look “classy” too? Also why do you think being slim is seen as “classier” than being thick?? I always thought it’s because they practice moderation or have really great self-control, but there’s the racism angle too because some non-white communities may have different standards like being thicker.\n\nEdit: Also if you’re curvy people would think of you as slutty no matter what you wear but I don’t wanna look that way I wanna be a fucking fairy or something\n\nI’m sorry for making it seem like I’m the only person who figured this out because I truly never had that assumption.

    "selftext": "Spicy title I know, and it’s not really keto but diet culture as a whole. I’m Asian, and my country’s cuisine is entirely based on rice. We eat rice every meal, we eat rice noodles when we dine out, we eat rice desserts, we eat various kinds of rice on our Lunar New Year. Rice has always been a symbol of warmth and health, a humble food that is beloved and cherished even in its plainest state - lots of people love eating a steaming bowl of plain white rice, maybe with a lil bit of soy sauce or fish sauce on top. \n\nAnd in 7th grade, I was taught that white rice is why I was fat and I gotta stop eating it. And now I’m terrified of rice, I’m constantly fantasize of the day I get skinny enough to eat rice. \n\nKeto is getting so popular in my country, and I’m so scared for little boys and girls hearing about the devil that is white rice. Hell, I’m scared for the women and men of all ages hearing bullshit about how it has fuck all nutritions and that’s why we gotta stop eating it altogether. Our diets are very balanced - 1 cup to 2 of rice per meal with soups/poached veggies, a meat dish, a stir fry/pan fried dish. Keto has no business here. \n\nAnd I’m targeting keto specifically bc it’s a bullshit diet that disguised as scientific or some shit. It’s taking advantage of this carb moral panic that will be out of fashion sooner or later, much like fat before. Debunking keto is getting more popular nowadays, but the craze is only getting started in my country. Watching my mother debating whether watermelon is unhealthy bc it has carbs is frustrating and heartbreaking. \n\nAlso I miss eating rice sm🥺",

    "title": "BED rant: no one talks about binge culture",
    "selftext": "TL;DR- Binge culture ruined my life and my health, and is ruining the lives of my entire community, but no one is talking about it\n\nBinge culture ruined my life. I was born and raised in Texas and I can’t speak for anywhere else but I know that here and in a lot of the USA southern states, bigger is better. That means bigger food portions, bigger clothing sizes, bigger seating, bigger drinks, everything is catered towards larger sizes. I hear about “diet culture” a lot but down here where I live it really doesn’t exist, maybe for certain communities, but for the most part people here revel in constantly binge eating foods that are extremely rich, sickeningly sweet, oily, cheese smothered, hot & spicy, and eating massive portions of them. It is very difficult to find foods that are low in calorie or even any type of specialty food for people with medical conditions or food allergies. Vegans are openly ridiculed and bullied for not eating meat, to the point where even products that are somewhat associated with veganism are openly derided by our STATE LEGISLATORS (see: Ted Cruz’s rant against tofu and soy products, which was extremely ironic considering Texas is one of the largest producers of soy in the entire USA). Gluten free products might take up half a shelf at the grocery store, while there are literally two full aisles just for sodas. When I started at my job, they didn’t have a uniform in my size, but they had plenty of L-3XL uniforms. I had to size up to a medium and it was the only medium they had left. Literally Everyone I know eats out at restaurants or takeout 3-4 times per week, sometimes every single day for lunch, and this is accepted as normal. People who bring their own lunches in to work are seen as weird, even if they can’t afford to eat out with their higher paid colleagues. My friends and coworkers are constantly complaining about their health effects caused by being overweight, but they don’t want to change how/what they eat and they laugh and joke about their previous heart attacks or diagnoses of diabetes as if it’s no big deal. Heart disease is the #1 killer in Texas even though it is highly preventable. The culture has been this way since I was a child.\n\nThis is the culture that gave me an eating disorder, not diet culture. A binge culture telling me that bigger is better, that eating 2 full sized portions meant to feed 2 people can and should be eaten just by me, in one sitting, and that that is “treating myself”. A capitalist culture telling me to buy and consume as much as possible, because that will make me happy. A culture blasting advertisements in my eyes and ears everywhere I look, telling me this new food product is what is going to make me happy, even if it’s just for a few minutes. A culture that has normalized eating 3 servings of ice cream in one sitting as a way to ‘help’ you when you are sad. A culture that has massive potlucks at church every Sunday and has normalized the sensation of eating 3 full plates or more until you are uncomfortably full, even to the point of damaging your stomach. This is binge culture. This is normal in my community, and it’s devastating it. \n\nBinge culture is just as insidious as diet culture, even more so in fact, because the binge culture is supported and subsidized by the massive corn industry(which is in EVERYTHING- corn syrup, corn starch, even things like citric acid, that’s from corn too!), the 528 billion dollar fast food industry, the \\~200 billion dollar soda industry, and the \\~105 billion dollar chocolate industry (which relies heavily on CHILD SLAVERY! See Nestles 2014 labor report in West Africa). Compare that to the \\~72 billion dollar diet industry (and that’s generous) and tell me which culture is more influential. Here in Texas the winner is clear. The only reason diet culture even exists in the first place is because of these highly influential and powerful food industries that have messed up the way that people are meant to intuitively eat, which is not possible in an artificial environment where people are constantly bombarded with food and images of food that are artificially engineered to be hyper palatable, visually pleasing, unsatiating, physically addicting, and constantly available wherever you go. THIS is why I developed BED. Not because of diet culture, but because binge culture is so accepted and normalized where I live that it is seen as the norm. I know this sub caters more towards restrictive eating disorders, but BED is just as valid of a disorder as AN, and us folks struggling with BED deserve to be heard. I struggle with extremely disordered binge eating, but I don’t feel like I can find support among some of these subs because they often facilitate the binge culture mindset and trigger me into bingeing. Sentiments like “restriction always leads to a binge” make my mind say “well you might as well just binge and not even try because any form of self control = restriction I guess”. Sentiments like “if you refuse any food offered to you at all that is restriction and that is a Disordered Mindset” being touted as ‘recovery progress’, when for me, the inability to refuse food is a hallmark of the BED mindset. This is not helpful to me and other BED sufferers and is actually enabling my form of eating disorder, which is ironic for a sub that claims to be for only pro-recovery. I just wish I could find the support of like minded people who have suffered the way I have because of the way we were raised.",

One of the men told the hotdog guy, they would buy my sausage. I thanked the men. I was raised that if someone wants to do something nice for you, you let them.\n\nI ended up getting the sausage with cold slaw and spicy mustard. It was really good.

He’s been underweight his whole life, and it’s because he’s just never been very interested in food. Plus he’s really lazy, so he wouldn’t go out of his way to buy or make food. Growing up, he ate his meals and didn’t care for ice-cream or sweets or soda, and as an adult, he eats full meals and doesn’t snack.\n\nI mean it’s not like I *just* discovered CICO. I’ve known it for years and knowing it fuelled my ED because I became addicted to how true and simple it was as a ‘rule’.

A caring, supportive environment is always the best to achieve full and sustainable recovery.\n\nHowever, I also do feel that...I don't know, us with EDs don't really like to be told certain things - we know those to be true, but we hate hearing them nonetheless.\n\nSo here's some ideas that I have that usually get me into heated arguments with other people in recovery:\n\n1. **it is a choice to engage in any kind of behaviour**. You can say all you want that \"I can't help but restricting\", \"I can't stop purging\", \"it's beyond my control\" etc., but the harsh reality is that you DO have a choice. You DO choose to engage in those behaviours. You CAN choose not to. You didn't choose to have an ED, but you do choose everyday to keep having one. There is no one, no one but yourself that forces you to keep restricting, purging, exercising or whichever other behaviour characterizes your ED.\nAnd so many people interpret this as \"it's your fault/you just have to do it\", whereas this is absolutely not the case. What I am actually trying to put across is that you DO have the control to change your actions. And this feels incredibly empowering. Knowing that, you also know what to do next - which doesn't mean you have to do it alone; you may very well have to ask for help. But it's still up to you.\n\n2. **your triggers are your problem**. Yes, society is shit. Yes, people are often assholes. Maybe they try to be nice, and they fail. Maybe they don't understand how you feel. Maybe no one does. But as an adult living in the real world you cannot expect anyone to accommodate your issues. You probably also say a lot of stupid stuff that might hurt someone else and you don't know anything about it. That's life. Recovery is also learning to be confident enough that you don't have to be bothered by any random comment you read or run back to your ED everytime you feel uncomfortable.\n\n3. **you have to quit all the excuses**. You can trick your therapist, your dietitian, your parents, your friends, strangers on the internet and everyone else into believing all you want them to believe. That you \"forgot\" to eat, or you \"just want to walk to manage anxiety\", or that you \"are doing everything you can\". But in the end, the only person that loses is you. Real life doesn't care about any shenanigans and if you're not fully honest with yourself and the others you will just be wasting time that no one will give you back, while the rest of the world goes on without really caring about you.\n\nThat's it, thank you for coming to my shitty ted talk.",

    "selftext": "I was dreading coming home for the holidays because I knew how blunt my parents would be regarding my weight. I’ve gained 20lbs in the past year. \n\nWhen I came home for break last winter I’d been at my lowest weight and was restricting below 500; my friends convinced me to tell my therapist, who sent me to a nutritionist on campus and pushed me to refeed. I let myself eat regularly over the summer, which I didn’t spend at home, and kept it up into this past semester. And now I’m relapsing hard and trying to lose weight again.\n\nThe first thing my dad said to me when I stepped into the house was, “You need to start losing weight. It’s unhealthy to be this fat.” (I’m in normal BMI range for my height by a long shot.) My mom comments at least once every few hours about how much fatter I look and how, “You don’t fit into your old pants, do you?” While eating dinner on my first day back, they ordered Papa John’s pizza & wings and said, “She eats so well, no wonder she’s gained so much weight.” We’d just spent the whole day moving into our new house.\n\nI spend my breaks working at my dad’s sushi restaurant, which is mostly staffed by older Korean adults. Every. Single. Damn. Day. Someone assumes they have the right to make some fucking comment about how much weight I’ve gained. Shit like, “I guess you just gain more and more weight each time we see you?” and “Look at her, she’s so chubby these days.” \n\nYesterday while at work, I had a complete mental breakdown in public. I was trying not to cry behind the host stand. My dad came over to ask what was wrong and I just fucking broke down in front of him. I told him how every single time anybody sees me they make comments about how fat I am and how much it fucking hurts. I promised him through my tears and rage that I’d stop eating for fucking good if that’s what everyone wanted from me. One of the sushi chefs, who’d commented just a few minutes prior, came over to apologize (I didn’t respond). I was wiping tears away while giving takeout orders to UberEats drivers and showing customers to their seats. It was fucking humiliating.\n\nThis is all just to say, Asian (particularly Korean) culture regarding weight is so. Fucking. Toxic. Everyone thinks they have the right to say something that could be hurtful to anybody to me just because “we’re friends” and they don’t give a fuck about mental illnesses. My family members have called me fat for as long as I can fucking remember, as I’ve always been a chubby kid. They compare me to my younger sister, who is 5 years younger than me, hasn’t fully gone through puberty yet, and was blessed with amazing genes. I’ve fucking had enough. I’ve never felt so motivated in my life to get as sick as I possibly can. When I hit my ugw and I’m withering away to nothing but bones and depression, they’ll eat their fucking words and regret everything.\n\nAnd they wonder why I have an eating disorder.\n\nedit: everyone here is so damn lovely and supportive. You didn’t have to gild this, but thank you so much and thank you to everyone who’s left a comment. It means so so much to me that there’s a community out there for me in which I can find comfort when my family and friends turn their backs on me.\n\nI hope everyone had a great holidays and is staying safe. 💓",

    "selftext": "when I hear eating disorder professionals  or people who are/ have recovered say things like “I just had to realize that gaining weight is OKAY. There’s nothing bad about it. And it’s okay and acceptable to gain weight”.  —- this really makes my blood boil. Because it implies that all people with eating disorders do not know that, which is a huge misconception. Folks with Ed are smart, some of the smartest people I’ve met, so this type of connotation is just so degrading. \n\nWhen we are recovering from anything weather it’s addiction to substance or Ed, deep down we KNOW the things that are true. We know that life without a drug or life with more weight on your body is “OKAY”..   I psychologically know that there is nothing “wrong” with gaining weight. I know when I gain weight, it’s okay, I know that I am still accepted by society and there’s nothing wrong with me. It’s not about the mentality or logistics of the ideology of weight gain. It’s the physical discomfort. \n\nthe Ed and mental illness isn’t that easy to just tell “oh it’s okay to gain weight! “ I DO NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE in my body when I gain weight. It literally physically feels uncomfortable. The weight on my physical body gives me anxiety. Movement in a body that is gaining weight gives me anger and panic episodes. The inflammation of weight gain gives me anxiety and anger and rage. When my legs are swollen and puffy or my fingers are too swollen to wear my rings, that doesn’t make me feel comfortable.  \n\nSo I wish people would understand when they are talking about weight gain and recovery, it’s not so black and white like that. It’s not just being OKAY with weight gain. I’m okay with weight gain, and I have gained quite a bit of weight in comparison to the days when I was anorexic. But to make it seem like it’s just an easy veil to lift, that it’s just resizing that “it’s okay” to gain weight, that is just not going to be helpful to a large % of folks w Ed.

And I can’t believe I didn’t notice it. Obsessively going on runs, skipping 2 meals a day and barely eating family dinner, and losing weight really fast to where he was skin and bones. Like, severely underweight. He also purged regularly, and listed off multiple methods to me so I know he’s dead serious. \n\nI knew he was skinny. I didn’t know it was intentional. I was too caught up in my own eating disorder to realize he had a problem. I didn’t know I wasn’t the only one passing out in school from not eating and having to be carried to the nurses office for saltines and a paper cup of orange juice.\n\nHe didn’t know about me either, though. Like me, he thought he was the only one. Little did he know I also had anorexia at the exact same time.\n\nWe’d compare weights. Talk about calories in the foods we were eating. We both had fitbits, and we’d go on runs at 11:30 pm to try to one-up the other on step counts. We both thought we were being slick and the other wouldn’t notice we had an ED. And I guess we were right, because neither of us noticed. We were so disordered we thought it was normal.\n\nI know my mom saw the paperwork when I was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa at 17. She’s caught me purging before. She intentionally fed me smaller portions of food to help me lose weight when I was already underweight. She noticed how skeletal my brother was (I mean, I’m talking almost bonespo thin, I was never nearly that bad. He had the advantage of a growing teenage boy metabolism) and expressed concern but did nothing. About a year ago she insisted nobody in our family has ever had an eating disorder.\n\nTwo out of three kids had anorexia and she did nothing. The third one of us has his own issues with gym obsession.\n\nI’m recovered now, and so is my brother, but the reality of how invisible we were is deeply saddening to me and I think it’s going to take me a bit to process this.",

    "selftext": "\ni started dating my boyfriend when i was 17 and pretty deep into my ED. i was never ridiculously skinny but definitely underweight - the kind that looks good to guys though i guess. but to maintain it i basically had to eat next to nothing. i’m now 21, he’s 24, and we’ve been going through a really rough patch because he’s addicted to porn lmao. long fucking story, definitely hasn’t done wonders for my self esteem, but i’ve felt until now like my self worth and confidence was only tied to him in healthy ways. \n\nsince recovering, i gained about >!20lbs!<. i was  >!100!< when we met, bmi >!18.3!<, and now my bmi is about >!22!< at 5’0. it’s definitely a significant change, i have some extra fat on my arms and stomach and face that i had to get used to, but i also filled out and became more “shapely” so it was an ok trade off imo. he was always supportive, i thought. \n\na couple nights ago we were having a really tough conversation. we’ve been on the edge of breaking up a few times recently due to his dishonesty and the way it’s affected our relationship. in the spirit of trying to be more “honest”, he told me that my weight gain has played a role in his porn addiction, because it took a lot of adjusting and he’s never been with someone “like that”. he even apparently talked to his therapist about it and how it made him feel like a bad person. i immediately started crying because that’s like, legitimately my worst fear. the fact that we’ve had sex hundreds of times since i gained weight and i always thought it was safe to assume he was attracted to me, and he wasn’t…… like just kill me atp lol. i have been literally making an effort in the past year to hide my tummy during sex less because i always thought he liked it, like i literally just look like a normal not-rail-thin adult woman and i thought that was fine. so fucking embarrassing my god. as soon as i started crying he started backtracking and saying it was more about how he could tell i lost confidence, which i didn’t- after recovery i was more confident. so that’s clearly bullshit. he fully knows i had an ed too, and i was already starting a diet to shed maybe >!5lbs!< when he said this. it was honestly so unnecessary and hurtful, but honesty ig.\n\nand now, my ed is back in full swing. i’ve lost >!9lbs!< in 5 days. all the normal food in my pantry has been replaced with low-cal 0 sugar lean options. which sucks because in recovery, i got really into cooking and making beautiful food of all kinds, but there’s no way that wouldn’t feel like bingeing to me now. i’m starting at >!1500!< cal a day, and once i stop losing weight i’m gonna do >!1200!<, etc. but i’m already restricting as low as i feel possible. literally had some lean granola and 0 sugar yogurt + a >!100cal!< granola bar yesterday. i felt dizzy all day and loved it. i’m weighing everything i eat and aiming way below my calorie goal. i feel like a flip has switched in my brain. it’s like all the things your ED brain tells you about recovery have come true, “people do think you look more beautiful when you’re sick, they’re just being nice to get you healthy, your body will never be healthy and beautiful that’s just not for you, everyone’s lying to you”\n\ni’m already getting re-addicted to all my old behaviours. it’s happening so fast and i’m completely committed to undoing all of my recovery. i can’t believe this is happening to me but i know it’s out of my control at this point. fuck my life man, i was doing so well, for so long",

Of course 10 minutes before the exam started I shit myself, no warning it just happened. I went to the toilet and tried to clean up as much as possible, which was'nt really doing anything so I took the 3 hour long exam in my shitty underwear and a short dress.

Why is it ok to diagnose a stranger on the internet with BED because they’re eating a lot to help their disorder?

I’m miserable and sluggish and slow and i can’t think. i can hardly breathe deep or walk without the floor ripping out from under me and i’m so cold i can’t even focus on anything but the mind numbing pain of the cold that’s ripping through the very core of my bones. I feel like my hearts not even in my chest and I can’t focus on school work or clubs and i DEFINITELY can’t do a sport so i’m just completely uninvolved in any kind of extracurricular, job, and i’m failing school at the ripe age of 16. My hair is ripping out of my head and my teeth are visible through my skull. My skin is a mottled gray. I am hideous. \n\nOf course, to make my life a little more miserable and slightly more unbearable, I have to start having mini seizures probably endured from malnutrition or something akin, coupled with other various stages of what i’d guess to be organ failure, so now I get the joy of being barley able to do anything at all. No driving, no job, no hobbies, no real friends, no family that cares, all i do is starve and starve and exercise day and night. I just walk around my town in endless circles to burn off the little crap I eat. My dog is afraid of me because I look so monstrous, people in public look at me with either pity or disgust. All my friends have dates to homecoming already and beautiful dresses and I am unable to even think of going and making memories. \n\nIt’s not worth it. I should’ve never fallen into this hole. I’m going to die sad and misera and alone at just 16 years old. I just don’t understand why me? I don’t understand what I did to deserve this. I don’t understand why my parents don’t care or love me enough to get me help. I don’t understand why I don’t want it. \n\nI know this reads dramatic, but if you have the chance please try to at least do harm reduction. Or else you’ll die. Literally die. And not a romantic poetic suicide, a slow drawn out torturous death as you watch in horror and a frantic, beating frenzy as you skip and slip down that deep dark hole knowing this isn’t what you really want, but you can’t stop.\n\nThe only thing I have going for me right now is that iM sKiNnY but that doesn’t even matter because i’m so miserable i can’t even enjoy the body i’ve killed my self over and over and over again for. \n\nIt was worthless. a meaningless existence defined by the simple fact of being thin. \n\nThat knowledge is more painful than any other symptom.",

    "selftext": "Exactly what the title says. This post is targeted towards people in the same circumstances as myself. Obv everyone’s height/weight/goals are different.\n\nThe “1200 is plenty” mentality is driving so many towards eating disordered behavior and I can’t believe so many people advocate for this diet without medical recommendations or approval from a physician. The “1200 is plenty” movement has given my brain an unrealistic expectation for what weight loss is supposed to be and an unrealistic goal to achieve.\n\nHere’s the math I did:\n\nI’m 5’3” and 125lbs. My BMR is 1256 calories a day and my TDEE with light exercise is 1727 calories per day. Science says that if I eat at a 500 calorie deficit per day, I’ll lose a pound per week. That’s 1227 calories a day (which is slightly more than 1200 btw if you’re keeping track of the math).\n\nExcept last night, I started thinking about the numbers. Why do I need to lose a pound per week? I weigh 125lbs and a pound per week is 0.8% of my body weight. I am asking my body to lose almost 1/100ths of myself every week when I’m not even overweight. I do want to lose body fat and tone up, but it’s not like I’m doing it for health reasons at this point. \n\nIn comparison, if I weighed 250lbs (TDEE of 2507 cals/day) then losing a pound per week would be 0.4% of my body weight, half of what I would be asking for at 125lbs.\n\nSo why does our society push this 1200 calories/day diet to us? Why am I asking my normal weight body to work twice as hard to lose this weight as someone who is obese for my height? If I scaled back my efforts to match the 0.4%, then that’s half a pound of weight loss per week, NOT a full pound. \n\nThe numbers are worse when you consider how much of a calorie reduction it is per day. At 250lbs, a 500 calorie reduction means eating 80.1% of your normal calories per day. At 125lbs, a 500 calorie reduction means eating 71% of your normal calories per day.\n\nI’m not sure when/where our society decided that 1200/day was the goal, but it’s not sustainable and we are restricting 10% MORE calories than individuals twice our weight when there isn’t even a medical reason to do so.\n\nTL;DR: 1200 calories a day is a bullshit concept and if you’re at a height/weight where losing a pound/week means eating at 1200 cals/day, then you probably shouldn’t be trying to lose a pound/week because it is asking your body to work twice as hard. We work 2x as hard and put in all that effort and then wonder why we stress and burn out and end up eating disordered.",

Like come on, there’s no way you could live through the experience of being anorexic and not know exactly what you’re doing. I’ve seen this a few times on tik tok, a platform where videos randomly flash across your FYP based on the algorithm (so you don’t seek them out most of the time) and it’s especially funny that they’ll put “TW ED” on the first slide which is a picture of their emaciated bodies. They aren’t just candid photos either, they’re half ass (if not fully) naked, pulling their skin over their ribs, titling their pelvis to emphasize the thigh gap, sucking in ect. Just very obvious thinspo poses.\n\n“I’m spreading awareness!”\n\nSpreading awareness that, yes, you were sick and you achieved that low weight. Low weight anorexics have the most awareness of anyone in the ED community. \n\n“I want to show others who are suffering how bad it can get!”\n\nSomeone else suffering with a restrictive ED will think one of two things upon seeing these photos. 1. I don’t look anything like that so I don’t need to recover 2. I want to look like that and you’ve shown it’s possible to do and survive, so I don’t want to recover.\n\n“I’m not responsible for your triggers!”\n\nI can understand this if it was something unreasonable like, some people are triggered by the color blue and you can’t expect someone to accommodate that, but it costs zero dollars to not post underweight body check photos, and when the discourse around it is that it’s generally harmful, why continue to do it to a community you supposedly want to recover?

    "selftext": "I’m going to lose my everloving mind if I see one more tiktok or Instagram post about restrictive/purge eating disorders being caused by diet culture/beauty standards/fatphobia, and I will lose it even worse if the post goes on to suggest that if we get rid of diet culture/beauty standards/fatphobia, there wouldn’t be any more EDs. And if the post suggests that people who have EDs are inherently fatphobic… I just might spontaneously combust. \n\nIn my mind, takes like “you have an ED? So you’re fatphobic?” are just as ignorant, lacking in nuance, lacking in empathy, and honestly lacking in common sense as “you have depression? So you just cry all day?” Or “you have schizophrenia? So you have voices that tell you to kill people?” \n\n*some* people with depression cry all day, *some* people with schizophrenia hear violent voices, and *some* people with EDs are fatphobic. Not all, not even most, not even a large percentage. \n\nIf restrictive/purge EDs were caused by diet culture or beauty standards or fatphobia, why do we have records of these disorders dating back from the 1500s and earlier, when diet culture didn’t exist and the beauty standard was larger bodies as a symbol of wealth?\n\nIn today’s culture, the beauty standard is “thicc”. Why is it then that people aren’t trying to restrict/purge themselves into an hourglass shape? Why is the goal underweight?\n\nWhy do men have restrictive/purge EDs when the beauty standard has *never* been tiny and skinny for them? When diet culture that targets men is focused on getting shredded and huge?\n\nThere are *so many* reasons someone might develop a restrictive/purge ED. \n\nEDs can come from a need to feel in control, as a method of SH, because someone tried to recover from their BED and fell into restriction instead, from an addiction to watching the numbers on the scale go down, an addiction to hunger highs, a need to feel “accomplished”, OCD (“the food is contaminated I need to avoid it/purge it”), as a way to physically manifest internal pain, feeling like if you’re sickly and fragile people will love you more, a desire to make yourself *unattractive* after being SA’d, as a way to alleviate dysphoria (losing your period, etc), a desire to go back to childhood when you were small and cared for, a way of having something to focus on other than your pain, a desire to shrink yourself so much you totally disappear (usually after trauma or abuse), as a long term method of suicide, an addiction to the feelings of power caused by “successfully” restricting/purging, etc, because that’s how your parents were and you didn’t realize it wasn’t normal, because you wanted the sense of community found in ED circles, etc. I could go on and on.\n\nNone of those reasonings have anything to do with or would be solved by ending fatphobia or diet culture or beauty standards. \n\n“But there are people with EDs who developed them to be pretty, or because they’re fatphobic!” Sure. But here’s the thing: the vast majority of people don’t feel attractive enough at some point in their life. There are (unfortunately) many fatphobic people in the world. *And yet the overwhelming majority of these people don’t develop debilitating, lethal disorders because of it.* A mentally healthy person does not deal with those feelings by restricting or purging. Getting rid of fatphobia or beauty standards is not going to fix what the people who developed EDs for that reason were struggling with before their ED. \n\nSo please, tiktok “activists” and instagram “coaches”, for the love of god, *stop saying that shit*\n\nETA: Okay I want to clarify because I think my frustration fueled rant wasn’t particularly articulate in some ways- my point was not “beauty standards never have an impact on anyone’s ED ever”, it was “there are hundreds of things that can cause or significantly contribute to an ED that have nothing to do with beauty standards or diet culture despite the outside perception of EDs being ‘EDs are 100% caused by not feeling attractive enough/thinking being fat is ugly’. This leaves many people with inadequate resources for recovery, when so much of it is focused on loving your body with little attention to other factors. It also doesn’t take into account that even for people whose main reason is to fit beauty standards, mentally healthy people don’t respond to not fitting beauty standards by starving themselves or purging. 99.99% of the time there are underlying factors or mental health issues involved too that wouldn’t be cured by stopping beauty standards, and those are important to address in recovery as well.”",

I cannot stress enough that gaining weight with an under 1000cal intake is pretty much impossible. It cannot be done. This is not how bodies work. Your brain needs a shitton if cals even if you have brain fog. Your heart beats and your intestines work, your core will be kept warm for as long as possible. No matter how thin or short you are, you will need more than a few hundred calories just for being alive.\n\nTell yourself that when you think you gain on water and half a salad per day.\n\nThen why is the scale telling you otherwise?\n\nBecause scales are not great for measuring small fluctuations. Scales can't tell you if you lost a fraction of a pound or gained. If you weight yourself 3 times you will get three weights.\n\nWater in your body exists.\n\nFood in your intestine exists.\n\nThat all is part of your weight.\n\nSo instead of enjoying those sweet moments of beating up yourself over destroying your metabolism and painting doom scenarios in your head how you can only eat 100cals per day to lose weight - focus on how that is a lie your ED is telling you to make you restrict more and hate yourself more.",

Then I remembered that he had a plate of hashbrowns in the morning, a latte, and some fruit on his lunch break. \n\nPeople will snack on food/have small meals in between breakfast/lunch or lunch/dinner, and they won't count it as actually \"eating\" that day because it's not a normal meal. \n\nAnd MOST PEOPLE DO NOT COUNT DRINKS AS MEALS. \n\nMost of the time \"I haven't eaten anything today\" means \"I haven't sat down at the table and prepared myself a dish\". And more importantly, YOU'RE ALLOWED TO EAT EVEN THOUGH SOMEONE ELSE HASN'T EATEN IN FRONT OF YOU.\n\nThis is a reminder to you. Because I always get SO INSECURE and nervous when people tell me that they haven't eaten that day, because for some reason my brain doesn't realize that I get to have food just \"because\".

If only you knew that, right after I left the shop, I would take these donuts to my strategically parked car and eat almost every single one of these, by myself and in a single sitting, until I was writhing in severe pain so bad that I wouldn’t even be able to drive away until my body actually got some time to digest some of the food. If only you knew, that no, I wasn’t just hungry; I was fucking famished to drown my agony in donuts, even despite the fact that I did the same thing last night as well.\n\nIf you knew, you probably wouldn’t be laughing at your own joke anymore. You would probably be mortified at your own words, disgusted at the behavior, and sympathetic toward me.\n\nIf only you knew..\n\nBut that’s okay. You didn’t know. That’s why I laughed are your comment too. That’s why, in my eyes, you’re sweet. You probably thought I was taking these donuts to my friends or family, talking and laughing in between bites of these pockets of saccharine goodness. You probably thought there was no way a 5’2 girl would ever possibly eat all of these on her own; maybe if I were 300 lbs, you wouldn’t have said such a comment. But that’s okay, because from the outside, it doesn’t look like I’m suffering from an eating disorder, so there’s no way you could possibly know.\n\nTo the sweet, old man at the donut shop, I hope you enjoy that single donut that you purchased yourself and remember me as the girl who laughed at your joke and bought donuts to share with others. I wouldn’t want to burden your day with my issues; I want you to remain comfortable enough to continue joking with strangers. I don’t want you to know.\n___\n\nEDIT: I can’t believe I got so many compliments on my writing. I literally whipped this up randomly and quickly as I was waiting for my food to digest a little before I could drive away from the parking lot after that binge, and I wasn’t expecting this kind of response at all. I can get a bit insecure about my writing, and these comments honestly made me absolutely delighted. Like, maybe I’m not such a worthless loser lol..Now...if only I could believe people in the same manner when they actually call me pretty or not fat lmao",

A while ago I joined a pretty active pro-ana community in which you can chat about struggles, give advice and share \"accomplishments\". What I've realized later is that there's also a place to share body checks. This is where I was surprised. Most body checked were from people who are overweight. Not only that, they were posted by the same people who've been giving me heart wrenching advice on how to lose an extreme amount of weight and eat the smallest amount of food.\n\nThis made me realize (even more) how unrecognized and unvalidated overweight people with anorexia must feel. I feel terrible knowing that people who want to get healthier by losing weight engage in dangerous activities and go to the other extreme. I feel terrible that I was so wrong about the majority of anorexics and I feel so bad that they are not only not believed by most non-anorexics when they say they are anorexic.

It’s still water weight! When you metabolize food one of the chemical byproducts of the oxidation is water. So for every gram of food, there is a certain amount of water that comes in its breakdown. It’s not actual weight, and you should NEVER limit your water intake when you binge to keep the water weight down. I promise it’s not real weight, and the key is to stay hydrated.",

That all took a toll on my weight and my mental health, so I’m bigger than I’ve ever been in my life. \nShe knows I’ve struggled with an ED since I was 13, but now that I weigh more she makes a point to remind me. She tried on my skirt yesterday and said something like, “wow, I remember when you were so tiny, now your clothes are too big for me” \nAnd just today, after I told her I was uncomfortable going to pools or the lake bc of my body, she sent me pictures of herself in a bathing suit saying “you just need to work out and eat right like me” \nSorry if I’m rambling or if this sounds stupid, but... I’ve never seen her happier than she has been since I gained weight. \nI really don’t think that’s the right way to treat your daughter.

    "title": "Want to start purging?",
    "selftext": "This post is for you, regardless of your bmi, current ED, your walk of life... purging WILL fuck you over.\n\nA purge is a bandaid solution. You know that. You might be interested in doing it to:\n\n- start fresh\n\n- after a bad binge \n\n- maybe you were forced to eat out with friends/family and you ate what you didn’t want to\n\n- you want to be the Cool Girl/Guy who looks like they eat whatever and “stay”/“get” skinny\n\n- maybe you do it for self harm purposes \n\nAs someone moving from BED to Bulimia, here’s what I’ve concluded.\n\n**APPEARANCE**\n\nI’m not saying y’all are like me, but I can be vain as fuck and put my appearance first. Here’s what you get with purging. \n\n- Weight change. I know this is obviously the big thing. Obviously the scale goes down compared to before a purge. But you’re losing a lot of water, stomach acid etc. which gives you this false sense that you’re losing weight. In reality, most bulimics will maintain or (more likely) gain weight longterm even though you’re “”””correcting”””” your purge. Most bulimics are in the normal-overweight BMI and not formally diagnosed.\n\n- Teeth are fucked, thin, sensitive,  yellow and breath smells bad 24/7\n\n- The skin around your mouth will be ravaged. It’ll be raw and you’ll break out in pimples and weird texture from the stomach acid, snot, tears, vom, bile that comes up\n\n- Swollen glands make your cheeks v chipmunky... my face looks like an amorphous pancake compared to my body and BMI. Nothing will help accelerate your face getting back to normal. Not diuretics, changing water intake, electrolytes. It goes a little with each day you don’t purge.\n\n- Bloodshot eyes, petechiae, burst capillaries around your facs. Nothing really helps it go away faster it just takes days.\n\n- Your hands will get scarred and tears and bleeding. \n\n- Heartburn and stomach pains 24/7. Gut flora is fucked to high heavens. Burps and farts (so much GAS goddamn) and lots of bloating. Surprise involuntary regurg is a bitch.\n\n- Nothing cuter than purging out of your nose or pissing your pants because of the strain of purging 🙃. Splashback is also a very real thing... and so is the toilet blocking up biG time\n\n- Your throat is raw and painful, increased episodes of tonsilitis. \n\n**FEELINGS and FUNCTIONING**\n\n- I hear people purge because the purge itself gives them a high. Let me warn you, you may lose the purge high. I don’t feel calm or good or pure like I used to after purging, everytime I near the end of a dissociative binge I absolutely hate and fear the purging after.\n\n- Some, like me, purge to gain back the loss of control that occurs with a binge or the guilt after eating anything at all. There is NOTHING that makes you feel as helpless and out of control than getting stuck in a b/p cycle. \n\n- After you purge food, your body is prepped and rearing to break down food, so with the food gone, your hunger level comes back to before or worse. I always thought I would have “better control” than to get stuck in a b/p cycle, but I swear it’s a slippery slope that inevitably happens.\n\n- my gag reflex has been desensitised so my methods of purging become more and more aggressive. I’m sure if i had a dental check up, I’d have bruises down my throat\n\n- You’ll lose electrolytes purging which means more fainting, lightheadedness, poorer concentration in work/study\n\n- Purging comes with increased risks of losing consciousness (and if you pass out at the toilet bowl, you could at least chip a tooth, at worse cause life-threatening damage) and choking whilst purging which is damn terrifying. \n\n**SOCIAL LIFE and FINANCES**\n\nDon’t be blindsided by thinking purging will let you have a better social life- afterall most social activities involve food, right?\n\n- The fear of choking during the following purge will get you choosing foods you don’t even like, so that it comes back up easier.\n\n- you will be the odd one who always runs to the bathroom afterwards or has to leave asap to purge. If you can’t purge in time, the anxiety floods in and you (read: me) may get a bit mental\n\n- you will at some point have your purging session interrupted by someone. Whether it’s by a stranger in a restaurant bathroom, a friend, a family member... that shit is mortifying and isolating.\n\n- You will get more and more desperate with where you purge. Maybe it starts out in the “safety” of your home... one thing leads to another and you’re ready to purge at the vilest, Jackson-Pollock-y gas station toilet. Gross and unhygienic but you can’t help yourself.\n\n- B/P cycles (read later in this post) are fucking EXPENSIVE. You are buying food that will not stay long enough to give you macronutrients or micronutrients. You are literally flushing money down the toilet. One thing that keeps me up at night, is the disgust I feel knowing I wasted so much food, resources, time, energy and money because of this disorder. \n\n———————\n\nThis is an elaboration on my response to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/afmp84/comment/ee0k53c), thanks u/HoldenCaulfield7 for encouraging me to make this a separate post. \n\nAt the end of the day, I can only share my warnings and experiences with y’all. \n\nThe temporary “good” is nothing compared to the harms it’s given me, and I still feel shackled to this disorder daily. Please be careful y’all and rethink starting purging 💛\n\n———————\n\nEdit: I’m reading all your comments btw. I have so much love for all of you sharing your stories no matter what stage you are with purging. Love this community, stay strong. Thanks for the gold and silver too darls ✨",

Maybe my mum won't tell me to never wear short sleeves again even though that was my favourite t-shirt and it made me feel pretty. Now I'm 21 years old. I made yoghurt and granola for breakfast but I can't eat it: my stomach is upset and it's churning and it hurts and I can't put anything into it. His words crawled their way down my throat, they churned in my stomach, they've made me full and once again I convince myself that I'm not hungry. That I don't deserve to eat. Pretty girls don't eat. They become angels and float. They become light enough to sit on the shoulders of men bigger and taller than them with heads so high they look like skyscrapers from their child-like eyes filled with wonder. They claim their throne of strong dad shoulders and are told that they're pretty, and worth it, and are deserving of love. But I'm not an angel, and was always told that I never would be. And it hurts. Even if I skip breakfast and faint for lunch I won't be an angel.\n\nEdit: After this incident I was heartbroken and in tears. I felt empty and alone. But while I am still crying, it's for a completely different reason now: you're all so lovely. Thank you for making me feel listened to. It's somehow both beautiful and heartbreaking to know that I don't suffer alone. Again, thank you all.",

    "selftext": "I don’t know if this is the competitive part of my ed speaking or if i’m actually right, i’m interested to see what other people think. So many of my friends have done fad diets or tried eating in a calorie deficit/ counting calories, or had a “gym phase”. In most cases for these people they did these things for no more than 2 months. one of my friends was having lots of health issues and couldn’t eat much because of it, she was talking about that time with me and referred to it as her eating disorder. When i was in treatment one of the dieticians was talking about unhealthy eating/ exercise habits but she was making such blanket statements like “if you count calories you have an eating disorder”. I found it extremely triggering because I knew so many people that had success with counting calories that allowed them to get to a healthy weight or overall improve their quality of life. When she said that anyone that does that has an eating disorder it made me think that there were so many people that I now had competition with. It sounds bad I know, but every time I hear someone has an ED i find myself comparing me to them. When people talk about their failed diet that they tried for a month then continued living their life normally as their “eating disorder” it seems to undermine the reality of most ed’s. It’s hard to explain this without sounding like a judge for the anorexia olympics lol, can anyone kind of understand where I’m coming from though?",

A lot of ED treatment is super paternalistic, sexist, and controlling due to the fact that the majority of patients in treatment are young girls\n4. More focus should be on preventing substance abuse and unwanted pregnancy... because the ED population have these on much higher rates than the typical population\n5. \"Set point weight\" is really just the weight that aligns with a person's hunger cues... which makes sense, because genetics / lifestyle influences appetite\n6. The ED medical field is overrun with people with active EDs\n7. A lot of ED doctors are actively contemptuous of their ED patients\n8.

    "selftext": "(The one with Hillary Duff, for clarification)\n\nPartly ED related, which is why I’m venting here. TL;DR at the end. \n\nWatching this movie now I’m much older and have struggled with an ED for a while has really changed my feelings about everything in the movie. \n\n\nED related reasons: \n\n1) The bullies/popular girls have eating disorders, and this is treated as one of their evil traits. Are they horrible people? Yes, for sure, but mental illness is not one of the reasons why. \n\n2) “If given a choice, would you eat a rice cake or a Big Mac?” (love interest asks our protagonist, Sam, this question while trying to get to know her better)\n\nThis question bugged me so much. Because on top of making EDs an evil trait, Sam is put on  such a high pedestal for not dieting and eating whatever she wants. That’s great, but your diet does not make you superior to others. I hate how much this movie implies “people who diet = bad”. Are diets evil? They can be, but it’s not like following a diet makes someone the Wicked Witch of the West.   \n\nAlso, I’d like to add that the main love interest (forgot his name) was dating one of the mean girls and somehow did not notice that her or her friends had actual issues. In fact, it’s a joke amongst the whole group (there is a joke about laxative abuse). It’s as if eating disorders are a trendy diet. They are teenagers, so maybe they didn’t notice, but by senior year of high school, I’m sure most people would understand that these types of habits are not healthy or normal. \n\nNon ED related reasons:\n\n3) Vanity == Evil is a very very prominent theme throughout the movie. The evil stepmom is constantly getting plastic surgery. The popular girls are all on “diets” and dress fashionable, while our protagonist dresses plainly. In reality, wanting to look nice isn’t a negative trait. Waking up and wanting to look and feel your best isn’t a sin. Sam isn’t better or worse for her fashion sense (or lack thereof, supposedly), she just wakes up and feels her best differently than how the other girls do. And this doesn’t make any of them better or worse. Unless you’re in this movie of course. \n\n4) Kinda adding onto the above, but Sam is still conventionally attractive. I’m sure the movie would be very different if she wasn’t. \n\n5) There are some strong “beauty OR brains” vibes coming from this movie. You shouldn’t be teaching young girls (or anyone) that you have to pick between the two. Putting on lipstick won’t lower your IQ. Reading a book won’t make you ugly. You can be both. You can care about your appearance and be intelligent. They are not mutually exclusive. \n\n\nTL;DR: This movie portrays eating disorders as a negative personality trait/trendy diet and gives off very very very strong notliketheothergirls vibes. Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk. Now go wash your hands. \n\nI’m pretty sure none of this made any sense bc it’s late and being in isolation has turned my brain to mush but thanks for reading.",

    "selftext": "Last year while searching Reddit for low-calorie recipes, I stumbled upon an ED-related subreddit (which I now moderate) that shed a lot of light on a situation I didn't even realize I had spiraled into. As a guy in my early forties, eating disorders were about the furthest thing from my mind.\n\nIt began in early 2018. I was sitting on the couch on a Saturday morning with a Jack and Coke in my hand. I was close to 100 lbs overweight and feeling disgusted with myself. I got off the couch and went for a 2 mile walk - probably my first real exercise in years. I walked again the next day and every day after that for the next 3 months. I also downloaded MFP and added CICO to the mix. I set a goal to lose 40 lbs, which I met within 3 months. Around that time, I gradually began running, hoping to continue losing weight, and did I ever lose the weight. In the coming year, I lost another 70 lbs and worked my way up to running half marathons. CICO and counting calories became a way of life. I gradually got serious about running and with that, started obsessing over macros. I told myself and others it was to be the best runner I could be, but the real reason was a deathly fear of gaining weight.\n\nEating became increasingly complicated. At times I would stand in the kitchen for an hour or more, stressing over the specifics of my next meal or even a simple snack. Knowing my wife would get annoyed by me asking her about dinner plans hours in advance, I would restrict my calories earlier in the day in case a surprise got sprung on me later in the day. Sometimes I would regret putting food in my mouth and spit it out. One day last summer while showering after a long training run for an upcoming marathon, I was overcome with lightheadedness and entered a brief state of delirium. I ran out of the bathroom, soaking wet, with the shower still running, and started panicking and saying nonsensical things. Fortunately my wife was home to give me food and something to drink. I was severely dehydrated and most likely depleted of electrolytes. I had burned more than 5x the calories I consumed before and during the run. I did a little better in the marathon but even still, experienced difficulties in the later miles that were likely attributable to calorie restricting.\n\nAll I ever wanted was to be healthy and this remains my goal. I am ever so gradually working on these issues, becoming more decisive in my food decisions and ever so gradually testing the waters of food that had become \"unsafe\" for me. I'm not really sure why I'm here or what I hope to accomplish. I guess I just wanted to put my story out into the universe. Maybe it will be cathartic. My best to you all.",

I couldn’t stand myself. Eventually I tried to smile for him and asked him to get himself some breakfast, I wanted to make sure he was getting enough food even if I couldn’t face going into the kitchen with him. He told me I should eat something too. Whenever I said no, he quietly said “oh-kay” in a kind of voice that made him hold me a little tighter and made me feel a little more guilt nuzzle into my belly. He took a long time before he came back upstairs, his head bowing to reach the door handle while he hugged two glasses of water and a bowl. He brought me the water with a kiss, and inside the bowl was a cut up green apple, slightly warm from the pantry and sweetly drying on my tongue. He must have known I would still feel safe, unweighed down eating a piece of fruit that light, that he could give me that instead of seeing me refuse everything. I wanted to convey to him how much that cut up apple meant to me. To me it was the purest act of love, a gesture that made me shiver with nostalgia for the times when my mom rapped on the door with a bowl of cut up fruit for me, no particular reason, just the fruit bearing the memory of her hands peeling rinds and slicing away stems and seeds, all of it for me. I couldn’t figure out a way to convey this heavy gratitude, this strange and personal meaning, but I clutched his thigh and whispered thank you. We silently shared the cut up apple, the bowl sitting between us on the bedsheets, our hands equally alternating for the fruit, and I quietly noticed, first thinking it was accidental, eventually realizing it was purposeful, that each time his fingers met the bowl, his hands nudged the sweeter slices away towards me and would take only the bruised ones.",

And my mom always said it's Latin and it means \"beautiful.\" For almost all my life I believed this. Until I recently became friends with a Latin major. We had a conversation about random stuff and our names came up. I told her my name was short for Macilenta and that it stands for beautiful. Then she freaking shook her head at me and said that it's not beautiful. Macilenta is a modification of the word macilentus, which translates to SKINNY! My name means skinny.\n\nI fucking hate her for doing this to me. Not the word itself, but she fucking signed her toxic identity into my name. If a mother literally calls her child skinny, the child is fucking doomed the second it is born. Good to know that it was not some event that caused my ED. It's started the moment I was shat out in the hospital.",

Wait AT LEAST a half hour, but preferably more, because the motion will erode the enamel that's been softened by recent exposure to acid. Instead... \n\n- Swish your mouth with plain water as many times as you can stand, then suck on a mint or chew some gum. Salivary flow will help get protect your teeth from any remaining acid. \n\n- Buy a sensitivity toothpaste. Even if they aren't sensitive yet, someday I promise they will be if you don't protect your enamel with the right products. These are designed to protect your enamel better than others, and from my experience, they actually work. \n\n- Use a children's mouthwash. These have a much higher fluoride content (which is often entirely absent in regular mouthwashes). Fluoride is vital in protecting enamel from acid erosion. Since I started using it my teeth are wayyyy less translucent. \n\n- If you're comfortable doing so, tell your dentist. They can prescribe medical-grade products and insurance will most likely cover it. \n\n- Avoid binging on highly acidic things and/or very sugary things (though I know those are often the most tempting). The prolonged exposure (as binges generally last a while) can cause problems all by itself. \n\n- From a darling commenter- chew tums when you're done! It'll neutralize the acid. That's it's job! \n\nThat's all I've got for now but if I remember anything else I'll come back and add it. \n\nTake care of yourself, dear. You (and your teeth 😉) matter. ",

    "selftext": "I just don't get it. In addition to my eating disorder, I have been diagnosed with Bipolar Type 1, PTSD, anxiety, and struggle with addiction/alcoholism. Out of all those diagnoses, the only one that people literally don't even bother to try to understand is the anorexia. Most people are extremely empathetic about the PTSD and anxiety, and while bipolar is misunderstood sometimes, people don't make as many ignorant comments about it as they do my ED. And when I explain the brain chemistry behind the mental illness, they get it. \n\nBut I've got good friends of mine who I have told time after time about my struggles with ED over this relapse the last 4 months and they continually just don't get it. At all. Why is that? Why is it so difficult for people to empathize with EDs? My friends who don't have alcoholism somehow still manage not to say triggering stuff about that and can respect my boundaries, and they get that being an addict isn't a choice, but something I have to manage regardless. My friends who don't have anxiety are still capable of comforting me during a panic attack. My friends who don't have PTSD understand why seeing a man who assaulted me in public can cause me to spiral. My friends without bipolar may have never experienced mania or suicidal depression, but they believe me when I say I am miserable and in pain. Yet, when I confide in people about my ED, it's always the same sorts of things, over and over. \n\n\"Well you don't look bad, you still look healthy\"\n\n\"I mean, 800 calories a day isn't that little, just try eating a bit more between meals\"\n\n\"Purging is nasty\"\n\n\"oh yeah, I didn't eat like anything today either, I just wasn't hungry\"\n\nRANT INCOMING\n\n1. People do not understand the serious medical implications of struggling with an eating disorder, particularly when it comes to long term restriction and purging. You do not have to be 70 lbs to die of an eating disorder. \n2. Why do people need physical \"evidence\" of an eating disorder being bad before they give a shit? No one needed evidence when I relapsed into drinking, My grades were still perfect and I drank alone so people didn't see, but when I told people I was miserably drinking myself into a hole every night, they believed me. No one said some ignorant shit like \"well you're not drunk right now so clearly there's no problem.\" Or when I say I'm depressed and considering suicide, no one says \"well you don't cry 24/7 so you're fine.\" Why are the physical indicators so necessary for eating disorders to matter?\n\nGuys, I'm honestly so upset. Every person I tell about my eating disorder either gives the stupidest advice (try a protein shake, etc) or tries to force feed me or  compares their experience to that time they lost their appetite due to the flu or says I'm being stupid by starving myself. These are good friends of mine who are super understanding and kind and empathetic when it comes to my other mental illnesses. \n\nWhat is it about eating disorders that make them so much harder to understand or empathize? It upsets me because I feel like my friends aren't even trying. And if they are, I don't feel like eating disorders are so complex that you can't see that continuously making body comments (either positive or negative) or other rude/offensive reactions might be detrimental to me. It makes me want to isolate and never talk about it again and just starve myself to death alone in my house.",

When this happened my mom told my whole family about it and it’s been a huge joke ever since. (I’m 21 btw). \nThey all know and understand that I have an eating disorder and that’s what led to the prolapse yet they still joke about it. \nI’m gonna be honest, It’s fucking embarrassing. I can’t go to the restroom without it falling back out. I’m too young for doctors to do any procedures to fix it. It makes me feel disgusting. \nPlease dont be mean in the comments. I just want y’all to be reminded that even though we joke about constipation and our disorders as a whole, we have legitimate illnesses with very real consequences. I love you all. I just really needed to talk about this.",

LIKE DUDE CAN YOU JUST NOT HELP YOURSELF? First of all this sends the message that food has to be justified by restricting (which I hadn’t done), and secondly LITERALLY NO ONE ASKED. I’ve previously expressed that while I understand his reasons for dieting, I would really appreciate it if he didn’t make comments about weight loss/restrictive eating/labelling foods negatively in front of me. I was so frustrated that I blurted out that tweet that goes like ‘Aw you only had an iced coffee today? Shall we tell everyone? Shall we throw a party? Shall we invite Bella Hadid?’ and everyone at the table just looked at me so awkwardly. So basically I made my brothers birthday meal extremely uncomfortable, completely embarrassed myself and ended up >!purging!< later on from food guilt. I hate this so much UGH",

    "selftext": "I truly don’t understand why most experts on ED’s claim it’s not a choice. I consciously thought about it and chose it. I knew what anorexia was and I literally told myself, “I want to go anorexic for the summer.” I didn’t understand the ramifications or reality, but I chose to not eat for the purpose of losing weight. It wasn’t a diet that got out of control. It wasn’t something I fell into. I chose purposefully to do it. \n\n\nI (F20) was 13 when I made this decision. There was something traumatic happening in my life where I was literally physically not in control of my life. And obviously, yes, to cope with that, I restricted. But I didn’t make that connection when it happened. I purely wanted to starve myself to lose weight. Yes, the cause wasn’t my fault. But the way I chose to deal with it, an eating disorder, was a choice. \n\nThis is my long winded way of saying I don’t understand why people say it’s not a choice. I made a choice to “go anorexic.”\n\n\nEDIT: Thank you for everyone breaking it down. I’m still not exactly sure how I see it, but you’re helping me see it in a different way. I’m taking the phrase a bit too literal, I think. Also thank you to those telling me to be nicer to 13 year old me and being patient",

(fun fact that happened to someone at a friend’s party i went to). is it necessary to always bring up someone’s body shape in the conversation???? (“omg that girl has an hourglass figure! LOOK!!!!” — one of my friends). oKAYYYY. maybe i’m just insecure as hell lmao but it becomes uncomfortable at some point.\n\ni once read something about how we should be “body neutral” instead of “body positive” because all the focus on the body is negative. i agree. let’s like... talk about something else please.\n\nEDIT: okay so i really apologize for point 1, i didn’t mean that ALL body positive people “resent skinny people” y’all that came out SO wrong, i’m so sorry. i meant that i’ve seen a portion of instagram influencers that brand themselves as “body positive” say things like “i don’t want to look like a 14 year old boy / child” and “no one wants to look like a stick” and shit like that. you can celebrate a body without putting another one down is basically what i’m saying.\n\nEDIT 2: i apologize for my TERRIBLE grammar in this post LMAOOOO i don't even know how you guys managed to read this but i'm happy to see that i'm not the only one who feels this way and that i was able to get my message across",
