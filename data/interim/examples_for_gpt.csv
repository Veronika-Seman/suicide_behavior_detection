"someone sarcastically told me to kill myself and i just replied "" i tried , didnt work""","he just got silent , then without saying anything just left .

pretty sure i traumatized him ."
"well, there's a possibility i can't b recover my job, and that it may effect me even being able to work in the field. (31/male)","i'm, well maybe was, a delivery driver for amazon, 2019 to now. been through many companies that have collapsed. i loved my job and as of recentlyi was just doing loadout, wasn't being given routes, then i'm told i'm deactivated from not getting a route for a while so the manager decided to terminate me, not even letting me know that point was coming. she blocked my calls. 
i called the corporate head (contractor) and they said they can look into it and probably fix it but i'm not sure. i hope they can save my job. but still. i loved delivering like that.---

the big estate case of my dad is finally ending, i've lost thousands to it. sold my valuables. i haven't even been able to make my 3d art. i love in a house that's worth a lot but has a bunch of junk. my mom is supposed to be back from physical rehab. and my brother is a ""neet"".---

unless the va finally approves his pension for us we're not going to be able to pay our mortgage. all this while just now finally getting back on my luvox (psych med) after several days.--- 

i feel empty, numb, unwanted. i don't even know if i can even apply for the other delivery contractors. this was my favorite job. this was what i loved. 
i sat reading a book for the first time on suicide. and i am already playing don't fear the reaper on repeat. i thought about blocking the band with my truck and killing myself as a final revenge against a manager who turned from nice to cold.----

but i don't feel better, i feel betrayed, i even made an emergency appointment with my psychiatrist no clue what that will change, but the feeling is there that maybe this is just it. i had such a great weekend leading up to this on tuesday.--- 
i can't afford to be broke now. even with only $200 to my name that's gone in less than a bill. 

idk, maybe that's just my sign it's time to get off this train, burn with my home, let the world know i am smart enough to know when it's time to go before things spiral. 

the thought is comforting, it feels like everything goes quiet and then ""life"" is now afraid because i'm no longer afraid to stop it. "
i just lost the longest and best job i have ever had. i'm going to be 50 two years from now. i want to blow my brains out. i wish i was never born.,"hello, i'm 47 and i will be turning fifty in just over two years. i have just lost the best job i have ever had (three years and one month) in it. this job allowed me to do activities that get in shape (physically/mentally) and meet people who accepted me. i have never had a full time job or a salaried job. i have gone from one temp or contract job in it to another. i'm scared and angry that i will never find another job. i want to kill myself more than anything. i have lost all motivation and emotion to continue. i want to kill myself, however, my mom is still around. i have lived with her my whole life. my dad is gone and his bitch second wife cut me out of the will. i have never lived by myself. i have never been married or had kids or had a girlfriend who wasn't by the hour. i feel like i'm a worthless eater and a burden to my mom. i want to kill myself and longer suffer as an american. i want to kill myself and no longer be a burden to the world and the elite who exploit me. i want to kill myself and never feel anything ever again. i want to kill myself and be free of the burden of being around people. i want to kill myself and no longer have the burden of going from one awful it job to another. i want to kill myself so i will never suffer from ageism. i have to face up to the facts that i have always been worthless and a burden to society. i have to face up to the facts that i have never believed and or accepted the idea of others besides my mom and dad (dead) could love me. i have to face up to the fact that the i'm better off dead than being alive and suffering in this world. please god, end my suffering."
the fuck am i supposed to title this?,"i was in therapy for a while because my crappy parents realized how messed up i was. therapy didn't work. my brother is still actively abusing me(mostly verbal and emotional) and i keep forgiving him. he curses at me and screams and tells me to kill myself. well, jokes on him, maybe i will! anytime i tell anyone i want to kill myself, i feel like it's not their problem and i shouldn't burden them. one time i made a joke about suicide to one of my friends and she started sobbing. the next day i had to lie and reassure her that i was indeed not going to kill my self. i'm still a young teenager and i want to experience things, but being dead would be so much easier. the first suicidal thought i had was when i was 9. i have been abused for as long as i can remember(which is not very long, repressed memories are so fun). i haven't told anyone but my bestfriend and joked to other friends, but my best friend is just as depressed as i am so we can't help each other. right now my dogs are locked in the basement(my father did that) and i can hear my brother stomping and screaming at his game in the room above me.

i don't even know or why i'm fucking posting this. any tips for suicidal teens who can't get help?

edit?: a day ago i reported my father for animal abuse(he hits and slaps and curses and screams at the dogs). i anonymously reported to 911 then they left me a voicemail saying they couldn't deal with it so i called the number they left me and to report there i needed to give my name and phone number. "
should i really do it?,"im really young. my parents are the problem. abuse mental and physical. im so damaged from that. i told them several times throughout the years that i want to kill myself. i know they hate me. beacuse im not normal. around 2 years ago a serious problem started. i dont go to school. i find it really hard. i feel pain whenever i have to. its probably from the trauma and the way i am sacred of people. i want to lock myself in the room. they scream at me and fight me for not going. i cry really hard, my eyes are swollen and i am suicidal, thats why i dont go to scool the next day. and the cycle repeats. the only escape is suicide. there is no other way. yes, i did inform police, a year ago. nothing happend. in fact i regret it beacuse they only mocked me. 
now i went normally to school after the break. the next day with had to go to a funeral. i was ok with that. they just needed to wake me up in the morning. 1,5h before they wanted to leave for it they started screaming and insulting me how bad i am and why the f am i not already awake and stuff like that. 1h and 30min...that is absolutely enough time for me to get ready. i started crying....i needed time to calm down. they went into my room and stuff happened. ""you are the problem"" ""we will kick you out the moment you turn 18"" ,and they really expected me to just wake up and go with them after that. i feel like this is not about me and if im going to school or not. they just hate me. whenever they are stressed or something goes wrong they just need to take it out on me, by abusing me. its been like this for years, in fact i cant remember times when it was different. i do go to a psychologist just beacuse the police pushed my mom to sign me, not that she cares. but i never told him about the long term abuse. only about one situation. 
i know i have no future. i am failing school because of all this shit. i know its not gonna get better. i thought that it will be. i always think that it can be better. but it never actually is. i am gonna work in a job i hate. i will earn minimum wage. i dont want this. i want to work in a nice job. i want to be a doctor, or something like that. i could do this. i could be a doctor but in current situation i cant. 
i really dont know what to do. i am too scared to kill myself but at the same time i know it wont get any better. if i kill myself i would need to abandon all my dreams,desires just so i can be free from the pain. i live for the dreams, but the dreams and desires will never be fulfilled if the pain wont end. i dont want to die but i dont want to live like this. i also have no strength to get over it. everyone hates me and nobody cares about me. i have 0 people in my life. i am serious. zero.
i need to wake up for school in an hour. what should i do? "
i plan my suicide 1-3 times per day,"if i get an urge to end my life while i'm at work, out running errands, with friends, etc., i usually zone out without realizing and think through exactly how i can kill myself after i leave that function. e.g. ""i can go to this store for a rope but they close at 9, so i'll have to leave early, then i can go here, so on and so forth"". 

does anyone else have this issue ? i'll usually zone out for 30 seconds or so and people are wondering why i look all spaced out"
i feel bad for drinking,"alcohol helps me a lot especially with just zoning out and forgetting everything. i smoke also which helps with the stress of a few things.

these things are forbidden in my religion so i feel bad for doing them. genuinely cannot see my life without these things though. it helps me bare this life and even keeps me alive in a way because i would probably o.f.f myself without these thing that dull the stress and pain.

even with these things the temptation of ending it all is getting stronger. the ultimate way to dull your pain forever. then i remember my religion forbids that as well smh."
people don’t care about men’s mental health.,i’m 19 for context. my whole life has been people telling me to man up. to take responsibility. nobody cares about me and the reason why because i’m a man. nobody cares how you feel. and at this point i don’t either. now they will be forced to. just like i’m forced into this corner with no way out but suicide. always was terrible at anything i’ve tried so it’s not like i’m missing out on my future.
"i am getting married in 2 months, i want to kill myself before it happens","a marriage i don't like 

a life i don't want

my parents who are dead

relatives who act as didn't hear when i tell i am suicidal 


lived whole life trying to please others , always self doubting , always careful to not cross line.

i don't want to live like a coward anymore. i want to be brave and take decision for myself now and the first thing i want to do is break this marriage , i can only achieve it by being dead


edit : thank you all for your supporting words. yesterday night i talked with my sister in law about this . how i am suffering and how suicidal i am. sh was understanding and said kind words, told i should start sharing if i felt like that. i shared how i am not able to get along with him, and she said she understood and told me i should have shared sooner. i felt very relived. i slept peacefullyafter a long time. today morning she is acting like nothing happened, talking about marriage plans like how we should check out community hall for pre wedding functions, rent a bus for grooms guests,  talking about post marriage things. talking as if yesterday didn't happen

i'm going crazy, what did i do wrong ? maybe i was right all along , only death can get me out of this madness

suicide help in korea,"hello.

is there any way to get suicide help in korea?

i've called the hotline that is most advertised, but it didn't really help (felt like i was persuaded to feel better when i wasn't)"
therapist cried throughout my session about my suicide,"i think i triggered them. they said that someone they knew died by suicide and that’s what was making them emotional. i feel really bad for upsetting them, but i’m also really at a loss because i feel like i can’t talk to my therapist about how suicidal i’m feeling anymore. 

everything is losing its grip on me. i’ve been in this place a 100 times since i was a child and i’m really really feeling that things aren’t going to be changing for me  since i feel like this so often. i have complex ptsd. i’m getting closer to suicide, and i’ve just lost a major support because of how upset they were. i don’t know what to do. i don’t have the capacity to get a new therapist, so it feels like everything is coming together for me to just end things, as the therapy was my last
hope"
alarming thoughts,"i'm not sure if it this is the best place to say this, but i did used to be suicidal, or at least is still am but i not totally consumed by it. but pretty recently after being desensitized to people not caring for me and if i killed myself any day no one would know or care, i switched to loving the idea of harming someone they do care about instead and not even in a civilized way either, i won't deny, i would enjoy to make the scene gruesome, i started to feel this way a bit tamer when i fantasized about the idea of ""forcing"" a suicide pact between me and my partner, (someone who also feels suicidal) and fascinations i have over the sound and look of my flesh being opened with a knife. but now it's a bit scary to me that these feelings leak into making people lose a loved one because i have no one to love me and miss me when i die. also im 15 btw"
"turning 44 on the 27th, grandma died in my teens, mom and dad when i was in my early/mid 20s","lost all of my pets. have no siblings no other family and no friends
i play games alone and solo because i can't find anyone. no girlfriend or wife, no kids, bad teeth and in major debt while living on disability. i am so tired of living if you call it living. i am slowly drowning. i am so tired of this life. 

i will be ending it on my bday. just can't see myself going anymore especially solo, unloved and unwanted. just can't do it anymore."
is failed suicide covered by insurance,"i'm from canada. in america right now for another 2 months. if i mess up, does traveler's insurance cover failed attempts hospital bills?"
"best friend killed himself, i want to join him","my best friend killed himself at the end of september, and i still can't handle it. i'm 28/f, and he was 30/m.

he was the most amazing person i had ever known, and he told me once last june about his plans to commit suicide. i tried to support him, but he killed himself months afterwards. i know that, as i was at the time, i couldn't be the reason he would want to live, but it hurts so much that he left me. he was the only one who would or could help.

i called him crying very late one night, when he had a test the next day at 8 a.m., and he came over and spent the night with me and then took his test on two hours of sleep, and aced it because he was a genius. how am i ever going to find a guy like him again? i loved him, but i never told him, and he died all alone, feeling like he was unloved.

i've cried every night since he died, wishing i could join him in death. i can't feel anything for anyone else. he made me feel beautiful and loved and cared for in a way i never thought was possible. now he's gone...forever. i'm such a failure. i failed him. i never made him feel like he made me feel. he used to put his hand on my cheek, and tell me that i was the most beautiful and perfect girl in the world to him. now, i pretend my pillow is his hand as i cry myself to sleep.

i failed him. i was insecure and had intimacy issues, and i never told him how he was the most beautiful man in the world. he was everything. he had led such a hard and tragic life, but still he found the strength in himself to take care of everyone he cared for, including me. when i told him my father had sexually abused me, i expected him to run for the door. instead, he held me and told me that he accepted me and loved me no matter what, and that i was still beautiful to him. i'm sobbing, remembering the unconditional love he gave me.

i can't exist without him. i reach my arms out into the air sometimes when i'm trying to fall asleep, hoping i can feel his arms around me again. why didn't i tell him that i loved him? why did i assume i would see him again? i feel so guilty. i just want to feel his love again, and to smell him as he hugs me. he gave the best hugs in the world.

i just want to die and be with him again. i want to tell him that i love him.

shane...i love you. i'm so sorry you died alone, and that i wasn't there. i'm sorry you died feeling like no one loved you, because i do. if only i had shown you what was in my heart, maybe you would have stayed. i'm sorry. i love you with all of my heart. i know you wanted me to live, but i can't without you. you were the only one for me, but i was too stupid to let you in. i'll see you soon, my love, which is the first time i've called you that.

stuck between a rock and a hard place,"honestly, i'm not even too sure if i can wait until april anymore. i'm sick and tired of living and i want to kill myself right now, but i'm afraid i won't have my method ready if i do it now. i got into an argument with my mom that i know i was in the wrong about, but i just simply do not care anymore. for years, i dealt with this shitty life and i just want it all to end. i'm tired of trying to please everyone, i'm tired of ""doing what's right,"" i simply could not care less if i'm being an asshole, i'm just sick and tired of having to be here. i just can't fucking take this shit anymore."

dissociation and hell anxiety ,"i’m 35, were living my normal life, and one i looked in the mirror and my life just broke. i’ve lost my personality, my feelings, just shaking in fear. 3 months of treatment and i’m at square o, nothing helping. i just couldn’t live like this and couldn’t kill myself. but have such huge agitation to open window and jump. i think something inside me wants to fight but it’s literally hell every day."
suicidal thoughts,"i cant stop thinking about suicide. it does not even feel normal if i dont think about it, but i feel like i dont have the courage to attempt anymore. i attempted suicide a few times, around 13 times, cant remember exactly how many and i dont know what counts as an attempt. i tried different methods but mostly overdose. i always feel embarrassed. im worthless and i would be better off dead. i was told to kill myself so many times, even my family told me to kill myself. i used to cry almost every night but now it became harder for me to cry. i cut myself almost daily, i spend a lot of my time rotting in bed. my family cant stop fighting and it is effecting me a lot, im having a hard time remembering things and studying. i miss when i had the courage to attempt suicide"
fuck everything. fuck christmas. fuck everyone. ,"cheers to the worst one of my life.  
i can’t figure out a mess free, quick and easy way out so here i am sobbing while i wish that i could slip my face under the water of my bath and never resurface or wishing i had the courage to take a knife to my wrists. but instead i’m a fucking pussy.    
stop telling me to be strong. stop commending my resilience. stop telling me i can’t give up. stop telling me i have to keep pushing forward.   
i am fucking tired. i want to find peace, tranquility.  
i can’t take this hellscape called life much longer.  
i try and i try and i try but i still get pushed down, demonized, shit on, never enough. never good enough. never smart enough. never pretty enough. never trying hard enough.     
i know i’m not the best person but i try fuck i fucking try so hard to be good. and it means nothing.   
maybe it’s for the better i have nobody anymore.   
maybe soon i’ll get the balls and not give a fuck how i go out as long as i go out.    
i understand why my mom and her sister both killed themselves now. i really, really do.  "
"i’m a fucking loser tw:substance issues,rape,suicide","im 17f. i’m depressed and suicidal because of rape when i was a child and bullying  and kidnapping attempt on me and shit. when i was 12 i attempted suicide for the first time. and i wish i died back then because my life is so much worse now. more trauma. my life is just trauma after trauma really. i’ve been abused in a special needs school. had to save my friend who tried to kill herself infront of me. another friend overdosed on coke infront of me and had a seizure not on purpose he overdid it and i didn’t do drugs back so i didn’t know what to do i called an amulance and my friend hated me for snitching because i could’ve gotten him in trouble. i was self harming to cope with this at 11 but worse after all of this extra trauma. i got diagnosed with ptsd at 14. around this time instead of self harm i started drinking and vaping and doing drugs so i didn’t have to deal with the constant memories of what happened and stuff. 

now i’m such a loser. i have unrelated health issues so had to stop going to college (uk). i spend most of my days in bed wanting to kill myself. today i went and got edibles and got am bottle of vodka too from the shops. i have a fake id but by now cause um a regular he doesn’t even check. the highlight of my day was the shopkeeper flirting with me saying i’m hot even though really i’m not and giving me a discount on the vodka. which is just sad really i mean why is that my highlight? honestly it’s the best thing that’s happened to me in months probably. everyone hates me.

my flashbacks get worse at night. it’s currently 1 in the morning and my flashbacks have been bad. i drank half of the bottle even though i was trying to stick to a quater and i don’t even think i’m that drunk. i’ve also don’t two edibles and have been vaping as well just to extra be able to forget but no.

usually i’d be too out of it to care but every once in a while like today i feel worse and just want to die even more.

what has my life even come too? 

everything was great until i was 8(when the trauma started) i genuinely think if i never had the traumas i would be so successful. i was smart and kind and funny and easygoing. and i had a lot of potential. now i’m dumb and depressed and not easy to have a conversation with and just genuinely the worst person to ever live i do so much awful and dumb shit.

i just want it to all be over. no one cares about me. i just want someone to love me unconditionally. i have no friends and i’m going to be homeless when i’m 18 because my family hate me and so can’t get a paid job. 

i just want someone to actually listen to me and care about me. but they don’t. no one does. and it just keeps getting worse and worse because i can’t deal with the trauma like at all. i want to get over it but i can’t. 

i have no one. i’m just so fucking lonely. "
"please, i just want to die ….","i just do not want to live anymore. i am an embarrassment to myself, my wife, my child and i truly believe they would be better off without me in their lives. this week, i truly think i am going to go purchase a firearm for killing myself. i just cannot deal with life any more…. "
i’m ready to die,"just ready to die, can’t take it anymore…i just wanna die in my sleep or just kill myself easily…i can’t do it, can’t can’t can’t can’t can’t can’t can’t can’t can’t…i’m done…
i’m tired…
i had enough of this…
i hate myself…
i’m so lonely…
it’s my fault…
i think i’m just gonna end it all…
yea…goodnight"
the amount of people suffering here is insane,"do you sometimes realize that the amount of people suffering from severe depression and on the brink of killing themselves on this subreddit and outside of this subreddit really speaks the painful truth about our socaity and our world in general? the world we live in ladies and gentlemen are crule uncaring and cold
in this socaity we view the mentaly ill as an outcast an alien a very disgusting and unacceptable creature....which we pretend to care about and try to ""help"" them
if you suffer from cancer or any other illness people can actually acknowledge your pain and know you are suffering
they know how hug your scars are
but with mental illness people sometimes understemate your suffering
people understemate how severe your depression actually is
people say go get therapy, take anti depressiants but its not a 100% cure it never cured everyone((i myself took pills but it never worked))
actually depression and other disorders
never had a magical cure like we have on flu...yet we dont take it seriously 
and the result? suicide

i really wish depression was like a flu it could get away with some medicine
but no ...its like a curse...once you get it
its gonna never stop hurting you
only if its not too late and only if you got some huge will to live you maybe can get through it ...maybe
its like a snake ...eats you from the inside out
first it eats your will to live and then it eats your ability to enjoy things 
and finally when it really completely took over your mind and body ...it will make you wish for death and later on plan it
this snake feeds on neglect truamatizing events
and deep scars left unhealed...and we can only destroy this cursed snake with care , love and good treatment
not risk truamatize suicidal people with more shit...i swear people could never understand us and only the ones who suffer like us can only understand what if really feels like to have this shitty disorder...
if only people could at least show a bit of understand and care
we would'nt ever get to this point
that idea really makes me hate humanity and myself even more...everything bad happens to us is what we deserve 
we all cold and greedy
we all just take take and take
we never give
we never gave to eachother nor to this poor plant
we all deserve to die 
no one is good
if there is good left in us its only minor
god if you even exist please end us already
please end me...i dont want to see myself living inside this hell forever
the hell is in me and in the world
i can never fix myself nor i can fix the fucked up world
the best i could do is just die

edit : one day and this many upvotes? well i gusse there are a lot of people who get me , wow im not completely misunderstood for being a sick fuck!
thanks for you all ....you all are my shining hope in this darkness ...im lost here and trying to find my way out of here...
well at least the moment i die i could still think back and see i was never alone in how i saw this world"
something about knowing i can kill myself any time is what keeps me alive,"idk if this is weird but with everything going on (the world, my life, school, work, friends, family) going badly, i know that i can kill my self anytime and be done with all of it. it’s like an escape route. but ironically it’s what keeps me living through all of this shit because i tell myself to try anyways and if i cant i’ll just kill myself. idk does this make me not actually suicidal or what"
i’m definitely gonna kill myself tomorrow night!,"i’m done being yelled at,insulted,and abused physically,verbally,emotionally and mentally! my family is extremely toxic,narcissistic and love gaslighting me for shit they’ve done! i need to get away from my family! i want to move to indiana to be with my sister but i’m disabled and don’t get enough to pay a whole rent myself and i’m not on section 8 or any form of rental assistance. been thinking a lot lately about having a job but no one wants to hire me in connecticut because i’m white. so i started thinking of prostituting myself to make enough to get my own place. if i get hiv or a terminal disease hopefully it’ll kill me fast. if not i hope i get murdered. i’m transgender 🏳️‍⚧️ mtf and i don’t live far from a place that’ll accept my transgender lifestyle. i need a bf or gf that’ll help me. i’ve even considered becoming an adult film actress but idk i’m not skinny and attractive. i’m fat and ugly. someone please date me and let me live with you permanently and don’t hit me. all i want is to be loved and to love in return. i’m very kinky and freaky and am open to lots of things that are legal. hmu if you can help me please. help me please!"
"funny when they say ""suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem""","when all your existing is the problem in the first place 
when  life is just one big pain in the ass

to me personally i feel like everything is just a big waste of time ...this life is just not good enough not fullfilling enough
its so cold and boring and so so tiring
it's really dreadful 


some people do have temporary problems ...but the others have problems that wont be fixed 
like loss of a loved one or someone you love cheat on you or leave you alone

(( some people can't really get over these tramatic events happend to them not everyone can ""heal"" magically))
and like depression too...(some people tried everthing to overcome depression but they failed)

so please stop saying that really stupid thing to others who is at the edge of their lives
it will only make them feel more gulit and shame then they already do

(no hate in the comments thats only my opinion) 

edit : holy shit omg thanks for all of you commenting on this post...it got attention really fast lol i gusse im not the only one feeling this way huh..."
"feel empty, used, and suicidal","i fucked up my brain with porn. i used porn to cope and get relief from depression and suicidal thoughts. but this recently escalated, now im no longer just watching porn, im messaging random men, posting myself in sexual positions for attention. im a freak and disgusting, i want to die. im 18 and my brain is still rapidly developing and i feel like i ruined my brain and sexuality. ive messaged so many people in the last month or so (when i started posting and messaging) that i just feel used up and empty. i feel awful and like i just want the constant pain to end. i don’t know why im making this post because no one is gonna care, but fuck it i had to say it somewhere. i ruined my brain and became some sort of fucked up degenerate. i fucking hate myself, i can’t even call myself a man. i wish someone could tell me it will be okay, and i wish i could believe them."
there might be hope. but not for me. suicide is rational.,"i am so tired of living. nobody can convince me that this shit is worth it. absolutely everything in my life is a shit show. even my own girlfrield says that she would have killed herself long ago if she were me. 

i dont even know where to begin. i am almost forty and have never had a higher than barely minimum wage salary. this despite being a phd student with a masters, loads of teaching experience, etc. yet having spent 10 years studying at university has made me so poor, that there is no chance i will ever get out of debt.

i am an alcoholic and drug addict, and drug addict. which have gone to several rehabs and been in and out of aa - as well as being forcibly committed to a psych ward because of risk of suicide. my wife left me because of all of my shit - and took our identical triplet sons with her and they now live in another country. i get to see them maybe 1-2 a year, depending on if i can afford the trip, which is rare. 

  
its been years, and i have pretty much become a stranger to them and they dont want to talk to me anymore. and the child support i owe for all of them is so astronomical by now i will never be able to pay it. i couldnt even pay rent or for food for myself most months because of my shit university non-salary.

if you think finishing the phd will help, you are sorely mistaken, because competition for academic positions in my field (and others) is so insane that you might as well try the lottery instead. and i have no qualifications for anything else. i teach part time, for slave wages, and work at a center for handicapped people to make ends meet - which i dont. 

i have been sober for 8 months until tonight. what the fuck is the point of being sober? i have already lost everything, and have no future. its not like i have any more to lose. doing all the drugs until i am dead is not a sick way of thinking - it is a perfectly rational response to this hopeless life. 

oh and p:s: i have some ridiculously rare genetic disease where i am missing lots of teeth. my parents never bothered to fix it when i was young, and now it would be torture - if i could afford to get it fixed which is laughable. so i basically have hillbilly mouth. 

there is no point to any of this. i cant take it anymore.  "
how to fix suicidal ideation?,"hi; i'm so depressed and i'm not going to kill myself but i think about suicide all the time, and have been this way for years. wtf do i do? do i need meds? "
sometimes i think dying before i turn 20 ties up my story nicely,"i don't know i don't know i don't know. i've been feeling bad lately and after some thought, i decided this subreddit is best. 

i am currently 18, turning 19 next week. i look back at my life and i don't know how i feel about it.

 my parents immigrated to the philippines for a better life. i got enrolled into one of those multi-cultural filipino schools. ever since i was in kindergarten, i've always been fearful of people, esp classmates and teachers. i clung to my mother with separation anxiety. i would always cry when distressed. looking back, she def hated it and was morbidly embarrassed. 

another issue that worsened my anxiety was culture clash. i grew up watching english cartoons and speaking my native languages. i didn't realize it at the time, but the culturally filipino folks hated me because i wasn't ""respectful"" like a filipino would be. i would get bullied and taken advantage of at a young age. i couldn't speak up because i didn't understand filipino. i was scared to ask for help because i thought i deserved the bullying. i may not understand, but i get it. also i only get attention when i get good at certain subjs, which i literally clung onto as my identity. 

the effects of childhood bullying became apparent as i reached high school. i had no friends, misinterpreted social cues, and everyone hated me (or could be in my head, who knows. there's def truth somewhere in my thoughts. i probably came off as arrogant as i suffered gifted child syndrome. i had no social skills and envy people with talent, friends, honors, awards, etc. ugh. 

i get punished for doing things to others when they literally have done the same to me. somehow, it's on me for missing the nuance. 

looking back, all those 15 years in that school was miserable. it was bullying and discrimination but somehow my fault.

 i'm in college now. miraculously, i got accepted into a prestigious one, despite my crappy grades in high school. it's here it is apparent how developmentally behind i am compared to my peers. i thought college would be a fresh start. i'd have friends and be somebody. 

nope. 2nd year now. i have a ""friend group"", but i knew we were only friends because i spent enough time with them for them to accept my presence. but i don't have much common ground with them. can't say i haven't tried. 

i've tried joining extracurriculars like them. i do admire those who are active in extracurriculars like student government or charities. i envy their close relationships with peers and colleagues. my grades aren't also as great as theirs. i don't have the leadership skills. i rely on chatgpt for my works. 

dread hitted me as i realized i gotta do internship in a few years. i have no idea how to do that. that fills me with dread and anxiety. i realized i am going to be eaten alive by the real world. i don't even know how i am going to make money here. i have no skills to offer. i don't even like the people and culture here. i have no future in this country. 

i also realized my college graduation might be delayed due to some ill-informed choices i made during 1st year. i didn't think that far ahead. i guess my family can afford it... am i spoiled and sheltered? 

also i firmly hated being aggressive and assertive. brings back trauma. but i heard you gotta be a little scary if you want to be respected in the workplace. i've had teachers spreading rumors about me and employing humiliation and allowing namecalling. (mind you, if i ever do those to anyone, i will get punish. why is it ok for it to be done to me?) 

i knew it was because of my upbringing that i differ from my peers. the difference is now staggering as time had passed on. 

i just realized a few days ago that i have a superiority complex as a trauma response. to cope with the trauma of mistreatment, i spun a narrative that i am special. in reality, i am just the same as everyone else, but *more unfortunate.* it's hard to accept as it brings back anger. *if i am the same as everyone else, then why was i unfairly treated?*

i look back at my life and wondered: what went wrong? 

if i'm aggressive, i get punished for it. if i'm meek, i get taken advantage of and blamed for it. i lose opporunities and get left behind. i have no talent, no skills. 

maybe someone might tell me to ""start learning something useful"". i don't know if i'd be good at it tbh. 

i have been suicidal since 7th grade. nobody cares. (looking back, they aren't obligated to tbh). i mentally disowned my parents after an incident in 7th grade that made me realized how awful the world is. mentally, i'm an orphan.

now i'm 18 and i wonder why am i defying my destiny if clearly suicide is meant to be. 

wouldn't it be phenomenally tragic if i die before i reach 19, and it was destined from the start? or i never made it to 20 because i don't see my life worth living. i never had a future. 

(i have no clear plans. just existential dread and an inferiority complex)

why do i make this post? 

idk, i guess i just want someone to care??? for once in my life? ugh"
help.,"
i’m going to kill myself this month if nothing get better, i’m only 14 years old, what did i do to want to die so young? i’d wish i was never born actually. i’d wish being loved without having to beg for it.
can someone just talk to me please? i’m really scared, please."
everything triggers me and i don’t know how to handle it anymore,"throughout 2022 i was repeatedly raped and sexually assaulted by my ex. he coerced and threatened me to do things and would break down if i said no. it was a horrible time, i was 16 years old.


nowadays everything triggers me. if i hear a song i used to listen to back then. if someone mentions baseball. a specific shade of blue. and sa scenes from movies or shows make me want to curl up and die. i just watched this movie called i used to be funny and it sent me into a full on breakdown. most of the time i feel disgusting and ashamed even though i did nothing wrong. i feel mad at myself for giving in. i want to die sometimes. because everytime i hear about someone being raped i feel so angry, disgusted, helpless, afraid, i don’t even know. 


i’m super sensitive and always have been and i don’t know how to handle it anymore. i’m currently seeking out therapy but i have little faith that it will be enough. do any survivors have tips to share? i don’t wanna feel this way anymore "

anyone also getting suicidal thoughts when seeing happy stuff?,"kind of a question rather than a suicide post but i just needed to get this off my mind.

so, whenever my friends send me cute stuff of their friends to them, or just happy/cute things, i immediately think about killing myself, and i'm honestly not sure why. anyone else has them too?"
i’m tired ,"i hate that the only thing my mom can tell me is to not kill myself bc i have her and my dog, which it’s true i do have them. but i just want the pain to end and nothing but time can take it away but i don’t want to wait. it’s so unbearable. i just relapsed from cutting a few minutes ago and i was at lease a few years clean. cutting isn’t enough i need to die this is painful, and idk what to do to stay alive anymore. even worse! my mom said to not shed another tear on my current situation and i’m trying so hard, it’s just hurts so much. it’s literally been a week. i want to get over it now."
i really want to die,"i hate m life so much nothing makes sense anymore everyone who once loved me is hating me for who i am. my boyfriend can’t take my outbursts of feelings anymore and my friends and family are not talking to me anymore. i always knew i was a horrible person now they can see it too. i really don’t know what to do, sometimes hitting my head but i’m too scared to do more. so here i am hating myself and everyone hitting myself for being me. "
please make me not kill myself,"im just so goddamn tired of my bpd, it’s ruining my life in every possible way. my friends are dead tired of me and don’t even allow me to vent anymore. im tired of all of this shit. im planning to attempt once again on the weekend. im tired of not being my past self, tired of upsetting everyone around me, tired of being so sensitive, tired of being literally alone in all of this and having no one to support me. therapy isn’t working at all"

i just overdosed and dont want to die,i overdosed a few hours ago and i can't tell my parents i'm 15 and i can't call 911 but i want to live how do i help myself i tried throwing up but i could barely do so please hurry i'm running out of time in getting really sleepy
"since september, the only thought going through my head has been death: either mine or theirs.","i think about killing myself often. it's been a fleeting thought for most of my life, but it has exacerbated recently. i want to die. but it's less about ceasing to exist and more about ending the suffering. sometimes i wonder if i really want to die or if i just want my life to get better. i also think about other people dying too. particularly the guy who fucked me over. he asked me what he could do for me to finally be okay and i snapped at him telling him to die so i could be happy.

and what i hate about it is that my problems don't seem as big as other people's. 

my parents keep fighting over a ten-year-old issue of my dad supposedly cheating and i don't even know if there is any truth to it. i don't care to find out. a guy left me for another girl without telling me he was with her, stringing me on for a week until i finally found out. he was the only person i ever opened up to about my parents and he still fucked me over. he said sorry, but it just wasn't enough for me because he doesn't seem to have any regret or remorse for the pain and trauma he caused me. i got made fun of and bullied over social media by his girlfriend and her friends even though i never wanted to hurt her because i didn't know. 

but i still do well in school. my grades never slipped. i make some money on the side. i buy new makeup. i still have my friends who have loved me and supported me since day one. i was granted a good scholarship even though i was sure i did poorly on the qualifying exam.

it shouldn't feel like the end of the world. i'm still getting what i want. i should feel blessed because of how lucky i am. but every day, the feeling just gets worse. sometimes i am able to get it out of my head for a bit. i talked to our guidance counselor and poured out what i have been bottling up for months. but i relapse often when i'm alone lying in my bed at night, wondering what is so wrong with me and why i couldn't be enough and what did i ever do to deserve any of this."
the end,i have a question. it's an honest question. what do you think is a good age to commit suicide? 
surprisingly enough,"somehow this place makes even suicide feel cringe so thanks i guess lol

kicked me out of the depressed mood a little"
my sister walked in.,"my sister walked in on me trying to take my own life. she kind of just stood there and stared at me. i stared back for a minute and my sister started saying how she knew this would happen because of the bad things i think about. i broke down and started crying in my sister's arms, and after i stopped crying she told me that she knew i was trying my best, and sometimes your best feels like your worst, she told me that she loved me and that she wanted to see me smile but some days that just isn't an option, then she grabbed my arm and she took me outside to play in the snow and distract me, we made a snowman and god i'm so glad i got to make that damn ugly snowman. (snowman melted though, it's unfortunate.)

but she shouldn't even know what it means to commit suicide, she's 11, and i'm 19. that is what truly hurt me, our parents educated her on suicide, what it means, and how to act if she ever sees somebody trying to kill themselves, they knew it would happen one day or another."
how do i get out of here,"how do i get out of my household? how do i go to fostercare? how do i be put up for adoption? i am a child and i want to be adopted by someone else. i want to be in another home. both of my parents abuse me. i just realized i only want to die because i'm stuck with my parents. if i had loving parents i wouldn't want to die anymore. please help me. someone please save me. i'm too scared to tell anyone about what my parents do. i don't have evidence except low quality clips of them yelling at me,. they are good at smoothtalking. i don't want to go to court or deal with government people or crisis services nobody will believe me and i'm scared. once i open my mouth my dad will beat me and he will destroy everything i have. he told me if i tell anyone he abuses me he will smash my computer and phone over his knee. please. i want out of here. can i leave without telling anyone all the details? please, i can't wait 4 more years. please someone anyone please tell me how to leave how do i get new parents i hate my parents please someone help me help help help help"
i'm going to kill myself because of my neighbors ,"i live in a low income/income based apartment. i have neighbors to the left and right side of me, but not above or below. the waiting list for these units is incredibly long. i was homeless for almost a year before i got into mine, and i only got in that soon because my psychiatrist pulled some strings with an emergency services worker (they help with housing and getting necessities and whatnot). 

i've been here for about 5 years now. i've had the same neighbors the whole time. 
the neighbors to the right of me are drug addicts, alcoholics, and have no volume control. they yell when they talk to eachother, stomp so hard that it vibrates my floors, and bang on things all the time. i've had to call the cops on them for fighting 5 times in the last 2 months. last week, they fought all night and kept me awake. they finally got quiet around 4 am, but woke me back up at 5 with their fighting. i called the cops, cops came and left, and the fighting started right back up for 2 more hours. 

they also blare their music. it's in the leasing agreement that volume should not be loud enough to disturb other tenants. i've spoken to the leasing managers many times. sent them many emails and recordings. they tell me they're trying to figure out what to do, but nothing ever happens. i've even told them that i have reached my mental limit, but still nothing. 

the problem is, i'm autistic. this always has me on edge and overstimulated. i work at a school, so it's loud and overwhelming all day just for me to come home to this. i have no time to mentally recover. it's burned me out so badly that all i do is lay in bed when i'm home, sleeping when i can if they aren't too loud. 

i can't afford to move anywhere else. there are no other income based/low income apartments here because it's a fairly small town. 

i am so incredibly depressed and overwhelmed and anxious all the time. i've developed a heart condition because of the stress i'm always under. i have migraines constantly. i cry all the time. i don't want to have to wear noise canceling headphones all the time. i want to be able to relax and watch my own tv without having to have it screaming at me just to cover the noise from my neighbors. i have no peace. i can't take it anymore.

at the end of the school year, i will be killing myself. i want to wait until then so i don't put the school in a tough spot without me, and i care about the kids and don't want to disappear on them. at least they'll forget about me over the summer. 

i'm hoping i can last til then. i have so many meltdowns and panic attacks. i feel like i can't breathe even typing this out. i need it to end. "
i feel like an imposter,"i feel like i've tricked everyone around me into believing i'm a good person. i know i'm not, i know i'm annoying and neurodivergent and traumatized and not a good friend and i can never keep it up for long. i'm always struggling, barely making ends meet, and i can feel the disappointment when that happens. at least once a year i fall into suicidal lapses where my crippling fear of death that keeps me up at night fades away and immediately i just want to die. i feel like i've never stopped being the same mentally ill, possessive, obnoxious child retreating into fantasy who needs everyone's help and attention and i hate her. i hate her so much. but i can't grow out of her and i can't stop being her because the trauma has informed every part of who i am and i want it to stop. i wish i was someone else or i wish i was dead or something. just so i didn't keep living through these cycles of everyone around me learning how sick i am and then leaving"
i don't see a future for myself like this,"i wish i could close my eyes and just die in my sleep. everything's awful. nothing ever goes well for me and i'm starting to despise everything and everyone around me except maybe my cats. whenever something mildly great happens, something 10 times worse happens right after.

 i can't take care of myself no matter how hard i try. i'm too sensitive and that ruins my interactions with everyne. my grades suck and i can't get myself to study. i'm ugly, no matter how hard i try to become pretty, and now i'm eating a lot and i'm becoming chubbier and chubbier and i'm getting the urge to stick two fingers in my throat and spit all of it out. i keep my head down when i'm walking and now i almost have a permanent shrimp posture. i ruined my curls to straighten my hair and look more girly so people would like me more but i still get made fun of everyday by all of my clasmates. even my fugliest classmates shuts the door in my face after holding it open from everyone else. people pick the disabled guy over me when they have to make the volleyball teams and sometimes, when they make groups for projects, they ""forget"" to add me and the teacher has to squeeze me in a group with someone and it's super awkward. 

they throw volleyballs at me on purpose and then pretend to be apologetic while their friends giggle behind them. it hurts and it's embarrassing.

when i walk behind my classmates they giggle and say ""look who's behind us"". they make dirty rumors about me and it's embarrassing to walk into class when you know they've been saying stuff like that about you, while when i'm actually in class it's like i don't exist. i feel like a waste of space and air.

it's always been like this since forever, it'll never change. i have 0 social skills because of it and it's killing me. i feel like i'm going to die alone.

my parents don't care about my health, they only care about my shitty grades. my dad only recently stopped beating me up over them and that's embarrassing.

the only thing that was keeping me going were videogames and that's embarrassing as fuck. lately not even those are helping at all.

i really don't get why i'm living at this point. i've been considering suicide for i don't know how long and i've even attempted to overdose just to throw up and get sick like two times. i can't make my parents proud. i can't make myself proud. i can't make anyone proud because nobody wants me in the first place, i've never had a best friend in my whole life, or a friend who'd stick to me and tell me ""happy new year"" or a family that'd reach out.

the only thing actually keeping me here is one of my two cats, but i don't know how much more i can take. everything keeps getting worse as time goes by."
my father is tired of me “hurting” my mother. he is offering to find me an apartment so i can live alone and away from her. i will use this opportunity to kill myself.,"as i mentioned in previous posts, my mother is emotionally and physically abusive to me. she has the gal to blame me for enraging her to do these things. my father is getting tired of her constant tantrums, and is offering to give me an apartment he will pay for so she can be free of me.

i will use this to my advantage to finally end my own life. once i am alone in my apartment, with no one to stop me or witness me, i will overdose on all my medication pills at the same time. then, i will die and finally know peace. maybe then my parents will know peace too."
how do i avoid hurting the people i care about?,"from the outside, i have a pretty nice life. i had a great childhood with a loving family and i'm surrounded by great friends. despite this, i can't shake the feeling that i'll never be happy.

my whole life i grew up with the dream of working in the film industry and making movies. i thought from a young age that because i was so dedicated and put so much effort into this dream that my passion could carry me. i thought that if you believed in yourself, anything was possible.

my first wake up call was when i only got into my last two choices of the six universities i applied to. the rejection hurt, but i was still optimistic and hoped i could get a great education. when i started school, i immediately felt like an outsider. i was a shy, sober kid at one of the country's top party schools. i felt alone. i isolated myself because i didn't want to give into the frat party lifestyle and just wanted to focus on my degree and making movies. during my sophomore year, i found a small group of friends and started hanging out with them...until covid struck that semester. i spent two of my last four semesters at home, and one of those semesters on campus social hang outs were strictly prohibited. by the time i graduated, that group of people were still the closest friends i had on campus, but were far from feeling like ""close friends.""

upon graduating, i wasn't able to find a job in the film industry. this was frustrating, but it allowed me to move home and save up money for a little while. i was never able to secure a job in the industry, so i got desperate and got an entry-level job with a big corporation in the entertainment industry, however not in the field i wanted. i didn't mind this, i saw it as a way to get my foot in the door with this company and hopefully move to something more career-relevant in a short period of time.

two and a half years have gone by. to date, i have applied for 72 jobs with this company that are closer to the career i studied for, have personal experience in, and have spent my whole life wanting to work in. i have not attained an interview for a single one of these jobs. outside of this company, i've applied for film-related entry level jobs at small companies and big companies, all with the same result -- no one is interested.

i've lost the passion i once had for this field. i used to spend all my free time on personal projects to build my portfolio, but what's the point now? i'm a failure. it came to a head last fall when i checked myself into a hospital because i had become overwhelmed by suicidal thoughts. i went in with the hope of trying to talk to someone about my feelings and seeking guidance and what i got was feeling like i was put in prison where they could test medications on me (medications which, as i would learn over the coming months, only made me feel worse). i left the hospital after a couple days, and two weeks later my girlfriend broke up with me because my mental health was too draining on her. i don't blame her, but it certainly wasn't good timing for me.

my girlfriend was my best friend and the one person i could trust to be there for me over the past year and a half (even before we started dating). we stayed friends after breaking up and i appreciated her for still allowing me to confide in her when i needed someone to talk to. this all changed a few weeks ago when she told me she needed space. it was very difficult to go cold turkey, but i did my best. last night, she hurt herself pretty bad and had to go to the hospital. i, of course, was very worried about her and wanted to do something to help her feel better, so i dropped off her favorite candy at the door of her apartment. when she found out i did this, she was furious with me. she told me she's at wit's end with me i promised i wouldn't reach out to her again until she's ready.

obviously, i did something at some point to push her away like this. she can't handle me anymore for some reason. since i'm clearly oblivious, i'm scared i will accidentally do this to my remaining friends and push them away as well.

i don't know where to go from here. i've lost all passion and optimism for my life's dream and i'm too scared to reach out to my friends and family. the one thought that keeps returning to my mind is death. it would be so easy if i could slip away to sleep and have the pain be gone. but i can't do that to my friends and family. my cat, who is my best friend, has very bad anxiety and i am the only person he trusts. i could not go to sleep with the guilt of knowing that he would be alone.

so, we reach an impasse. i can't go on living like this. but i also can't hurt the people i love by ending it all. where do i go from here?"
"i can't do it anymore, i miss her too much","my wife of 19 years ended up cheating and filing for divorce.   she was the love of my life. and i did everything for her.., stood by her for 15 years of school no missing one semester,  graduated with her ba and then her masters.  she started her new career and made new friends,   totally changed her looks and personality  then broke my heart.   she didn't come home one night and then happened more and more and at the same time she filed for divorce.   she ripped my heart out.  i love her so much it's killing me inside knowing she's replaced me.  i can't function and i don't fucking care about anything anymore.   im 57 and she's 46.  i cant do it anymore.   fucking hurts too much.  she's so beautiful and she's not mine anymore.   how could she use me like she did.  i loved her so much...  i miss her so much i can't work , i've had to leave my work because my emotions take over and i can control them.  i just need the pain to end and i see no way out...  i just want to sleep and not wake.  i hate my life, she ruined me, she broke my heart...."
the boy i loved committed suicide ,"we both met in a psych ward in 2021. he was struggling with grief after his sister committed suicide. i was struggling with being sexually assaulted by a family friend. when we met, we immediately clicked. i celebrated his 22nd birthday with him in the facility. he was a halloween baby. 

we both shared such a special connection. always checking in on one another. he’d tell me things he didn’t tell anyone else. we’d agreed that we’d always be there for one another. 

well he committed suicide november 1st this year. just a day after his 25th birthday. 

i cared so much for him, never felt this way about anyone before. so much i never got to say. 

he tried to take his life before we met. he told me he failed and what he’d do different if he ever tried again. but he assured me he wouldn’t. said he had so much to live for. 

but now he’s gone. i’m broken. and i can’t imagine never seeing him or speaking to him again. i just want to die. 
"
going from suicidal to very happy all in the same day,"i feel so lonely because i've never found anyone else who feels the same way. i have depression and ever since the really really bad times i've never quite related to any other depressed person. for example fake smiling (never had to do that unless i was on the brink of tears at school) i genuinely felt happy but i was still depressed.

most of the times i think of suicide when a minor thing bothers me. like when a friend unconsciously leave me out i think of suicide and i start tearing because of suicidal thoughts. just minor things. i can be pretty genuinely happy beforehand but a minor thing happens and i'm emotionally unstable. or one day i can be sure i just want to die and the next i can feel like i'm on top of the world. i also mainly get depressed when i'm on my own and not with friends.

anyone else feel like that? or is it just me?

edit: didn't expect this to blow up. thanks for all the comments. i truly appreciate all of them. really!"
i finally did it.,"over the last long while i have been avoiding others and trying to ghost friends and family so i can just be nothing in peace.

it was taking too long so i decided to take a drastic but honestly liberating choice, i scared them off with insults, harassment and anything to make them hate me. some i felt awesome doing to, as they were just bad people to begin with, others i felt bad about but know it was better for them this way. 

there are a few i couldn't bring myself to hurt, they're just good people and their lives are already bad as is, they don't need to think they're disgusting, annoying, ugly, pathetic or anything of the sort. 

i burned all bridges with the publishers for my works because they were just an escape for me, i quit my job and now i'm here. happy. 

now, when it's 7 pm i'm in bed and when it's the morning i stay there. after a while of this i'm probably just going to go out my window. i seem like i'm boasting but really, i'm tired of this, i just couldn't keep up with social interactions or caring about my future or work or anything that a normal person should. now i want to stare into the ceiling, listen to music and have a break, then die when i'm done, does that make me crazy? does that make me crazy? possibly. all i remember is thinking i wanna be like them, crazy, gnarls barkley is an awesome song, i recommend it. i wonder what song i won't hear? they're all so fucking good. "
"""suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem""","i don't get it, it's a permanent solution which means you won't have any other problems. if it works it works, it's still a solution."
return to the desire to die ,"i had a great week with my boyfriend, it was good, it allowed me to be happy but now i'm back to my shitty life, suicidal thoughts coming back... the emotional elevator is too violent. i cry again and again... i want to die. i'm fed up that depression is always stronger, that happiness is so little present compared to sadness... i just want to kill myself"
i'm done trying to get better,"my whole life i've been trying and trying and trying and trying. i've gotten a bachelor's degree from a good school. i've gotten a career i thought would make me ""worthy"" of peoples attention. i've spent more than 10 years with various therapists, i attended retreats, support groups, workshops, tried many different hobbies, etc and etc. and nothing made me feel better. 

i dated a few people who made me feel utterly alone. they didn't actually like me for me but they were just afraid of being alone. i tried really hard to connect with people and form friendships, i was the one always reaching out and being the shoulder to cry on, the support system, yet i was forgotten and abandoned as soon as i needed help. 

my earliest childhood memory is ""oh i don't belong here"" and ever since i've been feeling like a blob in the universe. just floating around aimlessly, not knowing what the fuck to do with myself.

the only person i loved and cherished is gone - my grandma passed away in 2021. a few months after i attempted suicide but i survived. i wish i didn't. i really don't have any energy to keep going anymore. 

i'm going to end my life tonight and hopefully get to another realm. even if it's worse, at least it would be different. "
am i being selfish,"i have these thoughts of ending it whenever i feel down, i have so many great people in my life, why can’t i just be grateful for them and be happy. everyday is a battle with myself and everyday it’s exhausting"
can i give my organs to someone of i suicide?,"all my life i wished to give someone else my lifespan, the chance to live i was given. i dont wanna live my life i have not motivation not the energy to keep going i dont feel anything towards anyone just my gf but im hurting her i will prob break up with her before ending it ofc. im a waste and have wasted all my years i dont see the way through. drugs might do the thing to keep me going but its just miserable for me to just do them waiting to die and get it over with knowing i cant do it without them ( if you do drugs i dont have anything againts you). is there a way i can provide something out of my death? like donating my heart or any organ to give the chance to live to someone who  really wants to. i dont want to live and i choose that 

i atleast wanna make the best of it for someone that does.

good luck in life people"
not being able to kill myself because of others makes me want to kill myself,"they would be mortified, destroyed, scarred for life if i founded peace. my parents, my siblings, my friends, my therapist, the people in my class, anyone who saw me semi regularly. it would haunt the people i care about for the rest of their lives.

it’s so unfair. i just want out. i don’t like how life turned out. none of the promises made to me as a kid were true. i don’t want to struggle any more, i don’t want to barely drag myself through the simplest tasks of life for years to come. i don’t think i will ever be not depressed, this is just how i work. it’s not worth it.

it fills me with despair that the way out is just not an option, im too emphatic for that. i can’t put people through that, because i know what it will feel like, probably something close to how i feel a lot of the time. 

and that despair just makes the urge stronger."
my whole family pressures me to talk to my rapist uncle,i was raped and abused as a child by my uncle. after i posted here i got my mood up and told my mom about it and i'm planning to go to the police. but i also told one of my aunts. she then called my abuser and started pressuring me into talking with him and wanting me to don't sue him. i just want to die. he called me and texted me. i don't want to hear his voice again. what would it help to talk ??? it's not like he would admit to what he did. i just want to die. make it all end.
i dont know what´s happening with me.,"i just can't look ahead and see myself in the near future. it's like there's a big slime inside my own chest and i'm only going to be able to get it out by sacrificing myself. it's ridiculous, but honestly i just haven't tried to kill myself before because i don't know how to do it. i have no reason to hold on to absolutely anything."
alone,"so, a while ago i lost my friends after leaving a psychiatric center, as a result of a suicide attempt



since then i have felt very sad, it is difficult for me to do the things i like to distract myself, i wake up and the only thing i want is to anesthetize myself with marijuana



i started going to alcoholics anonymous, since before my hospitalization i had problems with alcohol



leaving the center, i felt happy. after many years, i managed to forgive those who had hurt me and above all i understood that i was hurting myself.



i started talking again to someone i cut contact with, everything was going well, he no longer responds to me, nor sees my messages, and it makes me feel lonely as shit



i want to cut ties, but it is very important to me, but at the same time it is exhausting to know that the other party is not on the same plane as you.



right now i feel empty, and more alone than ever, i really never thought i would fall into this abyss again after recovering my soul.



they took it from me from one moment to the next and i don't know what to do.



i don't want to wake up anymore, i don't want to feel, i don't want to suffer anymore



i'm thinking about taking my life this year, at some point i'll definitely do it, now i just have to continue surviving alone"
my life is slowly falling apart.,"i have nobody to talk to about these things, so i'm just texting it into the void online.

\- i lost my job due to lay-offs, i still haven't been able to find another job. this was a couple months ago. due to this, i've started rationing what i have in order to make it last.

\- my cars engine had a hole blown through it (it was an old car, so it was expected), the car i got after that completely died two days after purchase due to something that a previous owner had done to it, which the dealership was not aware of. the upside is that now i don't have to budget for insurance since i can't even afford buying a beater now.

\- my mother had to receive surgery around the holiday months, it was a pretty major surgery. during recovery she had to go back to the hospital a few times. she needed another surgery shortly after. as a result of the hospital employees' negligence, there were complications, and she is now permanently disabled. it was something as simple as a nurse not even bothering to check her medical records. i don't even want to ask her how far in debt she is, because i don't want to give the impression that i have any chance of helping with that.

this might not sound like a lot, but it's just what happened in the last month or two. i have tried to just suck it up, but i am nearing my end. no car? i just walk everywhere now, regardless of distance or weather. no income? i just ration what i have and hope it lasts. i've been dealing with this kind of luck for the past year. i'm getting tired of it, i have a constantly shrinking list of reasons to even care enough to stay alive. i've started staying up all night and just hoping i lose what's left on my list so i can finally end it. it's started negatively impacting my chances of even getting a job, because i come off incredibly off-putting in the few interviews i get. i can't pretend to love helping people when i'm just waiting for a reason to kill myself.

i'm sorry to whoever reads this if the formatting sucks, i don't use this site much. i think i'm just going to try falling asleep and hope i wake up better."
i work. i exercise. i eat healthy. i take my fucking meds. i still want to kill myself.,"i’ve done everything they say you should do.

i have a good job. i have a family. i have some friends. i eat healthy. i go to the fucking piece of shit gym everyday and i lift. i run until i can’t. i take stupid meds my psychiatrist gave me. i go to therapy(which is useless). in the end nothing has really changed. i am still alone. i feel a void in my life. i have no purpose and i don’t know why i’m here. i still want to die. 

why aren’t we allowed to kill ourselves? why do we have to feel guilty for wanting to die? fuck this life. 

i just want to blow my brains out."
"anyone else here ""suicidal but not suicidal""?","i'm suicidal, but not *suicidal.*

know what i mean?

in other words, i'm not ""suicidal""-suicidal.

know what i mean?

that's not to say i'm doing it for attention, though, either. (that's a common assumption/misconception). my pain is very real. my feelings of wanting to die are pretty genuine.

basically:

**i was just wondering if there was anyone else out there who, like me, has decided *not* to kill oneself—essentially, to continue living—despite the persistence of suicidal thoughts/feelings/ideations/wishes.**

i will not kill myself.

but some days, i really don't want to be alive anymore."
my wife attempted suicide,"wednesday afternoon my wife took a massive amount of medication. she texted me a photo of two piles of pills and said ""goodbye. i'm sorry."" i was at my parents apartment in the same building as ours, so i ran to our apartment, but she locked me out. i beat on the door over and over yelling for her to open up, and when she finally did, she just stumbled across the floor and fell on her bed, gagging and crying. i called 911 and held her head up and tried to keep her awake. she was vomiting everywhere. the paramedics carried her out of the apartment and down to a stretcher and i sped to the er right behind them. they gave me a number to call in the er to get updates, and all they kept saying was that she was in very critical condition and they're doing their best to stabilize her. she was vomiting so much that they couldn't pump her stomach and had to put her on a ventilator. hours went by that felt like days, and the dr finally called and said that they stabilized her, she was on a ventilator, but with the amount of duloxetine she ingested there was a high chance that she'd either be ""brain dead"" or have brain damage. i fell apart. my dad was there to hold me up, but i felt all the wind leave my lungs. my dad took the phone and talked to the dr some more and then he picked me up like i was a kid and got me out of there and into the car. he said there's nothing we can do here. she's in icu, she's gonna pull through, but we're waiting on the ct scan. so he drove us home, i passed out on the couch and at 6am the nurse called to tell us they got her off the ventilator and the scan was negative for brain damage. i threw my clothes on and sped to the hospital and stayed there for 2 days until it was time for her psychological evaluation. they actually said she was of no harm to herself or others and that she didn't require inpatient treatment of any kind. they discharged her to go home. i was speechless. i called her psychiatrist and he was emphatic about her being admitted for psychiatric treatment. she refused and said she just wanted to go home. now, we have 2 autistic children. i am on short term disability for a migraine that's been going since early may, every day, and i'm not responding to any treatment. my head's a 8/10 on the pain scale nearly every day. i'm seeing a neurologist tomorrow, finally, but i've been at home on bed rest since may 17th with an ice bag on my head. times are really tough. but now they want her to go home and for me to keep a ""suicide watch"" on her, to keep pills and sharp objects out of her reach. to find her outpatient therapy. to follow up with her psychiatrist and pcp. i can barely make myself a sandwich right now. so we brought her back home and the universe came calling. it was her psychiatrist who she's been seeing for 17 years. he said that if she doesn't follow his medical advice and admit herself to a mental health hospital, then he had no other recourse than to drop her as a patient. at that point, she got up, started getting herself together and said ok find me somewhere to go. i got her admitted to a reputable hospital that her psychiatrist recommended and i haven't heard from her since. i'm lost. i'm stuck between falling apart and angrier than i've ever been in my entire life. and my head is banging...just pounding. i asked my parents to take the kids until this blows over, and all i've been doing is crying, then i stop and get so mad...just furious. then i break down again. i talked to my therapist and my spiritual advisor and they both helped a lot. but i'm so, so broken. i'm so confused. what did i do to make this happen? i just cry myself to sleep wondering what she's doing and what i'm going to when she comes home. i've never been so scared of something in my life. what if she does this again? what about the kids? they're autistic, they don't understand the complexity of what's going down. what if they find something really wrong with my brain? i feel like i'm standing at the edge of a cliff in the middle of a wind storm, trying to keep my balance, trying to be strong, but knowing that sooner or later i'm going to fall. and everyone is depending on me. and for whatever reason, my wife, my best friend, the mother of my kids, after 14 years together just said ""goodbye. i'm sorry."" where the hell do we even go from here?"
i just survived a suicide attempt. and i just felt like i needed to say that to someone. (nsfw),"i actually went through with it. i chugged half a bottle of scotch and swallowed down a bottle of hydrocodone acetaminophen. it had been expired for 6 months- and though i kept it in a cool dry place since getting my wisdom teeth taken out, it must have gone bad because i’m still here. waking up from that was so disappointing. i’m still here- alive- and i seriously don’t want to be. but that’s life ha. 

anyway i can’t tell anyone about it. felt sick for hours and hours afterwards and just dealt with it alone. tried to call a friend but they ghosted. now what. people always tell me “oh you’ve been through so much you’re so strong you’re so resilient” i’m not trying to be resilient anymore i’m tired. i guess i’m either stupid enough to take bad pills or resilient enough to not die haha. i’ll just have to figure out what i’m supposed to do with my life now. 

i just think it’s wild that it didn’t work and that i’m fine."
do you guys fantasize about your suicide?,"i think about it a lot. like i imagine how it'll play out.

 who would find me, the mess it would make, how my apartment would likely smell of my decomposing corpse and how that would likely give away what actually happened. the process of distributing my stuff and the pain my father and boyfriend would be going through. my co workers finding out, how they would all act surprised and pretend they never saw this coming. 

do you guys go through the same thing?"
how do people not feel suicidal right now,"i could go out and tell a anyone that i would want to die and there’s a high chance that they would act like it’s 'not normal' and i need to get help etc etc. but how is it not normal to feel that way when the whole world is turning shit right now. the state of the world is making me feel so anxious. i feel unwelcome here, i’m not accepted by the people in this country even though i’ve lived here my whole life and feel at home here. it hurts my feelings. i want to feel safe and wanted somewhere but there’s no place like that for me"
"i’m 16, i want to kill myself. ","i can’t do this anymore, butbi dont have the balls to fucking end it. its an endless loop. i always fake feelings, always tell ppl i’m good and make ppl laugh. yk the phrase “does the jester laugh when he is alone” no he doesnt. i hate myself, my voice my interests my face my body i fucking hate it all. no one understands and never will. no girl will love me. i’ll die fucking alone and why not just do it now? i’m miserable, i can’t. i dont wanna keep living i just wanna die. i’ve felt this way for so long. i workpit as a cope but even then it gnaws at me. in school, talking to ppl, i hate it. one girlfriend i had ghosted me for another man, another tried to change the way i was for her own fucking delight like torvald and nora (a dolls house i love that play) i jusy hate everything. it may be hormones, depression, idk but all im is yhat for years i have wanted to put myself out of my misery. no one wld care, the world spins and ppl move on, so why not just kill myself now? im sorry for the rant."
"boyfriend, my only source of happiness, broke up with me. everything in my life is shattering.","i don’t have much to say but i was basically living with him. i was with him seven days a week and all day and night. everything reminds me of him. i continue to self-harm and this time last year i attempted suicide. i’m scared that my considerations of doing so again will become a reality this year. i cannot live without him, he was my only source of happiness and i cannot begin to distract myself. i’ve thrown up constantly and haven’t stopped crying. i spent my entire days and nights with him. my days are going to feel so long. there is no point in living. i have no purpose. i am literally a failure. i don’t know what i’m writing but there is so much more stress on top of just him. family, schooling, finances, etc. everything is falling apart. i hope this is the end."
"i feel fat, disgusting, annoying, and worthless - i do not want mental health help anymore i want to die","i think all of my annoying habits - being overly self-centered, self-conscious, overeater, does not take things seriously, vain, superficial, talkative, dramatic, gives up easily or sometimes too stubborn and does not let go, easily distracted, disorganized, extreme procrastinator, boy crazy

how am i 34 and my life is still this messy

no car, no career, live with parents, no significant other, no children

i am stupid enough to have a crush on a celibate catholic priest.

why can't i just die?

"
"just been notified that the cancer in my dad has spread and that he is about to die. i dont want to be an orphan. i lost my mom to cancer five years ago, my uncle in december 2020 and half my family is already dead. i cant. i will kill myself when he dies. tha pain is too much. not again.","in 2015 i lost my mom in a heartbreaking battle against leukemia and only refrained of killing myself, because my dad and friends were there. at the beginning of 2020 my dad started another cancer treatment over the course of several months, just after finishing one treatment before. after the treatment, the tumor was removed and he had other complications afterwards which were resolved over christmas. but he came back weakened and underweight from the hospital. then he we got infected with covid-19. today he was picked up by an ambulance, because he got weaker and weaker. when i spoke with the doctor over the phoned, he mentioned that the cancer has spread and that they can only stop its spreading even further - something my dad kept secret from me. it all makes sense now. he suddenly started buying me expensive presents, despite me not wanting them, stopped talking about next christmas and suddenly mentioning back up plans and so on. even the thought alone makes me want to rip out my heart, as the pain is paralysing my body and mind. i dont want to be alone. i no longer have friends. my aunt is old and sick aswell. my uncle just died of covid. why is everyone dying in my family. i cant anymore. my family is small and taken so fast.

this is it. when he dies i will kill myself as i am about to be alone and that thought freightens me. only my memories will remain of a happier time and even those a fading. maybe then i will see my mother again. maybe then we will be a happy family again. i am living in the past anyway."
just feel like it’s too much,"had suicidal ideation since i was like 13. it’s something always sitting in the back of the room of my mind. the last few years have been some of the hardest. ptsd and then betrayal trauma done something to my brain and i feel like i haven’t been able to experience positive emotions the same way since. on top of it i’m neurodivergent, have driving anxiety and social anxiety. i struggle to get a job due to it and the fact that i’m bedridden for several days a month from endometriosis. i’ve tried to make ends meet with my art on an etsy shop but it never gains enough traction or attention. i feel like a failure at 27 and a lot of the time this life doesn’t feel worth living. even if i know some of these struggles are due to the system we live in and how we are forced to live a certain way for survival of basic needs or we are left in the cold. i can’t shake feeling alone. worthless for not being able to be “normal”. how badly i wish i could escape this life. i just don’t feel like i’m meant to be here. 
also to mention i am in therapy but i guess just wanted to feel less alone or just get this off my chest. i’ve promised my partner i’d never take my life and do that to them but some days it’s so incredible hard. "
i think i'm going to kill myself after i graduate.,"been thinking about it for awhile. i want to get that done, at least, so i don't die a failure lol. i'm not going to lie, i'm just tired of being scared and sad. i'm tired of everything. becoming another statistic sucks but i don't know what else to do."
i want to die,i'm 15. i have a lovely girlfriend of 5 months and she's been so patient and loving and she makes me feel really special. but my past trauma just fucks everything up. it's like i have a tumor in my brain that tells me she hates me she wants to break up she doesn't love me and that i do t deserve it all from past relationship trauma. i was groomed and in an abusive rs when i was 12. i am 99% sure i have bipolar. my dad and you for do so that chance of me having it was always there but sometimes i get in what i think is manic episodes where things don't feel real i struggle to tell the different between dreams and real life my relationships are strained my thoughts run wild i can't sleep well and if i do my dreams is riddled with nightmares that i sometimes mistake for real life and absolutely nothing interests me at all im bored i feel worthless im anxious im depressed and i self harm. i just want out. ive expressed this to my gf im on meds ive talked to a dozen social workers i have my own therapist i went to inpatient treatment ive told my parents and friends and nothing works i dont want to be told it gets better or just give it time ive been on my meds for 4 months and previously was on a different med (both srri) for almost 2 years. i've been meeting with school social works for almost 2 years. i had one for a little over one year and one for the past for months. when the fuck does it get better. i have journaled i have turned to god i have done everything. the only reasons i dont want to go is my beautiful girlfriend but half the time i don't even feel like she loves me when she does i know she does she tells me she does she shows me she does but smth tells me she doesn't and my future i want to be a youtuber but that wont happen. i just wanna die.
finally time?,"i watched my mom kill herself when i was 7. men raped me on & off for months years earlier, around the ages of 5-6(?) 
ive had ect. i’ve been on meds for over a decade, and i’m only 25. nothing seems to get her out of my head. to get therapy i have to have money, to have enough money for therapy as a high school dropout i have to work full time. i can’t ever keep a job because of my mental (un)health. i want to get better. i believe i would be a good member of society. i have a huge heart. i can’t afford living, let alone treatment. suicide feels like the only option. i don’t even know if this is the right forum to post in lol bc ive relapsed and i’m shit faced. in case this is my last correspondence, i love you all and i am sorry. i love you, and life, so much. i just can’t afford to help myself. i love you."
i am trapped,"i am in an emotionally abusive marriage with no way out. after 20 years i am completely disheartened when i pick up and read my journals knowing nothing has changed in all that time. my journals have the same words year after year. 

the words i wrote on january 7, 2024 shocked me. they are the exact same words i would have written down on january 7, 2025. i chose not to write anymore. my words have no meaning. 

my prayers have gone completely unanswered. or is the answer just no?  or is god just a foolish dream? 

i work two jobs and still struggle with money and come home where there is no friend. it is a soulless existence. there is no escape from hell while i still breathe. 

my brokenness after 20 years is obviously not fixable. 

edit: i guess my post won’t be shown. it seems my words are unheard everywhere. oh well can’t say i’m surprised. "
i'm going to kill myself ,title says it all
