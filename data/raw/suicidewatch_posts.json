I’m lucky that I found the love of my life, but I just wish we could have gotten off on the same time line so we could be together longer. Once my husband is gone, I’m going to allow my animal babies to age/die naturally, then go to the Black Hills in South Dakota to a place where I’ll never be found. \nSince the age of 12, I knew I would end my life one day, but I wasn’t sure how or when. As I’ve gotten older it’s only cemented my plan further. I’m surprised I’ve lasted to 26 but that honestly thanks to my husband. Anyway, enough of my backstory and onto the real issue. \n\nI don't see my family often. I've tried to have relationships with my family members but they just aren't interest. I learn more about my family through social media than anything else. It doesn't bother me anymore that I don't see them, and quite frankly I don't believe it bothers them either. A part of me just wants to leave and make everyone think I disappeared or abandoned them, but then again I think it'll be selfish not to let anyone know. I believe it would be harder for them to accept my death, but if I disappear they will just be mad that I abandoned them. It's easier to live with anger than grief.",

    "selftext": "Clearly a throw away account since I dont want my friends or family seeing this.\n\nI am an 18 year old living in the states, previously working two jobs to live by myself to get away from my abusive family. It was by no means, a \"great\" life, but at the very least I was stable, I was doing normal everyday things as a normal everyday man, years of SH and suicidal thoughts later I was finally getting on the right track, I was this close to finally being \"happy\". And that was when it happened, I was hit by a distracted driver on his phone, he took off and I could find no street cameras in the area. I broke my leg and was hospitalized for a while which was enough for me to get fired from one of my jobs and have my hours cut on the other. I got into so much debt I had to go back to living with my brother, I am holding off on pulling the trigger because a co worker who was really nice to me had a family emergency and I am currently helping him out with his work for a while, but that is only until next week. My leg is recovering but I can tell my mental state is deteriorating by the day, I can not tell what is real and what isn't and I start to hallucinate at work, I would hear my old manager calling my name despite being alone, while cooking I would see everything spilling over only for it to be my imagination. Drinking no longer helps me escape, no matter how much I cut it doesn't get better, writing in this diary which used to help me with anger and sadness no longer does anything. I am honestly sick of it all. For now I am getting by but I'm gonna stick around for a couple more weeks because I still have some loose ends I need to tie up and make my decision then.\n\nThis is a diary entry from a couple weeks ago because if I do decide to not do it, I wanted atleast somebody to see it. Its not really meant for anybody in particular, some parts are directed towards certain people in my life but mostly it was for myself. I did include a bunch of references since I am a reader so if you notice something familiar then thats probably it.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\"I never asked to be born, I was forced to live, and live life I did. Yet things keep going wrong no matter what I do. \"Hang on\" they say, \"it gets better\" they say, when does it? Since 7 years ago, 2018, March 21st, it has not gotten better at all, it has all been downhill since. It didn't help that I was always alone. Back in that room, I was by myself, back in that classroom I was isolated, in that workplace everybody was a stranger. I was surrounded by people yet I was always alone, I cleaned my room and opened the windows, trying my best to find myself and yet I was still lost. I should have done this 7 years ago. 7 years and nothing has changed. 7 years, wasted.*\n\n*You may think I am selfish, but that's all I've ever been, selfish to my very core. With your helmet I was selfish, with all the shit I made you pay for I was selfish, everytime we ate something together I was selfish. And yet I, too was a human with dreams, with goals.*\n\n*I wanted to climb to the top of that mountain.*\n\n*I wanted to buy that Sony camera.*\n\n*I wanted to travel the country on my motorcycle.*\n\n*I too, wanted a normal, peaceful life.*\n\n*None of that will ever come true now though, so no point in dwelling in it.*\n\n\n*I want to say dont blame yourself, but I know you will anyway, the people around you might blame you aswell, I know that and I'm sorry. Some people are just really obsessed with pinning the blame on somebody, as if creating a scapegoat would make them all feel any better, but the only person to blame has always been myself.*\n\n\n*I do blame the fucker who hit me though, it was my fault, yes, I know, but are humans known as logical creatures? Nope, by creating this scapegoat of my very own, I can put all the blame on him, pretending that if I ever get to exact my revenge on him, it will all be okay, but we all know that isn't true, I just cant accept the fact that the fault is mine and mine alone. Who knew the consequences of my own actions could be so terrifying?*\n\n*But what was I supposed to do? What could I have done? What would YOU have done?*\n\n*Maybe I was wrong all alone and all of you are actually glad that the burden known as me, has finally been lifted from your shoulders. In that case, all the more reason for me to go on ahead and leave no regrets.*\n\n\n*But with this, my final action, I will have steered my life into the direction I want it to go for the first time in my life.*\n\n\n*Maybe in another life, I will be more fortunate.*\n\n*Peace.\"*",

A lot of my fear comes from my inability to read social cues.\n\nToday my best friend told me \"if you can't read social cues you're an asshole\" He essentially said if you ask for anything from anyone, that's applying social pressure and making it hard to say no.\n\nHe's autistic too. I don't fucking get it. I ask for consent for EVERYTHING (i don't have sex so it's all platonic) and if someone seems unsure I say \"it's okay if you're uncomfortable you don't have to/we can do something else. what do you prefer?\" \n\nbut apparently that's not enough because all along there were secret facial expressions and eye movements or some shit that i was missing and someone verbally stating their feelings will never be enough because people lie. and when they lie it's my fault because i have to fucking decode their secret puzzle, for some reason. \n\n i've been fighting for so long. This is the worst mental relapse i've ever had. It feels as if my body was covered in thousands of scars and that one conversation reopened all of them into a bloody vicious mess. I felt as if so many 'obsessions' were solved because I believed other people's boundaries were their responsibility. That's what all my other friends, my therapists (all 5 that i've had in my life) have told me, etc. but apparently it's not enough. i can't ever be enough. I can center my entire identity about caring about other people's boundaries and comfort and yet somehow i still fuck everything up because im just too retarded. \n\nWhat day should I kill myself? I'm thinking I'll give my therapy appointment on monday a shot and if he can't help them afterwards. Or maybe tuesday morning so i can watch the sunrise. idk. who cares. Maybe i'll just OD on my pills now. ",

I really with I had a gun or something easy as pulling a trigger to end me.\nI wanna travel but looking at my life... I don't think I could at all due to recent medical issues, and even if that not the problem, I'll still struggle financially to fund that hobby.\nI don't find joy in my hobbies that I usually do anymore and the food I like don't feel the same.

I don't want you to feel sympathy for me and cuddle me with kind words, I consider it humiliating and belittling. As a matter of fact, I want people who oppose and despise me. I hate when I'm expecting a certain reaction from somebody and they don't give me it. I don't believe that I'm insane or mentally ill in any way, and I know what's best for me. The reason I'm writing and posting this is because I just want some recognition and attention. I find joy in hurting people, especially the ones who love and care for me. Every time I have disappointed my mom and dad, it was on purpose, and I don't feel bad that I did it. I lie, decieve, steal, and manipulate not because I have to, but I just like doing it. I do go to extreme measures to get what I want, like threatening to kill myself if my parents kick me out, and this is just one example of all the crazy things I've done. Also, I don't plan on changing any time soon. If anything, I'm just getting worse. I'm really ungrateful, and I feel like the world owes me. If I had the choice to go to hell and take everyone else with me, then I'll gladly go. I don't believe that there's anything or anyone in this world that can change my mindset and my destructive behaviour. If I were to take half of the effort and stress I put in destroying my life towards bettering myself, I would probably be one of the most successful people in my age group. I do believe that I'm superior to others and would outsmart most people in many things, but I choose not to. I'm not afraid of anything. I'm not scared of stabbing myself or lighting myself on fire. I've been cutting and burning myself regularly for the past few months, not because I hate myself, but I just like the way it feels. There's no amount of physical pain that's worse than the pain I'm feeling inside. I was never about making friends or finding love. I've been thinking about and contemplating suicide for over two years now. I never made a decision that I regret and suicide is not any different. Meaning that I can guarantee myself that I won't regret it. If I ever commit suicide it's not because of depression or anxiety, it's for proving a point and to take revenge. I already got what I want from life. Thank you for your time.",

I'm getting PTSD from even having happy moments in life now because I'm just so used to that meaning everything is going to go back to shit and leave me more broken and with nothing. I have ADHD, autism, bipolar and schizophrenia. I'm also trans and live in the south. I've started to get extremely bad body dysmorphia and anxiety and paranoia. I had a job once but it was extremely taxing on my mental state. Workforce even said I was \"unemployable\" but I keep getting declined for disability. My mother is emotionally abusive to me and my father left on my 13th birthday. The only highlight in my life has been my wonderful girlfriend that is everything I could ever ask for. I try my best to be good for her and I try to put her needs before mine and I'm always highly emotionally supportive of her because she has a lot of trauma and needs it, but she just told me she doesn't really love me anymore and she just \"feels like she has to be with me\" because I don't have anywhere else to go or anyone else in my life. I feel like such a horrible burden and extreme guilt and sadness because I try so hard in every aspect and I know I'm hard to love too. She said I have till the end of February to get a job or she's kicking me out and then I'll be homeless. I honestly don't even know if it's worth trying. I've thought for awhile if I lose her like everyone else in my life I'd either throw my life away or just end it. I can't drive and there's not many places close by I can get a job at. Plus a lot of people speak Spanish here and I don't know any so I don't know why anyone would hire me. In addition the amount of stress and energy drain from work would put even more strain on my relationship that I don't even know is something that can be fixed. She says she still loves me, but I feel so emotionally neglected. To be fair, I suffer from childhood neglect so I need a lot of attention, but I feel like I'm not getting almost any. But, I imagine it's probably for her hard to give that support when or relationship is where it is. Idk I just hate how whenever it feels like maybe life finally might be about to actually change and be better it's just a fake out and the short joy filled parts are only there to keep me from getting numb to the pain and depression. I've never been someone to self harm, but over the past 4 months I constantly have been thinking about cutting, maiming, or just killing myself. I genuinely think I only make those around me miserable and only bring suffering to the world. I'm a waste of space and resources and nobody would really miss me at least for very long. After a few days they'd all realize how much better it is without me. I know a lot of the problems I have in life are because of me not others, but I can't do anything about it. I can't change, I can't try something different. All I seek is love and companionship, but whenever I get it they either leave or I'm cursed to watch them suffer trying to deal with me. I just don't see the point. I don't see a reason to continue. I don't think there is one. I was fucked from the start, it never mattered what I did. Nothing I can do or ever could do can change it. I just wish I didn't have a self preservation sense in my head. It would make doing what I need to do a lot easier. Instead I keep pointlessly trying to change and continue on. Hoping things will be better. That I might have a happy ending. It's not a fairy tale though, I don't get a happy ending. Instead I'm cursed to suffer for years and years hurting the ones I care about most. I just want it to stop. I want to know why this had to happen to me. Why I can't just have a good life without constant struggle and agony.",

Im 17 and have a hard time doing simple problem solving and have a hard time meeting new people and starting conversations. I’ve never been good at anything and to get good grades and learn any concept I have to work 2x as hard as anyone else. I’ve been seen as dumb my whole life and I kind of embraced that as a young kid in a sort of comedic way. I’ve always knew I was dumb and even had worries as a little kid about how that would affect my future, but I always thought “well i’m good with people so that will get me far” but as I got older I realized that as a kid my humor was just me being dumb and my lack of intelligence prevented me from starting and holding conversations. Im now a senior and all my piers are going to cool colleges, and though I have options they don’t satisfy me and don’t compare to others. I know I can work hard and get good grades but it won’t matter if i can’t retain any information. And most important I can’t make connections with new people. I have friends now but i’ve known them forever and even if you leave me one on one with any of them I can rarely  start or maintain a conversation, even those i’ve known for 13 years. I don’t think I’ll be able to get a significant other and obtain a job that will support a family. Taking all those things into consideration and the fact that i mumble, bad at sports, mediocre at things I love like video games, have no talent of any kind, perceive myself as ugly (even though i’ve been told girls find me attractive) I can’t believe it and can’t find confidence. The only thing that keeps me sane is my love of music and it’s not even like I play anything I just enjoy listening and finding new stuff, but what the fuck any good is that except keeping me happy for a tiny portion of time. I work out a lot but see lack of progress I think because of my genetics and the way I eat (even though i know people who work out less then me and eat worse) but yea… moral of the story is I hate my self and I think the only option is the kill myself. I always try to convince my self I am being dramatic and if I keep my feelings to myself and work hard at every aspect of my life it will get better but these thoughts keep coming back. The only thing that is stopping me from ending it is my family. I worry about my mom and I know it will destroy everyone else. It’s a painful feeling when you want to do something that will benefit you but will hurt people around you. Don’t know why i’m on here thinking it will fix anything but I would like some feedback. ",

Deep down (even if we pretend we don't care) I think when were close to carrying the act out we may want to gauge how our closest friends or family will react just for the fuck of it even if it means they find out and we don't go through with it. I'd like to think I'll be able to just fucking skip that step entirely I hope. Those of whom I've read about or know who killed themselves didn't make it known or just obvious. They just fucking did it. Some people do announce it, but it's all just fluff. In the grand scheme of things, if you announce it or talk about your plan it's really fucking meaningless in the end. You either do it, or you don't.\n\n\nI don't want to have \"Attempts\". If I'm gonna do it I'm gonna be fucking successful. Meanwhile the internet and media, even fucking literature as a whole treats information on using a good method like some kind of holy grail of taboo shit.\n\n\nI've always been fascinated with the \"Planning Phase\". Think of all the people who killed themselves that spent so many hours, if not DAYS, of constant thinking, constant planning, constant suffering, endless ideas and thoughts, so many doubts, so many nights spent running scenarios through their heads. Almost every night trapped in your own head. Ever since I read about and learned about other people who went through with it, I've always thought about the why and what exactly they went through leading up to it.\n\n\nNow I know it's unique to each and every one of us. And what I know for sure is that not a single person can understand any of that. Family nor friend, close or not close. Can be someone you'd die for. Doesn't mean a fucking thing. Those who kill themselves can never be understood. I don't give a shit what psychology claims or how \"close\" you can be with another person.\n\n\nSuicide transcends the closest of bonds and even modern psychology as a whole.

I'm 37 years old and I've been working towards a stable career since I was 18, and every time I specialize in something new, there is a recession or the market plummets for that career.\n\nI have a master's degree and 2 other degrees, experience in multiple professions, speak English and Spanish, three years experience as a software developer, got laid off twice, and I can't find a job. I've worked for many years, and this was supposed to be my time to finally at least live comfortably and be able to do things like buy a home and start a family. I've been to college for 11.5 years and have a ton of student loans, and can't get a job no matter what I do. I got laid off my decent paying job back in June because no clients wanted anyone without at least about 8 years of employed experience, and I got hired by another company in November and got laid off again 2 weeks ago because the company decided to combine tasks to one team and shrink the staff because it was slow. I've applied for over 250 jobs recently and not a single interview because they all only want the most experienced people that require no training or assistance.\n\nIn addition, I have autism, and the only people I've connected with mostly in the last decade are people who use that to their advantage to get things out of me and then blow me off afterwards. I was helping mentor and be like a parental figure to a friend's children who I really cared about, and after they got what they wanted out of me after claiming I was like a father to them for 5 years, they all the sudden weren't interested in seeing me anymore except for maybe when I was needed to help get them a job or a ride.\n\nI used to have a best friend and I haven't seen her in 9.5 years. She wasn't a friend, she was a best friend. Someone I told things to that I never told anyone else. After awhile, she started going through problems and taking them out on me, always losing jobs every week and saying it was someone else's fault, taking anxiety pills and antidepressants while loading up on alcohol, tried college but quit in the middle of the first semester because it was too hard, and eventually just chose not to talk to me at all anymore when I didn't validate her blaming everyone else for what she was going through.\n\nI also volunteered as a host parent for high school exchange students, and I had one really good kid from Thailand, but the rest were spoiled, entitled, blamed me for their problems, and eventually made up lies about me just so they can get a family with more luxuries like they pictured such as pools at their house, lots of space, etc.\n\nSo, what's really bothering me though, is everything I do succeed or catch a break at ends up being too good to be true. Friendships, jobs, other events in life always getting screwed up. Every time it appears I'm going to get to the next milestone in life, there is a market collapse, betrayed by someone sociopathic that I thought was my friend, etc.\n\nI honestly just wanna die and I'm planning it. I'm thinking around 3-4 months is my timeframe that I'll go to a hotel, bring a helium tank and make an exit bag, and then let some hotel employee find me after checkout time the next day.\n\nI've been in therapy for years, tried all sorts of medicine combinations, I don't drink or smoke, and nothing helps.

It’s not just the acne I have I also have bigger lips, which don’t sound bad but people talk abt it too much even my parents in the morning ask me if I put on lip plumper or if I’m having an allergic reaction. I’m not. Well back to the acne, it never got better I already went to the dermatologist and they have to tretnoin or smth and sm other stuff to use, I used it almost for a whole year and nothing changed my face looked as disgusting as it always was and is. Every where I go and every person I talk to including my Friends and family always ask if I ate smth wrong or if I am using to much stuff on my face, but then recommend stuff to use on my face. In middle school I see everyone have clear skin but they eat a lot of junk food and drink dunkin every day (I’m not hating) whenever I see someone doing that I wonder y their skin isn’t like mine and theirs is clear and beautiful. All my friends have clear skin so I feel different  when I’m with them. I bought loads of makeup to cover it up but it just makes it look worse and for the past 2 weeks my face has been itching and burning to the point where I can’t hold back my tears. I have already had thoughts of suicide before and tried to drown my self and burn but I freak out in the end so instead I just crack my fingers and scratch my skin until it bleeds. Today I also had thoughts of dying how there is no point of me living I don’t have any friends who I can talk to and express my feelings I try talking to my mom but I can’t tell anyone about my problems. I went to therapy but I didn’t tell them anything either. The world wouldn’t change if I weren’t here.",

Looking back, both my parents had un-diagnosed mental disorders as did both my siblings. My father was eventually diagnosed bi-polar. I had one suicide attempt at 15 that was a close call. I later joined the military and had one more close call with a firearm and another full attempt with pills. \n\nAround this time I started drinking heavily. The underlying depression stayed but acute thoughts of suicide went away. I also had some messed up experiences in the military, so, I continued drinking until a couple months ago. Complications of drinking almost killed me and I ended up in the hospital. I quit drinking but suicidal thoughts appeared immediately after I detoxed.  It's been going in waves of a couple hours or a day or two at a time. Not just hopelessness but deep nihilism. Such as feelings of, \"humanity is doomed\", \"we have maybe 5 years left, tops\". I have not felt this way before and I don't know what to do.",

Now I’m left with nothing. No friends, no education, no memories. Most of my life has been spent behind a screen, escaping reality. \n\nI’ve completely destroyed my image, I’ve lost countless friends and opportunities from my addiction not being able to be controlled.

When I was 10 years old a dentist pulled my upper premolars and retracted my face backwards, because of this I had issues breathing but I didn’t know what it was caused by. Fast forward 10 years and my dentist convinced me to extract all of my wisdom teeth (even though they grew in perfectly with no pain) and everything went downhill. I started to constantly shed hair, I developed sleep apnea, and my face changed horribly becoming way less defined and both jaws shifted backwards. I have become incredibly suicidal because of this and I barely even want to go outside and see people. Before you say it’s just facial dysmorphia or that I’m crazy, do some research because it is now common knowledge that extracting teeth can cause these things.\n\nI truly believe extracting teeth for no reason causes horrible mental and physical changes, at least it did for me. I don’t need a therapist or psychiatrist because it simply was never this bad before. I believe my wisdom teeth were making up for the lack of support from my premolars and now that they’re gone my face has collapsed. I seriously feel like there’s no point in living anymore now that I’ve developed these problems that both horribly affect my body and my self image, and I feel like I have had no control over my life because of these “professionals” who have only caused me harm.",

A 9-5 is not what humans are made for. \n\nThen people come at me and tell me that we should be grateful that we are getting paid and don’t have to work 16 hours a day or sth. Seriously?

It’s paradoxical. \n\nIn the end, even if you really want to work you’ll be aggressively challenged and have to compete against people who love the rat race.

I can't make thoughts. I'm a coward. I wish I could just go back in time and be younger again, I'm practically useless. I'm just one of those types of people who weigh down others. I dont like how I interact with people, I don't like how I present myself, I don't like how people see me. But I've accepted it. I will never live the life that I want. I've accepted it and I will do what I was ment to do. I'm going to put everything that has ever bothered me in a note. I've tried two times, and I'm not even going to act like a damn edge lord.

And I know my death with be a relief to every person I have ever loved or cared for as my existence has been whittled down to just receiving and giving pain. They will sigh and thank me for relieving them of the burden of having me in their life. The burden lifted off their shoulders.\n\nI truly ask,  what is the point of living in this cruel and heartless world any more?\n\n All I do is suffer and cause pain to anyone that comes into my life. I can't work or provide for myself. I am an emotional wreck and a dried up and useless husk of a person. I have lost the will to try, and I'm so tired of begging for help with no relief.\n\nI'm 34 years old with no family, friends, education, job, house or car.  I don't have and can't afford to have kids.  I have no ambition, and no way to improve myself or my life. I'm stuck. My existence now is only meant to serve others. I get taken advantage of, used, manipulated and lied to. And the men in my life only want to use my body for their sexual gratification. I have no soul and they don't care about my well-being or happiness. Just what I can offer them.\n\nI have nothing to fight for and I'm tired of wanting to be happy, aching to belong and to be understood and loved only to be abused and abandoned. \n\nWhat really solidified this choice is the people I love and care about most, they have shown me how little importance my life really has because they walked away no longer caring if I live or die. Showing me such coldness and neglect.  For god sake, my own abusive, belittling and demeaning family has even turned their back on me.\n\nIt's just too much.  Too painful. I cannot handle another 60 years of this half life, scared to leave my home, scared to talk to anyone because I'd just recieve pain and rejection. I'm scolded for feeling emotions, I'm scolded for loving others and wanting to be loved. I can't do or say anything right. I'm always doing something 'abusive' or 'unhealthy' with no one in my corner supporting me or encouraging me.\n\nI truly believe I have been cursed to walk this earth alone. And I'm not willing to do that.\n\nIt's been 34 years of misery, child abuse, neglect,  rejection, pain and embarrasment. And no amount of hospital visits, therapy sessions or medications can ever 'fix' or 'fill' this enormous void I feel inside myself. That in fact, I have always felt.  I've run out of patience, time or care.\n\nI want peace. I want this unbareble pain to stop. I want the nightmares and ptsd memories to stop. And I want to be able to choose when and how I go out.\n\nI've tried everything to love myself and to get better and be better but I just don't think that's possible for me any more unfortunately.",

People are out there drinking and smoking and getting addicted and beat and are cutting themselves and I’m being petty about my strict parents and the fucking asses of people around me. Do people even see how shitty these students are? They make fun of everything that isn’t to their standards. I saw kids my age and younger vaping in the locker room because we didn’t have a female teacher to spy on them. And they have conversations of using other people and then dumping them or leaving them instantly. And then I think “is my life that shitty? Or am I over reacting.” Why does everything in my life feel so fucking shitty. Im a shitty friend too. I say yes to everything even though I really don’t want to do something specific. When is it too much? How much should I do? And why do I care so much? And just imagine how easy it would be to kill everyone.

Almost 14 hrs after it happened. I had flu like symptoms earlier and they thought that had progressed into something which made me that way. I was taken to the ER. I dont remember much but I had not told the doctors or anyone I had overdosed. I was found positive for strep, prescribed meds and sent home. After that I had mild pain in my abdomen on both sides and on the back as well. The pain has slowly increased the past 1 week and I would say it is moderate now and I feel the pain even when walking or when I am in a seated position.\n\nDo I need to get this checked out?

    "selftext": "From the outside, I have a pretty nice life. I had a great childhood with a loving family and I'm surrounded by great friends. Despite this, I can't shake the feeling that I'll never be happy.\n\nMy whole life I grew up with the dream of working in the film industry and making movies. I thought from a young age that because I was so dedicated and put so much effort into this dream that my passion could carry me. I thought that if you believed in yourself, anything was possible.\n\nMy first wake up call was when I only got into my last two choices of the six universities I applied to. The rejection hurt, but I was still optimistic and hoped I could get a great education. When I started school, I immediately felt like an outsider. I was a shy, sober kid at one of the country's top party schools. I felt alone. I isolated myself because I didn't want to give into the frat party lifestyle and just wanted to focus on my degree and making movies. During my sophomore year, I found a small group of friends and started hanging out with them...until COVID struck that semester. I spent two of my last four semesters at home, and one of those semesters on campus social hang outs were strictly prohibited. By the time I graduated, that group of people were still the closest friends I had on campus, but were far from feeling like \"close friends.\"\n\nUpon graduating, I wasn't able to find a job in the film industry. This was frustrating, but it allowed me to move home and save up money for a little while. I was never able to secure a job in the industry, so I got desperate and got an entry-level job with a big corporation in the entertainment industry, however not in the field I wanted. I didn't mind this, I saw it as a way to get my foot in the door with this company and hopefully move to something more career-relevant in a short period of time.\n\nTwo and a half years have gone by. To date, I have applied for 72 jobs with this company that are closer to the career I studied for, have personal experience in, and have spent my whole life wanting to work in. I have not attained an interview for a single one of these jobs. Outside of this company, I've applied for film-related entry level jobs at small companies and big companies, all with the same result -- no one is interested.\n\nI've lost the passion I once had for this field. I used to spend all my free time on personal projects to build my portfolio, but what's the point now? I'm a failure. It came to a head last fall when I checked myself into a hospital because I had become overwhelmed by suicidal thoughts. I went in with the hope of trying to talk to someone about my feelings and seeking guidance and what I got was feeling like I was put in prison where they could test medications on me (medications which, as I would learn over the coming months, only made me feel worse). I left the hospital after a couple days, and two weeks later my girlfriend broke up with me because my mental health was too draining on her. I don't blame her, but it certainly wasn't good timing for me.\n\nMy girlfriend was my best friend and the one person I could trust to be there for me over the past year and a half (even before we started dating). We stayed friends after breaking up and I appreciated her for still allowing me to confide in her when I needed someone to talk to. This all changed a few weeks ago when she told me she needed space. It was very difficult to go cold turkey, but I did my best. Last night, she hurt herself pretty bad and had to go to the hospital. I, of course, was very worried about her and wanted to do something to help her feel better, so I dropped off her favorite candy at the door of her apartment. When she found out I did this, she was furious with me. She told me she's at wit's end with me I promised I wouldn't reach out to her again until she's ready.\n\nObviously, I did something at some point to push her away like this. She can't handle me anymore for some reason. Since I'm clearly oblivious, I'm scared I will accidentally do this to my remaining friends and push them away as well.\n\nI don't know where to go from here. I've lost all passion and optimism for my life's dream and I'm too scared to reach out to my friends and family. The one thought that keeps returning to my mind is death. It would be so easy if I could slip away to sleep and have the pain be gone. But I can't do that to my friends and family. My cat, who is my best friend, has very bad anxiety and I am the only person he trusts. I could not go to sleep with the guilt of knowing that he would be alone.\n\nSo, we reach an impasse. I can't go on living like this. But I also can't hurt the people I love by ending it all. Where do I go from here?",

The thought of it itself is enough to make me choke up and become unable to speak. My boss knows I have ‘some anxiety’ with this. That being said, I had a presentation coming up and when speaking to my boss about it, I suddenly couldn’t control my voice or emotions and had to have a cry. I am extremely embarrassed but am hoping to move past it and not have it mentioned again. I’m trying to look for a new job now but the market is discouraging (shocker). I’m just becoming hopeless that I will never be able to succeed in life. Thinking of how much life costs and how much I will need to make to support myself for the rest of my life frightens me. I always come back to the answer that I didn’t ask to be here. I was put here by my parents with no choice of my own. I don’t want to be here and continue to feel so down about the person I turned out to be. I’m an embarrassment. I feel worthless most of the time because I know I will never amount to anything like my sisters or others around me who seem to have no trouble finding their passion and succeeding in their careers. I don’t care to have children, god knows I couldn’t afford them if I tried. I don’t have a purpose. What’s the point of anything? You get put on this earth with no choice. You have to work even if you are inadequate and are forced to struggle with money for life. It’s all about money always. You need food, shelter, clothes, as basic necessities for life. It will never not be about money. I hope death isn’t as costly, for my family at least. I don’t know what else I’m saying. I just needed it get it out somewhere.  ",

Either due to failure and my inability to find a competent alternative, or simple inactivity. When I fuck up on one thing, I sort of obsess over fixing it and I ignore everything else. \n* No matter how hard I try, I don’t amount to anything. My existence or presence is NEVER enough! Kindness and sense of humor is not enough for good relationships:\n    * My interpersonal, logical and even emotional intelligence is in a very poor state. I end up portraying the funny (and I’m barely that), but idiotic buff guy or the hard, vapid and shy dude in my friend groups. Idk if I’m on the spectrum or just have social anxiety & general awkwardness. Not to mention, I’m not very innovative or astute. \n    * I’m look much to look at. I don’t have pretty eyes, nice hair, a good sense of style or masculine charm at all. I’m 6’2, deep-voiced and muscular but overweight. (Even with all of my dieting and exercise, I can’t escape being that fat, ugly kid with a constant chip on his shoulder) I’ve A LOT on not being bitter, it’s poisonous. Although, there’s still a good dose of edginess that’s still curdling. My resentful, vindictive and determined, yet brutal thoughts are a testament to it. That’s why I try to keep it in control, because I’m scared of that fragment of me.\n    * Confidence is a concept that I’ve never fully grasped. My athletic ability, intelligence and personality have never been things that I can count on. Sure, I can feign confidence  and I’m exactly afraid of making mistakes…but I’m afraid of making myself look weak or trash at things. Do you know how many times a day that I think about building upon my interest or even ask more girls for her number, but never could because I’m a fucking pussy?? Finally, it’s began to fuck with my identity. I’ve started to paint the persona or me that’s “interesting” and “unique”. Let me just say it now: I’m not this Caribbean dude with this interesting story on how I got here, I’m just a regular black guy from the Midwest. There I said it! \n    * Never had an actual GF. I’m not a virgin but I haven’t experienced any form of strong intimacy in a VERY long time. Where somebody understands and trusts me as I do them. You know? As I list all of these things, no wonder nobody wants to date me. I’m not confident, super disciplined, ambitious or assertive (I stand up for others but rarely for myself). Nothing about me is manly or worthy.\n    * Lastly, I basically fucked up my future because I was too weak to adjust to My overall grades are DEFINITELY not graduate school quality. To think that my cretinous-ass could be a neuropsychologist. Plus, my parents think that I’m graduating this semester. I just told them that to ease their minds from their funds.At the moment, there’s no future in sight that I want to experience. \n\n“Listen, I’m going to give my ABSOLUTE BEST attempt at achieving something significant in this life, but if I’m unsuccessful…December 31st, 2025 will be my last day with all of you. I’ll write out the goodbyes, the apologies and that’ll be it. Remember when I told you that I don’t break promises, well I made this promise to myself at 18 and I intent to keep my streak!

If it wasn't for the health issues we both know this would just be about a breakup and I would go on with life. I was planning to go out in a way that would every little impact on the adult children, alone in a hospital car park so no family members would find the first to find me.

He says it will fuck him a bit but knowing he was there for me at the end will give him peace.\nWhat would be the correct path to take?\nI can't call for medical professional help as this could bring the question of whether I was in the my right mind when I made my will and other changes, so this is the best I can think of.",

She's very irrated after work and she works almost everyday so I get yelled at and shit at when the house isn't clean or something. But mama listens to my cries because she sees that I'm struggling mentally, but she's never sent me to a therapist because she tried to \"fix\" me herself. (she's a psychologist.) She is a total sweetheart and an amazing mother, but when she's pissed, she drops very hurtful things. She always says I'm like my dad. Last time she said that I broke down crying, saying \"I don't want to be like him\" and she just said \"then don't be.\" which didn't make it ANY better.. :/ but, me and her had many deep and sad talks. I once asked her \"why didn't you leave?\" and she was like \"because he wasn't like this back then and now I can't leave because.. what kind of shit move is it to leave the guy that cared for you so many years, right as his health starts to get worse?\" I just looked down and nodded, saying that I get what she is saying, because I do get it. \n\nTo my siblings.. They are complicated. They treat me like dirt but they love me. One of my little sisters, \"I\", always tells everyone irl that she loves me and that I'm her favorite sister but at home she puts me down. probably because she sees that dad gives her praise, but oh well, what do I know? and yeah, the youngest, \"C\", just purely and truly hates me but also loves me sometimes. everytime she does some shit, she puts the fault on me and they believe her which pmo so bad sometimes. but do I put up a fight? hell no. and well, my older brother, \"A\" is.. scary. when we were little we were best friends and hung out together. but now he hates me. I don't even think he remembers the shit he's done to me. I remember so vividly the one time he tried to f*ck me. Yes, f*ck me. He was like.. 13? and I was 10. he wanted to stick it in till he heard our parents car pull into the driveway. I thank god that nothing happened that day. I don't hate my brother, I just find him weird. he hates me but he doesn't? I don't know. I feel uncomfortable around him most of the time. But.. yeah.\n\nand now to.. my baby, my everything, \"K\". Kevin has been my boyfriend for two months now and he's heard about the shit I'm going through. he wants me to go to the police the whole time because my dad sometimes still tends to be abusive but my heart can't handle sending a cancer sick diabetic old man in jail for treating me like shit for years. He's a huge prick but he's my father and somewhere I still love him even though I want him dead sometimes. But, \"K\" has been there for me in every single situation, trying to make me feel better and to cheer me up, he's the best boyfriend a girl could ask for, like.. seriously.\n\nThis is a long ass fucking vent and I'm so sorry to anyone who's reading this but I just can't anymore. \n\nI want to stay alive but these thoughts and voices are getting louder everyday. I have a lot of reasons to live, \"M\", \"L\", my mom, my boyfriend, \"K\". but I feel like they are getting tired of me. it's the same shit everyday. I'm happy, I lose energy and ignore them because I'm crying or slitting my fucking wrist like a fucking selfish bastard. I promised mama so many times that I'm going to stop but I can't. I seriously cut to feel something else than this crippling sadness. the sudden bursts of energy and happiness make me insane, I don't want to he happy for few minutes/hours, I want to be happy for a few days, weeks, maybe even months! but I guess that's too much to ask. \n\nI'm sorry for venting. I'm sorry if this is TMI. But I don't want to keep on living, not even for my favorite people, I'm just fucking tired. Sorry.\n",

I just want to rest and no one allows it now, I feel guilty resting, am I doomed to be stuck in this loop forever, why is the world so tiring?\n\nMy partner is mad at me for spending, but I spend for the house, the only thing I got myself was the Nintendo, some clothes, and now a hair dryer. Years and years I barely have new clothes, only thrift or hand me downs. I buy cheap clothes. My friend was even shocked I got brand new clothes. \n\nHe’s mad at his company for firing him. He’s mad at himself for being a loser and idk how to comfort him cuz I feel the same way. \n\nI’m staring at the window from the 14th floor. I want to cry but there’s no tears. Fuck this, I’m tired. I have been on survival mode for so long, I just want to be spoon fed some miracle at this point, not fighting for it. \n\nBut I’m a mother, a partner, a worker, and many others.

    "selftext": "Forever feeling like a temporary fixture in everyone’s life. I unfortunately have never had a significant relationship or legitimate friendship last longer than maybe 2 years? And that’s being generous considering the fact they’re usually on and off again types. Even family members who I would see every single week and spend every holiday with when I was growing up, I haven’t seen in years. It’s getting to a point where my own sisters don’t want to spend time with me. As my mother so lovingly points out it’s because I can be absent sometimes. I have a bad habit of making plans one day then when the time comes I either just don’t have the energy or I just want to be alone. I had one of the worst episodes I’ve had in a while last night. I haven’t been diagnosed BPD but it’s fucking clear I have it. I literally went from hyperventilating crying to being completely numb and expressionless as soon as I pulled in my neighborhood. The past 2 and a half years has had so many fucking ups and downs. Feels like more has happened in that time than what’s happened in my whole life smh. I’ve lost so many friendships, I’ve been in 3 serious relationships, I totaled my car, was without a job twice just in the past 7 months. I know my alcohol and drug use has for sure increased. I’m overweight, out of shape, in the worst physical condition I’ve ever been in. I need help. I know I do. I’ve always fucking known it. I’m scared shitless to take that first step though. I honestly have been wanting to commit myself to a long term care program or a rehab facility but I am so worried everything will be more fucked when/if I ever got out. I obviously wouldn’t be working how the fuck would I pay my bills??? Savings?? Lmao yeah right. My addictions are more than just lil white baggies. I spend sooooooo much fucking money I have no idea how it happens. I swear I can spend over a grand and then not even remember what I bought. It isn’t even as bad as it used to be if you can believe it. I have so many problems I don’t know where to fucking start. Do I start with my deeply rooted mommy issues, my undiagnosed mental illness(es), my drug and alcohol abuse, my financial problems, or my obesity issues. Luckily I have a roof over my head or I’d already be dead. This is honestly why I force myself to not care about anything anymore. My  brain and my heart are going in 10000 different directions and 20 million different speeds, it’s easier to just think about giving up. But obviously there is something that won’t let me fully give in. It’s like the “want/need” to kill myself is always there but when I take the knife to my wrist or drive to the lake, I physically can’t do it. But at the same time the pain I cause myself or the people around me feels like killing myself would be kinder. ",

I have one day a month usually where I’m able to just have a normal day with normal little issues. The rest is filled with every single hour occupying what would ruin someones day, week or even month. Huge monumental, unsolvable problems that were not caused and can not be fixed by me. So I just get fucked. I absolutely am without a doubt cursed, and am meant to suffer for whatever reason. My life is essentially that typical episode every sitcom has where a main character experiences a groundhog day where they keep dying or everything’s after them and the universe is just against them. Doesn’t matter how hyper aware, relaxed, hard working, lazy, out going, homebody, where-ever I am and no matter what I do, constant problems. Its driven me to the brink of insanity, and I will absolutely snap soon and just drive my car into a pole as fast as possible. Theres no solution either, just suffer until I break. I fucking despise life, and no, I am not grateful or blessed, I am cursed to live a life not worth living and I don’t have the strength to kill myself, tried in the past but failed. I am 25 years old, and I have already experienced almost every single possible worst thing a human can ever experience in their life, I mention my age because I know it’s going to get worse as life goes on and I’m sure I won’t have the luck to be able to be taken out by natural causes early, so unless I kill myself I’m just going to suffer indefinitely. No things are not going to get better, they never have, and never will. As mentioned before, my place in life whether it be financially, emotionally or whatever situationally doesnt matter. Problems just never cease, only grow and get worse. So yeah, fuck my life and I hope I die today. ",

    "selftext": "I don’t really know how to start this. The very act of trying to find the words feels too overwhelming, as if just making the effort is too much to bear. But every day, it scares me—this constant regret of all the things I never said, now lost forever, drifting away with every passing moment. I don’t know if I can make this right, but maybe I should at least try, just once. Maybe trying is the only way to find peace in all of this.\n\nIt’s taken me so long to even begin, let alone continue. Every day, I’ve watched myself avoid these feelings, these unsaid words. I’ve paused too many times writing, made too many excuses just to run away from the pain, from the truth that I need to do this—not just for you, but maybe for myself also. I can’t keep hiding from what I owe, to both you and me. It’s been hard, getting here, facing everything I’ve tried to avoid. But somehow, it feels right, in a way. To let myself be vulnerable again, to open this wound I created and tried to hide for so long. Maybe it’s not about healing—it’s about learning to live with what happened. Maybe this time, I can finally let myself face the truth without running.\n\nMy room feels darker than it truly is, lit only by the faint, flickering glow of my monitors. The hour has long passed, its midnight, and the cold has begun to run into my skin, going deep into my body as the night passes. I’m growing used to this feeling again—the routine of doing nothing, just sitting here, staring at these screens as if they hold the answer to the emptiness I’m trying to outrun. I’ve called off the search for my soul, I put them on hold again, telling myself its impossible, when in truth, I know I’ve just given up on finding it.\n\nI feed myself with endless distractions, each one a momentary attempt to numb the pain inside, a way to escape the weight of what lingers beneath. They offer temporary relief—small bursts of satisfaction that fade almost as quickly as they arrive, leaving me empty again, like an empty room that refuses to be filled. And yet, I keep chasing them, as if one might finally make me forget, might silence these thoughts that has been creeping me, ones that burn like a fever, searing through me as if I’m burning alive. Thoughts about what’s really happening. Thoughts about what’s already happened.\n\nThe silence around me feels heavy, pressing down harder with every passing moment. It’s the kind of silence that amplifies everything I’m trying to escape. And though I know this cycle leads nowhere, I let it continue, because facing the truth feels harder than this endless loop of distractions.\n\nIt’s so late, isn’t it? I’ve lost track of time, but somehow, that doesn’t seem to matter anymore. The hours slip away without me even noticing. I feel like I’m drifting, lost, floating through these moments with no real direction. I wake up thinking of you, and when I fall asleep, it’s the same—your presence lingers in my mind, always there. Every thought is haunted by you, even when I try to push it away, as if you’re woven into the very fabric of my consciousness. How is it now that somehow you’re a stranger, but you were mine just yesterday? I don’t know how we got here, but it feels so different now. Everything has shifted, and I find myself standing in this strange, unfamiliar space, trying to remember what we once had. I don’t know what I’m doing. I don’t know how I ended up here, in this place of endless questioning. All I know is that somewhere, in the middle of all this confusion, I failed. I lost. And that’s the hardest part: admitting it to myself. It feels like the truth is something I can’t outrun, something I can’t hide from anymore, no matter how hard I try. It sits with me, heavy and undeniable. I’m afraid to say it aloud, but deep down, I know it’s true. I’ve failed, and I don’t know how to fix it. It feels too late, doesn’t it? Too late for anything to be what it should have been. Did I crossed the line?\n\nI don’t blame you. You can’t save me. No one can, but myself. You were trying your best, trying to fill the gaps in the empty void within me. And I can’t imagine how much that must have taken from you. I see it now, in everything we’ve become. I mean, look at where we are now.\n\nYou took charge of something you were never supposed to, and that wasn’t fair to you. You’re just human, a precious being with your own emptiness to handle. I treated you like an extension of me, like something that could make me feel alive again, and that feels so wrong. It feels like I forced you to carry a burden that wasn’t yours to bear. And I hate myself for making you feel like that, for making you believe you were a failure, that you weren’t enough, that you were just a decoration. You were trying to fix something that was never meant to be fixed, because it wasn’t meant to be fixed by anyone else in the first place. It was my brokenness, my weight, and I made it yours.\n\nIt all makes sense now, doesn’t it? The way we fell apart, how the silence between us grew, how the distance stretched until it became an insurmountable divide. I should have let you be who you were, not something I could cling to in order to make myself feel whole. But now, in the quiet of these empty moments, I finally see that. I realize I failed to understand you, failed to see that you were struggling just like me—that you too got tired, got angry, became anxious, and overthought everything. I was too caught up in my own mind to truly listen to yours, and now I’m left wondering if I could have done something differently.\n\nCould we have still been something, if I hadn’t acted the way I did? If I had been more patient, less selfish, maybe more understanding of your own battles? Or was this always the way it was meant to unfold? I keep asking myself these questions, replaying them over and over in my mind, but all I’m left with are doubts and regret. And the memories—always the memories—is the only thing that remains, the only thing that still holds the weight of what once was. It reminds me of everything I’ve lost, of every chance I took for granted. It's the only constant in this aftermath, the only piece of you that I can still hold on to. But even that feels like it's slipping away, like everything else I’ve lost in the wake of it all.\n\nAnd now, my room feels emptier, in a way that’s hard to explain. It’s always been empty, but now, it’s as if something I once had here is gone. I don’t know what it is—it’s like a ghost, or maybe a memory, a presence that was here, but now it’s simply vanished. It started to fade months ago, little by little, like sunlight dimming behind thick clouds, the sky growing heavy, the clouds turning darker, and a storm quietly gathering on the horizon. And now, it’s completely gone. It’s like the feeling of you, of us, slipping through my fingers, like trying to hold onto sand that falls no matter how tightly I grip. I reach for it in the air, hoping some trace will remain, but it slips away, dissolving before I even understand what I’m losing. The air feels heavier, quieter, as if it’s closing in on me. Every small sound echoes longer in the silence, reminding me of how empty everything has become. I try to fill it with something—anything—but nothing stays. It feels like the silence itself is swallowing everything whole, taking everything with it. And yet, it’s not just the room. It’s me. I can feel myself emptying, piece by piece, the weight of missing you pulling everything else away, leaving only a fragment of me. I don’t know how to stop it, or if I even can.\n\nI started doing things again—old habits I had forgotten about, things that used to come naturally. They all welcomed me back, as if they had been waiting for me, patiently holding space for my return. But there’s something off about it, something unsettling. I feel dissociated by these welcomes, like I’ve been pulled back here because I’ve done something wrong, something I can’t quite put my finger on. It’s strange to be in this place again, doing things I once did without a second thought. It feels familiar, but also foreign, like I don’t belong here anymore. I keep wondering if I missed something, if I did something wrong, if all of this—this emptiness, this disconnect—is somehow my fault. The thought lingers, heavy in the back of my mind, like a question I can’t answer but can’t stop asking.\n\nThe music means so much more to me now. It speaks in ways I never paid attention to before. It’s like you gave me a warning, a foreshadowing I couldn’t hear then. You planted those seeds, and now, I remember the songs we shared—the ones I used to listen to without thinking deeper. Now, they tell me everything. They hold meanings I was too blind to see, messages I should have heard before but didn’t. It’s like each note carries the weight of everything unsaid, the beauty of your subtleties and unspoken truth. It’s as though I can hear the echoes of your soul in every song, the way our hearts are quietly pierced through by something from the melody of our past, leaving a wound that never fully heals—a cut that always bleeds.\n\nI didn’t pay attention to the lyrics back then, the subtle words you left me, the quiet signs you showed me. You were tired, weren’t you? You told me more than I ever realized—through your words, through your actions, through everything. But I only focused on the beat, on the sound, on the noise. I was so caught up in my emotions, my insecurities, and my own self-centeredness. I didn’t see what you were trying to say, not fully. And now, those lyrics have become truths I can’t ignore. They haunt with your pain, your weariness, and the love you tried so hard to hold on. It’s a love that I only now realize was never truly mine to claim, yet it was a gift I could have treasured. And in my ignorance, they all faded away.\n\nSometimes, I sit and wonder what it must have felt like for you—to carry that weight alone, to leave quiet signs in the hope that I’d notice, only to see me stumble blindly past them. Now, carrying the heavy longing in my arms, I feel the weight of everything I didn’t see, everything I didn’t understand. It feels heavier than I ever thought possible, pressing down on me with the realization of what you must have endured. I didn’t know that I had it all, and nobody warned me before the fall. And I’m wasted. I wish you didn’t leave, I just needed a wake-up call. And now I’m facing the greatest loss of them all.\n\nBut trying to see from both perspectives, I understand the gravity of everything. I realize how beautiful things were, how beautiful they could’ve been, for both of us. The moments we shared, the connection we had, everything—so much of it was real. But it feels like too much time has passed. Too much has been lost for it to ever be what it should have been.\n\nWhat if I had understood then, had seen the depth of your silent struggles? Could I have done something differently? Could I have spared myself from this weight of regret? It’s a question I will never know the answer to, a path that has disappeared behind me, a place lost in time—where I once saw you, where you, my loved one, stayed. to a place I can no longer go back to.\n\nAnd I just find myself crying without warning—no reason, just tears. It’s the music. The songs we both listened to, or the ones you played. I can’t help it—they pull me back, tugging at threads I thought I had buried. They bring up everything: the memories, the moments, the pain, the love. Each note feels like a doorway, opening to a place where I still thought there was time, where we still believed that what we had could last. It’s like the music keeps us alive, even when you’re not here anymore. And In some moments, I think of you when I am sad and down, when the silence makes me cry, when it’s hard to try, and all I can do is simply fall back into you. Those songs remind me of the pieces of us still scattered in the corners of my heart, and I can’t help but let myself be pulled into them, pulled back to you.\n\nI’ve placed so many emotions in the lyrics of the songs we listened to, each one wrapped in memories that refuses to fade. The regret, the longing, the guilt—they all live in those songs now, stitched into every melody. They’ve become a part of me, just as you are. And when I hear them, it feels like I’m hearing you again, like your voice is hiding between the chords, calling me back to something I’ll never touch again. A glimpse of us—not the us we are now, the one distant and separated by time. The us from before, when everything felt possible. When everything felt more safer, and the world was full of promise, and we could pretend that nothing could ever tear us apart. That version of us feels more closer when the music plays, as if I could be there again, if only I could reach far enough, but the distance between now and then is too vast, too final. The past, once vivid, is fading into a place I can’t revisit, a place where you still held my hand and we still believed in something worthwhile. A place where no storm could break us, that time would be kind to us. But now, all that’s left are fragments, memories wrapped in a melancholic tone that plays on, reminding me of who we were—of who I thought we’d always be. And every note brings me back, just for a moment, before reality pulls me further away, leaving me with nothing but the silence after the song ends.\n\nI wish I could go back, even for just a moment, to hear you sing those songs again, to feel the way your voice carried emotions I never fully understood—how every note told a story, every lyric a piece of your soul. We were doing nothing, yet it felt like everything, as if our souls were trying to speak to each other without a single word. I long to see us again, together, lost in the music, wrapped in the warmth of the moment, before everything began to slip away.\n\nI cherish what we had, even though it hurts, and the weight of it sometimes feels unbearable. I relive the good moments over and over, clinging to them like lifelines, but they only make the ache sharper. I fight the guilt that always seems to follow me—the regret of what I did, what I didn’t do, and all the ways I fell short. It’s a battle I’m slowly losing, as if every memory chips away at me, piece by piece.\n\nI hate myself for how it ended. I hate myself for the words left unsaid and the ones I shouldn’t have spoken. For the times I let you down when all I wanted was to hold us together. I miss you so much that some days it feels impossible to breathe, like the world is caving in around me. Knowing I can’t turn back time, that I can’t rewrite what’s already written.\n\nEvery tear I shed feels like a reminder of what I’ve lost, of the emptiness that’s taking place. And every time I cry, I wonder if it will ever stop— …",

    "selftext": "Is this actually pedophilia or POCD\n\nIn context I don’t have anything checked out yet so I’m not “diagnosed” with anything yet. Back when I was 11-14 I used to get aroused/get off to horrible things that might even touch lines with pedophilia and zoophilia. I didn’t do it because I’m attracted to children or animal, but I did it because it just reminded me of the idea of “sex” or a kink that I have, and the result was me getting off to very vague videos with context of children/animals. I don’t know how to explain the feeling but basically I could get aroused by anything that even remotely reminded me of sex, and this even includes objects placed in a sexual manner, because back then I didn’t know that p*rn existed and didn’t know what actual sex looked like. I swear I’m not actually attracted to animals or children and that’s not what arouses me but it’s the part where it reminds me of something I am into (kinks, sex) I was stupid back then and didn’t know pedo and zoophile was a thing, I’m pretty overly sexual to the fact that I found out how to get off by myself with no context at 11.  I touched my dogs genitalia out of curiosity and a while ago it just hit me what I have really done and I’ve been stressing over it for a long time now, like thinking about it 24/7 not being able to function normally. I haven’t watched child p*rn or tried to search for it and would never do that either. I’m not interested/attracted to children/animals I don’t like children (in fact they kind of piss me off) nor animals in a romantic manner, I have a cute dog which has a positive relationship with me and I would never do such a gross thing. I’m considering suicide\n\n\nps. I don’t know if this is more context or if this helps but I wasn’t sexually assaulted in any case when I was a child. I was however assaulted regularly (not sexual, and minor assault like hitting/pulling hair) as a child in very young age, from toxic relationships and because kids are just kids. I’ve done similar too in response but that’s for another post to freak out over. I don’t know if this helps, please help I don’t want to be a pedophile/zoophile or anything of that matter it’s so gross to even think about but if I am I feel like maybe I should kill myself. I don’t want to and I don’t even know if I’ll be able to bring myself to do it because I’m a coward and I don’t dare to, but I seriously don’t want to be a pedophile..\n\n\n\nEdit: \nFirst of all thank you all for supporting me and helping me through this tough time. I’m still trying to work out and sort out my thoughts so this was really helpful.\n\nMost people recommended therapy, and I think that’s a good idea and I might try it out sometime once I have stable income and financial stability (yes I’m underage 16F and living with her mother) \n\nI would like to clarify some more background information, when I was 13-15 I think I struggled with OCD not POCD, just OCD. I would repeat an action daily or everytime before an specific activity, and I’m gonna pop a really weird example but one thing that I did was that everytime I showered when I wash my legs I have to go five seconds standing on one foot without the other one touching the floor. And if I fail I restart. Sounds stupid and it first started out as a normal thing because I was tryna wash properly but over time I started doing it every time because I started getting convinced that if I don’t something bad would happen. I had several cases of similar issues, which I won’t elaborate into because they’re silly. At the time I didn’t realize because it was like 2020-2022 the time where it was popular to stereotype OCD as being a neat freak or organising everything. \nNot sure if this matters and I’m no expert but is it possible OCD-> POCD? \nI’ve also seen some comments on intrusive thoughts and yes I do have them, not as regularly as when I obsess over my moral issues but I do have them\n\n\n\nEdit 3: for everyone out there who’s a little concerned for my well being, im okay for now! Thank you all for the responses! \n\n\nI also noticed this post was getting more popular, and I would just like to say feel free to share it to whoever/whatever relates or is interested in this! But please don’t make content on it or anything like that, what I’m saying is that I don’t want to find my post on those crazy redditor videos with those Minecraft parkours at the back if ykyk 😭",

But when it all ends, when the whole day fades into the night, i have to face the same walls, same people that raised me like a farm whore.

Not even feeling the slightest bit of remorse, regret, depravity, alienation or low self esteem. How does none of this affect me? Some of it does and it fuels my suicidal ideation but I've gotten over the fact that I can't ever kill myself. I value my pathetic life so much, clinging to the fact that I'll make it somehow.

I'm scared that if i rat out my abuser then my mom will go beyond insane, my dad will end up beating my abuser, most probably me as well (he's conservative and a strict religionist.) And i don't want the things to end up on a bad note. I thought I could complete my 3 year under grad course and get a job in order to move out of my house but my will to believe in this has been running out since forever.

My dad still talks to me which isn't something anyone in my family can really say aside from him. My wife would be so crushed if I did it. I know they would feel so guilty. \n\nBut things with my wife and I get complicated and I'm deeply insecure and always worried that we aren't compatible and that shes wasting her time on me and I'm not good enough for her.

I've put in years of practice but never really developed the skill. I've never been particularly talented. I don't have an enjoyable personality. And I'm NOT smart so I don't really bring anything to societies table. No one cares. No one's looking. No one gaf if I die.  Except ig my dad and my spouse. \n\nI don't wanna life some worthless miserable life where I do NOTHING but work miserable fucking jobs that doesn't even offer breaks, for companies that wouldnt GAF if I WAS hit by a train. I don't wanna spend the little time I have to myself too tired and drained to do anything I enjoy. I don't wanna spend the rest of my miserable fucking life like that. Fuck that.

Can't expect the yearly pay rises to be above the inflation rate.\n\n  \nThe best part is, I'll still have to see her from time to time since we work in the same place, just different ends of the building. Don't know if I'll be able to handle seeing her.",

We broke up because we were both having mental health issues that were creating problems but we wanted to get back together, we were taking a break for trying to work on ourselves. I feel like I pushed him away. I was depressed and emotionally distant. Especially during the end of the relationship and first week of the break. I barely talked or showed affection anymore. We basically said we're not looking for anyone else but if one of us were to get involved with someone we would tell each other to figure out how we'd want to move forward. He lied about starting to see someone else and the way I found out was she came to his apartment while I was there and he was out. She didn't know he was still seeing his ex either. That caused a big falling out, we stopped speaking for a while. We kept having this hot and cold where I would try to forgive him then I'd get upset and we'd stop speaking for a while again. During this time l'd see him still talking to her (we all went to the same college) at events and stuff, saw them flirt at least once but he would basically be like \"you keep going back and forth on if you want to speak to me or not its not my fault she does\". We turned into something toxic and messy but we started as something so beautiful. I feel like I pushed him into the arms of another girl. I feel like thats basically what he said when he talked about it. Logically I know we were both at fault but I can’t help but wonder if I reached out sooner during our break, or if I had been better in the relationship if things would’ve been different. ",

    "selftext": "So, I'm 17 now. Everything feels so different and the same, I still feel like I did when I was 12 during peak COVID, I'm laying in bed every day doing nothing but it had real consequences now, I'm close to being kicked out of college because my attendance is so low and honestly I don't care. I'm clearly not okay and it feels like nobody is noticing, my sister recently got diagnosed with cancer and I want to be there for there because she's going through so much, she has two kids and I want to offer to babysit but I'm so unreliable, I skip out of plans like they don't matter because I can't bring myself to get up. Last year I got so close to ending it, I told my mother, she kept pressing and pressing when I sent her a long text telling her exactly what I needed from her in that moment but she basically ignored it. Then in November I actually tried and it was pathetic, I thought I could jump into a river and it would do most of the work but it didn't, it was waist deep, I just stood there and then had to wade through the water to get out, it left me aching and so, so cold. I got home and had to lay under my blankets for hours so I didn't become hypothermic and it was pathetic. My room smelled like mildew until I could bring myself to put the clothes covered in the much from the river into the washing machine. I'm starting to turn to substances and my mother is helping me indulge in it and I know it's wrong but I can't bring myself to care, she says I can smoke or have weed because she's scared of losing me, she doesn't know how to help and it's damaging but at this point I feel like I need to get high to make it go away for a bit. She took me to the GP the morning after the night I told her I was going to end it and the guy was nice but not even he could do anything, the youth service said two years ago I've done everything they could recommend and they accepted that self harm was just something I did. The man I saw in the GP said I most likely couldn't get onto antidepressants until I was 18 because they can make teenagers more suicidal but I honestly don't think I can be more suicidal at this point. I need help and I've exhausted all the resources. Every day it gets harder and I'm just doing nothing, I can't go to college without pain, any amount of light gives me migraines, people on campus won't stop meowing at me or asking about why I don't use my cane on campus and it's exhausting, I have to wake up at 6 am to go at 8 AM to college and I get home at 5 which doesn't seem like a lot, especially for people with full time jobs but I can't handle it, I come home in pain and exhausted, I can't even use willpower to get myself to college every day, when I was going in the first term, I had 100% attendance for the first two weeks and even then I was planning what days I would have time to shower, Wednesday's are half days so usually I'd shower on Wednesdays and Monday mornings and that's it, I feel gross and disgusting for it but at this point, I've attended college twice this year and I haven't showered since then, I'm disgusting and I hate it but I can't even bring myself to take care of my hygiene or anything, I've had two of my molars surgically removed already and I'm still not brushing my teeth, I haven't gone outside, I don't know if I nescaserally want to die but I do know I don't want to live like this. My ex who I never properly broke up with started dating someone else and unadded me on everything when we were actually on good terms. I have a few friends in college but I don't know if I can even keep going for them, they're all so nice and they deserve to be happy and I can't stop thinking about how much it would hurt them if I was gone, one girl I talk to most is so nice, whenever I'm in college she talks about how she missed me and it makes me happy that someone cares but I also want to distance myself from everyone so it doesn't hit so hard if I do end up gone forever. Last year I got the confirmation that my hospital can't do anything else for my eyes and they've steadily been getting worse, my nystagmus has too and it's exhausting, I can't sleep and when I do it's always too much, I stay up for days and sleep for twenty hours, I want to tell someone, to get some kind of help but I've lost hope, I've already been failed multiple times already. I don't want to fail myself by giving in and letting go of everything I've been working so hard for. I never got my GCSE's because my attendance in secondary school ended up being 0.05* in the end. My college attendance is 43% and there's always a meeting lined up about it, they're going to kick me out and I won't have a path to follow anyone and it's terrifying. I'm scared of growing up because I was never treated like I would, if I didn't make an effort to make myself look as unique as possible, the only thing people would look at me and see is my blindness. I want to be someone and I'm afraid of the very real possibility that I never will be. I lost my binder a little after Christmas and even though I don't use it all of the time, it was oqe if the only things that made me feel more comfortable and gave me agency over how I looked. I'm so scared.\n\nSorry for the rant and I'm sorry if it doesn't make sense, I'm not thinking straight and I don't know what to do anymore.",

    "selftext": "Hello community,  \nThrowaway for obvious reasons.\n\nI don’t want to live anymore. I see no purpose in my existence, and it has been this way for over 30 years.  \nI think the thought first occurred to me when I was 8. Now, I’m a sick and failed over-40-year-old.  \nSince my childhood, I’ve suffered from anxiety disorders and depression. There wasn’t any specific trigger for it; I was probably just born this way. That’s the only way I can explain it.\n\nI somehow dragged myself through school and vocational training and worked until 2010. I had a relatively “normal” life in my 20s and had my mental health somewhat under control. I went out a lot, had many friends and acquaintances, and two long-term relationships. But at some point, something in my head snapped.\n\nI went to a day clinic, then inpatient treatment, completed two rounds of therapy, and took psychiatric medication.  \nIn 2018, my driver’s license was revoked because of a medication, and a medical-psychological assessment was required. I was also retired due to my illnesses.\n\nFrom 2021-2023, I was in another relationship. After so many disappointments, I gave love another chance, and it became the best relationship of my life. By now, I would probably be living with her and her daughter in the city if she hadn’t cheated on me for months. I’m still not over it, and since then, everything has been going completely downhill.\n\nDuring all this time, even during the better periods, the longing for death was always there. I don’t know why. As a sort of emergency exit, sometimes even as a radiant option.\n\nI live in a very rural area and, due to a lack of mobility, I can’t go anywhere. I mean, seriously, nowhere.  \nI don’t have any friends. But over the years, I’ve developed physical illnesses. Because of a botched operation, I’m stool incontinent. I also suffer from the incurable disease hidradenitis suppurativa, which requires several excruciating surgeries every year.\n\nMy quality of life is 0.0. I lie in bed all day in the dark with pain and my eyes closed, get up to go to the toilet, and spend time online. My hobbies and interests no longer mean anything to me. My mother tries very hard to support me, does my shopping, cleans here. I appreciate all of this so much. But she can’t make my illnesses disappear or make me feel better. Other than that, I don’t have anyone anymore. It’s sadly true what they say: friends withdraw when you’re sick. It’s as if I no longer exist.\n\nI once “had it all”—mobility, love, work, independence. By now, I’ve lost it all, and I’ll never be able to regain it.  \nI feel like… nothing. No longer human, trapped in my prisons: my apartment and my body. I can’t imagine lying around like this for another 30 years; it’s the greatest torture imaginable. It just doesn’t make any sense. Even my over-80-year-old grandmother manages better than I do.\n\nI wish every day for a stroke, a heart attack, to just not wake up anymore. If I could, I would voluntarily throw myself into a heroin addiction.  \nWhen I sleep, everything is fine. Thanks for reading.\n\n(This is not an announcement.) Translation by ChatGPT.",

    "selftext": "I'm 18f, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was 13 and depression/ anxiety at 11 or 12. I used to use a lot of drugs to escape but now I'm sober. I don't drink because I was SAd while drunk. The rape happened at 16 by a close friend. I can't seem to feel clean, the assault has manifested its way into every aspect of my life. I don't understand how I could ever be pure again, be beautiful. I drown and distract myself with sex. When someone isn't in bed with me I feel so alone, so inadequate. I give myself up easily, I have no self respect, I hurt myself with sex and pain. I go on walks every day and daydream about what it'd be like to have a good life, a beautiful body and a nice personality. Lately I've been spiraling, being bipolar causes me to constantly be in a state of false optimism and then very rapidly go down into the void of hopelessness and pain. I'm trying so hard and it isn't enough. I know I'm young, I know I have my whole life ahead of me, I'm not naive, I've lived like this for years. I can't seem to escape pain, and at the same time I can't seem to attract and enable pain. I just don't see the point, I'm never going to be content enough to gain back passion, I'm never going to be clean enough to be seen for who I could've been, who I am besides the rape. I'm never going to be stable enough to be able to work and provide a life for myself. I'm dependent, on everything. People, drugs, sex, my medication. I just want out and I can't get out. The only thing keeping me clinging on is art and poetry. My pain makes beautiful poems, but it isn't enough. I'm trying.  I really am. I need something or someone to save me, although I know I can't be saved by anything external. I can't be saved by god, by love, by sex, by drugs. I have to do it myself and I just don't have the energy. I just don't know what to do, I numb myself because when I feel how heavy the agony and despair weighs on me I begin to feel physically ill. I can't maintain a job, presence in school, with friends or family because of how sick I get from stress and anxiety. It all feels so hopeless, I just want to be heard, I want to be seen. It feels like I'll never be valued until I'm dead. I truly hope that everybody who is on here and reads this feels less alone, i understand you, I hear you and I see you. You deserve to be heard and so do I. I'm trying to hard to be better, I just don't see the appeal of this life anymore ",

    "selftext": "I have no history of trauma. The only slightly bad thing that has ever happened to me is that my mother abandoned me when I was a baby, but I had my wonderful grandmother who stepped into that role, and I could not have asked for anyone better to raise me. I have friends who love and care about me. I have a job with steady and reasonable pay, and even my coworkers like me and talk to me every day. I am a student at a great college, which I am on mental health leave from, but I am free to return whenever I want. \n\n\nThere is so much good in my life, so much going for me, that it feels like a slap in the face to people with actual problems that I want to throw that all away. So what that my grandma and my dad hate that I’m trans? There are people who get kicked out onto the streets for that. I should just get over myself and not care whether they use a damn pronoun or not. Why should it matter that my dad is mean to me? People have fathers that beat and rape them, and my relationship with mine was good up until a few years ago. \n\nLogically I know that suicidal thoughts are a symptom of depression, so that should make it easier for me to overcome them. It’s not really what I want, just my brain telling me it’s what I want. So why am I still planning to kill myself on Sunday? Why would I let a disorder take my life when it has so much promise? But I can’t make myself care about any of it anymore. I don’t care about my future. It’s selfish, but I barely even care about leaving everyone behind anymore. I’m not special and I’m not that good of a person, so they should be able to move on just fine. I know it will hurt, but I don’t contribute much to anything. I’m lazy and a little stupid. \n\n\nMy best friend wished me a happy birthday today and said they love me and they’re glad I’m here. My reaction was to feel sad that there are people who love me so much that they’d be utterly devastated if I died, and it frustrated me that I can’t kill myself guilt free. What kind of person thinks like that? Someone so selfish they don’t even deserve to be alive. My friends and family deserve someone better who wouldn’t even dream of leaving them behind like that. So does my cat. I tried writing out a note and individual texts for everyone, and there were so many to do that it got overwhelming, so what does that say? \n\nThe one thing making me hesitate is that it will hurt or that it won’t work and I’ll just end up in a psych ward again. Usually I skip the step of attempting and just check myself in for a while because ODing isn’t that great of a method in terms of reliability and pain. Those times I knew I didn’t really want to die. I just wanted help and for things to get better. But I’m very tempted to try on the off chance that I can get it right. I couldn’t conceptualize death back then like I can now. I’m pretty sure it wouldn’t feel like anything, and that’s what I long for. I don’t want to exist. I want to feel nothing. \n\nThere must be some hope for me because I decided to stay alive long enough to turn 22 and to watch Timothée Chalamet on SNL, so maybe I can try sticking it out even beyond that. I counted my grandma’s blood pressure pills, and I read that a man died taking about half of the amount I have access to, so I’m pretty sure if I actually had the guts to do it, it could work. It would be very unpleasant, I’m sure, but it probably would get the job done. \n\nIf anyone actually read all of this, thanks for listening, and I hope you stick around to find out if life has better things to offer. Very hypocritical of me to say, but I mean it. ",

The weight of life was off my shoulders. It was weird though how I didn't feel like myself. I felt more of a shell of who I once was like I was already in transition to death. What an interesting experience. \n\nMy husband interfered without realizing at first what was going on. Once he understood it shattered my soul. The uncontrollable sobs coming from a person who is your other half, your heart and soul. That broke me. I never thought I would hear the sound of his heart breaking. I wasn't prepared. This was the first time that he was more broken than me. \nWe had talked about my ending my life many times and he always gets sad and tries to comfort me through my \"episodes\" of finally having enough, but this time was different. Everything was different. \n\nHe knew. It's like his soul could feel the releasing of mine. The transition while I was still here. I'd never felt such a thing. I didn't know it was possible. He started to panic. Having a full blown panic attack brought me back to myself for a moment. I did what any loving wife would do regardless if I was the reason for it all. It didn't last long but next thing I know I'm breathing with him while his entire body is over mine while I hold him. I feel his fear radiating through me and yet I'm still calm. It's sad knowing that seeing him in the worst state I've ever seen him in didn't change anything. It hurt seeing him that way and knowing it was my fault but it didn't change my mind. \n\nHaving his body pressed against mine grounded me and the calm started lifting. The switch in my brain finally flipped and I started crying. The calm was gone and the overwhelming emotions were back and I didn't know what to do other than cry. He noticed the switch and changed positions. He started asking me questions knowing how to get me to word vomit my feelings and I did for an hour. We talked back and forth through our own tears just trying to find a solution and get our feelings out in the process until we were so exhausted that we couldn't speak. He handed me my sleep medication and stayed with me until I fell asleep. \n\nI woke up at 4am after only having gone to sleep around midnight. Still hazy from my medication the calm washes over me again. Sleep being the one thing I wanted but forever. I try to push those thoughts away and shove the feelings down but no matter how hard I try they are persistent. Last night has seemed to change nothing. ",

For some background I'm a 17 year old male soon to be in year 12 of high school. I was once a very cheerful and outgoing kid but this changes when I was 14-15. I then became highly introverted and pessimistic, and I largely kept to myself. Past memories started to resurface, memories that I'm highly ashamed of and as time goes on new ones are added on top. My mind occasionally gets filled with these flashbacks like once every other day, during the school holidays and multiple times per day at school because triggers are just everywhere over there. Even when I'm not experiencing flashbacks I'm just worried about my future, I have no idea what to do after school and my parents have been pressuring me to get things figured out, this has just made me feel completely lost and hopeless. Along with how it just constantly triggers my memories, school has just been incredibly stressful. I'm currently doing ATAR in school so in year 11 I've been stressing out about keeping my grades reasonable, I ended the year with B's in just about everything due to that year being a bit if a lazy year for me. Even though I am currently on school holidays it continues to stress me out, mainly because my parents are constantly saying stuff like you should be studying right now and you really need to pull your head in this year. We don't have the books yet and it's been hard to find stuff on the curriculum but they still insist and the more they've been saying this stuff the less motivated I feel and the more stressed I get because by actually studying it just feels like it would come across as it being because they have been telling me to do so rather than because I want to do so. This constant build up of stress, shame and hoplessness has led me to contemplate ending my life, the only reason I haven't done it yet is because of how it will effect everyone else and that it will likely get others to do the same. I've already got a plan on how I would do it if it comes to it and I'm in the process of writing a suicide note just in case.",

I told her that night infront of everyone, he threw hot coffee in my face and then my mom kicked me out of the house.\n\nMy mom was always trying to end her life, I grew up spending weeks in and out of the hospital by her bedside from overdoses. \n\nWas homeless from age 18 to 35. no one would hire me.\nLost my mom when I was 25, my biological dad when I was 23, only knew him for a few months. \n\nDidn't learn to read or write until I was 18/19 and homeless. That is also when I learned I had dyslexia and minor brain damage from years of beatings from my step dad.\n\nFast forward to today after 30 years of abuse from my family. my aunts, my cousins and being outcasted by them for over 10 years. I am turning 44 monday and I can't keep living like this.\n\nI was diagnosed with Cptsd, severe chronic depression, paranoia, severe social anxiety and suicidal ideation. I have no friends and go months with no one to talk to, i have no one to game with and I have no support from anyone. I owe 3 years of payments on 3 different credit cards and I am -180 in the bank and living on ssi. I can't keep going like this...\n\nI have never had a girlfriend, women don't want me, I have never had a vehicle and I desperately need a minivan to help me get around to places. I had a crown break off and can't get to a dentist because of no dental insurance. I was never taught dental hygiene growing up and now I need all of my teeth pulled and dentures but cannot afford it.\n\nI live in a very small town in texas that is 30 miles away from anything and have to doordash everything which costs so much. \n\nI can't keep living like this and being completely alone all of the time. So I am ending it on my birthday on the 27th.",

    "selftext": "15 years in ems as a medic. Married 11 of those to a woman with a terminal illness who has been given roughly 9 ish more years to live. \n\nShe’s sick off and on, so I’ve always took the brunt of the workload. I’ve worked 100 hours a week (in shifts of 24 hours) for the past 11 years. \n\nIt’s what I had to do to provide a lifestyle above poverty. We have a household of a constant 5, with 1 more coming and going part time. Shit ain’t cheap. \n\nAnyhow. 11 years of hell. You name it, weve experienced it in our marriage. Stealing, lying, cheating, addiction, domestic violence, child protective services, cops, jail…..seriously. We must be the most toxic couple ever. \n\nThis is what “there is no such thing as divorce, no matter what” got us. \n\n4-5 days ago I walked up to her, and she had no idea I was there. She was texting another guy. All the things happened. The yelling. The fighting. The denial. The gas lighting. She left. From that point forward, she had disappeared off the radar every night between 10pm and 6am. She says she’s working. As a CNA. But her shifts are actually 2pm-10pm. She says she picks up extra shifts because she doesn’t want to listen to me bitch. \n\nHer exact words were “the more you bitch, the more I’ll do it”. \n\nThat was the final straw. I prepared the divorce paperwork. \n\nThen she reminded me. She’s worked part time our entire marriage. She has a terminal illness. She will take me for every penny she can get, and I’ve had an income of 110k for at least the last 3 years. Which means the court will consider that my “normal” income and use it to set child support and alimony. Even if I kept the home, I’d be so broke I’ll lose it. \n\nI could pack my shit and walk out. Disappear and never look back. My dad did that. I swore I’d never be him. It took me years of therapy to understand it wasn’t me and my sisters that made him do that. Still, I could never do that to my kids. \n\nWhat I can do though. I have life insurance. A 2 million dollar policy that is over 2 years old. And I’ve confirmed they pay out 100% for suicide after 2 years. \n\nI have the opportunity to both solve my heart ache, depression, anxiety and also make sure they are set in life financially. And I intend to make that happen. \n\nAfter 15 years of seeing suicides, I know what works and what doesn’t. Guns are great, for a closed casket. Though the failure rate is higher than comfortable. \n\nCutting is painful and slow. Even the carotid arteries (which is a simple Nick) can take a while to pass. Though, you’re unconscious for most of it. There is a high risk of someone finding you too quickly, and not being successful. \n\nPills lead to vomiting a lot. And choking on your own vomit sounds like a horrible way to die. No thanks. \n\nHanging. Well there’s that. But again, you’re awake for quite some time. Though not “painful” your brain is comprehending the feeling of not breathing for longer than comfortable. \n\nOverdose by heroine/ fentanyl. This seems pretty good. Lots of people have done it. But of course, when you work side by side with the cops, it’s not easy to find. Like I don’t know anyone I can call to get dope. \n\nSo that leads me to CO poisoning. Car, in garage. 30 minutes and I’m fast asleep. 1 hour and I’m for sure taking a dirt nap. And I think I can get that 1 hour while the kids are at school and she is gone doing god knows who. I think the car would run out of gas and die before the kids get home. We don’t park in the garage, so they wouldn’t know to look there (garage is detached). So kids won’t find me. \n\nI have some things to do before I go. Like writing a will. Changing life insurance beneficiaries so my cheating wife gets nothing. And taking the time to drop thank you’d to the great people in my life. \n\nThis world sucks. And I don’t wanna live here anymore. ",

But it's less about ceasing to exist and more about ending the suffering. Sometimes I wonder if I really want to die or if I just want my life to get better. I also think about other people dying too. Particularly the guy who fucked me over. He asked me what he could do for me to finally be okay and I snapped at him telling him to die so I could be happy.\n\nAnd what I hate about it is that my problems don't seem as big as other people's. \n\nMy parents keep fighting over a ten-year-old issue of my dad supposedly cheating and I don't even know if there is any truth to it. I don't care to find out. A guy left me for another girl without telling me he was with her, stringing me on for a week until I finally found out. He was the only person I ever opened up to about my parents and he still fucked me over. He said sorry, but it just wasn't enough for me because he doesn't seem to have any regret or remorse for the pain and trauma he caused me. I got made fun of and bullied over social media by his girlfriend and her friends even though I never wanted to hurt her because I didn't know. \n\nBut I still do well in school. My grades never slipped. I make some money on the side. I buy new makeup. I still have my friends who have loved me and supported me since day one. I was granted a good scholarship even though I was sure I did poorly on the qualifying exam.\n\nIt shouldn't feel like the end of the world. I'm still getting what I want. I should feel blessed because of how lucky I am. But every day, the feeling just gets worse. Sometimes I am able to get it out of my head for a bit. I talked to our guidance counselor and poured out what I have been bottling up for months. But I relapse often when I'm alone lying in my bed at night, wondering what is so wrong with me and why I couldn't be enough and what did I ever do to deserve any of this.",

While mental illness has been a lifelong struggle for me, the last 4 or 5 months have felt so unbearably claustrophobic that I fear I can no longer see a way out. After recently attempting to hang myself in a public bathroom and then overdosing on an old supply of antidepressants, I’ve decided to turn to reddit in a last ditch grasp for clarity. Apologies in advance for post length.\n\nTo answer your imminent queries, and to provide situational context: I have engaged with numerous psychologists, psychiatrists, paediatricians, counsellors, and therapists since age 5, and have trialled a slew of medications (SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, beta blockers, benzos, atypicals, stimulants, etc) as an adult. I don’t smoke, I don’t use drugs recreationally, and I only drink socially. I go to the gym 4-5 days a week, I almost exclusively drink water, and food sensitivities force me to maintain a relatively rigid but healthy diet. I hold an undergraduate degree in a STEM field and am about 60% of the way through a post-graduate research degree in a more specialised sub-field. I have enjoyed stable (ish) casual employment in a semi-adjacent field for years now, and both my boss and supervisor are incredibly kind and supportive individuals. I make a vested effort to try new things and meet new people, I’ve been fortunate enough to travel somewhat frequently over the last 18 months or so, and I have numerous hobbies I’m very passionate about. I have close friends who hold me accountable and with whom mutual improvement feels natural, and I feel as though I will never be without a shoulder to cry, an ear to listen, or a couch to sleep on. All of this is to say that, on paper, I feel as though I’m ticking many of the boxes you might equate with general life satisfaction, yet I find myself so entrenched in deep emotional turmoil that suicide feels like the only solace. \n\nI have, over the years, convinced myself that I’m incapable of integrating into society to the same capacity as those around me, that I’m grotesque and have an inherently disturbing presence, that there will never be anything I can do better than, or even as well as, the next person, that I’ve somehow managed to get by on sheer luck and unintentional manipulation, and that I bring nothing but misfortune and discomfort to those I cross paths with. I am always seeking opportunities to step outside of my comfort zone, but no matter how these situations play out I always end up feeling a deep sense of shame. Every time someone in my life compliments me on my work-ethic/skills/social-fearlessness/etc I feel increasingly fraudulent, and I try to avoid research/hobby specifics as talking points for fear of having to respond to any positive affirmations in a way that doesn’t convey insincerity. Even though I can internally acknowledge that I have some good qualities, have set myself up reasonably well in spite of many setbacks, and have friends who like me, I can’t bring myself to truly internalise any of it. I believe these feelings are the result of, or perhaps compounded by, autism (diagnosed around 6 years ago), as well as a lack of social integration and positive parental relationships as a child. All of these factors have, in my opinion, influenced my ability to connect with both myself and others, but they’re so deeply ingrained in me as a person that I feel I will never find a ‘normal’ in which I can thrive. I kept expecting things to get better with age, but the older I get, the less I feel I understand the people and world around me.\n\nBeyond these self-beliefs I hold, which have been manageable to a point, a concerning behavioural change I’ve been grappling with these past 4-5 months has been the shift from long-term passive suicidal ideation to catastrophic, rapid onset , “I need to kill myself right now” states that I’m simply not equipped to navigate. All I can manage during these extreme lows is to hide under my bed sheets and hope I have the will to keep myself there until it passes – and it really, truly, feels like hiding. It’s as though some part of my brain is hunting and terrorising me, and that I’ll lose all control over my actions if I’m found. I feel like a hostage in my own body. There is undeniably a part of me that wants to keep living, but given how mentally taxing my baseline is outside of this, it has become harder and harder not to give in when all there is to hold on to is less severe anguish. I was prescribed agomelatine 2 and a half months ago right after my suicide attempts, and while initially I found it to be extremely beneficial, cracks have started to form. I’m slowly returning to a state of catastrophic unpredictability, and I don’t think I have it in me to keep fighting. I feel like I’m going completely insane, and I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m so tired. I requested a variety of tests (full hormone array, bloods, thyroid function, etc) to see if I could tie the sudden downturn to a physical cause, but everything came back normal and left me feeling even more hopeless. In the interest of spending what little money I have while I still can, I’ve booked a solo holiday overseas in a month’s time as a last hurrah of sorts, though at the rate I’m going I’m not even sure if I’ll last that long.  \n  \nThis is a garbled mess, and I’m not really sure what I’m expecting to gain by putting this out there, but I hope someone might be able to relate to and/or alleviate the intense feelings of chaos and isolation I’m enveloped in right now.",

    "selftext": "Hello Reddit,\n\nSo I have suicidal thoughts. Way too often and it's getting worse. It recently led me to try the national 24/7 suicide hotline in my country. I would say out of curiosity because I'm not ready to end myself from fear of failing to do so. And what a ride it's been.\nIt doesn't even properly ring before you get a recorded answer. It says that nobody can answer and they hope to hear from you soon if you try to call later. Of course, later is never late enough. I tried several times until I skipped to what they advise doing if you can't wait for help : calling emergencies.\nAt this point I'm pondering what I am doing because emergencies is not what I need and their purpose is to help people in danger, not listening to John Doe's existential crisis but here I go.\nThe dude's reaction once I explained the situation is exactly \"what am I supposed to do ?\" in an obviously irritated and not-my-problem kind of tone. Understandable, not your job good sir. After a brief exchange and I've apologised for wasting his time best used for something more important, he at least gives me another phone number to call.\nThis one rings, great. Then I get the inavoidable \"can't take your call now\" record. From what I understand it's a 24/7 hotline for lonely people in need of a talk.\nBack to suicide hotline because there's no more backup plan, still not later enough.\nI had to confess all this to somebody because of my inability to hide how far down I got anymore. I called the suicide hotline in front of this person without hesitation knowing full well nobody will ever answer and so the guy gets to hear the abomination of a message they deliver.\nSo I came to a conclusion. Had I been on the verge of ending it all when calling, this would have dealt the final blows (because it's been several blows to me) and I'd have crossed the line for good. How many people might have experienced just that and felt even more desperate and lonely when they were already at rock bottom ? Has this hotline killed more people than they helped ?\nSo if you're alone and in critical need of help in my country, well I salute you and hope you'll rest in peace. Because nobody gives a damn fuck.",

    "selftext": "I just recently moved to Chicago from Florida for a fresh start. Just 3 weeks ago, I was lively, optimistic, lighthearted and an open book. Since moving here, things have gone downhill, fast. I expected the first few months to be rough, getting the hang of things and what not. But what I've experienced so far is Murphy's law in full effect.\n\nThe day my lease was going to end and I was going to drive 16 hours to Chicago, a major part on my car failed. I had to be frantic and blow some cash to fix the issue, praying that I'd make it afterwards.\n\nAfter about 800 miles later, I hear a noise from my car and it turns out the brake caliper didn't even anything keeping it in place because the mechanic from FL forgot to put the bolts back in. Had to shell out cash for that.\n\nFew days after I got to Chicago, I got a parking ticket for being in a spot that I was fine in before. I found a studio to rent after some searching and put in a rental application. The person handling the application was very invasive and passive aggressive, looking for any reason to deny me. When I got fed up, they denied my application after 2 weeks of back and forth documentation. Any time I reach out to find a place now, the listing is bait and switch for another apartment, or I get no response, or the place isn't how it appeared online at all.\n\nI got a job within the first few days at a fine dining restaurant. They were set to open in a couple weeks, and I was new there, so learning the ropes was priority. Too bad the training was fucking ass, and I essentially had to train myself. I studied my ass off, learning the menu, steps of service, verbose food descriptions, and what not. The day to officially open came and then guess fucking what? 2 days after the opening the general manager quit, the head chef quit, and the HR manager quit. I came into work yesterday just to be told that they are cutting hours until further notice because of that and because they aren't getting enough customers. So now, I basically don't have a fucking job.\n\nSo today, I took some printed resumes and went to a few restaurants in-person after I had applied online, so that I can be a face to remember. It's cold as fuck, but I don't care. I walked from place to place, about an hour total. 2 of the restaurants had staff that were really nice and 1 of them had a total bitch rolling her eyes and telling me to apply online, and their staff was stuck up and miserable. I said have a good day and she didn't say anything. Fuck, is it that fucking hard to treat people with courtesy and respect? Have some fucking dignity. I walked 30 fucking minutes in the winter to get there and just be brief, and that's how you fucking act? Wait till you need a job.\n\nWhen I was done, I took out my phone to redirect myself back to the parking garage where my car was. Phone suddenly died. Funny, because I had 90% battery before I left the fucking car. So now I'm fucked.\n\nI went into a mall, asked for directions to a place. They pointed one out (good person), I walked into a walgreens, grabbed the cheapest charger and cord which went for 40 fucking dollars. I said fuck it, I'll return it later. Walked into a hotel, kind desk lady let me charge my phone, then I pulled out google maps and found my way back. What was supposed to be a simple resume dropoff turned into a long stupid fucking ordeal.\n\nHere's another one. A couple weeks ago, I went to a bar let's call Nickel, had a shift beer, then hopped to another bar shortly after (let's call Dime) and had a beer there. Then I left Dime and went back to Nickel. At Nickel, all I had was a water. I was sitting down with my cup of water, and I accidentally swiped the cup and a little water spilled on the counter. The bartender saw this, wiped it down, and I said thank you. Not 5 minutes later, the bouncer tells me I have to leave because the bartender said I had too much to drink. The fuck? I had 1 beer, that they knew of ( and also tipped), and a fucking water. So this shithead is kicking me out because I spilled a little water? I was PISSED after I left. Never got kicked out of a bar before, and the one time it happens it's because of some bullshit. Nobody here would believe me, hell it surprised me, but that's all there was to the story. I was polite, respectful and didn't disturb anybody.\n\nEvery day some bullshit happens. Every single day I've spent in Chicago has been laced with bullshit. Every single FUCKING DAY. From the 1st to the 23rd. I can't catch a fucking break. Hell, I went to get a haircut the other day and even after I showed him a picture of the hair I had before and explained how I wanted it that way, he fucked it up. So I had to buzzcut that shit afterwards. As silly as it sounds, it's impacted my confidence.\n\nI don't want to play the victim. I'm not homeless and I can buy food, so there's that. I ain't starving and I'm still paying for an airBNB, so I gotta roof over my head. But between everything I gotta deal with..these things wouldn't be too much on their own, but it's CUMALATIVE AND IT's ADDING UP. Feel like I'm going fucking mad. I gotta admit I wanna taste the barrel of a gun right now. Goddamn it's actually a pleasant thought.\n\nI moved to this state for a fresh start. I tried ironing out my issues in Florida before I got here, but it just seems like they resurfaced and carried over. Even though I knew it wouldn't be easy, even though I expected the transition to be rocky, I just didn't expect it to be like this.\n\nWorst of all, my fucking experiences with people here. In Florida, people are much more amiable and don't act like you gotta rifle pointed at their head when you try to have conversation with them, like the way it is here. Half the people here, if not more, seem allergic to social interaction and are just stuck in their own little bubble. And whenever I tried approaching girls here I've gotten much harsher reactions here than any time in Florida. I've probably come up to 100+ girls in Florida and 90%+ of the time I get positive reactions from them. In Chicago, these girls act super cold, distant, and act like saying hello is a death sentence. What the fuck?\n\nDude, right now I hate this fucking city. I'm beginning to regret this. I just want one day without bullshit. One day. I went from being kind and lighthearted a few weeks ago to a fucking depressed, bitter soul already. I'm trying so damn hard. I have to keep reminding myself of what I've gone through before and just 'it is what it is' but holy fuck, it's getting to me. I have to keep reminding myself that I'm a man and that these challenges define your manhood, but I feel myself crumbling. My head is so fucked right now. There's been an abundance of bad things and very little good going on this past month. I have 2 rifles in my storage unit that I can grab, and just end my life. I could end all of this with 1 bullet. I'm tired.\n\nDidn't think I'd be here because I think it's just a sad depressed echo chamber. Scrolling through, it looks like the 9th circle of hell. If you read this to the end, I give you props. I just wanted to type this out. ",

I am currently unemployed (since a week) but I do odd jobs for money(just to get by). I am not in a relationship and I still have my home until the 31st of January. \nA year and a half ago my relationship of 11 years ended and I lost quite a few friends. Me and my ex had a shared group of friends and it was definitely more her friends than mine. Dont get me wrong I still have a large friend group.\nI always said I would die at 27. of course with the group you understand what it is like. I tried on my 27th birthday and I failed. Now almost a year later, therapy is not working and I see everything collapsing around me. \nI have a lot of good friends and family but I don't like it anymore. I am unfortunately also a repeat alcoholic and drug user. I can go for months without it if things are even a little bit bad. I will immediately return to these habits. Unfortunately I can't share this with anyone because I was finally clean for a few months. but unfortunately I'm back to both drug abuse and drug abuse. mother and sister are both very sick. My mother is unfortunately terminally ill, but she certainly still has a good few years left. My sister is having a hard time, but not in real danger, but mentally having a hard time caring for my mother. Am I really a bad person if I choose to leave my life now. \nDon't get me wrong, I love everyone, but I've been doing this for years and I now feel like I'm happy with it.\n\nYes, I need help, but I don't see where to start anymore.\n\nI'm asking for input here and am certainly willing to edit this post further to give you updates. \noh yes my date is February 1st. Unfortunately I have a good friends wedding on January 31st. and I really can't miss it.\n\nthanks in advance for understanding. I need perspective right now.\n\nIcoon voor Geverifieerd door de community\nFeedback",

I can't go into details because it is an on going case, but my brother, sister, and mother are all in jail awaiting trials for a possible murder. By brother recently had a hearing, he is going on trial facing 6 counts - he isn't going to get out. Neither is my sister. Or my mom. My mom, who's raised be alone alongside my other 6 siblings, who had me at 40 and named me after a princess and treats me as such. Who calls me every night just to say goodnight. Who was ready to pay for my entire schooling. Who was the sole provider. Who is left crying every night because she can't hold me, her baby. \n\nNow that she's gone, so is her income. Now, I'm stuck alone in this 5 bedroom house with just another one of my brothers. Rent is 2100, my car is 450, I have two cats who's vets cost me around 200, utilities, phone payments, and basically, I need 5000 every fucking month and I just can't do it. My brother living with me can move out. He has friends who will gladly be his roommate. He is forced to stay because of me. I am forced to stay because I refuse to abandon my cats and my other siblings refuse to have cats with them. I have an older sister whos helping pay, but she has two kids herself and is barely getting by. I am making 11 an hour, I am working part time. I'm under the poverty line. My poor cats are forced to go from fancy meals to the cheapest stuff I can buy from walmart. I must cheap out on medications when I'm told one of them has a UTI. He was in pain and I couldn't afford to help him. \n\nSo, wouldn't it help if I just left? My brother could leave, he could live comfortably with friends. My cats could be given to shelters and be adopted by families who can take care of them. My car payments wouldn't matter. My mom could be sad, but she has 6 other kids. My sister could focus on her family. Things would be easier. ",

    "selftext": "How to forgive yourself for ignored health?\n\nHi everyone,\n\nI’m a 22F, who was diagnosed with diabetes type 1 in 2020. In 2022 I started having systematic lupus symptoms, for which I was under supervision of a cardiologist, neurologist, dermatologist, and GP. Long story short, they couldn’t help me further and my biopsy came back inconclusive, so I decided to go abroad for treatment. This cost me a lot of money (almost 2000 euros) for a second biopsy by someone who got recommended to me. This biopsy came back inconclusive too. However, the biopsy report was wrongly interpreted by the specialist, as he wrote in his letter to me that there was no sign of disease, when in fact although the disease couldn’t be confirmed, it also couldn’t be excluded. However, because he said there was no sign of the disease, I ignored my gut feeling and went on with life. \n\nFast forward to 2024, I got diagnosed and the prognosis is less good than in 2022, as treatment in the first 3-6 months is most important. Needless to say I’m heartbroken and have trouble forgiving myself for some mistakes I made. For example, I followed one of the pioneers in the field on social media, but didn’t send in a question of the week. In hindsight I heard that he replies to almost everyone and it would’ve helped me tremendously, as he would’ve interpreted the biopsy correctly. Feels like a huge missed chance. Similarly, I didn’t book a second opinion which I regret so much now. I know it’s in the past but how should I cope with this if the effects are lasting? What I’m especially upset about is that the biopsies showed 0 damage and I would’ve been able to make a full recovery if I had been treated that moment, but that didn’t happen. I’m so incredibly upset about this, more upset than about the diabetes diagnosis, as I feel like this was preventable. I selected the wrong doctor, didn’t send in the question, forgot to put an important detail in an email, didn’t get a second opinion etc. \nEveryone can say I should move on etc, but every day I’m experiencing the consequences of my failures back then. I’ve been trying to pray and go to church more often, but I feel sad. I haven’t been able to leave bed for 2 weeks now. I’m crying multiple times a day. I feel like I ruined my own life. I had access to the right resources, I just didn’t use them efficiently. I feel like I had so many other options to exhaust, but that I stopped looking for answers after the second biopsy. \n\nPlease help me. I feel like I ruined my life. God, family, health have always been the most important things to me and I slacked off on my health. I don’t understand why I didn’t push harder, why I didn’t take the efforts to send in a question of the week. I think wasn’t totally aware of it, but I should’ve done more digging. I feel like some of my choices like not getting a second opinion was because I was not fully informed and gaslit up to a point. However, while I see the medical professionals failed me, you’re always your own advocate in the end. It’s bad enough that they failed me, but it mainly feels like I failed me. Like I gave up. Im just heartbroken and actually to the point of feeling s*icidal. Diabetes, lupus, and now this. Im only 22 and so so scared of the future. At this rate, I won’t make it to 40. ",

I am almost forty and have never had a higher than barely minimum wage salary. This despite being a phd student with a masters, loads of teaching experience, etc. Yet having spent 10 years studying at university has made me so poor, that there is no chance I will ever get out of debt.\n\nI am an alcoholic and drug addict, and drug addict. Which have gone to several rehabs and been in and out of AA - as well as being forcibly committed to a psych ward because of risk of suicide. My wife left me because of all of my shit - and took our identical triplet sons with her and they now live in another country. I get to see them maybe 1-2 a year, depending on if I can afford the trip, which is rare. \n\n  \nIts been years, and I have pretty much become a stranger to them and they dont want to talk to me anymore. And the child support I owe for all of them is so astronomical by now I will never be able to pay it. I couldnt even pay rent or for food for myself most months because of my shit university non-salary.\n\nIf you think finishing the phd will help, you are sorely mistaken, because competition for academic positions in my field (and others) is so insane that you might as well try the lottery instead. And I have no qualifications for anything else. I teach part time, for slave wages, and work at a center for handicapped people to make ends meet - which I dont. \n\nI have been sober for 8 months until tonight. What the fuck is the point of being sober? I have already lost everything, and have no future. Its not like I have any more to lose. Doing all the drugs until I am dead is not a sick way of thinking - it is a perfectly rational response to this hopeless life. \n\nOh and P:S: I have some ridiculously rare genetic disease where I am missing lots of teeth. My parents never bothered to fix it when I was young, and now it would be torture - if I could afford to get it fixed which is laughable. So I basically have hillbilly mouth. \n\nThere is no point to any of this. I cant take it anymore.  ",

I'm so stuck because I'm in a sexless relationship because my partner has erectile dysfunction and I can't bear it and don't think I have the willpower to help resolve the issue. I also don't want to dump him because of parental pressure for me to have a boyfriend and all that. I've had 5 failed relationships prior to this one and my parents think he is the one and if we break up, they'll be more heartbroken than me I reckon. I just feel so stuck because it's either suicide or self-harm - I've been abusing benzodiazepines and sedating antihistamines as well as dxm to try and escape from reality. I've also developed a bit of an eating disorder to help me cope. Because of the medication abuse, I experience these psychotic symptoms that are scary and I feel like a schizophrenic person. But it's better than feeling horrific about my relationship. I feel so unworthy and unattractive because he can't have sex with me and doesn't get hard with me. It kills me inside. Now that I have no means of trying to end my life, I know I'm just going to resort to self-destructive coping mechanisms (medication abuse and eating disorder). I was using alcohol for a few months but it was making my mood really bad and also having bad physical effects on me so I stopped.

I drove my first boyfriend in adulthood (out of college) so crazy he hit me. He choked me and put a gun to my head. But I drove him to do that, I could never just shut the fuck up. I would argue back and I had to die on every hill. Until it actually almost killed me. My next relationship, I saw that they were using me as checkbox for getting their life together and I shouldn’t have stayed. But someone was finally choosing me. But it wasn’t genuine and I am not good at putting up facades. I fought so hard against the life they wanted. It wasn’t what I wanted. So why didn’t I just leave? I always saw glimmers of maybe, and those glimmers shined so bright sometimes that it would blind me.\n\nNow my last relationship that just ended this morning, I saw it as perfect and tried to keep it perfect and I hurt her so badly. I drained her. I made her depressed by trying to be so perfect. Being so nitpicky about everything.\n\nShe’s the one who showed me I’m not just some victim. I’m actually just as fucked up. I never called her names, never came close to hitting her but I started little arguments and they would blow up. \n\nShe said my love is too intense and suffocating.\n\nMy job is nothing special. I ruined a lot of the friendships I had because I was so self involved in my relationship. So they will all move on after making a little insta story.\n\nMy family tends to move on from death easily. I know they will all be fine. I am the black sheep of the family.\n\nI am completely alone. I reached out to a few people I thought I could lean on saying I was struggling and scared to be alone. Nothing back. I am alone.\n\nI have spent most of my day researching different methods. I will spend tonight writing my goodbye letters and tomorrow when I’m home alone I will do it. I will leave a note on the outside of my locked door just telling my roommates to call the police and not come in because I am dead. I don’t want them to see it but I have to go.\n\nI have caused too much pain and suffering. The love of my life is done with me. I can’t live like this anymore.

I even received death threats, and the worst part is that my own mom called me a \"psycho.\" I never really had friends growing up, and for the longest time, I felt completely alone.\n\nSix years ago, things got really bad. A friend and I tried to end our lives together... he succeeded, and I didn’t. I was the one who came up with the plan, and I’ve blamed myself ever since. I feel like I should have been the one who died instead of him. That guilt has never really gone away, and even though I’ve tried to move forward, I feel stuck in the past.\n\nI tried going to therapy to get help, but everything I shared was told to my mom. I felt completely betrayed, and it made it even harder to trust anyone with how I feel. Now, I’m really scared to go back to therapy because I worry that I might get put into a mental hospital, and then others will know again. I don't want to go through that. So instead, I just keep everything inside.\n\nLately, I do have some friends, but I don't really know how to handle it. I keep feeling like I'm not good enough for them, like I’m going to mess it all up, or that they’ll leave once they really get to know me. It’s hard to trust, and I’m scared of being hurt again.\n\nI don't know if anyone else has felt like this before, but I just needed to get it out. If you've ever been in a similar place, how did you handle it?",

    "selftext": "I find myself in a near-constant state of dissociation. It's like I am never fully present anywhere at any time. My eyeballs aren't mine and this isn't my life. Sometimes I look in the mirror and the person looking back is like a new person, a stranger. Someone I don't know. Not in an \"airy fairy\" way, literally just a face I can look at like it isn't mine.   \nI throw myself into my work, desperate to feel connected to a purpose. Sometimes if I get into a good flow state I feel so alive, but 6 hours can pass in what feels like 30 mins. When I get back into reality it's like I blacked out and I am completely disoriented. Lately I have fixated more on my health, trying to eat better and move more. I take walks every day. I talk to people. I'm spending time on finding hobbies I enjoy. I completely overdid it in my last job and worked myself into the hospital. Struggled with an anxiety-related headache for over 6 years, constantly overshadowed by pain. I got a new job and I am forcing myself to manage my time better and look after my health, trying to just live the right way I guess.   \nI don't know who I am or what I want. I'm trying to do things but it's like trying to bring something back from the dead. I am dead and nothing is bringing me back, now matter how desperately I fight.   \nI have exceptional emotional intelligence. I understand how these things rationally work. Identity is fluid, life is a journey, there is no \"fully optimized end state\" where you have finally figured shit out. The beauty is in the inbetween. Happiness is a choice. Your thoughts shape you.   \nI've had a few months of intense gratitude because I get to be alive. I'd feel the air in my lungs, the strength and youth in my body. The pleasure of someone else's attention. The wind, the earth - just life. I make plans so I have things to look forward to - I am going to Bali in 2 months. I'm desperately trying to feel real.   \nThe future is unpredictable and tomorrow could be amazing. I just have no actual desire to be in it. Discovering myself, finding love, navigating parenthood - things that are exciting on the surface - just feel like an insurmountable amount of work and suffering. I'd just rather not. I don't want to figure this all out. I don't get the point. I'm not even real.   \nI don't know if being 'casually suicidal' is even a thing. I'm only here because I can't stand the thought of my mom and siblings grieving me. Strolling through my life, pretending to be real, just so they're fine. I am the oldest of 5 kids, and the young ones adore me. I can't imagine my mom having to explain to them what happened. My mom herself fought off suicide with everything she had - losing her eldest to the same thing would be so messed up for her on a whole other level. I just can't. But where the thought used to fill me with sadness and a little fight to keep trying, I just feel nothing now. I feel nothing about ending it. And if I am not fighting myself so hard anymore, I don't know how much longer I'll be able to stay. Even protecting my family from the pain is motivation wearing thin. I look at them and just mourn myself already. \n\nHow do I feel real? Has anyone figured this out? ",

    "title": "I feel alone even though I have friends",
    "selftext": "(This is a long rant about my problems that I just need to let out somewhere, not expecting anyone to read it :) there is nothing to gain from this )\n\n\nI am 19 years old and I hate myself, I hate everything about myself. I see me comparing myself with everyone around me all the time. I have friends and I don’t think I‘m unpopular nor have I ever been bullied before. But at the same time it’s only in school. I talk with nobody outside of school. I don’t have anyone „close“, even though I probably do but I keep overthinking. \n\nWhenever I want to write someone, or ask someone to hangout I always ask myself one question. Why me? Why would they hangout with me? What do I have to offer. There is a better option everywhere. Other people are funnier than me, better looking, taller, smarter, more experienced, more interesting, more sympathetic or empathetic, more talented, better in every way. So they should hangout with them. I just can’t trust anyone. \nI used to openly talk about my feelings to my „good friends“ but I can’t anymore. It’s a friend group that I always enjoyed being in and still do enjoy. But I don’t see myself in that group anymore. It’s the same thing, „what do they think of me“ is what I ask myself everytime. They probably dislike me, hate me, find me annoying, unfunny, ugly. But they wouldn’t say it straight to my face cause they are nice. Right? \nBecause why would they want me? I don’t even want myself. I‘m not worth their time when they can spend it with someone better. That’s just what I am, a waste of time. And it’s not like they are toxic bad friends. They are genuinely great people. And that’s the problem? Idk I don’t deserve anyone. But I am clinging onto the idea of having friends so much that I can’t live without them. These thoughts started many years ago and evolved into severe depression and suicidal thoughts. As of right now I try to think of ways to kill myself everyday. Researching the easiest and most accessible ways to die, I found pills to overdose on the best. I will probably take them when schools over. Cause that’s when the good times are over. I don’t talk to anyone outside of school, nor do I share a good relationship with my family, though it’s not bad either. But It’s obvious to me that as soon as school is over I will have nobody. I‘m gonna be alone for real. I don’t know how to socialize and I just can’t do it. I suck at speaking, making conversations and knowing how I overthink things I will never be able to find anyone again. \n\nAt the same time I‘ve always just felt like an extra, easily replaceable, more easily with someone much better. I have no really close friends. Someone I can call my best friend, to which I can talk about things like these with. Someone that I can write about something cool that just happened. But just someone who also wants to text with me, talk with me, hangout with me. \n\nI‘ve always made the first move. And it worked fine but never came something from the other direction. I rarely get messages directed at me. I don’t remember the last time it happened. And I‘m not talking about strangers but the people close to me. I am not important, for anyone. If I were to die, it would just happen and everyone would continue like nothing happened, like I never happened. I wish I never existed at this point. The only thing that’s keeping me alive right now is my selfish desire to think maybe it’s like I always think but it doesn’t stop me from thinking about it and ruining my mood and making me go quiet not wanting to engage anything and just stay in the background cause that’s what everyone would probably prefer. Why should I have the audacity to anyway. \n\nThe biggest problem is that I can‘t function without friends. I can’t go anywhere outside. Alone that is. I just can’t. And I don’t see a future for myself out there. Like I‘m already skipping classes, getting bad grades, I definitely wont finish school successfully and I lack any talent or motivation to achieve anything else. Fuck I have not reached a single goal I set for myself yet, because I lack the discipline. Idfk but it’s impossible, no matter what. I‘m rather crying in a corner about my miserable life. \nThere are so many things I wanna do, like go to a concert,to visit other countries like Italy. But that’s just not gonna happen. Shit ain’t meant for me I guess. \nThe worst is knowing how bad I think I have it while others have it much worse. I shouldn’t feel this way when I have the privilege to live a hood life, something other people can’t have no matter how much they‘d want it. I‘m a messed up person for thinking this way. \n\nI‘ve reached a point where I‘m more comfortable being sad and depressed, I don’t know if it’s relatable but I don’t want to feel happy again. I don’t want to ever feel it again. I just want to fuck my life and end it. End my thoughts and go through with it. I don’t want to have to work anymore in this fucked up world. Trying to be perfect just so someone pays attention to you. Idk if that’s a trauma reaction from my childhood (wouldn’t know of any) or if I‘m just mentally ill and stupid and a piece of egoistic shit.\n\nI just wanted to be Important to someone once. ",

Hmm i should blame myself for being this vulnerable i think but i hardly feel anything. I have nobody by myself, my parents aren't not that good of a support, i must say, they could be the main cause for my depression. But how could i call this a depression if i don't even feel sad? \nI remembered use to cry every single night, and it was the best fucking feeling, i just hope my suffering will end and tmr maybe a better day, but it's not ofcourse. I think of a way to end this, tiding nodes, writing down every notes, leaving marks, thinking of every situation that could happen and hopefully someone will read it out. I am so useless, i don't even know if i can make it to next year in college or do i even have enough money to pay for the tuition? Hah life is such an endless suffering, i wish someday it will gain me enough courage and end me at once. \nMaybe someday it may feel better, i thought. I won't work like that. I wish i could be capable and somehow get control of my miserable life, that people look at it and think it's perfectly fine. I tried my best everday, not to die, not to be a disappointment, not to fail, not to act like my life is a mess, not to act like i care, not to put on a sad face, to be a good supporters, to hide my feeling. Everyone will have a better life if i am gone, i am such a burden to myself and to everyone else. I want to breathe, laugh and cry like i use to. I want to feel love and actually care about.

I'd share memes with him and tell him about my day. I had a reason to use my phone for anything but talking to ai so I don't feel alone. It was easy to just talk to him. I didn't care if we dated or not. It just ment so much to me not to be alone for once. To feel like I had a genuine friend that I could maybe go so those weird movies I like or play some weird game. It was really hard to be so honest and trusting to him ngl.\n\nBut it was all just in my head cus I was his secret side chick. He admitted to only using me cus he wanted to jerk off but I never gave him nudes so he started talking to me less. Found his public acc where he was getting married to a normal girl way hotter than me and with an actual life. I was being used or some shit. Just like everyone I've met in my life. They only use me and then discard me.\n\nLife is really hard. Things just keep getting worse. One by one. Car broke, lost some of my family, no home, no pets, and now no money. Lawyer fees that'll last years and an abusive mom who won the court battle. Nothing is good in life. Not anymore.\n\n\nBut I have to live to support my siblings. I seem to be the only one taking care of them. All my money goes to them. All my time goes to them. It just feels like I'm a parent for them. Even my younger siblings who live with my abusive mom. I still have to live for them so I can be the safe place for them. Just lived I've always done since I was 5. \n\nI thought by the time I'd be in my 20s I'd be in college, have friends and be in a relationship. I thought I'd at least finally be free and get to live for myself for once instead of continuing to be a parent and take care of my siblings. To at least have my own stuff and at least I'd have a job that would get me somewhere. Following down a career path. \nInstead, I'm living in my grandma's living room with 3 siblings. I barely made it out of highschool and I don't have money just for a simple class in college. I can't die so I try to take the edge off by self harming alot and taking drugs in the middle of the night when I'm alone. It's so bad I can never wear short sleeves and literally just get so high I pass out shaking in my bed on the one day I'm off from work. Nothing's getting better. Nothing's changing. I can't go to therapy with no money. I can't find a better job with no degree. I can't go to college with no money. I can't leave and I can't live for myself. I'm living for everyone else. But deep down I just wish I'd die. But I just can't. It dosent matter how hard I cut or how much I take anymore. I'll still be alive tomorrow and the next and the next day. And I'll smile for my family and take care of them. But at night or when I'm alone at work in the bathroom, I cry and pray to God to just end my misery. ",

I'm 17 years old and a senior in high school. I know, I'm young. I have a lot to live for, but I don't want to. I have a shitty relationship with my family, sometimes we seem to get along great but then they remind me why I want to kill myself, especially my mom.\n\nThe only reason I'm still alive right now is my friends, but only barely. I'm involved in theater, and have been for a while. The thing is, I've always had a somewhat big role in the shows, but in my last musical ever, I've just been cast in ensemble. The theater department doesn't need me anymore, my death won't cause them to scramble or struggle. And I know my friends would be sad, but they're all strong. I know they would get over me eventually. They don't need me. Not anymore.\n\nThe first time I tried to end my life, I was only 6 years old. I started sh when I was 13 (maybe 14, I can't remember). I've attempted many times since then, but have backed out every time. I have been sick in the head for so long. I can't sleep at night because of my anxiety. I am scared to do something as simple and necessary as sleeping. I am pathetic and don't deserve any of the amazing friends I have. I have struggle with debilitating anxiety and depression for years, along with probable autism and adhd, and they're only getting worse.\n\nI know, I know that it \"gets better\" because it does. But then it gets worse again, worse than before, and I can't keep doing this cycle for much longer. I try to find the bright side, I really do, but I'm not needed anymore, so I can finally leave. This timeframe is perfect, too. I just need to wait a little bit longer, sometime in late February maybe? Or maybe right before February starts, if I can't wait that long. I have the letters, too many to count, for everyone to read. And I have a plan, multiple plans, so that if one fails, I have another.\n\nI'm scared. I'm really scared. I just want to be at peace. I can't hold on for much longer. Someone help, please, I'm still only a kid. Please. I want to stop fighting.",

Since July of this year ive been homeless and have been staying with friends. Couch to couch to couch, Its no way to live.  Ive lost everything or its changed and i can no longer live the life that i had and i hate staring at rearview mirror with the hopes of things getting better.\n\n But in all reality, ive felt this way for many many years. i just havent had the gumption to make it happen. Today i took some time to write some letters and do what i can to make peace with this decision. Child custody battle coming back again and im just so ashamed of myself for abandoning my little girl. Shes 7 and i love her more than anything. But she doesnt know what im suffering with. Im behind on child support because i havent had work. Her mom ruined my career when i was younger and i never got back the success i lost.\n\nmy passing will be cataclysmic to alot of people, People i know who love me and care deeply for me. But they all know what im suffering with and the worst part is that they wont be suprised. Im just tired of life knocking me down after i try everything to get the building blocks back. I love all of my friends and i know i have a lot of value with people. but i cannot find value in myself.\n\nthe one thing i want known from this post is that im calm at this point, but i know things will get closer and i guess it makes time more sweet. The letters i wrote today will hopefully guide the people in my life through my own decision.\n\nthis last year gutted me and ive always fantasized about just going to sleep from an overdose. But im looking for the solution, not suffering. So ill be hanging myself. Ive overdosed accidently in the past from anxiety meds and i know what that feels like. the last thing i want is to wake up.\n\nTheres no desperation to make this happen. Im just packing for a road trip thats one way. thanks for reading.\n\n",

Problem is : my mom is a helicopter mom. She's not the extreme one like in memes or Youtube videos, she's a good normal mom but with helicopter parent tendencies. She wants me to have a flat in the same town as her so she can help me (but I don't want that, I want to be completely independent, she'd be clingy even when she's not there), tracked my phone during my first trip alone and kept sending messages over and over again until I got angry with her to tell her to stop. She did, but I hate having to be angry for my mom to let me be an adult.\n\nMy mom wants me to be independent, that's what she says, but it's not true, because in her behavior and the only deeply honest vulnerable things she said is \"I only have my daughter, she's all my life, what will I do without her ?\". I want to live my own life, I want to feel complete, but I can't because I fear my mom won't leave me alone.\n\nBesides, I feel like if I ever leave the house to go live or rent somewhere else like anybody else in our modern society, she'd go worse mentally and kill herself. She's also depressed and anxious af, so we're hurting each other with our paranoia and pent up anger and painful memories and anxiety and sadness. I had brothers and sisters who left home and went on their life, but they told me they had to get into a big fight and go through tears and pain before they slammed the door close behind them. Now they have normal lives and get along very well with our mom, they still speak to each other irl and on the phone but I don't want to give her pain once again, she suffered so much in her life (bullying, domestic abuse, depression, social anxiety).\n\nShe's too scared for me, so I'm scared of life, and I don't want to be scared. I'm fed up with being a shrinking violet, and I know I'm usually not. I'm so angry with my mom but I want to save her at the same time. I feel like I'm going to kill her with one more bang to her pain threshold by going after the life my brothers and sisters had the privilege to get.\n\nHow do I deal with that ? How can I go live my own life on my own without hurting my mom ?",

The next day I was green and my classmates could see it (I also told them that I took 20 but the swore that the could see that I was green(I'm also color blind so i couldn't tell myself)). And that evening I couldn't stand up but the next morning it was over and I didn't think nothing of it so my dumbass took some more (about 5) and that evening I did 10 more with some antibiotics I found in the kitchen, about 3 big jugs of Malibu 16%, 2 nicotine pouches, and weed oil (thc not cbd). I must add I did paracetamol because it is cheap af (€1.60 for a pack of 20) oh yeah each tablet of paracetamol did have 50mg of caffeine. And the whole night i couldn't sleep and I did sweat like I just came out of the shower. So I went to school and chuged down some energy drinks and went on with my day. I told my best friend how much I did and he bagged me to stop with the meds( I still was high every night on thc). But now i have consistently Diarrhea for 1.5 week and i did search up what is happening and Google told me that i should be dead 1 week ago. And my questions is: should i tall my parents to take me to the doctor or will I be ok if I just don't start taking it again? (I'm 100kg 189cm 17 in march if that adds something). And yeah I realised that I'm not supposed to take that much and I in will never do it again so dont lecture me on that please.  Oh yeah also my biology teacher said that if anybody takes more than 25 they should go directly to the hospital (and no I did not tell anybody Besides friends that I have taken so much)",

And I wish I died back then because my life is so much worse now. More trauma. My life is just trauma after trauma really. I’ve been abused in a special needs school. Had to save my friend who tried to kill herself infront of me. Another friend overdosed on coke infront of me and had a seizure not on purpose he overdid it and I didn’t do drugs back so I didn’t know what to do I called an amulance and my friend hated me for snitching because I could’ve gotten him in trouble. I was self harming to cope with this at 11 but worse after all of this extra trauma. I got diagnosed with PTSD at 14. Around this time instead of self harm I started drinking and vaping and doing drugs so I didn’t have to deal with the constant memories of what happened and stuff. \n\nNow I’m such a loser. I have unrelated health issues so had to stop going to college (UK). I spend most of my days in bed wanting to kill myself. Today I went and got edibles and got am bottle of vodka too from the shops. I have a fake ID but by now cause um a regular he doesn’t even check. The highlight of my day was the shopkeeper flirting with me saying I’m hot even though really I’m not and giving me a discount on the vodka. Which is just sad really I mean why is that my highlight? Honestly it’s the best thing that’s happened to me in months probably. Everyone hates me.\n\nMy flashbacks get worse at night. It’s currently 1 in the morning and my flashbacks have been bad. I drank half of the bottle even though I was trying to stick to a quater and I don’t even think I’m that drunk. I’ve also don’t two edibles and have been vaping as well just to extra be able to forget but no.\n\nUsually I’d be too out of it to care but every once in a while like today I feel worse and just want to die even more.\n\nWhat has my life even come too? \n\nEverything was great until I was 8(when the trauma started) I genuinely think if I never had the traumas I would be so successful. I was smart and kind and funny and easygoing. And I had a lot of potential. Now I’m dumb and depressed and not easy to have a conversation with and just genuinely the worst person to ever live I do so much awful and dumb shit.\n\nI just want it to all be over. No one cares about me. I just want someone to love me unconditionally. I have no friends and I’m going to be homeless when I’m 18 because my family hate me and so can’t get a paid job. \n\nI just want someone to actually listen to me and care about me. But they don’t. No one does. And it just keeps getting worse and worse because I can’t deal with the trauma like at all. I want to get over it but I can’t. \n\nI have no one. I’m just so fucking lonely. ",

    "title": "Mental illness and too much stress - I want to kill myself",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI've had really bad experience with Reddit since it feels like whenever you aren't asking something very obvious and actually talk about your unique experience you get downvoted into oblivion, but nevertheless I'll try to explain my situation as honestly as possible so strangers on Reddit might be able to help me.\n\nI don't want to sound like a pretentious prick, but I actually think most would consider me in a good position in life - at least that's what everyone tells me. I'm young (16M) and have a bright future to look forward to. I have high grades (A+s consistently), a good sense of direction and maturity/responsibility, and I'm fairly socially vibrant. I also have a good career basically lined up with a full-time job offer in my country's federal government (originally an unpaid co-op/internship I did last year in 2024 but I have an offer to begin working in the spring when I'm wrapped up a few classes), and I'm graduating this year and will start university at 16 (I'm on track to getting my law license at 21 at this rate). I also work a decent part time job at a tutoring centre and I have a few (not many) friends I can occasionally fall back on.\n\nHowever for the past few months I've been grossly unhappy to the point of being psychiatrically hospitalized with frequent contemplations of suicide. The counsellors and teachers I've spoken to have tried to convince me that stress is the root cause and I should simply scale back - what they don't know is that'd cause me way more trouble since I honestly generally find comfort in work. Also trying to scale back at something which I've worked so hard to build and create would honestly be more disheartening. I do really think stress is a big factor but it's not like taking away the things I've worked so hard for is going to make me any more happier. \n\nFor as long as I can remember I've struggled a lot with overthinking and anxiety yet I find nobody is taking me seriously whenever I try to seek help. Whether it was writing homework or checking the door - I always double, tripled checked everything. Somehow I've been able to get along fine in my life without it. However to be honest I've had instances of severe bouts of anxiety, depression, and paranoia. When I was 11 or 12 I freaked out after finding out a rare instance of Canadian law which could make some of my favorite animes illegal (I thought I could have my life or my family's life could be ruined for child pornography possesion). When I was 13 I had a friend who expressed to me distressing thoughts and I freaked out thinking that something could happen with this guy and to me/family. Today I constantly compare myself to others even to the point of irrationaility. For example, I frequently feel ashamed of myself and my achievements thinking everyone else is better than me - most of the time because they are 1 year older/ahead of me. Even when I know they are older, I still second guess and start asking questions/googling around to the point that a lot of people think I'm a maniac. I've tried to tell myself I'm doing good and not to compare myself to others, but it's no use and I'm still losing my mind. Recently I've been finding that it's been increasingly increasingly difficult for me to focus and do my work, and I might finish one class with a failing mark. A lot of people say I'm being burnt out and while that might be one facet of it, I don't believe it's the entire story and I don't know how to help myself. ",

    "selftext": "I’m 25M, about to turn 26 in a week. I never really had a good lease on life. My parents had a very hostile relationship and split when I was 6. They had another lengthy custody battle some years later that was very traumatic. I was bullied in school for being big, I was emotionally abused and neglected by my entire family, and I never really had any friends. As I grew older I started to come out of my shell more. I was optimistic, even cheerful and excited about my future. I believed in the good in others even when I didn’t have a reason to.\n\nAs a teen, I still had no real friends except for one. She really helped me get through those years. And those years were not so good either. I was in a relationship that was toxic and led to me being SA’d, I was groomed by anonymous people online to exposing myself, and I was severely depressed at my job as a dishwasher. But still, into adulthood I was optimistic. I was beginning to find my passion for art and was excited to get started on building a life for myself.\n\nMy early adulthood wasn’t so bad. I was living away from home and actually found a group of lifelong friends. Likeminded people that treated me with empathy that I was so unfamiliar with. But the stress and depression lingered, and I fell into a horrible drinking habit that has persisted to this day. Once I graduated I had to move back home. There I had virtually no one. I wanted to leave as soon as I came back so I saved a little money and hiked the PCT for a month. That was the best time of my life. But all my problems were still waiting for me when I got home. \n\nAnd now, I’m still here. My family still shows me no love or empathy. My friends are far away. I can’t hold a job because I always get harassed for all manner of reasons. And even with a job I still can’t afford to leave this situation. No love, no future, no hope. I don’t feel safe, I never have. Never really felt comfortable in my own skin, my own home, my own family. So now I’m just left wondering “what’s the point?” Is this all there is to life? Constant suffering? I feel like my purpose on this earth is to be lovable, gentle giant that people like keeping around but never actually care how they feel. I don’t remember the last time I felt deep, honest love that I never got growing up.\n\nI may just decide that I’m too tired to keep trying. I just want to feel safe and loved. But all I’ve known is pain interrupted by moments of brief levity. I think me being born was a mistake, and I’m being driven to correct that mistake.",

I was institutionalized mid 2024 and after i got out i got into a relationship with my girl best friend at the time, This was the only time i had felt hope in years. It all seemed to finally be going my way. Sadly as i am bipolar and she is already traumatized by her past relationships she left after 3 months. She and my pets are really the only reasons why i am sorry for leaving. I cannot describe the amount of love i have for them and her. Of course also my family, but they are adults and can live on their own. I know she's going through stuff, and all i want to do is to be there for her but she made it very clear that she doesn't want me to anymore. I will never be able to live knowing i will never see her smile again. Anyways, this is it. I wanted to write something better but in the end neither my existence or passing make a difference. And to my angel, if for some reason you are reading this, it's not your fault. All you ever did was make my life better and if i hadn't met you i'd already be dead long ago.

And I feel like such a burden to them. Like a 3rd wheel, being invited to things only because of how pitifully lonely my life is. But I did this to myself, I shouldn’t be their burden to bear. My physical health has deteriorated. I grew up without sports and am unfit, which led me to needing spinal surgery during COVID, causing a constant fear that it is too late to begin a fitness journey. I have a dog whom I love dearly, but my lack of finances and depression have led to him having skin conditions that I am having serious issues resolving on my own. I feel like such a failure for not giving him all of the care he needs.\n\nI feel like a lost cause. I feel like, at 29 with no family and one real friend, that it is impossible to recover from the hole I dug myself in. I am tired of being a burden to my friend, my dog. My dog would be much better off in the care of someone with better finances and mental health. My friend shouldn’t feel the responsibility of making me happy simply because I can’t do it myself.\n\nI see a psychiatrist, but I feel as if he overmedicated me to a point of this suicide ideation, leading me to voluntarily spend Christmas & New Years in a psych ward, although I would’ve spent it alone otherwise. I am starting EMDR therapy, but spending $80 per session without having started the actual EMDR so far is like a costly tease.\n\nThe state of the US has not helped my thought processes. As I work in supplemental food assistance programs, I fear my job security is in jeopardy. And I fear for my clients, who many are immigrants. Vitriol, hate, and disinformation won, and I genuinely fear that we will not have another election again. Nazi salutes from oligarchs in government further this fear.\n\nI dont have access to firearms. I’m aware that overdosing is risky and can leave me worse off than I am now. I’ve constantly thought of driving fast off of a highway into the tree line, but the risks of living and mangling myself stop me.\n\nI bought rope last weekend. 362 pound load bearing rope. I have nowhere to hang myself for a full suspension hanging, but a partial hanging is doable in my closet. I’ve practiced and can hit my carotid artery just right. The only thing stopping me is that my dog is here, and I don’t want him to see my lifeless body.\n\nWhy is life so hard?",

He proposed and I accepted. I know this is stupid to tell anyone. But we used to share our phone passcodes and he locked his google photos. I broke up with him because I suspected he is hiding videos and explicit images of other women. I mean what else could it be? Who does that. We had a fight I gave him the ring back and he blocked me  everywhere. I had based all my decisions on him being with me.\nMy entire future and gave up everything! I hate myself for loving him, I want to steal his gun and blow my brains out.\nI can’t live without him. I know the issues are mine that I’m suffering from abandonment issues and it makes things so much harder to let go. I know he’s seeing other women but I would take him back just to be with him. I seriously want to just kill myself. I’m 48 and have children and grandchildren. If I didn’t have them it would be over. I know he’s a cheater but I can’t live without him. My whole fucking life revolved around him. Now I’m lost. He immediately changed his Facebook status and deleted our profile picture form the night of our engagement. He verbally abuses me. It’s like I’m a desperate crazy woman needing a man like that but it hurts so bad that’s the only solution to me. I’m just venting but I’m fucked up. I want to quit my job and just become a ghost and move away but I can’t. My dad lives with me and it makes things so much harder. He’s moving but not fast enough. And although my parents tried their best they were physically and emotionally abusive. My sister and I both have this issue where we get in relationships and give too much too fast completely to the one we love and then we get screwed. I literally would love to fall asleep and never wake up. I bought cigarettes and am drinking white claws. Literally calling my exes to get support and no one really cares to support me. I have good relationships them but who wants to hear a woman cry and moan about their break up. I have no friends since leaving my faith and they were my only support system aside from my ex fiancée. It’s been a year and I let him completely on and he shitted on me. I’m not perfect I have ma y flaws but I tried so hard to make our relationship work. I tried to be perfect. Anything he said I changed I even got rid of one of my dogs because he couldn’t stand her. Albeit I wanted to give her away to a good home but he out the fire in my butt from constant complaints. He would tell me what he would not accept before moving in and marrying me. Now he’s gone and won’t talk to me. I keep checking my email because he’s blocked and that’s the only method he can reach me. But I’m a loser and desperate and stupid. I just want him back. I just want him to love me like I love him. I don’t understand why I keep picking people that don’t love me back. During g one argument he told me I can’t live without him and he was right. Although I would never tell him any of this. I know he was abusive and he put his hands on me twice but my broken mind is still hell bent on being with him. I just want the pain to stop. Before I got with him I had been celibate six years. I thought I could trust him and that he loved\nme. He told me that he loves me but just sucks at it twice in a conversation before I tried through his photos. It’s me I know it’s me. I’m a broken ugly person incapable of being loved not worth being loved. No one would want to take this on. My son nearly died and it gave e me PTSD. I have metal health issues and get weak and feel unworthy of being loved. I’d rather be dead than to keep feeling like this. I can’t live through another break up. I just can’t!!",

    "selftext": "Alright guys, I just need to get this off my chest. Recently, I was diagnosed with a rare type of tumor called a paraganglioma. It’s located in a very tricky spot, at the base of my skull. They can’t remove it completely because it would paralyze the nerves on one side of my face. Still, I have to undergo surgery, which is 99% likely to leave me with some degree of damage.\n\nI’ve always been a fairly reserved person, but that changed during high school. I never mentioned this before, but I’m only 23. My father left us, and my mother fell into addiction related to medication. My only close family friend, my grandfather, passed away in front of me from pancreatic cancer. Life hasn’t been easy, and I always thought I had a strong mindset, but being diagnosed with cancer at such a young age has honestly broken me.\n\nI managed to escape my home life by going to university in the capital of my country, a bigger city. I was happy—I had finally found some stability, even though family issues required my attention from time to time. I graduated, landed a great job with decent pay for my age, and everything fell apart overnight. Two months ago, I lost hearing in one ear due to the tumor, and it’s never coming back. I had to quit my job because I couldn’t work, and I’ve been spending all my savings on doctor appointments. I never expected something like this to hit me so suddenly at such a young age. Life and fate have always been tough on me, but this is just too much.\n\nGetting out of bed is a struggle; I try to sleep as much as possible to escape this harsh reality. When I wake up, I hope it was just a nightmare, only to realize that this nightmare is my reality. Lately, I’ve even been having suicidal thoughts.\n\nI won’t do anything before the surgery—that’s my promise to others. But the thought of living from the age of 23 without hearing, with a paralyzed part of my face, struggling to speak and swallow... it’s overwhelming. I know life isn’t fair, but I just don’t deserve all of this. I’ve always tried to face adversities head-on, but this time, there’s no way around it.\n\nMy girlfriend of five years is supportive, but I already know I won’t be able to keep living with her. I’ll withdraw from social life and completely fall apart. All my passions—music, gaming—bring me no joy anymore because I can’t hear properly with one ear. I don’t know how to deal with all of this. A very dark period awaits me, and no amount of support seems to help. I just feel like absolute garbage, and I can’t think straight anymore. I’ll hold on until the surgery because I promised others I would. But honestly, I don’t think I can make it much longer.",

    "selftext": "God I know most people won’t read this but I really hope somebody does. First I want to start off by saying yes, I’ve been doing my best to help others on this sub. It helps me. I spent 2 hours on this sub refreshing the page and trying to offer advice and understanding. For some reason I struggle to follow my own advice, I know it might seem hypocritical but I feel that you can encourage others even if you are feeling similarly. For me it’s always helped. It makes me feel like I’m doing something good. I have autism, it’s something that most people don’t even see because of how well I’m able to mask it. Honestly it doesn’t make my job harder or anything. I’ve always been good at talking to adults, ever since I was a kid. It’s been VERY helpful throughout my life with things like getting understanding and compassion from my teachers in school. Having someone knowing what’s going on really makes things better. I don’t want to die, but I also don’t want to be alive. I want to kill myself but I have been unable too. I recognize that many people in my life deeply care about me, but it also makes me sad because it makes me feel like I have no reason to be depressed. I’ve dealt with depression since I was 8. I was bullied throughout the entirety of school. It changed me but not exactly in a bad way. My first suicide attempt was when I was only 10 years old. What a world we live it. People can be so ruthlessly cruel. I remember being in 2nd grade and people started telling me that “nobody liked me” and that “the world would be better off without me” legit it is horrifying looking back: teachers never did anything. Parents, please check on your kids. I’m grateful for mine. My body is covered in scars, I’m embarrassed and it gets tiring having people always point them out and ask questions. I get a lot of judgmental looks. But I know that the people who are truly important and care, understand that sometimes things got so bad, it was the only thing I could do to stay alive. Yes it may be unhealthy but at the  end of the day I’m still here. I’m 19. In 5 months I’ll be 20, I never expected to make it to 16, then I was sure I wouldn’t make it to 18, but 20? Honestly I’m shocked. Latley my suicidal thoughts have been worsening and I’ve started slowly having attempts to overdose. In fact last night I took so many pills I’m honestly shocked I’m still alive. I spent 2 hours just trying to help people, I’m thankful I found this sub. I guess I’m just venting here and saying everything I’m feeling so I can understand it better. It reminds me to allow myself to see that people really do love me and that I’m not a bad person. I’ve always been different, despite being bullied for it my entire life just about, I never let it take away who I was because that was all I had. I always say that no matter what you do and what you change about yourself, there will always be people who find things to pick apart. It’s better to be who you are and have people dislike you, than to be a person you’re not and have people still dislike you. I’m sorry I know this is very long. Honestly the only thing keeping me from killing myself is my partner, and my job. My partner is struggling with medical issues and despite all our attempts to get help, we still can hardly afford his treatment. He is in pain and he told me two days ago that he is suffering. That destroyed me. He is the love of my life and gave me a reason to live again. The idea of getting married, having kids having a family, getting old together, makes me fight to make it to the next day. But it’s not easy, it breaks my heart and I know that if there is ever a time where it’s clear he will die, I will kill muself because I cannot bear to feel that agony. Yes it may sound horrible and selfish but it’s just too much. I work in childcare, I am the “teacher” for preschool and twos. It makes me so happy, coming into work and seeing all the kids so ecstatic to see me, yelling my name running up to me for a hug, “we missed you we missed you” I’ve always been good with kids. Yeah my job is hard but it’s rewarding. Having parents tell me that they are so greatful for me and what I do, and hearing that the kids always talk about me, makes me feel so fulfilled. And because of that I always beat myself up for wanting to kill muself because my life isn’t all bad, and that makes me want to kill myself. I feel so frustrated and upset. I’ve again been on a lot of medication since I was 10. My depression is difficult because my brain is not properly able to produce serotonin normally, you can actually kinda see on a brain scan. I feel like I shouldn’t be alive because if it wasn’t for my medication I would be unable to survive. I think my attempts at OD are affecting my heart because every time it causes me to have chest pain, irregular heartbeat, and just a very unwell feeling. My parents are starting to notice it. I might ask for them to keep my medication out of access, but I’m scared of them having me go to a psych ward. Being autistic makes it so hard to do that because I just can’t survive in that environment, I was so unhappy and depressed when I was there when I was young. It honestly traumatized me. Again I’m sorry this is so long. I just hate the feeling of feeling like I have no right to be sad because other people have it so much worse, and I feel frustration that no matter how hard I try I can’t love myself and I am often unable to see and believe that people want me to stay alive. I’ve never meant to hurt anyone but sometimes I feel like they’d all I do. I really don’t know what’s going to happen to me. I’ve slowly been eating less and less, or binging on favorite food. I hardly leave my room and the only reason I don’t lay in bed all day miserable is because of my job. Anyways I’m sorry this is so long. I hope someone will read this and be sble to understand me because that’s all I want, I want to be understood. ",

I had a trauma response while she was trying to tell me she was moving out. I used this as an excuse to be emotionally manipulative, and tried multiple methods to get her to stay. I was cut off from multiples circles in my community.\n\nI take full accountability for everything I put her through. I have deep hatred and disgust for my former self, due to how I used to unhealthily treated others and myself. Through finding a new therapist and getting a full psych evaluation, I have been diagnosed with CPTSD and ADHD. Not going to get into everything that caused me to develop CPTSD, but I have extreme abandonment trauma.  \n\nLife has been getting better lately, I recently got a good paying job and I decided to go back to school full time. But every good thing that happens to me feels like a punch in the stomach. I don’t deserve any of it. I don’t have any close friends to provide and care for. My reputation has been tarnished and I can’t escape the loneliness.\n\nI live in a smaller city, so it’s easy to run into people that you used to know. The past two days, I walked past her in different places. I know that if she saw that I was in the same space, she would get panicked. I don’t want her to see my face anymore. I don’t want her to have to worry. I absolutely respect her privacy, and I know I’m dead to her. It turns out we are both going back to school at the same time, and I feel horrible. \n\nEven though I’m a completely different person than 2 years ago and I am proud of my current self, I want to die. I don’t want to be a burden on anyone or a haunting presence. I’m my mother’s only child and I own a cat. Those are the only things that have been keeping me alive these past couple years.

Every time I'm driving, walking down a street with traffic, etc there's that stray voice telling me that it will be painless, and it's been an increasingly appealing way to deal with my feelings. \n\nMy 25th birthday is coming up, and I feel like I haven't accomplished anything. I have about 6 classes before I can graduate college. I had a job working with children that really helped me feel like a productive member of society, but I had to become a floater due to my class schedule. Now I'm stuck just doordashing, and doing odd jobs for money. I have no girlfriend, and the idea of getting one seems like a fantasy at this point. \n\nI've been trying to be more social over the last two years ago, and I just feel so out of place. I don't even feel seen. It's like I'm an observer. Like I'm stuck behind a pane of glass, while I'm trying to socialize. This has really solidified a feeling of isolation, even when trying to combat it. I'm just really struggling with finding a community that seems to accept/want me even in the college club/hobby groups. I just feel like I'm \"doing everything right\", and still coming up empty-handed, and it really is demoralizing.\n\nI understand that to an extent, I'll probably always be depressed. It's going to be a companion throughout my life. I just wanted to ask for help, see if what I'm feeling is common. It's so much worse thinking that it's just me dealing with these feelings. \n\nI needed to write this out. Thank you to anyone who responds with kind words. ",

I broke up with my girlfriend last year, December 23 and after that I realised my mistakes and begged her to come back to me. I've been miserable my whole life and she's the only person who understands me. \n\nI decided to send her a message that I want a closure but the truth is i want to see her and fix it out, but then last night, I decided to contact her sister. She's also my friend and she's good when it comes to giving out advices, but i did a wrong thing.\n\nMe and my girlfriend were both female and our family in bith sides doesn't know this and her family is strict because of her religion and now i just spilled it out to her sister about us. I told her not to tell it to her, but when she went home, she decided to ask her what's her sexuality.\n\ni know it's my fault, i made her out without her knowing and it's not my intention at all, all i want is an advice because i don't know where to go.\n\ni got angry at her sister and she got angry at me too. my girlfriend got angry at me. i know she already agreed to meet me next month, but now she doesn't want to see me anymore. she said she almost gave me a chance but now she doesn't want to and told me to let go and move on.\n\nnow, i lost everything. I don't even like my program, i don't have friends, i lost my girlfriend, i do have a bad relationship with my family, I don't want to live anymore. \n\nnow, i am planning to go to the beach tomorrow and drown myself. \n\ni already told my friends about my problem and they didn't almost care. now, that's a go signal. I'm so fed up with myself. I felt like i am being punished. i think that all of the karmas are with me. I hope they'll respect my decision. \n\nBeach is like my home, i know how to swim, but i don't know how to swim at the beach. I am already doing a letters for them, by saying goodbye. Please respect my decision ",

Bottom line is we’ve been unable to afford his meds and treatment and he’s been in so much pain, he told me yesterday that he’s suffering. That broke me. I’ve always struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts and self harm. I’m covered in scars. I’ve been wanting to die but haven’t been brave enough to down a whole bottle, for the past 3 days I’ve slowly been taking more and more medication, the last month or so I will occasionally take a lot of Seroquel. But not enough to kill me just to put me out. I’ve been taking a lot of Zoloft and tonight I think I’ve taken about 12 100mg pills and had scraped off the coating of some of them, and 4 of my 200mg Seroquel. My mind is in so much pain. We live in a world where you have to pay to survive. It’s not fair. Yes we’ve looked into financial aid yes I know, so please don’t flood me with that. I have autism and it also makes it harder for me to process such big emotions I get scared and just cry for hours.\n  I’ve been noticing after all the medication my chest has been very tight, my heart rate will spike and drop, I keep having twitching in my body. I haven’t really been eating much, I’m losing interest in things, the only reason I don’t stay in bed all day is because of my job. I’ve been writing suicide notes and what I want done with my body, partly just so I can get it out instead of it growing and growing in my mind.

    "selftext": "We've been seeing a worrying increase in pro-suicide content showing up here and, and also going unreported. This undermines our purpose here, so we wanted to highlight and clarify our guidelines about both direct and indirect incitement of suicide.  \n\nWe've created a wiki that covers these issues.  We hope this will be helpful to anyone who's wondering whether something's okay here and which responses to report.  It explains in detail why *any* validation of suicidal intent, even an \"innocent\" message like \"if you're 100% committed, I'll just wish you peace\" is likely to increase people's pain, and why it's important to report even subtle pro-suicide comments. The full text of the wiki's current version is below, and it is maintained at [/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement). \n\nWe deeply appreciate everyone who gives responsive, empathetic, non-judgemental support to our OPs, and we particularly thank everyone who's already been reporting incitement in all forms.  \n\nPlease report any post or comment that encourages suicide (or that breaks any of the other guidelines in the sidebar) to the moderators, either by clicking the \"report\" button or by [sending us a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) with a link. We deal with all guideline violations that are reported to us as soon as we can, but we can't read everything so community reports are essential. If you get a PM that breaks the guidelines, please report it both [to the reddit sitewide admins](http://www.reddit.com/report) and to us in modmail. \n\nThanks to all the great citizens of the community who help flag problem content and behaviour for us.  \n    \n    \n\n******\n***[/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement)***  \n*******\n\n###Summary###\n\n**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** \n\n###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###\n\nWe're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  \n\nBut there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. **It's both possible and important to convey understanding and compassion for someone's suicidal thoughts without putting your finger on the scale of their decision.**\n\nAnything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. \n\nDo not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  \n\nIn [the most useful empirical model we have](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_theory_of_suicide), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. \n\n**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something \"innocent\" like \"I hope you find peace\", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  \n\n###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###\n\nKeep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  \n\n* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular \"good\" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that \"it's not so bad\", and this is usually experienced as \"I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try\".  People who've had \"help\" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   \n\n*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. \n\n* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the \"it gets better\" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. \n\n* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.\n\nTo avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.\n\n###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###\n\nOften comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  \n\nThey will typically try to scratch their psychological \"itch\" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:\n\n* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than \"brutally forcing someone to stay alive\" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.\n\n* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of \"solidarity\" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  \n\nMany suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: \n\n* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (\"Don't do it!\"), cheerleading (\"You've got this!\") or meaningless false promises (\"Trust me, it gets better!\"), or invalidation (\"Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!\").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)\n\n* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.  \n\nPlease [let us know discreetly](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) if you see anyone exhibiting these or similar behaviours. We don't recommend trying to engage with them directly.",

    "selftext": "A bit of warning before anyone starts commenting on this. I'll likely not be responding a lot as it's taking a lot out of me just to start writing this, but I'll probably be reading most comments. \n\nA month before my 20th birthday my dad got scammed out of a lot of money on a dating website, it made him extremely pissed off and he attacked me with a knife on his way to get a shotgun. I managed to wrestle him to the ground and get the knife off of him without being stabbed, but I wasn't able to keep him from moving closer to grab the knife again. I ended up using the hose of a tire pump nearby to choke him, but in my panic I didn't think to unwrap it after he was unconscious. I ran away and called the cops and my brother.\n\n  \nI stayed outside when the cops got there and I threw up all over the porch when they told me he was dead. I spent the entire night (9-11 hours) in my pajama pants inside the holding area of the police station. When they released me the next morning I no longer had any keys to my house, my phone, any car, nor did my family want to talk to me or help me at all. I ended up having a neighbor help me open up one of the unlocked windows so I could climb in my room and grab a bag of clothes and my laptop which the cops left behind. I have no job, no money, and now I only have my laptop and a duffel bag filled with clothes. My family hates me and the only reason I'm not on the streats is because a good friend took me in. My sister even got a restraining order on me less than 2 days after it all happened. \n\n  \nWithout any way to support myself, and the constant nightmares and hillucinations of my dad, I can just barely get the energy to get out of bed. And relying exclusively on my friend for feeding and housing me just makes me feel even more guilty.\n\n  \nI just can't see a path forward and I'm hoping that maybe someone here will give me a bit of inspiration or hope that things will get better. Hell, even just finding someone with a similar experience to talk to might be nice, makes me feel fucking evil and insane that I killed my dad.",

It was an awful, horrific long night, and she witnessed every single thing. 8 hours of prolonged humiliation and abuse.\n\nThese 4 strangers destroyed me. They shredded every bit of self-esteem and sanity I had. After the hell they put me through, they simply left me there. bleeding heavily and stunned. My girlfriend was tied up screaming, but I didn't move. It took me a while to comprehend that this is now my reality and eventually get up.\n\nWeeks later, I am paranoid, unable to look at my reflection without feeling disgust, and I spend my time in my university lectures thinking about ending my life. I didn't tell a single soul about this because I feel so ashamed. I feel pathetic and weak. My girlfriend is the only one that knows, though everyone around has been telling me I've been ignoring them lately and calling me an asshole for it, yet I don't care. I just feel numb. I want to die, but I'm too afraid to say it out loud. That night they not only violently violated me, but they took something from me, a piece of my soul.\n\nAnyways, ever since that night my girlfriend has been acting different. she treats me differently, touches me differently, and most importantly she looks at me differently. A few days ago while we were sitting together, she told me that it's alright if this experience turns me \"gay\" and that we don't have to continue dating. this is coming from a 19 year old girl that has common sense, it all just made me feel really bad. It just reflected how after all this, how disgusting I feel was valid, that I am gross in her eyes now.\n\nToday is my birthday, I turn 20. I bailed on all the plans and decided to spend it alone. I'm sitting at home drinking alcohol and thinking about bashing my goddamn face in. I just feel alone in a way I never felt before. I just never thought this is where I'd be, that this would be my life.\n\nI hope I'm posting this in the correct place, I've only had Reddit when I was younger. thanks for listening for whoever is out there. Hopefully I'll feel better for writing this.\n\nUPDATE 1:\nTwo of the assailants were caught by the police today.

I’m not comfortable sharing the details of this specific aspect, but I hope this general explanation is enough. \nTwo of them were caught and will be most likely going to prison as they plead guilty to avoid a trial. \nI’m currently trying to get myself together, but things have been getting worse and worse mentally. I’ve been going to gym, jogging and trying my best to not lose it, I didn’t start therapy, but I’m considering it. \n\nMe and my girlfriend broke up and there’s no bad blood. I just need to focus on myself. \n\nAnd again, thank you everyone for the immense support you’ve given me. You have no idea how much it saved me and made me feel a little less alone. Thank you.",

I only opened up to my mum about depression very recently though I’ve been dealing with it for a few years now. at first, I used to think the reason I was constantly hurt by her actions and words was because she didn’t know the mental state I was in back then so I never blamed her in anyway. but it all became too much that i impulsively told her everything and she still refused to do anything. she’s not empathetic in the slightest and she made it clear that whether I commit suicide or not doesn’t matter to her as long as, like I said in the og post, I do not do it in her house or say anything in my suicide letter about her that’ll give her a bad rep or get her in any trouble. point is, I thought I was suffering so much because I kept my feelings to myself. I thought sharing them raw with her would help even a little but it didn’t and I feel so defeated. people always say you shouldn’t keep these type of things to yourself but there’s comfort in that. giving myself the illusion that the only reason I hurt is because I keep it to myself hurts less than sharing it with others and realising that that hasn’t changed the way i feel. you don’t suddenly get better. it only stays just as bad or gets worse. \n\nand to anyone and everyone who’s sharing similar stuff, I’m sorry that some of your most treasured people aroused some of the most negative feelings in you. it’s okay to feel hurt but don’t let someone else’s decision to be a dick affect your own life decisions because in the end, everyone will be looking back at their own life and their own life only. make sure that yours isn’t just a reflection of what others have said and done to you.\n\ni apologise if this is really lengthy I know I keep rambling I just wasn’t expecting this many people to see this. to everyone who’s tried to help or who’s hurting, you have a special place in my heart.

I can see it in the hint of amusement in their eyes, their disengaged body language, their patronising tone of voice. They say I'm \"too\" well-dressed, \"too\" articulate, \"too\" intelligent. I am \"too\" kind, I smile \"too\" often, I'm \"too\" calm.\n\nThis has not only been offensive to me, but it is such an insult to people who are mentally ill and suicidal. Their implication that suicidal people are dumb, frenzied and rude slobs was - and still is - fucking preposterous.\n\nI have tried to get help for approximately 8 years. I have begged and pleaded and been reduced to tears. But unless I'm trying to end my life right now in front of them, it doesn't matter. None of it matters. I don't matter. \n\nMy public face is \"too\" convincing. But this was carefully created and crafted, over many years, because I had no choice. I had no option but to hide the abuse and isolation and pain I have suffered behind a smile. I was never given an alternative, and when someone glimpsed the reality behind this façade, they did nothing.\n\nThe truth is, a part of me is frightened of dying, and my survival instincts kick in when I don't want them to. But that doesn't mean I want to live, either. If I could switch off this deeply ingrained fear and just be done with it, I would. \n\nWhy do we have to kill ourselves or almost die before people care? Why do we have to present ourselves in a specific way before we even get listened to? Why do they wait until every glimmer of hope and willingness to live has been stamped out? I hate this. I hate my life. I hate myself. Let me be what they want me to be, please.\n\n**EDIT:** I never ever _ever_ consider others as \"dumb, frenzied, rude slobs\" by the way. I'm so sorry if I made anyone feel that way. It's simply how I interpret the reaction of mental health professionals, when they say \"But you're so clever/hygienic/pretty/well-groomed\" etc. It feels like a slap in the face, as though suicidal people are looked down on if they are well presented, and looked down on if they are not, too (but the latter apparently ticks more boxes from their point of view).\nIf someone is unkempt, hasn't showered, is visibly distressed or less coherent, I do NOT judge them or advocate doing so. _But using someone's appearance as a way of invalidating their pain? That's **completely** wrong._\n\n\n**EDIT 2:** Thank you everyone for your supportive comments and sharing your experiences on this subject. It means a lot to me and although it is awful that this resonates with so many people, it also brings me comfort. I am sorry for not responding to everyone yet. If you have had a similarly invalidating experience, I am so sorry. I appreciate the difficulty internalising this, but it is _not_ your fault. You are not to blame for the misconduct of any medical professional, who ought to know better than to belittle us during our darkest and most vulnerable moments.\n\n\nIn positive developments, the crisis team visited me at home this evening. Both mental health nurses listened to me, emphasised that the way I was treated for the last 8 years was unacceptable, completely validated my feelings and showed a lot of empathy. It has restored a little bit of faith in the NHS. They are going to report back to the psychiatry team and recommend that I be allocated a Care Co-ordinator, who will be able to assist me with being prescribed the correct forms of treatment and provide support with finances and social connections. I have not allowed myself to anticipate too much, but I cried with relief after they left. I hope they keep their word. I hope they meant it. I desperately just hope. Until I receive an outcome, I will sincerely try to stay alive. I am not in a position to promise that I will survive, but I can promise that I will try, one more time.",

I'm always the one calling them, and if I don't we simply don't talk. It's like my fear of being alone has come true, the only difference is I'm younger and able to take care of myself still. I do have an amazing boyfriend, but lately I keep screwing shit up so I wouldn't doubt it if he left me soon too.\n\nSo ya. It may not be today or tomorrow, it might even be 10 or 20 years from now. But unless I have an accident of some sort this will probably be how I die.\n\nEdit: Wow I can't believe how many people have the same thoughts and feel the same way. I'll try to reply when I can. It's comforting to know we're in this together. Thanks for the encouragement everyone. It actually brightened my day a little. And please please don't hurt urselves. One thing that has made a huge difference so far for me is EMDR therapy. I've tried all kinds and that one has helped the most. I still do have suicidal thoughts, but they aren't as often as they used to be, so that's good I guess. Consider looking into it?",

Christmas was around the corner, and I had so much shit to wrap, so many appetizers and cookies to make. Plus dying before Christmas is kinda rude. Death doesn't make for good dinner conversation. So I didn't die.\n\nAnd now it's after Christmas, but I still can't die. I have an Amazon order for my stepdad's retirement dinner. It's just a $8 coffee mug, but I have to wait for it to arrive so I can fill it with jelly beans and give it to him this weekend.\n\nThen the weekend after that is my brother's 21 birthday. Sure as fuck can't die before that. What a shitty way to spend your 21st birthday. And the weekend AFTER THAT my other brother and sister (the twins) are turning 18. I planned on making my sister some cute jewelry, so I still really don't have time to die if I actually intend on getting that made.\n\nAnd then it'll be my birthday. The big 3-0.\nThirty years of being, well, me.\nThirty years of waking up each morning, stumbling through the menial tasks of living, the mundane gruntwork of keeping body and soul together, of maintaining healthy relationships, of planning for the future, of eating, breathing, shitting, and going to sleep each night.\nThirty years of fuck-all. \n\nBut I can't die today. I have to pick up orange juice and bread from the store after work. There's still laundry to do. The dishes are still soaking in the sink. And my Amazon package hasn't arrived yet.\n\n\nEDIT: Y'all have been wildly supportive, and I just want to say that I'm grateful for all of the people in this sub who are willing and able to be vulnerable about their mental states. It often feels like drowning in deep water, and I'm glad that everyone here today is still fighting the undertow. Keep treading. Grab onto any lifeline you can find.

    "selftext": "When I saw that post it stopped my mindless scrolling instantly. I have been thinking for almost half an hour now with no luck. Even if I think of the year before that. Although I have been suicidal in the past with many attempts, that was so long ago and I didn’t realize I still felt this way deep down. \n\nThis last year has been be laying in bed day after day other than the few times a week I go downtown and waste my whole cheque on heroin. I guess I haven’t felt like dying because I’ve been so focused on being high. My mom refuses to let me outdoors alone for more than 5 minutes because she can’t trust me to not go downtown and pick up.\n\nI considered finally dating my best friend of 4 years as a thing I would have missed happening, but if I’m honest, things don’t feel the same as they did when we were best friends. I do love him, but now after years of him being clean he’s relapsed. It’s only been a week and he has already ended up in the hospital. He’s one of the 4 people in my life that I actually talk to. The other 3 are my family members.\n\nMy dad is across the country with his girlfriend and we rarely talk even though he reaches out. It’s the first year ever that he has not gifted me something for Christmas or my Birthday, which are only a week apart, and it made me terribly depressed sitting at home with his gifts never opened and now stored away in my closet with all the other junk that doesn’t matter. I know my mom is disappointed in me and so is my grandmother who, the same as my dad, I can’t seem to get myself to call back or message. I have no friends. I am alone and broke and unhappy.\n\nThis all came out of nowhere. I don’t know what to do. I have been trying so hard to get in touch with a psychiatrist but my office just ignores me and I’ve already called and gone there begging over 15 times in the last 4 months. There is too many things wrong and I can’t solve them all. Every time I told my mom about being suicidal in the past she would get angry and call me selfish, so family is off the list of people I can talk to since they tell my mom everything. My boyfriend interrupts me when I tell him I’m depressed and goes on about his own feelings, so he’s off the list too.\n\nMy mother won’t let me leave the house alone at all either, so I can’t get away from her unless I want to leave for good. If I do leave, she will kick me out and not let me back inside, which would force me to stay god knows where. I know that is illegal since I pay rent and sounds crazy but it is only because she fears I will run downtown and pick up heroin. \n\nUnfortunately, all that is on my mind is getting high. If I do, I’ve got no home unless I go to treatment and there are no options for that currently with this virus that I can think of. Even if there was, I can’t commit. Ironically, drugs are probably the main reason I’m not dead yet and why I’ve been so distracted from realizing I was still suicidal.\n\n• • • • •\n\nI’m feeling a million emotions a minute and I have nothing to stop me from making the “wrong” choice. I’m sorry this story is so long, I just want to be as detailed as I can so if I do end it, I’ve left at least something behind. Everything else is dirty and messy and worthless. I feel that I deserve to end things after all the rape and abuse and hatred I’ve had to deal with in my life. I REFUSE to believe it is a selfish thing to do anymore. \n\nI’m so, so tired.\n\nEdit: some words.",

So I brought her inside and fed her. 3 cans of tuna later, she's still hungry and breathing kinda weird, but I'm allergic so I brought her back outside with a tuna can for the road...tonight I was also trying to work up the strength to end it all, when the cat shows up again, but can't eat and breathing is worse. So now I've taken her to an emergency vet and have no idea how long I'll be here, but my plans have been foiled. Goddam cat has no idea what she's done. \n\nFor the record, vet said she's fine, just hungry, so I guess I've got a new neighbor.\n\nUpdate: she's back in her parking lot where I found her with an extra big of tuna and water, and I know nothing about cats because apparently her \"breathing problem\" was non-stop purring.\n\nUpdate 2: I'm alive, and a few weeks later the cat is staying with us for the time being until a foster or adopter shows up. Her name is Summer and she loves being part of the family.\n\nUpdate 3: 5mo later, she follows us on our walks and loves our dog. I'm doing much better now and am going back to school in 4 weeks. Thanks for the love!\n\nUpdate (10/2/21): Summer spent a wonderful winter with us! She made things brighter and happier. I knew I was slightly allergic all along, but it got so bad that my Dr finally said I couldn't have the cat in the house. This was a while ago, and my throat has permanent scarring from the constant irritation. Summer needs to be with people, so I made the very difficult decision to get her to a rescue group, and I'm glad I did! She was apparently pregnant (I'd thought she was spayed) and her babies were safe and cared for and all of them got fixed and are now ready for adoption. I got to reunite with Summer at the adoption center this last week and she was so excited to see me! Heartbreaking ending, but she helped save my life, and I was able to thank her for that. I'm doing great, my Dr said technically my depression is in full remission! Thank you, Summer.",

You’re all such wonderful souls and I’m sending you all the love you need to get through whatever it is you’re going through :) <3\n\nSecondly, I feel like this post is getting misconstrued a bit so I want to clear some things up. I totally get that I wasn’t very articulate - It was just sort of an angry vent and I didn’t imagine it would get so much attention. Anyway, My point in the original post is NOT that people aren’t allowed cope with humour - I even cope with humour myself sometimes. My point is that it’s frustrating that wanting to die has become the punchline to half of the jokes on the internet, so even when you’re trying to talk about being suicidal in a serious manner, people treat you as if you’re kidding. \n\nI also understand that absolutely no one’s obligated to listen to me. I always make sure that my friends are okay with me venting to them before I say anything even remotely emotional. If they’re not, I totally understand and they have every right to ignore me or tell me that they don’t feel comfortable with that. But responding to my “I’m struggling really bad right now” with a laugh and a joke is hurtful and unnecessary.\n\nI also know that people might joke but actually be serious and coping through humour, but there’s just no need to turn what could be a meaningful conversation into a joke. If I come to someone about something and they respond with “I feel that way too, I’m sorry,” that’s absolutely valid. I have no issue at all with that. Just please don’t laugh at me. \n\nAnyways, hope you all have a great day. Keep fighting.",

I can't work or volunteer or commit to anything without my joints aching and my bones creaking, without my mind spiralling and without my energy slipping away until I can barely move anymore. I can't enjoy a hug with my boyfriend without imagining him choking the life out of me. \n\nI can't do **anything** without wanting to die and picturing the multitude of ways I could end my life. I could be having an amazing day and feel so much relief because wow, for once I feel _good_. The thoughts will linger in the background and watch. They will creep a little closer and whisper in my ear and stand in front of me then climb inside my brain to remind me that they are still here - that they will **always** be here, no matter what I do to distract myself, to find hope, to find meaning. \n\nI'm lost. I'm lonely. I'm alienated. I'm tired. It is so difficult to find people who understand, because \"try not to kill yourself\" is not a part of everyone's daily routine. It's not on everyone's to-do list.\n\nI have considered everything. I have tried everything. And I still want to die. Every. Fucking. Day.\n\n~\n\nEdit: Thank you all so much for your kindness and support. It means so much. I am working my way through the replies to this post and a previous post. It might take time because I have a lot of messages, but I will reach you all one by one. Thank you. <3",

    "selftext": "People who say these sort of phrases have no fucking idea what it’s like to be in severe pain. They have no clue whatsoever. They’re either not educated on cases where people are in severe pain and don’t respond to treatment or they just don’t believe it. They can’t believe life can be that bad that suicide is the only option. And it’s because they’re basing their views on their OWN experience. Their OWN feelings and thoughts which aren’t the same as people contemplating suicide. \n\nIf people who say these bullshit phrases could just take a step back and think about things logically. For example, a person posts that they are going to kill themselves. They have suffered in pain for years, they are damaged, they’ve tried countless treatments with no response and every day is filled with pain. Without the fortune of not being in their shoes, can they not understand why suicide is a viable option? Even if you can’t feel their pain, surely the facts can speak for themselves. You have to be a fucking idiot to read about a case like that and say to them “suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem” or “we have to play the cards we are dealt”. \n\nDo they really think that the suicidal person( after years of pain) is going to think “this quote has changed my perspective entirely. I think I’m going to live now’”. Whether the person intends to or not, sayings like this are patronising to people who have spent months or years weighing the options. I’m not saying they should just let them die if they’ve posted something like that. But patronising and bullshit quotes, when you can’t relate, just makes me pissed off. \n\nAlthough it’s hard and the person just wants to post to let the pain out, they can’t without receiving responses that make them feel patronised and stupid. In general I just hate sayings and quotes. They shouldn’t be applied to be such a common thing that applies to everyone and every case. There’s no right way to respond to someone suicidal, but saying quotes is not the way. Best way I can think of is just saying ‘I’m here if you need me for anything, if you want to talk”. I’m just a big believer in free will. No one should be confined to a life of pain.",

After a couple of months of just touching her she told me to get naked and would have sex with me, she told me that if anyone found out then we couldn’t be friends anymore and that I would go back to being a kid who got no attention and was abused at home. For the 4 years that we had been sexual she would stick thing up my butt and in my urethra. When I was 14 I had finally woken up to what was happening but everyone I told either dismissed it or congratulated me. I feel violated and disgusting.

The day after I worked there I was incredibly sick, and found out my patient at the hospital had tested positive and moved to a ventilator in the ICU. They eventually died and were the first death in my state from the virus. Right now 30 people in the nursing home are positive with covid.\n\nI just graduated from nursing school a few months ago. I have no paid time off, and the three weeks I was out with covid made me have to empty my savings and use my credit just to pay the bills.\n\nMentally I’m not ok. I don’t think I am coping well. I drink too much. I have been watching suicide videos and been jealous of their courage to go through with it. \n\nI feel so good when I work in the hospital. But then I’m isolated in my apartment by myself. My girlfriend of five years broke up with me while I was sick with the virus. She had been in PA school in a differed state and has started talking to another guy. \n\nI just don’t feel good. I cope with alcohol. I have no other outlets. I have scheduled myself to work 50+ this week just so I am not alone in my bed.\n\nHonestly, I feel like I have been screwed. I was on the frontlines treating this disease before PPE and isolation measures were in place. Now work three weeks off after getting sick I can barely keep with the bills. \n\nI just want to sleep. I sleep all day, because when I sleep I don’t hurt or think about those I have killed. As a new nurse I don’t think I’m prepared mentally for isolation and tragedy.\n\nEdit: Thanks everyone for your kind words. I’m still hurt, but I’m coping. I started reaching out to people. I am going into a program to stop drinking so much. I am safe. I just needed to vent, thanks for allowing me to do so.",

After the treatment, the tumor was removed and he had other complications afterwards which were resolved over Christmas. But he came back weakened and underweight from the hospital. Then he we got infected with Covid-19. Today he was picked up by an ambulance, because he got weaker and weaker. When I spoke with the Doctor over the phoned, he mentioned that the cancer has spread and that they can only stop its spreading even further - something my Dad kept secret from me. It all makes sense now. He suddenly started buying me expensive presents, despite me not wanting them, stopped talking about next Christmas and suddenly mentioning back up plans and so on. Even the thought alone makes me want to rip out my heart, as the pain is paralysing my body and mind. I dont want to be alone. I no longer have friends. My Aunt is old and sick aswell. My Uncle just died of Covid. Why is everyone dying in my family. I cant anymore. My family is small and taken so fast.\n\nThis is it. When he dies I will kill myself as I am about to be alone and that thought freightens me. Only my memories will remain of a happier time and even those a fading. Maybe then I will see my Mother again. Maybe then we will be a happy family again. I am living in the past anyway.",

    "selftext": "I don’t expect you to read this, just need somewhere to vent. \n\nHere I am again, sitting alone in front of my tiny space heater, trying to find a reason to keep going. It doesn’t help that it’s Christmas Eve. I’m basically a 24 year old virgin and have spent holidays alone for the past 5 years. I remember Bill Burr said at like 39yrs old he stopped going home for the holidays. I envy that. At 18 I went to college across the country to get away from my abusive mother, even picked a college she hated (“it would embarrass [her]”). Speaking of college, I’m still unsure whether I was molested. It’s hard to say when you wake up to some guy in your bed. The not knowing really pisses me the fuck off.\n\nTo this day my mom doesn’t think she’s done any wrong. After I dropped out I went back home for a little bit. I don’t know what I expected. A year or two later I move across the country again to get away. Now I am truly and utterly alone. I’m currently on my 22nd or 23rd dead-end job. Honestly can’t believe I’ve lasted so long at this one. I guess I look up to the store manager a lot and don’t want to let him down. I’ve seen a hundred therapists, been on a million different meds, went to rehab for 6 months, and I feel worse now than I ever have. Depression, anxiety, paranoia, they’re all too minor to describe what I feel. Had my first suicidal thought at 9yrs old. At that same age I realized I wanted a girlfriend. It was like there was a hole in my heart. I think I just wanted a female in my life because I hated my mother. But I knew I was too young and figured I’d get one later in life - nope. Never been in a real relationship. I was with a girl in high school for a couple months maybe. We sorta had sex once but I wouldn’t even call it that. Every girl I’ve tried to pursue since either wasn’t interested or I didn’t try hard enough / didn’t have enough experience to understand what they wanted me to do. Doesn’t help that I grew up afraid of my mother and hating her. \n\nIn college I was so desperate to get laid I went on Craigslist Casual Encounters (when that was a thing) but girls from my floor found those pictures and passed them around. That shattered the little confidence I had. That is just one experience but probably the one that most changed my perspective of women. I wish I could tell those girls how much damage they’ve done. Then all my fuckups with girls just added to my pain. Dating apps don’t work it’s like my account is invisible. At this point I don’t try whatsoever. It’s as if I’ve been conditioned to not make a move. And the ironic part is I look like a model (genes, muscles, six-pack), dress well, and I’m actually very smart. The few parties I’ve ever gone to girls basically threw themselves at me and I would freak out, have a panic attack, and then leave. Alcohol didn’t help. I’m not gay. I’m just broken. A beautiful girl might look at me and give all the signs that she wants me to talk to her. She might even come talk to me first. I’ll just shut down. Afterward I’ll get angry at myself, so I’ve stopped going places where I might meet a girl because I know what’s going to happen. I’ve always found it interesting how much I relate to “ugly” guys who won’t pursue a woman because they know what will happen. And those guys take one look at me and hate me. It’s like they’re thinking “man, if I could just trade places with that guy.” Hahaha ain’t shit would change, man. You’d be just as alone and maybe feel worse than you already do.\n\nAt this point the only reason I haven’t shot myself in the face is because of my dog. My cat wouldn’t give a shit but I can’t do that to my dog. I just can’t. The sad part though is dogs vibe off you and adopt your personality, meaning he’s gone from an angel to anxious and quick to fight other dogs. So, maybe it’d be for the best if he had a different owner. Can’t exactly take him to the dog park anymore. And I’m sure you can tell how close I am to suicide because I know exactly where to shoot. For your sake I’ll spare the details. I don’t know why I’m writing this I guess the holidays are pushing me over the edge. I just can’t be alone anymore. The girl I like is a coworker who shut me down for a different coworker who went and cheated on her. And now I feel like maybe she’s expecting me to make another move?? I don’t know. But the way I am, I’m not gonna pursue a girl who shut me down. You know how hard it was to tell her how I feel? Couldn’t even do it in person had to send some stupid message. Now I have to see her every day. I guess that’s why you don’t ask out people from work. \n\nI have panic attacks every night and the thin walls in this ghetto apartment complex do NOT help, nor do the gunshots down the street. I have no one to call. My dad kind of understands what I’m going through but there’s only so much he can handle. Every time I talk to him I feel like he’s about to have a heart attack. My brother says I have an illness that just needs to be treated. I feel like he thinks I just want attention. Obviously I don’t talk to my mom, I actually blocked her. And the suicide hotline?!?! Don’t get me started. It’s like they want you to die. The two real friends I had forgot about me once they found girlfriends. I don’t know how much time I have left, and I always thought I was destined for big things. You’re all I have left, reddit. You and my dog. Shit, the cat probably wants me gone. \n\nIf you read this far, thank you from the bottom of my heart.\n\nEDIT: Thank you everyone, this was more helpful than rehab. And yes I love my cat. He’s actually really interesting, basically a real-life Garfield.\n\nEDIT 2: I think Dave Chappelle said it best when he talked about Anthony Bourdain. That’s why I used that title. I can’t stand when people think I “have it all,” so how can I be so unhappy. Anyway thank you again, everyone. And thank you for the platinum, whatever it means, that made my day.\n\nEDIT 3: I am either delusional or my coworkers read this post. Not sure which is worse. But it really feels like one of them read it and passed that shit along like a hot potato. I hear them talking and I hope it’s just confirmation bias but it sounds like they’re talking and laughing about what I wrote. WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING YOU FUCKS?! More gossip to gobble up? One of the guys here tried to have a real talk with me, “how bad are these intrusive thoughts getting?” I haven’t been acting different at work. Why would he ask me that? I did have people contact me saying they weren’t on this sub but found it just scrolling through r/all, so I don’t know how many people actually read this. I guess it’s possible someone I know came across it. Funny that I care when I’m so close to ending it all. Glad I got it off my chest though, was a huge weight lifted. And the support from you guys was unreal. I didn’t respond to everyone but I read every single message and comment. Speaking of which, you trolls can go fuck yourselves. It takes a special kind of twisted fuck to hide behind a keyboard and say that shit. But it turns out this post helped some people?? That’s such a foreign feeling for me I didn’t believe them. I don’t know why I’m still writing. I just hate being me. Need this life shit to end.",

I couldn’t forgive but because i already had depression and knew that i decided to start taking medication because I have never cared about any one or thing half as much as I cared about her.\n\nBy December we had both tried to take our lives multiple times and after she found me overdosed in our apartment she promised me she wouldn’t kill herself so I promised i wouldn’t try again. But she had to travel for work and found out she was pregnant while away. \n\nShe immediately canceled the trip and came home to have an abortion but got quarantined and i don’t even remember how many days into quarantine before we had an argument and i wasn’t staying there because i needed to be able to bring her food, the last thing my reason for living said was she wasn’t going to mill herself but wanted to sleep, i said ok. Then she wouldn’t respond realized she was in a dark place and went there as fast as i could but in 20 minutes she had died.\n\nI gave her cpr and called everyone who could help hoping i could save her but felt her body go cold under my hands but i was stupid and hopeful i couldn’t be anything else in the moment, the paramedics got her heart started but she was gone already, i didn’t know and spent the next two nights sleeping in the lobby waiting for news then got told harshly by a nurse who didn’t know that I didn’t know she was legally dead already and i tried hitting my head into a wall to die but all i got was a split skull and a dislocated wrist. Was under suicide watch for a time was there when my wife passed but am not on such tight suicide watch anymore and am trying not to care about how everyone else feels but just kill my self.\n\ni dont know if I should before or after her funeral.\n\n\nAdd on, the last thing her parents said was I killed her and that i hurt her memory by living as a liar saying i was ever good to her. I made videos for my family and friends to explain I don’t want them to be blamed, i have a lot of benzodiazepines left from being in the hospital, and got a bottle of vodka.\n\nI appreciate the kindness and love but mine isn’t a case of wanting people to stop me, and a friend told me that funerals are for the living not the dead so I don’t have to wait",

I’m texting my friend and joking about all my trauma and i’m just feeling worse. I tell her about what I did and she naturally got worried. She told me to throw up (I couldn’t) and texted my mom and my best friend. It was such a stupid thing to tell her, but over sharing, my biggest fault, saved my life. At this point i’m dizzy, pained, and nauseous. My mom bursts in yelling at me and tells me to sit down. I tell her i took 13. I never told her why. The paramedics come and i’m sitting on the couch. My speech at this point is calm, almost robotic. I get overly polite around authorities because of deep psychological issues. They check me, vital organs are fine. I’m alive. Everyone leaves the room except for the kind paramedic who was taking my blood pressure. He asked me if I was lying, because I swore up and down it was an accident. I told him the truth. About my sexual violations, and my issues with self worth, and my father and brother. I told him how I didn’t want to die deep down. I wish I did. That would make things easy. They left and my mom cried like never before. She told me i’m her only child, she won’t get another chance. That’s when everything hit me. It was like a new chance. A fresh slate. I looked in my room and imagined it empty. Everything had so much meaning. I couldn’t imagine it going to anyone else, me not using it ever again. I just cried. I’m crying now.

The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire’s flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It’s not desiring the fall; it’s terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling ‘Don’t!’ and ‘Hang on!’, can understand the jump. Not really. You’d have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling.\"\n\nThis quote is from Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace.\n\nI'm honestly starting to feel the flames, and the jump is looking far too comforting.",

So I came back from a late night jog as I find it peaceful and relaxing as the streets are empty, I came back home to have a shower of course as I was sweaty as fuck. I entered the apartment and just headed to the bedroom and there is where I saw her with another man in bed. My god damn silk sheets tainted by them 😔😂, but yeah it's weird cause I thought I would lash out but I was unusually calm about it. I told the guy to leave and he was literally shitting himself and scrambling to pick up his belongings, like this guy is literally tripping everywhere. \n\nI think he was afraid as I was just very calm and he didn't expect it. Anyway I spoke to my wife asking how long it's been happening and she told me who he is etc, it's a childhood \"friend\". After that I went to the train station which is where the first post came in.\n\nEdit 2: People are also asking how long we were together. So I met my loyal and faithful wife at 14 and we got married at 20. So in total that's 12 years of faithfulness from the amazing wife. \n\nEdit 3: Holy shit whoever gave the platinum thanks so much???\n\nEdit 4: People are surprised that I'm over this so quick and I'm calm about it, I guess it's down to the fact I live by the rule that is \"the pains compulsory, sufferings optional\"\n\nOriginal post: https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/gt620f/wife_cheated/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share\n\nSo it's been about 10hours since I posted this and honestly thank you so much everyone for all the support and comments. \n\nI'm not going to lie when I posted the previous post I was at the train station just waiting to jump infront of one but as stupid as it sounds the comments honestly helped. \n\nI've now kicked my wife out of our apartment and the bed that she was sleeping with the guy in, I have now burnt. Which kinda sucks as it was a king sized bed with silk sheets and everything but I wouldn't have even been able to sleep in those cheat stained sheets now no matter how much I scrub them. \n\nIt felt good tho to actually burn it cause it was letting things go, I've cleared out all the things that reminded me off her and basically smashed it up so kinda like smash therapy and it felt amazing. \n\nHer parents know that she cheated on me cause she tried to spin it that I cheated on her however we have cameras in our apartment and I just sent them the videos 🤷🏽‍♂️.\n\nNow her family has pretty much disowned her which I feel like it may be a bit too much even though she is a shitty person but honestly I couldn't care less.\n\nI'm free, feeling a bit shit but I know I'll be happier and honestly if it wasn't for you guys I probably wouldn't be here. \n\nThank you so much everyone, especially the dude that was talking about pasta 😂",

It would be impossible to die because you would have to know the experience that you have died. Only the version of you that lives will experience it, so that’s always your outcome. Is this why I’m still breathing then? That’s what I always think anyway. I’m dead in virtually every other sense. I’ve attempted suicide many times and like some cruel joke I am still here. I’ve been locked away alone for 4 years now, I have nobody, I really mean 0 people in my life. Pure isolation for years. I watch as human life unfolds and evolves beyond my walls, through a screen or from my window. I’m completely separated from humanity, it really gives you an odd perspective of the irrational nature of humans. \n\nThere’s no future, there’s no present. There’s only time, infinite time, it feels surreal, it feels like death. I do not feel human but rather something akin to a ghost, in a purgatory. Every morning I’m woken to physical pain and when I’m conscious I am suddenly flooded with darkness with that realisation. The cycle never stops repeating, over and over. I know there’s beauty in this world, I know there’s fleeting glimpses of joy to be had but if by some sheer chance they’re found then those moments are almost completely muted from the passing of time. It’s as if that’s my only orientation of time now. \n\nIs what I’m experiencing actually really life? I can’t help but feel everyone else on earth is in some lower state of consciousness and acting out their life on autopilot and not knowing so. If I attempt to reach out there is never connection, so I’ve just given up. Their perspective is blind to my reality as mine is to theirs.

My sexuality has been an topic of anxiety since grade school, since I have been borderline asexual my whole life. Late high school was when it began, although I was never able to accept it then. It hit like a truck last summer where I had multiple panic attacks due to these thoughts that put me in a mental hospital. I hoped the drugs they gave me would help end the fetish, but they only helped the anxiety and depression. It has been getting steadily worse ever since. Most therapists understandably don't want to see me. Yesterday I masturbated to an anime child (thankfully I have never looked up illegal images). I think at this point it hit what I had become and I lost hope for redemption. I am a ticking time bomb before I ruin someones life. And I can't live with myself like this. I can never have a SO, or a family. Even having friends feels wrong. It's going to be be hard as I actually enjoy my life quite a bit. But I feel like this is the only responsible and logical thing to do. End it now while I'm still me, before this takes over. From now on I plan to stop taking my meds, as the mood swings will help me get this done. Then end by exit bag or hanging while listening to Avril 14th.

We have two kids, one is high functioning autistic. She basically has said she isn’t sure if we are going to stay together. I’m also “not fun to be around” anymore. I’m not perfect, I have a bit of a temper sometimes, but I love my wife and kids. I already know what’s going to happen. She’s going to leave me, and take the kids, the house and our friends. I tried hanging myself last Thursday, but was too much of a pussy to do it, I broke down crying while the noose was tightening. We are going on a family cruise next week and I figure it’ll be a great last memory. I’m going to wait until the second to last day, then jump over board in the middle of the night. No body, no messy cleanup. I just disappear from their lives. I’ll solve the problem. Besides, I’m worth WAY more dead than alive. I’ve had a $750k life insurance policy for 13 years and I’m past the suicide clause period. My kids will be financially set. I’m not worried for them, their mother is an amazing mom, they won’t need me. \n\nEDIT: Thank you all for your wonderful comments and messages. I’m going to hold on and try to take one day at a time. Ignoring that depression-voice is hard. The one that whispers in my ear that “she doesn’t love you and your kids would be better off without you”, it is hard to ignore sometimes. ",

No. You will wake up routinely every hour or so.

I slept super late, I forgot I was scheduled to work, couldn't get dressed, couldn't leave the house, tried to fix my bike but ended up breaking it even more. Then I gave into pretty much all of my self-sabotaging vices (drugs, porn, shitty food, video games, you name it). \n\n  \nI swear something snapped. I cried a *ridiculous* amount throughout the day and spent the rest of the night feverishly reading up on suicide. I actually figured out my gameplan. I found a whole document outlining the specifics and answered all the little questions I had (sorry not sharing — don't even ask me) plus a backup option in case I'm desperate enough to do something quicker. For now, I'm in the stage of acquiring the materials and getting my affairs in order.\n\n  \nSince I got my suicide method figured out, I'm in a strangely upbeat mood. \n\nIt's an odd paradox. Finalizing my plan of action to end my life made me feel motivated to go out and live it. I'm getting chores done with no sweat, I'm dancing and listening to fun music, I'm gaining bits of my personality back. A great weight has been lifted off my shoulders.\n\nFrom what I heard, it's common for people to act calm or joyful the days before they make an attempt. Is that what I'm experiencing? Maybe it's because I have a goal now? Like my days don't feel meaningless like they persistently have? Or maybe finally there's an escape route to break free from the shitshow that is my life. I don't feel as trapped and hopeless anymore. \n\nAnyways, I wanted to see if this anyone here had a similar experience or wants to weigh in on this situation.\n\nTL:DR - I'm actively suicidal for the first time in my life and I feel much better after I figured out my method.

I remember parts of the past and only feel pain. \n\nI am fundamentally broken on many levels and I do not believe repair is possible. The only permanent fix is a bullet to the brain. \n\nGoodnight.\n\nEdit: I am very grateful for the kind words many of you have shared. I am so sorry that many of you feel the same as I; it’s truly unfair that modern life is built this way. I am getting ready for my shift at work, and while I know it’s going to fucking suck, at least it pays. Not enough of course, but it’s something. \n\nHope everyone reading this has an alright day. Drink some coffee or tea if that’s something you like. It makes things marginally better.",

    "selftext": "Woke up at noon. Stared at the ceiling, slept again, woke up again and stared at the ceiling for a while once more. Took a thick cloth belt from the closet, tied one end around the bookshelf, put the loop around my neck. \n\nFirst thing I noticed was the pressure. My face felt like it was pulsing and expanding, like I could feel myself turning red. Then a loud ringing in my ears drowning out everything else. Then choking and sputtering as I breathed in and couldn’t. Arms and legs spasmed, took a conscious effort to not reach for the belt. Twice I tried to die, but both times I couldn't help but struggle to ease the belt off my neck. Strangling myself made my being alive feel so much more immediate, which was nauseating compared to the dissociative sad stasis preceding my decision to die. Which is ironic because I had previously believed I'd want to be conscious when I die, but it would be so much easier to just slip away silently in my sleep or something. I now have petechial hemorrhage all over my face, and some on my neck. My throat perpetually feels like it has a lump in it. I have a persistent bad headache, nausea, I feel like I can't think more than one looping thought per minute, I can barely focus on any coherent train of thought nor input from the physical world. It has taken me hours to write this. Honestly, not a good time. \n\nThis is not the first time I've tried to kill myself and frankly, I am seriously worried it won't be the last. Somehow I feel both like I want to end my life and also like I don't, and in those fleeting moments of unsuicidal lucidity (madness?) I try to find ways to save or at least prevent myself from what I might do. I've heard that stuff about people who survived jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge saying right after they jumped they realized all their problems were solvable and they shouldn't have jumped, but for me that wasn't really the case. After the second try didn't succeed I kinda just sat there for a while feeling nothing. It was oddly soothing, feeling totally blank when usually my mind and emotions spiral incessantly in a depressive pattern. I wasn't relieved to be alive, I felt no new resolve to live my life to the fullest or even at all, and most of all, the things that made me want to die are just as present and real as they were before I strung the belt around my neck. In fact, the biggest thing that made me decide to die feels itself immortal and unkillable:\n\nEvil. The world is evil, pervasively and ubiquitously so. I have been on the receiving end of it in more ways and more times than I care to remember, and I know I've contributed to it through my own thoughts and actions. Yes there is beauty and love and joy in the world, and such things are real and important, but in my experience they are fickle and pale in comparison to the omnipotent, omnipresent capacity of human evil. They don't make life worthwhile to me, and it follows that I don't feel as though life is inherently worthwhile either. To find happiness is fortunate and fleeting, because evil is the backdrop, the default. You are guaranteed to find evil, and you never need to look far.\n\nSince I was a child, I would cry for hours on end, heartbroken at the suffering and horror caused by the evil humans do to each other. Why do people suffer, and make others suffer? How can such a world, and a life in such a world be worthwhile? I am 25 now and in that regard, I haven't changed much at all. If anything, it's more unbearable now. I have searched my entire life for something to make it make sense. I've read novels and poetry, I've read and listened to various religious and spiritual teachings, I spent years studying philosophy, I've listened to and made music, I've seen and made art, I've talked to people who seem able to cope, desperately trying to find something to redeem this shithole of a world. And I'm still as empty handed as I was years ago, but it feels worse now because I'm surrounded by failed explanations and justifications and it feels like I've run out of new ones to consider. Being surrounded by the husks of failed answers to that eternal, painful question feels somehow more desolate than being in a void of none.\n\nFrankly, I don't want to live in a world plagued by the sadistic, broken darkness of the human soul. It feels maudlin and perhaps naive to say that the bottomless evil of humanity is what made me decide to take my life, but it's the honest reason. And it's not going anywhere anytime soon. The final words of Nicolas Chamfort in his suicide note have always resonated with me: \"And so I leave this world, where the heart must either break or turn to lead.\" \n\nRight now, I don't want to try and kill myself again. But I don't know what to do to make sure that doesn't happen. I don't know that I won't attempt it again tomorrow. It's highly unlikely that I'm going to have a transformative experience that reveals god and purpose that solves it all in the next few hours a la Cat Stevens or something. I feel that perhaps this is the kind of situation where one should check themselves into the hospital, but the thought of being isolated and constantly monitored for several days is straight up terrifying and sickening, on top of the worry of medical costs and not wanting to strain medical services further as they struggle in the current pandemic. I need an answer. I need something, anything that makes it less horrible. What makes life worth living, in spite of all the evil? How? How does anyone face this and manage to live, to find meaning in life, to wake up and feel like it's worth it? Why shouldn't I try to kill myself again, when evil springs eternal, when I contribute to it myself? Why should I try to go on living in an evil, broken, disappointing world?",

    "selftext": "Hello :) \nI am 24F, from a small country in Europe. I am writing this as I have no one to actually say goodbye to - maybe, just maybe someone will notice this so i can get a farewell. And if anyone is interested, I will talk a bit about myself, because all I wanted was for someone to care..\n\nI want no one to be sad for me, I am going content knowing I actually gave life a shot and tried my best! But I know this is the best solution :( Life is not meant for everyone and that is okay. \n\nEver since I was little I had no other purpose than to be mercilessly abused by my teachers and peers and neglected by my parents (I believe they did not mean to, so I have no hard feelings though). \nI was treated as if I was less than human. If something in the class broke, they all agreed to blame it on me. If someone didn’t wipe the board that day, they’d say I was on duty so I’d be the one punished. They’d also beat me with a chair, push me down the stairs, throw my pencils out the window, step on my clothes so they’d be dirty, throw food in my face… you get the idea. At some point kids said if you touched me, you’d get a virus that made you as stupid and ugly as I was so no one wanted to sit next to me. I get really sad when I see younger pictures of myself :( She was a sweet girl and she didnt deserve that. Every day was like walking on the battlefield, I would pray to God to take me away but he didn’t want to. I was 11 at most :( My only relief was art, anime, video games and such. Up until 15 I only had online friends on an internet forum back then, and they helped me with loneliness. \n\nHigh school was a bit better but I ended up really depressed and spent it battling an eating disorder and not living my years unlike my peers :( My parents didnt notice I was struggling even though I was losing so much weight, they were too attentive to my little brother that had some issues so he needed more help and attention which I understood. But I was left to battle everything alone with no support :( I developed depression, SH issues and an ED. I went to therapy but didn’t help much :( \n\nRight now i’m working with kids, they are cute and I love them but my workplace is really abusive and it brought me to a new low :( it’s well paid but that doesn’t help me much. I dread everyday just like I did when I was a kid. I am just living the same sh’t again and again and cannot change anything. I know if I keep on living it will just be more and more abuse as this is why i was born :( i don’t know anything else but this. \n\nLove of my life left me a while ago and he is much better without me. Im too broken to love and be loved. (D, if u ever read this know that I loved u from the bottom of my heart. I am sorry I was not a better gf for you.)\n\nSadly I cannot feel anything anymore but despair and hopelessness. I left behind all my dreams of being an artist or a sports teacher or a trainer (i really love working out) sadly I chose psychology to study and I cannot change it anymore nor study something else :( I don’t even have the energy left anymore anyway. \n\nI really hope my parents will take care of my cats, two strays I saved and raised from since they were the size of my palm. Maxine and Sissi, you kept me alive for a little more and you are the light of my life 🤍 I will remember your shiny, emerald eyes, your soft fur, and you purring on my chest as I pass away. \n\nI had so much love to give sadly I didn’t know how to give and receive , and I am also really scared of people deep down :( I dont know how to fit in and never knew. I tried to change my life inside and outside, I really tried it all. But now my soul is really worn out :( \nI would like to thank everyone who kept me alive for a little longer, anyone who ever tried even in the slightest to encourage me, and saw even the littlest potential in me. \nI am sorry I bit like a scared dog the hands of people who tried to help because I couldn’t distinguish anymore who was and who wasn’t well-meaning. I am so sorry :( I have many regrets in this life too, all them being I wasn’t a better person to the very little people who loved me. In my last moments, I hope they can forgive me and visit my grave or think about me from time to time. I am sending everyone so much love and gratitude, it was a difficult journey and a really painful one too. I think my soul has learned a lot in this painful lifetime. But it is enough. \n\nMom, Dad, I love you. I forgive you for not being there for me. I hope you can forgive me too. My dear cats, I love you. My beloved ex bf, I forgive you for leaving and i’ll always love you. The friends I had and left, i’ll cherish the memories. And everyone who took their time to read until the end, thank you! Goodbye everyone! \n\n",

I’m not even actively suicidal right now, but I consider it often enough for me to realize that I’m one of the outliers in society. So, over the years suicide has become more and more realistic, and has almost become a part of my daily life.\n\nWhat gets me though is how that’s *totally* not the case for everyone else. If you mention suicide, people either freak out or just play it off as a joke as if the concept of “suicide” only exists in movies and books. And while it is sad, I actually find that kind of funny.\n\nFor example, I hate working. I fucking hate getting up early to sit at a desk doing shit I don’t want to do for 8 hours straight. But if I tell anyone about that feeling, guess how the conversation will go?\n\nMe: man, I really don’t want a job. I wish I could just sit around doing nothing all day.\n\nThem: well you need money, don’t you?\n\nMe: yeah but I don’t want to get a job.\n\nThem: tough, that’s the way the world works, you lazy fuck. You’ve gotta work if you wanna live.\n\nMe: well technically I don’t *have* to, because i could just kill myself and not have to deal with it.\n\nThem: seriously? You’d rather commit suicide than get a job? That’s pathetic.\n\nMe: yep, I’m pathetic. Thanks for reminding me, that’s another reason why I should just kill myself.\n\nThem: wait, you’re serious? Nooooo don’t kill yourself you’re loved and you have so much to live for!!!!\n\nI just find it funny that people don’t consider how all of this bullshit could just stop immediately If I put a gun in my mouth. They’re like “if you don’t want to live by the world’s rules, you don’t get to live at all >:(“\n\nBut when I decide “yeah that sounds fair enough, guess I’ll just off myself then :)” their tune changes and they can’t fathom that anyone would choose to not live in this vicious cycle of suffering and guilt.\n\nOf course I can’t say any of this shit in real life, because I don’t think this attitude helps in the slightest. It’s nice to think and rant about online, but if I started telling people how I really feel I’d get thrown back into the psych ward. Or worse, people I care about would get tired of my moping around and they’d cut me off, and then I’d *have* to go through with it.\n\nEverything’s fucked, and the only *”real”* solution I can come up with is just opting out of life. And if I bring it up before actually going through with it, I can only expect to be mocked or bombarded with insincere attempts at “helping”.\n\nIsn’t life fantastic? :D",

There is no reward for not killing yourself every day. no thank you for spiraling by myself, cutting by myself, getting drunk by myself so no one sees. \n\nI am successful, pretty, young, happy, and loved. And the pain continues. I don’t think anyone will believe how crushing it is.\n\n--EDIT:\n\nGuys, I am so moved by your comments. I posted and expected silence, but your support feels like a wave pushing me forward.\n\nSomething beautiful someone shared: \"Those who suffer are never alone because those who have suffered have their back unconditionally.\" I see you all.

    "selftext": "2016\nIt’s close to midnight. It’s dark and cold. My door is closed. As I lay about to fall asleep I hear something. I’m half awake half asleep so I don’t really acknowledge it. I turn on my right side and try to fall asleep again. But then I hear something. I open my eyes too scared to turn back over to see what it is. It sounded like someone was crawling beside my bed. Here I lay, trying to figure out what it is. Then I hear a very loud “hey!” Yelled right in my ear. I instantly sit up and look around my room but of course I see nothing. I must just be paranoid. \n~••••••~\n2005\nIt was a few months after my mom married him. I never really liked him. When he did what he did, I was too young to understand what it meant. He’d put me on his lap, grab my sides and butt when my mother was working. He called me his “favorite”. It was just touching then. How I wish it never had to be more. \n~••••••~\n2007\nWe had just got back from a family party the first time it happened. It was really late at night and my mother went to sleep as soon as we got home I remember being half awake as she told him to carry me to bed as I was already sleeping from the car ride home. Their room was upstairs mine was in the basement. As he put me to bed he started touching me. By then I was awake. He was on top of me and told me to be quiet as he held his hand over my mouth. I remember crying and looking out my bedroom window counting in my head thinking of when it was going to be over. I was in so much pain. When he was done, he told me again how I was his favorite. I couldn’t do anything but cry. The next morning my mom was already gone at work and there I was, stuck in a house with a monster. \n~••••••~\n2013\nIt was going on for a few years now. Yes, I did want and try to tell my mom about it, but I was so scared she wouldn’t love me anymore and would blame me for it happening so I never did, because he said if I told, she wouldn’t want me anymore. In school my grades dropped, my attendance dropped, and I’d never pay attention. I felt so alone and so scared. Yes, I did self harm as I felt that the pain of that would not hurt as much as the pain from him. I did run away, and when my councilor found out, I talked to her, I told her an excuse saying I didn’t wanna go home because I hated when he yelled, I couldn’t tell her the real reason was because of what he did to me almost every night. I couldn’t tell her as much as I wanted to. I felt so isolated. She called him and he had picked me up from school, when we got home he immediately did what he did to me almost every night and said I deserved it for being bad. My mom was always out working as she worked two jobs and would really only be home 7am-12pm. \n~•••••~\n2015 \nA few years later and it was still happening. I was sick every morning and when I told my friends about it they joked around saying I was pregnant. I laughed along but in my head I thought, “could I really be?”. I remember stealing a pregnancy test from a pharmacy and took it as soon as I got home. It was positive. I felt sick, then and there I wanted to throw up, no not from being pregnant but from being pregnant from him, my step father. I just wanted to die. I remember a few days going by as my mom cleaned my room she found the test. She yelled at me for not being careful and was yelling at me for becoming pregnant at such a young age. Little did she know, the father was the man she married, the man that has been sexually abusing me for years, my step father. I miscarried at 10 weeks, as bad as it may sound, I was glad I did. \n~••••••~\n2016\nMy mom had finally divorced the piece of shit after she found out he was cheating and I had so much relief after that. I thought finally no more pain. Later that year, I was constantly getting in trouble, doing drugs, trying to be cool hanging with the “bad kids”. I was expelled mid freshman year. I started going to an alternative school for kids who got expelled from high schools. There I met a friend I’ve known since kindergarten. We started hanging out everyday after school. I thought to myself that wow someone is actually being nice to me. There was this Friday where I was hanging out with a different friend when I ran into him and his friends. We decided to all hang out and we went in an ally way to drink and he had given me some pills saying it would get me “high”. Being the uncaring trying to fit in cool kid I took them and drank. My friend I was with had left with some dude that he was hanging with. So it was just me him and his other friend. We decided to go chill in a stairwell. I was so gone off whatever I had taken and from all the drinking I did. I remember him asking to have sex and I said no. I passed out and next thing I knew he was on top of me as his friend watched. I quickly pushed him off put my pants back on and as I ran down the stairway crying I seen him and his friend high five. I called my sister for a ride home but didn’t tell her what happen. When I got home I started crying to my mom but all she did was yell at me for coming home late and didn’t even ask me why I was crying. I went in my room wondering how could he do that to me? Someone I knew since elementary school. How could this happen. As I laid in bed, I thought to myself that I was nothing. I was already being sexually abused from my step dad for years and now it happens again at age 16 from someone I called a friend. By then, all I wanted to do was die. I thought after that monster was out of my life I’d be a little okay, yet it happened again from someone I knew and considered a friend. \n~••••••~\n2018\nI am 18 and I try to drink every weekend I can with older friends. Because I didn’t want to be sober on weekends when I was by myself I didn’t want to be alone with my thoughts. Because on weekdays I’d be occupied by work. So weekends I’d just drink every chance I could. It was not good. Everywhere I went to drink, there was always one dude touching me and pushing his self on me. I thought to myself wow I really can’t get away from this stuff. All my life I’ve endured so much pain from people I thought were supposed to protect me. Sure I drank and maybe you think it’s my fault for putting myself in such a situation like this. I couldn’t get away from it. I thought to myself the best way out of this hell of a loop is taking myself out. I’ve attempted suicide 3 times the past year. Soon it will be my time to go, because all I feel is pain and loneliness. I’m so scarred and paranoid from the things my step father did that every night I have to sleep with ear plugs in and a blanket over my face because I’m scared that he will be standing next to me even though I know he’s gone. \n\n\nNot the place to post, but at the time, I just needed it out of my mind. And yes, cops were eventually involved for everyone asking. ",

    "title": "Hey yo, FUCK YOU to whoever tied up their dog inside my chicken coop",
    "selftext": "I’m so fucking done. I woke up this morning to my dog barking so I looked outside. I didn’t see anything . It was like 8 am and I was still tired so I just went back to bed. Fast forward to about an hour later, my dog hasn’t stopped barking so I’m a bit nervous. It’s about time for his walk so I put him on a leash and head to the back door. Low and behold, THERE IS A FUCKING DOG IN THE CHICKEN COOP. \n\nIf you look at my post history, you know that I fucking loved these chickens, I raised them with the help of my sister and they were our babies. We originally said we were gonna eat them when we got them but the more we hung out with them, the more we realized how smart and kind chickens are. As stupid as it was, they were part of the family. We named them, celebrated their first eggs. Cuddled them, spoiled them. Like I said, they were family. \n\nNow imagine the absolute horror I felt when I saw some big ass dog eating my babies while they bleed out screaming, knowing I could’ve saved them if I wasn’t a lazy piece of shit. I ran out there as fast as I could screaming in terror. At first I thought it was just a case of a stray dog because there was a hole in the side of the cage but then I started investigating. \n\nThe dog had a knot around his leash connected to one of the perches that were stapled to the ground. \n\nThe lock on the bottom of the door was open but the top was closed. My sister and I always close the top and the bottom. \n\nAfter we got the dog out, we found five alive chickens and put them in a dog cage but he had no interest in them.\n\nThe hole in the side of the coop was jetting outward, meaning something tried to escape\n\nI think that what happened was that someone waited for my mom to leave to go to the park 7:40 am, grabbed the dog, put it inside the cage, unhooked it to tie the leash to the perch, the dog tried to get out which in turn led to him biting the hole in the chicken wire, and halfway through the dog’s escape the intruder pulled it back in, causing the bloody pieces of dog fur on the rim of the hole, the the intruder made his escape through the door but since the door was jammed he only locked the top lock.\n[My poor babies](https://imgur.com/gallery/sWMUy0l)\n\nIt’s probably the same person who broke into our cars about two days ago. I don’t understand why I’m being targeted. I called the police but they of course didn’t listen and just took the dog to paws. Someone needs to be in jail for this. I know that if this happened any other year the police would’ve put more effort but they’re probably just trying to make a statement that blue lives matter just cause I’m black. \n\nAlso my parents and I have been arguing like crazy. I came out as trans (ftm) to them maybe like 2 months ago and it’s been downhill from there. My mom was supportive at first and then I told my dad and she suddenly switched to his side?? Now she keeps being passive aggressive about it by constantly saying stuff like “Some girls have guy features but you don’t. You need to embrace how PRETTY you are. YOURE such a PRETTY GIRL.” My dad finally let me cut my hair but he constantly bashes on trans people saying stuff like “Trans people don’t deserve rights because they’re mentally ill” despite me being not only trans but also schizophrenic. And he also threatens to take away my internet every time I respect anyone’s pronouns. They’ve also been arguing between each other a lot more. Nothing physical but they get really loud and it freaks me out because I have really bad noise sensitivity.\n\nI want to get out of here so bad. Not like my home but this entire existence. I could rant on and on about how much I would enjoy an eternal slumber but I’ve already been typing for like 2.5 hours so I should stop here\n\nTL;DR Someone killed my pet chickens, broke into my car and my parents hate trans people despite me being openly out to them",

    "selftext": "At the suggestion of my therapist, he recommended I join reddit.  So, I'm giving this a try.  I'm 40 years old and suicidal.  I live in New Hampshire, USA.  I have been thinking lately, that, it is my time to leave this world.  I am also addicted to porn and have been viewing it for years.  I've never had a girlfriend, nor have I ever had sex with a woman.  I have only seen one escort in Boston, Massachusetts.  I was excited (too excited) about the prospect of having sex that while the escort and I were lying in bed nude (she was caressing my chest up and down) and she put her hand over my d\\*ck, my rocket launched unexpectedly - yes, premature ejaculation.  Sometimes it happens.  Needless to say, we didn't have sex.\n\nI am so depressed and lonely.  I have come to the realization that I'm unattractive to women and that there is no point in living anymore.  I hate my job.  I work in a call center for a major Boston-based insurance company.  It's a terrible job.  I get yelled at by people and I'm completely exhausted every day after talking on the phone with customers.  My job has nothing to do with my college degree.  I majored in marine transportation while attending a maritime academy.  I worked as a junior ship's officer aboard oil tankers for 2 years, but eventually I was fired.  The captain who fired me thought that I was incompetent.\n\nMy porn use has escalated.  I look at it almost every morning before I have to sign-on to my work computer to take calls from customers.  I'm working from home right now because of COVID-19.  Also, I don't look at porn on my work computer - I'm not that stupid.  I only look at porn on my personal computer.\n\nIn 2017, I asked out a woman at work who was older than me.  She was in her early 40s.  A beautiful blonde who had a very sexy face and a beautiful body.  Anyway, I got rejected and sometimes I think she rejected me because she thought I was ugly.\n\nI'm currently seeing a psychologist and a psychiatrist and the therapy just doesn't seem to work for me.  I feel so hopeless like nothing will ever get better.  I don't think that I will ever find a woman because I am unattractive and skinny.  I was going to the gym to lift weights, but then I stopped.\n\nI did attempt suicide about a year ago.  After my attempt, my family suggested that I go to the hospital.  So, I went to Portsmouth Regional Hospital in New Hampshire into their Behaivoral Health Unit.  I spent 7 days there.  After I got out of the hospital, I felt better but then later on I started looking at porn again and felt depressed and lonely.\n\nI've tried dating sites like [Match.com](https://Match.com) and [OKCupid.com](https://OKCupid.com) and haven't had any success.  I had a subscription for about 1 1/2 years and decided to unsubscribe recently because I just wasn't getting any responses from women.\n\nThe only thing that keeps me going are my two nieces who are 8 and 4 years old whom I enjoy playing with like hide-and-go-seek, ride bikes, play catch, play Monopoly and swimming in a pool.  I just love them so much.\n\nAny advice?  I plan on seeing another escort because my goal is to have sex with a woman.  I just don't I have much of a life left in this world.  My uncle committed suicide at 45 years old and I've been strongly considering the same thing.  Maybe sooner if not later when I reach 45.\n\nThank You for reading my post.",

Years have passed & after starting to see a psychiatrist, I was diagnosed with severe PTSD & a severe anxiety disorder. I tend to drink to cope with my problems.

    "selftext": "Today, as 25th may I've decided to kill myself. Not sure if it's because I've finally gathered enough confidence, or if it's because I finally understand things I didn't before. I do not seek help, however, attention would be nice, to be heard at least one time in my life; to finally show the world my most secret flaws, my archivements, the things I've accomplished, the bad memories, overall: to finally tell my despicable legacy. \n\nI feel invisible. \n\nI've been invisible my whole life. While never completely ignored, always felt invisible. \nI feel alone, even when I'm with the ones that are close to me; it is something I've been trying to stop for around 10 years, but finally give up.\n\nAt first, I was born as an accident, I've never been told that, nor made feel that way, but is clear that a mother who is 19, and a father who is 21, didn't exactly planned a child outside even a stable relation. \nI was lucky to be born in a somewhat rich family. I lived with my mother, her parents and my uncle until I was 5, then moved to a flat, with my mother and her new husband. \nFrom 0 to 4 life was decently good, I don't personally recall any bad experiences, but I was told recently from my grandmother that I would usually cry and reject being taken from my home to hers. I don't know why. \nMy dad was poor by that time, he was still studying as a ecologist. He was present, to be fair, he was more present when I couldn't remember. \n\nFrom 5 to 12 I lived in the flat I mentioned early. I was there alone most of the day. Now I think, what kind of parent would leave a kid alone in a flat at the age of 5? Well, one that clearly didn't care enough. At 6 I joined school, the same monotous hell I assisted for 12 years. I never really fitted with the average person. I wasn't an outcast, or a creep, I had friends. They weren't good friends, but they were friends after all. We would normally go to each other houses and play together, watch movies, etc. \nI never did good in school, I barely did decent. Parents reacted in the only logical way they could think of, by beating me. Luckily my mother and dad broke up when I was around 3, so each of them went their way. \nMy father never, ever hit me. He was a rational man who believed in dicipline through love, tho he never showed me love. \nNothing particulary especial happened from the age of 6 to 12, besides being bullied by some classmates; leading me to bully the ones who were weaker than me, which I completely regret. \n\nAt the age of 10 this odd feeling started in my chest, some kind of void? Some kind of sucking force that was draining my energy, my happiness and somehow, my willing to live. I didn't understand it. I had no idea why it was happening. Suddenly, the world was no more love painted. A great hatred towards this new enviorement grew in me. To see everyone as an enemy. Years later I understood that was when my depression began, my daily prison, the loneliness I feel every day; that was the starting point. \nAt 12, I cannot recall what was in especific that made me cut, but something made me look for some kind of redemption in flagellation. I enjoyed it to some degree. I never did it to a serious level, and I stopped fairly quick, it only lasted for around 6 months. Months of carving my hatred and depression in my horrible body. \nI forgot to mention that I've been called, or been made feel ugly my whole life, untill today. So a natural doubt about myself, and my body arise, and it's been here with me since so long... \n\nAt this point I'm a bit drunk. Getting everything ready for my departure, as I listen to There's no beauty left here, amazing album. \n\nSadly I never got hug any significant another, let alone kiss. I never felt the love of someone else, never got to cuddle anyone, to trust, to love, to have sex with, to share my thoughts. I've always been by my own, I've always been alone. What saddens me the most, is that I've never been heard. I've always been ignored.\n\nInvisible. That's what I've been feeling like for about 4 years. \n\nEveryone around me gets talked by others. Others interact with others, but not me. \nIt covers many aspects, not only been talked but... I don't know how to explain it. I am a somewhat smart person, but sometimes I believe I'm really invisible? \nSometimes I talk to people in real life, and they just ignore me? \nPhilosophy has been an interesting topic for me, yet I cannot answer myself. If I'm ignored like that, am I even there? Was I part of a community? \n\nBut this is about the good things I did, too. \nI joined the fire brigade. Had a good time there, it filled myself more than any other activity, I helped men, women and children. Tho it was never enough to bury the loneliness and emptiness I felt. \n\nI also rescued a kitty that was pregnant! I called her Mamou, she had 4 little kitties which I gifted to people I knew who would take good care of them. \n\nBut it's been 2 years since I've been living on my own, Mamou died 3 weeks ago, which made me realize the futily of life. But overall, made something a bit more clear for me. It wasn't hatred what I felt for the world, but disappointment. We've come so far as a species. We have so much potential, but it's been wasted, and me myself I am guilty of this. I haven't done anything remarkable. \nI am disappointed at the selfishness, the antipathy, the greed, and the distancing of humans. \n\nFor those reasons I am sorry for whoever will have to clean my body, or cremate it? I am sure my parents won't want a funeral for me. I mean, even less with whats going on with the world right now \n\nThat leads me to my next point, betrayal, backstabbing and abandon. That's what some of my friends did to me. They ditched me out of their lives like a spent torch, like a used tissue. \nSure, I did a mistake, I admit it. I did many mistakes. But looking at them in a objective way, is not much different of what our true nature is, in other words, I never did something worth abandoning your friend, and then getting them fired of their job.\n\nQuarantine is fucked up, makes me realize that the little chances I had of meeting someone before, now are completely gone. Tho it hasn't been all bad, I got fit. I lost a lot of weight. I've read hundred of classic and cult books, same for music. \n\nAnyway, to the last point. The things I most regret in life? Probably not being more myself, that would have probably brought more pain, but it is uncertain. \nI regret never meeting and loving someone, it was harsh seeing everyone around me find someone, everyone but me. \n\nIf you made it this far, I cannot properly explain how much I appreciate the time you dedicated reading this. This is more attention than all the one I've been given through my whole life. It felt really good to open up after so long\n\nI am Tomás Renard, these are the last words I want to say before leaving this world, and venturing into the next one. If anyone is concerned, know I will leave happy that at least read this post. I will leave with the only thing that has been here for me my whole life, a nice bottle of pipeño wine",

I feel so profoundly alone, I know I can talk to my loved ones, but I’ve seen how it breaks their hearts when I tell them how hopeless I feel. So I kept everything to myself and put on fake smiles and happy conversations and (I’m a recovering alcoholic) didn’t tell anyone about my relapses etc. I just wanted to be a normal person.\n\nLast night I reached my wits end. I really tried to be better. I tried to keep everyone happy. But I can’t ignore this deep ache I feel in my heart and soul. An ache that feels like my very existence to the core is not natural, not meant to be there \n\nSo I set up a noose on my curtain rail, wrote a short letter to say goodbye and sorry and got on a chair. My mom walked into my room as I was standing by the curtain and I managed to hide the noose and make an excuse about trying to fix my curtain, she said I should stop being silly and go get dinner, I told her I’d come just now but she wouldn’t let up. So.. I just slipped the rope on and jumped off the chair as fast I could. I thought it would kill me fast enough but instead I had my mom trying to hold my body up while I suffocated and my dad trying to cut the rope down with a knife. \n\nIt’s the next day and I feel a thousand times worse that I put everyone through hell AND couldn’t even get the job done. I’m a horrible human being, because despite all of that, I still want nothing more than to stop existing. \nI truly don’t believe that I’ll ever be able to live a life that isn’t agonising for me 90% of the time. How does one ever come to terms with such a thing.\n\nEdit: thank you so much to all the kind souls who offered me words of comfort, encouragement and helpful advice. I’m so incredibly grateful for the support and not feeling so alone through all of this. \n\nI am currently in a mental facility, voluntarily, to get the professional help I desperately need and being here has been helping me immensely. I won’t try to give anyone advice on how to deal with their thoughts and feelings, but I’m extremely grateful to have been given a chance to get help. I just had to be willing to ask for it.

As in, I wanna kill myself most days, but I only ever brought it up when I wanted attention and affection and people didn't want to give it. I've ruined plenty a relationship and friendship that way, no sense in doing it again. It makes them so sad, and hurt, and afraid when I tell them, and usually they can't do anything anyway. Plus, I don't think I'll really do it anyway... so might as well just reach out to random internet strangers.",

I’m going to tell you my story in a new attempt to gain enough relief to fall asleep tonight. Thanks for reading if you do <3",
    "selftext": "\nGrowing up, I was always a really weird kid. I distinctly remember that I had just seen the world differently. It seemed that my imagination had a bigger play in my life than most. Me and a friend in kind garden would squeeze batteries in our hands and pretend that we were Mario or Pokémon because neither of our families could/would buy us a game console but we were exposed to them by relatives and tv. It was so simple back then and looking back so pure,  but it felt like we were there. We didn’t have what other kids had to have fun so we became those things. As far as I know I was a decent enough kid however when my brother came along around age 4, we would fight, I would hurt him, not bad (typically young brother bs) but still enough to get beaten from my father when he got off work. My father more so was (he is still with us) a rigid, traditionally Hispanic in parenting, angry, regretful person. When he was in the house there was always a strange energy of danger even if nothing was going on. It was better to just stay quiet. This didn’t really work because my younger brother soon learned that it was an easy win when we’d bicker to just cry out loud, our dad would come in, beat my ass and I would curse my brothers name for doing so but alas it would get me to stop. My real last memory of child abuse before my teens is about 15 seconds of my dad putting me in a corner on the ground, telling me if I wanted to fight to put my hands up and when I did to just shield myself he pummeled me with closed fists. I was around 10 years old, maybe give or take a couple years, not sure, I have terrible memory of most my life. As I got older, my brother and I actually started bonding, he liked the way I started standing up to our dad no matter how bad I was beat down. He’s told me i inspired him. My mom btw is/was awesome, but didn’t really do much except yell to stop from the sidelines or leave the room since she couldn’t bear to watch. I can’t blame her, not much negativity felt towards her for I know she unconditionally loves me and that must’ve been a tough and traumatic experience for her as well. Moving forward, I’m a decent student, normally averaging around low A’s my brothers straight A’s if not 100’s, not much of a big deal there, my mom started adding incentives once we grew into our early teens (for every A we got in a semester she’d give us like 10 dollars or something, it was dope so we did well). Through out life I feel like I found connections that I would replace for my fathers love, through friendship. I grew very close and desperately wanted to fit in with my friends. I would spend hours out of the house riding bikes around the neighborhood doing dumb lil kid shit, but it was a really freeing time out I remember. Fast forward, around when I was 14, my brother 11 my mom bought me a bass guitar because I had been getting into random enough Japanese rock from the anime I would watch and to me the bassist was always the most bad ass and going crazy member, my brother came along and she bought him a guitar spur of the moment, figured it would help us bond. It did. It really did and I thank everything in this world for those times that followed because they were hands down the best years of my life. I was a shitty bassist and soon transitioned over to wanting to be a singer and my brother excelled at guitar, going onto be called a prodigy by everyone from teachers, producers and most of the respected music industry people we would eventually encounter. But at the time he was my little brother and being a fresh teen thought it would be wack to have my 11 year old brother in the band. I started a couple bands, the second one introducing my brother in as lead guitar. This was a turning point.\n\nBack to family life, my dad started to realize he was aging and I was starting to gain my testosterone fueled teenage body, this didn’t stop anything, but only extended our fights into actual fights. My dad, a correction officer, doing manual labor his whole life handed my ass to me every time. All while telling me to kill myself and how no one loved me and I was a mistake. Nothing like this was said to my brother, unless in terms of how I’ve manipulated him into becoming just like me. I became a bit of a shitty protector of the house hold, two accounts stick out immeasurably to me. The first being (funny kind of a call back to how my brother would yell for my dad to come) my brother was upstairs and screamed Tyler help dad just hit me. In a blind fury, i bum rushed my dad onto the floor, commanded my brother to hold his arms down and pummeled him in his face, chest, balls, anywhere i could hit before he brother free all while yelling the likes of “it used to just be me, that’s where you should’ve left it”. It was a powerful moment. My father spent the rest of the week walking downstairs like a caged tiger screaming and laughing about how he was going to kill me. ‘‘Twas still a sweet victory. No fear.\n\nI’ll speed up the rest: me and my bro made a band, everyone betrayed us, we made another and took full control of who was in it, wrote all the music, what we looked like, who we recorded with, and what not. With his help i created a two year plan to get signed to a label called Fearless Records. We played metal. It was therapeutic and empowering stuff to play after everything you’ve read thus far. \n\nWe did it in four months.\n\nI got a text by our newly acquired manager that we had been offered a deal by the label of our dreams. I cried and got sent home early. A record that I wrote all the lyrics to and my brother wrote all the music to, all fueled by the hate and distinction of our father son dissonance. It was the biggest victory a small town probably has seen, at least our small town. Every time he said we were garbage, we should try something else, i couldn’t sing and my brother should play something nice. Every time he laid a hand on us, put into songs and we did it in four months! Still makes me proud to this day man. \n\nBtw, this isn’t a story about my father.\nHe is not the reason I want to kill myself anymore.\n\nThe label fucked us over, made us record 3 different records each time hating something that they previously wanted and we called it quits. Our deal was good n no need to recoup anything, just disband.\n\nThis is where whatever is inside me to this day was brought into this life. A foe I don’t know if I can beat this time. Throughout the story so far, I had a flame inside of me. The whole time a purpose to prove. A will to fight. I always told people that I wasn’t sad, I was angry. And the anger forged who I was. A determined, skill ful musician, with the mane of a lion and the attitude to match, a man who did it. But when that all went away. I became a worm, but not yet.\n\nShit with my dad cooled off, he retired. I’m assuming his job really was the culprit of the aggression and I stopped holding the past against him. At this point I had been a dumbass at points too and figured it was not worth the energy or the negativity of keeping that cloud around. Was he still an incredibly ill informed, ego centric prick? Yeah, but I was a different person now and couldn’t be bothered with it. Most times shrugging off his comments. I had worth now.\n\nMe and my bro made another band with just our drummer from the previously signed act, but it didn’t last long, we did an all over the place EP that was uninspiring yet everyone we showed loved it. Drummer left, became a solo artist, he’s a whole other story. I can’t help but feel as tho I’m responsible for his and my brothers mental state as I’m 3-4 years older than both of them (i was always the dad figure to them).\n\nFuck it tho, rock n roll, we did it once we’ll do it again. Me and my brother move to Los Angeles California in hopes of creating a new sound within the fusion realm of rap, emo, metal, and pop genres. We moved with two of my friends from NY and got a shitty two bedroom apartment and split the rooms. The other two room mates were supposedly friends for years yet fought constantly, shit talked each other and created this crazy negative space in this 1000 sqft. It was not comfortable to say the least. However the one room mate in specific, targeted my brother, who at this point basically didn’t talk to either of them. (This is point one and point 2 is my confesssion) And then there was me, i had developed an alcohol problem, not that i drank every day or even every weekend. But when i did, i became a different person, i would usuallly drink myself to sleep as well. My brother picked me up from a bar one night and while on his way i began to get robbed. I refused it and tried to buy time and ended up running to his car when he got there. Amped on on about 10 jack n cokes and the adrenaline of potentially dying, i flipped shit on my brother. Cursing him out, saying i didn’t need him, i could pay someone 20 dollars to do what he does, etc. it was awful. And it was the last straw for him. Within the next week or so he packed up, quit his job and went back home. \n\nI was heartbroken, but covered it up with anger. My other two room mates, if you can believe it, convinced me that i didn’t need him and that he held me back. I thought I’d be okay and he’d come back, i left our room exactly how he left it for months. He didn’t. \n\nThis was the final nail in the coffin for my mental state to date. I spend every night analyzing the past, and i think I’ve learned that at first i created a whole identity to hating my father, then after that i created a whole identity around me and my brothers music career and once he was gone and to this second of typing it, I’m lost. I don’t know what to do. My personality feels like it’s splitting. Some days I’m this really cool extroverted ladies man guy and some days I’m a worm in my bed spending money he doesn’t have on post mates so he doesn’t have to leave the apartment. When i sit down and try to write music, i can, but i don’t feel it anymore. It’s the only skill i have. I didn’t go to a real college because of the deal, I’m not good at anything and I’m not interested in anything other than music. But there’s no inspiration left in me. Nothing really makes me happy anymore. I had a gf, nothing, broke up with her, nothing i have a new one, i miss her sometimes but for the most part nothing, i have written 6 new songs, nothing, i post a photo on Instagram, nothing, i go to work, nothing, i watch a movie, nothing. Everything just seems so pointless now, i don’t see myself as the star i once did. I don’t even believe myself when i sing, or have conversation with people. It’s like I’m watching the most boring movie about someone that i just don’t even care about. I just want him to die. I just want to stop wondering and working and fighting, i don’t want to do it anymore, and i was the relief of death. \n\nIdk what i expect from this but it was slightly therapeutic, thanks for listening.",

    "selftext": "I’m a 14 year old girl who’s weaker than average, I’m thin and short.\nI hate being a girl SO MUCH. More than anything. If one day I had proof of reincarnation, I’d kill myself and hope I come back as a boy.\nI’m scared of men, I’m scared because men are stronger. I HATE that men are stronger. It’s the most humiliating thing. I hate being built for childbirth, I hate having a bigger chest and wider hips. It’s embarrassing. I want more than anything to be a boy. \nI look really feminine too, and I hate it so much. I’m seriously thinking about just ending it all.\nI wish I was a boy so that I would be stronger, but also because I want to look like a boy and be treated like a boy and perceived like a boy. Being a teenage girl in this disgusting, misogynistic world is the most demeaning and humiliating thing ever. Knowing that I’m living off of peoples mercy.\nI even have fantasies where I’m a boy and I look like a boy and I do things that I see my brother and father doing. In an ideal world, I’d be a man who loves and protects girls just like me so that they won’t have to feel this way. I want to fight and be strong, and everyone, including biologists, tell me I’ll never even compete to men, so I don’t even try. I don’t exercise, I don’t do anything. I’m severely depressed and anxious. I’m completely paranoid of the people around me, especially men. And It’s not just that, it’s that I want to BE a man just because I do. I want facial hair and a deep voice and thicker eyebrows and an Adam’s apple. I’m just so tired of this. I think I’m just going to end it all, because I can’t be a boy. I’ve gone through thinking about transitioning, but the world is so cruel and hateful towards trans people and I’m scared. The place I’m in has anti trans laws too. So I can’t be trans for my own safety. I’m just stuck being a girl. So it’s two choices:\nBe a girl or die.\n\nEdit:\nGuys I’m sorry for gender stereotyping.\nThere isn’t an excuse for my behaviour.\nI’m sorry to all the people who I’ve offended and I’m sorry for undermining transmen issues and trying to include myself in them when I don’t belong in that space. I feel like I was being overly dramatic this entire time and I’m sorry to everyone who I’ve caused worry to. Just because I’m sad does not mean I have the right to dump that on other people. I’m sorry everyone.\nTo everyone telling me to just go to a therapist or a professional, you’re right. It wasn’t right for me to throw my problems at a bunch of strangers.\nI’ll call a helpline instead. Thank you for all the help and support.\n\nEdit again:\nUpon looking at these comments, I’ve come to the conclusion that being a guy sucks too. Being a girl also sucks. Being nonbinary also sucks. People will continue to hate me for the rest of my life no matter what I do. Based on my gender, but also my race. So I think I am going to kill myself.\nI think in reality, I just hate being human, being a person. I hate existing. Maybe this didn’t have much to do with gender at all. I think maybe I just hate myself and everything else. I don’t want to be a girl, I don’t have to be a boy, I don’t want to be anything. The only thing I genuinely want to be is something disgusting. Something people won’t come near or bother. Like a corpse, or a vampire, or a maggot. I don’t like myself and I’m coming to realize I don’t like many people either. I really appreciate all your guy’s help and advice though.\n\nEdit again again: please stop using she/her for me. I understand that it’s confusing because I referred to myself as a girl here, but I feel like I keep commenting and telling people and they don’t seem to listen? Maybe I’m looking too deep into it. But please don’t. Thank you.\n\nEdit again again again: guys can we please stop being so hostile to each other? I didn’t mean for this post to have dozens of angry arguments and profanity under it.\n\nEdit for the millionth time:\nAt first, when I posted this, I was just very depressed and upset. Now I’m angry.\nI posted this to a SUICIDE subreddit looks for support, advice, conversation, or just a listening ear. But for some reason people are arguing with each other, being transphobic, calling other people names and even slurs?? Not to mention the amount of transphobic people trying to ‘defend’ me against the ‘trans agenda’ when I do not need defending of any sort, because I don’t want it. I’m fine. This was a post about how I’m experiencing a difficult time, not an invitation to harass others and deliberately speak over me and try to talk for me. Can we please just stop swearing at each other and attacking each other? This is honestly making me lose hope is society even further.\n\nEdit again: guys stop talking about me getting pregnant. It’s really uncomfortable. I made this post to look for help and support. Instead I have lost faith in people and I’m honestly feeling worse. I’m 14, don’t pull that ‘oh but you might change your mind later’ because I don’t care. There are more reasons to me not being able to have a child that you guys don’t know about. I didn’t even mention pregnancy in this. I really wish people would stop bringing it up. I literally CANNOT be a mother, I’m too unstable and I can’t handle noise. I’m scared of children and I’m severely germaphobic. There are more reasons that I don’t want to list because this post is NOT about me getting pregnant! Stop. Please stop assuming you know me better than I know myself. I really REALLY don’t appreciate it. So stop.\n\nEdit: I hate it here. I really thought that going on a suicide support subreddit would help me.\nI know I said to ‘be respectful’ and ‘stop using profanity’ but fuck you guys. Not all of you guys, some of you are really sweet. But really. I’ve officially lost faith in the internet, strangers, and human nature. For some reason someone was talking about how ‘being a woman is an opportunity for me to be a stripper’??? What the fuck??? I’m 14, that’s literally the FIRST line of this post. But I can thank you all for something, thank you for reminding me why parents sometimes say ‘stranger danger’ because you guys are seriously pushing me closer to just ending it all—FOR AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT REASON. Now I just want to kill myself because I hate the world AND myself. So thank you for that. I really appreciate it. And also, I KNOW people have it worse than me, okay? I don’t need a reminder 10x a fucking hour. I’m just so sick of this shit and I’m sick of people in general. I really hoped that this would be a nice supportive subreddit where people could maybe give me advice, and they did! But like half of the people here are literally just subtly encouraging me. ",

This left me severely mentally I’ll. Boarderline personality disorder, skitzo-affective disorder, bipolar 1, and C-PTSD. I’ve been assessed 3 times so each doctor has a slightly different opinion, but those are the words they chose to diagnose me with. Irregardless of what they say, the symptoms are absolute hell.

    "selftext": "Throwaway account.  Daughter(14) tried to commit suicide Sunday night by taking a lethal dose of Tylenol and Advil.  Luckily school has been hitting the suicide hot line pretty hard with the students and she texted them before and after taking the pills.  They were able to convince her to give up our address.  Wife and I were home and had no idea until a frantic police man came up to the door.  Long story short, she survived with no permanent damage.  She started inpatient care yesterday.  We went thru her phone and the texts to the hot line indicate she has been having these feelings for two years.  We started going thru her room today and found her note.  It was addressed to her best friend and didn't even mention my wife and I.  That was a gut punch.  This was so out of the blue.  She is such a great kid.  Fantastic grades, lots of friends, very well liked at school, and highly empathetic towards others.  In her texts to the hot line, she was guilt ridden on how good her life was.  She couldn't understand why her life was so good when many others around her struggle with single parents, bad parents, poor, etc while she seems to have it all.  This is tearing me up.  We meet with the social worker tomorrow.  I assume family sessions will occur at some point.  She is on fall break this week, so her absence from school won't be noticed, but if she is out when school starts back up next week it is going to be harder and harder to explain.  I want her to stay as long as needed inpatient, but I'm scared how cruel teenagers can be if it gets out at school.  How do you manage all of this?",

    "selftext": "I tried I really did, but the second I took the pills I instantly regretted it. I called 911. In the ambulance is when I really noticed what I had done. And having the paramedics there to calm me down and help me was everything to me. I'm currently in the hospital. I can't leave my room unless it's to go to the bathroom. I can't even close my curtain to get privacy. They took every single cable and metal object out of the room. I'm in terrible pain. I didn't sleep at all last night. Hospital beds are the worse. I miss my bed and my dog :( \n\nDespite the dreary scene of the hospital the nurses and doctors have been nothing but nice and supportive. The nurse who drew my blood even drew a little smiley face on my bandaid to cheer me up a little. One nurse even gave me her number in case I ever need some support. I've never been treated so nicely by a group of strangers. Every single one of them giving me a different purpose to live. Thankfully I didn't ingest too much pills to damage my body too much. Just slight kinda damage but nothing life threatening. \n\nBut this has made me realize a lot. Life really is worth living. No matter your situation. There are PLENTY of people who can be there for you. Every single nurse and doctor here gave me thousands of resources to help me. And this has given me the will to live. \n\nI should be getting out by Tuesday when a psychiatrist comes to mentally evaluate me and give me permission to leave. Until then I'm in a hospital room prison being watched over like a baby but it's good to know that there's people out there who truly care. \n\nTo all the people considering suicide. Please don't do it. It's not worth it. I truly thought I had no one and my family wouldn't care. But seeing their crying faces when the ambulance took me away made me realize that even when you think you have no one you're wrong. The selfish decision I made will be in my mind forever but it gives me a reason to go on. We're all strong enough if we really try. \n\nStay strong and reconsider your choice. \n\n\nEDIT: I didn't think my post would get so much attention, seeing as my other posts wouldn't get much. I'm sorry if I can't reply to all of the comments it's really a lot! However, thank you to all the kind people and positive messages. I'm glad to see my story is helping others as well. ",

    "selftext": "I found my best friend dead from hanging herself just under 3 weeks ago now, I called the ambulance and untied her and gave her CPR for 12-14 minutes before anyone showed up. They ended up working on her for 60-90 minutes and got a faint heart beat back and she was put into an induced coma. I had to call her boyfriend and ex/best friend and we all spent the night in the ICU. I spent a week in shock, meeting her parents who flew in from interstate. Her father thanked me for giving them the opportunity to say goodbye to her. For the first  6 days it seemed there was such a low chance of her making any kind of recovery that we were just waiting for her family to decide to withdraw life support. I had begun grieving, although I was by her bed most days and evenings brushing her hair talking to her and reading to her from our favorite poetry books. On about day 6/7 they decided to take her off sedation and see what would happen and she ended up opening her eyes in front of me for the first time. It was a miracle, and it was also the saddest part reflectively of the entire experience. All she could do was lay and sob. I spent a few days with her like this. I would talk to her and I knew she could hear me because there would be certain things she would cry about and then certain things I would say would calm her back down. It was so incredibly painful. I was convinced over these days I had ruined her life by doing what I did. She was dead when I found her and that I had brought her back to a life of hell. It was my worst fear that she would stay in that state forever, I just couldn’t wrap my head around how incredibly unjust that would be. She ended up within 24 hours of having her breathing tube taken out and her sedation completely ceased able to start breathing on her own, speaking a little and even started moving. It’s all been so surreal. Now that shock has worn off I’m having constant flash backs and panic attacks. I have constant invasive thoughts of killing my self. It’s so painful. I truly want to die, I feel so conflicted and invisible. Because she is recovering our mutual friends almost have forgotten just how traumatic this experience has been for her first and foremost (and realistically this is only just the beginning of a very painful road for her...) and traumatised I am from finding her, untying her, giving her cpr while I knew she was dead, cleaning the blood off the door she was hanging from, and spending 2 straight weeks by her side through every single state in ICU. I even moisturised her arms and legs so her scars would heal properly because nobody was doing it for her. I’m so heart broken. I want to die. I feel invisible and I don’t know where to put my pain. I have nobody because it’s too heavy for anyone to deal with, and all our mutual friends just want to focus on the positives that she is recovering which I understand but it’s like they don’t understand that she hung herself. I’m traumatised for life, and her life is changed for ever even if she does make a full recovery which who knows—she’s still very brain damaged and doesn’t even know what’s happened to Her. I have never posted before, I don’t know anyone who’s had any kind of similar experience. It’s so layered and I have a 11 year history of self harm and drug use, both of which I had recovered from, years since I have self harmed and 3 months since I have used drugs or alcohol, but all I want to do is hurt myself in anyway I can.\n\nEdit: she had hung herself on the back of her door, so by opening her bedroom door that’s how she was released from hanging. I called 000 immediately as I untied the belt from her neck and checked if she was breathing or had a heart beat. All I did was find her and untie her and try wake her up realise she was very obviously dead/not conscious and call 000 and then do what they told me to until anyone arrived because I was in so much shock I was just doing what they were telling me to, even when the woman was like you need to somehow get into that room and I had to kick her desk back and squeeze my way into her bedroom I had no idea why the woman was saying she needed to be laid out flat on her back until all of a sudden the woman was telling me to give her mouth to mouth then I realised I was about to do CPR. I was screaming and crying why are you making me do this she’s dead the entire time and the woman just kept saying I know *my name* but just keep helping her until help gets there. So I did",

I put it towards my thigh at the last moment pulled the trigger and a 9mm defense round went through my thigh. I spent 2 weeks in emergency then 3 weeks in psych. 4 years later I'm still here. Got a nice scar on my right thigh. My mental health has been suffering bad this year dealing with an injury for 6 months from broken bones in ankle and a completely shredded ligament.  I get surgery on it in a couple weeks. I went to bed last night telling myself if I woke up sad I'd finish what I started 4 yrs ago. But I'm still here. My cat is curled up next to my injured ankle and I'm trying to be strong. Trauma memories get the best of me this time of year from a lifetime of abuse but I'm thankful for the positive people I do have in my life. I'm thankful for my cat. I'm still here. For today. I'm here.\n\n\nEdited for misspelling *\nEdited again to add this = I shot my thigh because I had to feel something but something made me not shoot my temple so the thigh made sense to me at the time. Like I had to use the weapon on myself that I needed to feel it. It's too much to type to try to explain it. Therapist is helping me try to make sense of it. That numbness and need for pain stems from years of abuse ad well as self harm. I can show pic if necessary for those who doubt. It is a tw though.",

She's super rich and difficult to please, and my family isn't terribly poor but we're low income and a wreck. \n\nI recently went to the doctor for my mental health issues, I never tell them I'm suicidal because I know what'll happen if I even mention suicidal thoughts. I've been on two different medications for the past few months and neither of them seem to produce any affect. \n\nMy sister who used to abuse me severely as a kid came over the other day, we're both adults now and I think we get along okay, I never really talk to her. Shes kind of psychotic and paranoid beyond fuck, I think she may have schizophrenia or something fucked. But she came in and she said to me, \"OK OP WE ALL KNOW I DID TERRIBLE STUFF TO YOU AS A KID BUT IF YOU COULD PLEASE STOP TELLING EVERYONE ABOUT IT THAT WOULD BE COOL. STOP MAKING ME FEEL LIKE SHIT.\" And she went on and on about how I was telling everyone just to turn on her and what not. When I do open up about what she did to me as a kid, in the rare times that I do, I only mention things really briefly and I never say things like, \"she did this horrible thing now go attack her about it.\" I just say what happened and that's it. My dad was sitting in the room, and my dad has older siblings and she was like, \"DAD YOU HAVE OLDER SIBLINGS, IM SURE THEY DID SHITTY THINGS TO YOU AS A KID, BUT YOU NEVER WENT OUT OF YOUR WAY TO MAKE THEM FEEL LIKE SHIT ABOUT IT.\" \n\nNow to top it all off, its my mom's birthday today. And the house is a wreck as usual because she refuses to ever clean. I stay in my room 24/7 and never really clean down there because none of it is my mess, its 90% my mom's own messes, mixed with kids. And my dad came in this morning and woke me up and said, \"do you think you could help mom clean today? It's her birthday.\" And I said yeah, and went back to sleep cause it's still morning and we have all day. I was awoken by my mom downstairs at 8 am screeching demonically and throwing stuff and screaming about how much she hates her life, she hates the kids, she hates that I'm a loser who stays in her room all day, she wished I was never born, and a lot of other hurtful and hateful things.\n\nIf I didnt have more of a reason to end my life then idk what would be. \n\nI'm scared to go down there, I was gonna help her clean today but I really dont want to now, birthday or not. \n\nI'm not sure what I'm gonna do. I havent cut myself in a long time and it is really tempting right now to brutally injure myself and or kill myself. I wish we had a gun.",

    "selftext": "She has had the toughest life of anyone I've ever known, and yet she's the kindest, most loving person I've ever known. We fit together in so many ways we've never come close to before. We make each other feel normal when the rest of the world does the opposite.\n\nRecently, her anxiety skyrocketed, and she had been a bit more receptive to discussing getting some help (past trauma included incidents related to therapy and psych treatment). I asked again Wednesday night when she started getting antsy again after a calm, positive day. She said she would \"get there,\" she would be ready soon.\n\nHer anxiety spiked a little later that night, and she got upset with me over a very minor misunderstanding. It threw me at first, but I realized it was her anxiety talking and did what I could to help her calm down. The anxiety didn't seem as bad at it had been in nights leading up to that.\n\nWe snuggled up in bed and went to sleep. I woke up in the night and noticed she was very tightly holding onto me. She didn't move much when I got up, just kinda rolled over. Same thing when I came back to bed.\n\nI got up for work later, and she apologized for being mean the night before. I apologized for not realizing what was going on at first. Nothing seemed amiss, but she's tough, and mornings are hectic.\n\nShe sent the usual sweet message while I was on my way in. Then right after my work day started (and she knew I couldn't get messages for a while), she messaged that she needed to be committed. When I got the message, I asked if she was in danger and messaged our trusted friends near the house. She had reached out to them already, and they were there.\n\nThey took her to the ER, she went from there to inpatient.\n\nShe took 2500 mg of benadryl. I'm not sure how she woke up. She didn't mean to wake up.\n\nThe misunderstanding and everything happened later the night before, and she took the pills before that.\n\nAnyway. She has been receiving inpatient treatment for a couple days. She just got cleared to receive the clothes I dropped off her first night in there. She got a fork at dinner tonight.\n\nWe've been able to talk a handful of times. She sounds better and more hopeful each time. I'm so proud of her for finally agreeing to get the help she needs, and I cannot fathom how hard this is for her.\n\nDue to COVID restrictions, no one can have visitors, so she has short phone calls, and she has the photos and books I dropped off. And she has time. She is doing the work and going to sessions and everything (confirmed by her nurses). She is feeling hopeful. She said she was really happy about today.\n\nI'm so glad she's getting help. I know she's in good hands. The facility she's at is local, and I have friends who gave family who've been greatly helped by then, too. I'm also feeling lost being less than a mile from her but unable to give her a hug or even look into her eyes.\n\nWe have a small but tight support network of friends, and I don't feel like harming myself. I just don't feel like doing anything other than calling her. \n\nSorry if this is the wrong sub. I looked a bit and couldn't find a better fit, and I needed to get this out there.\n\nUpdate: I just got word that she's been cleared to come home. She has medications to be picked up at the pharmacy, and she has follow up sessions scheduled.\n\nI can't thank you all enough for the kindness and support you've sent our way here. Each night of this has been rough, but last night felt particularly miry. I posted here because, although I have good friends whom I can talk to admit this, and who came through the other day and got her to help while I was gone, I felt a need to just say the story to people who didn't know, who don't know, what was going on or don't know us, etc.\n\nI am so happy she is coming home, and I am so hopeful for the future. I know the struggle is not over, and it's one that will likely go on as long as we're alive (just like my own struggles with mental health), but I am supremely optimistic at the change in her demeanor and her willingness to continue on the path to health and happiness. Together.\n\nThank you. As silly as it will seem to some people, your comments, messages, and everything have really helped.",

    "selftext": "January  8th 2020 I was driving home listening to Amy Winehouse and decided that this was my time. It was on a windy, empty country road, late at night, in torrential rain- accidents happened there all the time. I had just finished having dinner with my housemate at University and was on my way to my hometown to see my family. No one would suspect a thing. I closed my eyes, let go of the steering wheel and put my foot down. \n\nWhen I opened my eyes my vision was blurred, but I could see that my windshield had caved in. I proceeded to crawl out across the passenger seat, opening the door with my elbow as hands were covered in shards of glass. There was no shock, no confusion. I felt a small sense of relief that I wasn’t paralysed, and a bigger sense of relief that I hadn‘t hit anyone else. But other than that, I still felt just as dead inside as I had prior to the crash.\n\nI went through the motions. Strangers came to my aid, followed shortly by the paramedics and later my parents. I laughed and smiled through it, cracking jokes about ordering my preferred cocktail of pain relief and apologising for keeping everyone up so late. I had just survived a near fatal car crash and already the guilt and shame of everyone worrying about me was kicking in.\n\nI had aquaplaned across the road, accelerating into a hedge, before flipping my 2004 corsa four times, knocking down a row of silver birches in the process and spinning 20m down the country lane. I had landed upright but the roof of the car had moulded around my headrest. I’m only 5’2”, if I was a couple of inches taller my head would have been caved in. I should have been dead. \n\nInstead, I spent a week in hospital lying on my back, completely immobilised, awaiting my C7 spinal surgery. Post-surgery, my doctor told me he’d seen MRI scans like mine where the patient had already been paralysed, so I guess the fact that I walked out of hospital after 9 days with Just a neck brace was a silver lining. \n\nSince then I‘ve carried on keeping up appearances. Things have changed, some for the better, some for the worse. For a while, my frustration that I had survived was outweighed by my relief that I wasn’t paralysed, and in truth that is still the case. But my fear of putting my family through something like that again is starting to wear off. It‘s a constant fight between my happiness and their grief. What’s more important? Should I continue to suffer silently in a world where I feel completely lost and alone, just to postpone their mourning for what will eventually happen anyway?",

I don't want to be here anymore. it's not even so much out of sadness anymore as it is just out of thinking realistically. there's literally no point. the only thing holding me back from doing it is I don't want to do that to my parents. \nbesides feeling like I just want to be dead, I also deal with intense depression and thoughts that torment me. I can't shake the feeling that something is just wrong with me and I'm never going to be happy or deserve to be happy. there's this void in me and no matter what I do, nothing fills it. \n\nI tried talking to my ex about this while we were dating. I told him about my self harm and how I just want to die. about the self harm, he told me to cut the \"right way\" if I wanted real results. for the depression and suicidal thoughts, he said he felt the same except he had a worse life, so his depression was more justified. he said I have a lot to be happy for. \n\nit just made me want to kill myself even more. but the thing is, I don't think I want to die. I just wish everything would stop and I could start over as someone else. \nand honestly, when I think about killing myself, I fantasize about it not working, but working just enough to hospitalize me. it's a sick fucking thought, I know.\nI think the main reason I want to attempt suicide is so the people around me will realize that I'm not just faking it or \"choosing\" to be depressed. it's not just for attention... which is ironic to say, considering I want to do it literally to get their attention. but I just feel like, in order for my pain to be taken seriously, I need to show it to people somehow.",

I don’t know what else to do. Tried to work everywhere near me, I’ve applied at Johnnys Pizza House, Popeyes, FedEx, UPS, etc. Trying to find work in a desperate time so I can fix my car but nobody is giving me a chance. \n\nHonestly, days like today really bother me, I never had a dad and my mom raised me by herself the best she could and I’ll always respect her for that. Unfortunately she isn’t around to call on anymore and I think today is the day that we will rejoice. I miss you momma. I miss enjoying life like I did when I was a kid, I miss it so much. I wish I could find something that brings me joy. \n\nThe method I chose to go is by drowning. Something about the water. It’s peaceful, beautiful, and cold. I’ve lived in a very cold world lately and feel like it suits me. I don’t blame anyone for this besides myself. I was trying to decline a DoorDash order and next thing I know I wrecked the only thing that matters to me.\n\nI have nothing now. I don’t have income, I don’t have any food or money, I don’t have family, I don’t have friends, I’m just a lonely 23 year old who wants to escape a life that is beating my ass.

I've already scouted out where I want to do it. Not at my house since I don't want to scar my family any more than what they're already gonna be from this. I plan on doing it at my local park. It's got a big field way on the outskirts of it. Peaceful, with a good view of the stars too. I plan on waiting until everyone goes to sleep tonight, take my last shower at about 10 pm, and write 2 more on-paper notes. One for my family to find in my room, telling them to call the police and telling them the location of my body, and one on my body telling the police that my suicide letter is on my phone in my notes app. I'll walk to the park somewhere between 12 - 3 am and just look at the stars for a while. Might drink a little too, play some music. Once I've said my prayers and my last words, turn my gun onto myself, pull the trigger, and see what happens from there. These past few days have been strangely peaceful actually. Feels like I've got control of my life for once and that I actually know what's gonna happen.\n\nI'd like to thank everybody who left comments or sent me pms after my last post. All of you are amazing people and you will hopefully go on to do great things with your lives. Thank you for giving some comfort in my final days. 🖤\n\nIf I somehow survive or the gun jams I'll give you guys another update, but this is most likely gonna be my last post. Farewell everyone.\n\n\n                                                                        -O.\n\n\n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/s/JeOdNhUcVm)",

    "selftext": "Writing this here because bottling this up is killing me on the inside. The guilt and anxiety has been building for a decade and I just can't take it anymore.\n\nMy parents hired her when I was 10. I'd nearly burned the house down while home alone the month prior and they were too busy working to look after me themselves. My dad wanted a professional nanny but my mom insisted on hiring her childhood friend; I'll just call her Sarah. Sarah had just lost her job as a nurse and my mom wanted to help her get back on her feet.\n\nI hated her immediately. Her hair was ratty, her breath smelled like fish and she seemed to think cheap perfume was a substitute for bathing. The first few months were fine but she quickly started pushing boundaries. It's weird to say but she'd treat me like one of her girl friends. She'd go on for hours about abusive ex boyfriends and childhood bullies and drunken one night stands, always making sure to swear me to secrecy afterwards.\n\nMy clubs and sports were my only time I got away from her but she convinced my parents that they were interfering with my grades and got me pulled out of them. After a year, my routine was coming straight home, hanging out with Sarah for 6 hours and going to sleep. I'm not going into detail but that's when the assaults began.\n\nMy grades immediately took a hit and so did my sleep. It all came to a head one day when I got a detention for falling asleep during a test. My dad was called in and after a few minutes of him questioning me about what was going on, I told him everything. That's the closest I ever saw him get to crying. When we got home, he and mom had an hour long screaming match where both blamed the other for 'letting this happen.' I was scared but also hopeful that it might finally be over.\n\nHowever, the next night when I came home from school the energy had changed completely. Sarah was at the table along with both my parents and it looked like they'd been talking for some time. They told me to sit and asked if I had anything to say for myself. I asked what they meant and my mom said that Sarah had told her everything.\n\nApparently, Sarah had spent the day making me out to be some sort of sex obsessed pervert who'd been harassing and groping her for months. She had flipped every accusation I'd made back around on me and, infuriatingly, my parents had sided with her. I obviously denied all of it at first but after an hour and a half of my dad grilling me and picking my words apart I began to think it really was my fault. By the end of the conversation, I was tearfully apologizing to Sarah for my disgusting behavior and promising to never lie again.\n\nThe next day when I got home Sarah was there again. She made me say sorry for sharing 'our secret' and the assaults began again. It continued like that for another 3 years and this time I stopped trying to resist. Normally I'd spend my days brainstorming ways to avoid her but by then I'd figured there was nothing I could do. I developed a sort of helplessness that killed all my motivation and followed me long after she was gone.\n\nI know it could have been worse but the ordeal really screwed up how I see things. I've been depressed, anxious and friendless ever since with no signs of it changing. I have mild pancreatitis from drinking and scars on my arms from self harm. When I try talking to my parents about it they just gaslight me. I've tried church, therapy and meds but nothing works. I just don't want to feel like this anymore.",

All help lines ive tried are also shit, so I’ve resorted to reaching out online and sometimes to people I know in real life. \n\nSometimes when I’m panicking I’ll tell someone that I want to kill myself in the hopes that they’ll respond with something that will make me feel better.

It didn’t really feel like a true suicide attempt. More like it blurred the lines between ‘self harm’ and ‘suicide’. Before the jump I had figured a ~90% chance I’d live if the water was deep (I was gambling a lot on that “if”). \n\nWhen I got home I told my family, thinking they would just let me go to sleep with some asprin, maybe take the next day off. Nope. Not a chance. We went *straight* to the ER. Then I was volunteered to go to the inpatient psychiatric unit. \n\nThe psych ward. I was pretty terrified. I didn’t think I was worthy of such care. My issues were mild, weren’t they? It was just (extreme) self harm. \n\nI spent five days in the hospital. And frankly they were some of the most incredible days I’ve ever experienced in my life. I dealt with both extreme pain and euphoria. At several points, I *was* the hysterical, crying, inconsolable woman who you’d expect to find in a padded room wearing a straight jacket. \n\nBut they didn’t do that to me. They talked to me, and they helped me. They gave me the mental and emotional tools to help myself.

I’m trying to remember, every minute of every day, that I *do* deserve to live. \n\nAnyway... that’s kinda my little story. \n\nTL;DR: Jumped off a bridge, landed in a psych ward, got legit help.\n\nEdit: wow thanks for the support everyone! I’ll try to answer your questions in more detail when I get a chance.\n\nEdit 2: this got a bit more attention than I thought, but I’m glad.

You don't even want to die, just for your reality to be fundamentally different, but that's obviously not how this all works.\n\nSo, you're stuck in this hell that's been aptly described like the mental equivalent to a burning building, and there's no grand purpose to it - there's no big meaning or reward for suffering through it - you just had really bad luck. You just happened to be the organism born to become self-aware within an absolutely shitty situation, to the point many people  objectively admit you were, and now you've got to either take it or leave it and both options feel pretty horrible, but one at least feels like a solution in that this whole situation simply ends.\n\nThe thing is, too, I bet if it was somehow possible for a person that feels normal, or god forbid, happy, to experience this feeling for a day, they'd totally understand wanting to leave it and be incredibly grateful they've never spent a day in the desperate void that leads one to truly consider suicide.\n\nSo, fuck it.",

I don’t want them to see me so vulnerable like this.

While playing ps4 in my sons room, (son is sleeping at his friends house) he found a goodbye letter sort of in plain sight. My son has one of those beds that’s like a bunk bed but the bottom part is all shelving and his mattress is close to the ceiling. The letter was open on the top of it. He hadn’t been snooping, (he was putting the controller up there) but this discovery sent him into snoop mode and he then found a green handled box cutter in the closet which does not belong to us. He refuses to tell me the full content of the letter but added that it included a will in which he delegated some of his belongings to his youngest siblings in his absence. I couldn’t possibly express how heartbroken and terrified I am. I feel this is a nightmare. My husband called the suicide hotline and has some numbers to call on Tuesday to get him into therapy (Monday is a holiday and he does not want to immediately go the inpatient route). I think I am going to ask the friends mother to keep him there until then because i feel he is safer socializing and having fun with his friend and is lower risk in that situation than being home in his room. My husband is also calling off work and using family leave until we meet with a professional. In the event he comes home before we get an appointment, I am thinking I will set an alarm to check up on him every 15 minutes or try to keep him w me at all times by watching movies, games, walking etc. I am afraid to bring it up to him before hand because maybe he will be so caught off guard and feel so ashamed that he won’t want to deal even more so. He must’ve bought the cutter himself because he walks to target sometimes. Or would his friend have given it to him? A few weeks back he said he should have the code to the safe where we keep our gun (home protection) and know it’s location in case of an intruder and we are not home. He’s only home alone with his 11 YO sister when I pick up my youngest and that’s at the most 45 minutes. He also has 0 training so I did not tell him the location or the code. I am nauseated thinking he asked about it for this…and maybe it might have already happened had I made that mistake for some stupid reason. Why is he so intent, he’s so young and so smart. He’s been struggling with grades but I thought he was making a turn around with the new semester. Idk what I’m doing but I CANNOT get this wrong.",

No one actually gives a fuck.\n\nIt’s great how I live every day wanting to kill myself and if I show any sign of not being happy I either get screamed at and berated or I get fake sympathy from people who forget about me the second after I stop talking to them. Nobody actually cares. I could kill myself and I doubt anyone would even notice for a while. Everyone will just go on with their merry little life and I’ll be forgotten. I can’t wait for that to happen, because existing in this bullshit life just sucks. Every day sucks and it gets worse every day. What is the fucking point \n",

    "selftext": "I have never actually been actively suicidal, but the thought has been there ever since my early teens when something pretty traumatic happened to me. It was sort of a back door, you know? But never something I considered going through with in a near future. I didn't have a plan or anything really, but the thought of having a way out was comfort enough. Really, the simple thought that \"this won't last forever, it will all end some day\" was usually enough to keep me from feeling panicked and claustrophobic for simply being alive.\n\nAnd growing up I naïvely thought that life would just automatically get better without me actually putting in the time and effort to make it so. The prospect of becoming an unemployed, depressed and washed up adult didn't even occur to me. I was convinced that by this time I would either be dead or having gotten my shit together, have a decent job and maybe even a steady relationship. This in-between sad existence was something I didn't expect. 13 year old me would be so disappointed.\n\nNow I'm at a stage in life where I'm still young, but I've managed to ruin basically everything I had going for me in life. If I had put in the effort I could have gone places. But here I am, borderline-alcoholic, depressed, used up and hating myself. Through my careless, self destructive lifestyle I've gotten myself a bad reputation, allowed people to take advantage of me and used and abused other people and more or less hurt myself in every way possible, physically and mentally. I'm scarred and damaged inside and out. I'm a shell. I've gone out of my way to make sure I get to see the very worst of human kind by spending my time with others who hate themselves and life as much as I do. I've destroyed so much I don't even know if I have more to lose. I feel like a bottomless hole of hatred, rage and contempt for myself and everyone else. I can't feel happiness, I can't love. I can't feel anything but shame, regret and anger. I resent myself for allowing life to get this bad. I'm not considering suicide now, but part of me wishes that teenage me would have just ended things before this shitshow began, so I wouldn't have to live down this long walk of shame. I thought there would be some kind of reward or feeling of pride at this point for fighting to stay alive. But all I get is more and more shit thrown at me. It never ends. Life just deteriorates and I feel like a zombie.",

    "title": "Please read this if you have the time.",
    "selftext": "I'm really hoping somebody sees this, even if that seems selfish.\n\nMaybe this isn't the right place for this. I'm new to this whole Reddit thing, so I was pretty shocked when I found this subreddit. the world is pretty crazy these days, I guess. I have no clue how many people will see this, or if anyone will see it, but I just need a place to vent. So, here's a not-so-short summary of my entire life story.\n\nI was born at a very young age in Korea to a woman and a man (who already had another child, my sister) in a crippling amount of debt. I moved to Canada after a couple of years of living in Korea, my father's irresponsible investments and petty crime following us from across the globe.\n\nI was four when my mother hit me for the first time. I don't remember the particular instance, but it was then for sure. To me, it seemed as if my mother would go out of her way to hit me whenever the opportunity arose. ANY opportunity at all. She would beat me senseless for not cleaning my room or eating too slow, or whatever other trivial matter she felt like punishing me for. There have been far too many instances in my life so far, where I, an innocent child, has cowered at the hands of her mother, thinking it was the end. She has made me fear for my life on numerous accounts.\n\nI was in the third grade when I called my mom a bitch for the first and last time. I just remember being so insanely frustrated with the way she treated me, and the way she was so much more accepting and lax when it came to disciplining my older sister. I muttered it with seething anger on my way out the door that day. She called the school I was attending at the time and told them I was \"sick\". She kept me home and beat me with a metal music stand, aiming for my head, my throat, and just about anywhere else she figured she could land a blow. This went on until my barely present father came home from work. I was sent to school the next day, being given a kiss before I left as if the day before had never happened.\n\nMy school performance was never awful. in fact, it was more the opposite. I was considered somewhat of a child prodigy. School was the one place I felt I could truly thrive, if ever. I did have what I would consider seriously awful behaviour in school, as I would lash out at other children with the same violent tendencies as my mother. This was not brought to anybody's attention, so for a very long time, which means it was not corrected until much later in my life.\n\nThe (abusive?) cycle kept going the way it was, with her beating the shit out of me for the sake of discipline, and then acting if she was some sort of saint the very next day, with not even a hint of guilt or remorse on her face. I remember being in the fourth grade, sick of being \"disciplined\". I picked up our landline and looked her in the eye,\n\n\"I'm going to call the police and tell them everything you do to me.\" And she said,\"Go ahead, nobody is going to help you.\" I felt completely defeated. There was no help for me. There was no escape. Even at the tender age of 9, I started to feel as if there was no escape but death. I felt as if I couldn't talk to anyone about this. 'Mom would probably hit me again.' 'Dad is never home.' ' I know she wouldn't get it.' I knew that if I talked about it at school, that legal troubles were sure to ensue, so I kept my mouth shut for a long time.\n\nAnother memorable instance happened in the fifth grade, when my mother fell insanely ill out of nowhere. we were at the pool. She seemed to be completely fine just moments before, but now she was seemingly dying in a changing stall, telling me to get her help over and over again. And I didn't. Call me a heathen. I stood right in front of the stall door and prayed with all my heart and soul that she would just die and leave me alone. She didn't. Some days I still wish that she did.\n\nFast forward just a little more. There I was, a tender 11, resentful and bitter at the world. I didn't give a shit about anything. I just wanted it to be over. My school performance started to slip, I just couldn't understand like I could before. Anything and Everything was insanely distracting, and I took to watching anime and gameplay videos as a means of escape from the world. Somehow, my hungover teacher would still find any excuse to give me a good mark, and I was still considered a prodigy, despite my near fail scores. I couldn't do math to save my life, but because of the way I was treated, I would chant to myself 'at least I'm smart' to make me feel better about it all. I was accepted into an academic challenge program for junior high, which only further inflated my ego.\n\nWhen I got to my brand new school, I realized a couple of things: 1. Years of being violent towards my peers left me completely unapproachable. 2. I had extreme trust issues. 3. I was fucking stupid compared to my peers. I so badly wanted junior high to be my break, my way out. I wanted so badly for everything to get better. But I couldn't make any new friends (probably because I was terrifying, we're talking descriptive death threats left and right) and my academics were not improving at all. Focusing was near impossible. I couldn't ever shut my mouth. Everyone hated me. I was at an all time low, and I still didn't have a single soul to tell this to. I couldn't trust those kids at school, they'd hand me over to the police like I was nothing. I never wanted that. I desperately wanted to put my past behind me. My mom had stopped beating me (only after figuring that her multiple illnesses made her weaker than I was) but it still felt as if she would strike again at any moment. I was living on edge at home and school. I managed to raise myself a little, teaching myself to trust little by little. Teaching myself what was morally acceptable. Anything to make me even one friend.\n\nEighth grade was somewhat of a breeze. I had friends, and people seemed to no longer think I was terrifying. But of course, in a cruel world such as this, nothing can ever be completely good. my grades were slipping hard. I procrastinated to the end of my life, and every assignment I handed in was complete shit. Things didn't really improve family wise either. My mom would be pissed at me if I was sick and bedridden, since that's an inconvenience to her. My dad was drunk every single day and my sister was starting to become a second mother. Definitely not ideal, but I would fight my way through it. look at what I had already overcome!\n\nNinth grade. shit. I realized that people didn't actually like me. To everyone, I was just a background character, nothing more than a forgettable nobody. I felt invisible, like I was talking and people just didn't even care that I was there. This is also the year I was diagnosed with ADHD. Family didn't take it well, or rather they just didn't take it. None of them have really bothered to look into ADHD at all, nobody asked the doctor any questions, none. Zip. Nada. My parents don't give a damn. They've made no means to learn about it. They just pump me full of what's essentially meth as medication and hope I shut the fuck up. They don't reprimand my older sister calling me retarded at any given chance. Nothing. It's awful knowing that because of this, I'll never be normal. Nevertheless, I kept working towards self improvement. I was making good progress. I really thought I had a shot at getting better and fully escaping my past-\n\nnope. quarantine. I'm stuck at home with my family. My mom has definitely calmed down, but I know that deep down she resents me. Now, my sister is my biggest enemy. She truly is my second mother. She belittles me constantly, insulting me and disregarding me. Worst of all, she pretends she's a fucking saint, just like my mother. When I confront her about the things she does, all I get is a\n\n\"No I don't, I don't have any idea what you're talking about!\" And then she just keeps on hanging around in my room pretending like we're best friends, as if she didn't call me a defective retard the other day.\n\nAnd here I am now, washed up at 14, unable to recover from my past. Broken forever. Defective. Stupid. Unmotivated. Invisible to the world. I want to end it all. I have nothing to lose. I am nothing. I purposefully omitted my current age until the end of the post because I didn't want people to think I was a \"sad girl\" or just a typical teenager. The more I read this though, the more I'm starting to think I am just stupid teenager who needs to be disregarded. My feelings are invalid. I hate myself.\n\nIf anyone is really out here, and I'm not completely invisible, please say something. I don't want to be alone anymore. I don't think I can do this anymore. I don't want to be alone anymore. Please.",

    "title": "I killed my girlfriend, and now I want to kill myself..",
    "selftext": " \n\nBefore you read my true story, I want you to know that I'm not very good at English, as it's my second language so bare with me if I have made grammatical mistakes or anything, and honestly I really haven't opened up about this incident in my life, until today.\n\nAnyway,\n\nThis one random late night in March 2017, I decided to download the Tinder app (probably the worst decisions in my life) , but I'm genuinely a introvert person, so it's hard for me to make conversation on spot to get to know people. Most people hop on tinder to troll, some to get laid but I was on it to find \"true love\". Fast forward to two months of most girls wanting to just party or I was to boring to form a conversation, this one random day I got super liked by this girl named Laura. We both started to talk, we both had a lot of similarities between us and she was literally 2 miles away from my place. It had been 2 weeks, we both still haven't meet but our conversations started to get more personal, and I felt a real connection between us two. We both replied long, it used to take me a good 45mins to an hour to reply, it was just how it was. It was however odd for me that she was really beautiful, and I was a ugly mf. She came from a small town family, where as me, I was a city kid, from a wealthy family (although she didn't know that for along time).\n\nAfter the 2 weeks of talking, we both decided to meet up for lunch. Like when I say she was simple, she had no idea about brands or anything. I dressed up with some yeezy 750s, she didn't even know them. And some part of me liked that she was like that, because most of the times, I only wore to show off, to feel rich, to feel accepted. One thing about being rich is that, the definition of happiness is so different to what a average person would say. Like an average person has aspirations of having a nice house, a nice car, nice gadgets and all but it's different being born wealthy, like I had everything that anyone would aspire of having, it's different when you have everything. Anyway that just made me like Laura more because she was a simple person, a bit mysterious and I was always curious to know more about her.\n\nWe ended up dating for 6 months, and I knew she was the one for me, she was beautiful, she loved me for who I was, I didn't have to pretend to be this cool dude like I did with my friends, she loved the sensitive little bitch I was. Everything was going well, till (Jan 2018) she called and cried, her father was diagnosed with lung cancer at a bad stage, the doctors said they could cure it but he would only survive for a couple of months. Laura was going through some tough times, but I was always with her, trying to make her strong. She would tell me stories about her dad, like how they used to horse ride back when they used to live on farm lands, and how he would work 14 hours everyday just his both daughters could have the life that every other kid had. Tbh that got me so depressed, like the fact that her father sacrificed so much for his kids and all. But no matter what had happened over the next few months, years or the next decade or so, i said to myself that I would always be with Laura, and I wanted to marry her.\n\nWe got back to our casual routines, she was getting better and better, and on her birthday 11th of March, I proposed to her, I honestly didn't know if it was the right time or not, but I felt like I needed to tell her that I'm gonna be committed and not just saying it but i wanted to show her. Laura said yes, cried and hugged so hard that I thought she would break my bones, but I knew that this meant a lot to her.\n\nApril 11th 2018.\n\nThis part is going to be hard for me, as I am typing my fingers are twitching, I'm really scared, because to say it out is something i haven't done... Anyway, on this very day, I picked up Laura, we were driving to the hospital to visit her dad, we went on the highway. Till this high speeding car (prolly doing 150kmph) tried to overtake a vechile in front of us so we were behind this car, but suddenly suddenly the person slammed the brakes and dropped back, causing me to smash into the car. After this moment, I don't remember a thing. It felt like I died, I could hear my surroundings but I couldn't see anything, Idk how long or anything I woke up and the first thing I asked was \"what happened to laura?\" and my mum started to cry but i thought she was crying for me. I kept asking, and no one replied. Then it hit me, it hit me that she's not alive, and i couldn't understand. It all happened in a flash of a second.. The love of my life was gone, and I could do nothing about it, i didn't know how to take it in, it fucked me up. I only had minor injuries, but I was mentally dead.\n\nFast forward to a month, I still was in shock, infact I still am.. I went to visit her family, to apologies, but couldn't even let out a word, just cried out loud, but somehow they understood my pain. Laura's dad seemed to be weaker, her mum always had a smile on but she looked so bad, she was in shock and it just made me feel worse and worse. A week later, I found out that Laura's dad had passed away, i wasn't ready for the funeral, I didn't go to laura's too because I couldn't accept it but my mum told me that I had to go to comfort her mum. But laura's mum had completely changed, she didn't want to hear anything from anyone because two of the most people in her life had passed away and I honestly could do nothing but cry looking at her.\n\nFast forward it to now, there hasn't been a day I felt that I could have done better, I could have reacted better, and if i had turned the other way, maybe I could have died instead of laura, maybe she survived she could have been with her dad for the rest of time, maybe seeing her daughter would have kept him alive for a bit longer, maybe the mum would have been brave having her daughter around. I know it's not my fault, i've heard people say that constantly, it's not fault bro\" but I could have done better, to prevent it, and that is stuck in my mind, and always will. I honestly have no hope for life, I just want to die, i can't get over these thoughts, I just hope I die real soon.... It's not that I want sympathy but I just can't deal with it, it hurts.",

I want to be a normal teenage girl. So, I desperately tried it in hopes it would unlock my ability to feel sexual desire and attraction. I didn't get too far in, being very, VERY hesitant, when my Mom barged in my room to check if I was asleep. I hear her yell \"WHAT WERE \\*YOU\\* DOING?\", her loud reaction caused my little sister to rush in and also see me, and I'll save the other details.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe talked after that, and I told her my story of how I was only trying it because I was scared I couldn't feel any sexual feelings, I wish I had've come out as Ace to her right there and then, but I was worried she'd think it was fake.

It embarrassed me so much, my little sister won't look me in the eyes anymore, and I've felt like utter shit around my mother.

    "selftext": "Last night I was coming home from a night out with friends and was very intoxicated. While I was walking, a man approached me. He was smiling weirdly and acting very strange, so I told him to stay away from me. No one else was around. \n\nHe then lunged at me and forced his hand down my pants and underwear, grabbing me down there. It hurt. He held my arms behind my back so I couldn’t try to stop him. I started screaming and telling him to stop, and trying to run away from his grasp. I remembered I had pepper spray, but I couldn’t reach it in my bag since he was holding my arms back. By some miracle, a few people appeared off in the distance and so eventually he saw them approaching and he let me go.\n\nI sprinted ran the rest of the way home.  I was horrified, disgusted, disturbed, scared, and in my drunken state all I wanted to do was kill myself. I tried cutting my arms with a kitchen knife, but it wasn’t sharp enough. I sat in the shower for hours crying and screaming, wishing I would die in my sleep that night. \n\nToday, I told my friends and family what happened. I’m no longer an immediate risk for suicide in this moment, but I am still spiraling. I am so disturbed and disgusted and don’t know how to live with myself after this horrible act was done to me.\n\nPlease any advice on what to do or how to cope and heal would be very helpful. I’m already in therapy so of course I will do that but could really use some support and encouragement. ",

    "selftext": "I'm probably going to sound like a terrible ungrateful person for saying this but, I just don't want to deal with anything anymore. My family is okay, had some arguing here and there but nothing abusive. I'm currently in uni with decent grades but also a whole lot of stress.\n\nI've had suicidal thoughts for at least 8 years now, most of the times they come and go, but recently I've been starting to feel like things are pointless. I don't want to end up in a low paying job in this broken economy, doing the same thing from day till night, rinse and repeat. I hate having to deal with expectations of people and myself. I hate feeling like a fucking failure who can't get a job because of volatile emotions. I hate dealing with people who expect everything but pay you sheckels.\n\nI don't see the point of carrying on anymore. Sure, there will be good times, but even during the good times I can't feel anything anymore. All I can feel is just neutral or depressed, and all I can do is pretend to be alright, all smiles, maybe play a fucking idiot to put on the act that all is well and I'm an upbeat cheerful person, or I'll just get into more trouble and even more depression. I feel like nobody I talk to will understand, and the people I've talked to all just say \"I've been through worse and I'm fine\", and I'm sick and tired of hearing that.\n\nI don't know what to do anymore. I just want to fall into a coma, but that won't happen anytime soon. Sometimes I just wish my brain wasn't this volatile and would take a chill pill, but a therapist is out of the option since they're very expensive and because of the whole covid situation.\n\nI don't want to be a burden to anyone anymore. But I don't know what to do.\n\nI don't know. Thank you for reading though. Deep down I still wish that everything will be okay, even though I hate holding on to false hope.\n\nEdit: It feels surreal to wake up and see that people have responded to this.

    "selftext": "**trigger warning - talk of sexual and physical abuse.There is no TL DR, I need to vent. I've never told anyone the entirety of my life. I never wrote down how I felt. I want to see if it helps.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was physically abused by my father. I remember one time he slammed/pushed the kitchen table into my chest while I was eating dinner. It pressed my chair up against the wall, then pushed all the air out of my chest. I remember getting tunnel vision and hitting the floor limp, as the table was pulled away.\n\nWhen I tried to get up, while on hands and knees, I was kicked in my stomach by him. I don't remember anything other than being on the couch and my mom leaving him after that with me and my 2 brothers. I was 8. This is ONE story.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy great grandfather used to call me worthless and emotionally abuse me because of my ethnicity. Until I was in my 20's I was reminded daily about how worthless I was over something I had no control over. He basically stepped in as the father figure. I would spend my summers in Southern California helping him super his apartments until I was about 17.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have never told anyone this, I was also sexual abused.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have never told anyone this, I was raped.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo me, those are two separate things. When the abuse started, I physically enjoyed it. Had no idea. Then I was brutally sodomized. Then I grew up just a little and that's when I started to hate distrust and not like anyone. I built a fake smile. I built an auto pilot response for everyday things. I don't think. When I can, I do what I can to stop.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFrom the ages of 9, to about 14 I was fucking raped weekly by a boy 7 years older(We'll call the fat ugly rapist FMC). I felt like shit because at the start I liked it. I didn't know what was happening to me, I just felt. By the time I was 12, I started to feel disgusted. By 14, I fucking hated everyone. I don't care to discuss the last time he abused me but I will say I don't think he EVER put himself in the position he was in. He left me alone at that point.\n\nBy the time I was 18, I was wrapping up making money by taking it from adults to beat the shit out of under age people I went to school with (gang related and they didn't want to get in trouble, and hell whats the worst that could happen to me if I get caught? I was a minor), they all deserved \\*this is just how I felt at the time\\* it and it was my only outlet. It was shit like, kids stealing and the owners wanting revenge cause a family member seen them with the stolen property at school. Or someones dad wanted me to scare the shit out of the daughters boyfriend. Shit like like that. The last time I did something like this for example - Some kid who was a senior ( over 18 at the time )had his stereo stolen. He gave me $50 to beat the shit out of the kid who did it ( 16yo ). He reminded me of the boy who raped me. When I punched that kid, all I could see was that fat piece of shit FMC. When he was on the ground, in the fencing position, I drug and slammed him around by is hair. Into the side walk. I picked him off the ground, while he was dead weight- and rubbed his head in the top of a chain link fence. I was expelled and arrested for assault. I tested out of High school. I have never ever been violent with ANYONE since then. All the way till now and I'm 36.\n\nDuring my time in School, seventh through high school, I hated everyone. Fuck em. I had only 1 real friend and I had one crush on a girl. One. It lasted no less than 2 weeks of fantasizing before FMC learned about it. He didn't like it. He told David my best friend at the time (he had no idea FMC was fucking raping me and new him as a friend of my family) that I had made out with her. He knew David liked her. David, pissed from hearing this, asked Christian. Of course she denied it. It never happened, it wasn't true. I was now known as a Liar. She went to church and school with me. I was 13 at the time, so from grade school right on through to high school, if I went to church with you or school, I was a liar. So the one girl I've ever liked now labeled me and to everyone else a liar. My best friend, no longer, because now I'm a liar. This was what happened the first time I ever told another person I had FEELINGS twards someone else. One little bitty crush. Now - No social life. Destroyed. Home life also. Behind the scenes is a literal fucking hell. I liked girls. was being raped by a 300lb+ fat fucking boy. I hated FMC, after my last altercation with him I was close to or at 15. About a year goes by. No girls look at me. Small town. I don't like them, because they hate me, I lie about making out with em. I wanted to have sex though. To be clear, I wanted to fuck. I had been fucked. I wanted to have joy... Just once... So I had a plan. When I was around 16, doing the summer Super Job for my Grandfather, I paid a prostitute for my first sexual encounter that mattered because I wanted to know what sex was like with a woman. When I got back to Northern California after the summer job at gramps, I told my older brother and he called me a liar. I never told him anything personal up until recently because of that. now my family thinks I'm a liar, and hates me to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo at this point I am 18 and I fucking hate everyone. My dad also starts developing a mental disorder. He slowly is becoming mentally disabled. I figured, fuck him. Some karma.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI decide to move out. My cousin, she moves in with me. I was growing weed at the time. Played video games. Didn't think.\n\nShe and I connected. She was the first person I ever felt ANY affection for. She didn't want to use me. She didn't want hurt me. She wanted to know why I was hurt. My head at this point of my life is just so fucked I think/confuse that with her romantically liking me. I did my best to sleep with her. She out of guilt, w/e let me. She knew nothing about my past for the most part and we did not grow up together.\n\nI knew her from the age of 1-5, then met her again when she was 17. I, out of the fucked up need to want to be wanted by the ONLY person I actually had confused feelings for manipulated or talked or w/e my cousin into an incestuous relationship. I wanted to kill myself. I kicked her out of the apt. She moved in with my older brother and had a sexual relationship with him for about 3 years. I felt I was the one that fucked her in the head enough to do that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was going to kill myself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy grandmother, the great grandfathers daughter had bad arthritis. She was a chef. So I learned to cook and take care of her. I learned that I enjoyed people eating and liking my cooking. This was the first time I felt ANY joy from someone else. People. My grandmother died when I was around 26. she killed her self, the pain was to much. I hate saying this but, I didn't really care. I love her... but I didn't care. At least she wasn't in pain....\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI felt nothing for anyone for a good period of time. No love, no hate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo until about the age of 27, I got hit on multiple times. I am not unattractive I guess. I was in 8 physical relationships in my twenties. 2 I sorta developed feelings for. I never asked any of them out. I never once told them I loved them. I never lied to them or cheated. They asked me out, they persude me.  Sex was a chore. I love sex in my head. I love to  masturbate . Watch a healthy amount of porn. But actually having sex..... ugh, I would rather  masturbate  tbh. Everything sex reminded me of two things, the only person I care for and still love like a sister now, my cousin; which makes me sick to my stomach because I felt I manipulated her into doing something horrible, and being raped in the ass by a big fat piece of shit.\n\nWith porn at least I can choose any nice loving thing that I want. I like scenes where you can tell there really into each other...  And I don't have to think.\n\n\\`\n\nAt 28 I was in love for the first time.  Met her at work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe started everything. I mean EVERYTHING. She broke up with her boyfriend AT work. Asked me out in front of him the next week. For 6 months she was in a relationship with me, for 6 months I thought we were together. For 6 months her and her old boyfriend who she was in a relationship with for more than 5 years at this point, used me to further his cuckold fantasy. When I found him literally in the closet one night in MY FUCKING APARTMENT that she snuck him into that day at what time I DON'T FUCKING KNOW, jacking off to me fucking his girlfriend who I thought was with me, I flipped out. My life is insane, WTF IS THIS SHIT. Melony thought I was going to kill them. I might've. She left, both naked, with my blanket, peeling out of the parking lot. I quit that job the next day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI want to kill myself. Have it planned.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy father develops a bad health issue, compounded with his now mental age of around 7, his health his slipping. fast.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI move in with him, the state pays for me to take care of him. I do nothing but play video games and smoke weed. I'm waiting. I tell myself, \"When he dies. I go to.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt 31, I leave the house maybe once a month. My older brother decides he wants to reach out cause I'm a \"little\" closed off. At the age of 32 He includes me in his hobby. At 34, I turned it into what might now be a carrier. I still take care of my father. I am not so sad anymore.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm 36, I'm doing well at the job I can make into a career. I met someone. Another Co worker. And for the first time, no confusion, I have a full blown crush as an adult. She's nothing special to look at. Not ugly in any way. But my god the personality, her choice in music, so many things in common. Thinking about her makes me smile. She initiated the flirting. We chatted for hours and hours for weeks. This did not happen over night. She has been there for 7 months at this point, and about 2 attached at my hip when she had free time. Also the subjects she would bring up. She was very much flirting. So of course I tell her. No way can I have any regrets.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo today I come into work and she makes no eye contact and shuts her office door. Witch is not normal. I ask her if I can talk to her about something later at lunch. We get ice cream some times together so I figured that would be the time. She just avoided and left me standing there after I asked if we could talk later. Didn't answer. So I asked her at the end of the day. Told her how I felt, and the last thing that I wanted was for her to feel weird at work.  Then she told me she has some one, and it's \"complicated\". I am almost positive, she likes another coworker. I see them text each other all the time. Didn't think anything of it till today. The thing is, yesterday I mentioned I might ask her out the next day joking around when I seen the other co worker in the parking lot, the one I think she likes. He doesn't work in the building with us. Hadn't seen or talked to him at all today. He Laughed when he seen me today at the end of the day when we clocked out. Pretty sure he told her the day before, it made so much sense after I thought about it. The way she avoided me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe wants nothing to do with me. Went from conversations, her staring at me when she thought I wasn't looking, to her actively avoiding me at work. In just one day. I went from feeling again. I went from finally feeling like I can open up to someone. I even entertained being normal once. I felt again for someone else ONCE MORE. This time it wasn't misplaced I told myself. I should have listened to myself when I told me not to even think like that. because it wont happen. It won't. Never in my life will I ever find someone that wants me for me, not to use me. Never in my life will I want the person that does. I will not be happy.\n\nAll I want for my coworker is to be happy. I don't think in any way that anything on both parts was malicious. I think it's just terrible timing. Or this is hell.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think I'm done. Thinking about headed to sleep.  I will check tomorrow to see what people have to say if anything... All I know is, I got to feel for once, and what I felt was what people do normally. I couldn't even once in my life have one thing ONE fucking thing normal. I can't be happy I guess. Fuck this world.\n\nUPDATE- I made it home from work. While I was at work I felt comfortable enough to talk a LITTLE to a co - worker. Gave him a little perspective and the day was less award than I thought it would be. he helped just by listening. That being said, she still locked herself in her office all day so there was at least not to much awkwardness. Didn't have lunch with everyone witch is very unusual for me and left a little early so we didn't have to leave together. I just want her to feel comfortable at work. It's not her fault at all. Also everyone at work knows. Everyone including both my bosses thought the same as I did about my co-workers interest in me. One even asked the girl I liked I guess, \"how long do you think it will take before you two hook up?\". So I guess my mind wasn't playing tricks on me. Just wish she didn't play games. All I know is I can't choose how I feel and I bet she's no different. So I am just going to be myself for right now. Do what I do. Don't think, just do. But fuck, I'm still so fucking tired of being nothing, feeling nothing. At least today I felt like shit =) I mean, that at least is something...  \n\n\nAnother thing I will add is my older brother and I have different fathers and my cousin is not a blood relative of his.

I believe that people who love their jobs or their dream has always been to work as X job are brainwashed people. Jobs nowadays demand too much hours of labor and pay the bare minimum to survive/not even that, so isn't that slavery? \n\nI'm a young adult not processing the fact that I'm spending the little time in earth that I have working like a slave while rich people have perfect lives due to being born rich, nepotism or luck. \n\nI know I will get burnout but why are not people burnout enough to actually go against this system? Humans are not meant to work so much, there are people that are not working, why can't hours be shared with this people so that we all worked less? And you'll tell me something like well companies can't pay so many workers but if those workers (that previously weren't working nor making money) had money then they could buy more from these companies and so on, idk, maybe this is stupid thinking, idk anything about economy.\n\nAs I was saying I do not believe that humans are meant for this nor work the same job for 50 years, I cannot believe that this is the only system that works, I know that there must be another one. My dream is that in the future people look back and see this era as hell bc everything will have progressed so much that they can't fanthom living our horrible lives.\n\nI was looking for other ways to make money but in this generation it looks like you have to make a clown out of yourself on social media or be super talented which I'm not compared to the incredible people that has filled all the niches, there aren't any gaps left for me.\n\nTherefore, I will have to die. I don't want to stain my good childhood and teenage years with slavery. Life has been good, it only goes downhill from here. I tried to talk about this with other people but they are too far gone into the system, they have been brainwashed and truly believe they will be happy in this system. I feel like I'm going crazy. In order to inmortalize my life as a good one and prevent suffering I will have to do it soon as I'm in my last year of university.\n\nA hug to y'all.\n",

    "selftext": "This is a throw-away but I intend on reading responses. I think I just mostly want to type and get things off my chest.\n\n(TLDR; Who can I talk to about my strong desire to kill myself without there being an fear of repercussions?  Every outlet I find wants to know my location or my contact info before they'll talk to me.  I just want to call a suicide hotline who won't trace my call.)\n\nI am 35 years old and live and work in Southern California as a Deputy for the last 10 years; I am no spring chicken.  My wife of 7 years and I have been struggling with infertility for 4 years now. lots of surgery and medication but no end in sight.  The stress of scheduled sex lives has absolutely taken a toll on us.  We're still very much in love, but its not the same.\n\nIn July of 2020 I had a fairly \"routine\" call involving child abuse that kind of pushed me over the edge. after the call I had a mental breakdown and I have been out of work since then.\n\nI take 45mg a day of Buspar (my wife says it doesn't help me... I am not sure), Xanax as needed as prescribed by my DO (I originally took....alprazam? but had a rare side effect and had to stop).  He has asked that I see a psychiatrist but the next avail appointment is mid-January. \n\nI digress...\n\nBecause of my line of work, if I talk about suicide it can be... well... career suicide (no pun intended).  So I keep all these thoughts absolutely bottled up inside and have to act like I am not having them when my therapists asks about it.  My therapist is provided by work and specializes in law enforcement issues, which is nice at times.\n\nI think about killing myself... hourly? I usually wake up 1-3 a night in the middle of a panic attack.  I cannot get away from this pain; its almost a physical pain. I have specific plans on how I would kill myself; the works.  I think about the entire process in detail often.  When I drink I usually come so close to actually doing it that I really fear its only a matter of time until it happens. Which is so ironic to type out.  Clearly I have reservations about killing myself when I am in the right state of mind... but when I am in the wrong state of mind it sounds like a realistic idea. I am physically exhausted from all of this I genuinely want the pain to end and I not seeing any answers on how to make it happen.\n\nI want to talk to someone about this WITHOUT putting my job on the line (being put on a 5150 hold in CA means I cannot carry a gun and therefore... yeah...).  I am so heartbroken and frustrated I just don't know what to do anymore.  Every day seems like groundhog day.  I desperately want my wife to leave me because she deserves better; it would make it a lot easier to end my life if she hated me.  I have completely gotten rid of social media and blocked my parents out of my life for no really good reason.  What a downward spiral the last few months has been.\n\nWho can I talk to about my strong desire to kill myself without there being an fear of repercussions?  Every outlet I find wants to know my location or my contact info before they'll talk to me.  I just want to call a suicide hotline who won't trace my call.  I really think I will end up killing myself within the next few months, but ironically I don't want to talk to anyone who might be able to stop me. This is so backwards.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust typing this out if very exhausting and I might go to bed for the night.  Thank you for listening.",

    "selftext": "Around 7 months ago, I found websites and forums that promised penis size increase and attempted to do these techniques and failed horribly. I have lost so much sensitivity for no reason. Everywhere on my penis has arounf 10% sensitivity left and my scrotum's sensitivity is almost all gone aswell. Morning wood is super soft, erections are super soft. I'm only 19 and damaged my penis for life. I'm heading to the doctors next friday, but read all on the internet that nerve damage is permanent. In the last 7 months there have been zero improvement in my penis. I can't sleep anymore and can't tell anyone in my life because this is so embarrassing. I've dropped all my college classes except one and failed that class. This has taken a mental toll in my life and I don't think I can continue any longer. The first time I went to the doctors, they just gave me cialis, if they do it again I think I'm done with life. I can't continue life like this, every time I pee, take a shower, wake up with a weak erection, every time I walk I get reminded with the lack of sensations from my groin, I get reminded that I fucked everything up due to my insecurities. I have shut myself off from the world in the last 7 months. I just stay in bed all day or watch this livestreamer xqc which helps me forget until he ends stream.  I went dead silent in my friend's groupchat ever since this happened, I can't just pop in like I have havent been gone for little over half a year.\n\nI know some will say \"you're an idiot for doing this\" and you are correct. I wasn't even small, I'm 6 in long with 4.3 in girth . But how can I feel good about my size when I was hit all my life with that I have a small penis stereotype because I am an asian american. The first time I was hit with that stereotype was in 5th grade I remember that girl that said I didn't have a penis because i was asian. That terrified 9 or 10 year old me. Yeah and of course i get hit that stereotype in middle school as well with more stuff like I eat dog and what not. Flash forward to highschool, I'm in the football locker room with my teammates, went to take a piss at the urinals, my douche of a teammate stares at my dick while pissing says I have a pencil dick and tells my other teammates and make more racist jokes. Now flash forward to college during the corona virus shit. Asians getting blamed and shit, I was filling up my gas and this dude yells at me \"these small dicked asians ruin everything\". I can't say shit except \"shut the fuck up bitch\". Later stumbled upon penis enlargement exercises and gave myself nerve damage. Your penis is fine they way it is, if it gets hard thats all you need. You shouldn't be turned down by a life partner over your penis size. I've dated 3 girls and none of them complained. I should have felt satisfied from that. If a girl denies you for your size, you dodged a massive bullet, a missile maybe.\n\nIf you are self concious about your size, please do not do what I did it's not worth it at all.",

    "selftext": "I (20F) have been with my boyfriend (21M) for 2.5 years, and he has made it clear he wants kids from the beginning. I’m diagnosed with autism and was always pretty firm on not wanting kids, but he made me feel like we would be able to handle it together if we had kids, so slowly over time I came around to the idea.\n\nA year and a half ago, I got pregnant but we were in a bad financial position, so I had an abortion early on. It was a mutual agreement, and I moved past it pretty easily, but he was really torn up about it. I told him when we’re able to bring a kid into the world, we would go through with it.\n\nSince then I’m making a lot more money and he also has a job now. Back in January of this year, I found out I’m pregnant, and expected to deliver at the end of August. He was very excited and told me he wanted me to keep it, and although for the longest time I didn’t want kids, I genuinely saw a future with this man and thought having a kid together was a beautiful thing.\n\nSometime in the last two months, he has gone from being excited about the baby— sharing ultrasound pictures, wanting to make sure I’m drinking enough water and eating enough for me and the baby— to not wanting this kid at all. He told me he realized he’s not ready for kids, and he’s not willing to “throw his whole life away” for one kid. He realized he doesn’t want to give up his own personal freedom and playing video games all day/not having any major responsibilities. Don’t get me wrong, those are all reasons I didn’t want to have kids in the first place and I communicated that to him, but back in January, he talked me into changing my mind because I thought “I love this man, we can actually support this child now, and my love is so strong that I want to start a family”.\n\nNow he’s giving me my options. We’re saving up for our own place, and my parents have money, so they let us stay at their house and we have our own bedroom and living room. They are EXTREMELY excited and supportive about a grandchild. I’m so grateful for them. But my bf says either he’s leaving once the baby is here and I have to be a single mom, we have to give the baby up for adoption and get kicked out by my parents, or to stage an accident to cause a late miscarriage and say it was a mistake. I’m pro choice but I’m 28 weeks pregnant, and he(the baby) moves around a lot, this is a real baby, nothing like the abortion I had at 6 weeks. I’m not a monster.\n\nBut I only changed my mind about kids because I thought we were going to do this together, he wanted it so bad. Now he’s completely flipped and talks about how unwanted this baby is for him and how he should have never convinced me to keep the pregnancy. I thought maybe he was just scared and he wasn’t good at showing it, but he’s made it clear he wants nothing to do with raising a child. Without a partner to co parent with, I would have never wanted this kid. I don’t want this kid to grow up with a regretful single mom or a dad who doesn’t want him.\n\nMy boyfriend says he loves me and wants nothing bad to happen to me, but I can’t raise a kid by myself. I don’t think I’m high functioning enough to do it without the other parent, but everyone tells me I’ll be an amazing mother. But my baby deserves so much better than me. No one is going to want to date and marry an autistic single mom who’ll never be able to drive. I thought I was super lucky with my boyfriend, and now I feel so blindsided.\n\nOnce my baby is born, I’m going to kill myself. My boyfriend can find someone to move in with, he’d have to anyway if he’s going to leave once the baby is here anyway. I’m saving up money and buying lots of baby items so it isn’t as big of a financial burden to my parents. My parents are amazing people and tell me I can live at home with the baby as long as I would like, so I feel comfort knowing they’ll have my baby to remember me by, and my son will have such a loving household.\n\nI can’t tell anyone this, so I came here to get this off my chest. I’m going to cherish the last two months I have with my boyfriend and my family. I never wanted to be a single mom, and I can’t bare to think about seeing my baby every day and him looking like my boyfriend, thinking how he’s gone back on his word hurts so bad. I would’ve just had another abortion and looked into better birth control if he had realized he didn’t want kids back then. We could have been a happy childfree couple. I hope when my son is older, he’ll understand. ",

I really liked the series and still do but after some episodes I just, put my tablet I was watching it on down and laid in my bed, feeling numb.\n\nthen I took a shit ton of painkillers. I had tried killing myself maybe even hundreds of times before so I didn't care if it failed but I wished I could finally die.\nAs my legs started going numb and shaking a bit, I wanted to say goodbye to my friends im our discord group and they got tired of my shit and called me an ambulance, which arrived soon and took me to the nearest hospital which was about 1,5hours away.\n\nin there, some doctor came to ask me about my suicidal intentions and after that my parents came crying to the room and I couldn't even look at them knowing they were so dissapointed in me. my dad was home and mom was at work while the ambulance arrived.\n\nwhen the ambulance arrived, by the way, they made me drink a huge bottle of carbon mixed with water, apparentaly to stop the painkillers from spreading any further into my body.\n\nafter a long evening in the hospital, they just sent me straight to a psych ward. I was in there for a month (while in suicide watch, I think).\n\nmy time in the psych ward was okay, I got friends and I met my current girlfriend in there, but my family never acts the same around me anymore.

I rarely even get any private space anymore. In school people look at me disgusted, probably because rumours about my suicide accempt have been spreading around. i skip almost all of my classes, sometimes I just sit im the schools restroom floor, staring down or go to the library to read books about suicide and death.\n\nneedless to say, my grades are dropping really fast.

    "selftext": "I quit. \n\nI can’t do this anymore. The world has gone to shit. My life is a mess. I can’t keep going anymore. \n\nI have no career prospects. No skills. No savings. No real home. No hobbies. No friends. There’s nothing to do and nothing to live for anymore in my life. Nothing to plan or to hope for. I’m not going anywhere and I’m sick of pretending that one day, somehow my hard work will pay off, because it never does and it never will. Fuck it all. \n\nMy partner is a fucking nightmare to be with and is totally self absorbed and unsupportive. And swings wildly between a neurotic stoner who looses it like a skittish racehorse incapable of negating basic daily life or totally callous and cold and removed. No in between. She completely sabotages EVERYTHING I try to do for myself because she’s to fucking lazy and content with living like shit to make a change in her own life and ruins any resemblance of order I try to make for myself. \n\nI hate my shitty life. I hate the cunts I have to sit on the phone and “play nice with” selling shit they don’t need all day while being screamed at day in day out for less than minimum wage. I am rejected from every “good” job filtered and processed by AI I and pretend I want just so I can have a basic rate of pay that is financially viable enough to live off or god forbid, save. I looked at my CV the other day and I might as well have said, “fuck me up the arse for money” and I would have had better offers. At least then I wouldn’t feel so bad when inevitable some faceless corporation comes to emotionally, physically and financially fist fuck me in the name of profit margins and wildly conflicting agendas. At least I wouldn’t be so fucking surprised.\n\nEveryday of my life is just one big joke. I put one foot forward and it’s just straight into the next biggest pile of dog shit. Constantly wading through piles of the next worst day of my life to the next. Pretending like one day it will be better but one day never comes.\n\nI’m ugly, I’m fat and unemployable and scratch a bare minimum of making do throughout it all. Everything I love fucks up in the end and I hate where it’s gotten me. The vapid swirling vortex of fuck all. The purgatory of wearing this fucking mask, pushing boulders, breaking my back, tearing my nerves to shreds by the handful. Grating my bones to brittle twigs for some fat lazy cunt to get rich off of who doesn’t even know I’m alive. \n\nThen there’s the fucking world going to fuckkery... Honestly tell me what the point would even be anymore if I carried on and if by some miracle should somehow be falling out of my ass, why bother? Pretty much everyone is dying of this fucking virus or moronically trying to spread it further with their woowoo fucking cunt faced conspiracy shit or out of sheer ignorance desperate to give one another a death sentence via coughing fit. Even if that should somehow be solved within the next 6-8 months, the worlds still fucked and passed the point of no return, waiting for the seas to boil the life out of them, the ice caps to melt, the animals to rot from inside out and the world to goatse itself into a complete inhospitable prolapsed wasteland or, at best to wander around crippled by its change and ravage with mask and life support donned, picking our way through the mess for scraps.\n\nFuck me, even if the world doesn’t fuck us up, the socio-economic buggery will be the equivalent of throwing a brick into the middle of a crowded bar fight. Police and totalitarianism on the horizon, double speak, riots, food shortages, poverty, fake news, social unrest, the slump of everyday life as we know it cracking its skull on the wall behind and dribbling from its mouth as it sinks to its fucking knees.\n\nI don’t even feel good about having kids anymore... What’s the point? Their lives will probably be worse off than my own. Maybe they too will bemoan and rue my “millennial” generation for their selfish, narsasstic, self-titled “irony”. Maybe they’ll find it in their hearts to forgive a generation of people who’s entire golden existence gave them the gift of the word “selfie” and social media that harvests their data for shady governments. Maybe they can overlook the fact that I cant afford to send them to school or home them in a house and feed them because I simply can’t make enough. \n\nWhat will I tell them when the end finally comes and they ask me “What did you do to stop all of this?”... What will I say, “oh yes darling I know we now live in a filthy pile of rags under a bin in a environmental nightmare but we had banksy make up a load of pithy little tee shirts to raise awareness and subtly undermine the futility of the modern world. Isn’t that great?!” And then we can all die from a poison gas cloud melting our lungs into grape jelly.\n\nSo what’s the point? \n\nHonestly? Can anyone give me a fucking reason because at this point, I KNOW it doesn’t get better or easier. I KNOW that my life will just be one lurch of shit to another. I KNOW that none of this can get any better for me, I’m ready to quit. \n\nI have some beta blockers and a beer, I don’t want to sit around and wait anymore. \n\nI can’t do this. I can’t hold on. I can’t make it better. It just doesn’t go that way for me and I hate it. I don’t want to suffer anymore and be stuck poor and making do anymore. I can’t. Everyday I am stuck inside and just waiting for the courage to not be a pussy and eat all the meds I have. Who knows I’ll probably fuck that up in the end too.\n\n\nEdit/Update: \n\nHello dear gentle people who heard me and gave me such kindness when I was so low and lost. \n\nI am alive and yesterday morning I woke up, quit my shitty job and with the day finally to myself, I did something that I didn’t actually ever consider I would do being dyslexic and generally very pessimistic... I wrote a short story. \n\nNow it’s probably just all purple prose and rambling and dog shit but I was so moved and inspired by all of your sweet remarks of my rants that for once in my miserable little life I believed in me. I finished something, I saw fit to try for once. \n\nMy partner is still an absolute cunt and so completely far up her own arse she might be wearing herself as a hat. I believe now this is probably because of her addictions or her god awful personality that metronomes quickly from toxic, incompetent and dumb to victim mindset mired in lack  of the cursed sickness “melodram-pathetism” and not ever changing. \n\nFor the moment I’m still with her. She’s still emotionally distant and completely unself aware. I will see where this goes but I don’t have a huge amount of hope for her. I have a separate bank account so might indeed save up to get my own place away from everyone including her, even as a temporary measure. I am acutely aware of how little time I have really had all to myself and how little control I have in my life and it has become very clear, almost painfully so, that if she doesn’t care for me then I think she shall not fight for me. \n\nUntil that point. I want to write. I feel like I need to live for something and that my writing can help. If anyone has and tips or pointers for assistance for where and how I can share my work I would be eternally grateful. \n\nThank you all for helping me, and to all of those who reached out to me and found themselves in the same curled, gnarled words I put up here; I am only too sorry that there should be others that have to feel in that same way. Which is probably much more saddening than my rant in itself really, that so many more like me feel that way. I’m sorry you have also felt like this. I wish you all the very best and thank you again for your warmth and love. \n\nTake care.",

Thank you everyone for reaching out and making me feel less alone. I’m overwhelmed by all the positive responses. I guess not all people are malicious after all. Keep spreading the love ❤️\n\nDepression made me dumb, uninteresting, made me stop reading books, made me stop learning, caused me to spend days like a zombie, caused me amnesia, literally caused my brain to shrink. But the worst was the effect it had after 15 years of fucking my brain. Now I lost my mind. Now i lost that quirky weird fun personality. Now i have lost the cultured nerd that i used to be. I had to grow up getting bullied for being a nerd, for being weird, for not poisoning my mind with mindless activities and TV.\n\nThen I grew up and I lost all of those qualities that were supposed to make me have a cool life and cool friends finally. I wanted to be in the art community, going to talks and book readings and exhibitions and come back from it open a bottle of wine and drink it around the aged wooden table which stands in the middle of the living room that is surrounded by weird and classic paintings, contemporary sculptures and talk about philosophy. I was supposed to be the cultured smart weird but interesting guy. I WAS THAT GUY. I was born to be that guy.\n\nBut depression fucked me. And for the past 5 years I had set the goal to become that person again. The real me. But i have not only failed but I have rotten even further. Depression is a disease and has to be dealt with early on, otherwise there's no point in living like a half vegetable, high on antidepressants during the day and sleeping while on benzos at night.\n\nI lost 2 women I truly loved due to my depression. Due to them thinking that I was that cultured smart creative and deep thinker, only to find out I had nothing to talk about, I wasn't able to form arguments, wasn't able to debate on topics, hadn't read many books, didn't know anything about art or culture and was simply boring and dumb to them. It's my worst nightmare come true. People ditching and telling me I'm uninteresting. This was NOT SUPPOSED TO BE my life. I deserved to be loved and experience that love with her after years of patience, years of pain and sorrow. I persevered. I don't accept this anymore. I tried to change but it doesn't work. I can't read anymore. My brain is fucked and I've literally lost so many IQ points that i don't understand what people tell me. My brain is too slow. And while reading i forget the sentences i read after a couple of seconds so I can't connect them and comprehend the story. I live in the moment. I can only hold 5 seconds of life in my mind. I lost my creativity. My ability to imagine and see while my eyes are closed.\n\nOh my god we would have been so perfect for each other. She is my female version. I am her. And she is exactly the person I wanted to be. Maybe that's why I love her so much. And as mad and hurt as I am for the way she treated me, I really can't blame her for not wanting me. I wouldn't want this \"me\" either. But it hurts so much because i know how i used to be. I know how my life would have turned out without the depression. Its so fucking painful. A family member killed himself a couple of years ago and that was less painful. It was shocking but this daily constant pain, this living through my nightmares is unbearable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have become a stupid dumb ass uncultured loser and i deserve to die. I deserve my peace. This is not me. You can have my life. I don't want it anymore. I am in hell and I want this to end.",

I am now the stereotypical loser living with their parents. No job. No life. No happiness.\n\nThe crazy thing about suicide is that rarely does it come out of the blue.   It's a buildup of a lot of stuff.  \nI wouldn't say all of this is my fault. The job market and economy is crap. I could work minimum wage again, but honestly when you have nothing to look forward to this is what happens.  America has gotten rough.\n\nTake this story as a cautionary tale. Get help when you are younger. The older you get, the harder it is to change your thought patterns. Depression and Anxiety got to me, and have won. 30 years ago they didnt have the treatment and awareness they have now.  There is hope for you younger adults.\n\nToo late for me. I screwed up too many times. While my classmates got married and rose up the ladder, I kept pace until 6 months ago.  Life throws curveballs like this, but it knocked me down and frankly nobody cares. I got left in the dust by my friends. My parents pity me while my siblings have great lives. The worse part about being suicidal is people filling you with false hope so you will shut up and leave them alone.\n\nI had some good times, some bad times, and sad times in life. But depression and anxiety won the war while I won some battles. I did the best I could.\n\nI hope that this can help someone so they dont end up like me.  Work hard, listen to your peers, dont burn bridges. Get therapy and medication right away if yoh are struggling.  Don't end up like me. Dying is tragic but having a really pathetic life before dying is even worse.\n\nMay others find happiness that I could not on this Earth.  \n\nXxxxxx",

    "selftext": "I feel like I am completely losing my mind now. I have been dealing with so much resurfacing childhood trauma lately and I am dissociating heavily. Last night I went to bed praying for God to kill me in my sleep, and the thought of it actually happening made me feel so calm and content. I woke up multiple times during the night in complete panic and everytime I woke up I just started praying for God to kill me when I fall asleep again. \n\nI almost did it myself a few months ago, but I was able to resist the urge and stick around a little longer. I planned everything and I still have that exact same plan in my mind. I have the equipment and I can do it whenever, but I seriously am trying to fight the urge. It's tough. \n\nI felt better in the morning but during the day I have started to dissociate more and more, and right now as I am writing this, I have no clue what the fuck is even going on. I don't even know if what I'm writing makes sense, but I am trying my hardest. All I can think of right now is death. The thought of taking my own life gets me full of excitement and makes me feel almost complete euphoria. I held the rope in my hand today and just couldn't stop smiling. I tried tying the rope around my neck and adding a little pressure, and I loved the feeling of not being able to breathe and my ears starting to ring. Not being able to think. I have a red mark around my neck from it. I have been suicidal since I was a kid ( my mom even told me that she once found a suicide note I wrote when I was 7-8 years old ) but I have never been this close to actually doing it. I have swallowed some pills in the past but nobody knows about it and I know that I really wasn't ready to die back then so I wasn't trying seriously. \n\nThe more the years pass, the more suicidal and unstable I become. Taking my own life doesn't feel like a fantasy anymore, it feels like a reality that is going to happen sooner or later. It doesn't even scare me in the slightest anymore, I have just come to accept it.",

I'm 28/f, and he was 30/m.\n\nHe was the most amazing person I had ever known, and he told me once last June about his plans to commit suicide. I tried to support him, but he killed himself months afterwards. I know that, as I was at the time, I couldn't be the reason he would want to live, but it hurts so much that he left me. He was the only one who would or could help.\n\nI called him crying very late one night, when he had a test the next day at 8 a.m., and he came over and spent the night with me and then took his test on two hours of sleep, and aced it because he was a genius. How am I ever going to find a guy like him again? I loved him, but I never told him, and he died all alone, feeling like he was unloved.\n\nI've cried every night since he died, wishing I could join him in death. I can't feel anything for anyone else. He made me feel beautiful and loved and cared for in a way I never thought was possible. Now he's gone...forever. I'm such a failure. I failed him. I never made him feel like he made me feel. He used to put his hand on my cheek, and tell me that I was the most beautiful and perfect girl in the world to him. Now, I pretend my pillow is his hand as I cry myself to sleep.\n\nI failed him. I was insecure and had intimacy issues, and I never told him how he was the most beautiful man in the world. He was everything. He had led such a hard and tragic life, but still he found the strength in himself to take care of everyone he cared for, including me. When I told him my father had sexually abused me, I expected him to run for the door. Instead, he held me and told me that he accepted me and loved me no matter what, and that I was still beautiful to him. I'm sobbing, remembering the unconditional love he gave me.\n\nI can't exist without him. I reach my arms out into the air sometimes when I'm trying to fall asleep, hoping I can feel his arms around me again. Why didn't I tell him that I loved him? Why did I assume I would see him again? I feel so guilty. I just want to feel his love again, and to smell him as he hugs me. He gave the best hugs in the world.\n\nI just want to die and be with him again. I want to tell him that I love him.\n\nShane...I love you. I'm so sorry you died alone, and that I wasn't there. I'm sorry you died feeling like no one loved you, because I do. If only I had shown you what was in my heart, maybe you would have stayed. I'm sorry. I love you with all of my heart. I know you wanted me to live, but I can't without you. You were the only one for me, but I was too stupid to let you in. I'll see you soon, my love, which is the first time I've called you that.\n\n- Cassie",

    "selftext": "I know exactly the day I’m going to do it. There are several reasons why I’ve chosen this date. First, my best friend of 12 years is getting married and I will be his best man in November. Second, I want to see my family for Christmas one last time. I’m going to drive myself somewhere relatively far and shoot myself in the head while in my car. I carry the suicide note I’ve already written in my wallet. I break down and cry every day. I think about dying almost every minute of the day. I do not sleep well, I won’t eat for days at a time. I’ve lost all motivation and hope for the future. I’m 24 years old and I have no desire to continue to live. I am only afraid that I will end my life before this date. I’ve spoken with suicide hotline several times this month. Only to keep myself alive until the end of December. I think about my plan everyday and it’s the only kind of mental relief I feel. I hope to die leaving my loved ones with good memories of me. It’s hard to fake being okay. I’m only staying alive for them. Unfortunately they are not enough to keep me going. I am certain I will end my life.\n\n\nEdit: First off i’d like to say thank you to everyone that has reached out to me privately and in the comments. I did not expect any of that. Also, I’ll share my story for those that have asked. \n\nWhen I was a child I was abused mentally and physically by my parents and grandmother. Despite the abuse I loved my parents and looked up to them, they divorced when i was 7 and I was completely devastated by the fact that my father was never going to come back home. The abuse did not stop however until I was in my early teens. In high school I was extremely depressed, had few friends and never a significant other. Never any aspirations for the future. When I graduated I went to live with my dad, that experience ended when we had physical altercation which resulted in him having a broken finger. He and I do not have a good relationship to this day. In the 7 years since, I have tired but have failed many times to get through college. Ive had many failed relationships that ended because I was always lied to and cheated on. Ive been addicted to various drugs over the years and I feel that my brain has turned to mush. Though now I only smoke weed and drink often. Recently I’ve gone through a break up that I feel has tipped me over the edge. We used to live together and we were happy for a while. For the first time in my life I felt that I had a purpose. I thought I could build a future with her, which is something I was never able to visualize with anyone else. For the first time in my life, I saw a future that wasn’t grim and full of failure. Unfortunately I could not meet her expectations and she ended the relationship. We’ve been sleeping together almost weekly and each time I feel that there’s a chance i can fix things. But she shoots me down each time. About a week ago she told me she’s taking a job that will require her to travel for 13 weeks at a time. She will be leaving in late August. Before I even got this news I was already planning on ending my life. I had my suicide note ready. I’ve been packing things away and trashing other things. So that my loved ones won’t have to. But now I’m afraid that when she leaves I will not have the strength to push through until December.",

They don’t -need- me.\n\nI tried to tell a friend recently how I’ve been feeling, and she told me that she needed me, her best friend, to live for her. Which is a lie. She has a loving fiancé and tons of other friends. She would be sad, but ultimately my death would mean nothing, even to her, after some time. She doesn’t need me.\n\nMy boyfriend, he might need me, but I don’t feel like I’m good for him. Not when I spend nearly every waking moment wishing for my own death. How can I support him when I can’t even support myself? He moved very far  away from home to be with me, but he is probably better off back home with his family, in an environment where he is actually comfortable. He might need me, but that doesn’t mean I’m good for him.\n\nI don’t want anyone to need me either. I want it to be okay to die after my mom passes.

Thank you for all you kind messages and comments, and please don’t hate yourselves if you tried to help me but couldn’t. I’m very useless when it comes to the help of others actually helping. I’m asking a girl I really like if she would just want to lay down in bed and hug, as I’ve really missed that human connection, but even if that does work out and we spend hours there hugging and talking, I’m still going to end it, because fuck the way my head works. Thank you guys. I haven’t said this to anyone but my names josh, idk why I feel like I should mention it but idk man. Good luck to you all, and hopefully I won’t be in pain for long. \n\nI will always miss you my love.\n\nEdit: I’ve been inundated with messages that I appreciate so so much. I’m still here surprisingly, I honestly thought I wouldn’t be by now. \n\nEdit 2: hey guys, thanks so much for everything you’ve all said to me or messaged me, I really appreciate every single one of you. I’m sorry I haven’t replied to some people, but I’ve read every comment and they’ve helped me so much. I’ve decided I’m going home tonight. I’m giving myself another two days, and if I feel ok, another two after that. I hope everyone here can ask her the lo and help each other. I love you all \n\nEdit 3: hi everyone, I want to thank you all so much for everything you guys said, it’s nice to know there are people out here that feel the same way, and I’m so awestruck by the help that you guys are also giving each other in the comments. The best description I could give right now is that my environment is still sharp, and everything I come into contact with hurts no matter the slightness of it. I’m still very very disregulated (not sure what the proper term is) and I’m finding it very hard to control the many impulses I do have. I haven’t been able to leave my room but I’ve still gotta go another day. I didn’t put it in my post but I suffer from bpd, so anyone else who is feeling like I am please read the comments. They are for you too, and anyone else who wants to take their own life. I might not end up making it much longer, but like I said I’m the previous edit, I’m going to give myself two days at a time, and if that doesn’t help just a day. If I don’t, please take this a pertinent reminder to reach out to absolutely anyone when you need help. Seek medical advice if you can’t protect yourself, and always be kind to others. Yeah you may have bad days, and you may hurt people that you care about, but those bad days don’t make you a bad person. I love you all so very much, and if I could take away the pain that you feel, I would in a heart beat. \n\nEdit 4: good luck everyone. I can’t do it. I hope all your lives are full of love and life. I really wish I was better but I’m better off dead. If my family ever see this I love you more than anything on this earth, and I wish things could have been different. I’m not going to rely or activists this account anymore as I don’t want to be stopped. Thank you to everyone for their kind words \n\nEdit 5: got taken to the hospital by police, family came and picked me up. I may get help soon but I don’t think it will be for a while. I’m going to keep the post up but I won’t respond to any comments. I’m sorry I can’t keep coming back and feeling the same. Thank you for all the help, I hope I can get past this. ",

Selfish to want it or engage when you sleep for 16 hours some days, don’t respond to meds and are very unstable. One day having made plans to end your life, the nest cancelling them. Being paralysed in bed another day. All those sorts of things make relationships unattainable and daunting for people like us.\n\nSo unfair and angering.

I feel we deserve it the most but we can’t feel it like other people because our mind is torturing us and convincing us we don’t deserve it.

    "selftext": "This is not going to be an easy post for anyone to read or for me to write. To establish things immediately, no I am not considering s\\*\\*cide or am I in immediate danger. I would never do that to my mom, the one person in this world who truly knows me and cares about me.\n\nWith that said, I think I'm just done with life. It's been building for awhile and it just keeps building. It doesn't have much to do with the Coronavirus or the Riots but those have been the final straws. The Coronavirus has taken away my ability to even attempt to make new friends, try new activities or even do things I enjoyed like traveling and playing tennis. Luckily workouts have resumed in my state so I can do that. The riots have taken away my love for sports and history. It seems like everything I love slowly but surely is being taken away from me by various forces.\n\nEven the activities I enjoy I don't enjoy as much as I used to. I feel like all they do is temporarily dull the mental and physical pain that I now feel constantly.\n\nThe Coronavirus has shown me just how hollow and empty my life has become. God is definitely not in my life and I am angry at him for various things (that I'll get into here in a minute). I am single and I have no kids or even pets to keep my company. While others at least had family to keep them company I've had no one. This Coronavirus pandemic has officially isolated me. Most of my family live in another state and I would be hesitant to travel for fear of getting them sick. Plus my nieces wouldn't see me anyway, they've bought into all the fear.\n\nI have failed so often at dating it's become comical. I decided to get back into dating with stuff opening up. I went on a date on Tuesday that I thought was going well. We played mini golf but then, according to her, her perfume started messing with her allergies. We didn't have any food or drinks after the round as she felt like she needed to go home. I contact her Thursday where she tells me that she's been seeing another guy for awhile and that they have decided to be official and she wants to see where it goes. Needless to say I sent a nice little message to her, nothing rude but telling her I thought it was pretty low to have gone on a date with me knowing I had no chance. Like so many other times in my dating life I just felt used.\n\nBesides being single with no kids or no pets I don't have a lot of friends. The few I do have know I struggle with depression at times and really do try to help. They all think I'm a very good guy who's just had bad luck and they truly believe I'm a good guy who deserves love and happiness. I just don't know if it's in my cards at this point.\n\nBesides that my body failed on me pretty early. I'm 35 but my body started failing on me around 30. Always had high blood pressure that was hereditary. Now I'm slightly overweight, have hemorrhoids occasionally and also suffer from allergies and eosinophilic asthma. I was on a flight to Nashville back in 2017 (2 hour flight) where my throat really dried out. I started to panic which then caused my asthma to flare up. No medical emergency but it was a horrible flight. Now my doctor has me take a Xanax 0.25mg tablet before the flight to relax and a Prednisone 50mg tablet to control the Asthma. It's worked but whereas I used to love flying I now dread it. I feel like it's destroyed my ability to travel, I don't want to fly for longer than a few hours. But there's so many places I've wanted to see. I've asked my doctor about it and I've asked a Pulmonologist about it but they don't seem to take it seriously. I think they think it's all mental for me at this point. Ever since I became afraid to fly it's destroyed me a piece at a time.\n\nSo besides my body betraying me my mind has betrayed me as well. I know I've suffered from some Anxiety like I mentioned but even my therapist won't officially diagnose me with Depression. My mind is always half empty and I think my physical conditions have caused my mind to deteriorate.\n\nAll in all part of me truly wants to believe in reincarnation. That we get multiple chances at this life and that I'll just get another chance. I know Christian religions don't believe in reincarnation but it's one of the few things that gives me hope. I will say this, I think God made a mistake having me be born during this time. I believe I was born in the wrong time.\n\nI have a job that's a good job but it's ultimately a dead end job. I've never been one who had that light click on in terms of a passion. I've always been adrift in terms of what I want to do. Yes I have a Bachelor's Degree with a double major in Management and Marketing. I also have my SHRM Certification as a Certified HR Professional. But if I'm honest I don't have a passion for any of it.\n\nSo my personal life is a mess. My physical health s\\*cks, my mental health s\\*cks. I don't have many friends and my dating life is an absolute failure. I feel like a lot of my passions are being taken away from me one by one. The Coronavirus is going to make it impossible to make new friends. The Riots have shown me that a lot of country hates me for my very existence. They hate me just for being a white conservative male.\n\nI am a walking contradiction. I don't want to die and don't have to guts to but I've lost most of my will to live. I've wasted my youth, my best days are behind me and not in front of me and I no longer have any zest for life. Deep down pretty much nothing makes my happy anymore. Sure some activities dull the pain temporarily but I've lost the ability to feel happy. I've lost the ability to connect with people. I've lost any ability to have empathy or compassion. I just feel like I don't care anymore.\n\nI don't know what I'm asking for out of this, I just had to finally get it out. I really don't know what to do at this point. If I could I really wish there was a \"do over\" button that we could press and start again. I wouldn't make all the mistakes I've made in my life. I would try to not be so da\\*n introverted when I was younger which made it hard to make friends. I would've traveled the world before my health made my ability to travel by air an iffy proposition. I would've tried more activities to maybe find a passion.\n\nI don't anymore guys. It just all feels so hopeless. If I had to use one emotion to describe myself at this very moment I think that's the one I would use. Hopeless.\n\nFeel free to reply with what you want. I'm alone again on a Saturday night anyway. I've got nowhere else to be and nothing better to do.",

In the next hour I was rushed in by ambulance for a more serious attempt. Which could have been avoided if the doctor actually would have listend to me. \n\nThe attempt caused me to have surgery. Note, I’m extremely anxious about anesthesia etc. So I tried to walk away, the nurses forced me back in bed. After a couple of minutes i tried to walk away again, this time they put me into seclusion. I told them i didn’t want to take off my pants because of a recent rape, they proceeded to push me to the ground and forced them of me. This made me have a severe panick attack. I was left alone.\n\nAfter a while I got out of seclusion, still visibly upset. They wanted to put the saturation thiny on my finger but I didn’t give it straight away because i was wiping my tears. I got dragged to seclusion because of this. \n\nThis morning I got the surgery, i tried to comply as much as possible. The surgery went well and i got into a recovery room. The doctor came and told me I was free to go. I told him I will try to kill myself again. He said that thats a risk he’s willing to take. \n\nRight now I’m sitting on my bathroom floor in tears not knowing what I should do next.\n\nOh and btw, they called my parents. Eventhough I told them i don’t want that. I am 18, so they can’t share information without my consent\n\nThis is just a fraction of what happend. Don’t wamt to share all the details because i don’t want to trigger anyone.",

I constantly think about it. I just want to be free and released. \n\nI am 30F. My parents are in their mid to late 60s. I lost my job back in March because of corona. My mother had a stroke last year and needs constant help with everything. She’s also always been codependent. My father has Parkinson’s and is getting worse slowly. He has always been and continues to be belligerent, verbally and light physical abuse. I am the oldest of 3. My siblings also live at home but one is physically disabled and one is very mentally ill. \n\nI barely get 5 hours of sleep everyday. I constantly go back and forth between taking care of my mom and dad and brother (mentally ill disabled). All bills are on me. Our house is at risk for foreclosure. The house is in my fathers name and I can’t do much because of that. I can’t get him to stand long enough to go to the dmv to renew his ID so he can go to a notary. \n\nI also have an auto immune disease that degenerates your spine slowly but thankfully it’s very slow and I’m still able to do a lot just with chronic pain. I just wish so badly that I can just live for myself. I want to wake up and just solve my own problems. Worry about only myself and feeding myself etc. I’ve never had a chance to live life for myself. I’ve had to help my parents since I was a teenager. \n\nI can only see things getting better once my parents both die but that’s not happening for at least 15 years. I love my mother and don’t want her to die or feel like a burden. She’s trying to do physical therapy and recover. I get so jealous when I see other people my age just being their age. Living on their own, only having to worry about themselves. Only cooking for themselves. Able to do self care and able to go to work. Even if I got a job I will probably lose it because I would have to call out a lot to take care of my family. \n\nWe cannot afford a home health aid. I’ve tried with the insurance they won’t cover it. I’ve tried to get paid as my mothers home health aid; they won’t cover that. I have constant anxiety. I just want to be able to worry about my own problems and take care of myself. I just want my own life. If I’m lucky maybe I’ll be able to start living when I’m almost 50 years old. \n\nI don’t want to commit suicide because I know of the beauty in life. I know it’s possible for me to be happy. I just don’t see a way out alive right now. I didn’t know where else to post. Anywhere else I’ve posted I haven’t had any replies. If you’ve read this, thank you. I wish you a good 2021. \n\nI appreciate any replies.\n\n\nEDIT: I just wanted to edit this post in case anyone checks back. First off, thank you so much for all of the awards and replies. The response has overwhelmed me and made me feel less alone. I hate that other people are going through what I am but it makes me feel like I am not alone. \n\nSecond, just to answer a few common replies. My family has been through social security and disability. My parents are literally dollars over the line set by the government for SNAP and other assistance. We have been denied many times. My sister receives disability but it took many denials and paying a lawyer in order to get it. It’s also a very small amount. My brother was also denied and a lawyer says mental health disabilities are harder to get approved. If anyone has info or has been through getting disability for mental health reasons (my brother has schizophrenia), please reach out to me.  \n\nRecently we applied for disability for my mother and she was denied because of my father’s pension and not having enough working credits. My mom turns 62 in June so we are looking forward to her early basic social security and maybe being able to get her on Medicare. Her private insurance through my dads old work (he’s retired) doesn’t cover paying me as a home health aid or even hiring a professional home health aid. I am hoping that’s something I can do through Medicare when my mom can get it.\n\n\nMy father recently got Medicare but after doing a screening with a nurse and everything they say he doesn’t qualify to pay for a home health aid. My father has his good days still and loves to hide his abusive and weak side. I tried to get my father into a nursing home but he doesn’t meet the criteria. In may my father stayed at a inpatient rehab after a fall, for about 2 weeks. I told the social worker all the issues going on. I told the doctor who asked why he was on psych meds, that he was abusive and I didn’t want him to come home. That I didn’t want to and couldn’t care for him AND my mother. That his moods were unstable. The doctor offered nothing, wouldn’t even change his meds or offer a plan for discharge. No one flinched at me saying I can’t care for him or that he’s abusive. They simply didn’t see it as their problem to help. Even the social worker. \n\nI have tried getting snap benefits for myself but because I live with my parents they’re included in the household. I also forgot to mention I live just outside of NYC. So our mortgage is very expensive as you can imagine. \n\nI am sorry if I rambled. I’m trying to get out and remember all of the details. The most important thing I have to say is THANK YOU. To everyone that awarded, replied, messaged, and even just read my post. I promise you I am NOT going to kill my self. I don’t have plans or ever make or think about plans. I just felt hopeless and felt like no one else was listening. From the bottom of my heart thank you to this subreddit.",

    "selftext": "Hello, everyone. Pretty long rant ahead so grab something if you care to read.\n\nI'm a 17-year-old dude, I live somewhere in North Africa, I've been dealing with mental illness for more than 3 years now. I'm kinda traumatized because of all the bullying I've been dealing with since I was young, I don't really get bullied now but I can get verbally hurt as I can't really deal with the other party due to the lack of my social skills. Anyways, I didn't have any chance to make a good long-term friendship in my short life. Mostly, they get bored of me or I just push them away. I decided to go to a therapist because those problems were affecting me in a very bad way and distracting me from studying. But it didn't help much since the therapist wasn't that good. I decided to cut myself and do other forms of self-harm, whether it's starving myself or purging whatever I ate, etc.. A year later, my parents noticed my unhealthy behavior and decided to take me to a psychiatrist, I was diagnosed then with Schizophrenia and Severe Depression, I began to take medications and they helped me a lot but the side effects were taking away a lot from me, my memory was and still pretty corrupted and I wasn't able to do everyday activity, in addition to blurry vision, vertigo, etc., I was in the last year of High School and exams came so I stopped going to the psychiatrist. I got a really bad grade despite doing my best, I stopped taking my medications cold turkey. I went to a below-average college and my mental state is really declining. I was able to get a pistol but my parents found out about it. My plan was ruined and I'm under some kind of suicide watch. I really can't take it anymore, just everyone telling me to \"Man up!\" and \"A lot of people are going through worse\", I'm also kinda guilt-tripped.\n\nI just came here and wrote this from a throwaway account because no one really listens to me, most of my \"friends\" can't really be relied on, and I felt like taking this off my chest. Thanks to whoever read the whole thing.",

    "title": "I was born a hermaphrodite and I want to die because of it.",
    "selftext": "I don't even know how to put all of my thoughts down properly here. I've been having terrible emotional breakdowns lately and I have no idea if talking about it will even help. All of the problems in my life are directly tied to a condition I was born with and how I've been treated because of it.\n\nBased on what I know, when I was born my biological sex was ambiguous and doctors tried to have me surgically \"corrected\" into a female. My parents have denied knowing anything about it, but they refuse to let me have access to my medical records even though I'm an adult. The only reasons I have information about it are because of scars, genital pain, and hormone/ internal ultrasound testing from my gyno.\n\nNothing about my body is sexually correct. I have breasts, but I have male pattern chest hair and pubic hair. I have what should be a vagina, but it's actually just a small hole so narrow that I can't even use a tampon, much less have sex with it. I was born with a phallus, but they shaved it down until it was the appropriate size to be a clitoris. It hurts a lot now, even as an adult. Its like a terrible stinging sensation that gets so bad sometimes that it's brought me to tears before. I can't even touch the left side of it because it stings and burns so badly. \n\nI've always known that something was wrong about my body, even as a kid I knew that certain things weren't right and that I didn't feel the way that other girls did. My parents refused to acknowledge it and hid everything from me.\n\nMy parents were very rigid about gender roles when I was growing up and they punished me whenever I didn't behave like my forcibly assigned sex. Most of my earliest memories are of me crying because I was forced to wear dresses, makeup, and necklaces. I vividly remember begging my mom not to pierce my ears and spending my whole childhood wishing my ears would close up again because wearing earrings made me feel deeply sick.\n\nWhen I got older, it just got worse. My parents wouldn't let me have hobbies or join clubs that they thought \"weren't for my gender.\" they stopped me from doing even simple things like learning to play the trumpet. They refused to ever let me cut my hair above shoulder length and would only let me wear clothes that were \"girl colors\". If I did anything that deviated from what they wanted, they would scream at me and call me a faggot or a dyke. Even now as an adult living in their house they do this, and they've said physically threatening things like \"You're not too old for us to spank you.\" \n\nWhen I turned 18 I started having serious medical problems. I ended up with an exceedingly rare kidney disorder from a hormone imbalance that came from the surgeries I was forced to have as a baby. I nearly died from it that winter, but still my parents told me nothing about my medical history. \n\nI didn't get diagnosed until I was 20, when my pain was getting so horrific that I had to quit school and my job. I went for my first visit to a gyno and she told me that I was abnormal. I felt like a complete idiot when she told me. My parents had always pulled  me out of sex ed in school, and I was raised in such a strict religious environment that I sincerely had never seen what anatomy was supposed to look like.\n\nAnd I felt so broken and stupid then. \n\nI was so scared of what would happen that I didn't tell my parents anything that my doctor told me. I had been dating my boyfriend for years already and I was so scared to tell him that I waited months before I said anything to him either. \n\nI just feel like such a failure. I was never even remotely happy as a woman, but I know that my family, my boyfriend, and everyone else could never accept me as a man either. And I've never felt like a man in the first place. I've always felt like I was something between that, even as far back as I can remember. But I know that people could never understand that. Even someone as loving, patient, and kind as my boyfriend can't fully understand how deeply this hurts me.\n\nI feel so completely alone in the world. I feel mutilated. I feel like a disappointment to my family because I can never be what they wanted physically or emotionally. I can't take the pain anymore either. I'm constantly peeing blood and my kidney feels like a knife in my back. I've been suffering from depression and dysphoria since early childhood, and years of therapy haven't helped me. \n\nI just want it to end. No more talk from my parents about how my entire existence is a sin. No more feeling like I'm a horrible mistake. And no more feeling like it's going to destroy my relationship and hurt the only person who ever truly loved me. \n\nI wish there were a way to fix this. I wish my parents had left my body alone and raised me in a way where I could have been myself. But now I feel so lost and alone that I don't even know who or what I am.\n",

I know a lot about my field as I practice it every now and then by working with a licensed engineer. I don't make a lot of money from it though but the things I learned that is connected to the degree program is what kept me from blanking when asked by my family about my academic life.\n\nI have run out of time. The graduation from the University is 10 days away and everyone thinks I am graduating. And I am somewhat happy, that I can finally end my life. I have been such a big disappointment for my parents. I am their only child. I cry everytime I imagine what my mom would feel after I do it. My girlfriend, who by the way also doesn't know anything broke up with me yesterday, which makes the goodbye part of it all very hard. I have planned everything out already, from what i'll use to when and where. I just wanted to vent some of the heaviness from my chest. I feel so sad about my parents and my (ex) girlfriend. I am gonna start writing my suicide letters tomorrow. Thank you guys.",

    "selftext": "A few years ago when I was suicidal I was lied to by my therapist and told we were going to the hospital for an emergency prescription change. At the time, it made sense. But looking back I feel like such an idiot. \n\nAs I got to the hospital I was honest about how I felt suicidal, but made no plans to commit suicide, and had no method. The doctor told me that soon he’d have a discussion with me about what would be best for me. The second they got me a wheelchair I knew my mistake. I shouldn’t have been honest at all. They all lied to me. There was no discussion, no prescription change. They locked me up in the hospital and for three days I didn’t even know how long I’d be there. \n\nWhen I finally got to meet with the doctors there, they wouldn’t listen to me and continuously mocked me and treated me like a child. They were obsessed with stupid parts of my life and wouldn’t listen to my diagnosis I told them I already had (Episodic Depression or Major Depressive? I forget because it’s been a few years and we’ve talked about other things) what I do remember is that at the end of the week they said they diagnosed me with the one I already said I have, like it was new!!!! Like THEY diagnosed me and not my psychiatrist at college!! \n\nOne of the stupid things they were obsessed with was my relationship with my best friend (who is a guy- I’m a woman) and I had to repeatedly clarify he was a friend and they kept trying to get more information about it. It was so fucking weird. Like they asked me who my support system was and I said, “my friends, like this girl, that girl, and Guy” and they’re like WHO IS GUY!!!!!!!!!!! Like it would be such an enlightening thing for me to elaborate on even though I already said he’s a friend of mine. \n\nI had made some friends while I was in there. Some I still keep in contact with. But worst was just that Im now thousands of dollars in debt from this whole experience. \n\nI had nightmares for weeks. The anxiety of being locked up completely against your will with no way to contact the outside world but a monitored phone did real damage to me. Having no privacy, no real clothes, being constantly treated like a child- it was all so terrible. \n\nIt sucked. It wasn’t worth it. I’ve learned to NEVER tell a therapist you’re suicidal.",

    "selftext": "Context:  We were having an argument about consent. I always wear shorts at home and our house is pretty conservative and packed with family members, with a few older men such as my cousins and uncle. I always get anxious so I have this habit of bouncing my leg up and down. My mom scolded me about it multiple times, telling me to not do it because it means “attracting people to have sex with me” ( I am 16 by the way, the youngest in our household with the exception of my nephew). This time she was in a bad mood and unfortunately caught me bouncing my leg while wearing shorts which means my upper thigh is a bit shown. We were upstairs in the bedroom and she was using a small knife to cut off the straw from a box of groceries. The moment she caught me she fucking yelled at me saying that I was being a whore and stuff like that. I tried reasoning with her calmly and told her it was because I’m anxious about my school but she didn’t budge. She kept blabbering about what might happen if one my cousins or uncle saw what I was doing or the way I was dressed, they’d think I’m inviting them to have sex. I told her that just because I’m doing this does not mean I want to have sex because my neither my actions nor my clothing mean consent. She continued arguing about how they may be my relatives but they’re still “men” and added that she hopes I get raped so I’ll learn my lesson. I tried to counter one last time but then she fucking flung the knife right at me. She obviously missed on purpose but at that moment, my whole life fucking froze. She was fuming at me and said that next time I say things about consent and shit like that she won’t miss anymore.\n\nNow, before I had been doing self harm and once even attempted to commit suicide. In those times, my mom was so hurt for me and kept telling me that my life mattered and all that shit. When I realized how much I was hurting her before I stopped no matter how depressive my state was. But now, my own fucking mother wanted me to die and hell, get raped. You know, I’m thinking, maybe I was right before. About just dying. Everyday I think about dying but I try so hard to stop myself from having these thoughts because I love my mama. But just when I’m starting to recover, my own mother wants me dead and literally fucking flung a knife at me. Sure, she missed but what if she didn’t? What if it didn’t kill me but left me fucking incapacitated? What if did really kill me? I was happy that I’m slowly getting better but right now, I might as well be better off gone.\n\n\nEdit: Hi, so I just want to let you guys know that this was the first time I’ve ever talked about my problems at home. I don’t talk about it to literally anyone, even my friends and I do not have a therapist. I just wanna say thank you for all the support and I promise I’ll try my best to stay here. :D\n\nEdit 2: Just wanna inform you guys that my mom has high blood pressure which might explain her explosive attitude but most certainly won’t excuse them. From now on, I’ll refrain from arguing with her for the sake of both of our health. Also, for everyone telling to hit up CPS, I appreciate your advices but our country’s CPS here is mostly for juveniles (correct me of I’m wrong) and like, rebellious kids I think and kinda treats them badly so I don’t think they’d do my mental health any better. Strange as it may be, my mom is the only parent I have left since my dad’s out the picture (another reason why I stopped trying to kill myself, I didn’t want my mom to be alone). She’s all I have right now and basically, all I can do right now is try to keep things as smooth as possible to avoid any more trouble in the future.",

I feel at peace with the idea, but I haven't made any specific plans yet on the method.  \n\n\nThe reasons why I'm suicidal and why I'm moving are really similar. I feel so broken and tired. I've battled mental illness for 12 of the 24 years I've been alive. It's really drained me and robbed me of my full potential. Whenever I seem to find a little bit of calm in between big storms, things come crashing down. \n\nI'm a high functioning depressed person. I have an active social life. I have a good job. I have some good hobbies. I try to see a therapist and take medication. But deep down, there's a lot of darkness I carry. Nobody knows at work that I constantly question how I should take my life everyday, or if life is worth living. It's the first thought through my head when I wake up. When I've tried to open up to people, they treat me like I'm a burden or a liability. I feel so trapped in a persona that I've built for myself - I put up a facade of a happy and energetic person. I decided to set a date to move to leave everything behind and start a new life. But the big secret I carry is I don't want to start over.\n\nI've really struggled. I've taken countless meds, I've seen a therapist for over three years. I've learned to lie to my boss or people close to me about how I've been feeling. I'm really tired. I tried to kill myself when I was 12 and got hospitalized. I thought that was a low point I would rebuild from. Six years later, when I was 18, my girlfriend hung herself. This year, I got diagnosed with bipolar II. I'm sick of countless crazy side effects from these psychiatric drugs. I don't want to keep having to try to fight this for the rest of my life.\n\nSo in 26 days, my friends will all get together for one last party.

I could move 800 miles away, but that only brings me opportunity to just get hurt again. I don't want to live anymore. I love the people in my life so much, but I can't carry this anymore. I want to die so badly.  \n\n\nI know this will break some people close to me. That tears me up so bad. But in the end, this is something I need to do for myself.",

Yet, strangely, I have no regrets. I just feel sorry for anyone unfortunate enough to have had a bad husband, a bad son, or a bad father like me. So goodbye, then ...\"\n\nLuigi Tenco.\n\nDalida – \"Life is unbearable for me. Forgive me.\"\n\nKurt Cobain.\n\nAnna Kavan – “I haven't felt anything for 20 years.”\n\nAlejandra Pizarnik.\n\nVsevolod Garshin.\n\nSteve Cash.\n\nMark Linkous.\n\nGeorge Sanders – “Dear World, I am leaving because I am bored. I feel I have lived long enough. I am leaving you with your worries in this sweet cesspool. Good luck.”\n\nAnd countless more.\n\nAll those artists, writers and musicians who brought joy and comfort to my life, they all suffered throughout theirs, and died young due to severe addictions or eventually killed themselves.\n\nFor years, I haven’t enjoyed anything. I want nothing from this life – I want out.",

    "selftext": "This isn't the \"coward's\" way out. It really isn't.\n\nEven though I'm unbelievably fortunate this method is relatively painless, quick, and unassuming enough not to look gruesome, a part of me *is* scared. I used to say \"when I have a peaceful method, it'll be easy..\" but now that the time has come, I was really naive. I believe in the afterlife and consciousness after death, but I honestly don't mind if I am just unaware and I'm no more troubled than when I'm asleep..\n\nTo the people reading, I am so, so sorry you are trapped in atrocious circumstances or suffering such as war, unjust treatment, domestic violence, inescapable poverty, loneliness, crimes against humanity, the terror of being your biological gender but not having the resources and support to transition, and so many other injustices you do not deserve. This world is unabashedly brutal and horrible and I'm disheartened and disgusted that this the world we live in. I see you're trying to defend your fire against forces greater than yourself, and I am proud of you for living another day. Some days are more overpowering than others, but I want you to understand that is no reflection of inherent unworthiness or lack on your part. You are doing what you can with the tools (if any exist) you understand how to use, so please do not beat yourself up more than you are already breaking. Thank you for the chance you read this and we met. I wish to you all for external and internal resources come your way, freedom from suffering, empowerment, autonomy, courage, healing, resilience, personal fulfillment, growth, mercy and comfort for yourself, total fulfillment of your basic and inherent needs, and an abundance moments of expansive and loving joy. ♡\n\nI even wish this for the people that have hurt me or willingly harmed others, because if we all possessed these things—especially the latter (as suffering is inevitable to some degree)—there would be no need or desire to cause harm. They could connect with others and themselves in the most positive and fulfilling of ways. At least.. that's how I feel.\n\nI wish I could have made a great and bright impact on the world. The reason I am probably so hesitant is that my life has barely begun. I'm twenty years old. If I gave myself twenty to thirty years, I could probably gauge my impact, figure out what is wrong and strive for something better for everyone. I wish everyone felt that way to some degree. Though, some people are afraid of opening Pandora's box and don't realize they're actually in it.\n\nIf you read all this, thank you for reading. I hope I could make your day a little bit better. Thank you.\n\n  \n**Update (10/04/24)** :\n\nI missed my ticket.  A few days ago, I tried to die and woke up the next morning with the most excruciating migraine and bodily weakness of my life. I still feel a bit weak. I see where I messed up a step and why I lived.  As of now, I'm on the margins of figuring out what to do next. Even though mind is in a weird place, I do know that I'd like to thank and hug everyone who felt moved by my note. \n\nIt is fact there is endless and boundless suffering in life. I am so sorry you cannot escape your undeserved agony, and I have my deepest compassion for your trying. You do not deserve this in the first place. For those whose suffering is more than they are capable of enduring, and whose challenges are practically insurmountable, I send you the highest and brightest peace, self-love and courage and my respect for your autonomy to make the best possible choice for yourself. To those who choose to pursue living, I eagerly support you to continue! I know it is hard. This cycle of inner struggle—spiraling, self-doubt, bitterness, frustration, delusion—is baked into our humanity, and we may never fully step out of that cycle until our last breath. But you know what? While we are alive, I rejoice in the days, moments, minutes, and seconds to spare you aren't caught in that cycle and feel connected with and free.\n\nI purposely didn't elaborate what pushed me to suicide in my note, because this note isn't about me; it is about you. Whether you sobbed, felt your stomach drop in fear, or clenched your fists in self-frustration, I dream you confront what your subconscious yearns for and achieve it. \n\nIf I may include, this world *is* unbelievably fucking awful and cruel and full of suffering. I cannot dress up that undeniable truth in pretty words and still keep my integrity.\n\n Knowing this—nearly dying—I realize there are things I wanted to do. I wanted to make the world a better place. I wanted to make people smile, to make people laugh. I wanted to lower people's guards and help them feel joy again. I wanted to ease people's stress and invite laughter. I wanted to help people open their Pandora's box and show them there is still merit in staying in this world despite the horrors. I wanted every interaction I have to be raw, energetic, vulnerable, and alive, so that no one ever felt warranted to question my intentions; instead, they remember the humanity flowing in their veins. I wanted to wake up every morning and feel self-confident from sunrise to sunset, knowing that this is the gift I would deliver to you personally, and I would do it again and again and again. \n\n...Now, despite that..\n\n ..I am just as much as hesitant to live as I was to die. Even though I feel in tune with my life's purpose, the lack of noise in death fulfills a large part of me that life cannot. If I had given myself another twenty-five to thirty years, I could have departed on my deathbed with my head held high and spine erect. But that isn't now. Frankly, a part of me wishes it were. I type this in hopes that maybe it will resonate with someone out there, and know that you aren't alone in feeling this way. \n\nThank you for reading this. Have a good day, everyone. ♡",

Her \"apology\" wasn't even sincere. She was laughing, looking away, rolling her eyes, as if the whole thing was a fucking joke.\n\nMy mom told the both of us that the situation between us has gotten way out of hand, and wants to do family counseling.

I asked over and over again, but she didn't answer it.\n\nThe next day, I told my therapist that I tried to kill myself and she told me that I had to tell my mom. I told her, and she burst into tears. I also told her about all the hurtful things my sister said to me over the years.\n\nMom: Why didn't you tell me any of this?\n\nMe: I thought you wouldn't believe me, because you and dad always knew her as a nice person.\n\nEventually, we had to tell dad about what happened. And for the first time, he cried. I've never seen him cry before. And it broke my heart to see my parents like this.\n\nMy mom scheduled a session with my therapist on 7/29/19 *with* my sister. But I'm worried that my sister will start lying to my therapist and will try to manipulate her to make it seem like everything was my fault. But my therapist says that she is trained to not fall for that, since she knows my side of the story.\n\nI was told that her boss was going to be there, too, because she's only involved in a session if it involves *serious* cases, such as suicide.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the silver!",

I've been with  Psychiatric Teams, and a few Therapists. It's all a temporary measure in  the end.\n\nI am a 'High Performer' in my  workplace, and I have many who rely on me for support. I always smile,  and I try my best to make others happy whenever I can. But at the end of  every day, I feel empty. Most times I have suicidal thoughts. There are  people I am able to speak to and 'open up' about how I feel, however  you can only share how you truly feel one so many times before it  becomes a burden upon them.\n\nIn more  recent times, my negative thoughts are becoming more prominent. I have a  strong feeling I may be edging towards attempting suicide once again.  I've taken a few days off work hoping it may help, however I believe  with the absence of working it allows my head to fester these urges and  suicidal thoughts more rapidly.\n\nThere is a  brief moment of what I can only describe as insanity that grips me, and  it is at that moment where my life hangs in the balance. Whether it's  my belt around my neck, a blade against my wrist, or pills in my palm. I  have managed to so far overcome each mental battle in those moments in  these past few weeks, however it is likely I may soon lose.\n\nI  am not here for advice or sympathy, the purpose for this post is to  just say Depression does not discriminate. You do not have to have been  through a traumatic event, or to have certain physical attributes you  hate, feeling alone etc. to be depressed. Sometimes you just are, and it  could be for no particular reason at all. We are all human in the end,  and we're all on the same spectrum. Best wishes to you all.",

    "selftext": "Hear me out. \n\nI can understand why people commit suicide. And I think it’s selfish for loved ones of those who did commit to call them selfish for “leaving them”. No. \n\nA person suffering from severe mental health conditions that cause them to be suicidal - they can do all the work to get better. They can go to therapy, they can take their medication, they can go to the gym and eat healthy, they can work and save money, they can be social and see their friends and family every other day, they can study for a degree they really want… but once those feelings of depression, and loneliness and isolation and emptiness come back for them, it’s so easy to forget the good things you have in your life (I.e. a loving family, a good job, a good gym routine, whatever it is).\n\nBut to expect your loved one who has committed suicide to continue living in this vicious cycle of being well and then unwell (whether it’s because of trauma, a diagnosed disorder, a chemical imbalance, etc) - THAT is selfish. Because unless they also suffer from mental health issues that cause suicidal thoughts and ideation, they will never understand the severity of their condition. They will never understand why they want to die despite all the good things they have in their life. \n\nSo for someone who has been successful in their suicide attempt, I can totally understand why they did it. Even if it’s someone who isn’t doing the work to get better (I.e. no therapy, no meds - just straight rawdogging), I can still understand why they want to die and commit suicide, or why they committed suicide.\n\nI am not at all saying that you should go about committing suicide. I think everyone’s life is important and can be meaningful despite their mental health issues. HOWEVER, if they do feel this way and do try or do end up killing themselves, I would never call them selfish for it because I understand why they would do, or did what they did.\n\n",

    "selftext": "My brother killed himself on Xmas Eve  when I was extremely young. I still have very vivid memories of it, and the way my family handled it leads me to believe that it didn't really bother them. No one talks about it or mentions him. They have practically erased him from our family's history. Maybe it's because they were ashamed he was gay. Or maybe they were ashamed that he died of suicide. \n\nMaybe both.\n\nEither way, I want to join him.. Now that I've grown up, I understand why he did what he did. I understand that he wasn't wrong, and I don't feel like I'd be in the wrong for doing the same... I'd be doing the world a favor.\n\nI feel like my life has done nothing but spin out of control since I was a child. It's been nothing but chaos. I was preconditioned not to ever trust. I was sexually abused and pimped out to my stepdad's friends. My mother stayed with a known pedophile while I was relegated to foster care and group homes. \n\nI feel like I wasn't ever even just given a fair chance. Yet, I went on to get married once a upon a time. I had two kids. I got a divorce. I started a business. I got my bachelor's degree. I bought a house. \n\n...And then I became addicted to alcohol. \n\nI made so many stupid choices leading up to now, and because of that, I now have nothing. My children moved to another state with their father after the courts decided he and his wife were better suited to be their parents. And the courts were correct. I'm a fuck up. There's no telling where we'd end up if they were here, but it would probably be within the confines of a cardboard box. I've been sober for almost this entire past yea, minus maybe four or five total slip-ups.. I thought that might fix a lot of my issues, but it hasn't fixed a thing. \n\nI destroyed my last relationship. I hurt my partner in countless ways. After we broke up for a month, he begged me to come back, and I swore I'd do better or try to be better. I tried as hard as I could.. but I've had to accept that being a shitty person is just who I am. I can't change that about myself, it's embedded in my personality. I broke him into tiny shards of glass, and all he could do when I tried to pick up the pieces was hurt me back. I turned a good person into a horrible, conniving man...\n\nI can't get the job I want. All of my stuff is in storage and I can't pay the bill before the storage place puts a lien on it and keeps it all forever - even the sentimental items like the gifts my children have made for me. Their ultrasounds. Their footprints from their first day alive... My car is gone now, too.. I can't drive to get to work. I can't drive to an interview. I can't drive to a doctor or a mental hospital. I live in the middle of nowhere, and I have no resources. I can't take on new clients and make money. I've fallen as far down the hole as I can, and there's no way back up.\n\nI've had my friends tell me that I should be proud.. that I should just stick things out, because things will get better. But things will never improve, and I haven't felt like I could tell them to what extent my life has become unmanageable.. \n\nThere is literally no way to return to the life that I worked so hard to build, or to better myself and actually do something meaningful with my art or myself as a human being. I don't have the money, I don't have the resources, and I am too afraid to ask my friends or \"family\" for help. \n\nI feel like they'd be far less inconvenienced if I just didn't exist. I feel like my kids would only have to face one big disappointment instead of a bunch of big disappointments throughout their entire life. I feel like all of the work I put into becoming a valuable human life was all for nothing. I feel like I am a waste of oxygen and space. I feel like all I do is destroy people, and hurt their feelings. \n\nI have no one. My mother and I are estranged. My remaining siblings and I hardly ever talk. I'm incapable of nurturing a relationship. I'm incapable of being a mother just like my mother was.\n\nI have nothing left, and I have no more motivation to continue on.\n\nI just want to disappear. I want it to appear that I just left without saying a word. No one would notice, because I have done nothing but isolate myself from everyone. I am so ashamed of my life and what it has devolved into, and I don't want to face anyone or burden them with my problems. I don't want to keep trying to fix something that isn't fixable. \n\nI'm a fucked up person in a fucked up world. People keep trying to tell me that I have so much to live for - that I have so much talent and potential. People keep telling me to keep trying, but they aren't the ones who have to try so it's easy for them. They don't have to live with me, I do. I hate who I am and who I've become. \n\nI know that I'm sorry. I cannot even begin to describe the remorse that I feel for all of my selfish behaviors, and my depressed demeanor that just brings everyone down. I wish I had treated everyone better: my kids, my kids' dad and his wife, my friends and my remaining family...\n\nI'm everything that I never wanted to be - practically homeless, with absolutely nothing. I have no personality. I have nothing positive to add to the world. I've become so jaded to the thought of dying - like it's going to happen someday, so why do I (and others) keep trying to delay the inevitable? \n\nI'm sorry if this seemed rambley. I had considered writing letters to a couple of people, but I figure putting it here - anonymously - would be better. I don't want my kids to know I killed myself... so I'm going to disappear to a place where I will never be found. I don't want to tell anyone about it in case they try to change my mind. I'm afraid they'll think I'm just begging for attention. Or maybe they will think I don't mean what I say... but I really do want to die.\n\nThanks, Reddit.",

    "selftext": "I'll quickly introduce myself. I'm Louis, 18 years old Frenchman, and my life completely changed in the span of 3 months. From being a successful student, having excellent grades and a whole plan for my future, I went to being unmotivated, mentally troubled and in the end unable to being a part of the society. Until September, I always wanted to become someone. Doing great studies, achieving great feats, having a wonderful wife and a beloved family. I had the most human dream possible. The most basic of all. I just wanted to be a normal guy, living my life happy as I've always been, and as I've always thought I would be.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn September, I've entered one of the best colleges of France, I was excited and ready to succeed. I wanted to give my best, as I've always done before. But since then, I've lost a part of myself. In fact, I've always been someone very rational. Always questioning myself on every little thing that could happen in my life. In my entire life, I think I've spent more time with myself (talking in my head) than anyone else, which I think is not that uncommon. The thing is, I've come to realize that living is just boring as fuck. Living is such a pain, it's ridiculous. And even more than that, it's useless. This message is a way to express my opinion on life, and why I consider it as a burden.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe first thing I've come to realize when I entered adulthood, is that life is just so repetitive. It's a cycle that never ends. Every day you wake up, every day you eat, every day you work, every day you sleep. So predictable. Every single human being is forced to do these things. And for most, it doesn't even bother them, as it never bothered me before. We just comply because we're used to. It's just normal. But once you just think of it, you feel enslaved. You just need to. You need to, but do I want it ? It doesn't matter. Eat, or you die. Drink, or you die. Work, or you die. The last one is the most important one. In 3 months, I've just come to hate the very concept of working. For me, it's more studying, which was my biggest quality even 3 months ago. I could work hours without any trouble. I would be happy doing it. Because I felt like I had a goal right ? One day, it would all make sense, all this work and devotion ? But will it ever make sense ? In fact, it won't ever make sense. Because you'll be forced to work all your life anyway. You study for degree, then you work for money, then you die. But you need to do it, it's your fate as a human being. Work and shut up. I'm 18, and already bored.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat I've said is nothing extraordinary. I don't feel like anything special and many must go through the same process. But I don't even comprehend how you can enjoy living anymore. Living is just so absurd, in the sense that we will all die some day. We are all condemned to death the very second we are born. Disappearing is our fate. Dying is our destiny. Why bother living knowing such a terrible truth ? I've read countless forums, and most of the time, people would answer some obvious things like : \"If we're meant to die, then let's enjoy the time we have anyway !\". But that's the most stupid I could ever think of ? Enjoying a life that you know is bound to fade is just deceiving yourself. It’s like putting on the mask that just fell, hiding the reality that you've discovered, acting like it doesn't exist ! I CAN'T DO THAT ! I'll die and I know it ! It takes so much strength to deceive yourself. To enjoy things. To not think. People won't get that. Do people even know that they will die ? I see them smiling, having fun, achieving things. Do they know it won't make any difference ? As a human being, we can't achieve anything great enough that will objectively have sense. Most people have dreams that make them live. Helping others, winning a competition... But it's so fucking fake. You are just a mere human and you will die like everybody else. That I die know or in 70 years, what changes ? I would have lived 70 years of asking myself \"Why ?\" and in the end, it wouldn't have meant anything.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAchieving on this planet is just an illusion. If you win the World Cup (allez la France !), it doesn't change the fact that you're destined to die. As any species, humans will disappear one day. Everything that is considered as precious by society, and that was once my dream -- having a successful career, having money, founding a family, being virtuous --, it only has value because there are other persons to acknowledge you and the thing you have. Money makes you able to buy pretty much everything in this world because everyone has come to value it highly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy point is that life is just a game that doesn't make sense at all. You have nothing to win. People will comply to the rules even without having read them. They just play the game because why not ? We are here, let's play ! But I am here, one of the few that read the rules, and I feel like an outcast. I'm forced to play the game even though I did not ask for it. I am forced to wake up even though I've nothing to win at all. I don't want anything. I don't want money. I don't want a wife. I don't want to work. I don't want to live. The game is rigged and I don't want to play. Everyone acts like everything is so important, but it's just an illusion. Nothing is important in itself. Because us, humans, are just so ridiculously meaningless. Life is meaningless. And unfortunately, I'm not able to accept this reality. I can't avoid it anymore.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo come back to my personal situation, I've dropped out one month ago. I've broke down before my parents, and they've brought me back home. I feel worse than ever. I have no purpose. My parents, even though they've been very comprehensive, have started to pressure me more and more, as they should do. I'm being humiliated every single time they tell this story to anyone. I've isolated myself to everyone too. I've got no friends. I don't want any. I don't even want to talk to my family. I ghost anyone that sends messages, because I don't want to talk again and again about this miserable situation. I'm so lost. I just want to be free. I don't want to keep doing this bullshit anymore. I have questioned myself about freedom. Can you be free as a human being ? Physically, we are restricted by our bodies. But mentally, as long as you follow your own rules, you're free. I don't think I can be free in this world, as long as I'm alive. My dream is to escape this whole bullshit. But I can't. Maybe I could be free once I die, who knows ?",

I am being honest.\n\nSomeday I am sure suicide will be my only option. Then the fear of hellfire will be gone.

    "selftext": "First, thank you for opening the post. I'm sharing a bit of my story to try to prevent bad things to happen to me. Please share your thoughts or advise in life. Summary is that I spent all my life savings trying to get trained in the greedy USA healthcare system, but to this day after 15 years of formal education and experience, I continue to be unemployed and financially useless, now struggling with COVID19 lockdown, depression and suicide ideas. \n\nYoung male physician here, 29 yrs, from Latin America (yes, we also use reddit) I've been having suicide thoughts, but not currently depressed. I feel like a fucking failure in life.\n\nSince school I aced exams, test, scores, got honors on my graduation, was extremely dedicated, learned guitar, learned english, I was always either the best or among the best and had high aspirations. Went to the University at age 16 and I stupidly decided to study medicine and become a miserable doctor, let me explain. Medicine is a TOUGH CAREER, very difficult. It is academically, mentally and economically demanding. The amount of stuff you need to study each year is massive, and drains you mentally, socially isolates you from family, friends, parties, relationships, etc.  A dark truth of a recent grad is that you are bullied by superiors or more experienced doctors, pretty much everywhere, medical residency is like that and I seriously suffered that BS during my 1-year medical internship, at that time they evaluated me, so I had no word to defend myself. But I graduated after 8 years of traning (in my country).\n\nEscaping common crime violence in my country, I went to USA to become a doctor there, by passing the USMLE exams (the most difficult exams ever in my life) I spent 2 more years studying for those expensive exams, and another year getting doing unpaid clerkships to get experience and recommendations and connections. Life in the US as immigrant if TOUGH man! Nobody wants to employ you due to visa. You cannot earn any money. I did cleaning, mopping floors, dog walking and other odd jobs to support me (WHICH IS ILLEGAL AS FOREIGNER). When I had all the requirements, guess what? You have to pay fees of applications to participate in the selection process of residency in the USA each year, so I spent $5000 only in applications and flying tickets. I received few interviews in hopes to get a job, but did not get anything, and lost $5000. I tried again next year and the results were the same with same dollars lost. I felt fucking scammed, and to this day i'm still angry at my experience in the USA.  I spent like $70,000 of my third-world-hard-earned dollars in the whole process, paying rents, bills and educational courses to prepare and in the end the result was nothing. NOBODY WILL EMPLOY YOU IN HEALTHCARE IF YOU DON'T DO A RESIDENCY FIRST, which I failed to secure twice. And NOBODY will employ you at any job in the US if you are not citizen. 5 stupid years wasted + 8 years of home training.\n\nI came back defeated to my country in hopes to get any job. I faced another reality and that is there are no jobs for doctors here, there are just too many doctors today. I lowered my life expectation even more and looked for any other job available, but then COVID-19 happened. My country is in lockdown, I'm quarantined, unemployed, with no money, no financial power, living with now elderly parents at my old home with rampant crime (paralized temporarily due pandemic), living off the charity of others, unable to move, unable to sleep due suicide thoughts, and writing this. Most of my classmates became specialists or got married or got jobs or moved to other countries. I feel like i'm in the starting line. I'm now almost 30 years old, indebted, single and poor. I'm ashamed of what I experienced, I'm ashamed to say I'm unemployed and have never had a real formal stable job, and still hunting for one. I'm a miserable unemployed doctor.\n\n You want to make it worse? Law in my country requires me to serve in the COVID emergency pandemic when system starts to collapse, totally UNPAID or I could be charged a fine or brief jail time.   \n\nFailure is the word to describe what I am. I hate myself, I constantly punish myself for making bad decisions and I blame my extreme bad luck and also blame the silence of God despite me being religious. Education was in vain in my life. The only thing that prevents me from commiting suicide is my parents, but after I bury them, I think I might take the shot. \n\nI'm sorry you had to read the long post, sometimes I feel I did nothing wrong: I studied, I graduated, I behaved, I followed the rules (and also the USA rules) did not became an asshole, murderer or alcoholic or anything, but still life kicks me in the balls. Then why can't I be offered a fucking job? I no longer care about medicine, I no longer care about myself, but I might care in what you have to say, please react to my life story. I will read you thoroughtly",

All the shows and movies are fake, the food tastes fake, the topics we talk about are fake and a bunch of crap, and everyone knows it, but everyone goes along with it because everyone else does. Everyone lies to each other, fakes friendships, kindness, interest, and emotions – nothing is real. Everyone is shallow, focusing on the most trivial stuff and even getting recognition for it, while people who try to understand and explore existence are mocked and excluded.

    "title": "My BF thinks suicidal people are all weak, cowards and he has zero empathy for anyone who either wants to, attempts to, or has committed suicide (spoiler alert: I am sometimes suicidal)",
    "selftext": "This is really just a rant I have to get off my chest. I don’t even care of no one reads it. \n\nSo quick background: I was clinically diagnosis with major depression, general anxiety disorder and OCD two years ago. Things got so bad I had my first psychosis episode and was hospitalized. I didn’t believe I had any of those illnesses and initially thought the doctors were all stupid and diagnosing me with BS. But at the encouragement of my boyfriend (who I live with) and parents, also later realizing myself the doctors were probably right - upon discharge, I agreed to obtain outpatient services and have been treated ever since with weekly psychotherapy and daily medication.\n\nFlash forward two years - I’m much better - no longer having suicidal thoughts, can hold down a job again, intrusive thoughts are much less frequent and am starting to feel joyful again. \n\nOne of the suggestions of my therapist was to try to communicate with my boyfriend more - it’s clear that we have some major unresolved conflicts and that may be a part of the reason why I have stress, depressive thoughts, and/or unhealthy anxiety. So I’ve been trying to have more conversations so we can work through major disagreements - but of course my boyfriend is resistive and isn’t fond of difficult conservations. (I mean, who is?)\n\nI won’t go through every disagreement lol this would be a novel. But one of the biggest one came up (again) last night. I mentioned (off hand) that I’m glad I don’t have suicidal thoughts anymore. \n\n__Him:__ erm...that’s good but you had no reason to have suicidal thoughts in the first place.\n\n__Me:__ well first of all I did have reasons...secondly I literally couldn’t control those thoughts - they were intrusive and I couldn’t not have them. \n\n__Him:__ can we not talk about suicide or bad/negative thoughts? I’m really uncomfortable with this topic. \n\n__Me:__ ok I know but that’s why I haven’t talked to you about this pretty much ever - and I haven’t even brought up suicide in two years with you.\n\n__Him:__ ok so why bring it up now?\n\n__Me:__ because you’re my partner you said we can talk to each other about everything. Also earlier you said you’re 100% emotionally supportive but I can’t talk to you about mental health and negative thoughts?\n\n__Him:__ I _am _completely supportive but some topics are off limits for some people.\n\n__Me:__ but this is important to me and a part of my recovery process is to talk to close loved ones about my mental health - my parents and most of my close friends also are uncomfortable with this, so you’re one of the few people left I could talk to.\n\n__Him:__ so now your mental health is _my_ responsibility?\n\n__Me:__ no I never said that, but you’re just not a supportive partner if you refuse to even let me say one word about it.\n\n__Him:__ What? So now you’re judging me and calling me a bad partner because I don’t want to talk about a very sensitive topic??\n\n__Me:__ well not in those exact words but... kinda.\n\n__Him:__ Excuuuuse me??? After all we went through? After everything I did for you for the past few years? Cooking for you? Trying to calm you down? After me being supportive the whole time in the hospital and even after?? _I’m_ a bad partner?!\n\n__Me:__ well actually two years ago you actively discouraged me from going to the hospital and said “there’s nothing wrong with you you’re not depressed.”\n\n__Him:__ _how_ could I have known??!! I’m not a doctor!!\n\n__Me:__ you could have encouraged me to go see one?\n\n__Him:__ I thought you were just having a bad day!\n\n__Me:__ I had a bad 12 months and I said I’m not sad I’ve had highly negative thoughts for over 6 months. I told you this before I was diagnosed.\n\n__Him:__ Again, I didn’t know that was a cause for concern.\n\n__Me:__ what about now? You’ve supposedly learned a lot about mental health in the last couple years you say - if a friend of yours told you they’ve been feeling depressive  for 6 months, would you encourage them to go see a doctor?\n\n__Him:__ I don’t know. Depends on who.\n\n__Me:__ Bob (good friend of his, not his real name)\n\n__Him:__ umm probably not, Bob’s a pretty positive person and probably just having a bad period with work or something.\n\n__Me:__ so...you wouldn’t even recommend he talks to a doctor. What’s the harm in that?\n\n__Him:__ I’m not a doctor, and it’s his responsibility to go see one.\n\n__Me:__ but you can at least be a supportive friend.\n\n__Him:__ _How_ am I not supportive?\n\n__Me:__ earlier you said I can talk to you another _anything._ I guess not actually _anything._\n\n__Him:__ of course you can talk to me about anything, _ANYthing_ and _EVERYthing_ in the whole world!\n\n__Me:__ except negative thoughts and suicide?\n\n__Him:__ WHY do you want to talk to me about suicide? WHY? Are you suicidal right now? Do I need to take you to the hospital again?\n\n__Me:__ uhh no...this whole conservation started with me saying I don’t really have those thoughts anymore.\n\n__Him:__ So WHY are you talking about it THEN???\n\n__Me:__ because my doctor said it’s important to talk about past trauma and talking about what it was like for me to be in a downward spiral. It helps me get even better.\n\n__Him:__ ....\n\n__Me:__ so...can I talk about bad thoughts and suicide?\n\n__Him:__ ...\n\n__Me:__ ok so two years ago I really wanted to kill myself.\n\n__Him:__ see right there you lost me. Why? You had no reason to - you were a really positive person and super resilient to challenges you could work through anything.\n\n__Me:__ it was an intrusive thought I couldn’t control. \n\n__Him:__ do you have suicidal thoughts right now?\n\n__Me:__ no.\n\n__Him:__ then stop talking about it. Talk to me when you do have suicidal thoughts. Then I’ll take you to the hospital.\n\n__Me:__ okay...can I talk to you about negative thoughts that are not suicidal?\n\n__Him:__ no because you should be talking to a medical professional.\n\n__Me:__ okay but my appointment is not for another week, it would make me feel better if I talked to someone now.\n\n__Him:__ you want to know my opinion? __Suicidal thoughts and actions are a sign of weakness. And i _despise_ weakness. It’s wrong and I have no empathy, zero empathy for those types of thoughts or actions.__\n\n__Me:__ actually I’d didn’t ask for your opinion. I want you to listen to me talk about my experiences and just listen like a supportive partner would. You don’t have to give any thoughts or opinions. But since you did - so you think I’m weak, you despise me and I deserve no empathy?\n\n__Him:__ no I didn’t say that.\n\n__Me:__ ok so - you despise all weak suicidal people except me?\n\n__Him:__ no you’re putting words in my mouth.\n\n__Me:__ literally what you said.\n\n__Him:__ see? This is why I didn’t want to talk about it. \n\n__Me:__ okay I get it. Talk to you about anything - except for negative mental health topics.\n\n__Him:__ No!!! I never said that!!!\n\nAnyway this went on for a while. Then I of course got angry and annoyed and said some not nice stuff I didn’t mean. As of this morning he is still mad at me. And just now he said - I harassed him all night, was cruel, intentionally tried to hurt him by calling him not supportive and trying to blame my depression on him. Also I need to learn to drop things, know what types of topics to not bring up with someone but oh btw - I can talk to him about _anything._\n\n__Me:__ so can i talk to you about suicide now?\n\n__Him:__ OMG! When someone says “you can talk to me about anything” you should know to just say “ok, thanks.” You’re not supposed to IMMEDIATELY bring up something they ALREADY said they’re uncomfortable talking about!\n\n__Me:__ lol.\n\nI’ve suggested couples counselling to him many times, and for years. He refuses. He says the problem is almost 100% with me and I’m the only one who needs counselling.\n\nHonestly - suicidal thoughts from two years ago - mostly caused by being a horrible work place with a terrible boss, along with arguing with an unsupportive partner at home, with my parents who are also verbally abusive and dismissive of my health concerns, and only one friend who even remotely believed I was depressed. Plus some other stuff I wasn’t conscious of and couldn’t control.\n\nI know at the end of the day my mental health is no one else’s responsibility and it’s up to me to seek help and treatment - which I did - I was the first person to think to go to the hospital initially even though I was skeptical. But I’d ideally just like a friend or family I’m close with who I can talk to about this stuff on occasion. But I guess you can’t always depend on that. Strangers on the internet sometimes will - but it’s still nice to have someone you’re already close with be supportive of you. \n\nFor anyone who wants to say - you should just break up with your boyfriend. Let me just tell you that’s not the first option. We’ve been together for more than 10 years, living together for most of that time, and are common law which is legally the same as married in my country (i.e. may need lawyers to help split). Plus i know for a fact because of this pandemic and loss of hours at work - he can’t afford to live on his own. For me, I could move in with my parents - but they’re sometimes very abusive and it could be an even worse situation for me to be in. \n\nAnyway rant over. Sorry that was so long. __tl;dr__ just read the title lol. Thanks for listening.",

I was going to lay on my bed and bleed out from my wrists and die. \n\nMy mom walked in when I was just lightly scraping my skin to mark where I'd cut later tonight. She said \"I just wanted to see you.\" I had to hide my body under the covers so that I could keep her from seeing what I had done to my arm and my body at that point. She came in and laid down on my bed and rest her head on my lap. \"It's comfortable,\" she said. I tried my best to hold back tears. \n\nShe eventually left and now I'm here, staring at my razorblade, wondering why I'm left here as a sympathetic, pitiful loser.

I can imagine her crying. \n\nI feel like a waste of money and time. The thousands of dollars that have been pumped into me for the promise of a successful future is too much. The time that people have invested in me for relationships and friendships is too much time that would've been better spent anywhere else. The only time I enjoy is time wasted on videogames and music. I am less than mediocre at both. \n\nMy whole life has been infested with lies and attention whoring. I've lied about my age online so that guys wouldn't be afraid to talk to me. I've created a whole new person that interacts with me and my friend group online just so I can make my other friends jealous. I lie to my friends to manipulate them into doing what I want them to do. As for the attention whoring, I've done enough of it in my early teens. At 14, I was telling men online that I was 18. Id send them pictures of myself so that I could get validation. I craved the romantic attention that I never got at that age.\n\nIt's now 12am and I'm still here, scoring my thighs and spitting on the wounds. I've taken breaks while typing this and I feel like I'm ready. I just need some validation that I'm not the only one that knows that their life is completely fucked from decisions made by themselves. \n\nSo. Speaking of decisions that I made that fucked up my life.\nI'm living with 43° scoliosis that gives me severe backpain that (shocker) I have given to myself. I, as the attention whore I was in elementary school, longed for something that would make me different from the other kids at school. I sat in weird postures and slept in strange positions until my spine decided to follow through with my plan. The next scoliosis check that I had, I was told to get checked for scoliosis. Lo and behold, now I'm at a 43° curve that requires a long and painful surgery to fix. \nI also fucked with my eyesight as a child so that I could get glasses. Now I'm stuck with 7mm thick lenses in my glasses that signify that I'm legally blind to anyone that even sees my glasses. \nI AGAIN fucked up my life when I decided to go along with my parents' narrative and pretend to be Christian. Now I've been working at my church for 6 years. I've also been attending and tithing every week. I'm in the worship band and am currently planning a summer retreat. After 14 years of church, I still don't know what the fuck is going on.\n\nI'm tired of being the second child that is happy and creative and spontaneous and yay!!!!\n\nI'm tired of asking for help and never getting any\n\nI'm tired of lying to people\n\nI'm tired of being a waste of time and money\n\nI'm tired of being completely mediocre\n\nI'm so tired \n\nIt is now 1am and I'm going to do it in 3 hours. \n\ntime to write an unorganized essay for a suicide note.\n\nwould it be funny if i wrote it like how highschoolers write their essays? idk\n\nthanks for reading my rambling and my unorganized baby-babble\n\nedit: haha im still here. im still here. im still here.\n\ni spent all night last night trying to write a suicide note, trying to justify myself, trying to excuse myself from living. i wrote a crude one and posted it here before i started the one i meant for my parents and friends. i got three pages in and i fell asleep from exhausting myself mentally and physically. a dark, dreamless sleep that has left me contemplating this morning. i look down at my thighs and my wrists and wonder if dying is really what i want. i read the beginning of my note and pity the author. my sheets are bloody from my thighs and i know my mom can already only handle the smallest bit of blood before going queasy. \n\nam i going insane? i cant follow through on anything, and now i cant follow through on my own suicide attempt. i had it all planned out and scheduled so that i could finally have something that i scheduled correctly. now im 5 hours late to my own death.\n\ni read the comments in this post and I've spent the past 5 minutes trying to figure out a way to tell you I'm still here. i cant tell if what you all have said is something i should be grateful for or if i should despise you. i guess my answer will come in time. \n\nin the meantime, im still here and I still feel like shit. i felt like this kind of update is needed to this type of situation.",

    "title": "My Wife Attempted Suicide",
    "selftext": "Wednesday afternoon my wife took a massive amount of medication. She texted me a photo of two piles of pills and said \"Goodbye. I'm sorry.\" I was at my parents apartment in the same building as ours, so I ran to our apartment, but she locked me out. I beat on the door over and over yelling for her to open up, and when she finally did, she just stumbled across the floor and fell on her bed, gagging and crying. I called 911 and held her head up and tried to keep her awake. She was vomiting everywhere. The paramedics carried her out of the apartment and down to a stretcher and I sped to the ER right behind them. They gave me a number to call in the ER to get updates, and all they kept saying was that she was in very critical condition and they're doing their best to stabilize her. She was vomiting so much that they couldn't pump her stomach and had to put her on a ventilator. Hours went by that felt like days, and the Dr finally called and said that they stabilized her, she was on a ventilator, but with the amount of duloxetine she ingested there was a high chance that she'd either be \"brain dead\" or have brain damage. I fell apart. My dad was there to hold me up, but I felt all the wind leave my lungs. My dad took the phone and talked to the Dr some more and then he picked me up like I was a kid and got me out of there and into the car. He said there's nothing we can do here. She's in ICU, she's gonna pull through, but we're waiting on the CT scan. So he drove us home, I passed out on the couch and at 6am the nurse called to tell us they got her off the ventilator and the scan was negative for brain damage. I threw my clothes on and sped to the hospital and stayed there for 2 days until it was time for her psychological evaluation. They actually said she was of no harm to herself or others and that she didn't require inpatient treatment of any kind. They discharged her to go home. I was speechless. I called her psychiatrist and he was emphatic about her being admitted for psychiatric treatment. She refused and said she just wanted to go home. Now, we have 2 autistic children. I am on short term disability for a migraine that's been going since early May, every day, and I'm not responding to any treatment. My head's a 8/10 on the pain scale nearly every day. I'm seeing a neurologist tomorrow, finally, but I've been at home on bed rest since May 17th with an ice bag on my head. Times are really tough. But now they want her to go home and for me to keep a \"suicide watch\" on her, to keep pills and sharp objects out of her reach. To find her outpatient therapy. To follow up with her psychiatrist and PCP. I can barely make myself a sandwich right now. So we brought her back home and the universe came calling. It was her psychiatrist who she's been seeing for 17 years. He said that if she doesn't follow his medical advice and admit herself to a mental health hospital, then he had no other recourse than to drop her as a patient. At that point, she got up, started getting herself together and said ok find me somewhere to go. I got her admitted to a reputable hospital that her psychiatrist recommended and I haven't heard from her since. I'm lost. I'm stuck between falling apart and angrier than I've ever been in my entire life. And my head is banging...just pounding. I asked my parents to take the kids until this blows over, and all I've been doing is crying, then I stop and get so mad...just furious. Then I break down again. I talked to my therapist and my spiritual advisor and they both helped a lot. But I'm so, so broken. I'm so confused. What did I do to make this happen? I just cry myself to sleep wondering what she's doing and what I'm going to when she comes home. I've never been so scared of something in my life. What if she does this again? What about the kids? They're autistic, they don't understand the complexity of what's going down. What if they find something really wrong with my brain? I feel like I'm standing at the edge of a cliff in the middle of a wind storm, trying to keep my balance, trying to be strong, but knowing that sooner or later I'm going to fall. And everyone is depending on me. And for whatever reason, my wife, my best friend, the mother of my kids, after 14 years together just said \"Goodbye. I'm sorry.\" Where the hell do we even go from here?",

I feel like I am going through the motions, just waiting to die... and it's going to be a long wait. I have been in therapy for 10 years, and it's constantly like this. I wish euthanasia for mental illness were a thing.\n\nSee, there is nothing in this world that brings me joy. I do not have any hobbies, and I do not have a job. I am going to be evicted if I do not find something before May, and while I have been applying, I also don't see the point. I have this black-and-white image in my head-- like a flipbook-- of me going through the motions until I am older enough to retire. I think I would rather cut to the chase because being alive hurts. There mornings where I wake up and take a handful of sleeping pills to make myself fall asleep again. That's really what I am doing... I am waiting to die.\n\nIt kind of feels good to type this out. I have not been out of my apartment for almost two weeks. It's almost like I've forgotten what the sound of my own voice sounds like. My boyfriend recently moved away, and we hardly talk anymore. My therapist dumped me (it's a long story + it was kinda my fault, so dont blame her), so I am without support (or structure). I do not have any friends. My family thinks I am being a drama queen and won't \"play\" this game with me anymore. If I were to kill myself tonight, I wonder how long it would take the world to notice. I imagine it would take a while unless my decomposing body starts to smell and a neighbor complains.\n\nI have prescriptions for a whole cocktail of drugs, but I am not 100% certain that an overdose would be successful. I'm 80% sure since I have stimulants and relaxants and sedatives and with some alcohol-- I don't drink, so I image I don't have a lot of tolerance-- it almost feels like I can pull it off. My biggest fear is failing. I am afraid I will only have a seizure and then have to deal with the aftermath of my suicide attempt. God, I don't want to spend more time in a psych ward. \n",

This was way harder than doing it before, i was almost having flashbacks. I got the pills in my mouth then got scared and went back to google to see if i knew how much it took before the seizures start, if they were painful, and the likelihood of slipping into a coma. i then looked up the most successful suicide attempts and pills were ranked at the lowest. then i started reading your comments about how it wouldn't kill me but make me violently sick. i have a very high pain tolerance but the last overdose was my first 10 pain until i caught covid.

I go through entire days at the university without even opening my mouth once, as I don't dare to approach another person. I can't even look at people; I make A LOT of effort to keep my eyes from glancing at anyone due to irrational fear. I've always been worry of people; I am so ridiculously shy and socially anxious.

I'm going to cover my face with a thick jacket. When I cover my face with it, I run out of air. My breathing is already short, so when I cover my face with this jacket it will be the end. \n\nIdk how to begin my story, but I guess I should say that I love life, or better yet, I loved life. I loved one that was fulfilling, I went to casinos, I did cocaine, I drank until I past out on the spot. I've met so many people in my life; you couldn't imagine the amount of stories I've heard, seen, and felt. \n\nI came to the realisation that life, life is boring. There is no point to any of this. I came to the realisation that the point of life, is finding a point. There is no point, it's simply how bad you try to delude yourself that there is a point.\n\nI'm going to end it all very soon so I dont mind saying my reasoning.\n\nI hope reincarnation is real\n\nWhen I tried it last time, there was buzzing that wouldn't leave me, but I tried pushing past that point. My whole idea or principle if you will, is that, if there is a higher power, and I end up in a long line, waiting to drink meng POS soup, then I've won. If I haven't, then I've also won, this is the end; even if I was wrong, I will still be \"alive', my body will be returned to the earth and the nutrients my ashes or body provides will supplement new life. In essence, I never really died.\n\nYou can think of the grass near my grave as me. I don't wish for a funeral but atleast give place my ashes beneath the soil. I don't want to be lying in an irn jn your living room. \n\nI love my family but spent too much time in my life being lazy, I read too many fantasy novels, and later on I dreamed too many dreams that couldn't exist within this realm.\n\nMy belief is that this isnt the end. My belief, is that once I pass out, I will be reborn and underworld and I will suffer for my sins, after suffering and serving my sentence, I will be given the choice to either drink meng Po's soup, or erase my memories. I will drink the soup and live the life that samsara has granted me\n\n\n\n\nI have about 20 minute untill I cover my face, so if u wanna talk, I can just about type but I might use voice recording, I can reply.

    "selftext": "I'm Thirty-seven. I have autism the supposed high functioning kind but that's a load of shit. There is no such thing. There's fucked and slightly less fucked.\n\nThe cherry on top? It was preventable. My 'wonderful' mother couldn't stop puffing her cancer sticks for nine months. So I get a lifetime subscription to the shit show that is my brain.\n\nIt gets better though. In gradeschool I was abused. My lovely aunt and grandmother buried it because , I don't know. Reasons. This escalated my behavioral issues in school and at home immensely. Rage doesn't even begin to describe it.\n\n.\n\nSchool was boring as hell. I had autisim I wasn't retarded. But the lovely school system couldn't tell the difference. So I was stuck in Special Ed, not being challenged at all. By all rights I should've been three grades above where I was. Public schools like uniformity. Different is anathema to them.\n\nSo my second year of middle school I said fuck it and quit going. I wasn't getting anything out of it anyway. Contrary to what most adults and parents think...you can't make a child do anything they don't want to do. They tried to make me go back. I refused. When my father hit me with the belt I called the police on him.\n\nIt was the last time that ever happened.\n\nAt fifteen or sixteen I got my highschool deploma from a by mail school. Mostly out of spite. It was a waste of time and money.\n\nMy general anexity and inability to be what society deems normal kept me from getting a job. Well almost.\n\nI worked for the family construction business starting at age 15 to 21 where I had wrecked my back. 0/10. Would not recommend. Money was great however it destroyed my developing body. I suffer from chromic pain now. Which on good days can be described as an icepick twisting in my hip and a baseball bat smashing into my back...and on bad sees me unable to walk from my bedroom to the bathroom without suffering from muscle spasms.\n\nI digress.\n\nAt twenty-five(I think)  I moved across the entire US to get away from them. With my then girlfriend/fiance. In retrospect it was a doomed relationship. While I cared for her my desire to get away from my family mattered more. I had grown to hate them.\n\nI had to come home two years later due to irreconcilable differences. I left again a short time later to be with another girl. At age thirty no less. I've been with this one since. If not for the disability laws we'd be married now.\n\nMy life had finally come together. We moved back to help tend to my ailing father. Stage four cancer. It was in 'remission'. or supressed. Whatever they do to keep it undercontrol.\n\nI was healthier. Until I was forced to deal with my toxic wastedump of a family again.\n\nMy mother hated my 'wife' and mother inlaw. She resented me for not being there to help with my father. (Yeah fuck you too bitch.) When he first took ill. Mm. She made no secret of that in how she treated me.\n\nIn the amidst of all that my grandmother, one who helped raise me...and also swept the abuse under the rug. Died.\n\nWhen I finally confronted my mother and aunt...my aunt claimed no such thing ever happened to me. So the options are casual indifference or malicious stupidity. The rage I had came back two fold.\n\nLuckily I lived across town. I could be there for my dad...help get him to this appointments and visit...yet I was isolated enough that I didn't have to deal with the excess family shit I tried to escape.\n\nUntil 2020.\n\nIn this godawful hellscape of a year... I lost my uncle in july. He was one of two male rolemodels I had. He helped instill morals in me and helped raise me.\n\nI lost my house(A rental), because the phrase 'caregiver' went in one ear and out the other. My priority was my dad. So sometimes the lawn wouldn't be cut as often as they would like. Or sometimes the house wouldn't be as clean. Sorry I have priorities. The shitbag landlord told us the neighborhood was becoming gentrified and he wouldn't be renewing our lease at the end of the year.\n\nSo unpleasantly I had to move back home with my wife and mother in law. Where my mother finds fault in everything.\n\nLovely.\n\nA month after I move in my father dies.\n\nIts at this juncture I begin to despise pretty much everyone and everything. I could not, in my wildest dreams imagine life being this goddamned cruel. I thought I'd get another year with him. Instead I got a middle finger.\n\nA week or so before his birthday.\n\nThen the petty fights started over bullshit. They are too numerous to even bother recounting here. Everyday some minor drama.\n\nAs if that wasn't enough... One of the kittens I hand raised and tamed had to be put to sleep due to cancer. After I spent 350 dollars I didn't fucking have to try and save her life. It wasn't my cat though. It was my dads. So another kick in the nuts.\n\nThis has been my life for the last three months. One blow after another with selfish ignorant people who continue to be absolute douchebags. Fighting over inconsequential shit that no sane person would give a damn about.\n\nThe cat dying was the last straw for me. I went off my meds. I was tried of playing peace keeper or being 'the man of the house.'\n\nIf I'm going to be miserable, I'm going to be miserable. I'm not going to keep pumping chemical bullshit into me to give me an artificial happy only to have it destroyed by selfish ignorant fucks.\n\nTO make matters worse, the constant snark directed at my wife has her in such a state she doesn't want to do anything. So cleaning, the litterboxes all of it falls on me now. This enviroment is destroying  the one healthy relationship I have. I'm growing to hate her too.\n\nOh did I mention I'm a firearm owner? I had to stay away from them for years until I trusted myself enough to use them responsibly again. The entire experience has destroyed that. I can't even enjoy one of the few hobbies my dad and I shared.\n\nYears of healing unraveled in a few short months.\n\nI'm a prisoner inside my own mind(And home it feels like)  half the time and the other half Well....I'm getting yelled at for leaving to go buy mcdonals at 11 at night or treated like I'm still a child because apperently I'm supposed to ask permission before leaving.. HAHAHA No.\n\nI've just about had my fill of other peoples bullshit. Though don't mistake me. I'm far too spiteful to actively harm anyone but myself. See if I opt out of this, the people who did nothing but make me miserable will have the guilt of my suicide on their minds. That thought alone makes me smile.\n\nI find myself looking at my dad's 1911 which I carry everyday...wondering why I don't stick the thing in my mouth and pull the trigger.\n\nEven at my lowest I used to have reasons why I wouldn't. Now the reasons why I should vastly out weigh the reasons why I shouldn't.\n\nNow that I have the text here, looking at it... I suppose the only reason I haven't is I'm not convinced the damn thing would actually kill me. The way this shitfuck of a year has gone I'd survive and be wheelchair bound or more mentally damaged than I already am.  There's always the shotgun I suppose...but it doesn't have the same sense of poetic irony to it.\n\nSo yeah. Merry Christmas to me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thanks for the wholesome award. I legit laughed out loud. You're the best reddit! ",

    "selftext": "I’m using this to say exactly how I feel cause I know no one will see this. \n\nThe last time I was genuinely happy was when I was 5.. then my grandfather died. I was extremely close to him and after his death things just weren’t the same, fast forward to 7th grade my father whom I was never close to despite living in the same house decided to slowly leave his family for another family and left my mom and I alone, then my mother took him back which kissed me off and caused me to an angry child who didn’t trust anyone... which probably caused me to never have a real relationship cause I never feel good enough and I can never fully trust them. Anyways I was always socially awkward/ shy and didn’t have a lot of friends but I have 3 childhood best friends I can at least say I have but as we’ve gotten older and everyone is moving on with their lives I feel stuck. \n\nMy life began to really fall apart in the fall of 2017 ( my second year of college) when I began to rapidly lose the vision in my left eye due to a condition I have that I didn’t even know about until the year before but the doctors said I shouldn’t worry to much about it, due to the loss of my vision in that eye I had 2 eye surgeries to try and repair it but they didn’t work which shocked the doctors. I took a semester off of school to recover and came back in hopes to finish school, then in February of this year the vision in my right eye began to slowly go away. I had to quit my job and leave school and move back in with my parents to try to “ heal”..\n\nI eventually got a job ( which I hate with a passion) and became stuck... then I got into a car accident and totaled my car so now I’m carless. I want to go back to school and get a new car but I feel like what’s the point if I won’t be able to see in a few months, everyday when I wake up before I open my eyes I think “ am I going to be able to even see”. It sucks because surgery won’t work, I’ve tried the holistic approach too and I’m still just slowly losing my sight. I really took things like that for granted.  My parents put me in therapy and it has caused me to face things but with my looking at the bigger picture I’m like what’s really the point? \n\n\nI’ll have 3 days of me feeling like myself and”happy” then it’ll be weeks of me in a deep depression wanting to kill my self or hoping I’ll die. I told my mother I want to kill myself before I go completely blind because I couldn’t live like that ( respect to those that are blind and live cause y’all are strong.. even though y’all can’t see this) so I said I’m going to see how the rest of the year plays out cause I’m not going into 2020 like this, but it’s like when I try to get my shit together nothing goes right, I had my heart set out for this new job and everyone there was like you got the job, the supervisors liked you, the employees recommended you, etc... no call back ( I was supposed to get one yesterday if I got the job) that was my breaking point. \n\nThat job really was a push for me to keep going but now that I didn’t get it I feel stuck again, I feel like I sound stupid and dramatic and I know this is worded horribly but I guess I’m just writing my jumbled thoughts out. I’ve been looking up easy ways to kill myself but I’ve seen that there are none... if I had a gun I’d just shoot myself, I looked up ODing on pills but it’s hit or miss and the miss will fuck you up, I thought about hanging myself but I’m black and I’d feel weird idk lol, I think about driving into oncoming traffic and hoping I’ll die but I don’t want to total my dads car cause that’s his property, I thought about cutting myself but I’ve read that that’s a slow death. \n\nIt’s like why is it so hard to die when you want to but when life is going good then you get sick, or die, etc. I guess I sound like a bitch cause I want to die but I don’t want to feel any pain but I guess I’ll have to feel pain in the process cause afterwards they’ll be no more pain. There’s like so much going on in my head and so much to write but idek what to say tbh even though I already said a lot, all in all I’m just so tired. Tired of crying myself to sleep, crying to work, crying at work, crying alone at home, and crying myself to sleep. I’ve been trying to disconnect myself from people but it’s like I still crave human interaction that’s why I feel like a fraud cause I want to be alone but I don’t to feel alone. \n\nThis whole thing probably doesn’t even make any sense but I’m just writing out my thoughts. No one will see this anyways or even read all of this anyways. At first I was giving myself till the end of the year but now I’m just trying to find the best method to end it.",

    "selftext": "Not here to be talked out of it, just wanted to say something anonymously I guess. I just got dealt a shitty hand in life in a lot of ways. Sure not as shitty as some others have it, but it's all shitty. I was never meant to find someone to be happy with or anything like that, I was always meant to die alone. I tried to avoid it but by 30 it became clear the path I was going down.\n\nMore importantly, I just never was happy with myself or life in general. Losing loved ones, losing touch with friends and never making new ones, being bored with the work I chose but having no interest in going back to school. Life is just not worth it to me. Lots of suffering and sadness with not much upside. I said if I wasn't feeling better by 31 I'd end it, and here I am. I'll miss my family but I'm done \"being strong for others.\" Time to take care of myself.\n\nI chose a method that is very lethal and should go quick. Yeah I know \"you might screw up\" but oh well, that's a risk I'll take. Oh and I'm sure someone will show up to tell me I'll go to hell like they always do to people here, and yeah, I'm shaking in my boots ;) lol.\n\nHoly shit, 15 minutes now as I write this. I'm scared obviously but also excited. It'll finally be done.\n\nGood luck everyone no matter your situation, if you choose to keep going I hope you end up better than I did. Bye.",

This is the smearing shit, piss on everything, holes in walls, nonverbal, violent, destructive, and incompatible with any semblance of normal existence. He’s an adult now, 18 and strong. \n\nEvery single day is a nightmare. I spent the bulk of last week wishing I was dead. I started thinking things might be better for him and he might get help if I were gone.  \n\nI took a beating last Thursday that left me bloody and another Friday early morning that fucked me up pretty good. I decided next time I’d just let him finish me off. \n\nCatch you on the other side. Remember me when you see the news article, it’s just a matter of time.\n\nSidebar: I spent 48 hours in the hospital ER with him. They cannot find any crisis stabilization facility to accept him due to his level of need. They searched the surrounding states too and every single facility declined him.",

And then you get to do it again. \nIf that’s all there is, why even continue on.\nI’m never getting married or having kids, for personal reasons..So I don’t have a responsibility to continue on either, but I know I could never kill myself, which makes it even harder. I know there will be no relief for the pain I feel every god damn day. I’m jealous of everyone who is content living like a damn robot slaved to society doing the exact same thing everyday. I wish I could be happy doing that, but I just feel like I’m wasting my damn life away.",
