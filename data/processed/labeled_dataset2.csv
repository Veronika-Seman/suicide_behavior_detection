i should be allowed to say i want to die without people making it all about them. i should be able to vocalise my pain without everyone around me calling me ""selfish"" for not wanting to live on in absolute agony. suddenly, i'm the bad guy for not wanting to wake up crying every morning? i don't get it.

i personally believe it is selfish for others to want a suicidal person to live on. how fucking selfish do you have to be to see someone in an incredible amount of pain, and want them to live on. we don't even do this shit to animals, so why do we do it to humans?

i went from being in a fantastic mood to really frustrated and struggling with a ton of self doubt.

luckily i was able to calm down over the weekend, but this morning my body went into anxiety attack mode on the way to work and i had to turn around.  

i have a long history of low self esteem and i have tried to work really hard on that.  the incident at work was all negative, and i work really hard at my job, so it was frustrating to take all the negatives and my self doubt really came back.  i was able to cry and let a ton of emotion out.

in the past i drank extremely heavily and used other substances to numb everything, that only made things a million times worse.  i'm trying to work through everything and not go down that path.

sometimes its a constant back and forth and i know i'm really good at my job, but then i have times where the negative past comes creeping back in, and that's tough to handle.

post_00977,"mental illness and too much stress - i want to kill myself hi everyone,

i've had really bad experience with reddit since it feels like whenever you aren't asking something very obvious and actually talk about your unique experience you get downvoted into oblivion, but nevertheless i'll try to explain my situation as honestly as possible so strangers on reddit might be able to help me.

i don't want to sound like a pretentious prick, but i actually think most would consider me in a good position in life - at least that's what everyone tells me. i'm young (16m) and have a bright future to look forward to. i have high grades (a+s consistently), a good sense of direction and maturity/responsibility, and i'm fairly socially vibrant. i also have a good career basically lined up with a full-time job offer in my country's federal government (originally an unpaid co-op/internship i did last year in 2024 but i have an offer to begin working in the spring when i'm wrapped up a few classes), and i'm graduating this year and will start university at 16 (i'm on track to getting my law license at 21 at this rate). i also work a decent part time job at a tutoring centre and i have a few (not many) friends i can occasionally fall back on.

however for the past few months i've been grossly unhappy to the point of being psychiatrically hospitalized with frequent contemplations of suicide. the counsellors and teachers i've spoken to have tried to convince me that stress is the root cause and i should simply scale back - what they don't know is that'd cause me way more trouble since i honestly generally find comfort in work. also trying to scale back at something which i've worked so hard to build and create would honestly be more disheartening. i do really think stress is a big factor but it's not like taking away the things i've worked so hard for is going to make me any more happier. 

for as long as i can remember i've struggled a lot with overthinking and anxiety yet i find nobody is taking me seriously whenever i try to seek help. whether it was writing homework or checking the door - i always double, tripled checked everything. somehow i've been able to get along fine in my life without it. however to be honest i've had instances of severe bouts of anxiety, depression, and paranoia. when i was 11 or 12 i freaked out after finding out a rare instance of canadian law which could make some of my favorite animes illegal (i thought i could have my life or my family's life could be ruined for child pornography possesion). when i was 13 i had a friend who expressed to me distressing thoughts and i freaked out thinking that something could happen with this guy and to me/family. today i constantly compare myself to others even to the point of irrationaility. for example, i frequently feel ashamed of myself and my achievements thinking everyone else is better than me - most of the time because they are 1 year older/ahead of me. even when i know they are older, i still second guess and start asking questions/googling around to the point that a lot of people think i'm a maniac. i've tried to tell myself i'm doing good and not to compare myself to others, but it's no use and i'm still losing my mind. recently i've been finding that it's been increasingly increasingly difficult for me to focus and do my work, and i might finish one class with a failing mark. a lot of people say i'm being burnt out and while that might be one facet of it, i don't believe it's the entire story and i don't know how to help myself.

post_01259,"wondering if i did the right thing today i‚Äôve been suicidal for most of my life, but in the past several months it has been intensifying. today, i told my endocrinologist, who i trust, that i was suicidal and had been considering a method for it. well, it was more like i unraveled in front of her as she coaxed the answers out of me, but whatever.

she walked with me to the er (which meant a lot even if she was just doing her job). i was only there for about 4 hours. i may have downplayed the severity of my ideation out of fear of being admitted. the psychiatrist determined that i did not need to be forced to be hospitalized but could choose to if i felt it was needed. i said no, though now i‚Äôm wondering if i should‚Äôve said yes. i was discharged with mental health resources.

one part of my mind is gently telling me that i did the right thing, that i can use those resources to get better, but the other part is so loud. it is screaming that i fucked up, that it‚Äôs pointless and i will end up killing myself anyway because i didn‚Äôt tell the whole truth, that i don‚Äôt deserve help.

post_05715,"life happened yet again i am going through an extremely tough time. i was diagnosed with cancer some months ago, had a surgery and now have a couple of days before the next stage of treatment starts -- including the most dreaded part -- chemotherapy. my life has been chaotic since the diagnosis, to say the least. simultaneously, i had been giving job interviews, phd interviews, and trying to manage many other things in my life. i actually gave a job interview in the same week as my surgery, and i wondered at the same time where do i get this courage from -- if it was courage. kudos to me?!

all in all, i just needed a space to dole out my feelings as i am too overwhelmed right now. psychology sessions can only help to some extent and the efforts have to be majorly my own to overcome, heal, and bounce back.

post_01766,"wife cheated update edit: so i've been getting a lot of dm's asking how i caught her etc and what i did. so i came back from a late night jog as i find it peaceful and relaxing as the streets are empty, i came back home to have a shower of course as i was sweaty as fuck. i entered the apartment and just headed to the bedroom and there is where i saw her with another man in bed. my god damn silk sheets tainted by them üòîüòÇ, but yeah it's weird cause i thought i would lash out but i was unusually calm about it. i told the guy to leave and he was literally shitting himself and scrambling to pick up his belongings, like this guy is literally tripping everywhere. 

i think he was afraid as i was just very calm and he didn't expect it. anyway i spoke to my wife asking how long it's been happening and she told me who he is etc, it's a childhood ""friend"". after that i went to the train station which is where the first post came in.

edit 2: people are also asking how long we were together. so i met my loyal and faithful wife at 14 and we got married at 20. so in total that's 12 years of faithfulness from the amazing wife. 

edit 3: holy shit whoever gave the platinum thanks so much???

edit 4: people are surprised that i'm over this so quick and i'm calm about it, i guess it's down to the fact i live by the rule that is ""the pains compulsory, sufferings optional""

original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/suicidewatch/comments/gt620f/wife_cheated/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

so it's been about 10hours since i posted this and honestly thank you so much everyone for all the support and comments. 

i'm not going to lie when i posted the previous post i was at the train station just waiting to jump infront of one but as stupid as it sounds the comments honestly helped. 

i've now kicked my wife out of our apartment and the bed that she was sleeping with the guy in, i have now burnt. which kinda sucks as it was a king sized bed with silk sheets and everything but i wouldn't have even been able to sleep in those cheat stained sheets now no matter how much i scrub them. 

it felt good tho to actually burn it cause it was letting things go, i've cleared out all the things that reminded me off her and basically smashed it up so kinda like smash therapy and it felt amazing. 

her parents know that she cheated on me cause she tried to spin it that i cheated on her however we have cameras in our apartment and i just sent them the videos ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

now her family has pretty much disowned her which i feel like it may be a bit too much even though she is a shitty person but honestly i couldn't care less.

i'm free, feeling a bit shit but i know i'll be happier and honestly if it wasn't for you guys i probably wouldn't be here.

i don‚Äôt see it this way‚Ä¶yes, i will bring up things that make me unhappy. but these things never change so i feel the need to bring it up time and time again. 

my issues are:
- the amount of time he spends gaming (currently 6ths a day on weekdays and 12 hours a day on weekends)
- lack of quality time together (he thinks me sitting beside him whilst he games is quality time) 
- lack of intimacy 

last night he screamed in my face. he said the reason he doesn‚Äôt do the things i ask is because i‚Äôm constantly around and don‚Äôt work (my dad passed away recently so i‚Äôm currently off sick from work). he said my life revolves around him and the relationship and he feels he can‚Äôt escape. he called it suffocating. 

i agree that i am always on his back‚Ä¶but it‚Äôs only so he‚Äôll do the things i know he‚Äôs capable of. the things that made me soo attracted to him and that made me want him as my boyfriend. 

my boyfriend said he loves me and doesn‚Äôt want to end our relationship at all but he‚Äôs really struggling with feeling like nothing he does is good enough. he said gaming is a stress reliever and when he goes to game, he knows he won‚Äôt get moaned at üò©

so, my question is‚Ä¶ how do i stop behaving like a nag but still get what i want in the relationship? my current tactic is giving him loads of space and making plans to get out the house everyday. i‚Äôm also planning to go back to work early. 

what else can i do? neither of us want to break up. we just want to be in a good place. ",0

recently, i fell in love with an anime character (ichika nakano, from quintessential quintuplets if you're curious). i imagine her with me when i'm alone, hugging me, comforting me with sweet words, telling me that everything will be fine. i want her to be real, not just a part of my imagination. i want to be able to hug her back.

i feel like i will never meet someone like her in real life. i got rejected 3 times when i was younger, and i know it's entirely my fault, because i'm a wierd guy and i don't know how to handle a proper conversation. i've given up on fiding love one day. the only person in my life now is ichika.

so, maybe, if i die, maybe i will be able to join her in another world, a world where we could live happily together. i know it sounds so fucking stupid. i don't see the point on living on anyways, because i'm never going to find someone like her.

post_07313,"sinking in the abyss of loneliness lately, every breath feels heavier than the last. the weight of my loneliness crushes me down, deeper and deeper into the darkness. it's like i'm suffocating in a room full of people, each lost in their own world, unaware of the storm raging inside me.  i try to smile, to make small talk, to act like everything is okay, but inside, i'm screaming for someone to see through the facade. i long for a connection that feels genuine, a hand reaching out in the midst of this ocean of emptiness.  the nights are the worst. the silence echoes my thoughts, amplifying the ache in my chest. it's in those quiet moments that the thoughts of ending it all become the loudest. the idea of escaping this endless cycle of numbness starts to feel like the only way out.  i wish i could make sense of this pain, find a reason to keep going. but it feels like i'm running on fumes, dragging myself through each day with a heart weighed down by sorrow. the thought of not waking up tomorrow becomes a tempting respite from this unbearable existence.",1

post_07140,"lost in the shadows of my own mind lately, every passing moment seems to whisper the same haunting question - when will it all end? the weight of the world on my shoulders feels unbearable, suffocating. i find myself walking through each day as if i'm merely a ghost, a shell of who i used to be.  the relentless pain in my heart echoes louder than any voice around me. it's a symphony of sorrow that plays on repeat, drowning out any semblance of hope. the desire to end it all, to embrace the darkness, creeps into my thoughts like a familiar shadow.  i've tried to reach out, to seek solace in the arms of others, but the emptiness within me remains untouched. the words of reassurance feel hollow, incapable of mending the shattered pieces of my soul. i feel lost in a maze with no way out, trapped in a cycle of despair.  in moments of silence, the idea of escape dances seductively in my mind. the allure of a final farewell, a permanent solution to temporary pain, grows stronger with each passing day. i wonder if there is a right time, a perfect moment to bid farewell to this cruel world.  i long for peace, for serenity amidst the chaos that engulfs me. but as i stand at the crossroads of existence and oblivion, i can't help but wonder - is there still a glimmer of light in this endless night?",1

post_05043,"i feel like i'm losing my mind over money and i don't know what to do throwaway account btw

i currently live in a $2500 a month house. legally it's technically only two bedrooms since this is texas and there's only closets in two of the rooms.however we call it a 4 bedroom house, there's 3 full bathrooms (although one only has a shower which sucks because i prefer baths due to chronic but as of yet undiagnosed pain) and we live walking distance from a lake, with a nice sized back yard.

however the house is made out of the cheapest everything possible, i have mold in my toilet room (?) from the steam of my shower which has paint actively bubbling off around the showerhead, the doors aren't properly sealed and bugs can get in so easily which is super awesome for someone with arachnophobia lemme tell you. 

it's so much but i can't afford to move and honestly, in all my life and even my mom's life this is the best landlord we've ever had. it didn't start this expensive but we've lived here for almost 5 years now and there's not much we can do to move, atp between my partner and i having to pay so much (not including everything else) it's stressing us both out to the point were he has a manic episode and i am having mental health struggles again and i'm trying so hard but god i'm exhausted (not suicidal though, i'm working very hard to not have those thoughts) 

for context my mom lost her job where she was paying the majority of the rent 2 years ago, got another one a year later only to be let go because she wasn't meeting sales expectations (they wanted her to 30 packs of some cure all juice at costco and she averaged 28 literally) so she was doing instacart whole looking and only just last month finally got a job but it's on fast food and she's only making like 13 something an hour 3 or 4 days a week. ironically my partner and i also work for the same company but he's a manager and i'm a floor lead he gets like 20 something and i get about 17 something. 

on top of that i transferred to a new store and the boss there is so horrible that it makes me want to quit the company i've been with these past 3 years because holy fuck she's evil, not too mention i'm supposed to work 10 to 6, 4 days a week. yet since i transferred in late november i've gotten off at 6 twice, which would be fine if i hadn't stayed until 10 on 3 separate occasions, regularly have someone that's late to relieve me making my fall behind on my tasks (they're supposed to get there at 5 so i can finish my stuff) and are writing up my employees for stuff i don't know about and am not told about (although my employees haven't signed anything so i don't think it holds any legal weight) and thus cannot fix and now we're ""letting them go"" because of ""attitude problems"" these employees are black men and my partner has pointed out that it feels like racism but i'm not sure myself since i'm autistic. 

i'm somehow getting 47 hours a week give it take and it's killing me, i'm coming home and sleeping, i get off work and can't stand straight for an hour, the thought of walking up the stairs to my room makes me want to sob from exhaustion and every day i'm closer and closer to crying at work because of the stress. 

i can't afford this house but if i leave i have to pay 5k (the landlord is a sweetheart so he only wanted two months rent to break the lease instead of however much 2500 between now and april 2026 would be) or get evicted but that'll fuck over me and my mom and then we'll have to find a place for me, my mom, my baby sister, my partner, 2 or 3  dog's, possibly also my little sister who's 18 one of the dogs is hers and she can probably take him and move in with her partner but maybe not idk and it's driving me insane

i'm having so much anxiety my add meds aren't working and to top it all off i don't think i have add i think i have adhd and i'm just good at masking but i don't how to bring that up to my doctor that i really can't afford to see plus i had some random 3 month long stomach pains which set us back so much my partner and i no longer have savings

and we think i have pcos but the test my doctor told me about is super scary and invasive and i can't afford to see a doctor for it regardless of all that and i just need help in literally any financial way but i have literally no one in my life that i can ask and it's stressing me out because i can't talk about all this to my partner because i didn't want to trigger his issues since he's also going through it and i'm worried about him... 

sorry for the long post i'm just so stressed out i really needed to get that all off my chest ",0

post_06682,"two women changed my life and they don't even know i exist these two ladies profoundly impacted my life and i will never be able to thank them personally, so i will do it here.

first, to the random teenage girl on the train:

you were talking with your friend. she seemed really depressed because she could not get a boyfriend. i was half listening to the conversation while dozing off and heard you say:

""why do you want a boyfriend so much? what do you think will change in your life after getting a boyfriend?""

that woke me up. at the time, i was obsessing over getting a particular ""dream job"". i was depressed and anxious about it, i was crying over it. i was feeling like such a failure. it was all i could think or talk (and complain) about.

as soon as i got home, i made a list: ""things that i think will change if i get my dream job"".

it ended up being such a long list. i was basically blaming all of life's problems, big and small on not having this particular job. not only that, but i was also putting things ""on hold""' until after i got this job for no good reason. like i needed a particular job title to join a gym or practice my hobby.

so i took that list and started doing everything i wrote down. i started addressing the problems directly and finding outlets for the things i was not satisfied with. i still wanted the job, but my happiness did not depend on it. since then, when i find myself obsessing over a particular thing, i always take the time to think if i'm using it as an excuse to not work on other problems i might have.

thank you, teenage girl on the train. you were trying to help your friend and changed a stranger's life instead.

second, to the woman that lives in an apartment somewhere above me:

you moved to the building shortly after i did. i heard some people move what sounded like a very heavy object up the stairs and you thanking them with such happiness in your voice. and then i heard music. you almost didn't wait for the movers to leave before you started playing that piano. and you kept playing. every day.

every day i heard the piano and i remember thinking ""she plays beautifully, i wish i was that good at my hobby"". and then i felt like an idiot. because i was hearing you play every day while i was wasting time online. so i closed my laptop and got practicing.

i'm trying to build that habit now. sometimes it's hard to find that motivation, sometimes i forget. but every day i hear you play, and every time i stop what i'm doing and practice for a little bit. i'm still not great, but i'm getting better.

thank you, lady who lives in my building. you are just practicing a skill you enjoy and you inspired a stranger to do the same.",0

post_05699,"you want to be loved and i want so badly to tell you that you already are, but i never can. the past few months have been excruciating. you're lonely and broken and want love more than anything. unfortunately for me, i love you. maybe we could heal each other, maybe i'm not delusional. but it doesn't matter, because i can never tell you anyway.

it's hopelessly tragic and very cliche, i'm afraid. you're just the most magical thing i have ever seen. i remember the first time we met, me so nervous and entranced, and you caring nothing about me. i doubt you even remember, and that doesn't hurt my feelings. i'm unremarkable, especially when in your shadow.

but i saw your darkness and i saw your pain, mirroring my own back to me in a way that made me feel both comforted and intrigued. nobody else has ever made me feel quite that way, and i know nobody else ever will. you are cosmic, untethered, a wild sprite that i could never hold in my hands but would settle to gaze at from afar with admiration. i wanted to know everything about you. i still do.

but that's not what happened. i kept pushing for a connection. so we talked. then we laughed. then by some twist we became friends and the infatuation turned real, evidenced by how truly perfect i learned you are. 

i wish i never knew. if you had stayed a figment in my mind - only an echo of the possibility of us both being loved, truly seen, being able to hold you and be held by you - maybe i could have moved on. would have settled for that, but then my hands grazed  yours. our knees knocked against each other underneath the bar. you told me your fears of being alone forever, unloved and unseen. i sat silently screaming how much i loved you into the void between our minds, willing the message to somehow find you. maybe it did and you didn't want to hear it, so it floated away like a whisper without a second thought.

i play conversations in my head of how things would go, how you'd react if i told you the truth - that i'm in love with you. the fear of losing your friendship will keep my secret. if you can't love me, i can still love you from right here.",0

post_04525,"who else has anxiety about not doing enough with their life? to give a brief backstory, i graduated college in spring 2017 and was still working as a barista at starbucks. about two months after graduation i started to really feel the effects of my anxiety. i was panicking that i didn‚Äôt already have a better job and that i was gonna lose my apartment because i couldn‚Äôt pay bills. after relentlessly searching until february 2018, i found a job as a sales rep at a cell phone store. since february, i‚Äôve been doing great! i‚Äôll be making about $40k a year and after five years of struggling with bills, i can comfortably afford my apartment!

now, since about april, i‚Äôve been having anxiety, again, about me feeling like i‚Äôm not doing enough. i‚Äôve been relaxing a lot, going out to places with friends (because now i can afford it,) and playing a lot of video games(it‚Äôs always been a hobby.)  but i‚Äôm feeling pressure to go back and get a masters in the hopes of finding a better job and really going for something that i actually dreamed of doing. i just can‚Äôt find the will to break away from this relaxed mood the change in pay has given me. every time i try to give up playing video games and going out with people, in hopes of working towards something, i go right back into this comfortable routine.

post_03629,"i really want to finish college but i don‚Äôt know how i‚Äôll be able to do it‚Ä¶the anxiety is only getting worse this is supposed to be my last semester in college. i‚Äôve been working at it for over 6 years. this is my final class. 

i went through a really tough semester. my anxiety got the better of me and took away a lot of my concentration. i talked to my professor and she was incredibly understanding; she gave me a second chance, and allowed me to take an incomplete to finish the work. 

this was back in december; it is now february, and i haven‚Äôt done any of the required work: four homework assignments and two 1500-word essays. each assignment requires that you watch a movie and read a chapter from our book. the assignments are all due by the first of march, and i feel like time is running out. although my professor has tried to be very encouraging and supportive (she even essentially said to me ‚Äúas long as you do the work the best you can, and hand everything in on time, you‚Äôll pass and graduate‚Äù) i feel like i‚Äôm still going to fail. i feel like the work i‚Äôll do won‚Äôt be good enough. 

i wake up every morning with my heart racing and this overwhelming feeling of dread. if i fail, i won‚Äôt graduate this semester. my dad paid for this course. my parents don‚Äôt have faith in me that i‚Äôll even finish. if i fail, i‚Äôll prove them right, i won‚Äôt graduate this year, and i‚Äôll likely get no more funding from them towards my education; i‚Äôd have to pay out-of-pocket for another class. my gpa is already low (a 3.17) and i worry that failing will put me on academic probation at my school. 

so much is riding on how i do in these next few weeks. i don‚Äôt know why i can‚Äôt just sit down and do these assignments already. i had so much time, and now time is running out. i‚Äôm not getting restful sleep; i‚Äôm barely eating. i‚Äôm not taking care of myself, and having frequent meltdowns. i go to therapy and take meds but they‚Äôre not doing enough. i feel this immense guilt, pressure, and sense of urgency to do the work, but the thought of going on my computer to do this work is paralyzing. i want it to be *perfect*; i‚Äôve had issues with procrastination and perfectionism my entire college career, and now i might completely squander it. i don‚Äôt want to disappoint my parents. i don‚Äôt want to disappoint my professor. i don‚Äôt want to mess this up.

post_06739,"update: i am battling cancer. i'm gay, but i have realized i love my best friend of 25 years (a man). i told him everything and it was the best day of my life. thank you all. if you want the original story, it has a similar title. here is my update. so tonight i told james. i told him everything. gosh. i just wish i could relive this night over and over again. i've never been so happy.  


he came into my room this evening like he always does. greeted me, ""hello, how's my amumu doing today"". i told him i was doing well. he told me i looked beautiful. which is not true but it still felt so sincere. then he started unpacking the stuff he brought me today. i asked him to stop and just come sit with me because i wanted to talk to him. he nodded and came and sat down next to me.""what's up?"" he asked.  


it took me a bit to gather myself. i kept getting distracted by his eyes. how he looks at me sometimes, i don't know how to describe it. i told him ""i love you."" and he just kind of laughed and touched my hand before casually responding  ""oh i know that, i love you too."" in retrospect this wasn't the best way to start i guess since we've said that enough with a different understanding that he didn't get what was happening. he started to get up again to unpack the snacks and i grabbed his arm and asked him to let me finish. he looked confused but he nodded and sat back down.  


and then i did it. i told him everything. i told him about all the times in the past i'd thought about just marrying him despite my sexuality. i told him my favorite memories of him and how they make me feel. i told him he'd always been my best friend and the person i trusted the most. i told him i made a mistake and i should've chosen him. i then basically devolved into reciting the last paragraph of my first post to him -- he's the face i see when i think about feeling loved, the embrace i feel when i think about being safe, it doesn't matter what we do -- if we're together i'm happy and he's the only thing i want for the rest of my life.  


he basically froze. he said nothing -- just looked at me as i spilled everything. i am not sure he even blinked. when i finished and looked up at him he was sitting there like a statue with his mouth slightly open, still enough it was like he forgot to breathe. james always knows what to say so this was a little unnerving to me.  


i started to ask him if everything was alright but before i could finish his expression broke. he exhaled into a weak but incredibly tender, quivering smile, and he just reached out  and pulled me into a hug. i buried my head in his chest and his arms just wrapped around me. i just melted into him. he was so gentle. it felt so easy. it felt so right. then he started crying, and then i started crying. he's been coming here through 2 years of cancer treatment and never seen him cry til now. he held me for a while but however long it was it wasn't long enough. he still hadn't actually said a single word since i finished talking but i guess he didn't really need to‚Ä¶ then he finally answered my question with: ""now it is"".  


when he finally pulled away, his face was red from crying but he just looked so happy. he looked at me for a bit. it was kinda cute because he had a little trouble maintaining eye contact, which he usually doesn't. he was like a little boy again. then he finally looked right at me and  he just said ""you are the only thing i've ever wanted."" then i started crying again and he started crying again and he pulled me to him and held me again. i wish it never ended.  


a little bit later once we exhausted our crying capacity, i showed him the post. he made a few jokes about wanting to meet this ""james guy"" and about how he had better go and thank my mom for her 20 year wingwomanship lol. then after he finished reading it he kissed me. it felt easy, not scary at all and just‚Ä¶ right. he asked me if it lived up to my daydreams and i chuckled and said yes. then he said ""i'm not so sure myself, i think i need more data"" and kissed me again (he is so ridiculous but this was smooth as butter).  


then after that we started talking, and i guess he told me everything too. he said he'd loved me since we were little kids. told me he still has every drawing/letter/kraft i ever made for him in a safe that he took with him to college and has taken everywhere he's ever lived. we talked about the day i came out as gay to him, and how he'd figured it out earlier -- but he struggled to accept it for months in secret because he had lived his entire life up to that point assuming we would be a family and wanting nothing else.  he told me he thought about our last night before college all the time and he kept hoping that entire night i'd say something before he left, because then he'd have transferred colleges to stay with me. told me he actually took a very long way home just to prolong the time when we were holding hands and i was sleeping on his shoulder and that it was to this day his favorite memory.  


then he looked at me with those piercing green eyes and said ""for me‚Ä¶ there has never been anyone else.""  he loved once (me) and then struggled through a bunch of rebounds and even though he had learned to bury it and move on with life and was happy in our friendship his heart had only ever belonged to me. honestly i guess i should've known this (my dad told me he was sure this was true before but i didn't listen) but i was flustered (and deeply moved).  i joked that he should enter the olympics as a torch carrier and he said ""they'd never have a chance i'm the greatest there ever was."" awww.  


we sat and talked and reminisced some more, mostly about when we were kids. i found out some things i never knew because he avoided telling me how romantic somethings were for him after i came out, but i also kinda realized‚Ä¶ i think they felt romantic to me too. then he sang me some of ""our songs"" (his voice is so beautiful). we had another embrace and another kiss. both still felt divine. i can't wait to have my hair back again so he can pet it like he used to when we were kids.  


then i brought up the sex question, and omg it was the cutest shit ever. i barely got to say anything before he started tripping over himself like ""look, i don't even care -- i don't need that, if we need mistresses or something we can do that it doesn't bother me, i just want to wake up with you every day."" which was sweet, but then i told him that even though i didn't know how that would go (and i might not be able to) i wanted to try with him anyway when i got better -- and oh my god he turned tomato red and could barely look at me. literally could not even manage to form a sentence in response -- just mumbled incoherently before managing to get out ""um, ok, if you're sure"". this man has been married and had 6 girlfriends but he completely just falls all over himself at the thought, god it was adorable. this is the only thing i'm still a little worried about, but i do want to try. i mean i liked the kissing which i thought was completely impossible. and i know that if it doesn't turn out well it won't ruin anything and we'll still be together and just figure something else out for that one need.  


then we talked about the cancer. he is so sure i'm gonna make it. it's so touching. it took a little while to get him to take the other possibility seriously. when i finally did and i told him that it's the reason i didn't tell him sooner, he held my hand and told me that if that happens -  he'd be ok because he'll always know that he was one of the lucky ones because he was mine. jesus fucking christ i almost lost it. then he said if we don't have that much time left, we better make sure every minute counts. i said ""that's pretty hard to do in a hospital"" and he replied ""what do you mean? we're both here and that makes this the best place on earth."" dear god, what did i do to deserve this man? i teared up again and he held me one last time. then the doctors came in. he kissed me goodnight. we both said i love you but it felt so different. it's never felt so good to say or hear those words. then he smiled at me and left.  


i was so excited the first thing i did was call mom and she was just ecstatic. i think she might be happier than me, which is saying something lol. as soon as i told her what happened and that james and i are together she just started crying and talking about what a good boy he is, how she just knew this would happen and that she can rest easy now because she knows i will always be loved and taken care of. plenty of her ""destiny"" talk which usually gets on my nerves but honestly i was so happy tonight, fuck it i'm on board. maybe it was destiny. i guess sometimes mom really does know best.  


i feel like a teenager again. i never thought i'd feel this way again in my life. i never even imagined if i did it would be for a man. god i love him so much. now i can't understand what i was ever worried about or why i didn't do this years ago. thanks so much to everyone who read my story and helped give me the perspective and courage i needed to finally do what i should've done years ago. now as long as my health cooperates‚Ä¶ i'll be one of the lucky ones too, because i am his.

edit: update: we broke up. it is taking everything within me not to crawl back to him. i feel alone and heartbroken.  i miss him. but you were all right - he was abusing me, and it wasn't going to stop anytime soon. no more excuses for him. without you all, i would have married this abusive boyfriend.",0
post_05547,"i love my husband but, i am starting to hate him. i (31f) have known my husband (30m)  half my life. we meet in 6th grade. he is my best friend. we were on and off through middle school and early adult years. i haven't always been the best person and honestly don't deserve how well he treats me despite all the shity things i have done. he never has thrown anything in my face and he knows all my deepest darkest secrets. we married because he joined the military and didn't want to leave everyone he cared about behind. i was the only person, who could pack up everything and go with him. i wanted to get away from my abusive parents. 
our marriage is amazing, no fights similar beiles and likes/dis likes . we have been married 12/20 years we have known each other. our relationship is great, except our sex life.
i am a hyper sexual person. i am the type of person who could do it everyday mutiple times a day. he is not and never has been. he would dirty talk and lead me to believe he that things would be a certain way between us. example we spent most of our sr year not dating but sexting and talking a out doi g stuff, usually started by him.  but the we were able to act on one of our text fantasies he acted like we wasn't interested. i was literally naked in front of an 18 year old boy alone with the possibility of doing anything he wanted. ( i was 18 myself) sadly this would become the reality of my relationship.  constantly disappointed and getting my hopes up for sex and not getting anything. 
he isn't messing with anyone else, and he isn't jerking off. i watch more porn then he does. he is doesn't have intrest. i have tried everything, he knows how i feel but puts no effort. he even offered to open our marriage so i can get the sex i want. which at this point i feel like isn't too much 2-3 times a week, instead of the once a week to every other week we are having. 
in the past i have seeked other partners but it always makes me feel guilty and horrible like i am the worse person in the world evem though he knows and has given permission. i want him to be fucking my brains out. 
sex with my husband is fucking amazing, he knows all the right spots,  he is the best sex ever. all this also messes with. mental health and self esteem  so even when i build up the courage to find a fuck buddy i just think of no one wanting me. he makes me feel wanted and loved in every way but fucking me. he is good about teasing me like grabbing my butt, and boobs. he randomly passionately kiss me he just never fucks me. and always been issues. it's not likecits an age thing. he was like this at 18=19 years old. i know some people are just like that. i respect that. but he won't compromise. i am the one giving up me. i have tried to end the marriage but he always guilts me and gets better for a few months then boom starts  back to sqaure one. we have brought $100's in toys to help him be interested. none of it helps. i am starting to hate him for the lack of sex. 
like one excuse he had was we lived with people. well we have had our own house for two years and no change. 
i don't want to hate him but i do a lot from time to time. and idk what to do anymore. i am tried of crying my self to sleep over not feeling wanted or sexy  
thanks for making it this far in the vent",0

post_05607,"i m30 want to end my engagement with f29 to preface, my fianc√©e is an incredible person and an amazing friend. she has a kind heart, and being with her has brought so many positive things into my life‚Äîan incredible friend group, deep connections with her cousins, and countless lessons that have helped me grow as a person.

but as a partner, she has fallen short. she is complacent and lacks ambition or drive to change her circumstances. she doesn‚Äôt have a driver‚Äôs license, didn‚Äôt finish school, and stayed in a job that caused strain in our relationship.

here‚Äôs the situation: after a rocky phase in our relationship, we had been dating for about five years and were finally doing better. i decided to start planning a proposal. at the time, there were still unresolved issues: we were barely having sex (maybe once every few months), she didn‚Äôt kiss me, and i was doing all of the cooking, cleaning, and chores. despite all of that, i thought that during the year i planned for the proposal, things would begin to improve. i wasn‚Äôt expecting perfection‚Äîjust effort and progress.

but nothing changed. yet, because her friends and cousins knew about the plans, and i had already invested in the ring and booked the venue, i went through with the proposal. to be fair, the engagement weekend was wonderful, and we even had sex, which felt like progress.

fast forward to now: it has been a year and a half since we got engaged, and nothing has improved. we haven‚Äôt had sex or even kissed since that initial engagement weekend. her parents don‚Äôt even know we‚Äôre engaged because they‚Äôre muslim, and only her dad knows i exist. there have been no wedding plans, no serious conversations about the future, and no noticeable effort on her part to address the issues i‚Äôve brought up multiple times.

for example, my birthday passed recently, and i asked for intimacy as a gift. she made an effort for the first time in ages, but we were late to dinner (because of her), and i was too stressed to enjoy it. later, i planned a romantic brunch cruise, and after some drinks, we tried again, but the lack of connection over the past year made the experience feel forced and uncomfortable.

i‚Äôve expressed my concerns and repeatedly told her that her complacency could lead to a breakup. i feel like i‚Äôve been taken for granted because i‚Äôve always been the reliable one. she seemed to stop prioritizing me after the engagement because she felt secure.

i love her deeply, but i don‚Äôt trust that we can fix this in time to build patterns that will last a lifetime. the fact that nothing changed after a year and a half of engagement is hard to overlook.

a few days ago, i told her i wanted to break up. i don‚Äôt want to give up on us, but i also don‚Äôt see how i can keep moving forward when i feel so unappreciated and unloved. walking away after 7.5 years feels impossible, especially since i‚Äôve invested so much‚Äîi converted to islam and spent two years learning her language to make this work.

how do you walk away from someone you love but feel so deeply taken for granted by? is there hope, or am i prolonging the inevitable? any advice would mean the world to me right now.",0

post_02874,"i have been unintentionally planning my perfect suicide and i can‚Äôt beat it. (lengthy post incoming) for months i have been on a turf that i‚Äôve never been on before. a few months ago my mind took a complete turnaround, and i think i committed to ending my life. 

all day long it‚Äôs detailed thoughts of what my last words will be, who they will be too, who am i leaving my possessions with, where i will be, what my last public words will be, what my last picture will be, what my last meal will be, essentially what my last day will look like. i haven‚Äôt nailed it yet, which is why i think i‚Äôm still here. i almost want it to be artistically perfect, and i have never been this detailed about anything in my life. i know that it‚Äôs coming, i fight it but i can‚Äôt stop it.

i haven‚Äôt always been like this. a year ago i felt on top of the world, i felt loved, i felt noticed and generally felt healthy. i know there‚Äôs people that love me, but feeling it has been long gone. 

there‚Äôs something wrong. i‚Äôve reached out, i‚Äôve tried different medication, i‚Äôve spoke with hotlines, i‚Äôve scheduled psychiatry/therapy but they keep canceling and pushing back weeks at a time, i hope to try it at least once before i take off. 

fighting it isn‚Äôt working. i think about running, moving far away with no word. just going missing i suppose, and maybe find myself and my happiness somewhere on my own. i don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs the answer, but last straw i might try it. 

i don‚Äôt necessarily want to die, but i feel i can‚Äôt live properly. i almost feel like i don‚Äôt know how to. i have social issues, can be pretty awkward at times. something made me feel like i don‚Äôt know how to talk to people, have a simple conversation or connections with people. i go out to the store or to work, and see people talking and smiling and just living, and it hurts because i want that, but i feel awkward talking. i feel judged every time i speak or make i contact, and i‚Äôve never felt that before.

ironically, i love myself. i feel i‚Äôm a very lovable person, but i feel so disconnected that i don‚Äôt think anyone else will ever feel that way about me. which breaks my heart. i feel i won‚Äôt live a proper life and i think that‚Äôs what‚Äôs gonna do it.

i don‚Äôt think anyone really knows, because i do have people in my life. i‚Äôm a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù person. but my mind took a complete turn and i hope to beat it.

post_06748,"my boyfriend died this morning. 
i keep crying in waves. it doesn‚Äôt feel real. i‚Äôm ready for the hospital to call and say he came back to life. it was a car accident. i was supposed to be with him. 

this man is my soulmate. there is nobody else like him. he is 28, his birthday is next week. i am 23. after i graduated last year we moved to 30+ beautiful acres in the south. we renovated a house together and had primary custody of his 4 year old daughter. my life is completely entangled with his. every stupid item in this stupid house is him. we were building an off-grid homestead, our dream. my parents are flying in tonight. it doesn‚Äôt feel real and i want to wake up. i will never forget his mom calling us and screaming he was dead. we were gonna start a business together, i wanted to have babies with him. he is the most amazing father, he did everything for her. we haven‚Äôt even lived here for a year. 

i used to see videos of other people who had lost their partner and simply couldn‚Äôt imagine it happening to me and my perfect life. if i would have known when i kissed him goodbye that it would be the end, i would have never let him go. i was supposed to go but woke up with a stomach bug. i should have powered through it and gone with him. he would still be alive, i would have kept him from dozing off for the second that ended his life.

post_05510,"friend told me she wasn't attracted to baldness and basically wouldn't date for that reason. i was in a vc with her and her fiance (also my friend), the fiance is already pretty badly balding, and he was gonna get a haircut, so i jokingly said why not fully shave.

then the friend was like nope (sounded controlling to me), she's like no that's not happening, i'm like why what's wrong with it, and she's all like well ""it's just i don't like it"", i jokingly said just get used to it, he's your partner, then she tries to justify it and give me reasons saying in ""netherlands"" (if anyone's from nl let me know if this is true) specifically people don't usually date other bald guys, and i'm like why? then she's like because baldness can be associated with not taking care of yourself, bad genes, and something about it being associated with bad people. and i'm listening to this and i'm not buying anything, i'm like okay but not every bald person is bad, so i'm like breaking down her ""percieved"" logical reasons, which i don't find logical at all, i also looked it up balding doesn't necessarily mean bad genes, i kept saying it depends, it's circumstancial, but you're taking one singular physical aspect and saying it's bad for these reasons, i got so triggered because it sounded so stupid.

now everyone's entitled to their preference, if you like someone with hair you like someone with hair, if you like someone with blue eyes you like someone with blue eyes, i'm not judging about that.

now what's driving me insane is idk why she's with someone who's gonna be complete bald at some point anyway??? aaand i'm just sitting here thinking her fiance must have felt bad about it, cuz she's essentially saying if he doesn't have hair she wouldn't find him attractive, i'm here like dude's maybe got 5-20 years maybe until he's fully bald.

i had to let it out, we had this conversation yesterday and it's clearly still on my mind, it's also the way she made it sound as if baldness was inherently unattractive, which btw i don't see it that way, i think plenty of bald men look quite cool and attractive, so if any bald guy reads this, you're cool man and don't lose hope there's always someone who would be into you, it's just not gonna be people like my friend here and according to her most women from nl.",0

post_03090,"xanax is not enough? i talked to my doctor about my medication. i told him i haven‚Äôt started taking my antidepressant yet because xanax is enought to help with my anxiety, which is my main concern. but he said it‚Äôs only temporary relief, and i need to take the antidepressant to address the root cause of my anxiety.

i thought i was doing fine, i felt okay with just taking xanax, but i guess i have to take the antidepressant too and just deal with the side effects, which i‚Äôve been trying to avoid for a long time. 

any thoughts on this?

post_00299,"suicidal ideation sucks everyday ive asked myself why i‚Äôm still here. i never have a reason. instead, i find all the reasons why i shouldn‚Äôt be. i contemplate death. my life could be so much worse but so much better. i have few people in my life who care about me but they mean the world to me. unfortunately, i think they‚Äôd be better without me and my love for them may only permit me to stay for so long. i‚Äôm 27, no kids, no partner, no interest, no passion. i‚Äôve given up. why try? i don‚Äôt have a reason. so now, i‚Äôm just a shell of a person. self sabotaging and getting worse over the years. i‚Äôve become what i hate. i‚Äôm suffering everyday and there‚Äôs no easy way out. i just want a pill to pass in peace. i‚Äôm over this life. i don‚Äôt see a happy ending.

post_00415,"i find it kinda funny that ‚Äúnormal‚Äù people see suicide as unimaginable or something that you‚Äôd ‚Äúnever do‚Äù. it hits me every once in a while that normal people don‚Äôt think about suicide as often as i do. i‚Äôm not even actively suicidal right now, but i consider it often enough for me to realize that i‚Äôm one of the outliers in society. so, over the years suicide has become more and more realistic, and has almost become a part of my daily life.

what gets me though is how that‚Äôs *totally* not the case for everyone else. if you mention suicide, people either freak out or just play it off as a joke as if the concept of ‚Äúsuicide‚Äù only exists in movies and books. and while it is sad, i actually find that kind of funny.

for example, i hate working. i fucking hate getting up early to sit at a desk doing shit i don‚Äôt want to do for 8 hours straight. but if i tell anyone about that feeling, guess how the conversation will go?

me: man, i really don‚Äôt want a job. i wish i could just sit around doing nothing all day.

them: well you need money, don‚Äôt you?

me: yeah but i don‚Äôt want to get a job.

them: tough, that‚Äôs the way the world works, you lazy fuck. you‚Äôve gotta work if you wanna live.

me: well technically i don‚Äôt *have* to, because i could just kill myself and not have to deal with it.

them: seriously? you‚Äôd rather commit suicide than get a job? that‚Äôs pathetic.

me: yep, i‚Äôm pathetic. thanks for reminding me, that‚Äôs another reason why i should just kill myself.

them: wait, you‚Äôre serious? nooooo don‚Äôt kill yourself you‚Äôre loved and you have so much to live for!!!!

i just find it funny that people don‚Äôt consider how all of this bullshit could just stop immediately if i put a gun in my mouth. they‚Äôre like ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt want to live by the world‚Äôs rules, you don‚Äôt get to live at all >:(‚Äú

but when i decide ‚Äúyeah that sounds fair enough, guess i‚Äôll just off myself then :)‚Äù their tune changes and they can‚Äôt fathom that anyone would choose to not live in this vicious cycle of suffering and guilt.

of course i can‚Äôt say any of this shit in real life, because i don‚Äôt think this attitude helps in the slightest. it‚Äôs nice to think and rant about online, but if i started telling people how i really feel i‚Äôd get thrown back into the psych ward. or worse, people i care about would get tired of my moping around and they‚Äôd cut me off, and then i‚Äôd *have* to go through with it.

everything‚Äôs fucked, and the only *‚Äùreal‚Äù* solution i can come up with is just opting out of life. and if i bring it up before actually going through with it, i can only expect to be mocked or bombarded with insincere attempts at ‚Äúhelping‚Äù.

post_06303,"my daughter has no idea how the things she does impact my life took my daughter on vacation and ended up getting screwed out of our place to stay once we arrived, costing hundreds and hundreds of dollars in car, gas, hotel, food, the works. we cleaned out the kitchen before we left so as to not come home to any old food, and upon returning home, i was sweating trying to figure out what we were even going to have for dinner our first night back.

i came back from an errand to find she'd made spaghetti for dinner, with seasonings and sauce, the works.

i didn't ask her, i didn't say anything about dinner, but she took it upon herself to make sure dinner was ready when i got home.

as a single parent, that means more to me than a three course gourmet meal at the best place in town and these simple things make my heart just explode.

i‚Äôve attempted a few times i don‚Äôt know why i‚Äôm still alive, first time i was in a coma, another time a friend found me, i had an nde, another time i was rushed to the hospital when i jumped off a cliff. somehow i‚Äôm still here. i survived cancer. now i might be battling again.

i did my part in life, i treated others with kindness, i never did drugs, i treated others with fairness, i never drank except 8 years ago when i suffered depression and never really liked getting drunk so much.
i went to college and graduated. i did my part in life. even if i get yelled at or bullied by others.

ever since losing my job and becoming homeless i never found my purpose. it‚Äôs been almost 2 years this year. the only thing i have is my son. he visited me at the hospital and hugged me and told me he misses and loves me.

but the thing is, i have nothing. no matter how much i look for work, no matter what i do, i get nothing. my son‚Äôs mom yells at me, people get angry at me, even if i‚Äôm just helping people out i get yelled at. they say stop being so nice or pretending to be nice. i was angry a long time ago and i hated being angry or even being pushed to breaking.

what do i do? i can‚Äôt provide for my kid, i can‚Äôt even find a job at a fuckin fast food, or even wash cars cuz of my condition. they say find help here and there, every call, nothing. no help.

i wanted to freeze to death, might be simple since i have no where to go. my car‚Äôs gone, it was down for a while and i can‚Äôt even get the money for repairs completely. my car was income doing deliveries. i have nothing and i‚Äôm crying asking god why i‚Äôm still alive and asking what my purpose is on this earth. my son probably sees me as a loser who‚Äôs homeless. i‚Äôm ashamed to be his father. no matter what i do to spend time with him or even see him.

i pray daily for a miracle to turn my life around but there‚Äôs nothing for me at all. i‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôs cancer again so it can eat me alive. even thinking maybe i should just either freeze outside these single digit temps, or try to jump again at the park‚Äôs cliff. my anxiety and depression is so high. i just wanna end it so no one has to suffer seeing me like this.

its pathetic. she's told the government so many lies which will affect me eventually. shes told food stamps me and my sister dont live with her, although the houses rent is in my sisters name. and all our documents list that we live in the house. shes told the insurance that we don't work at all or go to school, not a single bit despite us being mid-early twenties. to the landlord we only work a few hours a week because we're lazy. to our housing voucher (they pay half of rent) i barely work because im a terrible lazy daughter and they dont like me.

the web of lies has gotten so tangled the insurance, food stamps, and housing voucher (state worked), are asking us what's going on.

i need therapy. im not doing well. i need medication, i am constantly losing my mind. all i hear is her screaming at me that i'm doing something wrong. i grab the wrong thing at work? ""oh my fucking god you dont ever ***listen*** . its the left one. you fucking i swear to god."" im not working nearly enough to pay all of rent, food, therapy, and to keep saving up to move out and get my own car. my heart is starting to give up. i feel it. i can sense it's starting to fail me and my body is showing signs something severe is happening.

im scared i will lose my insurance and just. die. before i can move out, and have my first car and have my first apartment and just everything. or i get out and im able to do it but i'm still slowly dying or something.

her lies have ruined so so much of my life. she's a compulsive liar and has npd and she refuses to accept it. she refused to listen to her therapist to which she swiftly dropped because of it.

30th, he kept groping her and she kept telling him no, so i got between them until he left. on the 31st, he kept pouring her drinks until she was so drunk she knocked over beer pong and he tried to get inside her.

i ended up shoving him and hitting him with a solo cup, and the only other women there backed me up. he said it wasn‚Äôt his fault that she ‚Äúacted single‚Äù and some of the other drunk dudes agreed with him. i told him he was a piece of shit, and took her back to my barracks room begging her to report in the morning. 

she did not, because she was afraid of being in trouble. cut to one year later (i wasn‚Äôt there for this one) but it happened again, and she reported it.

post_02038,"i see no path forward for me. i (29m) am going to use this as a word vomit. potentially practice for a suicide note.

i cannot fathom my life improving. in fact, for the past 5 years, it has gotten progressively worse. and now it‚Äôs just unbearable. i have nothing. i worked for 7 years in college and postgrad to escape trauma from every type of abuse from both parents. but doing so led to racking up unbelievable student loan debt, and now i can‚Äôt even make ends meet. although sober now, years of alcoholism and addiction to weed led me to episodes of induced psychosis/mania that, in turn, caused me to cut off or lose all family, lose positive direction in my career, and almost all friends, besides my best friend and his wife. and i feel like such a burden to them. like a 3rd wheel, being invited to things only because of how pitifully lonely my life is. but i did this to myself, i shouldn‚Äôt be their burden to bear. my physical health has deteriorated. i grew up without sports and am unfit, which led me to needing spinal surgery during covid, causing a constant fear that it is too late to begin a fitness journey. i have a dog whom i love dearly, but my lack of finances and depression have led to him having skin conditions that i am having serious issues resolving on my own. i feel like such a failure for not giving him all of the care he needs.

i feel like a lost cause. i feel like, at 29 with no family and one real friend, that it is impossible to recover from the hole i dug myself in. i am tired of being a burden to my friend, my dog. my dog would be much better off in the care of someone with better finances and mental health. my friend shouldn‚Äôt feel the responsibility of making me happy simply because i can‚Äôt do it myself.

i see a psychiatrist, but i feel as if he overmedicated me to a point of this suicide ideation, leading me to voluntarily spend christmas & new years in a psych ward, although i would‚Äôve spent it alone otherwise. i am starting emdr therapy, but spending $80 per session without having started the actual emdr so far is like a costly tease.

the state of the us has not helped my thought processes. as i work in supplemental food assistance programs, i fear my job security is in jeopardy. and i fear for my clients, who many are immigrants. vitriol, hate, and disinformation won, and i genuinely fear that we will not have another election again. nazi salutes from oligarchs in government further this fear.

i dont have access to firearms. i‚Äôm aware that overdosing is risky and can leave me worse off than i am now. i‚Äôve constantly thought of driving fast off of a highway into the tree line, but the risks of living and mangling myself stop me.

i bought rope last weekend. 362 pound load bearing rope. i have nowhere to hang myself for a full suspension hanging, but a partial hanging is doable in my closet. i‚Äôve practiced and can hit my carotid artery just right. the only thing stopping me is that my dog is here, and i don‚Äôt want him to see my lifeless body.

post_03740,"heart wont stop racing, scared for the worst hello, earlier this week i started experiencing dizziness and heightened heart rate. my chest was slightly hurting but it was no big deal. the next day i felt absolutely terrible and that night had such bad full body tremors it took me forever to go to sleep. my heart was pounding the entire time. yesterday i had to go to the school counselor and the nurse made sure i didnt have a concussion, but today the feeling persists (even worse than before). this morning i woke up still shaky, and by the time i got to school my heart was racing and i was having full body tremors again. i spent the entire day trying not to panic and then when i got home it all came back again. my chest kinda hurts sometimes, and as im typing this my heart is still racing and im still shaking despite not hyperventilating and resting for a long while. the school nurse checked my pulse and told me my resting heart rate was at 107, im not entirely sure what that means for me. earlier my heart was beating so loudly and my chest felt so exhausted i seriously felt like i was going to die, my chest still feels tired even now. im unsure if this is just anxiety, everyone i know is telling me that it is but it doesnt feel that way at all. ive asked my parents to take me to the er but they told me theres no point because im ""just having a panic attack."" whatever this is has lasted longer than 48 hours and hasnt shown any improvement. im really scared im having a heart attack or something.

post_01653,"i made a terrifying discovery (venting). hello reddit,

so i have suicidal thoughts. way too often and it's getting worse. it recently led me to try the national 24/7 suicide hotline in my country. i would say out of curiosity because i'm not ready to end myself from fear of failing to do so. and what a ride it's been.
it doesn't even properly ring before you get a recorded answer. it says that nobody can answer and they hope to hear from you soon if you try to call later. of course, later is never late enough. i tried several times until i skipped to what they advise doing if you can't wait for help : calling emergencies.
at this point i'm pondering what i am doing because emergencies is not what i need and their purpose is to help people in danger, not listening to john doe's existential crisis but here i go.
the dude's reaction once i explained the situation is exactly ""what am i supposed to do ?"" in an obviously irritated and not-my-problem kind of tone. understandable, not your job good sir. after a brief exchange and i've apologised for wasting his time best used for something more important, he at least gives me another phone number to call.
this one rings, great. then i get the inavoidable ""can't take your call now"" record. from what i understand it's a 24/7 hotline for lonely people in need of a talk.
back to suicide hotline because there's no more backup plan, still not later enough.
i had to confess all this to somebody because of my inability to hide how far down i got anymore. i called the suicide hotline in front of this person without hesitation knowing full well nobody will ever answer and so the guy gets to hear the abomination of a message they deliver.
so i came to a conclusion. had i been on the verge of ending it all when calling, this would have dealt the final blows (because it's been several blows to me) and i'd have crossed the line for good. how many people might have experienced just that and felt even more desperate and lonely when they were already at rock bottom ? has this hotline killed more people than they helped ?
so if you're alone and in critical need of help in my country, well i salute you and hope you'll rest in peace. because nobody gives a damn fuck.",1

post_03265,"could my excessive screen time be the root of all my suffering? hi everyone, i experienced my first panic attack two months ago and have since been dealing with severe anxiety, including 4-5 panic attacks and various physical symptoms that always make me feel sick or off, along with feelings of derealization and dissociation. i don't have any significant stressors like stressful work or relationship drama or other trauma that could explain this anxiety, and i‚Äôm fortunate to have a supportive family and great friends. i eat relatively healthy and am in my mid-20s, with no prior history of anxiety or depression.

upon reflecting on my life, i realized i spend an excessive amount of time on my phone, around 11 hours a day on tiktok and instagram. while i've managed to reduce my screen time slightly since the first attack, i still struggle with anxiety and panic. could my high screen time be contributing to my anxiety?

post_06220,"2331 days trigger warning talk of suicide. on august 14th 2014 i sat down in my shower and tried to commit suicide.

i made plans with a friend so they would find me.

i got undressed. sat down stuck the barrel of my rifle into my mouth and pulled the trigger.

the round was a dud and after psyching myself up for it once i couldn't again. i just didn't have the energy.
i tossed the gun away turned on the shower and sat in there crying until my friend found me.
she held my naked pathetic ass in that shower until i passed out. she dried me off and tucked me into bed. she never spoke of it after that.

i had been financially ruined by my then ex fiance who was cheating on me. my mother was diagnosed with terminal breast cancer. i had a shit job with no prospects. i was in a bad place.

in the last 2331 days i have.

fallen in love.

took my first plane ride.

moved to another state

got engaged

broke up

moved back home

found my purpose in life

went back to school

got my driver's license

started a business

got my associates degree

tool up jewelry making

ran my business into the ground

got into my dream school

bought my first car



i did all that and more. i have met wonderful people and friends. i have done things i never thought i would and gone places i never imagined.

this month i celebrated christmas with my mother who has been in remission for five years. 

next year i will finish my bachelor's degree with my masters not far behind.


i got a second chance at life because of a bullet manufactured in turkey 70 years ago failed quality control.

i guess what i'm trying to say is that sometimes you just need to get through that bad moment in time to come out the other side. life can get better.

post_00167,"people think i need therapy but i'm fine i've told my two closest friends about this and they both told me similar things. let me start by saying that the both of them along with a few others come to me often in times of need for advice or help and for the most part i do my best to help, telling them the usual break down, try to look at things from a brighter perspective, invest in your interests, don't try and control things out of your control, ect. and i've been doing this for adults and kids alike since i 8. but personally i've tried it all, i've tried viewing everything from a different perspective but that doesn't erase the filth that clouds the streets, or the corruption i overhear/see daily, even cutting myself off from media only created distance between me and the world, in every convo i could never keep up, so instead i tried investing in my personal interest, mma, pc, iiado and music and have gotten fairly good, i workout and i've worked hard to build my body, i'm 6ft 168lb and fairly lean, i work two jobs, mainly commute by walking and live with my parents. i say all of this not to glaze myself but because i'm well aware that i have an enviable life and i'm very grateful for my life but. i hate this world, with every fiber of my being i hate humanity, we're all scum. when i look around and see what other call great testaments of man, i see nothing but destruction and an unwashable rot painting its way across a canvas like water washing away a masterpiece and it makes me sick, but i can't help but be a cog in the machine because nothing i do in my lifetime will change anything by any significant margin. and as far as having a family i won't bring another life into this place, not with my tainted blood, and i could never let someone love me, the thought turns my stomach, i've hurt so many and done so much wrong im not, i can't. but it's okay, i'm not writing this behind tears, it's okay and i'm satisfied with the experiences i've already made, now i just want to work myself to death and leave whatever money i make to my next of kin, whoever it may be.",1

post_01374,"suicidal ideation  i‚Äôm new to this sub and have found it interesting to read people‚Äôs posts and comments. i‚Äôm writing this simply because i have never said this to anyone other than my therapist. i am 45 years old, growing up there was no internet to connect with people, so i truly thought i was alone. i have had suicidal ideations since i was around 8 years old. not really sure when it started, but the earliest clear memory is from 4th grade. i was bullied at a young age. i can remember wanting to jump from the roof of a building onto the playground in front of everybody. i think i wanted to do that so people would see that i was suffering. hard to know really. 
i‚Äôve dealt with the desire to die. wanting to die. planning my suicide. fearing suicide. fearing what an afterlife might be. fearing the pain that i would cause, even though i simultaneously felt completely unlovable. years of alcoholism hoping it would kill me. it‚Äôs more obvious now that the drinking made coping with suicidal thoughts much worse. 
in elementary or middle school i told my mom that i wanted to kill myself. i‚Äôve told 3 friends over the years that i have been afraid that i will kill myself. i don‚Äôt think they took it seriously. 
i have always wondered if i was actually suicidal or just consumed with thinking about it. has anyone else ever wondered that? i called a hotline once when in an acute crisis around age 35. it‚Äôs hard to know how that night would have gone if not for the compassion of the woman on the other end of the line. 
i am doing better now. i have a great wife and an amazing 2 year old son. the thoughts are still with me, but not as painful as in the past. the actual desire to die has waned. whatever happens, i now know that suicide is off the table. i need to be here for my son.

as soon as i got inside my nice toasty apartment i couldn't stop thinking about how the poor guy must be freezing. i couldn't help but feel such an aching sadness that so many people just would walk past, not doing anything because of their discomfort, just like the discomfort i was feeling. i decided fuck it, show this guy the care and common decency you would want if you were in a similar situation. i found a spare blanket i had, nice and fuzzy and warm, and a hot water bottle i don't use and filled it up with hot boiled water. i was shaking so hard at this point and almost chickened out.

post_06271,"my boyfriend and i had anal last night. my rapist has nothing on me anymore. tw: sa

in 2016 i went out with some friends. long story short, the friends didn't stick around and i ended up being anally raped. i was married at the time, we were already on the rocks but this was the straw that broke the camel's back. i couldn't tell my ex about it because i knew he would say i was cheating on him and make it my fault. i even got a kidney infection after and he yelled at me in the er about how it was my drinking and me not taking care of myself that caused this. and now he couldn't have sex with me so my decisions have negativity effected him. he had no idea what had happened and there was no way i was telling him. suffice to say the whole experience was very traumatic and i don't talk to anyone about it.

fast forward to 2018 when i started dating my boyfriend. he's cute, he's funny, the total package. once we started getting more serious i told him enough of the story and explained that butt stuff was just not on the table. it had taken so much work for me to be able to do anything else, that was just a no go. being the absolute perfect gem he is, he just accepted it, never asked questions, never pushed me, he was always cool with whatever my comfort level is. 

we have been together for 5 years and he is the absolute love of my life, he has accepted my daughter as his own and has undone years of trauma left from my ex. after we put my daughter to bed last night we decided we'd get a little frisky and have some fun. there was nothing special about yesterday, nothing either one of us did or said but for whatever reason we ended up having anal.

guys it was beautiful and i can't tell anyone about it. i was in control the whole time. it was me and i was taking back my own pleasure. no one told me i had to, no one forced me to. it was all my decision. i was in shock afterward. i kept expecting it to hurt, or for me to feel all those terrible feelings again. but i didn't, i just got cuddles from the most amazing guy i've ever met.

 there is nothing left that i can say my rapist took from me, i have taken it all back. i no longer have to say things are off the table. i know, i know, it won't always be perfect and beautiful every time. and i know there will always be a part of me that is broken, a part that will never be the same. but overcoming that was huge for me, i feel so empowered and strong.

i‚Äôve always known that she‚Äôs rather depressive and anxious but lately i feel like her own emotions are weighing me down and i feel bad for saying it but it is so exhausting to only talk about her mental health and her issues all the time. i can‚Äôt talk about my own university because she gets sad/mad that i‚Äôm doing well, i can‚Äôt talk about my friends because she gets jealous because she has no friends, and i can‚Äôt even leave my phone down for a second because she gets upset if i don‚Äôt answer in a couple of minutes max.

i know she‚Äôs going through a lot and that she‚Äôs hurting but i feel like i want a way out at this point. i don‚Äôt know if i‚Äôm simply being unsupportive or just a bad partner but it feels like it‚Äôs slowly getting to me too. ",0
post_00579,"i just needed to write this out hey everyone, i've been struggling with suicidal thoughts for the past 2 years or so. it's gotten to the point where everytime my mind wonders, it comes up. every time i'm driving, walking down a street with traffic, etc there's that stray voice telling me that it will be painless, and it's been an increasingly appealing way to deal with my feelings. 

my 25th birthday is coming up, and i feel like i haven't accomplished anything. i have about 6 classes before i can graduate college. i had a job working with children that really helped me feel like a productive member of society, but i had to become a floater due to my class schedule. now i'm stuck just doordashing, and doing odd jobs for money. i have no girlfriend, and the idea of getting one seems like a fantasy at this point. 

i've been trying to be more social over the last two years ago, and i just feel so out of place. i don't even feel seen. it's like i'm an observer. like i'm stuck behind a pane of glass, while i'm trying to socialize. this has really solidified a feeling of isolation, even when trying to combat it. i'm just really struggling with finding a community that seems to accept/want me even in the college club/hobby groups. i just feel like i'm ""doing everything right"", and still coming up empty-handed, and it really is demoralizing.

i understand that to an extent, i'll probably always be depressed. it's going to be a companion throughout my life. i just wanted to ask for help, see if what i'm feeling is common. it's so much worse thinking that it's just me dealing with these feelings. 

i needed to write this out. thank you to anyone who responds with kind words. ",1

i‚Äôm jewish and a yiddish speaker. (actually learned yiddish last year) . i‚Äôve recently become hyper fixated on being jewish culturally around a few months ago after my jewish mother who has been ill for years began to explore some jewish stuff and showed me a yom kippur service. i am now collecting insane amounts of judaica, calling g-d hashem in every situation almost, listening to tons of jewish music, using yiddish for almost everything dispute not being around any speakers, eating mainly ashkenazi jewish foods, and wearing jewish stuff everywhere. now this is fine if i lived in a completely jewish community, but now i‚Äôm afraid that i could easily trigger an antisemitic reaction or be mistaken as someone who is pretending to be jewish. jewish girls are my closest friends as they remind me of my family. i wish one day my mom would do better.

1. the woman who‚Äôs celebrating with her husband who is being investigated because he was having an affair with a local elementary school teacher, got her addicted to meth, gave her so much that she od‚Äôd, pushed her body out of his car at the emergency room and drove off, and she ended up dying, leaving behind an orphaned 8 year old son.


2. the mid 20 year old girl who got a dui because she got shitfaced and couldn‚Äôt find her car, so she called the cops and reported it stolen, eventually found it and drove away, only to get pulled over for driving a vehicle that was reported stolen. she got handcuffed and flashed her breasts to about a hundred onlookers.


3. the local former cop who had a reputation for preying on middle school and high school girls. he would pull over freshly 16 year olds to the point that their parents had to tell them not to drive alone at night. oh and his wife and her dad got convicted for embezzlement previously.

i hate this country haha

edit: if three isn‚Äôt a big enough sample size:

4. the boss i had who would reminisce to me about the times he went to visit factories he leased in china and how he would throw us dollars at workers and watch them fight over them.

5. the hotel tycoon who owns 80% of the town, exploits his workers, and regularly scams and cons  guests out of their money, keeps the town impoverished, and was so bad that he got investigated by the states ag.

6.  gay former meth addict who has been arrested twice for buying meth and convicted once for sexually assaulting a woman.

not only did my initial plans get ruined because of all this, but this was the worse crisis intervention worker i've met so far. these people always think mid-episode is the best time to invalidate your feelings and experiences. he told me flat out that my trauma was ""just events,"" reduced my depression to bullying in middle school (this was the only type of trauma he asked about,) and gave the usual ""you don't know what life has to offer"" speech. not a single thing of substance came out of his mouth. i told everyone that being in the hospital or involved with an outside team would make my depression worse, and what do you know, it did! it's almost like i actually *do* know myself and my life better than other people. who could have guessed?

this is my life. i should have the choice on if i continue breathing or not. no one else has to live my life, so no one else should have a say in it. i'm so fucking tired of being forced to stay alive no matter my wishes, just to keep others happy. that's the last time i tell anyone what's going on with me. my next attempt will be much quieter.",1

post_05364,"don‚Äôt want them to be homeless but don‚Äôt want to continue being their quasi-mother my ex and i (both 24 at that time) moved to another state and moved in together when we had been together for about 9 months (lesbians, am i right?). we moved because of a job that i got and i knew that it would take a few months for my ex to find a job, so i was happy to cover the rent and bills until then - it was a stretch and we were living paycheck to paycheck but i made it work. i started noticing their money issues around this time, but was blinded by love (lol) and let it slide; i‚Äôm also not perfect with money and often spend a bit too much on clothes or food that probably should‚Äôve gone to savings or bills. it started to ware on me, though, because, again, i was paying all the bills. even once they got a job, they struggled to pay their half of the bills and rent. we lived together for two years and throughout that time, i‚Äôd say they were able to help with bills only about 15-20% of the time. this is also partially because they kept getting fired from jobs - in those two years, they held four different minimum wage jobs (not at the same time) and only stayed at each for, at most, 6-8 months before they were fired. some of this was exacerbated by mental health issues, which i‚Äôm understanding of, but, again, it started to ware on me. throughout this time, too, i was also paying for most of the food, pet food, and other daily living expenses while working at pretty intense jobs (social work/helping professions) and then coming home to take care of all the house needs (they refused to cook because our oven set off the smoke alarm once and since then they were too scared to use it); i‚Äôm also watching door dash orders be delivered almost every day and seeing them buy new clothes regularly, things that i was forgoing because we were living paycheck to paycheck. obviously all of this built up and i broke up with them a few days after we hit two years together in august. the problem, though, was that we‚Äôd already signed the lease for that year. i felt bad so i said that they could stay, but that they‚Äôd have to start actually paying rent and bills - spoiler alert: they didn‚Äôt. it‚Äôs now april and they‚Äôve paid their half of rent only twice and they‚Äôve never paid bills. for a large portion of this time, they didn‚Äôt have a job because they got fired again. on top of all this, they are very emotionally needy and get hurt when i try to put in boundaries. i‚Äôm spending most days locked in my room or else i‚Äôm forced to make nice and listen to them talk about alllll the steps they‚Äôre taking to better themself and ensure they can move out. i don‚Äôt understand how this is ever going to happen if they still can‚Äôt pay rent or bills while living with me. i‚Äôm exhausted - i wrote a lot about the money aspect because that‚Äôs concrete, but the emotional aspect of living with my pretty mentally unstable and emotionally immature ex is draining me. i told them they need to be out by august, preferably sooner, but i‚Äôm hitting a breaking point of being able to deal with all of this. if i were to force them out right now, they would be homeless for sure, but i also worry that august will come and they still won‚Äôt have found a place and i‚Äôll end up making them homeless anyway. don‚Äôt know how to end this out, but thank you for reading i guess lol",0

sumasama ang loob ko dahil hirap na hirap silang mag labas ng pera para sa nanay ko. ibig kong sabihin. bakit parang hirap sila tumulong? kung kaya naman nila? nakapag pagawa na sila ng bahay na mala mansiyon may kotse na rin. at kung saan saan nakakapuntang bansa at concert. pero pag tulong para sa ct scan ng mama ko parang dedma lang kami. 

don't get me wrong. alam kong wala silang responsibilidad sa nanay ko. dahil una, sarili nilang pera yun. sila ang gumagawa ng paraan para kitain nila yun. pero bakit ganun? alam na alam nila kung gaano namin kailangan ang mama ko. dahil sa dami namin, hindi ko alam paano kami kapag nawala ang mama ko. hindi ko alam kung saan kami pupulutin. 

mahal na mahal ko si mama sobra. call center agent lang ako at ang sweldo ko ay kulang na kulang pa dahil sa dami kong bayarin at pangangailangan ng mama ko, mga kapatid ko para sa pag aaral nila. 

hindi ko alam, pero sana makapag pa ct scan na ang mama ko. nag pa schedule na rin kami sa pgh. pero, months pa raw ang aantayin bago ma schedule ang mama ko which is nakaka takot kung aantayin pa namin yon. kasi sa totoo lang, hirap na si mama. gustong gusto ko na siyang gumaling. gustong gusto ko pa siya makasama, mayakap. at kasabay kumain.

post_02640,"i never thought i‚Äôd feel this empty at just 16(m) *repost* everyone around me seemed to be finding love, the few friends i do have now have been in loving relationships for a while. no matter how hard i try, i can't seem to connect with anyone every time i try to talk to girl they always look at me as i'm the ugliest person in the world. last year i was bullied severely by people who i thought were my friends for being overweight, this caused me to starve myself down to a healthy weight. the motivation i kept through the starvation was that i would be more attractive and appealing to girls, but not a thing has changed, i have never kissed anyone, been complimented, hugged another person in my life. i lie awake at night, wondering what is wrong with me, why i cant be like everyone else why i cant be loved. the loneliness is unbearable, it's a constant reminder that i am completely unlovable. most days, it feels like the world is moving forward without me, and i started believing it wouldn't matter if i was gone. i tried to distract myself by going to the gym and trying other hobbies but the pain is always there. i wanted someone to see me, to care, to make me feel like i mattered. i have a therapist who i have told all my problems but they don't offer me any advice and they don't see it as a big problem. i came on here as a last result to see if anyone can relate to me or offer me advice or can give me reasons to not end my life.",1
post_06171,"i got my 75yr old dad a shroom trip for his birthday. my dad has never done a drug in his life. in fact, we grew up in a pretty religious household. no drinking, no drugs. ever. 

a few months ago i watched ‚Äòfantastic fungi‚Äô on netflix. it‚Äôs really good. pretty amazing little organisms and as my dad is a scholar, i suggested he watch it. afterwards, my dad said that he would really like to try them. 

his birthday is tomorrow so my husband and i planned for my hubs to take my mom out for a date day (she would worry too much). in fact, my siblings are also pretty strict so wouldn‚Äôt understand and we couldn‚Äôt bring them in on it. i can‚Äôt tell anyone for obvious reasons (although we do live in a marijuana friendly state - getting there!). 

my dad is currently downstairs, curled up in blankets in his favourite recliner, candle burning, listening to his second hour of enya. he has the dog in his lap, an eye mask on and the biggest grin i‚Äôve ever seen. i‚Äôm checking in on him constantly. 

happy birthday dad!

update 

so many responses and one one negative. that surprises me more than anything. are we on the verge of acceptance and understanding? 

as for my dads trip: he loved it. he thinks everyone should try it once in their lives. he went through so many phases (as expected) from yawning to giggling, to seeing and hallucinating, to crying, to feeling and understanding experiences (his own and others). 

his biggest take away was the warmth and understanding. as many have said, you don‚Äôt know until you‚Äôve been there. he feels as though he understood what god really was and was amazed as the entire experience. he doesn‚Äôt regret any part of it and is happy it happened now. he‚Äôs at a time of his life of reflection and is open to understanding. 

my mother on the other hand‚Ä¶she was brought back about 5.5hrs after my dad started his journey. i told her right away as my dad was relaxing as he came out of it all. she was not happy. too uptight and would never be a candidate for such an experience. she‚Äôs been checking in him every 10mins or so and wouldn‚Äôt have been a calming influence to have around. he‚Äôs totally fine now though of course. 

my name is mud for a bit.

i just found out that my ex has a new gf only a month after we stopped talking. i‚Äôm not upset bc i want him back, im upset bc he gets to be happy and i don‚Äôt. everyone i‚Äôve talked to has found ‚Äúthe one‚Äù after dating or talking to me and it makes me feel miserable. after finding this out i started to feel so much pain in my heart that i crashed out and impulsively attempted to slit my wrists. at first i was real serious abt killing myself and just getting it over with but after a little bit i became scared. scared about dying, scared abt the pain i was feeling, scared my parents would find me. more so i was scared abt people thinking i killed myself over a guy. i began to feel lightheaded and sort of passed out before unconsciously cleaning up the mess and lying down. 
it makes me so sad bc obviously i don‚Äôt want to die if i suddenly snap out of it and begin to regret all my decisions but everything in me constantly tells me that i deserve it and need to finish the job. i feel so unloved and worthless so much recently and feel like i add nothing to anyone‚Äôs lives. it‚Äôs so unfair bc why can‚Äôt i feel normal? why do i get to feel miserable all the time but others don‚Äôt? what did i do to deserve this :(( 
 does this actually count as an attempt? i never know if my ‚Äúattempts‚Äù are real or not bc i don‚Äôt go deep enough or purposely take less pills than the amount to actually od.

be honest with me, should i try to be admitted to a psych ward? ik im 18 and can admit myself but ive heard horrible things abt stuff that happen in there and would feel embarrassed that my cuts aren‚Äôt very deep or that it wasn‚Äôt a real attempt. idk what to do anymore bc i always thought i was just being silly and it wasn‚Äôt very serious. but ive become more scared that i actually will do it. i feel like as long as im breathing ill never find peace or happiness.

and now it's after christmas, but i still can't die. i have an amazon order for my stepdad's retirement dinner. it's just a $8 coffee mug, but i have to wait for it to arrive so i can fill it with jelly beans and give it to him this weekend.

then the weekend after that is my brother's 21 birthday. sure as fuck can't die before that. what a shitty way to spend your 21st birthday. and the weekend after that my other brother and sister (the twins) are turning 18. i planned on making my sister some cute jewelry, so i still really don't have time to die if i actually intend on getting that made.

post_00612,"being gay is a curse. an affliction. the only cure for it is leaving  i was gay since i was very little,  before i even knew what it was or had seen or heard of it as a concept. i remember i was like 6 or 7 and the commercial for the first harry potter movie came in the tv and i had my first little crush. i had crushes like that until around 11 or 12 when i hit puberty, then the physical changes happened and i really knew what i was. and i knew what gay was by then but from then on, until 8th grade,  every day i'd tell myself ""don't worry, you're fine, this won't last, you'll be normal soon"". i'd also pray every night for ""god"" to make me normal. when i got to 8th grade, i realized it wasn't a phase and there was no ""god"" who was going to cure me.  that's the time i had suicidal ideation.

every year that went by,  the more i learned and experienced just how despised my kind are by most people. and every year i felt worse and worse. and i learned to hate myself at the very core. there's part of me that every time i look in the mirror, all i see are every single words that people think of me as. i'm a blight that's infecting this world. i'm a demonic, satanic, degenerate, perverted, sick fucking freak who has no place here. it doesn't even matter if i believe it or not,  the fact is most people in this world do, and that's all that matters. to them, i am one of the worst things one can possibly be and i am incompatible with a good society and a threat to the very foundation of family. 

i have other issues as well, typical life bs. no friends, hardly any family. still don't have  a career. fat. the place i'm in right now with all that is mostly my fault, i see that now. i've sabotaged myself so many times are purposefully wrecked so many good opportunities because of that self hatred i hold. its like i could never allow myself to succeed because i don't think i deserve it.  and i guess i don't. 

throughout the years i've had small slivers of hope or moments where i tried to just push through and live the best i can. i went back to school this past semester to try and do what i've always wanted to. but then the election happened and it truly cemented what i've always known. in a way it's a good thing, like a band aid being ripped off. they want me gone and it kind of makes it easier because i know that leaving actually makes so many people truly happy. there's tons more of my kind out there but at least i'm doing my part. i dropped my classes, quit my job and i'm just wrapping things up. before spring is ideal..there's something really comforting about the cold and earlier darkness.

also it really fucking pisses me off and makes me think about life and what this all is, if anything. i never asked to be what i am. i didn't want to be a homosexual, i never chose it. the natural opinions of us by the vast majority of people make it clear that we shouldn't exist. i'm just unlucky that i end up with this infliction. despite all of that, it's still hard to actually do but i know it's the only option that makes sense. it's inhumane that safe, legal options aren't available to leave ",1

post_06816,"i watched another man fuck my wife and i think it gave me ptsd my wife of 9 years approached me about 3 years ago about opening our relationship and trying polyamory. originally, she wasn't interested, so far as i knew, in seeing anyone else. i'm bisexual and because we got together and had kids at a very young age, i never really got to experience that side of myself. i've always been open and honest with her about it, though and she was super supportive and open minded about, and knew that it was something i wanted to explore but couldn't really ask her for. 

she gave me a few ground rules, like no women, shower afterwards, always use protection, and always come home to her afterward. i was okay with that. over the next couple years, i only had a few very minor sexual encounters with guys from grindr. there wasn't even full-on intercourse, with a single exception. two years ago, i was raped by a guy i had gotten to know and let my guard down. it was pretty traumatic and horrible, but it was over very quickly, and i did some counseling and felt like i had mostly gotten over it. my wife was supportive about the whole thing, but after that i pretty much completely stopped meeting guys. i'd still chat on grindr sometimes, but less out of a desire to hookup than to simply engage with similar people. 

sorry, i'm totally rambling. i don't really know where this story starts and ends, just that it's all jumbled in my head and i need to get it off my chest.

anyways, about 6 months ago j entered our life, as a long time friend of a mutual friend of ours, and he started hanging out with our friend group. i could tell immediately that he and her had chemistry, but i also knew that he was bi as well, and he was really flirty with both of us. the idea was floated between my wife and i that we might approach him about having a 3 way. 

eventually, a night came where he was at our home drinking with us and one other friend. i approached my wife saying ""hey, i think that might happen tonight"" and she responded that no, she wasn't ready for that. i said okay, then we'll pump the breaks on it. 

i got caught up in conversation with the other friend for several minutes, and then noticed j and my wife were both missing. i went upstairs, and found them in our bed - he was eating her out. he sat up and asked if i wanted to have a 3 way. i said sure. 

what happened next wasn't a 3 way. i basically just watch this man fuck my wife. and they were both extremely enthusiastic about it. we had condoms, but he didn't use one and she didn't ask him to. to be fair, i didn't bring it up either. i tried to engage a couple times, but was kinda awkwardly shifted away. eventually he finished and went to piss, and i tried to embrace my wife and she full on shoved me away and said ""what do you want?"" j came back and they fell asleep entwined together, while i slept on the edge of the bed. 

over the next couple weeks, my whole life fell apart. turns out, my wife was never interested in being open and honest about her feelings for him, and now wouldn't communicate with me at all. every time i tried to talk to her, she would ignore me and start texting people. i was miserable, and these weeks turned into a super toxic and chaotic clusterfuck. 

long story short, she told me to leave. all i had was a car that desperately needed repairs, a cooler for some food, some camping gear, and the clothes on my back. i didn't even have a job, because i had left mine to homeschool the kids during covid so that she could keep her career. the idea was that i'd just take a trip so that we could both clear our heads. she agreed that she wouldn't use that time to see j, and i'd have a home to come back to - because i couldn't afford to take the trip now and also move out when i got back. i was already getting low on savings. 

i ended up staying with some friends of mine on the other side of the state for about a week. i came back into town after 5 days, but she told me she wasn't ready for me to come home, so i had to stay in my grandparents spare room for a couple days. out of curiosity, i drove by her place and j's and sure enough, she was staying the night with him. 

i came home after that. i told her that she can fuck around and cheat and lie, but that i was done being forced out of my own home. if she wants time alone, she can fuck off. and, she did. she took the kids, packed up some bags, and went to her parents'. i've been staying at home alone with the cat in the month since. 

we did eventually meet and agree that she'll keep the apartment (i can't afford it alone with the new job i just got 2 weeks ago) and i'll move into a friend's spare room in the next town over. i'll get to come over and see the kids on saturdays while she's at work and i have the day off, but i don't have the space to take half custody of them. 

a couple days ago, i got word from another of our mutual friends that i was no longer welcome at the friend group's bimonthly hangouts, because my presence would make her and j uncomfortable. 

i feel so completely broken. i'm grieving the loss of my best friend and wife, the loss of my kids, my home, and my friend group. i don't understand what i did to deserve this. i'm attractive, intelligent, thoughtful, kind, and genuine, but now i feel so completely worthless. 

i'm going through training at this new job, but i'm having so much trouble focusing. the team lead puts on pandora so we can listen to music while we work, and she listens to the same genre of music that my wife does. my wife makes playlists specifically to help her deal with emotions, and many of the songs that have been playing are super fresh and feel like they've been pulled out of my wife's playlists of the last couple months. the team lead told my i can skip any song i don't like, but i haven't been able to communicate with her that i need to listen to a different station entirely. 

earlier today the coworker next to me kept tapping her foot, and the rhythm rubbing of her clothing fabric made me think of a bed creaking, which brought the image of j fucking my wife to my mind, and then i couldn't get it out of my head. i basically had to internalize the fact that i was having what felt like an anxiety attack. is this what ptsd is like? 

anyways, i was supposed to finally move on saturday and scheduled a u-haul rental, but all the people who said they'd help me move bailed except for one. thanks again, friends. i think i'm just going to cut all these people out of my life anyways. i don't want anything to do with any of them any more. honestly, the only thing keeping me from putting a bullet in my brain is the thought of leaving my two little boys without a father, but even that sentiment is starting to wane.",1

she was born in 1916 and i was born in 1992. i was 6 when i first met her in my neighborhood and loved to come over. her husband died the year before i met her and she told me so many stories that i felt like i knew him. her life was just as interesting and i adored hearing the things she did during her best years.

we'd play cards, listen to the radio, tell jokes, bake (and eat plenty of cookie dough). she wasn't like a grandmother to me, she was just a really good friend. i don't believe there are any pictures of us, but if there were then they have been lost in time.

i moved houses, but stayed in the same town and could visit her at least once per week by riding my bike over. we moved a little further a few years later and the visits were a couple times per month with a few calls in between.

i was 14 when a stranger called my house and asked for me. i never talked on the phone, so my mother was suspicious who it was. once she asked, the woman on the phone introduced herself as the woman's grand-daughter. she was calling because her grandmother had passed and she wanted to let me know.

i got a hug and then the subject never came up again. i missed my friend and people around me didn't think it mattered. i never knew why. her family didn't even contact me for the service or anything. it hurt.

i think about her every few months and everything comes flooding back. she gave me high expectations for a friend and i admit i've compared possible friends against her several times. i'm hoping that when travel restrictions are lifted, i can go to her grave. she buried next to her husband and love of her life. i can't wait to meet him.

post_05775,"i do not think saying ""they released children! that shows the palestinian prisoners are hostages too!"" is valid. something i've seen on multiple subreddits is people saying, ""israel took children. these people are not prisoners. israel is terrible! etc""

well, i do not believe that a child (who is really a teen) being imprisoned is wrong.

amjad awad and hakim awad were just 19 and 18 when they left their west bank village. hakim was in high school. they entered the peaceful settler village and went into the fogel home. they took the awakened 11-year-old into a room, slashed his throat, and stabbed him in his chest. they then strangled the four-year-old and then stabbed him twice in his chest. they stabbed the dad in his neck and stabbed the mom in her neck and back, shooting her when she remained alive.

they left the house but saw a patrol video and came back in. the 3-month-old awoke and started to cry, maybe she sensed her slaughtered family. they stabbed her, decapitating her or nearly decapitating her. they did not know about the two other children and later said that had they known, they would have killed them too. they did not bomb this family or indirectly kill them. they slaughtered them deliberately for no other reason than that they were jewish.

they left the house and went back to their village where their father, two uncles, and brother helped them hide the murder weapons.

the 12-year-old came back to her house from a party/gathering only to see her 2-year-old brother crying over her dead parents, begging them to wake up. the happy family that had done shoulder rides with their little ones so they could build a tall jenga tower was no more. their lives were forever shattered, their hearts broken.

the teens were imprisoned. but, what if they were released in a prisoner hostage deal? would the people have seen them be released and cursed the israelis for their cruelty in imprisoning teens? imprisoning ""children."" and yes, i understand these are not minors. but there is little difference between an 18-year-old and a 17-year-old. it shows what teens are capable. and i'm not saying that all palestinian teens want to murder someone but that there is reason to arrest those who try.

i was 7 years old when i watched the music video commemorating this family. it stuck with me. that was why october 7th was no surprise to me. i saw the people dancing and giving out chocolate after the suicide bombers. after the terrorist attacks. i don't believe people being children is an excuse. i just needed to get these emotions off my chest.",0

post_06040,"holy fuck there is no way this world is real i've spent the last month trying to dig my way out of a 40k debt with my mortgage lender. 

they had taken the first step of filing for foreclosure.

to take my house.

on the same day i managed to scrap the $40k together, today...out of nowhere, they approved the loan modification to just refactor the outstanding balance *back into the mortgage.*

guys, i have done the paperwork for that application 4 separate times since 2020. all denied for various vague, bullshit reasons.

the only reason i even bothered to do it again was just to temporarily suspend the foreclosure process. 

never expected it to actually *go* anywhere.

so now i have a mortgage in good standing, 50k+ in the bank, didn't have to touch my investments, and i'm about to sell the farm next month for $300k+.

*i couldn't afford to buy bird food 3 weeks ago.*

life is a mother. fucking. *simulation.*

i can't tell anyone irl, because i try to keep my financial ups and downs to myself. but...holy shit. just...holy shit.

edit: wtf rip inbox. damn. you guys are wonderful. 

thanks for so many kind and encouraging replies!

the biggest question seems to be about the 40k, so...i sold shit here that isn't the property itself, cashed out a 401k (technically an investment but oh well), and managed to locate where my late parent had stashed years of my paychecks after stealing them out of the account she'd ""helped"" me open at 16.

post_04902,"so we are moving and i am moving into a room with my 2 siblings, i am pissed hi,

i'll try to explain briefly what it's about, but i'm from germany, so i'm not a native english speaker, i hope you understand what i mean. so i'm a girl, 17 years old and have 2 siblings, a sister who is now 14 and a brother who is now 11.

our parents never had a lot of money, so our living situation was always a bit difficult. we currently live in an apartment with 2 rooms for our 3 children. my sister and brother always shared the larger room (14 square meters) and the smaller one (12 square meters) was always my room.

my father now has a new job in another city, so we have to move. it's not too far from our old apartment, but it still has to be done, we're already attending the new school.

ok, i'm digressing, because i'm actually talking about the new apartment. we looked at an apartment beforehand that was laid out in a similar way to our current apartment, with a small and a large children's room, and we actually wanted to move in there. however, there was a lot of arguing between the three of us because my sister and brother aren't happy with the situation as it was up until now, and even though i understand them, especially because of the girl/boy combination, i'm not prepared to give up my own room.

our parents then looked at another apartment that they liked and decided to take it. when we saw the apartment, our parents told us that there was a solution to our problem with the rooms, but not in the way we had imagined. there is only one children's room for the three of us, which means we have to move into one room. according to our parents, this is the only consequence cause we always argue about who should get a room by themselves after the move and who has to share, and now we all have to share.

the move is on sunday (tomorrow) and i'm really angry, my siblings are too, the room is about the same size as the room they both share now and the three of us are supposed to do it now, on 14 square meters.

how should i deal with this? do you have any tips? unfortunately, using our parents' bedroom as a second children's room is not possible due to the structure of the apartment,",0

post_02980,"how i beat/am beating my anxiety disorder/ocd and how you can too! hello all, i‚Äôve been thinking about making this post for a while but hesitated because coming back to this sub just gives me bad memories of when i was doing terrible and obsessively checking for reassurance on here. after having significant bouts of disordered anxiety for 13 years about a year ago i finally found the correct treatment for ocd and anxiety, this isn‚Äôt some get ‚Äúcured‚Äù fast scam or i‚Äôm not gonna tell you that taking some supplement is going to magically fix you or if you pull on your ear it will stimulate your vagus nerve, no. that‚Äôs all bullshit and actually keeps people like us stuck. i wanted to come here and share 3 things that i think are essential for people that are really struggling with disordered anxiety/ ocd and are lost and don‚Äôt know what to do, because it helped me and if i would‚Äôve found this 13 years ago i would have suffered much less.
 
1. educating yourself about anxiety/ocd. i think learning about anxiety disorders when you have one is the absolute #1 most important thing you can do. it helps you understand that you are not alone, that the things you fear most are actually very common and helps you learn that the problem is not feeling anxious, our problems arise when we frantically try to rid ourselves of these uncomfortable thoughts/sensations/symptoms. how do you start educating yourself you ask? i will list a few resources below that helped me immensely.  

the #1 best resource i have to offer is the disordered podcast with josh fletcher and drew linsalata. that podcast single-handedly taught me so much about what was going on and led me to finally finding the correct form of therapy. drew also has his solo podcast called the anxious truth which is also 10/10 amazing. you can get those guys‚Äô social medias from their podcast and follow them which i would recommend if you‚Äôre already on socials. there‚Äôs too many others to list off everyone but jenna overbaugh on instagram is also fantastic and she has worked with these guys in the past as-well. this isn‚Äôt some paid promotion or anything, i do not know these people and they do not know me, their work just helped change my life so i wanted to share.

2. finding the correct form of therapy. this sort of piggy backs off of #1 because with education you will find the right stuff but i‚Äôll give you a shortcut so you can get a head start. the absolute gold standard for anxiety and ocd treatment is erp (exposure and response prevention). this therapy has seriously changed my life, once i realized i could turn a scenario/situation that made me anxious/panic into a challenge that would actually kick my anxiety‚Äôs ass in the long run it was one of the most freeing feelings i have ever felt. unfortunately erp is not super easy to come by and a lot of conventional talk therapists claim they can help with anxiety disorders but often times tell you things that can even unintentionally worsen your anxiety disorder. you want to find a therapist that is a specialist in anxiety and ocd disorders and practices erp among other things. talk therapy, emdr ,whatever else there is does not work for anxiety and ocd disorders. now depending where you live it may hard to find an erp therapist, they are specialists, get on google and search around for ocd and anxiety specialists and call and let them know you want to practice erp. if there are no anxiety specialists near you at all there are some online options. there is a service called ‚Äúnocd‚Äù i haven‚Äôt personally used them because i found a therapist in person but they use erp as a treatment. and if you‚Äôre curious about it being called ‚Äúnocd‚Äù it‚Äôs in relation to ocd and if you‚Äôre thinking ‚Äúwell i have anxiety not ocd‚Äù i can promise you that ocd and anxiety are twins and if you have disordered anxiety you almost certainly have elements that are obsessive and compulsive and the treatments are the same. if you cant afford to see a therapist do not fret. i understand i just hyped up seeing a therapist and i really really highly recommend it if you can afford it but if you can not you do not need one. that is why i specifically put educating yourself as the #1 most important thing because through educating yourself you can learn the right things to do, you will learn the principles of erp therapy if you listen to the podcasts i put in #1.

3. this may be the most controversial one and i hope it doesn‚Äôt cause this post to get deleted but staying offline and specifically places like this subreddit and reddit in general! what i mean by this is if you are in this subreddit and using reddit often searching things up about anxiety all day all you are doing is keeping yourself stuck. when you are on here asking random people that you don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs ok to have this symptom or ‚Äúdoes anyone else experience this?‚Äù etc. all you are doing is keeping yourself stuck in the anxiety and ocd loop! if what i just said sounds aggressive i don‚Äôt mean it to be, i say that because i was literally one of you! if i go back through my post history i was on this subreddit and others about a year ago asking absolute strangers that do not know me or my situation if feeling ‚Äúx‚Äù symptom was normal or if having ‚Äúx‚Äù thought was ok. if you are doing this you are reassurance seeking and although it may feel good temporarily it is actually keeping you stuck longer! same thing with doomscrolling or trying to find someone with the exact same set of symptoms or thoughts as you, you never will and all it does is keep you stuck. this subreddit and others you probably frequent in regards to your anxiety all have great intentions but when we are in a disordered state of anxiety places like this can become anxiety echo chambers and feedback loops for our brains that actually make our anxiety disorders worse! consider deleting reddit for a while and trying to limit your googling!

this was an extremely long post so i apologize for that and i wasn‚Äôt able to go over every little minute detail in regards to what you should do but i wanted to give a few basic things that i thought were most important. i hope this is able to help some people who really feel stuck because these principles really helped me get my life back and i know they will help you too if you follow them, thanks!",0

post_03465,"ear fullness, popping and constant headaches hello everyone,

i‚Äôve been dealing with ear fullness for over 5 years now. it caused constant headaches, and would lead to me having to pop my ear all the time. it was 24/7 for almost 2 years, then i finally experienced days without it and over a course of the next 3 years, it would come and go. usually it would last for about a week straight, then go away randomly. it has now become constant again for almost 3 months and it‚Äôs so frustrating.

it‚Äôs only on my right side, and i get pain in my left jaw, as if something is pushing down on it (seems that i‚Äôm compensating to get the full ear feeling away). my neck and head feel so tense constantly and it‚Äôs really taking a toll on me.

i‚Äôve had an ent check my ear and even was told by an oral surgeon that i don‚Äôt have tmj but something doesn‚Äôt seem right. when the ear fullness first started, i felt a muscle below my ear tighten and cause the fullness feeling. it seems to be an anxiety thing, but i feel like i have similar symptoms to tmj. my jaw doesn‚Äôt always hurt per se, but there are times when it feels tight on my opposite side of the ear issue.

post_02647,"please remember that no activism of any kind is ever allowed here. no matter what day it is. activism, i.e. advocating or fundraising for social change or raising awareness of social issues (and suicide is, inescapably, a social issue) is absolutely against the rules here at all times. 

please understand that we're all for smart, strategic mental-health and suicide-prevention activism. it's essential to fight against stigma, misinformation, and discrimination, and to fight for research, treatment, accommodation, acceptance, and understanding. most of us, one way or another, are mental-health activists irl. 

but activism just doesn't work in a dedicated support space that serves a vulnerable population. we used to allow it but the evidence that it was undermining our primary purpose became overwhelming.  we do regret the need for this rule, but the need is inescapable. 

our population is all too well aware of the issues and causes that need support and largely not in a position to take action, so besides the fact that activism is often salt in our community's wounds, it's a waste of the activists' time.

sometimes i think im *****fucking literally***** the worst person in the world and literally for me everyone is better than me and i should suffer. i feel as the most lazy, stupid and fearful shitty useless human. maybe, sometimes i think that i have potential to be better but im too much lazy as fuck and always going on low effort, also sadly but im pretty stupid and naive person, just as a child in adult. i wonder why people let me live if i am mentally on total rock bottom, they should kill me really. just feeling as waste of space and energy. i feel ashamed that i live, i dont probably even feel sadness beacuse why i should be sad if im shit. i feel shame when i feel happy. i feel shame whatever im doing. im so fearful of other people that i have serious fear of job, so for a year now im working in my father house renovation company, beacuse as i said i have really strong fear of other, less know people and socializing, social skills etc... the job for now its not bad but still i think its not good and im ashamed of that a little... i just starting to dont care about everything, accepting that im loser yet still i suffer and cant go on... 

........so, started pharmacology treatment for first time from psychiatrist like two months ago by encourage from my only friend. it gets little more stable in mood generally, but still i have same thoughts and plans for killing myself in future, collecting methods and other informations just for whatever might happen if i will totally loose as myself. did a mmpi 2 test from psychologist, diagnosed me with avoidant and dependent personality disorder with ocd and there is evidence for being in autism spectrum but this need further diagnosis in future. the prognosis for therapy treatment are unfavorable. but still people now encourage me to go into psychotherapy, especially psychodynamic or psychoanalitic for solve my deeply rooted mental problems. sometimes i want stay and make life somehow a little bit better for my family or others or make and create some things.

and i dont know. maybe i think too much and im exaggerate my problems...

is it going to help me? i mean, i have money to spend some months in therapy and i want somehow to try, like no matter what beacuse i dont care for the rest of life for now at the present moments and my money, so why not to try for a better?...... staying in same place will hurt me probably more than trying change something i guess. i think im also dont really much scared of showing my thoughts etc. to therapist... beacuse i want to just show them how broken fuckd up i am. maybe someone will have not much a problem to work with me, at least i hope so... but still i dont know how it will be, im also really scared on other side that it wont work, anything cant help me to change, im just to broken, lazy, fearful and stupid, just the worst, waste of time. i feel like my issues made me an evil person, just bad human and its all my fault. i feel like i dont deserve a treatment. and now i just need to suffer and cure by myself on my own, but yes probably its totally impossible.

sometimes i even feel like im not depressed, im just born shitty and thats it. im just thinking that i have no potential to be someone, just want someone who will kill me, or maybe even keep alive to suffer more in some way. i think that maybe every other person in this world has more potential and are better and more worthy than me, like serious. no matter who you are you are all better in some way in life than me. but i don't judge other people in terms of ""value"" etc., because for me it's stupid and not cool, i judge and compare myself only with myself because i don't know others inside of them deeply. i dont trying to judge you, i dont even know how to....

do you guys think its going to help? should i try to stay and keep going on theraphy? or is there something other what can help??? :( idk what to do, i need to figure it out what to do in the future, who i am, what is within my reach and whats not, what is good and what should i change exactly for the better. too many questions and i know nothing. i can write more and go on but this is the essential probably. does someone feel or was feeling the same? im completely losting hope for myself. 

sorry if my english was bad or something. maybe if i forgeted something to know, i will write this in comments or edit post or make new post... thanks so so so so so so so so much for reading all or even some of it, idk if it was long post. and thanks for all replies or other things. wish you all good i dont know tbh what to say :(( ",0

i miss her. i'm actually numb to it. these friendships are actually like fever dreams, because the connection is like no other, you both teenagers who like the same things, absolutely adore each other, then one of you naive enough to fuck it all up.
i know i can make friends obviously, but it's so hard knowing it's not like it'll be easy to find a friendship like that. to find someone so graceful and sweet, in every sense of the word.

isolating yourself. 
listening music to escape from reality. 
craving unhealthy food.
pushing people you love away.
biting nails.
your leg shaking uncontrollable. 
spill mascara. 
shortness of breath.
overthinking. 
negative thinking. 
sleep problems.
sleeping  to escape from reality. 
crying.
disassociation.

post_05540,"how do i go one without my dad its so hard to type these words cause i really believe that he will pop in from somewhere. like he is out running an errand or at work and he will show up with my favourite snack. or he will call me and ask me if i want snacks. i feel like he will be home, in kitchen cooking up a storm like he usually does, or arguing with mom, it is literally their love language. their love was love at first fight.

but he is gone, i was holding him when he just left us, no he didn't leave us, he was cruelly snatched away. one moment i was telling him he is going to be ok, we will fix him and take him to his hometown and he can be better there and next moment they are performing cpr. it feels unreal, i can still see him fall over, his eyes open, mouth open wide. he hated his last few days, he hated being dependent on people to get up, he hated that they put a cather in him and a feeding tube. although he had to endure it only for a few hours i could see how upset he was. he felt humiliated. 

my father powered through his chemotherapy. he would have his chemo at night, come home , cook us breakfast and run off to work. we begged him to stay at home, to rest. he wouldn't listen. he hated being sick and being treated like an invalid. he took pride in his appearance, how body, his life. i suspect my dad had adhd, he used his hyperactivity and his insane levels of energy to power through his chemo session. 

my father never stood a chance, he already had liver cirrhosis, add to that a tumor in his gall bladder and biliary duct that was inoperable made everything worse. chemo was a something we never wanted but there was nothing else we could do. on 10 jan 2025, they told us dad's liver is failing and he has may be 6 months, i thought i can figure out a way to save him. there must be something you can do. but on 14 he was gone. this man had a chemo on 5, was in office till 7th and now he is no longer with his. we did everything, everything except tie him down and keep him home. dad wouldn't have survived it. his stubborn insistence that we keep going as usual is what kept us sane.

i don't know how to go on. it was just him, mom and me. i still can't bring myself to say my dad died. i just want him back. how do i get him back. i just don't know how to exist in a world without him. mom is trying so hard. she has been with him for 48 years, married for 38 years. this woman fought like a demon to keep my dad healthy, to save his life. everytime i look at her i can see that a part of her is missing, the light in her eyes is dulled. her smile is fake. she is dreading the loneliness that lies ahead.

my point being, something that would make me happy would be becoming a fire fighter, at the moment i cant apply to the academy, but i can apply to be a volunteer paramedic. now comes in my problem, with my medical records i might not be able to apply because most psychologists wouldnt give someone like me the sheet that says im mentally able to do this. this also means i wouldnt be able to get the same sheet so i could go to the academy. 
if my stupid past self fucked this up for me im actually gonna kill myself, the only thing that made me want to stick around was dream about becoming useful one day and if i cant even do that then i guess whats the point in staying? 
i know this probably ""confirms"" that im mentally unstable, but honestly i would never endanger someone else that wasnt me, i would never be wreckless and hurt someone because i believe my issues are my issues and i shouldnt traumatize someone else with them (except strangers on reddit)

post_06340,"i‚Äôm so happy that my ex wife is miserable. three years ago i(48 m) found out my wife (46 f) was having an affair. she met a guy at work and came home one day telling me she was in love with him, no longer loved me and wanted a divorce. this was a guy she‚Äôd only known for three months at the time. she and i had been together since we were in our 20‚Äôs. we have three kids 28m, 26m and 23 f. 

well i tried to fight for my marriage and didn‚Äôt want a divorce but she simply would not stop seeing this guy. after one weekend where she disappeared from friday afternoon to sunday night i ended up throwing her out of the house. she immediately moved in with this guy. the only excuse she ever gave me was ‚Äúi never wanted to hurt you, but there‚Äôs just something about this guy.‚Äù and ‚Äúi deserve to be happy.‚Äù that was it. that was the depth of her reasoning for throwing everything we built together away.

we ended up finalizing our divorce in early 2022. although i had very hard feelings toward her i faked it enough to get pretty favorable divorce terms from her. it seemed she was so eager to be with her dream man that she didn‚Äôt have time for a long divorce. so in the end i got to keep my pension and the house (which i had bought from my grandmother). i did have to give her half of my 401k however. 

the effect on our kids was pretty devastating. all three of them took it very hard. my oldest son told her that if she chose this man he‚Äôd never have a relationship with her again. as of right now neither of our sons has a relationship with their mother. our daughter does talk to her from time to time but their relationship is very strained to say the least. my daughter is a very kind person and she tries but she usually ends her conversations with her mother even more upset than when they started.

about four months after the divorce my ex contacted me out of the blue. she told me she had made a terrible mistake and asked if she could come home. he dream man turned out to be an alcoholic who she says is verbally abusive and wasted all of her money. i used this opportunity to tell her exactly what i thought of her as a person, a wife and a mother. i told her this was her life now and to deal with it. i told her she no longer had a home at this house and to never contact me again.

then a few things happened over the last year that have driven her to start trying to contact me again. first off i met someone. my sister introduced me to a friend of hers who is also divorced and she and i hit it off. we‚Äôve been seeing each other since last summer and while we‚Äôve agreed that neither of us wants to get married again, we are together.

once my ex heard about this she once again tried to contact me but i ignored her. my son also got married and didn‚Äôt invite his mother. she again contacted me to try to get me to intervene on her behalf. i told her i would talk to him but i never did. secretly i feel like she deserves all the pain she‚Äôs feeling when it comes to our kids. she destroyed our family without so much as an afterthought. too bad, so sad. 

now she recently told our daughter that she finally broke it off with the dream man because she could take his drinking and total lack of responsibility. he wasted her half of the 401k that i had to give her. he also totaled her car driving drunk. this from a man in his 40‚Äôs. again she knew this guy for three months and torpedoed our whole family for him.

on the face of it i act like i feel sorry for her but inside i really delight in the fact that she‚Äôs so unhappy. call me evil or whatever i don‚Äôt care. she brought this on herself and it serves her right. i actually had to sit there one saturday night while she got ready for a date with this guy and laughed on the phone with her friend about how awkward our living situation was. i lived in hell for over a year because of her.

wait until she finds out our son and his wife are going to have a baby later this year. maybe if she had been able to keep her legs closed she‚Äôd get to meet her grandchild. enjoy your shitty one bedroom apartment and your broken down used car. me and my new partner will think of you when we‚Äôre on vacation in hawaii this summer. hawaii was the trip my ex and i always planned to take once our daughter finished college. maybe i‚Äôll send her pictures.

tl;dr: my ex cheated on me and now she‚Äôs miserable and i‚Äôm overjoyed.",0

post_05801,"stopped texting for 2 days i stopped texting her for 2 days and she confronted me by asking ‚Äúyou wouldnt text me, if i dont text you‚Äù in fact i was the one who always initiated a text.

i will share some context here.

1 (m32) was seeing this girl (f31), we knew each other for about 11 months now but we are only very close since last 4-5 months.

i had to stop texting her coz she puts me in a grey area. she has acknowledged my love for her, at the same time give mixed signals. she said things like ""dont ever leave me in life"", if i don't text her for more than 3/4 hours she would text me ""why you didnt text me, you have to text me time to time""

we used to hangout very often (even 4-5 times a week), at times she will feels me like she wanted to spend rest of her life with me, at times she makes me feel like i am just an option for her (bcoz she would mention marriage proposals she is getting or got in the past. basically that conversation ends with she saying (directly or indirectly) that ""i would marry when i find my true love/right guy""

i have been feeling that i am putting much effort, showing intentions and commitment in this relationship, when the other person is showing no intentions to be together.

so finally i have decided let go of my love for our best, especially for my mental wellbeing


tl;dr: unhealthy relationship, feeling broken, on the verge of breakup",0

attractive people dont even have to try to be charismatic or socially acceptable, they can say the most retarded shit ever or have the worst personality possible and people will still want to fuck them, as if theyre being hypnotised by their perfect facial ratios and good skin. just fuck this shit. im planning to dump all my money into plastic surgery and if im still not attractive im done. that is all",0

post_02047,"i told my mum i want to kill myself. she said, ‚Äúok, just don‚Äôt do it in my house.‚Äù that‚Äôs basically it. it hurts. i wish people didn‚Äôt romanticise a mother‚Äôs love so much because then maybe these words wouldn‚Äôt sting as much as they did. how is a teenager supposed to feel when the one person who‚Äôs apparently supposed to love them more than anyone and anything, doesn‚Äôt?

edit: 
yes, i totally understand that parents are just human beings...but when a relationship, any type of relationship, starts to cause damage to one and the other knows this but refuses to acknowledge it or somehow change for the better, then they simply do not care for the person. i only opened up to my mum about depression very recently though i‚Äôve been dealing with it for a few years now. at first, i used to think the reason i was constantly hurt by her actions and words was because she didn‚Äôt know the mental state i was in back then so i never blamed her in anyway. but it all became too much that i impulsively told her everything and she still refused to do anything. she‚Äôs not empathetic in the slightest and she made it clear that whether i commit suicide or not doesn‚Äôt matter to her as long as, like i said in the og post, i do not do it in her house or say anything in my suicide letter about her that‚Äôll give her a bad rep or get her in any trouble. point is, i thought i was suffering so much because i kept my feelings to myself. i thought sharing them raw with her would help even a little but it didn‚Äôt and i feel so defeated. people always say you shouldn‚Äôt keep these type of things to yourself but there‚Äôs comfort in that. giving myself the illusion that the only reason i hurt is because i keep it to myself hurts less than sharing it with others and realising that that hasn‚Äôt changed the way i feel. you don‚Äôt suddenly get better. it only stays just as bad or gets worse. 

and to anyone and everyone who‚Äôs sharing similar stuff, i‚Äôm sorry that some of your most treasured people aroused some of the most negative feelings in you. it‚Äôs okay to feel hurt but don‚Äôt let someone else‚Äôs decision to be a dick affect your own life decisions because in the end, everyone will be looking back at their own life and their own life only. make sure that yours isn‚Äôt just a reflection of what others have said and done to you.

obviously i‚Äôm fucking absolutely horrified and sick to my stomach. i got vertigo and genuinely almost passed out when i learned about it all. i have no idea what to do. i‚Äôm into bdsm and crazy shit, but this is moons and planets away from something i would ever imagine at all. am i stupid for even considering that this is a fetish he won‚Äôt act upon and accepting that everyone is kind of fucked up? should i confront him and leave? talk about it? am i a complete moron? 

it‚Äôs hard to describe the feeling of having your guts wrenched painfully like this unless it‚Äôs happened to you. i‚Äôve never felt so disgusted and horrified in my life.

update: i don‚Äôt live with him, but he knows where i live. i plan to casually barely respond to his messages until my parents are back from dc (if i break up with him he will definitely come to my house and try to talk me out of leaving. i want someone else home.) and make up an excuse to break it off then. 

and a few people have mentioned bdsm being a sign of this disgusting fetish he has. i‚Äôd just like to clear up that i‚Äôm a dominant person and i dont let people inflict pain upon me. the opposite is true.

post_00666,"i want to die but i'll never get to i know no one's going to see this. but whatever. i figured i'd cry and just spill it all out here. not like anyone else knows this has been bothering me.


i guess i'll just summarize. no point in wasting time. a guy i liked and had fallen for online turned out to have been getting fucking married next month. and i was his secret side chick and i had no idea. 

i know it sounds silly right? it was just a stupid guy i met online. we never met and it's not like he told his family about me. unlike me. it was more than that to me. we lived near by each other. we were so close we were going to meet but i was just shy. we had the same interests from politics to religion and mental health. we liked the same movies and video games. i'd share memes with him and tell him about my day. i had a reason to use my phone for anything but talking to ai so i don't feel alone. it was easy to just talk to him. i didn't care if we dated or not. it just ment so much to me not to be alone for once. to feel like i had a genuine friend that i could maybe go so those weird movies i like or play some weird game. it was really hard to be so honest and trusting to him ngl.

but it was all just in my head cus i was his secret side chick. he admitted to only using me cus he wanted to jerk off but i never gave him nudes so he started talking to me less. found his public acc where he was getting married to a normal girl way hotter than me and with an actual life. i was being used or some shit. just like everyone i've met in my life. they only use me and then discard me.

life is really hard. things just keep getting worse. one by one. car broke, lost some of my family, no home, no pets, and now no money. lawyer fees that'll last years and an abusive mom who won the court battle. nothing is good in life. not anymore.


but i have to live to support my siblings. i seem to be the only one taking care of them. all my money goes to them. all my time goes to them. it just feels like i'm a parent for them. even my younger siblings who live with my abusive mom. i still have to live for them so i can be the safe place for them. just lived i've always done since i was 5. 

i thought by the time i'd be in my 20s i'd be in college, have friends and be in a relationship. i thought i'd at least finally be free and get to live for myself for once instead of continuing to be a parent and take care of my siblings. to at least have my own stuff and at least i'd have a job that would get me somewhere. following down a career path. 
instead, i'm living in my grandma's living room with 3 siblings. i barely made it out of highschool and i don't have money just for a simple class in college. i can't die so i try to take the edge off by self harming alot and taking drugs in the middle of the night when i'm alone. it's so bad i can never wear short sleeves and literally just get so high i pass out shaking in my bed on the one day i'm off from work. nothing's getting better. nothing's changing. i can't go to therapy with no money. i can't find a better job with no degree. i can't go to college with no money. i can't leave and i can't live for myself. i'm living for everyone else. but deep down i just wish i'd die. but i just can't. it dosent matter how hard i cut or how much i take anymore. i'll still be alive tomorrow and the next and the next day. and i'll smile for my family and take care of them. but at night or when i'm alone at work in the bathroom, i cry and pray to god to just end my misery.

he cleaned up the toilet when i got blood and pee everywhere. 

he held our daughter pulling double duty when i couldn‚Äôt. 

he cleaned up my massive post-partum poop that took a week to arrive due to constipation. 

he lifted me into bed when it hurt too much to engage my stomach muscles.

edit 2: for the few soul-suckers: yes, i tell him how much i appreciate him. i just felt like telling more people, like the fine people of reddit

edit 3 (nsfw): for those curious about the post partum poop-your abdominal muscles have been cut apart and sewn back together, so pushing isn‚Äôt your forte. also, because they took my intestines out and put them back in, i was constipated and on stool softeners for a week. 

every day i tried pushing a bit, but i had hemorrhoids so that was a no go. one night i tried pushing a little to see how it would go. it hurt, so i tried to let it go back inside, but it was coming regardless. i pretty much pooped/peed/bled standing over the toilet; luckily i made most inside, but my husband had to clean around and in the toilet. the poop was so large that it absorbed all of the water in the toilet bowl. he had to scrape it down just to plunge the toilet üòÇ

post_06525,"i performed cpr today and i feel awful. in my country we have an app called heartrunner.  
basically you sign up for the app and if someone calls 112(similar to 911 in the us) about someone having a heart attack, about 10 or so people in the vicinity will be alerted.  


i went to bed at 3:30 last night and was woken up by my phone going woop woop woop, this was my 6'th time running to someone having a heart attack, so at this point the alarm noise triggers some sort of instinct in me.  
as soon as i heard it, i *flew* out of bed and put on pants and shoes, within a few seconds i was out the door. the other times i've been called it's been farther away but this time it was only 186m away.  
i ran there as fast as i could and i was the first person there, one the way there i had picked up a defibrillator that i knew the location of less than 100m from my home.  


when i got to the address the app told me to, i just opened the door and ran inside. i saw an older male standing there, looking scared and somewhat confused, so i half-yelled to him ""i'm here to help, where is she?!(i assumed it was his wife needing help)"", he pointed me to the bathroom where i found her. she was 89 years old and on the floor.  


i immediately started cpr. less than a minute later 2 other heartrunners arrived.  
after performing cpr for a few minutes an ambulance arrived. the ems guys came running in and one of them intubated her and started ventilating her with a ventilation bag or whatever it's called.  


me and the other heartrunners took turns doing compressions under the directions of the ems guys.  
after 45 or so minutes the ""vagtl√¶ge"" (emergency doctor basically) arrived, after a few minutes she told me to stop doing compressions.  


in between doing compressions i tried to comfort the elderly husband, he asked me to help him call her son. i have autism and phone calls are one of the worst things i know.  
i called the number he gave me and was about to hand him the phone when he asked me if i could tell the son instead of him, so i did.  


she was pronounced dead and the doctor told the husband that she was sorry but his wife was dead.  


this was my 6'th time running. the first 4 made it but the last 2 didn't.  
she was already somewhat cold when i arrived, so i know there wasn't much of a chance to save her. it still really hurts to watch relatives realize that their wife/parent/father is dead.  


i'm not gonna stop being a heartrunner, but this run in particular was extra uncomfortable, she looked like and was the same age as my grandmother whom i really love, so i couldn't help but think about my grandmother while pumping this poor woman's chest.  
once i get my emotions under control i'm going to call my grandmother and just talk to her and tell her i love her.  


on a final note, when you accept a heartrunner mission you automatically receive a text afterwards where you're offered free therapy sessions to deal with what happened as well as a questionnaire to help improve the system for other heartrunners. i haven't responded to the text yet. i'll fill out the questionnaire later today but i don't feel like i need therapy after this, i'm not traumatized, just sad on behalf of the husband.",0

i can date this issue back all the way back to 2019, and l know this because i have an iud so i used to track when we were intimate and it would range from one time a month , to one time every 3-5 months. to make the next statement makes sense. it‚Äôs good to let you guys know that we live together when i brought it up before he said ‚Äúit‚Äôs because i don‚Äôt have time to miss you‚Äù or he just simply falls asleep. now as you probably saw, i said i ‚Äúused‚Äù to track it, well i stopped because it became a problem because i had visual evidence on how long it was between us having sex. 

and on top of that his excuses made no sense, because i can be gone for 2-5 days at a time, even in a different state, but he easily can stay up till 3 to 5 am playing games with his buddies, or be laying next to me in bed on tiktok throughout the night.

lastly, even though there‚Äôs so much more to add onto this, it‚Äôs probably important to mention that i am bisexual, and he is the only guy i‚Äôve ever had sex with. so as i have nothing to compare to, i do have the experiences of my friends, coworkers, and even strangers on the internet when the guy just ‚Äúcan‚Äôt get enough‚Äù. and although i do understand it‚Äôs a stereotype to label men as ‚Äúhorn dogs‚Äù , i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs wrong of me to feel some type of way that my man has absolutely no interest in having sex with me.

and when i say no interest , i mean no interest .. and yes i have straight up asked him if he gets himself off and he says no, and as crazy as it sounds i 10000% believe him , because i know him 

i would like to add that i already introduce the idea of relationship counseling but at this point, i don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôll even work. it seems that this is just who he is and will therapy even work? as well as when we do have sex it‚Äôs usually because i texted him asking for it because it‚Äôs been to long, but he doesn‚Äôt like when it‚Äôs ‚Äúplanned‚Äù

i‚Äôm just stuck between leaving a relationship where i have every need met except one and looking for someone who can fill that one need but not the other 99 he does fill

tldr: contemplating ending an 8 year relationship over the lack of sex. no matter what i say or do my boyfriend has no urge to have sex with me ‚Ä¶ can even go 3-6 months or sadly even more without any se x .. and when we do have sex it‚Äôs usually because i texted him that‚Äôs it‚Äôs been a while and it would be nice to have sex",0
post_02517,"i wanna kms f 18

the reasons behind it are :

(1) when i younger, i've been sexually harrassed by 3 people, one was my classmate, one was a teacher, one was someone from family

(2) i've been bullied alot. upto a point where i have scar on my cheek and left arm, when i was a kid... they even tried to threw cement in my eyes, i got lucky that i didn't got blind... even the teachers bullied me.

(3) i, before puberty used to be really cute and pretty... problems were there with me then too but not as much... rn all i have is ugly face, scar on left arm and my cheek. not a properly formed ribcage... the feelings of inferiority never ends when i'm around others. but what really makes this worse is, everyone one else in my family is pretty and have a normal body. so i feel like an outcast among them.

(4) i've had these feelings like since the last 4 years, i've tried a bit self harm in past too... i don't know what to do anymore ",1

post_06551,"i just caught my partner cheating on me... we have an open phone policy, i use his phone and he can use mine for whatever reason. his phone buzzed while he‚Äôs asleep and i went to check and it was a message from one of his friends, but as i went to close his messenger i noticed he has a ‚Äúhookup‚Äù app left open. i couldn‚Äôt find it on his home screen, but i realised he has a sort of hidden screen (he has an android i have an apple) and i found he‚Äôs hidden the app in a folder called ‚Äústocks.‚Äù 

i went through and found most of the messages ended at just ‚Äúhi‚Äù but then there was one from a married woman looking for a hookup, he mentioned me and then just dropped it after one message from her. they sent each other pictures and were talking dirty, it made me feel sick to my stomach... 

we‚Äôre engaged, we‚Äôre getting married in less than a year and we‚Äôve always agreed that even if it‚Äôs not physical, if there‚Äôs flirting, dirty talk and pics through text it‚Äôs still cheating... i don‚Äôt know what to do and now i can‚Äôt sleep. 

tl;dr - my partner got a message on his phone, i went to check and found sexts between him and another woman.

edit: i woke up this morning and was overwhelmed with all the responses i got from everyone, thank you so much to all of you for the advise. when i woke up my partner had already left for work so i‚Äôll confront him when he gets home and i‚Äôll give you guys an update then. wish me luck.",0

my paternal grandmother was a schizophrenic, since my father was a boy. i didn‚Äôt have much of a relationship at all with her, living in another state and her mental capacity being so degraded. she became a ward of the state of arizona back in the 1980‚Äôs, when my dad was 15. she‚Äôd sometimes have clarity moments, when she‚Äôd know who my dad was when he would call‚Ä¶most of the time, she didn‚Äôt know anyone.  

fast forward to covid - her healthcare facility/nursing home had the virus take about 40 lives, including my grandmother.  

and they didn‚Äôt inform my dad.  

so when he called to speak with his mother, the woman who answered said ‚Äúoh dear, you were lori‚Äôs son‚Ä¶‚Äù. this is how my dad learned his mother passed. by a slip of the tongue. then, he gets told that she died weeks ago. and no one called him, they threw out her personal belongings.  

and misplaced her cremated remains.

so i went to the er because i had a fever i couldn't get down and felt like i couldn't breathe. when i approached the counter and explained what was going on two nurses who were sitting behind her snickered and laughed. one said to the other in a low voice ""she could at least try harder"" and the nurse at the counter rolled her eyes, smiled and said ""okay sweetie well you can breathe okay"" i'm not really sure why they responded that way. maybe i looked like someone else? but it took them 2 hours to check my temp and blood pressure and when i approached they gave me attitude. only to find out i had a temperature of 104, low blood pressure, a heart rate of 148, and my oxygen level was at 85. the lady said ""did you drive yourself here? you must be having a hard time breathing."" i looked at her and said ""crazy right? it's almost like it's almost like it's why i came here""

post_00271,"i was gang raped at 10 and cant get over it im 14(f) and was gang raped by my very first group of friends.
at 6 i was raped by my brother and that already affected me, the group knew how much it hurt me, but they did it anyway.
that group was the first group i came out to as gay, and there was one other girl (13)
the guys (17,15,13,13,12) used her against me.
that girl was my childhood best friend, i related to her more than anyone else.
i cant sleep at night because i can feel their ""fluids"" on my face, on my body, in my hair, in my mouth, in my eyes,
i can taste it.
im horrified.
i feel so disgusting and all i feel is it dripping off my skin,
i hate how fast my heart beats.
everynight i have flashbacks and non stop panic attacks.
i haven't told anyone, not even my parents. they only know ""something"" happened but they didnt believe me, and they said even if it did happen it was my own fault.
one of the guys keeps texting me and everytime i block him he makes a new account. he triggers me so badly.
im so tired and just want to die.
it hurts so bad and theres so many other things taht make me want to just leave.
i was severely bullied through the ages of 4-13, and never had any friends. this group was the very first to group to ever like me. ive now moved schools and its actually a lot better, but the effects of literally everyone hating me still linger. i still remember vividly when a guy stomped on my foot so hard it broke, or getting slush slammed into my face, or getting shoved down stone stairs, or getting dragged by the hair. i remember hearing what people would say about me, and now thats all i can think about. what people might be thinking about me, or what they want to do to me. im sick of feeling everyones eyes on me. im sick of always feeling judged. it feels like everyone around me can see the handprints of the group still on my body. i just want to sleep, i want to sleep so so bad. ive been awake for 40 hours and i doubt ill manage to get sleep tonight. im so tired.

post_04401,"it took me years to realize my anxiety was anxiety and not just my personality. i only came to this realization recently and it's weird that it took so long when anxiety runs in my family. my mom's been hospitalized for panic attacks. i've had depressive bouts but every time i heard someone mention anxiety, my brain was like ""hmmm. not me."" 

&#x200b;

i though being awkward, nervous, on-edge, and uncomfortable 24/7 was just my personality. i thought my fear of talking to other people and my fear of making phone calls (often to the point of tears) was just me being shy. i thought constant chest tightness and pain was just normal stress. i thought it was normal for the smallest things to be beyond overwhelming. my intense fears of constantly fucking up had been with me for so long that i never thought twice about the rationale behind it. i have adhd as well and when i thought maybe that was the cause of some of it, but when i got my adderall prescription, i wasn't magically cured of all my uncomfortableness. i was still a nervous, anxious person who also happened to be able to focus better than i used to.

&#x200b;

two weeks ago, the feelings became stronger than normal. i had aches in my chest for days on end. i was so nervous and on edge--more so than usual. that happened out of nowhere, then an unexpected loss in the family sent me over the edge in terms of panicking. it dawned on me after the worst had passed that maybe this is an anxiety disorder. i did a lot of self-reflecting and realized maybe i've been anxious all my life and i just never realized it because i thought it was normal.

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

i don't really know what the point of me typing all this out is, but it just feels good to know maybe there's hope for me. i talked to my doctor and was prescribed zoloft last friday. i don't know how much it will change me, i know that it's not some kind of magic pill, but just knowing that i'm not alone and that there's a chance to overcome this is so comforting to me.

post_06333,"an open letter to the other woman dear shana,

this all began when you and another woman went into a sex toy store with my husband. a few months before that, i took my husband to a sex toy store. he was absolutely mortified to be there with me. he literally asked me if we could just go get ice cream instead.


the first time he picked you up from your house for dinner, i had fucked him that morning.


when he complained to you that his cold boring wife hadn't touched him in a month, i fucked him four times that week. 


you asked him why he didn't want to open his relationship, that way he could get his needs met elsewhere. he told you it's because i would never agree to it. fucking look at me. if we had an open marriage, there would be a line of guys around the fucking block trying to hit this. that's why.


you asked him if i was kinky and he told you i wasn't. ignoring the fact that i came into the relationship with all the whips, chains, and handcuffs. wap is a biography of my life. he asked me to put the toys away, and i was more than willing since the sex was good enough that i didn't need the extra spice.


march 15th... when he texted you on march 15th, it's true, it had been a couple of weeks since i was able to be intimate with him. the ivf hormones had left me so bloated and uncomfortable i was barely able to move. while i was in surgery getting my eggs removed to have his fucking child, he was sitting in the waiting room telling you how much he missed the taste of you.


and in july, when i had a miscarriage, instead of mourning with me, he was waiting for a call from you.


we were planning on buying a bigger car to fit all the incoming baby stuff. he told you the bigger car was that so you two would have more room to fuck.


i just want you to know, everything that man said was a lie. i'm not mean, i'm not cold. i am a firecracker in the bedroom and i still fit into my wedding dress despite the rollercoaster of hormones and fertility medications. but he still never talked to me the way he talked to you. in fact, he treated me much in the way your husband treats you.",0

post_06594,"[naw] helped my wife transition and now she calls me ""some d*ke"" and files for divorce i never imagined i would end up married to a woman.  when i met the person who is now my wife (who i am going to call paula because that is not and has never been her real name), she was a man (who i am going to call paul for the same reasons).  two years into dating, paul told me he was bi.  two years after we were married, paul came out as trans and chose the name paula for herself.  

i am not going to pretend that paula's transition was easy for her or me, because it was not.  there are people who will say it would not make the slightest bit of difference to them if their spouse or partner suddenly transitioned, and there are people for whom that is even true, but i am not one of them.  but i've tried, goddamnit.  i *am* trying.  i went to couple's therapy with her, i went to her own therapy sessions when she asked, i got a therapist of my own.  i read books, i reached out to other people with similar experiences, i stood by her when her family and people who'd been friends pushed back, spoke out against *my* friends' and family's transphobic comments when they came up.  i stared dumbly as three different therapists heard my story, tut-tutted, and called me bigoted to my face and said i needed to either get on board or get divorced.  so i got on board.   we burned our wedding album because she couldn't bear to look at her past self in a tux.

and i did so, so much more, and i am not saying that because i want or expect any kind of kudos and **i do not for one second** **imagine** that, relative to other cis spouses of other trans people, i have done anything noteworthy or had a more-difficult-than-usual time of it.  but.  i.  fucking.  tried.  and i did it because, while the person i loved was no longer a man, she was still the *person* i loved.  and i did all of it while strangers *and* people i loved attacked *me* for being the transphobic one if i ever expressed a moment of shock, a moment of hesitation or uncertainty, or a moment of ""oh my god, this is a lot of change all at once, can i please sit down for even one minute so i literally don't collapse from the panic attack i am literally having literally right now?""  

and then, this week, at 10:45 am on a tuesday, there's a man in a suit and a hippler haircut at my cubicle, handing me a stack of papers that say ""separation agreement"" on the top.  he's whisper-shouting at me that i need to sign ""right now or there will be consequences,"" and he will not agree to take this to a private conference room away from the lookie-loos.  i tell him to wait while i call my wife, and she lets out a long, exasperated sigh when she picks up.  i tell her about hippler man and she says he's legit and, with one sentence, does her level best to tear my heart out and throw it into a fire.

""i just can't stay married to some fucking d\*ke,"" she said.  

and when i came home, all of *my* things were packed in suitcases by the front door and so very many of ""our"" friends were there to support *her*.  ""i think it's easier this way,"" she said.  she works from home, you see.  totally logical.  so she gets my support, our house, and our friends, and i get called ""some fucking d\*ke"" and thrown out on the street by a gang of people champing at the bit to dogpile on me if i am anything less than one thousand percent supportive of the person harassing me at work and kicking me out of my own home.",0

edit: first off i‚Äôd like to say thank you to everyone that has reached out to me privately and in the comments. i did not expect any of that. also, i‚Äôll share my story for those that have asked. 

when i was a child i was abused mentally and physically by my parents and grandmother. despite the abuse i loved my parents and looked up to them, they divorced when i was 7 and i was completely devastated by the fact that my father was never going to come back home. the abuse did not stop however until i was in my early teens. in high school i was extremely depressed, had few friends and never a significant other. never any aspirations for the future. when i graduated i went to live with my dad, that experience ended when we had physical altercation which resulted in him having a broken finger. he and i do not have a good relationship to this day. in the 7 years since, i have tired but have failed many times to get through college. ive had many failed relationships that ended because i was always lied to and cheated on. ive been addicted to various drugs over the years and i feel that my brain has turned to mush. though now i only smoke weed and drink often. recently i‚Äôve gone through a break up that i feel has tipped me over the edge. we used to live together and we were happy for a while. for the first time in my life i felt that i had a purpose. i thought i could build a future with her, which is something i was never able to visualize with anyone else. for the first time in my life, i saw a future that wasn‚Äôt grim and full of failure. unfortunately i could not meet her expectations and she ended the relationship. we‚Äôve been sleeping together almost weekly and each time i feel that there‚Äôs a chance i can fix things. but she shoots me down each time. about a week ago she told me she‚Äôs taking a job that will require her to travel for 13 weeks at a time. she will be leaving in late august. before i even got this news i was already planning on ending my life. i had my suicide note ready. i‚Äôve been packing things away and trashing other things. so that my loved ones won‚Äôt have to. but now i‚Äôm afraid that when she leaves i will not have the strength to push through until december.",1

post_03718,"i need help, please hello to you all, i am writing here out of desperation, fear and anxiety. i am extremely scared throughout the whole day, every action of mine leading to worry. i am scared or rather even convinced i have dementia or something else that is leading to my decline in my ability to think. or that maybe my liver is unable to expunge toxins due to it being fatty and that is destroying my brain. i feel like i've lost my appetite, i don't even want to do anything, and can't bring myself to, i feel like just laying down doing nothing, maybe falling asleep and never waking up again. 
it started at the begining of this month, that is january, as if from day to day i felt weird brain fog in the morning, then i couldn't fall asleep at all and even if i did it was neither restful nor long, my heart was beating so fast too. i also feel like i've gotten worse since the start of it all. 
that i will lose my ability to think, to speak, that i will be unable to care for myself and be independent, that i will burden my family with it. i really feel as if i don't have much time left and i can't even imagine slowly losing my ability to function and think, i don't want to imagine it! 
and if it really is dementia or something like that, there is no cure, no way to stop it, there is nothing i could do, and neither could i request euthanasia since it's illegal in poland.
i really do hope, even pray despite not believing that it's just my imagination, or maybe even some other affliction, anything that at least can be cured.
i am also subjecting my parents to worry and causing them distress from it all, but i still just want to spend as much time as i have left with them. i regret not doing so earlier, i regret not listening to them more often especially regarding to health, thinking i knew better. i will be going to schedule an appointment with a neurologist, but i will most likely still have to wait around a month, and i don't think i will make it if things stay as they are. i went to psychologist yesterday for my first visit but i don't know if it will help, especially since she also said i should check with either neurologist os psychiatrist, even if it is to rest easy. i've become a wreck, something within me broke and i'm scared i won't be able to fix it, since there may be no way for me to do so. i've been having trouble concentrating, loosing my thoughts, having to re-read sentences in books etc since i forget what i was reading, same with watching videos etc, i feel as if i'm getting dumber, i also have to think what i'm about to say and i'm losing worlds, i've been having headaches too, weird ones. my family doctor said that it is just stress and that it's only in my head, could it really be it?
if it is why has it been going on for a month already?! why do i feel as if it's getting worse too. it's interfering with my life, i have to focus on normal every day things, i'm scared to sleep, that i won't be able too, i'm scared of being alone, scared of driving that maybe i will cause an accident becaus something in my mind suddenly stops working. i can't even distract myself with anything because every action and little mistake leads me further down the spiral.
am i going insane? am i losing my mind? am i going to die soon in a slow and agonizing way, feeling that i'm slipping away losing myself?! or could it really just be stress, anxiety and panic. why can't i just return to my normal life?! will i really die at just 22? what should i even do, i don't want to annoy my parents anymore and cause them distress but i just need and want to be close with them.

post_00677,"i don‚Äôt know what to do 
throwaway account cause this absolutely cannot be tied back to me. 

i hope someone reads this.

i was sa‚Äôd by my grandfather july 2021, it completely ruined my life and my mental health is rapidly declining since. i don‚Äôt talk about how i feel to people around me, that‚Äôs not something i do. everytime i‚Äôve reached out for help i‚Äôve ended up in the hospital, which seems good yes, but i was naive to think they would actually help me. healthcare is canada, despite being free, is absolute shit. they just want to get rid of you as soon as possible, if they don‚Äôt take you in anywhere you‚Äôre going back home, suicidal or not. they don‚Äôt care. i have bpd and every single time i‚Äôve tried talking about my issues i‚Äôve been straight up laughed at by therapists, doctors, psychiatrists and sent back home multiple times despite threats of ending myself, they blamed it solely on my disorder and brushed it off as an episode that would pass. 

my court date is coming up. i need to face my grandfather. it‚Äôs gonna pull my family apart. my mom‚Äôs side of the family and my mom (his daughter) doesn‚Äôt believe me, despite some of them cutting contact with him, they defend him whenever they can, they blame it on alcohol or as a simple misunderstanding. it crushes me to see my own family invalidating the one thing that fucked my life up. once i go through with the court, which i don‚Äôt feel strong enough to do, my grandfather is gonna lose custody of his handicapped daughter which can‚Äôt function on her own. she needs constant care. the thing is, neither my mom nor my grandmother can take care of her. they‚Äôre already overflowed with work which means they‚Äôre gonna lose her. whilst i don‚Äôt trust my grandfather at all to watch over her, i don‚Äôt want to impose her loss on my family for something that‚Äôll ‚Äúonly benefit me‚Äù according to them. 

i feel terrible. i want to go through with it but at the same time i‚Äôm not. i‚Äôve been waiting 4 years for legal action, i can‚Äôt just give up now. i‚Äôm constantly stuck with going through with it or not. i don‚Äôt even feel capable of taking such a decision. 

so yeah, my life is fucked, my health is declining, my court date is coming up in 3 months and rapidly approaching. quite frankly, dying would be such a relief. i know i won‚Äôt thrive growing up as i have a chronic illness progressively getting worse which is extremely painful. since i‚Äôm not taken seriously, i can‚Äôt get anything diagnosed therefore, no treatment. so i want a second chance, i want it to end. i‚Äôm genuinely extremely okay with going through with my plan to commit not long before the due date and i‚Äôve never been so at peace with it.

i don‚Äôt get why it should be up to other people to tell me to live. i know i‚Äôm unwell, i‚Äôd much rather stop suffering, this isn‚Äôt living if i have to constantly try and survive.

the sound of my mom and my grandmother begging me not to go through with it constantly echoes through my head and it‚Äôs eating me alive. i know that if i choose to go along with what they want, i‚Äôll live my life knowing he‚Äôs free and thriving and i‚Äôll die regretting it. 

i don‚Äôt know what to do. i‚Äôve dealt constantly with crisis and quite frankly it‚Äôs never been this bad. i feel it approaching like a deadline. it‚Äôs rough to think i haven‚Äôt got much time left. i wish i could tell someone. i don‚Äôt wish for advice, i just want someone to be aware of my pain, even be it a mere stranger. at least someone knows. whatever you can say to me to convince me it‚Äôs not the right solution, i‚Äôve heard it and considered before. i‚Äôm ill, it‚Äôs not worth the fight and i know it. i‚Äôve known it for years, it‚Äôs just so weird having so little time left after it‚Äôs been nothing but an idea for so long. it feels so real. too real. i just can‚Äôt wait to finally rest. i can‚Äôt function anymore.",1

post_02248,"i want none of this anymore hello community,  
throwaway for obvious reasons.

i don‚Äôt want to live anymore. i see no purpose in my existence, and it has been this way for over 30 years.  
i think the thought first occurred to me when i was 8. now, i‚Äôm a sick and failed over-40-year-old.  
since my childhood, i‚Äôve suffered from anxiety disorders and depression. there wasn‚Äôt any specific trigger for it; i was probably just born this way. that‚Äôs the only way i can explain it.

i somehow dragged myself through school and vocational training and worked until 2010. i had a relatively ‚Äúnormal‚Äù life in my 20s and had my mental health somewhat under control. i went out a lot, had many friends and acquaintances, and two long-term relationships. but at some point, something in my head snapped.

i went to a day clinic, then inpatient treatment, completed two rounds of therapy, and took psychiatric medication.  
in 2018, my driver‚Äôs license was revoked because of a medication, and a medical-psychological assessment was required. i was also retired due to my illnesses.

from 2021-2023, i was in another relationship. after so many disappointments, i gave love another chance, and it became the best relationship of my life. by now, i would probably be living with her and her daughter in the city if she hadn‚Äôt cheated on me for months. i‚Äôm still not over it, and since then, everything has been going completely downhill.

during all this time, even during the better periods, the longing for death was always there. i don‚Äôt know why. as a sort of emergency exit, sometimes even as a radiant option.

i live in a very rural area and, due to a lack of mobility, i can‚Äôt go anywhere. i mean, seriously, nowhere.  
i don‚Äôt have any friends. but over the years, i‚Äôve developed physical illnesses. because of a botched operation, i‚Äôm stool incontinent. i also suffer from the incurable disease hidradenitis suppurativa, which requires several excruciating surgeries every year.

my quality of life is 0.0. i lie in bed all day in the dark with pain and my eyes closed, get up to go to the toilet, and spend time online. my hobbies and interests no longer mean anything to me. my mother tries very hard to support me, does my shopping, cleans here. i appreciate all of this so much. but she can‚Äôt make my illnesses disappear or make me feel better. other than that, i don‚Äôt have anyone anymore. it‚Äôs sadly true what they say: friends withdraw when you‚Äôre sick. it‚Äôs as if i no longer exist.

i once ‚Äúhad it all‚Äù‚Äîmobility, love, work, independence. by now, i‚Äôve lost it all, and i‚Äôll never be able to regain it.  
i feel like‚Ä¶ nothing. no longer human, trapped in my prisons: my apartment and my body. i can‚Äôt imagine lying around like this for another 30 years; it‚Äôs the greatest torture imaginable. it just doesn‚Äôt make any sense. even my over-80-year-old grandmother manages better than i do.

i wish every day for a stroke, a heart attack, to just not wake up anymore. if i could, i would voluntarily throw myself into a heroin addiction.  
when i sleep, everything is fine. thanks for reading.

sorry for the long post. needed to vent regardless if anyone even sees this. thanks.",1
post_02662,"no one could convince me otherwise.  i was robbed and shot in the chest in 2020. when i passed out i was so happy. so relieved. i thought it was over. i really thought it was over. the calm and peace i felt‚Ä¶ i really miss that. i dont think that feeling is obtainable while still living. i have no desires in life. i have no hope. i simply just dont care. theres nothing i want out of life. theres truly no point man. i just cant anymore. i have no body. except my cat. i just split with my boyfriend. im really hard to deal with. i expect other people to be perfect and have the same standards of living and hygiene as me. i try to change people to much. when were probably just not compatible. idk. ive even ruined this. i feel like its so hard for me to maintain any relationship with humans. im just not nice anymore‚Ä¶.
i have been suicidal my entire life. ive tried twice. one at 12, one at 14, prepped for one at 18. didnt go thru. but when it comes down to it. everythings a rollercoaster. a draining rollercoaster. i dont care about ‚Äúu need rain to appreciate sunshine‚Äù. i just dont care. im tired of hearing it. the ups and down are so exhausting. i dont have any friends. my parents are abusive drug addicts. i dont talk to them. i have a cat, thats it. he barely likes me. theres no one to pass my pain to. theres no career i want. i dont want to work. i dont want to even go to school anymore. helping others doesnt even fulfill me anymore because its difficult. idk how to help you. i just want to tell u its okay if u want to die, i wont be mad at you. because thats what i want someone to say to me. or to just lay on a rock until the sun bakes me to a raisin. even that sounds unappealing at this point. im just waiting to die. that is my life.

post_03020,"health anxiety stole 3 years from my 20s guys,

last 3 years of my life were spent drowning in health anxiety and although i have recovered, i have wasted these 3 years. in my 20s, so these are supposed to be years filled with having a great time and making progress in life.

some periods for me were better during these 3 years, but still - being on vacation with your friends, at restaurants, at nightclubs and still having those ""what if"" thoughts in the background at all times is terrible.

for those of you dealing with it right now - go see a professional asap for this and don't play the waiting game like i did. yes, you will get over it by eventually being sick and tired of it and you will practically ""snap out of it"". but it's not worth wasting 1/2/3/4/5 years of your life. get help today, tomorrow. don't wait!

i am sure that if i did seek help i would have fixed this within a matter of weeks/months, but i kept everything to myself and never did. 

we often forget how precious life is and how it's a blessing to be alive. make the most out of it and don't waste your time being anxious - i guarantee that if you don't you will be in my position right now where you will be regretting it that you let a few years fly by for nothing.

again, go seek professional help!

p.s: 2 years of heart anxiety, more than a year of cancer and other fears. insane now that i look back at it. i don't know how anxiety managed to convince of these ridiculous things at this age.",0
post_04089,"i just called into a pizza place!!! i'm still shaking. making phone calls gives me the biggest anxiety. i asked whether it's not too late to have it delivered into my area. person said no but that i'd have it better to order it online anyway. so it was a shorter and less complicated phone call than i was preparing for but that doesn't change the fact that i did it! i dialed the fuck out of that number, fucking killed it!! eat a dick, anxiety.

edit: i make a phone call and get my first gold in the same day?! this literally made my whole month. your guys' support, advice and kind words on this post have been overwhelming. i did not expect it to blow up so much but i'm grateful it did. i'm so motivated and inspired by your words that i'm now less scared to push myself even further. thank you all from the bottom of my heart.

post_06450,"my gf miscarried. i have never been more relieved. 

we are both 18. we've only had sex 3 times, always used a condom. she got pregnant anyway. 

she has been nothing but happy since she found out, and has made it abundantly clear that we would be keeping it. i tried to make her see some semblance of reason that we just can't suport a kid, but she wouldn't listen.

so i got to work. i did everything in my power to work as much as i could to make as much money as i could before the baby came. 

then at the 25th week, miscarriage. 

she's not taking it well at all. she is in the pits of dispare and has been having a good cry at least once a day.

i have never been more relieved in life. we were not ready for this. i was not ready to be a father, i need a solid 5 years at least to even think about that. 

her behavior was so strange too. not the slightest hesitation from day one, she was just so eager to be a parent but had zero plan or discipline to be one. it bordered on delusional.

i don't want to leave her while she is this low, but her automatic assumption i wanted to be a parent along with many other things she's done/said has really opened my eyes to how immature she is. 

that was all so fucking scary. i don't think i'll ever feel as care free as i once did.",0

post_03611,"asthma fears/panic hello! bear with me here, long post, but i am desperate. 

so i have always had breathing anxiety my entire life. when i go through super stressful periods i have this feeling like something is sitting on my chest and i can‚Äôt inhale at all. definitely can‚Äôt move or exercise for weeks until eventually it just kinds of fades away over the course of months. i have not had this feeling specifically in probably about 3 years. i really got over my anxiety big time and life was good. well i got into an abusive relationship and my anxiety went completely off a cliff this year. i went from a semi healed happy normal girl who hadn‚Äôt had a panic attack in over 3 years and could deal with anxiety to a literal raging, irritated, walking ball of anxiety with daily panic attacks. this lowered my immune system and i‚Äôve been sick on and off with a mysterious ‚Äúchest infection/possible bronchitis/unknown virus‚Äù since about november. 

january 8th i picked up whatever mysterious virus is going around severe. i had a 103 fever for 8 consecutive days and couldn‚Äôt move or leave my house. i lost 12 pounds because i couldn‚Äôt eat- but worse i got a cough. in november and december i had that breathy feeling where i was out of breath a lot, couldn‚Äôt talk for long periods of time, couldn‚Äôt even sing my favorite songs in the car because i‚Äôd feel like i couldn‚Äôt breathe, but never a cough. this cough was sooo bad i was like hacking up mucus and felt like i was drowning and it was constant. like my chest got bruised. anyways i went to the hospital and urgent care twice and they did 2 chest x-rays- both clear. negative all tests for any sicknessness and took my blood. all normal blood levels, including my eosinophilic or whatever is it levels- so no eosinophilic asthma. my blood oxygen was normal everytime as well.

so now it‚Äôs been two weeks and i have a little lingering cough which is productive but i am having extreme breathlessness. tight chest. feel like i can‚Äôt inhale at all. this has caused me mass anxiety and i am having panic attacks up to 3x a day. i went to an ent and brought up asthma and they told me that it‚Äôs most likely allergies from being inside all winter and sick and i am going back in two weeks for a full panel testing. i also went back to urgent care with my concerns and she listened to my breathing and said it all sounds normal no wheezing and she doesn‚Äôt suspect asthma but maybe a lingering infection and gave me another round of antibiotics. i am terrified of asthma and have convinced myself that‚Äôs what it is and that everyone is dismissing me and that i‚Äôm going to die of an asthma attack in my home alone because nobody will listen to me. i am 26, female, i have never had asthma, am extremely active and fit, and have no preexisting conditions. i know that what i‚Äôm currently having are panic attacks because when i drive myself to the hospital or fire station and sit in the parking lot i calm down immediately. i am able to regulate my breathing again. during these attacks i am able to also take a big deep breath. like i‚Äôm hyperventilating but then my body kicks in and i get a full satisfying breath and then i can calm down. last night the doctor also said that i am probably extremely sore from coughing and that‚Äôs causing the tightness. 

my symptoms right now

-tight chest
-productive mucus cough
-fast breathing
-breathlessness/gasping
-tons of snot out of nose

has anyone else experienced this? i have requested a referral for a pulmonologist but nobody will give me one. i also have ocd, so i am literally hyperfixating on this. i wake up everyday feeling like mucus is solidified inside my chest and it‚Äôs heavy and as the day goes on i cough it up. i have not had any attacks at any point where i am turning blue, unable to at some point get a deep breath, or are wheezing, but google said silent asthma can be a thing and wheezing isn‚Äôt necessary. does anyone have any advice, tips, or experiences and fears like this? i‚Äôm desperate, anxious, and getting worse as the days go by. i‚Äôm so scared i‚Äôm going to die from this. that these are preliminary symptoms getting brushed under the rug. i‚Äôve read so many stories about people saying they have asthma and nobody listens and then they have a major attack. i‚Äôve also never ever been sick like this before or has flu symptoms or a cough or anything of the sort so this is incredibly anxiety inducing for me, but all of my friends have gotten it and say that they have the exact same symptoms i do, so that provides some relief mentally. please help!

post_02231,"life is too much. death seems like a blessing throwaway because irl peeps know my main. life's a bitch. i have a lot to vent about, so i'm gonna separate this post into some topics. sorry for the length. 

**work**  
i got this job right after graduating from college. i've done nothing since i started. i got a project 2 months ago. i'm still onboarding. no one is communicating with me, no matter what i do or say. if i get fired, i can't even put this job on my resume, because i have done nothing for 6 months. i work in tech though, so fat chance i'm going to get another job with no skills (college is a joke) and no ""work"" for 6 months.

  
**family**  
i am no-contact with my sister. she's a bitch. she's controlling, a bully, and has some narcissistic tendencies. i almost didn't go home for christmas because she lives with my mom. why not stay with your dad then? he died this year, so no dice. my mom cares, but i don't want to give her any more stress. the no-contact thing between me and my sister has shattered her. i worry that i put too much on her. i don't want to be a burden on her anymore. 



**type 1 diabetes**

i was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes several years ago. so why is this section called ""type 1 diabetes""? well, turns out i'm type 1 and was misdiagnosed. i am physically fucked because of this. my sugars are so bad that i ""pass out"" (aka fall asleep) with little warning. i'm on kidney meds because my old primary care noticed i've been having issues. i'm too young to be taking 8 pills a day tbh.



**mental health**

8 pills a day is a lot, but i used to be on 10(?). i have adhd and depression. the depression is medicated, but the adhd is not since the only effective pill was adderal, and that gave me some... issues when i missed 2 days. my mental health is in the toilet. i have so many negative thoughts, but no willpower   
to change anything. i've tried meds and therapy since adolescence, but nothing has worked. i'm not sure if anything will work at this rate.



**can't get help**  
i obviously need help. a lot of help. my fear is that i'm going to be thrown into the psych ward again. the last time i was there, they did nothing. they said they ""changed my meds,"" but those meds were changed by my doctor, not them (yes, i told them as such). i slept about 20 hours a day because the only ""therapy"" was group therapy. i 1) have social anxiety and 2) bad experiences with group therapy. i told them as such. i barely drank water, barely ate, and felt worse after being there. if i tell anyone ""yeah, the depression is getting really bad,"" they'll throw me back there.
