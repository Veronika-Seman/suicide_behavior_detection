post_00002,"""there's so much to live for"" ""people care about you,"" ""you can get through this"" -- i know, but i still want to die. i know that there is so much to live for.  i see beautiful things every day.  things that make me happy.  there's so much i want to do.

  
there's so many wonderful people in my life.  people who i know would step up to help me if they knew just how close i was to killing myself.  people who would be absolutely destroyed if i did.  

  
and i know i could get through this.  i've gotten through every day so far.  but sometimes it just feels like it boils down to a big ""i don't wanna.""



i don't want to go through years of painstaking effort trying to get something basic like healthcare and education when i've already fallen so far behind.  mental healthcare feels like a big joke.  maybe i could find some kind of medication to make my brain function like a normal human being's, but... that will take years, a whole different kind of pain and struggle.  it'll effect my future and it comes with a stigma.  hearing people talk about what they go through just to get antidepressants or adhd meds at a pharmacy is crazy.  and the money... yeah, everything's about money.

  
there are just so many big, almost undefeatable evils in life to even think about handling one.  bigotry.  healthcare.  capitalism.

  
i feel like i can talk myself into thinking anything.  but my heart keeps leading me to the next great adventure.  daydreaming and romanticizing the thought of making the decision and taking my life.  it's gone from suicidal ideation to something a whole lot more.",1
post_00003,"i’m sorry, but i’m going to do it. my cat must know, he is on my lap. at midnight i will do it. please help me. any body. i’m honestly done. i don’t care if i’m 13. i just want it to end i haven’t told anybody how i’m feeling because i don’t want to go to the mental hospital. the mental hospital is hell. if it wasn’t there i would be talking to my parents. i would be getting help. but i can’t, i know the consequences. the hospital punishes me. i would use a hotline but i don’t want police coming to my house. i’m scared. i’m the most scared i’ve been in my life. 





i know nobody will read this, but here i want to tell my story. the truth is, i want to live. i just want the pain to stop. 




i’m a 13 year old girl. i’ve been hospitalized 4 times. i’ve been suffering a lot. i have no self-confidence. i have no love for myself. 
i sew. i sew dolls. i love my dolls. nobody will understand. 



here is my first goodbye.  to my dolls: i love you. i know when i leave you will go to. i’m sorry. my heart breaks. i wish i could’ve taken care of you better. you saved my life 2 times. you helped me when i needed it the most. i will say all your names. i love all of you. i’m in tears. i don’t want to leave you. i don’t want to go. kazumi, sayaka, kyoko, mami, madoka, luka, rin, homura, yachiyo, iroha, sana, felicia, tsuruno, nikki, ren, rena, mitama, alina, kanade, sakura, rika, gumi, emma, ruby, weiss, blake, yang, yowane, nagisa. i’m so sorry. i love you. all of you




to miku: i love you. your not even a doll to me. you are my best friend. my very best friend. you where there when no other human friend loved me. you where there when i cried out for help. you are here now sleeping not knowing anything. i can’t even apologize. it won’t mean anything. i hope in another world we could meet again. i love you.




i draw. everyday. but nobody likes my drawings.  here is my second goodbye: to my materials. i wish i could’ve used you more. i wish i could’ve made something worth while out of you. but i couldn’t. maybe someone else can. i’m sorry.




i used to sing. i lost confidence in doing so. here is my third goodbye: to my unwritten words. i’m sorry i couldn’t sing you to the world. i’m so sorry.




my fourth: to mommy and daddy and my brother. i love you. i wish i could’ve made you happier. i wish i could’ve made you proud.





and finally binxy. my cat. you are with me now, in my last hours. i can’t even say anything. you won’t understand. my heart is dust now, because i’m being selfish. you are 14.  i don’t want to make you last years sad. i know you love me. you will miss me. i can’t even say anything. you seem to know. you have your head down. i know i’m being selfish. but please know, i love you. i love you so much binxy. 




i don’t know what to do. i want help. but i can’t with out going to the hospital. i’m sorry. please forgive me. hold my hand. give me a hug. anything. with one final cry, please. i don’t want to go. but i can’t stay. i’m sorry. i’m sorry.  i’m sorry.",1
post_00004,"relationships i’ve been dumped over dumb stuff. but now, i have a wall up, not because i don’t like love, but because i feel that carrying other’ problems will be too much for me, knowing i think about ending it all every single day. 

i deeply feel like a bad person when i talk to a guy, knowing deep inside, i don’t want to be here and nothing, not even love is enough to make me want to stay. 

i guess not being worth a fight for someone to stay with me did play a part in the walls i have now. also, being ghosted after a first date because i’m chubby. not good enough for anything or anyone. 

i’m only here because i haven’t cleaned out my other storage and have lots of stuff that i don’t want anyone to see. damn, why did i tell them about that storage. 

i’m also only here because my mom would literally have another heart attack if i left. she doesn’t take care of herself and wears the illness like a badge but then still eats like crap which makes me mad and makes me not care how she would feel if i left. 

it’s a complicated mindset everyday.

i’m drinking again. hoping to just drink and never eat so i can lose weight again like i did when i had a horrible episode and dropped 30lbs. 

plus my job always give me the short end of the stick and my coworker is racist. she’s horrible. 

i have nothing or no one to keep going for. just the night sky and day sky and nature.🥺",1

post_00007,"heyyy i really hope ppl i know won’t see this. ever since 4 years ago i have been suffering from acne, doesn’t sound like the end of the world to you prob but now in this world i feel like even a bigger outcast then i already am. it’s not just the acne i have i also have bigger lips, which don’t sound bad but people talk abt it too much even my parents in the morning ask me if i put on lip plumper or if i’m having an allergic reaction. i’m not. well back to the acne, it never got better i already went to the dermatologist and they have to tretnoin or smth and sm other stuff to use, i used it almost for a whole year and nothing changed my face looked as disgusting as it always was and is. every where i go and every person i talk to including my friends and family always ask if i ate smth wrong or if i am using to much stuff on my face, but then recommend stuff to use on my face. in middle school i see everyone have clear skin but they eat a lot of junk food and drink dunkin every day (i’m not hating) whenever i see someone doing that i wonder y their skin isn’t like mine and theirs is clear and beautiful. all my friends have clear skin so i feel different  when i’m with them. i bought loads of makeup to cover it up but it just makes it look worse and for the past 2 weeks my face has been itching and burning to the point where i can’t hold back my tears. i have already had thoughts of suicide before and tried to drown my self and burn but i freak out in the end so instead i just crack my fingers and scratch my skin until it bleeds. today i also had thoughts of dying how there is no point of me living i don’t have any friends who i can talk to and express my feelings i try talking to my mom but i can’t tell anyone about my problems. i went to therapy but i didn’t tell them anything either. the world wouldn’t change if i weren’t here.",1
post_00009,"i can't stop thinking about everything i have ever done wrong. this literally feels like it's against my will. it's not that i am unwilling to stop thinking about things i've done wrong but it feels like any time i can get it to stop my brain goes ""hey remember that time that...?"" it doesn't matter how small it is either, one of the things i keep remembering is a time that i got in trouble when i was 3. i'm 20 and i had forgotten about this even happening until recently. a lot of the other things are about my relationship ranging from things that i really do think are wrong (even if they're forgiven) to my boyfriend getting slightly annoyed at me today (not normally a huge deal), i keep having this thought that he'll break up with me or doesn't want to be with me. i feel it would be better if he didn't have to deal with me. i'm overwhelmed with school even though the new term only started literally yesterday. this is all stressing me out so much and for some reason my reaction to being stressed is to feel suicidal and i don't know what to do to make any of it stop.",1
post_00010,"""it gets better"" is just bullshit that people say to make you feel better when they don't know what to say. it doesn't get better. when it gets better, it gets even worse afterwards. nothing good lasts forever. the bad wouldn't be bad without the good and vice versa. but the bad is just so, so fucking bad. i'm driven one step closer to suicide each time it gets bad, and my expectations on how bad it can get are subverted every time.",1
post_00011,"police officer struggling with suicidal thoughts i cannot openly talk about. this is a throw-away but i intend on reading responses. i think i just mostly want to type and get things off my chest.

(tldr; who can i talk to about my strong desire to kill myself without there being an fear of repercussions?  every outlet i find wants to know my location or my contact info before they'll talk to me.  i just want to call a suicide hotline who won't trace my call.)

i am 35 years old and live and work in southern california as a deputy for the last 10 years; i am no spring chicken.  my wife of 7 years and i have been struggling with infertility for 4 years now. lots of surgery and medication but no end in sight.  the stress of scheduled sex lives has absolutely taken a toll on us.  we're still very much in love, but its not the same.

in july of 2020 i had a fairly ""routine"" call involving child abuse that kind of pushed me over the edge. after the call i had a mental breakdown and i have been out of work since then.

i take 45mg a day of buspar (my wife says it doesn't help me... i am not sure), xanax as needed as prescribed by my do (i originally took....alprazam? but had a rare side effect and had to stop).  he has asked that i see a psychiatrist but the next avail appointment is mid-january. 

i digress...

because of my line of work, if i talk about suicide it can be... well... career suicide (no pun intended).  so i keep all these thoughts absolutely bottled up inside and have to act like i am not having them when my therapists asks about it.  my therapist is provided by work and specializes in law enforcement issues, which is nice at times.

i think about killing myself... hourly? i usually wake up 1-3 a night in the middle of a panic attack.  i cannot get away from this pain; its almost a physical pain. i have specific plans on how i would kill myself; the works.  i think about the entire process in detail often.  when i drink i usually come so close to actually doing it that i really fear its only a matter of time until it happens. which is so ironic to type out.  clearly i have reservations about killing myself when i am in the right state of mind... but when i am in the wrong state of mind it sounds like a realistic idea. i am physically exhausted from all of this i genuinely want the pain to end and i not seeing any answers on how to make it happen.

i want to talk to someone about this without putting my job on the line (being put on a 5150 hold in ca means i cannot carry a gun and therefore... yeah...).  i am so heartbroken and frustrated i just don't know what to do anymore.  every day seems like groundhog day.  i desperately want my wife to leave me because she deserves better; it would make it a lot easier to end my life if she hated me.  i have completely gotten rid of social media and blocked my parents out of my life for no really good reason.  what a downward spiral the last few months has been.

who can i talk to about my strong desire to kill myself without there being an fear of repercussions?  every outlet i find wants to know my location or my contact info before they'll talk to me.  i just want to call a suicide hotline who won't trace my call.  i really think i will end up killing myself within the next few months, but ironically i don't want to talk to anyone who might be able to stop me. this is so backwards.

post_00017,"is having intrusive thoughts normal? hi, not sure if right community to ask, as people here seem to have more complex problems than mine, but i want to give it a try.

is it normal to have suicidal thoughts? are you having them? i do not plan to kill myself, it's more like while driving a car i think ""i should smash myself into that tree"". the second after that i think ""no, that would make my daughter sad"". sometimes while walking through the bridge i think about jumping over the railing and falling on the highway.

its not always a simple thought about killing myself. sometimes i think about stuff that will make my life so miserable that the only solution to not be baggage to anyone is to kill myself - like today i thought it would be interesting to hit my eyeball with scissors. after that i thought it would be stupid to explain so i thought i would need to poke both my eyes. but that would make me useless and unable to work, so i could not provide for my family. those are scary.

i don't know if those things are normal or if i should talk about them with someone. it intensifies when i'm stressed and overworked, but i'm worried that someday those thoughts will win.",1

post_00021,"the plan you take a nice shower. you put on your comfiest sweater and fuzzy socks. it’s the middle of the night, nice and dark and quiet. ideally it’s raining. you prepare your favourite meal. eat until you feel just right. pet the kitties goodbye... they were always there for you. dont cry. they will be loved by your relatives or other kind people of this world. 

you wrote out a note explaining everything. hand written, over and over. hell, it’ll never say it all but it gets the point across. they will get a glimpse into what you were thinking. no more frantic late night texts. no more of them pretending to care. no more troubling the ones you love the most. they’ll be sad at first but in time they’ll remember all the good things about you and thats what they’ll say... she was so sweet. her heart was too big for this world. she had so much potential. we all loved her so much. 

so you’ll tuck into bed, knowing all that. you’ll finally feel at peace. thankful. it’s over. no more pain. get extra comfy, cover up. put the gun to your head and pull the trigger.

post_00028,"i need to vent about my life  i honestly don’t know how to keep going, i had these thoughts before as well, but now they’re back and i really feel like i’m ready now. 
i haven’t had the best life, started off as a mistake, mom and dad weren’t even never together. got a shitty narcissistic stepdad who basically took everything from me, my mom, my dad and even tried taking my life. luckily i left my toxic excuse of a family a few years back and moved with my grandparents. otherwise i would really have committed then and there. but what really hurts the most is how my mom decided to stay with that man, how she quietly watched how he treated me and saw me leave everything behind just so i could save myself, and still chose him over me. 
i’m not in contact with my dad too much either, but more than my mom. i really feel like an orphan, but it’s even worse when you have parents, but they’re just not there because they abandoned you. 
i haven’t got much friends either, or ones that really care. the only person by my side is my grandma and i’m so terrified of the day she passes, what will my life become then, then i can truly say that i have no one. i should be studying but i got no motivation, i just can’t do anything, i don’t care about anything, i have no dreams. the only thing that somehow has kept me going is my dog, but now even that doesn’t make me want to go on. i didn’t write my whole life down and left out the gruesome stuff and all. in my 18 years of life i can’t really remember anything good happening, a whole life should be ahead of me but regarding the life i have had so far i got no hopes for a better one.  i really thought that once i got away from my stepdad i’d be happy, seems like that isn’t the case, just when i thought i got better, depression decides to make a comeback.

post_00035,"i am commiting suicide in 10 days, i feel like i'm the worst person in the world. i have been keeping a big secret for 4 years now. my family thinks i have been going to university for the past 4 years but little did they know, including my friends and relatives, that i dropped out in the middle of the first semester of my freshman year. i managed to keep it a secret from all of them by forging false documents and giving them assurance every time they ask me a question about how my academics was going. it also helps that the university is 2 hours away from my home so i actually rent near it. i go home every weekend thinking ""do they know already?"". i know a lot about my field as i practice it every now and then by working with a licensed engineer. i don't make a lot of money from it though but the things i learned that is connected to the degree program is what kept me from blanking when asked by my family about my academic life.

i have run out of time. the graduation from the university is 10 days away and everyone thinks i am graduating. and i am somewhat happy, that i can finally end my life. i have been such a big disappointment for my parents. i am their only child. i cry everytime i imagine what my mom would feel after i do it. my girlfriend, who by the way also doesn't know anything broke up with me yesterday, which makes the goodbye part of it all very hard. i have planned everything out already, from what i'll use to when and where. i just wanted to vent some of the heaviness from my chest. i feel so sad about my parents and my (ex) girlfriend. i am gonna start writing my suicide letters tomorrow. thank you guys.",1

post_00043,"i survived and i can be happy a month ago i cut my wrist and tried to end my life. it didn’t work. these past few weeks i’ve been feeling better and sometimes i even feel hopeful

a while ago i met someone i had been working with. i had thought we became friends. i really valued this friendship. i felt they were leading me on and gave them a few weeks to stop. they didn’t so i decided to talk to them privately not thinking it was that big of a deal. they lied to me about it. it wasn’t a big deal but lying made it so much worse. honesty is a big thing for me. so i stopped talking to them for a couple days but got over it. we had another talk about the subject and after they hated me and i don’t know why

i was sad at first because i thought we were friends and it hurt me. eventually i decided i no longer wanted to speak to this person because they were treating me horribly. they started being hostile towards me, spreading lies about me and doing everything they can to hurt me. this really did hurt me. i thought this person was my friend and they started acting this way towards me out of no where and i didn’t understand and it made me think there was something wrong with me

this situation brought my mental health to a very bad point. this person was aware i struggled with mental health and continued acting this way towards me. i honestly believe they really wanted to hurt me as much as they could. i started hurting myself again for the first time in years, the whole situation made me really sad.

i tried ignoring it, i tried doing things like an employee of the month in order to repair the issue but nothing worked and this person wouldn’t stop. they started getting their friends to act hostile towards me as well and i continued trying to be helpful and nice even though i was hurting so much inside. eventually i had to make a complaint hoping this would finally make them stop

they stopped for a month but eventually continued. i hated making that complaint but didn’t know what else to do. i’ve never worked somewhere like this before with people like that before. eventually i had to quit my job knowing i didn’t have the money to support myself. after i was hurt and bothered by the situation but every day it was going away, it would just take time.
 
i tried to stand up for myself. they spread lies about me saying i’m dangerous. i would never hurt someone. any of my friends, coworkers would never think of me that way. she said this knowing it wasn’t true. i’ve ran into multiple people working there since then and none of them were scared of me. these lies destroyed me. kindness is the most important thing to me, i care so much about helping others and being kind and this person lied and said i was dangerous and it broke me.

i begged them not to do it, i told them it would destroy me and my life but they did it anyways. afterwards i fell into a spiral and started hurting myself more and more. the pain was so much. everything i had worked for had been taken away, it hurt so much. i thought about killing myself everyday but it was terrifying. eventually i cut my wrist but it didn’t work. i’ve done it multiple times since then. i’ve cried to please be able to wake up from this nightmare, all i’ve wanted is to be happy again. i made videos hurting myself, im embarrassed but i understand that the depression overwhelmed me and the pain was too much. most people don’t understand how much depression can hurt

ive been doing better these past few weeks. i’ve been lucky to now be surrounded by good people. spirit, scooters and now justlove. these people here are good people and they really really like me. everyone there really likes me and thinks im a good person and tells me thing like “bryson it is such a pleasure working with you”, “normally i get anxiety around people but for someone reason i feel comfortable around you”, “sorry if i seem mean, i feel really comfortable around you and act mean to people i like”, they really like me and all these things they say make me so happy

i worked there at that place for so long surrounded by those horrible people that they convinced me that there was something wrong with me and i believed it. now that i’ve been surrounded by good people and all these places and now that i can stop and remind myself that ive been surrounded by good people in the past too, now i know that i was unlucky. i was unlucky to work at a place like that. i could have worked any where else and i’d still be happy now, i know that

most people are good. most people like me and think i’m good. i know im a good person. those people were horrible. they were the mean, inconsiderate, self centered, and most horrible people i have ever met. all of them. i’ve worked places where you have a bad apple but somehow all the most horrible people in this town gathered in that one place and they were so horrible to be around. they only cared about themselves and they couldn’t see how horrible they were so they treated me like i was crazy and made me believe it but i stood out there because im good surrounded by evil. i don’t stand out at scooters or just love because the people there are good

i don’t understand how people can be so evil, so mean. i wish i would’ve worked anywhere else. i wish i never met those people. i’m happy that im no longer surrounded by them and i have good people around me who help me, care about me, are kind to me and who are good. that girl, i tried to be her friend and i was hurt that she acted that way, her continuing to act that way really really hurt me and her acting that way for months was too much, and then even after she continued and it destroyed me and i spiraled and hurt myself again and again and the pain the pain was so much i couldn’t handle it

but i survived. and sometimes i feel hopeful. and i’m starting to think i can be happy again. the people around me really like me and that makes me so happy and they’re kind. i’ve realized how big of an impact the people i surround myself with can have on me. those people gas lighted me and convinced me there was something wrong with me but i know now that’s not true. i know now they were bad people. they were mean and cruel and the most horrible people i have ever met in my entire life and they grouped up and it was too much. but now i’m free from that

i survived and i think i can be happy again. i think i can be happy like before. i hope i never see any of those people again. i hope one day they understand just how much they hurt me and i hope they never treat anyone else this way again. i wish this never happened to me. this pain, this experience, it broke me. i barely survived. i’ve lost so much these past 6 months because of their lies and hate. i’ll never understand that hate. i could’ve never hated them the same way. i don’t understand it. but i don’t have to. but i wish i worked anywhere else because i moved here to do something with my life, to be happy, and i was happy so happy coming to columbia but i was unfortunate to be surrounded by those people, they ruined this new experience for me and almost broke me with their hate but i survived and i think i can be happy again

i barely survived, their hate hurt me, really hurt me. but i think i can be happy again. i feel free from all of this, from them, and i think i can be happy again. i hope i don’t ever feel this way again and i don’t ever hurt myself again",1

post_00050,"i dont know what to do there are 12 days left until my 18th birthday. i’ve had depression since i was 12, and i’ve been on controlled medication (venlafaxine and lamotrigine) for about 3 years now.
last year, i accidentally got into the college i wanted, but my family decided to take legal action because i hadn’t finished high school yet. i ended up attending college and finishing my last year of high school at the same time until october, when the legal process concluded, and they decided to revoke my spot, even though i was already halfway through the second semester.

that caught me by surprise since i hadn’t signed up to reapply for college (since i was already there). i had to sign up quickly, and luckily i made it to the second round.

i spent the last month thinking about how to gather the courage and find methods to kill myself in case i didn’t get the spot, but i couldn’t come to any conclusion.

today, the admission exam results came out, and i failed. my friend could do it, and her graduation party is on friday, but i don’t want to face her or anyone else. honestly, i feel like i’m just a burden to my parents, with the cost of medications, therapy, and private school, which i didn’t even have the decency to honor by passing college admission again.

i’ve lived a short life, but i don’t have any major regrets. now all i want is to die in peace, but it seems like dying is so difficult.

i already cut myself today and haven’t been able to stop thinking about killing myself in the bathroom by cutting my wrists, but i don’t want my parents to see my body. they would probably want to move out of the house, and i don’t want to cause too much trouble.

honestly, i found this reddit after searching on google for some forum that teaches a safe and painless method to die, and i ended up writing this. i know some people might think my story is stupid since i haven’t committed any heinous crime to justify dying, but honestly, i don’t think my life has much value to need a big reason to end it.

i still don’t know how i’m going to do it, but i know i don’t want to see anyone. i just want to disappear.",1

until i made it home. and then i sat in my driveway and sobbed.

when i went inside, i broke down in front of my roommates and had a severe panic attack and my roommate just rubbed my back and helped me breath.

the next day, my best friend took me out to eat. i told her i almost did it. and she said “i could tell a few days before that you were off. and i didn’t say anything. i’m sorry, i should have. i didn’t want you to feel like i was smothering you.”

post_00066,"it does not make sense for me to want to die… i have no history of trauma. the only slightly bad thing that has ever happened to me is that my mother abandoned me when i was a baby, but i had my wonderful grandmother who stepped into that role, and i could not have asked for anyone better to raise me. i have friends who love and care about me. i have a job with steady and reasonable pay, and even my coworkers like me and talk to me every day. i am a student at a great college, which i am on mental health leave from, but i am free to return whenever i want. 


there is so much good in my life, so much going for me, that it feels like a slap in the face to people with actual problems that i want to throw that all away. so what that my grandma and my dad hate that i’m trans? there are people who get kicked out onto the streets for that. i should just get over myself and not care whether they use a damn pronoun or not. why should it matter that my dad is mean to me? people have fathers that beat and rape them, and my relationship with mine was good up until a few years ago. 

logically i know that suicidal thoughts are a symptom of depression, so that should make it easier for me to overcome them. it’s not really what i want, just my brain telling me it’s what i want. so why am i still planning to kill myself on sunday? why would i let a disorder take my life when it has so much promise? but i can’t make myself care about any of it anymore. i don’t care about my future. it’s selfish, but i barely even care about leaving everyone behind anymore. i’m not special and i’m not that good of a person, so they should be able to move on just fine. i know it will hurt, but i don’t contribute much to anything. i’m lazy and a little stupid. 


my best friend wished me a happy birthday today and said they love me and they’re glad i’m here. my reaction was to feel sad that there are people who love me so much that they’d be utterly devastated if i died, and it frustrated me that i can’t kill myself guilt free. what kind of person thinks like that? someone so selfish they don’t even deserve to be alive. my friends and family deserve someone better who wouldn’t even dream of leaving them behind like that. so does my cat. i tried writing out a note and individual texts for everyone, and there were so many to do that it got overwhelming, so what does that say? 

the one thing making me hesitate is that it will hurt or that it won’t work and i’ll just end up in a psych ward again. usually i skip the step of attempting and just check myself in for a while because oding isn’t that great of a method in terms of reliability and pain. those times i knew i didn’t really want to die. i just wanted help and for things to get better. but i’m very tempted to try on the off chance that i can get it right. i couldn’t conceptualize death back then like i can now. i’m pretty sure it wouldn’t feel like anything, and that’s what i long for. i don’t want to exist. i want to feel nothing. 

there must be some hope for me because i decided to stay alive long enough to turn 22 and to watch timothée chalamet on snl, so maybe i can try sticking it out even beyond that. i counted my grandma’s blood pressure pills, and i read that a man died taking about half of the amount i have access to, so i’m pretty sure if i actually had the guts to do it, it could work. it would be very unpleasant, i’m sure, but it probably would get the job done. 

if anyone actually read all of this, thanks for listening, and i hope you stick around to find out if life has better things to offer. very hypocritical of me to say, but i mean it.",1

i'm a 17-year-old dude, i live somewhere in north africa, i've been dealing with mental illness for more than 3 years now. i'm kinda traumatized because of all the bullying i've been dealing with since i was young, i don't really get bullied now but i can get verbally hurt as i can't really deal with the other party due to the lack of my social skills. anyways, i didn't have any chance to make a good long-term friendship in my short life. mostly, they get bored of me or i just push them away. i decided to go to a therapist because those problems were affecting me in a very bad way and distracting me from studying. but it didn't help much since the therapist wasn't that good. i decided to cut myself and do other forms of self-harm, whether it's starving myself or purging whatever i ate, etc.. a year later, my parents noticed my unhealthy behavior and decided to take me to a psychiatrist, i was diagnosed then with schizophrenia and severe depression, i began to take medications and they helped me a lot but the side effects were taking away a lot from me, my memory was and still pretty corrupted and i wasn't able to do everyday activity, in addition to blurry vision, vertigo, etc., i was in the last year of high school and exams came so i stopped going to the psychiatrist. i got a really bad grade despite doing my best, i stopped taking my medications cold turkey. i went to a below-average college and my mental state is really declining. i was able to get a pistol but my parents found out about it. my plan was ruined and i'm under some kind of suicide watch. i really can't take it anymore, just everyone telling me to ""man up!"" and ""a lot of people are going through worse"", i'm also kinda guilt-tripped.

post_00087,"i've worked too hard and too long to have nothing. the first problem is finances. i'm 37 years old and i've been working towards a stable career since i was 18, and every time i specialize in something new, there is a recession or the market plummets for that career.

i have a master's degree and 2 other degrees, experience in multiple professions, speak english and spanish, three years experience as a software developer, got laid off twice, and i can't find a job. i've worked for many years, and this was supposed to be my time to finally at least live comfortably and be able to do things like buy a home and start a family. i've been to college for 11.5 years and have a ton of student loans, and can't get a job no matter what i do. i got laid off my decent paying job back in june because no clients wanted anyone without at least about 8 years of employed experience, and i got hired by another company in november and got laid off again 2 weeks ago because the company decided to combine tasks to one team and shrink the staff because it was slow. i've applied for over 250 jobs recently and not a single interview because they all only want the most experienced people that require no training or assistance.

in addition, i have autism, and the only people i've connected with mostly in the last decade are people who use that to their advantage to get things out of me and then blow me off afterwards. i was helping mentor and be like a parental figure to a friend's children who i really cared about, and after they got what they wanted out of me after claiming i was like a father to them for 5 years, they all the sudden weren't interested in seeing me anymore except for maybe when i was needed to help get them a job or a ride.

i used to have a best friend and i haven't seen her in 9.5 years. she wasn't a friend, she was a best friend. someone i told things to that i never told anyone else. after awhile, she started going through problems and taking them out on me, always losing jobs every week and saying it was someone else's fault, taking anxiety pills and antidepressants while loading up on alcohol, tried college but quit in the middle of the first semester because it was too hard, and eventually just chose not to talk to me at all anymore when i didn't validate her blaming everyone else for what she was going through.

i also volunteered as a host parent for high school exchange students, and i had one really good kid from thailand, but the rest were spoiled, entitled, blamed me for their problems, and eventually made up lies about me just so they can get a family with more luxuries like they pictured such as pools at their house, lots of space, etc.

so, what's really bothering me though, is everything i do succeed or catch a break at ends up being too good to be true. friendships, jobs, other events in life always getting screwed up. every time it appears i'm going to get to the next milestone in life, there is a market collapse, betrayed by someone sociopathic that i thought was my friend, etc.

i honestly just wanna die and i'm planning it. i'm thinking around 3-4 months is my timeframe that i'll go to a hotel, bring a helium tank and make an exit bag, and then let some hotel employee find me after checkout time the next day.

post_00093,"bleh tried hanging today. i needed to swallow. i hate the feeling of needing to swallow but not being able to. nothing hurt during, it felt a bit like white noise which i think is bliss, it was just that uncomfortable feeling of needing to swallow. which i don't want to call an attempt if i quit trying over something so fucking stupid. coming to fairbanks killed me, or i'm making it. but i don't fucking fit in here. norms are different. feels like i'm going to lose my anemic fingers multiple times a winter. things that are minor inconveniences anywhere else are health threatening here because of severe cold and lack of medical providers. relationships are weird here. i don't get it. but it's not just the place. learning i'm a piece of shit right once i step out of the bubble of people who have put up with me my whole life. nothings fun anymore. nothings getting easier. the dreams i had for my life are no longer reachable. my plans for my partner and i are shot and weren't even doable to begin with. the life i wanted to give my kid isn't attainable. how i wanted to raise my kid isnt possible. my sisters dissapointed in me. my dad's so proud of me not knowing that i'm miserable and my sister being disappointed is almost too much, but my dad being proud of me has meant so much. i don't know. i've had close calls with suicide starting young. holding chambered guns to my head, finger on the trigger,even squeezing as light as i knew i could, trying to picture it ending. recently i had a suicide attempt last year that i did go through with and failed. getting to the point of thinking i'm just sick. i'm too scared to die. so i don't know why i keep trying. but it's just a burst of emotion inside of a longterm feeling of low and i act on it. i hate when people say suicide is cowardess or easy way out. what i'm doing is cowardess. ignoring all the screaming in your head and following through is tough, impossible for me. doing something hard to get to a place of personal comfort is commendable. that's college. that's entrepreneurship. that's training for a sport. i just hate that i feel this way without a good enough reason to want to die, i have a fucking daughter that is the coolest thing i've ever seen in my life. she's one. i love her more than ive loved anything. i just know and i'm proving i can't be the man she needs and i want to be so bad so bad so bad so bd sp badi want to be the best dad in the world i stg i do. she's amazing. i can't believe honestly i'm the person who thinks my daughter not knowing me would be better. i don't know how i got here. i don't know when i got here. i never thought i'd be here.",1

i want you to understand something: no matter what you have—your house, your cars, your vacations—it won’t be enough. it will never fill the emptiness that you seem to carry, and i hope, for your sake, that you realize that one day. i hope it will be worthwhile.

you’ve let your ego blind you. you cannot see beyond it. your narcissistic tendencies might have gotten you far, but they’ll never bring you long-term happiness. not for you, and definitely not for anyone who’s been close to you.

the young girl you once took advantage of has grown into a woman who will never allow herself to be treated that way again. you will never make me question my worth again.

i want no connection with you. you represent everything i’ve learned to avoid in a man, and i can’t believe i was ever naïve enough to stay in this. please, leave me the fuck alone. i never want to speak to you again. if one day we cross paths- we didn’t .  you are a stranger & this is over for me. the pain from this relationship has been insurmountable, and i hope it doesn’t harden my heart. i look forward to a future void of you.

post_00107,"to no one and to all i know i may be too scared to die, but.. everything's just crumbling. i feel so lifeless. it feels like my body has energy, yet i have little to no motivation.

my parents are narcissists, that can't change even in the slightest for their daughter. i'm taking years to get better myself and i've finally reached a place of confidence and analysis that prevents breakdowns.

the only person i can call a friend is not replying to messages that will either make or break the friendship, which is okay, but it also breaks me. waiting is hard. yet he's been so not trustworthy recently.. it feels like he doesn't care. he doesn't really check in on me, even though i'm going through a really rough time. he doesn't plan things with me and initiate those things. he sometimes ignores my messages after asking how i am.. and we talked about how hurtful these things are.. yet, well, we are here. i just need to wait. maybe he's planning to find a replacement or strength to tell me to fuck off.

me and my partner are constantly having issues, we are so so close to breaking up. at times it feels wonderful, during others it feels like breaking up is inevitable. i often fall into idealization and devaluing because he doesn't meet my needs. it hurts. all of it. he is also not very emotionally ""advanced"". he has only started his healing journey. he's suicidal and depressive. i've been in this healing journey for 7-9 years now. we don't match on that. he has so much to learn.. but it's been a year and i feel hopeless on this subject. again, waiting.

waiting is so tiring. it's so stressful.

then there's uni. my uni acts like it's very individualized and cares about mental health. well, that's wrong. they don't care, they're a big institution that care about being advertised as caring, but not really being. and i have 1,5 years of that left. it feels like school all over again. i am so tired of memorizing.. it's so useless. exams and midterms basically only test memory. i am just so tired.. again - waiting. waiting for uni to end.

and then we have the future. the amount of uncertainty, the amount of possible loneliness, the amount of stress and work and bullshit that might or might not happen, or the fact i will need to work my whole life.. all of it is torturous.

not a single thing in my life feels stable. i don't want to be alive, but since i developed an insane fear of death, i am left with hopelessness, living by distractions. there's nothing to rationalize anymore, nothing to analyze. i just want one singular person to be stable and safe. just one. i'm tired of being by myself, i'm tiring of being able to cry mostly only when i'm alone. i'm just tired. i'm tired. waiting.",1

last night when i was walking home from work, i accidentally found myself walking behind a young woman who was going to her car. since i am tall and quite muscular, i wanted to get ahead of her so as to not freak her out. i started to run a little, but she screamed and fled to her car which was only a couple meters away. needless to say, i feel completely horrible about it and i've felt like shit ever since.

i went home from work earlier today after only working for about ten minutes as the pain was so intense and i couldn't focus on my job. i then attempted suicide which didn't really seem to do anything. ever since, i've desperately wanted some guidance from someone but no one is around to help me out. this probably isn't a big deal, but like i said this has been eating away at me for way too long.

post_00116,"last night i dreamt that i was happy. i'd forgotten what it felt like. it's a curious thing, really. waking up and realizing just what your life has become. opening your eyes and looking around a room full of the stuff that used to excite you. after years and years of being just barely aware of the passage of time, coming to the stark realization that you have nothing left.

i suppose i should be thankful. i have lived a life overflowing with privilege, and have been just handed over opportunities that most people would have to fight for, and that many never get to have anyway. my parents love me deeply, that i know for a fact. never in my life have i ever had to wonder where my next meal was gonna come from, or whether i would still have a home when the bills came. i've always had it all, and from this treasured oasis of opportunity i have built nothing but this small room filled with broken toys and half forgotten dreams.

i used to feel angry about the life i've wasted. when the anger ran out and i realized there was no one to blame but myself, i felt sad. now the decades have slipped by without ever realizing it, what was supposed to be the best time of my life is now behind me, and now i feel nothing. nothing but a hollow certainty that, just as i longed in my childhood to reach for the stars, now i just long for a quiet funeral, where the very few that cared will mourn and the many that knew my name will soon forget.

post_00126,"i'm a waste tonight i was going to do it. in my parents' home. i was going to lay on my bed and bleed out from my wrists and die. 

my mom walked in when i was just lightly scraping my skin to mark where i'd cut later tonight. she said ""i just wanted to see you."" i had to hide my body under the covers so that i could keep her from seeing what i had done to my arm and my body at that point. she came in and laid down on my bed and rest her head on my lap. ""it's comfortable,"" she said. i tried my best to hold back tears. 

she eventually left and now i'm here, staring at my razorblade, wondering why i'm left here as a sympathetic, pitiful loser. all i can imagine is my mom opening the door to my childhood bedroom and seeing my blood-stained mattress with a lifeless sack of organs on top. i can imagine her crying. 

i feel like a waste of money and time. the thousands of dollars that have been pumped into me for the promise of a successful future is too much. the time that people have invested in me for relationships and friendships is too much time that would've been better spent anywhere else. the only time i enjoy is time wasted on videogames and music. i am less than mediocre at both. 

my whole life has been infested with lies and attention whoring. i've lied about my age online so that guys wouldn't be afraid to talk to me. i've created a whole new person that interacts with me and my friend group online just so i can make my other friends jealous. i lie to my friends to manipulate them into doing what i want them to do. as for the attention whoring, i've done enough of it in my early teens. at 14, i was telling men online that i was 18. id send them pictures of myself so that i could get validation. i craved the romantic attention that i never got at that age.

it's now 12am and i'm still here, scoring my thighs and spitting on the wounds. i've taken breaks while typing this and i feel like i'm ready. i just need some validation that i'm not the only one that knows that their life is completely fucked from decisions made by themselves. 

so. speaking of decisions that i made that fucked up my life.
i'm living with 43° scoliosis that gives me severe backpain that (shocker) i have given to myself. i, as the attention whore i was in elementary school, longed for something that would make me different from the other kids at school. i sat in weird postures and slept in strange positions until my spine decided to follow through with my plan. the next scoliosis check that i had, i was told to get checked for scoliosis. lo and behold, now i'm at a 43° curve that requires a long and painful surgery to fix. 
i also fucked with my eyesight as a child so that i could get glasses. now i'm stuck with 7mm thick lenses in my glasses that signify that i'm legally blind to anyone that even sees my glasses. 
i again fucked up my life when i decided to go along with my parents' narrative and pretend to be christian. now i've been working at my church for 6 years. i've also been attending and tithing every week. i'm in the worship band and am currently planning a summer retreat. after 14 years of church, i still don't know what the fuck is going on.

i'm tired of being the second child that is happy and creative and spontaneous and yay!!!!

i'm tired of asking for help and never getting any

i'm tired of lying to people

i'm tired of being a waste of time and money

i'm tired of being completely mediocre

it is now 1am and i'm going to do it in 3 hours. 

time to write an unorganized essay for a suicide note.

would it be funny if i wrote it like how highschoolers write their essays? idk

thanks for reading my rambling and my unorganized baby-babble

edit: haha im still here. im still here. im still here.

i spent all night last night trying to write a suicide note, trying to justify myself, trying to excuse myself from living. i wrote a crude one and posted it here before i started the one i meant for my parents and friends. i got three pages in and i fell asleep from exhausting myself mentally and physically. a dark, dreamless sleep that has left me contemplating this morning. i look down at my thighs and my wrists and wonder if dying is really what i want. i read the beginning of my note and pity the author. my sheets are bloody from my thighs and i know my mom can already only handle the smallest bit of blood before going queasy. 

am i going insane? i cant follow through on anything, and now i cant follow through on my own suicide attempt. i had it all planned out and scheduled so that i could finally have something that i scheduled correctly. now im 5 hours late to my own death.

i read the comments in this post and i've spent the past 5 minutes trying to figure out a way to tell you i'm still here. i cant tell if what you all have said is something i should be grateful for or if i should despise you. i guess my answer will come in time. 

in the meantime, im still here and i still feel like shit. i felt like this kind of update is needed to this type of situation.",1

i ended up being stagnant and pretending i was fine after the weeks, stayed for christmas and new years so my family won’t hate me as much, they’re not really good with mental health but they’ve came a long way. anyway, i felt myself literally tumble into a depressive episode sunday evening, it’s bad. when i say i can’t eat i can’t, i am more stuck than ever which means my time has definitely come to an end. 

i always have suicidal thoughts, intentions and bad impulse control. even if i wait to get out of this, i’ll just be a “lighter” suicidal person, i’ll still commit and be a burden around others. honestly, i am hysterically laughing right now because i am not holding anymore of this. i carry my sexual abuse like a book, there’s a list of people who’ve touched me and i can’t remember half. then i remember the one family member who did, who is so close to me. why. 

sorry for venting so much. i thought i would be able to write more about it since i can’t talk about it, but clearly i’m taking it to the grave like i promised eight year old me. i have a crisis appointment tomorrow in the afternoon, i plan to kill myself at night or in the morning by finally having the guts to jump off the bridge right next to me. it’s embarrassing but it calls me. 

i rather suffer a few minutes than any longer on this earth, i won’t go in depth of the plan but it will work and this is probably it. in the case of me not doing it, i’ll go the crisis appointment but i expect anything, nobody has taken me seriously since the day i was fucking born. 
i won’t say anything to make them think i’m a harm to myself, i’ve said i am multiple times and met with dissatisfied faces sending me home.

post_00136,"i would rather kill myself than grow as a person i'm fucking done with life man. life fucking sucks in every which way. i do not want to be honest about who i am. i do not want yo grow. i do not want to accept anything. i do not want responsible. i don't want to work hard or be a part of anyone's life. i don't want to make a difference or contribute to society. having a career of any kind is too much fucking work. the truth is i'm perfectly happy to be a leech until nobody is willing to help me out. the. i'll logically be on the streets and at that point i will kill myself. but why let it go that far? why shouldn't i buy a gun asap and be done with it before life even has the opportunity to force me to try being responsible and engaging in the world around me, when i want nothing to do with that? i'm a loser and i'm okay with that. not being a loser is seriously too much work. giving enough shit to learn useful things is too much work. i just want to kill myself before anyone that knows me figures out that i don't give a shit about my life or other people and i'm not interested in the least in being responsible in any sense of the word.",1

post_00147,"i can't live anymore i celebrated my birthday 4 days ago and now i am 20. life's is a shit. i broke up with my girlfriend last year, december 23 and after that i realised my mistakes and begged her to come back to me. i've been miserable my whole life and she's the only person who understands me. 

i decided to send her a message that i want a closure but the truth is i want to see her and fix it out, but then last night, i decided to contact her sister. she's also my friend and she's good when it comes to giving out advices, but i did a wrong thing.

me and my girlfriend were both female and our family in bith sides doesn't know this and her family is strict because of her religion and now i just spilled it out to her sister about us. i told her not to tell it to her, but when she went home, she decided to ask her what's her sexuality.

i know it's my fault, i made her out without her knowing and it's not my intention at all, all i want is an advice because i don't know where to go.

i got angry at her sister and she got angry at me too. my girlfriend got angry at me. i know she already agreed to meet me next month, but now she doesn't want to see me anymore. she said she almost gave me a chance but now she doesn't want to and told me to let go and move on.

now, i lost everything. i don't even like my program, i don't have friends, i lost my girlfriend, i do have a bad relationship with my family, i don't want to live anymore. 

now, i am planning to go to the beach tomorrow and drown myself. 

i already told my friends about my problem and they didn't almost care. now, that's a go signal. i'm so fed up with myself. i felt like i am being punished. i think that all of the karmas are with me. i hope they'll respect my decision. 

beach is like my home, i know how to swim, but i don't know how to swim at the beach. i am already doing a letters for them, by saying goodbye. please respect my decision",1
post_00148,has anyone had a good day but still wanted to kill themselves? i had a good day today and i felt really nice after venting and crying it out to an old family friend last night. it felt so exhilarating that i actually postponed my thought: “maybe i *will* live through this. maybe i *can* change my mind” but something in me still felt like i only had a few weeks left. and i still felt like *i have to do this* i can’t stay. i still am looking forward to my death and am planning to continue on with my plans but i don’t know why i felt good today but not good enough to keep living. has anyone else had the same thing happen?,0
post_00149,"why the fuck do parents continue to treat their children like trash even when they know they're suicidal? one minute they're like 'oh my god honey i'm so scared for you i'll do anything"" and the next they don't give a shit I can't understand why my parents can't see the pain I'm going through.

post_00151,"idk in a few hours my mother will be startled awake by a sudden noise. she will rush upstairs to my room where she will find my body, sitting limp against my bedrest, my brains coating the wall behind me. she will scream, she will cry, she will want her own life to end. this is the only way i can be free. if she loves me she will know. if not, then i suppose its better this way. in some ways this is her fault. but i am mostly to blame. nonetheless, i hope she kills herself in grief so she can be spared from it, i wonder what my coworkers will say about me, or my friends, if they even care for more than a day. so yeah fuck it im just gonna do it now.",0
post_00152,"too cowardly to kill myself but too depressed to keep living this is not going to be an easy post for anyone to read or for me to write. to establish things immediately, no i am not considering s\*\*cide or am i in immediate danger. i would never do that to my mom, the one person in this world who truly knows me and cares about me.

with that said, i think i'm just done with life. it's been building for awhile and it just keeps building. it doesn't have much to do with the coronavirus or the riots but those have been the final straws. the coronavirus has taken away my ability to even attempt to make new friends, try new activities or even do things i enjoyed like traveling and playing tennis. luckily workouts have resumed in my state so i can do that. the riots have taken away my love for sports and history. it seems like everything i love slowly but surely is being taken away from me by various forces.

even the activities i enjoy i don't enjoy as much as i used to. i feel like all they do is temporarily dull the mental and physical pain that i now feel constantly.

the coronavirus has shown me just how hollow and empty my life has become. god is definitely not in my life and i am angry at him for various things (that i'll get into here in a minute). i am single and i have no kids or even pets to keep my company. while others at least had family to keep them company i've had no one. this coronavirus pandemic has officially isolated me. most of my family live in another state and i would be hesitant to travel for fear of getting them sick. plus my nieces wouldn't see me anyway, they've bought into all the fear.

i have failed so often at dating it's become comical. i decided to get back into dating with stuff opening up. i went on a date on tuesday that i thought was going well. we played mini golf but then, according to her, her perfume started messing with her allergies. we didn't have any food or drinks after the round as she felt like she needed to go home. i contact her thursday where she tells me that she's been seeing another guy for awhile and that they have decided to be official and she wants to see where it goes. needless to say i sent a nice little message to her, nothing rude but telling her i thought it was pretty low to have gone on a date with me knowing i had no chance. like so many other times in my dating life i just felt used.

besides being single with no kids or no pets i don't have a lot of friends. the few i do have know i struggle with depression at times and really do try to help. they all think i'm a very good guy who's just had bad luck and they truly believe i'm a good guy who deserves love and happiness. i just don't know if it's in my cards at this point.

besides that my body failed on me pretty early. i'm 35 but my body started failing on me around 30. always had high blood pressure that was hereditary. now i'm slightly overweight, have hemorrhoids occasionally and also suffer from allergies and eosinophilic asthma. i was on a flight to nashville back in 2017 (2 hour flight) where my throat really dried out. i started to panic which then caused my asthma to flare up. no medical emergency but it was a horrible flight. now my doctor has me take a xanax 0.25mg tablet before the flight to relax and a prednisone 50mg tablet to control the asthma. it's worked but whereas i used to love flying i now dread it. i feel like it's destroyed my ability to travel, i don't want to fly for longer than a few hours. but there's so many places i've wanted to see. i've asked my doctor about it and i've asked a pulmonologist about it but they don't seem to take it seriously. i think they think it's all mental for me at this point. ever since i became afraid to fly it's destroyed me a piece at a time.

so besides my body betraying me my mind has betrayed me as well. i know i've suffered from some anxiety like i mentioned but even my therapist won't officially diagnose me with depression. my mind is always half empty and i think my physical conditions have caused my mind to deteriorate.

all in all part of me truly wants to believe in reincarnation. that we get multiple chances at this life and that i'll just get another chance. i know christian religions don't believe in reincarnation but it's one of the few things that gives me hope. i will say this, i think god made a mistake having me be born during this time. i believe i was born in the wrong time.

i have a job that's a good job but it's ultimately a dead end job. i've never been one who had that light click on in terms of a passion. i've always been adrift in terms of what i want to do. yes i have a bachelor's degree with a double major in management and marketing. i also have my shrm certification as a certified hr professional. but if i'm honest i don't have a passion for any of it.

so my personal life is a mess. my physical health s\*cks, my mental health s\*cks. i don't have many friends and my dating life is an absolute failure. i feel like a lot of my passions are being taken away from me one by one. the coronavirus is going to make it impossible to make new friends. the riots have shown me that a lot of country hates me for my very existence. they hate me just for being a white conservative male.

i am a walking contradiction. i don't want to die and don't have to guts to but i've lost most of my will to live. i've wasted my youth, my best days are behind me and not in front of me and i no longer have any zest for life. deep down pretty much nothing makes my happy anymore. sure some activities dull the pain temporarily but i've lost the ability to feel happy. i've lost the ability to connect with people. i've lost any ability to have empathy or compassion. i just feel like i don't care anymore.

i don't know what i'm asking for out of this, i just had to finally get it out. i really don't know what to do at this point. if i could i really wish there was a ""do over"" button that we could press and start again. i wouldn't make all the mistakes i've made in my life. i would try to not be so da\*n introverted when i was younger which made it hard to make friends. i would've traveled the world before my health made my ability to travel by air an iffy proposition. i would've tried more activities to maybe find a passion.

i don't anymore guys. it just all feels so hopeless. if i had to use one emotion to describe myself at this very moment i think that's the one i would use. hopeless.

feel free to reply with what you want. i'm alone again on a saturday night anyway. i've got nowhere else to be and nothing better to do.",1
post_00154,"i messed up and have so much regret. (edit: sorry if grammar is not good, english is not my first language).

a few years ago, i was overcome with anxiety and depression which led to me setting myself on fire and jumping out through a window falling feet first to the ground. the pain was the worst i had ever experienced. my parents were there and rushed me to a hospital. i spent the next years of recovery in pain and having even more suicidal thoughts. i lashed out on my parents quite a lot. my body had 2nd to 3rd degree burns and i had shattered my left foot's bones as well as a mild lumbar fracture. which made me in a wrong state of mind at the time. right now all my burn wounds have healed and had surgery done on my foot; i've recovered quite a lot and have been able to walk without crutches for quite a bit. despite all the suffering i've experienced, i was able to get through it by having a talk with my family a bit and a few friends who visited.

but i think what helped me the most was being able to change the way i look at things. for quite a while, i had a very negative outlook on everything and would more often then not just give up or find an excuse/reason to hate something/someone; i would avoid thinking about it, to solve it, talk about it, or even ask for help. one after another all negative thoughts just kept on piling up on me. and eventually, i just snapped. right now, i'm doing better. i still have so much anxiety, maybe even more than before, and my heart aches everytime i think about what i put my family through that i often cry before sleeping. but i've become more open about my thoughts/feelings and have started being grateful for a lot of things; that i am able to focus more on what i want to do going forward. 

i still have suicidal thoughts from time to time and try my best to ignore it, but there are just nights were i wished i had died years ago. maybe i wouldn't have had to experience all of this, though i know it's my fault for just holding in and not thinking things through. i just hope for the best now and learn to live with all these scars i've given myself.",1

post_00156,unsure. don't want to but also don't want to live. i dont feel like i have any reason to live honestly. no one has really ever loved me other than family. i work harder than anyone in anyone's life and i just get discarded. i don't want to die but i don't want to live. i feel like im at the mercy of how i feel in the moment. just waiting for the moment when the overwhelming sensation takes over and i can't move on anymore. i just want the person that was here before she cheated. i just want that love that we had back days before it happened. i know life is hard and people change but your change was abnormal. your change i believe is more on your mental health than our relationship... maybe you're happier without me? if you are then why do you keep calling about things that aren't important? why is this happening? why cant we just work through our issues and love again?,1

post_00162,"i don’t know what to do anymore god i know most people won’t read this but i really hope somebody does. first i want to start off by saying yes, i’ve been doing my best to help others on this sub. it helps me. i spent 2 hours on this sub refreshing the page and trying to offer advice and understanding. for some reason i struggle to follow my own advice, i know it might seem hypocritical but i feel that you can encourage others even if you are feeling similarly. for me it’s always helped. it makes me feel like i’m doing something good. i have autism, it’s something that most people don’t even see because of how well i’m able to mask it. honestly it doesn’t make my job harder or anything. i’ve always been good at talking to adults, ever since i was a kid. it’s been very helpful throughout my life with things like getting understanding and compassion from my teachers in school. having someone knowing what’s going on really makes things better. i don’t want to die, but i also don’t want to be alive. i want to kill myself but i have been unable too. i recognize that many people in my life deeply care about me, but it also makes me sad because it makes me feel like i have no reason to be depressed. i’ve dealt with depression since i was 8. i was bullied throughout the entirety of school. it changed me but not exactly in a bad way. my first suicide attempt was when i was only 10 years old. what a world we live it. people can be so ruthlessly cruel. i remember being in 2nd grade and people started telling me that “nobody liked me” and that “the world would be better off without me” legit it is horrifying looking back: teachers never did anything. parents, please check on your kids. i’m grateful for mine. my body is covered in scars, i’m embarrassed and it gets tiring having people always point them out and ask questions. i get a lot of judgmental looks. but i know that the people who are truly important and care, understand that sometimes things got so bad, it was the only thing i could do to stay alive. yes it may be unhealthy but at the  end of the day i’m still here. i’m 19. in 5 months i’ll be 20, i never expected to make it to 16, then i was sure i wouldn’t make it to 18, but 20? honestly i’m shocked. latley my suicidal thoughts have been worsening and i’ve started slowly having attempts to overdose. in fact last night i took so many pills i’m honestly shocked i’m still alive. i spent 2 hours just trying to help people, i’m thankful i found this sub. i guess i’m just venting here and saying everything i’m feeling so i can understand it better. it reminds me to allow myself to see that people really do love me and that i’m not a bad person. i’ve always been different, despite being bullied for it my entire life just about, i never let it take away who i was because that was all i had. i always say that no matter what you do and what you change about yourself, there will always be people who find things to pick apart. it’s better to be who you are and have people dislike you, than to be a person you’re not and have people still dislike you. i’m sorry i know this is very long. honestly the only thing keeping me from killing myself is my partner, and my job. my partner is struggling with medical issues and despite all our attempts to get help, we still can hardly afford his treatment. he is in pain and he told me two days ago that he is suffering. that destroyed me. he is the love of my life and gave me a reason to live again. the idea of getting married, having kids having a family, getting old together, makes me fight to make it to the next day. but it’s not easy, it breaks my heart and i know that if there is ever a time where it’s clear he will die, i will kill muself because i cannot bear to feel that agony. yes it may sound horrible and selfish but it’s just too much. i work in childcare, i am the “teacher” for preschool and twos. it makes me so happy, coming into work and seeing all the kids so ecstatic to see me, yelling my name running up to me for a hug, “we missed you we missed you” i’ve always been good with kids. yeah my job is hard but it’s rewarding. having parents tell me that they are so greatful for me and what i do, and hearing that the kids always talk about me, makes me feel so fulfilled. and because of that i always beat myself up for wanting to kill muself because my life isn’t all bad, and that makes me want to kill myself. i feel so frustrated and upset. i’ve again been on a lot of medication since i was 10. my depression is difficult because my brain is not properly able to produce serotonin normally, you can actually kinda see on a brain scan. i feel like i shouldn’t be alive because if it wasn’t for my medication i would be unable to survive. i think my attempts at od are affecting my heart because every time it causes me to have chest pain, irregular heartbeat, and just a very unwell feeling. my parents are starting to notice it. i might ask for them to keep my medication out of access, but i’m scared of them having me go to a psych ward. being autistic makes it so hard to do that because i just can’t survive in that environment, i was so unhappy and depressed when i was there when i was young. it honestly traumatized me. again i’m sorry this is so long. i just hate the feeling of feeling like i have no right to be sad because other people have it so much worse, and i feel frustration that no matter how hard i try i can’t love myself and i am often unable to see and believe that people want me to stay alive. i’ve never meant to hurt anyone but sometimes i feel like they’d all i do. i really don’t know what’s going to happen to me. i’ve slowly been eating less and less, or binging on favorite food. i hardly leave my room and the only reason i don’t lay in bed all day miserable is because of my job. anyways i’m sorry this is so long. i hope someone will read this and be sble to understand me because that’s all i want, i want to be understood.",1

post_00168,"i’m terrified of being a girl. i’m a 14 year old girl who’s weaker than average, i’m thin and short.
i hate being a girl so much. more than anything. if one day i had proof of reincarnation, i’d kill myself and hope i come back as a boy.
i’m scared of men, i’m scared because men are stronger. i hate that men are stronger. it’s the most humiliating thing. i hate being built for childbirth, i hate having a bigger chest and wider hips. it’s embarrassing. i want more than anything to be a boy. 
i look really feminine too, and i hate it so much. i’m seriously thinking about just ending it all.
i wish i was a boy so that i would be stronger, but also because i want to look like a boy and be treated like a boy and perceived like a boy. being a teenage girl in this disgusting, misogynistic world is the most demeaning and humiliating thing ever. knowing that i’m living off of peoples mercy.
i even have fantasies where i’m a boy and i look like a boy and i do things that i see my brother and father doing. in an ideal world, i’d be a man who loves and protects girls just like me so that they won’t have to feel this way. i want to fight and be strong, and everyone, including biologists, tell me i’ll never even compete to men, so i don’t even try. i don’t exercise, i don’t do anything. i’m severely depressed and anxious. i’m completely paranoid of the people around me, especially men. and it’s not just that, it’s that i want to be a man just because i do. i want facial hair and a deep voice and thicker eyebrows and an adam’s apple. i’m just so tired of this. i think i’m just going to end it all, because i can’t be a boy. i’ve gone through thinking about transitioning, but the world is so cruel and hateful towards trans people and i’m scared. the place i’m in has anti trans laws too. so i can’t be trans for my own safety. i’m just stuck being a girl. so it’s two choices:
be a girl or die.

edit:
guys i’m sorry for gender stereotyping.
there isn’t an excuse for my behaviour.
i’m sorry to all the people who i’ve offended and i’m sorry for undermining transmen issues and trying to include myself in them when i don’t belong in that space. i feel like i was being overly dramatic this entire time and i’m sorry to everyone who i’ve caused worry to. just because i’m sad does not mean i have the right to dump that on other people. i’m sorry everyone.
to everyone telling me to just go to a therapist or a professional, you’re right. it wasn’t right for me to throw my problems at a bunch of strangers.
i’ll call a helpline instead. thank you for all the help and support.

edit again:
upon looking at these comments, i’ve come to the conclusion that being a guy sucks too. being a girl also sucks. being nonbinary also sucks. people will continue to hate me for the rest of my life no matter what i do. based on my gender, but also my race. so i think i am going to kill myself.
i think in reality, i just hate being human, being a person. i hate existing. maybe this didn’t have much to do with gender at all. i think maybe i just hate myself and everything else. i don’t want to be a girl, i don’t have to be a boy, i don’t want to be anything. the only thing i genuinely want to be is something disgusting. something people won’t come near or bother. like a corpse, or a vampire, or a maggot. i don’t like myself and i’m coming to realize i don’t like many people either. i really appreciate all your guy’s help and advice though.

edit again again: please stop using she/her for me. i understand that it’s confusing because i referred to myself as a girl here, but i feel like i keep commenting and telling people and they don’t seem to listen? maybe i’m looking too deep into it. but please don’t. thank you.

edit again again again: guys can we please stop being so hostile to each other? i didn’t mean for this post to have dozens of angry arguments and profanity under it.

edit for the millionth time:
at first, when i posted this, i was just very depressed and upset. now i’m angry.
i posted this to a suicide subreddit looks for support, advice, conversation, or just a listening ear. but for some reason people are arguing with each other, being transphobic, calling other people names and even slurs?? not to mention the amount of transphobic people trying to ‘defend’ me against the ‘trans agenda’ when i do not need defending of any sort, because i don’t want it. i’m fine. this was a post about how i’m experiencing a difficult time, not an invitation to harass others and deliberately speak over me and try to talk for me. can we please just stop swearing at each other and attacking each other? this is honestly making me lose hope is society even further.

edit again: guys stop talking about me getting pregnant. it’s really uncomfortable. i made this post to look for help and support. instead i have lost faith in people and i’m honestly feeling worse. i’m 14, don’t pull that ‘oh but you might change your mind later’ because i don’t care. there are more reasons to me not being able to have a child that you guys don’t know about. i didn’t even mention pregnancy in this. i really wish people would stop bringing it up. i literally cannot be a mother, i’m too unstable and i can’t handle noise. i’m scared of children and i’m severely germaphobic. there are more reasons that i don’t want to list because this post is not about me getting pregnant! stop. please stop assuming you know me better than i know myself. i really really don’t appreciate it. so stop.

edit: i hate it here. i really thought that going on a suicide support subreddit would help me.
i know i said to ‘be respectful’ and ‘stop using profanity’ but fuck you guys. not all of you guys, some of you are really sweet. but really. i’ve officially lost faith in the internet, strangers, and human nature. for some reason someone was talking about how ‘being a woman is an opportunity for me to be a stripper’??? what the fuck??? i’m 14, that’s literally the first line of this post. but i can thank you all for something, thank you for reminding me why parents sometimes say ‘stranger danger’ because you guys are seriously pushing me closer to just ending it all—for an entirely different reason. now i just want to kill myself because i hate the world and myself. so thank you for that. i really appreciate it. and also, i know people have it worse than me, okay? i don’t need a reminder 10x a fucking hour. i’m just so sick of this shit and i’m sick of people in general. i really hoped that this would be a nice supportive subreddit where people could maybe give me advice, and they did! but like half of the people here are literally just subtly encouraging me.",1

post_00170,"want to but can’t… my contamination ocd is unbearable. two years ago i unwrapped my exhaust on my motorcycle in my garage and brought it inside rolling it up and tossed it in the trash. i learned two years later that calcium containing fiberglass combined with heated stainless steel makes a super toxic form of hexavalent chromium . i start googling and find studies of the workers who worked in heavy levels and how 20% of them died of lung cancer. i test my house with swabs all all come back negative except one specific spot where we hung some cheap leather bags from colombia (the use cr6 in leather tanning) . i can’t shakes the thought that i may have contaminated my home:

when i would eat too much he would comment on my weight and if i didn't eat he'd ask ""why?"" he made me feel self conscious about myself. he made me not want to eat and i remember doing sit ups everyday and started looking at my body in the mirror everyday and i'd starve myself. he'd question my sense of style and always comment on it.

post_00225,"my mental illnesses are incurable, i don't want to live like this anymore i have depression, anxiety, panic attack disorder, adhd, autism, and pmdd all diagnosed, including having parents and both sides of the family who are both mentally ill themselves. i assume most of my conditions were genetic.

i've tried all kinds of medications for 3 years straight, and they either worked for a tiny bit and stopped or made me much worse. the worst part about having so many conflicting conditions is that the medications may work for one condition but make the other one(s) worse.

i've been extremely angry and, with no better word to put it, overwhelmingly hysterical for days straight. my emotions are out of my control, my inner monologue argues with me and tries to convince me that everyone else and i would be better off if i was dead.

 every day i try to fight those thoughts and i get them every day just in daily life, but as i've learned, i end up starting to agree with the thoughts at some point.

all i do is cause problems for my family, and especially my mom who does all she can to help me. i've yelled at them some times and i've had no control over any of it. my mom tells me i pin my anger onto her. 

im just done, i can't keep this cycle going and i can't cope with my conditions that just keep getting worse as i continue living. the only cure is either some magical potion or just fucking killing myself.

 i don't have a plan and i'm scared to do it because of my pets and the chance that i survive the attempt and end up not functionable for the rest of my life. i also don't want my parents to grieve either. i just want to be cured and i want to stop hurting my family.",1

post_00227,"my despicable legacy today, as 25th may i've decided to kill myself. not sure if it's because i've finally gathered enough confidence, or if it's because i finally understand things i didn't before. i do not seek help, however, attention would be nice, to be heard at least one time in my life; to finally show the world my most secret flaws, my archivements, the things i've accomplished, the bad memories, overall: to finally tell my despicable legacy. 

i feel invisible. 

i've been invisible my whole life. while never completely ignored, always felt invisible. 
i feel alone, even when i'm with the ones that are close to me; it is something i've been trying to stop for around 10 years, but finally give up.

at first, i was born as an accident, i've never been told that, nor made feel that way, but is clear that a mother who is 19, and a father who is 21, didn't exactly planned a child outside even a stable relation. 
i was lucky to be born in a somewhat rich family. i lived with my mother, her parents and my uncle until i was 5, then moved to a flat, with my mother and her new husband. 
from 0 to 4 life was decently good, i don't personally recall any bad experiences, but i was told recently from my grandmother that i would usually cry and reject being taken from my home to hers. i don't know why. 
my dad was poor by that time, he was still studying as a ecologist. he was present, to be fair, he was more present when i couldn't remember. 

from 5 to 12 i lived in the flat i mentioned early. i was there alone most of the day. now i think, what kind of parent would leave a kid alone in a flat at the age of 5? well, one that clearly didn't care enough. at 6 i joined school, the same monotous hell i assisted for 12 years. i never really fitted with the average person. i wasn't an outcast, or a creep, i had friends. they weren't good friends, but they were friends after all. we would normally go to each other houses and play together, watch movies, etc. 
i never did good in school, i barely did decent. parents reacted in the only logical way they could think of, by beating me. luckily my mother and dad broke up when i was around 3, so each of them went their way. 
my father never, ever hit me. he was a rational man who believed in dicipline through love, tho he never showed me love. 
nothing particulary especial happened from the age of 6 to 12, besides being bullied by some classmates; leading me to bully the ones who were weaker than me, which i completely regret. 

at the age of 10 this odd feeling started in my chest, some kind of void? some kind of sucking force that was draining my energy, my happiness and somehow, my willing to live. i didn't understand it. i had no idea why it was happening. suddenly, the world was no more love painted. a great hatred towards this new enviorement grew in me. to see everyone as an enemy. years later i understood that was when my depression began, my daily prison, the loneliness i feel every day; that was the starting point. 
at 12, i cannot recall what was in especific that made me cut, but something made me look for some kind of redemption in flagellation. i enjoyed it to some degree. i never did it to a serious level, and i stopped fairly quick, it only lasted for around 6 months. months of carving my hatred and depression in my horrible body. 
i forgot to mention that i've been called, or been made feel ugly my whole life, untill today. so a natural doubt about myself, and my body arise, and it's been here with me since so long... 

at this point i'm a bit drunk. getting everything ready for my departure, as i listen to there's no beauty left here, amazing album. 

sadly i never got hug any significant another, let alone kiss. i never felt the love of someone else, never got to cuddle anyone, to trust, to love, to have sex with, to share my thoughts. i've always been by my own, i've always been alone. what saddens me the most, is that i've never been heard. i've always been ignored.

invisible. that's what i've been feeling like for about 4 years. 

everyone around me gets talked by others. others interact with others, but not me. 
it covers many aspects, not only been talked but... i don't know how to explain it. i am a somewhat smart person, but sometimes i believe i'm really invisible? 
sometimes i talk to people in real life, and they just ignore me? 
philosophy has been an interesting topic for me, yet i cannot answer myself. if i'm ignored like that, am i even there? was i part of a community? 

but this is about the good things i did, too. 
i joined the fire brigade. had a good time there, it filled myself more than any other activity, i helped men, women and children. tho it was never enough to bury the loneliness and emptiness i felt. 

i also rescued a kitty that was pregnant! i called her mamou, she had 4 little kitties which i gifted to people i knew who would take good care of them. 

but it's been 2 years since i've been living on my own, mamou died 3 weeks ago, which made me realize the futily of life. but overall, made something a bit more clear for me. it wasn't hatred what i felt for the world, but disappointment. we've come so far as a species. we have so much potential, but it's been wasted, and me myself i am guilty of this. i haven't done anything remarkable. 
i am disappointed at the selfishness, the antipathy, the greed, and the distancing of humans. 

for those reasons i am sorry for whoever will have to clean my body, or cremate it? i am sure my parents won't want a funeral for me. i mean, even less with whats going on with the world right now 

that leads me to my next point, betrayal, backstabbing and abandon. that's what some of my friends did to me. they ditched me out of their lives like a spent torch, like a used tissue. 
sure, i did a mistake, i admit it. i did many mistakes. but looking at them in a objective way, is not much different of what our true nature is, in other words, i never did something worth abandoning your friend, and then getting them fired of their job.

quarantine is fucked up, makes me realize that the little chances i had of meeting someone before, now are completely gone. tho it hasn't been all bad, i got fit. i lost a lot of weight. i've read hundred of classic and cult books, same for music. 

anyway, to the last point. the things i most regret in life? probably not being more myself, that would have probably brought more pain, but it is uncertain. 
i regret never meeting and loving someone, it was harsh seeing everyone around me find someone, everyone but me. 

if you made it this far, i cannot properly explain how much i appreciate the time you dedicated reading this. this is more attention than all the one i've been given through my whole life. it felt really good to open up after so long

i am tomás renard, these are the last words i want to say before leaving this world, and venturing into the next one. if anyone is concerned, know i will leave happy that at least read this post. i will leave with the only thing that has been here for me my whole life, a nice bottle of pipeño wine",1

post_00231,"i’m sorry guys i’m sorry everyone. tonight is the night. it was meant to be this morning but certain plans didn’t work out so i have to visit all my friends today instead. i’m gunna be giving people small things to keep because i don’t like the thought of my family doing one of those this-is-how-he-left-it things, it’s just feels like they would hold on too much. thank you for all you kind messages and comments, and please don’t hate yourselves if you tried to help me but couldn’t. i’m very useless when it comes to the help of others actually helping. i’m asking a girl i really like if she would just want to lay down in bed and hug, as i’ve really missed that human connection, but even if that does work out and we spend hours there hugging and talking, i’m still going to end it, because fuck the way my head works. thank you guys. i haven’t said this to anyone but my names josh, idk why i feel like i should mention it but idk man. good luck to you all, and hopefully i won’t be in pain for long. 

i will always miss you my love.

edit: i’ve been inundated with messages that i appreciate so so much. i’m still here surprisingly, i honestly thought i wouldn’t be by now. 

edit 2: hey guys, thanks so much for everything you’ve all said to me or messaged me, i really appreciate every single one of you. i’m sorry i haven’t replied to some people, but i’ve read every comment and they’ve helped me so much. i’ve decided i’m going home tonight. i’m giving myself another two days, and if i feel ok, another two after that. i hope everyone here can ask her the lo and help each other. i love you all 

edit 3: hi everyone, i want to thank you all so much for everything you guys said, it’s nice to know there are people out here that feel the same way, and i’m so awestruck by the help that you guys are also giving each other in the comments. the best description i could give right now is that my environment is still sharp, and everything i come into contact with hurts no matter the slightness of it. i’m still very very disregulated (not sure what the proper term is) and i’m finding it very hard to control the many impulses i do have. i haven’t been able to leave my room but i’ve still gotta go another day. i didn’t put it in my post but i suffer from bpd, so anyone else who is feeling like i am please read the comments. they are for you too, and anyone else who wants to take their own life. i might not end up making it much longer, but like i said i’m the previous edit, i’m going to give myself two days at a time, and if that doesn’t help just a day. if i don’t, please take this a pertinent reminder to reach out to absolutely anyone when you need help. seek medical advice if you can’t protect yourself, and always be kind to others. yeah you may have bad days, and you may hurt people that you care about, but those bad days don’t make you a bad person. i love you all so very much, and if i could take away the pain that you feel, i would in a heart beat. 

edit 4: good luck everyone. i can’t do it. i hope all your lives are full of love and life. i really wish i was better but i’m better off dead. if my family ever see this i love you more than anything on this earth, and i wish things could have been different. i’m not going to rely or activists this account anymore as i don’t want to be stopped. thank you to everyone for their kind words 

edit 5: got taken to the hospital by police, family came and picked me up. i may get help soon but i don’t think it will be for a while. i’m going to keep the post up but i won’t respond to any comments. i’m sorry i can’t keep coming back and feeling the same. thank you for all the help, i hope i can get past this.",1

post_00238,don’t want to jump alone  i wish there was a way to find someone else in my city feeling the same way as i do so that we can both jump together. i’m scared to do it alone. and i know it’s stupid and i don’t even know why i’m so scared to do it because i know the pain won’t last after i jump. it will be painful but quick. they put bars on the bridge to deter people and so that moment of climbing over them wondering if anyone would see scares me too. even though again it doesn’t matter because i will be dead. idk guys. i just feel so hopeless and alone.,1
post_00242,"bye guys. i had a good run. 21 and as invincible as mark grayson.

i guess it’s funny that my last few moments are spent here on reddit. maybe my karma will help me reach enlightenment or some shit.

my last meal is gonna be some soup i’m making.

update: my wife talked me out of it last night. the soup was good. not my last meal after all. we’re going to eat some for breakfast together. i really love her.

update: sorry i can’t reply to everyone. i wanted to say thanks for the support and messages, guys.",0
post_00243,"i think i should end everything i was wondering if i ended myself, maybe my father would care about our family more. maybe my mother would stop lashing out on us everytime they have a fight. but i worry so much that maybe if i do end myself, they would follow the same path.",1
post_00244,"is being passively suicidal a thing? i’m a 14-year-old genderfluid person, and i feel what i think i can best describe as passively suicidal. i have no intention of directly killing myself, but i just don’t have any will to go on. it’s hard to articulate, but i feel kind of like if, for example, a car hit me and i was, say, bleeding out, i wouldn’t call 911 and try to save myself. is this a thing? what should i do?",1
post_00245,"can someone just read this because i'm not going to tell my family anything and i'm just going to disappear tbh. i just want someone to know. i think i'm going to get plastic surgery.

i'm so done being trapped in this ugly, unfixable body.

i've tried everything, women that i desired only liked me when i was on steroids and without that... poof. realized that it is all about looks and the rest are just minor factors that aren't gamechangers at all. 

id have to rot away in the gym getting unhealth lean just to be good looking enough, struggling just to be good enough for some shit i wanted in life and not just getting shit for almost killing myself trying to change

tried getting hobbies o plenty, boxing, bodybuilding, music. nothing makes me fulfilled anymore, nothing at all; exercise is distracting and fun but i can't constantly do that (tried, not a good idea). i hate doing things that cause me to sit and do nothing such a video games now becaue i just feel like a loser. dating apps don't work for me anymore at all, all my exes went to better guys than me.

never had luck with dating or social experience when i was younger and lived in the shadow of my pretty, better sister. i was bullied too and i was suicidal in hs pretty much since i was 14.

now i've been through countless ""relationships"" that were all off of dating apps and was never taken seriously by the other person and only lasted maybe a month at best, always ended up being the one dumped and treat shitty and when i got those opportunities i was on steroids and i had a marvelous body. i feel pathetic.

i have a fine personality but personality means nothing to anyone if they don't deem you attractive, your just a loser weirdo; this translates to professional life too.

i'm doing mewing and looksmaxxing and penis enlargement, i just wanted to be happy and not have to sit here looking at other in my family living those good lives and then seeing my sister and not being able to help being bitter and constantly depressed seeing me still the joke in the shadows as she's in her third year of a long distance relationship, happy and fulfilled.

i can't grow a mfing beard or anything; dad has a full one. losing my hair. i've tried everything it seems and i hate looking at my life and knowing i'll always feel this way as long as i stay like this.

if i can't get plastic surgery, i already have hppd from drug abuse as a teenager, i find no reason to keep going i just want to end my life. i feel stuck under all the weight of all this and just would rather end it.
 
the hppd was hard fucking enough with the anxiety and nobody in my family believing me. they all treat me like i was crazy and it made me stop caring about myself. i still don't care anymore, they wonder why.

i've found god but, it doesn't make it much better... i feel a little comfort but comfort in that of death.

otherwise i just get stoned all the time now to not think about how shitty i feel.

i feel like i don't even have motivation to clean my house because nobody actually comes here to be with me at all. 

friendships are unfulfilling and im now 23 going on 24. everyone is meeting someone and i met nobody.

i used to pray and beg to god why i was like this. nothing changed. i'm planning to go in the army since i graduate this june with a bs but it means nothing and doing my college knowing all this make it hard to keep trying and going.

if this shit doesn't work, i'll just end it; no sense going on, ive tried to end it before, nothing changed; just kept getting more miserable once at 17 another two times at 22. i see what happens to people that are alone for years as they get older and older, they become more bitter and angry and then they just kill themselves. people in my bloodline have done it.

i had to get it off my chest. i feel like i'm constantly suffering and i can't take it anymore. i have no fucking idea what i've done in this life or past life to deserve this shit.

i told my mom about this not the whole extent of how i put it in this post but you get the idea but i've been trying to spend more time with her; never had a good relationship when i was younger due to a messy divorce and a narc dad. 

and i can't keep living for my family or whatever, i've never been able to just to be happy for myself; i always have to be happy for others and never just get to feel happy and proud of myself.

my family tells me they love me but it means very little, id rather just be dead. people can love you non romantically but the extreme polarity of life experiences is too much and it nullifies the meaning of it.

i'm tired of being to told to love myself by people and my family, you cannot ""love"" yourself without being loved that way, in a meaningful way, i've tried over and over and over for years! im tired of living in denial and coping; it is pathetic and weak. everyone thinks it when they look at it and say ""glad i'm not that guy."" 

living in this life isn't worth it if you don't have good things and contentness. i have never been happy as long as i can remember, never a true, secure, happiness and i have never been proud of myself. all this shit with school being hard and being proud doesn't matter; that's all i've fucking done for years and years trying to cope with this shitty life that every day i woke up and lived, hated, and dreamt of having a better one 

i had to tell someone i hope some reads this, prob gonna delete this post and account in the next few days so an employer doesn't find this, i still have bills to pay, even if the day that i don't have to anymore is in the near future",1
post_00246,"don’t you just hate when you wake up and your still alive? i just want to be dead so bad but i’m such a wuss to do so. honestly what’s a better way to kill myself, getting hit by a train or jumping off a bridge? really thinking about just getting ran over and shredded by a train. been reading up about that way and seems pretty foul proof and seems like not much can wrong.

i’m afraid to jump off a bridge and some how survive with my whole body broken and if that happened holy i don’t even know what i would do at that point.

my will to live has been low recently, for at least a year. i’m so stressed about this schedule, i’ve never had a schedule like this. i’m worried having to somehow wake up at 3 in the morning and the inevitable sleep deprivation will make my mental health worse. i know i should just wait and see, that maybe it will be ok or i won’t work that shift for long. it sounds weird to say but as i type this i realize i’m actually afraid somehow. this might be the wrong subreddit, i just want to make sure i don’t end up not getting any sleep and being so stressed and tired that i do something drastic. for now i want to be excited about a new job. i don’t want to be scared of something i was excited about a few days ago.",0

i already had issues with depression and suicidal thoughts and this whole situation is making it worse. 
each day i think about ending my life before i can even admit it to anyone, i've been hiding it from my family, friends, boyfriend although he's suspecting at this point because its becoming *very* visible unless i wear big clothes, he has also noticed that i'm acting off and that im clearly distraught and anxious all the time.

 i love him so much, and we have a healthy relationship, but this stupid mistake is making me feel like i failed him and myself, i look at him and start crying and feel my heart breaking, i dont want to lose him but i'm too depressed to handle myself, let alone a fucking child. i don't know what to do anymore, everyday i hope either i or the fetus dies, the shame is too fucking unbearable to keep on living i just want to get this over with without a single soul knowing.

when i do sleep, my dreams are haunted. they do not let me think. for nearly three years i dealt with being told i am not enough, that i am ugly, to go die and finally the last thing you said was ""fuck you"" after i wanted the truth of why you had that girl in the background. she's even on your steam account. i have wondered if you have her on tumblr too, and other online entities. worst part is, i know there's more. you didn't care about telling the truth, you pretended you had no idea who i was talking about, you played dumb. you acted like you did nothing at that party with anyone, but you were vague and didn't keep your word about remaining in contact with me. 

i know i’ve only been a burden because i am in the way of your desire to cheat and have sex with as many people as possible. even after i told you that you were the only one for me, after i tried to express my feelings and love for you, you still wanted all the people in your phone. this time, you can have them and i wont be sad. this is my chance to be selfless like you wanted, to give you to other people. the only way i can do that is to be numb. 

i tried acting like everything will be fine. i know deep inside that it's not, and never will be.

to my mom, i love you, this is not your fault, and i know my child hood has impacted me as an adult. i'm sorry for not cutting him off sooner, and realizing he doesn't love me like you said. i can’t pretend anymore, no more fake smiles from me. don't hold this against yourself, you did nothing wrong, i am weak and i need peace. 

to my brother, my childhood friend and someone who has supported me. it was never about you. i love you, don't take this too hard. just know that i am happy and i am not suffering anymore.

to my sisters: i am distant from you, but we were very close when i was younger. not one of you had the time to ever visit but you had the time to travel a lot. i however am a decade younger than you so i couldn't afford to go out to visit. i was going to write something else in regard to you never visiting, instead i want you to know i love you and i hope you lead fulfilling lives. 

to the father of my children, i love you very much like family. even though we didn't work out i hope you live your life without any regrets. you are worthy of a good woman, and i know you will meet her one day. love her and love her hard. make sure she is someone that loves our kids. 

to the people who believed in me, there is nothing you could have done to distract me from my grief, from my broken heart. no words can fix this, don't worry about not seeing the signs because there weren't any. when someone you love so deeply says and does things that break you there is no comfort that any one can give you, not even from myself.

and while as the pathetic worthless low value man i am, i can not even commit the simple heroic act of removing my inferior genes from the genepool through efficent means. to blow your brains out, jump in front of a train, burn yourself, i could've chosen so many ways.

&#x200b;

but here i am now hoping to perish. eventually my body has to determine it has to shut down hopefully completely. i don't feel any pain from it anymore, in fact i feel nothing slowly becoming a husk.

i can still think clearly, in fact that is what i wish i couldn't. i can think so clearly that i'm hoping to die even more.

while i write this feel all the futility of existence wrap around me, hugging me lovingly, more than a lover ever could, not that i've ever known what a lover will ever feel like ever in my life, or a hug in general that is, not even from a mother.

&#x200b;

not eating have saved a great deal of money, i used it on material goods that makes me forget the agony my body tries to remind me of. though slowly the dopamine will stop producing in my brain, it has already happened somewhat. my passions of creativity has no meaning anymore, they're all just a symbolism of emposing death on myself in a vague form.

&#x200b;

leaving a legacy is the kind of thing a lot of people tend to think about when they're decide to throw the match of chess with the reaper on purpose. it has been on mind all my life really, but not just a material or symbolic legacy but an actual physical one, a family to go on.

but that is not to be, i've reached the point where it's not possible, there is no hope now. and as i view even my material goods and symbols obscure into the black holes just like everyone elses i realize how little purpose there is in anything at all. i don't wanna be here anymore.

and meanwhile as you skim over these useless words and symbols, it could be that i might've finally went to sleep.

&#x200b;

hopefully to never wake up ever again.

post_00288,"school starts tomorrow :/ no no no no no no no no no no no

i've been feeling way less sucidal  and i've been doing productive things like learning editing and i've been having fun.

school starts and i will be back to feeling suicidal again. school is literally hell. i've stopped cutting myself but school will make me do it again probably.

please no :( i want to stay here at home.

in school i do nothing but sit myself in the school toilet wishing it will be over. the loneliness is so strong. st home i can fill my time out and ignore it. in school i have to face it. i'm scared because i'm not ready.

this got way more attention than i expected. thanks everyone.  i'm going to see how it goes...

and i can't have online lessons for multiple reasons because we have no lockdown and it would require a explanation to my parents",1
post_00291,"i might kill myself👍 there is nothing going wrong in my life. my two childhood cats died a few months ago, but i got over it surprisingly quickly. i have made tons of new friends, some of the teachers that didn't really like me are starting to like me now, and this year is going to be the 9th year of me and my best friend's friendship.

i have never really thought of killing myself. sure, i have attempted before but i wasn't thinking of what i was doing, i just wanted to do it because i had some problems happening. right now is the first time im really considering it, im thinking what would be the right time to do it and how i will do it, i think overdosing is the easiest.

recently i have become more aggresive with myself, i slap myself hard across the face whenever a minor problem happens (phone lagging, dropping something, forgetting something, etc). i also punch myself and rip my hair, i don't know why i do it. i just do

ive stopped caring about things, i couldn't care less about people i love anymore, whenever i used to get into a fight with my bestfriend i would bawl my eyes out and nearly throw up because of how i scared i was of losing them. i got into a fight with them 3 days ago, i didn't give a fuck. i moved on and continued doing whatever i was doing. we are still friends, and the fight was about something stupid, but even when they used to get slightly mad at me i would think it is the end of the world. i don't care for my mother or father anymore, it feels exhausting to care for someone so i just stopped.

i have stopped depending on them aswell, i've stopped depending on alot of people actually. it feels like i have just compeltely given up, and i find that okay.

i don't have any problems at this moment but im thinking of killing myself, probably sunday.

my birthday is in a little more than a month so i kind of want to wait, but at the same time i don't really care about aging anymore",1
post_00293,"i could use a listening ear right now. undecided  im thinking about leaving my apartment door cracked, my two cats with a 22lbs of cat food and lots of pots of water. my apartment door will be slightly ajar so my neighbors can check on my body find and adopt my cats. in suffering so badly. i weigh 450lbs, i don't have any freinds none of my family talks to me, i was homeless years and now i'm not. i'm still not happy. i pull 60hrs a week. my body aches and hurts. i'm 25 f and i haven't lived.

no one wants to date me. 

i want to commit so i wouldn't have to suffer anymore, i'm so sick of suffering, everyone at my job hates me. i'm so fat and awkward.",1
