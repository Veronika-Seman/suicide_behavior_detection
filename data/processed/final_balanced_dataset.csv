post_00001,"i have pretty bad dyslexia, but for the first time as an adult i've read 3 full books since the beginning of august! 3 whole books! i have no one to tell, because it's not really an achievement, but to me it feels like a big deal, the highlight of my year. no one around me really seems to care, because if we are being honest, it's not really that big a deal, especially because i am a grown man of 31yrs old. 
but to me this has been such an invigorating achievement!
  
  
 all my life i have struggled with my reading, comprehension and learning. it's not that i cannot read, i can, it's just that it always feels like a huge chore, i get mixed up at times and have to re-read, and wherever possible i always avoid reading out loud, as some how i get things muddled up in my head and never read things accurately. i made my way through my school days always messing up and being teased and laughed at because of the slow pace of my reading. because of this i made a big effort to make sure that as best i could i would never allow my professional career to be effected, i wanted to insure that all my emails and work would be of the highest standard, i wouldn't allow myself to look stupid as an adult. which for the most part i have been able to do, but a quick glance at my posts and comments will show that i am still prone to mistakes, which of course on reddit means you are totally spell and grammar checked instantly and belittled if you slip up. reading even on here mostly feels like work, it takes my brain a large amount of extra effort to accurately read anything, i get ""strain"" headaches and quickly tire when reading, even if it's short titles on posts. 
 
 
so for me reading has never been my idea of fun or enjoyable, it's always been a step towards learning or work and i've never gotten beyond that with my attempts at reading for pleasure. i am a big fan of military history and of medical study to do with emergency medicine or first aid, i even studied at becoming a paramedic for a short time before my study opportunity was abruptly ended. so in a way i find those subjects the easiest to begin to read in. one of the first books i've ever read that wasn't because of study or school, was the diary of anne frank, it took me 2yrs to finish cover to cover, but i was 17yrs old and it was my first ever book away from school and i still felt accomplished! i found a series of books, 4 in total that were first hand fictional stories based around the real conquest of genghis khan, imagined stories about his planning and conversations etc. i took me 7yrs to complete the books, but at 26yrs i decided that recreational reading wasn't for me. at age 29 after watching the series band of brothers for about the 50th time, i brought myself major richard ""dick"" winters book, recounting the events of wwii from his vantage point. it combined my love of military history with my love of the tv series, and over a 6 month period i read the book. but it still really really took so much effort. 
 
 
now with covid-19 effecting everything, and a prolonged bout of severe illness on top of my disability, combined with a less than ideal living situation and battling my chronic depression after attempted suicide earlier in the year, i found myself with a tremendous amount of time, isolated in my tiny bedroom bored out of my mind which was further whittling at my mental health. i picked up a book entitled sas: ghost patrol, which was a historic telling of the very beginnings of the sas fighting with a special unit known as the long range desert group, who specialised in crazy daring deadly raids on the nazis in northern africa during wwii, and focused on a hugely brave and bold attack on a nazi port of tobruk. i began reading, and soon i was realising that i was reading well into the early hours of the night, night after night! and just like that i had finished the book, in less than 3 weeks! i had actually thoroughly enjoyed it! then i picked up the next, and then the next and soon within a short 8+/- weeks i had completed 3 books, three entire books read and most crucially enjoyed! i am so excited and proud of myself! i just had to tell someone. i have just picked up my next booked entitled ""march battalion by sven hassel""!  thank you for listening.
 
 
 
edit: wow! this has blown up far beyond what i ever thought possible! thank you so so much to everyone for sharing such kindness and support! it's a bit overwhelming. i have tried and will try to get a reply to everyone who comments, but incase i don't i hope no body is upset, because there is hundreds of comments and i am struggling to read them all in a timely fashion! also a big big thank you to everyone for the awards, i received my first platinum award today, which is just wow! thank you! 

also i've found a link to a website with simulates what it can be like for those of us with dyslexia or other learning difficulties when trying to read. [dyslexia simulator](http://geon.github.io/programming/2016/03/03/dsxyliea)",1

i just need $750 and then $50 so he can go celebrate me passing. i wonder what the best way to go is so he can donate my organs? i heard if you donate them you can get paid a lot. that way i'll be worth something. ",0
post_00006,"it does not make sense for me to want to die. i have no history of trauma. the only slightly bad thing that has ever happened to me is that my mother abandoned me when i was a baby, but i had my wonderful grandmother who stepped into that role, and i could not have asked for anyone better to raise me. i have friends who love and care about me. i have a job with steady and reasonable pay, and even my coworkers like me and talk to me every day. i am a student at a great college, which i am on mental health leave from, but i am free to return whenever i want. 


there is so much good in my life, so much going for me, that it feels like a slap in the face to people with actual problems that i want to throw that all away. so what that my grandma and my dad hate that im trans? there are people who get kicked out onto the streets for that. i should just get over myself and not care whether they use a damn pronoun or not. why should it matter that my dad is mean to me? people have fathers that beat and rape them, and my relationship with mine was good up until a few years ago. 

logically i know that suicidal thoughts are a symptom of depression, so that should make it easier for me to overcome them. its not really what i want, just my brain telling me its what i want. so why am i still planning to kill myself on sunday? why would i let a disorder take my life when it has so much promise? but i cant make myself care about any of it anymore. i dont care about my future. its selfish, but i barely even care about leaving everyone behind anymore. im not special and im not that good of a person, so they should be able to move on just fine. i know it will hurt, but i dont contribute much to anything. im lazy and a little stupid. 


my best friend wished me a happy birthday today and said they love me and theyre glad im here. my reaction was to feel sad that there are people who love me so much that theyd be utterly devastated if i died, and it frustrated me that i cant kill myself guilt free. what kind of person thinks like that? someone so selfish they dont even deserve to be alive. my friends and family deserve someone better who wouldnt even dream of leaving them behind like that. so does my cat. i tried writing out a note and individual texts for everyone, and there were so many to do that it got overwhelming, so what does that say? 

the one thing making me hesitate is that it will hurt or that it wont work and ill just end up in a psych ward again. usually i skip the step of attempting and just check myself in for a while because oding isnt that great of a method in terms of reliability and pain. those times i knew i didnt really want to die. i just wanted help and for things to get better. but im very tempted to try on the off chance that i can get it right. i couldnt conceptualize death back then like i can now. im pretty sure it wouldnt feel like anything, and thats what i long for. i dont want to exist. i want to feel nothing. 

there must be some hope for me because i decided to stay alive long enough to turn 22 and to watch timothe chalamet on snl, so maybe i can try sticking it out even beyond that. i counted my grandmas blood pressure pills, and i read that a man died taking about half of the amount i have access to, so im pretty sure if i actually had the guts to do it, it could work. it would be very unpleasant, im sure, but it probably would get the job done. 

if anyone actually read all of this, thanks for listening, and i hope you stick around to find out if life has better things to offer. very hypocritical of me to say, but i mean it.",1
post_00007,"""have you made any plans to kill yourself?"" difficult question to answer doc.

i've planned how i'd do it in detail thousand of times, but have i planned it in the sense of how i'd plan to go to the mall and buy a new coat on tuesday evening? no.

no timeframe, just a very detailed get-out clause for if i stop being able to handle this bullshit life any more. so i don't know if that counts as making plans or not.",0
post_00008,"worried my life is over before it even had a chance to begin. my whole life story. not set up to succeed. kept imprisoned since birth. you may have heard most of this before. but now i am sharing it publicly on my main account. because i am desperate and no longer have any shame or fucks left to give. there is no life for me here and i have felt suicidal all my life and almost committed suicide last year because i can't find a way to escape. i can't let this be my life and this is pure torture and torment, so i was going to escape the only way that was available.

no one has my best interest in mind and they treat me like i don't matter. like my needs don't matter and like i don't deserve a good life. i was born in a really bad place (a third world country) where i don't belong, i don't share any values or worldviews with them, and nothing about this place is normal to me or reflects who i am at all. there is no life for me here. i didn't have a life, a childhood, or any relationships with anyone i love or respect. i hate this place and always have. i was abandoned as a newborn, but it's not like it matters, since the people who adopted me have not given me a good life, because, quite frankly, no one here can give me what i need. they think a good life is superfluous. but they were especially abusive, and even people here would probably agree. they are religious extremists, moralists, and pro-life. i am irreligious and pro-choice. i used to be an atheist/materialist (even as a kid i never believed in their religion, they could never condition me), now i am quite spiritual/idealist and woo woo. but still very much an individualist and independent thinker. i am not a realist or practical. i believe in the impossible. i am very sensitive, so being in this hostile environment that is not aligned with my soul's truth is really harmful and distressing.

i don't know how this was allowed to happen to me. the fact that they think they know what's best for me or that they are my people or that they are good for me when they have abused me my entire life and i feel so uneasy and disturbed by their presence is so unsettling. i have nowhere to turn to. this place is so crowded. i hear everything and just being in this environment is so disturbing. even in my room. i can't get any peace. and knowing that if i open the door and go outside it gets much worse. even if i was in a soundproof box. i would still feel disturbed by just being here. just because it's normal for them, it's not normal for me. nothing about this place is normal. and they treat me like i'm the problem and that i am crazy and i am not allowed to feel the way i feel and think like i think. that who i am inside doesn't matter. they think they own me and that i belong here, when i don't. they are not my family. just hearing their voices makes my skin crawl. they never were. but they keep getting away with this. this is not my life. i need to leave.

i just want to be able to live life unburdened by the expectation to be someone i am not. and free from this fake identity and role that were imposed on me and do not reflect me in the slightest.

they think i am the problem and it took me a while to heal from the damage of the years of being invalidated and gaslit, including by the dozens of therapists i was forced to see. no matter who i talk to here, and explain i've been psychologically abused by my parents, they always take their side and say i should be grateful and have nothing to complain about, and that i need help, but not in a nice way, they just think the way i think is wrong. that i should be grateful i don't technically live in a slum, and that i was adopted, that i am educated (when everything i know i had to teach myself), that i am not starving. and, like, i have nothing. i don't have a life, i have none of my needs met, but i am expected to give up who i am and live for other people i don't even like, people i absolutely hate, because the little that i have is apparently too much. that i should just accept this and stop complaining. they are unwilling and unable to understand me and the extent to which they have wronged me. they think they own me, and that i shouldn't have a choice as to who i am. i need to leave.

i don't understand why i am expected to have to deal with this and talk to these people and have to interact with people who disturb me to my core, and be surrounded by them, being forced to hear them playing their disgusting music. i literally have to have something playing 24/7 on my headphones, so i don't hear what's going on outside and the noises people make, because then i am reminded of them and who i am surrounded by. i also can't meditate or listen to something relaxing, because some of the outside noise will seep through and ruin the vibe and throw me off completely and make me panic. i have to wait until i literally pass out every time i sleep because i can't just lie down quiet, it's not my thoughts that are the problem, it's the environment and noises that don't let me relax, and i am pretty sure i wouldn't have to worry and would be easier for me to dismiss scary and intrusive thoughts if i knew i was safe, but i am still here. i am still in the dangerous situation. i watched a reading a few weeks ago that summed up a lot of what i am having to deal with pretty well, she said what she was picking up on was ""the dichotomy between how you feel within your own being and what you know to be your truth spiritually, versus what the world shows you and how the world treats you"". it's about the fake life i am forced to live and about how people project their stuff and expectations onto me here and that it's an ugly duckling type of scenario. they could never do right by me.

i have really tried up until a couple of years ago, i went to therapy, i sort help, even saw a few local spiritual practioners, but they only ended up doing more harm than good because of their perspective and how they see the world, i am glad it didn't work out because i was seeking help from the wrong people, people who could never understand me or my needs, i literally couldn't physically continue this charade or pretend to have this fake life, or having to continuously interact and deal with them and have that be my life. and i came to learn that was the correct thing to do, gave me some peace of mind and brought me back to my energy. me having to ""live"", work, study here, interact with them, i couldn't do that. it would destroy my soul, and just being here does. every time i am forced to talk and interact with them is torture. they don't care about me and my feelings or well being, i don't care about them either, this situation doesn't benefit anybody, they are energy vampires and survive off draining me, they know that once i am gone, they will stop being able to feed off my precious and rare energy, they just want to dim my light because they know what i have and am, they could never have that or be that.

someone left me somewhere, at a sort of social work department of a maternity hospital when i was approximately 2 weeks old, and what had happened to me up until that point is a mystery.

it's really messed up because in my adoption papers it says that someone was handed me to hold by presumably my mother nearby the hospital while they would make a phone call and they would come back and never did, but then apparently someone talked to the people who worked there a nurse at the time, and she said what she heard from the people who worked at that department that it was my mother herself, a teenager apparently who went to the social work department directly and left me there and didn't provide any identifiable information and they just let her leave.

and then i was put up for adoption. but anywhere i ended up here would have been just as bad. they came up with this whole story that the person who got handed me on the street, was handed me by an east asian lady, so confusing, it's what's on my adoption papers, but there aren't many people other than locals here, because who would want to immigrate here, and i did one of those genealogical dna tests in order to find who did this to me, and never got a close enough match, but i am not of asian descent, they just said that because to them i looked like it when i was a newborn, so they just came up with this whole story to cover up for her, and they didn't take a name or anything. probably gave birth to me in the hospital and was told to bring me back later, and forego the whole adoption process.

so cover ups, deceit, and lies from the off. a whole conspiracy against me. there is no one or no where i can turn to. i was told all the time as a kid, that i was a bad person, and should live in fear of some karmic retribution, consequences, and having to pay. that i was a liar, and a bad person, and that life was going to get me (when it already had. they were trying to make me fear hell, when i was already in it, lol), when the reality was they were just too strict. and also being told that you have to work hard and toil and suffer and that life is struggle and sacrifice. they just made me live in fear. that at any point i could lose anything. and things could get worse. and i would just have to learn to live with it. and they told me that life is sacrifice and struggle. and that suffering is somehow a virtue. they have no concept of quality of life, mental well being, or hobbies. anything. they don't know what that is. they don't care that i wasn't set up to succeed, no one here cares about that. they think life here is normal.

my parents made me get into local universities four times. and every time i had to take this stupid exam, because they don't have something like an sat exam or a-levels, and i had to take this exam every year and can't ever reuse the scores or anything. but i would attend the first few classes and then start skipping and going to the library to be on my laptop because i literally couldn't physically bring myself to attend them. like, they don't have many course options here, nothing interesting, and it's a very closed off country to the world, the way they teach things is wrong. everything they teach is so wrong, they are so closed off to the world at large and really ignorant about stuff. so, it's not like a course i could sit through. i couldn't have a job here or have most of my time be spent listening or talking to these people living this fake life.

there is no institutional support here and i have spent all my life in therapy and they have done me more harm than good, people here don't know what quality of life and wellbeing is. i have had to learn myself to undo the damage they have done to me.

i have literally been forced to interact with those people for decades now, i literally can't stand this anymore. i feel like i will go insane and start banging my head against the wall or something if i am forced to have a life here and have to interact with these people.

i can't even bear to be here. i will never feel good here. this is agony and torture. life is asking too much of me. to figure out a way out and to have some mental and emotional well being. well, i can't whilst living in this place. it's just not conducive to that. i don't know what i am supposed to do. i can't be okay with everything going on around me and just being here. i can't be focused or at peace or have a game plan. i can't function at all. i can't do anything about the situation and i can't bear to even be in this country. i might start banging my head against the walls. how can i do anything? be expected to focus on anything and just be fine when i am in this shithole. i will never be happy in this place. i am not okay. i need help. and it's not available. not mental health help. they have tried for years to ""fix"" me with therapy and meds. i am too good for this place. i will never be happy or feel good or even function here. no institutional help, i have no rights, nowhere to turn to. well, this place is the problem. can't go asking for help from the people that are the problem and have harmed me. not that i haven't tried. and i want nothing from them anyway. they literally can't understand me. i can't stand all the gaslighting and abuse. this place is the bane of my existence and my personal hell.where i am being forced to live is the reason for all my trauma, there is no quality of life here, it is a culture i don't belong in, i am being abused, there is no life for me here and i am constantly disturbed to my core by the surroundings and external stimuli, because this place is unsettling and disgusting. and i can't do anything to leave because of my debilitating anxiety, ocd, intrusive thoughts. i am in constant fight or flight mode and mid-trauma and have been for all my life.

i struggle with constant intrusive thoughts and ocd. i feel like i spend 24/7 battling them and fending my deepest fears off. they are mainly thoughts of me becoming someone i am not (someone from this place), or that i could start thinking and feeling like them or find this place appealing. those who are familiar with pure o and intrusive thoughts know they attack your core identity and values and try to convince you that you are or could become someone completely opposite to what you are.

i just feel this constant threat looming over and that i have to be hypervigilant, because sometimes the intrusive thoughts come so i have to keep reassuring myself all the time of my true opinions and feelings about things, and try to keep them at bay, and sort of worried about doing enough to correct the intrusive thoughts when they come. because i can't find myself in the things around me and this environment and there are a lot of projections and expectations on me to be someone that is the opposite of what i am, so it's like my mind and my sense of self is the only thing i have and that's so at odds with reality and circumstances, and this ""life"" right now and the people i have surrounding me. i have always felt like i had to protect my self and my whole identity and being was constantly under threat.

this has always felt like an ugly charade they have put together just to torture me, and it feels like i am stuck in this nightmare. life is asking too much of me. when all i have needed since i was a child was safety, security, and a home and i never had that. it's a miracle i have survived this far. i remember thinking when i was a kid that no one in the history of humanity had suffered as much as i had or felt like that, even if their circumstances had been worse on paper, because that was my personal hell and i feel things very deeply. and honestly, i am still kind of convinced no one has. 27 seven years. people get less time for murder.

if it's not clear from the text, i am being forced to ""live"" in a squalid third world shithole, and people here are extremely ignorant and backwards.

there is no one or no where i can turn to. i was told all the time as a kid, that i was a bad person, and should live in fear of some karmic retribution, consequences, and having to pay. that i was a liar, and a bad person, and that life was going to get me (when it already had. they were trying to make me fear hell, when i was already in it, lol), when the reality was they were just too strict. and also being told that you have to work hard and toil and suffer and that life is struggle and sacrifice. they just made me live in fear. that at any point i could lose anything. and things could get worse. and i would just have to learn to live with it. and they told me that life is sacrifice and struggle. and that suffering is somehow a virtue. they have no concept of quality of life, mental well being, or hobbies. anything. they don't know what that is. they don't care that i wasn't set up to succeed, no one here cares about that. they think life here is normal.abandoned and left behind to rot and be misunderstood, abused and psychologically tormented, and expected to live a fake life. i can't get out of this on my own. but people are unwilling to acknowledge that i am not the problem, i have been wronged. and i can't pull myself out of this situation on my own. i am in a disturbing environment that disturbs me to my core, surrounded by abusers. if my needs were acknowledged i wouldn't be in this mess.

i have spent all of my teenage years and up until a couple of years ago. going to the therapist every week. and gone through many psychiatrists and psychologists and prescribed all the depression and anxiety medications there are. honestly, everything they have told and how they treated me only did me more harm than good. nothing they have ever said has ever helped. completely ineffective treatments, it's almost like i wasn't the problem and it's the case that i am in a traumatic situation and don't have my needs met. i have been working on myself and undoing the damage that they have done. started listening to myself. only after i went off on my own, and started awakening spiritually that's when i started, well, finding myself, and that, you know, acknowledging my own needs and seeing how abused and wrong i was, because all they could do before was gaslight me and side with my parents. and i used to be really depressed and pessimistic, the most pessimistic person ever, now i have found hope within, you know, even when i used to think the only way out of this was to off myself, it was from a place of self-respect and self-love, and not resining myself to these circumstances i was optimistic and looking forward to getting a new life, hopeful for a new life. i was looking to the future with a sense of hope and possibility. so, yeah. i know enough about this place and how things work here, and also, you know, not wanting to deal with them because they disturb me, and i know they'll never understand me or my needs.

and i have been on anxiety medication. on benzos at some point. and medication for ocd, that it was me who had to find out that i had it. because they had misdiagnosed me so much in the past. but honestly, i never felt any difference. because that would be periods between treatments where i would come off them for a few months and or between treatments. never felt a difference, it never got worse or better. it's almost like that wasn't the problem. because how could i ever be satisfied with a fake life. and when you are not living your truth, it's meant to be uncomfortable, otherwise i wouldn't leave. i would just live empty and apathetic because i here i am living this lie in a role imposed on me by others that has nothin to do with who i actually am, and not surrounded by anything that has any meaning to me or reflects me, my purpose, or truth in anyway. because my soul knows i deserve more.

they have treated my needs for safety, home, quality of life, and to be around my people as fanciful pipe dreams all my life. they would just tell me to get a life here and make friends here and have a job here, and maybe one day i could leave, when i can't let this be my life, or become this fake person. this isn't even the real world. everything about this place is completely backwards. being forced to live like them and speak their language, and not have access to any of the experiences, stimuli, or environments i needed. it's not like they didn't force me. and i had been living inside their ugly charade they built until i couldn't take it anymore. they were asking me to sacrifice my whole being. and i was doing that. not anymore. i like this quote that goes ""before you diagnose yourself with depression or low self-esteem, first make sure that you are not, in fact, just surrounded by assholes.""

since then i have felt very sad, it is difficult for me to do the things i like to distract myself, i wake up and the only thing i want is to anesthetize myself with marijuana



i started going to alcoholics anonymous, since before my hospitalization i had problems with alcohol



leaving the center, i felt happy. after many years, i managed to forgive those who had hurt me and above all i understood that i was hurting myself.



i started talking again to someone i cut contact with, everything was going well, he no longer responds to me, nor sees my messages, and it makes me feel lonely as shit



i want to cut ties, but it is very important to me, but at the same time it is exhausting to know that the other party is not on the same plane as you.



right now i feel empty, and more alone than ever, i really never thought i would fall into this abyss again after recovering my soul.



they took it from me from one moment to the next and i don't know what to do.

post_00023,"i can't take the depression anymore, i'm losing against my head hello everybody, first of all i want to apologize because english is not a first language, there are probably some errors in the writing and i hope they are not too annoying!

i'm from argentina and i'm 31 years old, i'm a music producer.

as i wrote in the title of the post, i can't stand my life anymore, the accumulation of things means that i can't enjoy anything, not even the things that i always loved. i grew up in a very psychologically hostile family environment and with abandonment.

my father was never present and my mother seems like she was my older sister, she always destroyed my self-esteem and attacked me for the profession i chose (i suffer from a lot of physical and psychological violence all my life, especially psychological), my only mother figure in my family was my grandmother who died 15 years ago.  

since i was 13 i have been thinking about suicide (i had suicide attempts as a teenager) i feel like i can't be happy, i feel invisible and that i am of no use, i'm in a very dark place right now.

the worst thing is that i did relatively well producing music, i was able to get into good record labels and have minimal recognition but i was always the shit of the family, the lazy one who didn't study law or medicine or any type of conventional careers.

i feel very alone and as i mentioned above i don't enjoy anything, the days are just days. 

i remember having conversations with people who i thought loved me and telling them about it because at one point i really felt like i had the strength to ask for help, but the people i mentioned my problem looked at me as if i were a strange and shitty being. i will never forget the reaction of one person in particular who told me how horrible you tried to do that, how disgusting.

from that moment on i can't ask for help and i honestly don't have the strength anymore. i feel like i'm definitely losing, i've been giving away my close belongings and talking to people i haven't talked to in a long time. 

for a few years now i have had the reflex to cut my arm and make cuts that would kill myself. i have written countless suicide letters, and i'm sure that the next time i write one it will be the last. 

i was always there for everyone and no one was there for me, and i understand it, the world does not revolve around me and i am only a small being in the entire universe. nobody has to worry about me.

in a way it makes me happy that my music may have made people happy, but my end is near.

i no longer have the strength for anything, i'm loosing against my head.



thank you for taking your time to read this and i sincerely hope that everything improves in your life for real. 



i wish you all the best.

post_00025,"anyone elses suicidal thoughts get triggered by the smallest things?. i dont even want to write out the small things that happen because they sound so stupid when i look back on them, but 9 times out of 10 they just result in me crying and wanting to die maybe im just weak and pathetic",1
post_00026,"i just overheard my mom talking on the phone when i came out to my mother as gay (13 years ago), she handled it very poorly. understandably so - she grew up baptist in a small alabama town in the 60s where there was not a lot of diversity. there were a lot of angry words between us, a lot of hurt, and it took a long time for us to repair our relationship. 

while she still doesn't like to talk a lot about homosexuality (and i'm not totally out to all of her friends to save us both the headache), she supports me wholeheartedly and treats my girlfriend like another daughter and it's wonderful. 

tonight i overheard her on the phone talking to a friend of hers and, while the conversation was (obviously) one-sided on my end, i could piece together the situation:

her friend found out that his child is gay and he is *not* happy about it. but after a few minutes, i heard my mom say, ""charlie, do you want your child to be miserable pretending to be straight or do you want her to be in a happy, loving relationship? no, we don't necessarily get the younger generations. things are a lot different now. but i would much rather my daughter be able to be happy and honest with herself than live a lie. [more conversation followed, but that was the best part].""

it really took me back. my mom is still really conservative around her conservative friends, and she doesn't really speak up that often about things like this. it made me really proud of her, her growth, and our relationship. 13 years ago i wasn't sure if i'd ever have a healthy relationship with my mother ever again, and tonight i heard her stand up for someone else's gay daughter. 

and while she couldn't be that woman 13 years ago, she was that woman tonight. and it's just so awesome. i love her so much.

—-

edit: wow, guys! i had no idea this would gain momentum like it has, but after reading some of your comments and some of your stories i understand why. 

i just wanted to say that some of us seem to be very lucky with our parents who surprised us, and i hate to see that some of you are still in the closet out of fear of your parents' response or had a terrible experience coming out. 

what helped me when i was 18 and my mom and i weren't on good terms was to build my own family for support. it helped that i'd moved away to college and had new friends in a new town; they really helped me while i was essentially estranged from my mom. 

and when i came out to my mom i expected the worst and that's what i got. at 31 now, i wouldn't have taken that response off of anyone and would definitely cut them out of my life. but my dad died when i was 13, and my mom and i really aren't close with the rest of our family. i think we both realized that we're really the only one each other can rely on. 

a few years ago, i was in a terribly abusive relationship with another woman and my mom and i still weren't on the best of terms. i had to move home to get away from that partner and spend a few months in therapy to fix the damage she caused. it was then mom told me that it didn't matter who i loved. it mattered that i was a good person and that i lived with the values that my dad had instilled in me. i think she saw how dark of a place i was in and she was afraid of losing me, and that helped her come to the realization that i was still her daughter and she wanted me to be happy, and that was more important than who i was attracted to. that was really the turning point in our relationship to get it back on track. 

all that to say, some of your parents may never change. and i'm really sorry for that and i hope you can build a new family. but some times parents really can surprise you, and you never know what the catalyst might be for them. 

i appreciate all of your comments and kind words towards my mother; i'm so glad some people can respect and value her growth where her conservative friends probably would not. she's still very conservative in some aspects, but since she's been able to accept me she's started coming around in a lot of other ways too. i probably won't mention this post to her because she's a very private person lol. but i know if she wasn't, she'd appreciate everything you all said.",1

as they left the store, he walked ahead while she followed, still staring at the ground. i wanted to approach her and ask if she was safe, but i hesitated. my kids were with me, she was too far away, and i didn't know how he might react. even after they left, i kept watching them as they went to their car, and i couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong. i even told my teenager, who noticed my concern, that i was worried about her.

my mom wants me to be independent, that's what she says, but it's not true, because in her behavior and the only deeply honest vulnerable things she said is ""i only have my daughter, she's all my life, what will i do without her ?"". i want to live my own life, i want to feel complete, but i can't because i fear my mom won't leave me alone.

besides, i feel like if i ever leave the house to go live or rent somewhere else like anybody else in our modern society, she'd go worse mentally and kill herself. she's also depressed and anxious af, so we're hurting each other with our paranoia and pent up anger and painful memories and anxiety and sadness. i had brothers and sisters who left home and went on their life, but they told me they had to get into a big fight and go through tears and pain before they slammed the door close behind them. now they have normal lives and get along very well with our mom, they still speak to each other irl and on the phone but i don't want to give her pain once again, she suffered so much in her life (bullying, domestic abuse, depression, social anxiety).

she's too scared for me, so i'm scared of life, and i don't want to be scared. i'm fed up with being a shrinking violet, and i know i'm usually not. i'm so angry with my mom but i want to save her at the same time. i feel like i'm going to kill her with one more bang to her pain threshold by going after the life my brothers and sisters had the privilege to get.

i can't help but feel a little resentful towards men sometimes. i love my job and i also have a side hustle too. both of these are on hold so i can take care of our baby. everything has changed for me - my body, my confidence, my finances, my freedom, my identity. i just feel like none of this happens to a man. sure, the good dads are hands on and i love that so much. but i feel like men just get to carry on with their lives as they did before, while we're slowly drowning in this new life. 

are these feelings normal? am i still depressed? is there anything i can do to help manage these emotions?",0

i had honestly forgotten about doing this because i've been really good about fapping and have an amazing partner, but i am currently moving and fell off a lot of my good mental health regimens and as a result have been excessively fapping again.  this has brought back a lot of these memories and has me feeling like i don't even deserve to be a part of society.  i am debating talking to my girlfriend about this stuff, but really know i should seek counseling once i am fully moved.  again i feel so disgusting and my porn/fapping/sex addiction runs deep so there are other things i am very ashamed about.  i've gotten through ocd thought loops before, and my girlfriend is a psychology major who is well aware i am in recovery and have a fucked up past (that she knows a lot about already) i just fear this is going to be too weird and insane.  appreciate anyone who took the time to read all that, honestly feels good to just get it out if anything.",1

after 3 days of not speaking, i gave him a long speech how betrayed and disgusted i was, and how he should quit porn. he blamed it on being high. we started talking again, everything resumed like nothing happened.

and mostly my life hasn't changed, except now i have violent horrifying nightmares of him trying to rape me. i feel like my whole body is frozen as i try to wake myself up.
i genuinely don't know what to do. sometimes i'm disgusted by myself for still talking with him and acting like nothing happened. i haven't told a single soul about any of this. i don't know if i should tell a friend or get a therapist. i don't feel like i'm under danger or that he will attempt anything like this again, but those nightmares terrify me so much and make me feel so helpless.

edit: this situation happened back in april, and he didn't attempt anything since, that's why i don't think he'll do this again. he's also planning to move away soon, so i don't think we'll see each other often.

some people also mentioned it probably wasn't weed but some other drug, and looking back they are probably right. i've seen him high many times before and after this incident, but that day he went to the bathroom and when he returned his behavior was very unusual.

reporting him to police realistically won't have any legal consequences for him. telling to my parents is way too scary for many reasons, and it seems too much to unload on a friend either. i will however try to gather enough courage to go to a therapist and start locking my bedroom door at night. thank you for your advice and kind words.",1

post_00087,"i literally feel nothing i'd like to start this by saying i should be happy. literally nothing fundamentally wrong with my life. i'm an 18m with a pretty decent family that's not rich but also doesn't have financial problems. my parents have never been the kind that becomes friends with their children; they're present but distant, and i like to think this doesn't bother me.

ok house, ok family, decent love live past (although i'm currently single), good friends, and yet i would really like to be dead right now. i have motivation for nothing. i currently go to my 6h a day attendant job every day, and spend the rest of the day in bed doing nothing meaningful.

the fact that i'm not moving forward doesn't really bother me. pretty much nothing does. i don't feel sadness, nor happines, nor excitement, nor anything. i'm just quietly existing like a plastic bag drifting through the wind, yet i really don't feel like a firework lol. i'm not really picking a path; i feel like i just let everyone else decide what they want me to be, and i'll just become that.

being this meaningless used to cause me great pain and put me way closer to pulling the trigger, but 100mg of venlafaxine and 50mg of trazodone turned pain into abstence of literally everything. i really don't care whether i wake up tomorrow. in fact, if someone tried to rob me, i'd much much rather have them kill me than take my phone, since dying is better than the pain of having to live wihout a phone.

i'm kinda just picking whatever path causes me less pain, without any goal or objective. i feel like i'd like to have a good job in an area i actually like, but i don't really care enough to go through the pain of actually putting effort into it. just drifting through the wind.

and having my parents pay for my really fucking expensive depression treatment (psychiatrist, psychologist, drugs) without me getting any better just makes me feel like a massive useless burden they have to carry. i know if i die it'll be worse for them, especially if it is by my own hand, and that's pretty much one of the only things keeping me here, but i can't help but feel like my existence brings more harm than good. that's why i try to be as useful as possible to everyone around me, turning into exactly what they need me to be. i'm absolutely terrified of being a burden, yet i feel like i am just that for 60 minutes every hour.

i don't know if there's any cohesion to this block of text, and i don't think anyone's going to actually read this far, but dear reader, i know your immediate instinct is telling me to get help, but what do i do if i already have really supportive friends, and am already taking antidepressants and getting professional help?

how do you keep hope when it feels like the last 8 months of ""getting help"" worked exclusively to keep me from killing myself, so no one else has to feel bad for me while i still feel like shit?",1

hi guys, as you can tell from the title i have a fear of death but its more than just that. its extremely taking over me and idk what to do. i am 18 years old and i am on sertaline a few days i go i tapered down from 50mg to 25mg every 3 days. during that i found out about the death an actor in one my all time favourite shows (b99) , i did not think about it much like i usually do when i hear about death but slowly it creeped up and i started having so many thoughts about death, about how life is temporary, and how one day my parents wont be here and that we all die at some point. its deppressing me and i cant stop thinking about it i even cried about i cant handle it. i have never thought about death like this, i dont know if its directly because of sertaline but even if it is i keep telling my self it is just side effects but at the same time the thought and concept itself is still real… i cant handle it.

whats worse is its driving me so insane that im researching about longevity and immortality, and how in longevity articles they say ai will bring groundbreaking discoveries but every time the feeling in the back of my head is telling me im coping and that there is nothing i can do to prevent it . 

all i can keep thinking about is death, i keep imaging people i see on the street 100 years laters we will all die at some point and its making me go crazy, i have never thought about death like this, whenever it was brought up or when i even thought about it. like i play gta, i watch shows and movies and characters die not a big deal it was never insensitive to me. its so insane i dont know what to do, does this go away?",1

for example, you can search things like ""rain city background"" or ""medieval town ambiance"" or ""crackling fireplace and rain background"", a lot of youtubers have uploaded thousands of videos that you can just leave playing in the background.  last night i slept to an international space station ambient video.

post_00115,"i tried to kill myself but survived and no one knows january  8th 2020 i was driving home listening to amy winehouse and decided that this was my time. it was on a windy, empty country road, late at night, in torrential rain- accidents happened there all the time. i had just finished having dinner with my housemate at university and was on my way to my hometown to see my family. no one would suspect a thing. i closed my eyes, let go of the steering wheel and put my foot down. 

when i opened my eyes my vision was blurred, but i could see that my windshield had caved in. i proceeded to crawl out across the passenger seat, opening the door with my elbow as hands were covered in shards of glass. there was no shock, no confusion. i felt a small sense of relief that i wasn't paralysed, and a bigger sense of relief that i hadn't hit anyone else. but other than that, i still felt just as dead inside as i had prior to the crash.

i went through the motions. strangers came to my aid, followed shortly by the paramedics and later my parents. i laughed and smiled through it, cracking jokes about ordering my preferred cocktail of pain relief and apologising for keeping everyone up so late. i had just survived a near fatal car crash and already the guilt and shame of everyone worrying about me was kicking in.

i had aquaplaned across the road, accelerating into a hedge, before flipping my 2004 corsa four times, knocking down a row of silver birches in the process and spinning 20m down the country lane. i had landed upright but the roof of the car had moulded around my headrest. i'm only 5'2"", if i was a couple of inches taller my head would have been caved in. i should have been dead. 

instead, i spent a week in hospital lying on my back, completely immobilised, awaiting my c7 spinal surgery. post-surgery, my doctor told me he'd seen mri scans like mine where the patient had already been paralysed, so i guess the fact that i walked out of hospital after 9 days with just a neck brace was a silver lining. 

since then i've carried on keeping up appearances. things have changed, some for the better, some for the worse. for a while, my frustration that i had survived was outweighed by my relief that i wasn't paralysed, and in truth that is still the case. but my fear of putting my family through something like that again is starting to wear off. it's a constant fight between my happiness and their grief. what's more important? should i continue to suffer silently in a world where i feel completely lost and alone, just to postpone their mourning for what will eventually happen anyway?",1

post_00124,"i want to die but i really don't want to. i just want these thoughts to stop.  but they've been happening for 15+ years.  i am so tired of the same bullshit. over and over again. i have bpd so my life is a fucking mess and always will be, till the day i finally stop breathing. god i hope that day is soon. and i hope it's not by my own hand. 

when i'm happy, i feel so hopeful and like i'm on top of the world. i can't even understand why i'm depressed, or why i get like this. it's like i think i'm lying almost. like i gaslight myself into thinking that it's over and i will finally be at peace. but peace never comes. no matter how much ""progresss"" i make, it never comes. 

feeling that happy may sound nice and i can't lie, in the moment it feels incredible. i literally feel unstoppable. but the crash is hard. you know the feeling when you set a goal for yourself only to not reach it? you feel bummed out right? well, i feel emotions very strongly. so when that crash happens, i hate myself. i feel like a failure. and this happens every 2 weeks. almost like fucking clockwork, can you believe it?

when i'm sad, like now, all i want to do is die. the only answer is to crawl inside a hole, and die. i feel like i have 1000 pounds strapped to my ankles and someone is telling me to run for my life. i'm so discouraged and tired. so fucking tired

i write a lot in my journal and on my google docs when i get like this. the line i've written the most is ""i'm so tired."" i only started writing in 2018 when i was 20 years old. 

i wish i could just give someone else this opportunity to live because i dont deserve it. i can't get myself to love it. 

i have a husband and a daughter and when i'm happy, i can't ever picture myself leaving. i can't even understand why on earth i have these thoughts, it's like i'm a different person who's trying to understand someone else's insane mental illness. only i can't understand it and i judge it. 

but now that i'm sad, i feel horrible for making them go through these mood swings. 

i'm a product of shitty parents and brothers who didn't love me and made me feel like i was a wasted space. all of them. literally each of them. sometimes, the parent being around isn't the best option. and that's exactly how i feel about me and my daughter. i feel like i am going to fail her, that i already have. when i get mad, i get so fucking angry. i see red, i scream, i don't care for anyone's feelings. shes fucking 5 years old and shes seen my anger. i've yelled at her before. several times. i am going to ruin her life the way my mom ruined mine. 

the worst part? i can't control my anger. i have been this way since i was in middle school. 

the solution? i'm dead. i'm not alive to get angry. it's also the solution to my mood swings is it not? if i'm dead, i'm not feeling emotions. i'm not thinking of the past. i'm not thinking of when my brother sexually abused me for 5 years of my life. i'm not thinking of the times my dad would scream at me and tell me i was weak because i felt sad all the time. i'm not thinking of the fact that my mom knows what my brother has done yet she still tells me she loves him. i'm not thinking of how my other brother told me i was stupid every single day of my pathetic life to the point that as a 26 year old, i still hear him say it and i still feel so fucking dumb. 

i just want this to stop. i want all of it to stop. i don't even want to die. i really truly don't. i want to watch my daughter graduate. i want to be there for her. i want to spend more time with my wonderful husband. but they don't deserve this. ",1

she walked with me to the er (which meant a lot even if she was just doing her job). i was only there for about 4 hours. i may have downplayed the severity of my ideation out of fear of being admitted. the psychiatrist determined that i did not need to be forced to be hospitalized but could choose to if i felt it was needed. i said no, though now i'm wondering if i should've said yes. i was discharged with mental health resources.

one part of my mind is gently telling me that i did the right thing, that i can use those resources to get better, but the other part is so loud. it is screaming that i fucked up, that it's pointless and i will end up killing myself anyway because i didn't tell the whole truth, that i don't deserve help.

i just want my pain to be over but every single way to die is way too painful. i've felt like my life is over since two years ago when i first attempted. 

i dont even wanna go to a hospital, i feel like i can't take it anymore. i just wanted a normal life, but i've been denied that too, since my mom is being accused of occupying our apartment illegally (which we are renting and paying) and now we might end up on the streets, i can't study cause my school didn't send me the paperwork i need to be homeschooled, i can't work cause no company wants a 17 year-old, i can't go to therapy cause the public health system is horrible, i can't exercise because i'm too scared to go outside, and all of my friends are in university, so we barely hang out.

i just want a reason to stay",1
post_00141,"anyone else just staying alive for other people at this point?. i shouldnt be so miserable. i have a roof over my head and a family that loves me. i have money and can afford luxuries. i go to therapy and take medicine. i have three pets (one a puppy we recently adopted). 

but i just want to die. im so lonely, constantly. my heart is so broken and im so exhausted i just want to give up and finally kill myself. but i dont want to hurt my family. i dont want to think about my dogs waiting for me to come back and not knowing where ive gone. i dont want my mum and dad to blame themselves for it. 

there are some people whod be glad to see me go. my older sister & youngest sister, most likely. my former friends. idk. 

all i do is disappoint others, i lose them. i cant do anything. im so useless i cant even kill myself. haha. im tired.",1
post_00142,"just bought a shotgun; should i also get a cheap car and go travel before i die? i just bought a shotgun, will be picking it up from bass pro in few days.

  
i was glancing through this subreddit and saw the suggestion to go live a little before one dies.

  
my initial plan was to get the gun and blow my head off in the dorm, or maybe outside to mitigate mess. now, after hearing the idea of spending a little and seeing the world before death, i feel like it kinda jives with me.

a lot of my depression deals with feelings of entrapment: i feel trapped in this body, i feel trapped in my own expectations, i'm terrified of being trapped in a ward again. it most likely relates to the child abuse i faced from my parents (who still run free to this day, despite one of them being taken to court) and the anger subsequent from such an experience.

hell, with a car and numbered days i could go visit the sodden fucks and give them a piece of my mind, i could yell and shout and finally do what i should've done as a kid: stand up for myself. i would never hurt them, not unless they tried to hurt me.

i don't want to kill others along with me, even if they're abusive fuckwads.

  
facebook marketplace has cars for $2000, i could probably secure a car in a week or so. the gun will be ready by then. i would need to make sure nobody has my location through my phone, and i would need to ignore any calls or messages from my few friends or family.

  
what are y'all's thoughts? should i run and then gun? be free for once?

  
thank you",1
post_00143,i want to have a failed attempt and be hospitalised i know it sounds crazy but l've been wanting to commit suicide for a while now. while i really want to do it i just can't leave my family here and make them suffer yet. so i was thinking about having a failed attempt so l would be taken to the hospital and people would realise l'm not well at all. i feel so tempted to do it like overdose on pills to the point where i can still call an ambulance and not die. i also want to try what it feels like to almost die before i actually do it. it makes me feel like l'm a horrible attention seeker but l'm just too exhausted to care about anything anymore. i don't know what to do.,1
post_00144,"i like bigger women, but i kinda feel bad about it for context, i don't nessicarily feel bad because i want to hide something or think they're unattractive. i mostly just feel bad because thinking about it (at least in a form of attraction) just makes feel like a creep, and after spending a lot of time reading/hearing about how not too many of them even like themselves body wise, it just makes me feel worse about the attraction as a whole.

post_00145,ive only taken 1 shower/bath in the past 3 years. im not really living. im hanging on by a thread. the heading is true and i havent washed my hair in longer. im disgusting and i hate myself so much. my hair is a matted mess and i want to shave my head so bad but ive shaved my head before to get rid of lice and i looked terrible for a year while it grew back. i just want to die so i dont have to deal with it. these feeling always pass after a few weeks but idk if i can survive this time. it sucks too because nothing is going wrong and its my dogs 4th birthday in a week and a half and we got a house after living in the worst apartment ever for years. i just dont know what to do. i stopped going to school in 8th grade so i have no future. im trying to get ssi (disability for ppl who havent worked basically) but i know they wont accept me because mental health isnt taken seriously so i dont have any money. im sorry this is probably all over the place im just typing. i just want to die. i feel it would help my family so much because i eat so much food. ugh idk why im doing this i guess im trying to keep myself occupied so i dont do anything. bye i guess,1

i understand the concept of this saying/phrase, but for me/people who are never comfortable, it disregards how we feel on a day to day basis: anxious. uncomfortable. never able to chill out or calm down because we are driven by anxiety.

post_00150,"i survived and i can be happy. a month ago i cut my wrist and tried to end my life. it didn't work. these past few weeks i've been feeling better and sometimes i even feel hopeful

a while ago i met someone i had been working with. i had thought we became friends. i really valued this friendship. i felt they were leading me on and gave them a few weeks to stop. they didn't so i decided to talk to them privately not thinking it was that big of a deal. they lied to me about it. it wasn't a big deal but lying made it so much worse. honesty is a big thing for me. so i stopped talking to them for a couple days but got over it. we had another talk about the subject and after they hated me and i don't know why

i was sad at first because i thought we were friends and it hurt me. eventually i decided i no longer wanted to speak to this person because they were treating me horribly. they started being hostile towards me, spreading lies about me and doing everything they can to hurt me. this really did hurt me. i thought this person was my friend and they started acting this way towards me out of no where and i didn't understand and it made me think there was something wrong with me

this situation brought my mental health to a very bad point. this person was aware i struggled with mental health and continued acting this way towards me. i honestly believe they really wanted to hurt me as much as they could. i started hurting myself again for the first time in years, the whole situation made me really sad.

i tried ignoring it, i tried doing things like an employee of the month in order to repair the issue but nothing worked and this person wouldn't stop. they started getting their friends to act hostile towards me as well and i continued trying to be helpful and nice even though i was hurting so much inside. eventually i had to make a complaint hoping this would finally make them stop

they stopped for a month but eventually continued. i hated making that complaint but didn't know what else to do. i've never worked somewhere like this before with people like that before. eventually i had to quit my job knowing i didn't have the money to support myself. after i was hurt and bothered by the situation but every day it was going away, it would just take time.
 
i tried to stand up for myself. they spread lies about me saying i'm dangerous. i would never hurt someone. any of my friends, coworkers would never think of me that way. she said this knowing it wasn't true. i've ran into multiple people working there since then and none of them were scared of me. these lies destroyed me. kindness is the most important thing to me, i care so much about helping others and being kind and this person lied and said i was dangerous and it broke me.

i begged them not to do it, i told them it would destroy me and my life but they did it anyways. afterwards i fell into a spiral and started hurting myself more and more. the pain was so much. everything i had worked for had been taken away, it hurt so much. i thought about killing myself everyday but it was terrifying. eventually i cut my wrist but it didn't work. i've done it multiple times since then. i've cried to please be able to wake up from this nightmare, all i've wanted is to be happy again. i made videos hurting myself, im embarrassed but i understand that the depression overwhelmed me and the pain was too much. most people don't understand how much depression can hurt

ive been doing better these past few weeks. i've been lucky to now be surrounded by good people. spirit, scooters and now justlove. these people here are good people and they really really like me. everyone there really likes me and thinks im a good person and tells me thing like ""bryson it is such a pleasure working with you"", ""normally i get anxiety around people but for someone reason i feel comfortable around you"", ""sorry if i seem mean, i feel really comfortable around you and act mean to people i like"", they really like me and all these things they say make me so happy

i worked there at that place for so long surrounded by those horrible people that they convinced me that there was something wrong with me and i believed it. now that i've been surrounded by good people and all these places and now that i can stop and remind myself that ive been surrounded by good people in the past too, now i know that i was unlucky. i was unlucky to work at a place like that. i could have worked any where else and i'd still be happy now, i know that

most people are good. most people like me and think i'm good. i know im a good person. those people were horrible. they were the mean, inconsiderate, self centered, and most horrible people i have ever met. all of them. i've worked places where you have a bad apple but somehow all the most horrible people in this town gathered in that one place and they were so horrible to be around. they only cared about themselves and they couldn't see how horrible they were so they treated me like i was crazy and made me believe it but i stood out there because im good surrounded by evil. i don't stand out at scooters or just love because the people there are good

i don't understand how people can be so evil, so mean. i wish i would've worked anywhere else. i wish i never met those people. i'm happy that im no longer surrounded by them and i have good people around me who help me, care about me, are kind to me and who are good. that girl, i tried to be her friend and i was hurt that she acted that way, her continuing to act that way really really hurt me and her acting that way for months was too much, and then even after she continued and it destroyed me and i spiraled and hurt myself again and again and the pain the pain was so much i couldn't handle it

but i survived. and sometimes i feel hopeful. and i'm starting to think i can be happy again. the people around me really like me and that makes me so happy and they're kind. i've realized how big of an impact the people i surround myself with can have on me. those people gas lighted me and convinced me there was something wrong with me but i know now that's not true. i know now they were bad people. they were mean and cruel and the most horrible people i have ever met in my entire life and they grouped up and it was too much. but now i'm free from that

i survived and i think i can be happy again. i think i can be happy like before. i hope i never see any of those people again. i hope one day they understand just how much they hurt me and i hope they never treat anyone else this way again. i wish this never happened to me. this pain, this experience, it broke me. i barely survived. i've lost so much these past 6 months because of their lies and hate. i'll never understand that hate. i could've never hated them the same way. i don't understand it. but i don't have to. but i wish i worked anywhere else because i moved here to do something with my life, to be happy, and i was happy so happy coming to columbia but i was unfortunate to be surrounded by those people, they ruined this new experience for me and almost broke me with their hate but i survived and i think i can be happy again

i barely survived, their hate hurt me, really hurt me. but i think i can be happy again. i feel free from all of this, from them, and i think i can be happy again. i hope i don't ever feel this way again and i don't ever hurt myself again",1
post_00151,"worst part is they won. as i reflect on my shitty life i think one of the worst parts about this is that all those who wronged me and mentally and physically abused me won. they went to college and had fun. they went to college and made memories. they went to college and met lovers and eventually married. certainly i'm not claiming that they and they alone are responsible for how my life ended, but certainly things would have been different had i not been tormented in middle school and high school.

post_00156,"i don't know why i'm still alive. i have no idea why i am still alive and why i still have contact to people. everything hurts and i've completely given up on almost everything.

depression has been a part of my life since the age of seven, i can't imagine life without depression and suicide thoughts because that's all i ever think about, no matter what. yes, of course i have times where i feel wonderful and where my life is going somewhat decent but life is completely fucking with me. even though i have amazing friends and a wonderful boyfriend that keep up with my shit. 

my best friend, ""m"", has never met a me without depression. when i moved away from the place i grew up (which really effected my mental health because i had to leave the people i grew up with) she was the first person i talked with. the first friend i made, the first day of second grade, she was there. she smiled at me and we walked home together. ever since that moment i knew she was a keeper. and she is, she's seen me in the worst possible states but also in some great ones, and i appreciate her and her presence. she is a great person, just like her boyfriend. ""l"" is my male best friend, and i brought him together with ""m"". they are like siblings. siblings that listen to you and want you to feel alright. 

but now, to the people that made me depressed. my family. my father is pure hell but i love him, even though he is a shit father. i try to keep up with him and to spend time with him because he has cancer and diabetes. but i haven't talked to him in a while, even though we literally live in the same house. everytime we talk it's just yelling because ""i'm the reason why he's dying"" and ""everything is my fault"" and because ""i'm ruining this family"" everytime he says shit like that, i believe him. i am a shit kid because he is a shit dad, but i can't control myself. i'm the black sheep. the one with the dyscalculia, i'm the one with depression, i'm the one with bpd. i'm just the mentally ill one out of the other 3 perfect kids my father has. i am the outcast, i've always been. 

my mama.. i don't know what to say about her. she met my dad at a very young age (she was 15 and he was 32) and they've been together ever since. she is.. complicated. i can talk with her but i can't. she's very irrated after work and she works almost everyday so i get yelled at and shit at when the house isn't clean or something. but mama listens to my cries because she sees that i'm struggling mentally, but she's never sent me to a therapist because she tried to ""fix"" me herself. (she's a psychologist.) she is a total sweetheart and an amazing mother, but when she's pissed, she drops very hurtful things. she always says i'm like my dad. last time she said that i broke down crying, saying ""i don't want to be like him"" and she just said ""then don't be."" which didn't make it any better.. :/ but, me and her had many deep and sad talks. i once asked her ""why didn't you leave?"" and she was like ""because he wasn't like this back then and now i can't leave because.. what kind of shit move is it to leave the guy that cared for you so many years, right as his health starts to get worse?"" i just looked down and nodded, saying that i get what she is saying, because i do get it. 

to my siblings.. they are complicated. they treat me like dirt but they love me. one of my little sisters, ""i"", always tells everyone irl that she loves me and that i'm her favorite sister but at home she puts me down. probably because she sees that dad gives her praise, but oh well, what do i know? and yeah, the youngest, ""c"", just purely and truly hates me but also loves me sometimes. everytime she does some shit, she puts the fault on me and they believe her which pmo so bad sometimes. but do i put up a fight? hell no. and well, my older brother, ""a"" is.. scary. when we were little we were best friends and hung out together. but now he hates me. i don't even think he remembers the shit he's done to me. i remember so vividly the one time he tried to f*ck me. yes, f*ck me. he was like.. 13? and i was 10. he wanted to stick it in till he heard our parents car pull into the driveway. i thank god that nothing happened that day. i don't hate my brother, i just find him weird. he hates me but he doesn't? i don't know. i feel uncomfortable around him most of the time. but.. yeah.

and now to.. my baby, my everything, ""k"". kevin has been my boyfriend for two months now and he's heard about the shit i'm going through. he wants me to go to the police the whole time because my dad sometimes still tends to be abusive but my heart can't handle sending a cancer sick diabetic old man in jail for treating me like shit for years. he's a huge prick but he's my father and somewhere i still love him even though i want him dead sometimes. but, ""k"" has been there for me in every single situation, trying to make me feel better and to cheer me up, he's the best boyfriend a girl could ask for, like.. seriously.

this is a long ass fucking vent and i'm so sorry to anyone who's reading this but i just can't anymore. 

i want to stay alive but these thoughts and voices are getting louder everyday. i have a lot of reasons to live, ""m"", ""l"", my mom, my boyfriend, ""k"". but i feel like they are getting tired of me. it's the same shit everyday. i'm happy, i lose energy and ignore them because i'm crying or slitting my fucking wrist like a fucking selfish bastard. i promised mama so many times that i'm going to stop but i can't. i seriously cut to feel something else than this crippling sadness. the sudden bursts of energy and happiness make me insane, i don't want to he happy for few minutes/hours, i want to be happy for a few days, weeks, maybe even months! but i guess that's too much to ask. 

i'm sorry for venting. i'm sorry if this is tmi. but i don't want to keep on living, not even for my favorite people, i'm just fucking tired. sorry.

post_00157,"i see no path forward for me. i (29m) am going to use this as a word vomit. potentially practice for a suicide note.

i cannot fathom my life improving. in fact, for the past 5 years, it has gotten progressively worse. and now it's just unbearable. i have nothing. i worked for 7 years in college and postgrad to escape trauma from every type of abuse from both parents. but doing so led to racking up unbelievable student loan debt, and now i can't even make ends meet. although sober now, years of alcoholism and addiction to weed led me to episodes of induced psychosis/mania that, in turn, caused me to cut off or lose all family, lose positive direction in my career, and almost all friends, besides my best friend and his wife. and i feel like such a burden to them. like a 3rd wheel, being invited to things only because of how pitifully lonely my life is. but i did this to myself, i shouldn't be their burden to bear. my physical health has deteriorated. i grew up without sports and am unfit, which led me to needing spinal surgery during covid, causing a constant fear that it is too late to begin a fitness journey. i have a dog whom i love dearly, but my lack of finances and depression have led to him having skin conditions that i am having serious issues resolving on my own. i feel like such a failure for not giving him all of the care he needs.

i feel like a lost cause. i feel like, at 29 with no family and one real friend, that it is impossible to recover from the hole i dug myself in. i am tired of being a burden to my friend, my dog. my dog would be much better off in the care of someone with better finances and mental health. my friend shouldn't feel the responsibility of making me happy simply because i can't do it myself.

i see a psychiatrist, but i feel as if he overmedicated me to a point of this suicide ideation, leading me to voluntarily spend christmas & new years in a psych ward, although i would've spent it alone otherwise. i am starting emdr therapy, but spending $80 per session without having started the actual emdr so far is like a costly tease.

the state of the us has not helped my thought processes. as i work in supplemental food assistance programs, i fear my job security is in jeopardy. and i fear for my clients, who many are immigrants. vitriol, hate, and disinformation won, and i genuinely fear that we will not have another election again. nazi salutes from oligarchs in government further this fear.

i dont have access to firearms. i'm aware that overdosing is risky and can leave me worse off than i am now. i've constantly thought of driving fast off of a highway into the tree line, but the risks of living and mangling myself stop me.

i bought rope last weekend. 362 pound load bearing rope. i have nowhere to hang myself for a full suspension hanging, but a partial hanging is doable in my closet. i've practiced and can hit my carotid artery just right. the only thing stopping me is that my dog is here, and i don't want him to see my lifeless body.

post_00159,"the emergency room treats people with mental health issues like shit. i was admitted last night to the er for a suicide attempt. i was very upset and had multiple panick attacks.

i know i needed help. yet the doctor send me away. in the next hour i was rushed in by ambulance for a more serious attempt. which could have been avoided if the doctor actually would have listend to me. 

the attempt caused me to have surgery. note, i'm extremely anxious about anesthesia etc. so i tried to walk away, the nurses forced me back in bed. after a couple of minutes i tried to walk away again, this time they put me into seclusion. i told them i didn't want to take off my pants because of a recent rape, they proceeded to push me to the ground and forced them of me. this made me have a severe panick attack. i was left alone.

after a while i got out of seclusion, still visibly upset. they wanted to put the saturation thiny on my finger but i didn't give it straight away because i was wiping my tears. i got dragged to seclusion because of this. 

this morning i got the surgery, i tried to comply as much as possible. the surgery went well and i got into a recovery room. the doctor came and told me i was free to go. i told him i will try to kill myself again. he said that thats a risk he's willing to take. 

right now i'm sitting on my bathroom floor in tears not knowing what i should do next.

post_00168,"i think i have a fear of extinction im going to preface this by stating that i have insomnia that is brought on by major depression mixed with anxiety. a few years back i tried to remedy it by taking some thc gummies before bed, and at first they seemed to help. i would get high as a kite and i would drift off peacefully to sleep without any resistance. one night, instead of drifting off to sleep, my mind started to wander. at first it seemed more philosophical than anything, like ""how massive the universe is"" or ""we can't be alone out here"", pretty mundane stuff. but then my thoughts got dark, the thought of how every emotion i have felt, every tear i've ever shed, every experience i've ever had, family ties, everything that would pertain to me as in individual in this life is going to disappear when i die. 
i understand and acknowledge death as a natural part of the cycle, and the fact that i will be remembered helps some, but the notion that my consciousness, my entire persona, has an expiration date bothers me.

have you looked at the news lately? everything is falling apart around us, the planet is on fire, people are being rounded up, privacy is non-existent and we're told repeatedly that we have no value unless we've been commoditized. buy this, buy that, you need this random, useless tatt but we don't! we don't *need* any of it but it's still rammed down our throats day in, day out, bombarding us from every fucking direction and i'm just exhausted. 

i can't do this for another 40 years, i'm done, i'm checking out and i don't mean from the hotel. i'm going to have a large gin and tonic while i run a bath. it might relax me amd there's a niggling voice at the back of mind screaming ""please don't do this"" but i don't want to listen anymore. 

mum, if by chance you happen to read this, please know that i love you and i'm truly, truly sorry for putting you through this. for what it's worth i'm so glad that you enjoyed silverstone. i love you. i love you i fucking love you and im sorry

edit: i'm still here. this has been the most difficult 24 hours of my life but i'm still here. i took the train back today and told my mum i needed to speak to her urgently, as soon as i saw her i told her i loved her, i told her why i went to a hotel and then i broke down in tears like an absolute mess. she told me she couldn't stand the thought of burying one of her sons, we hugged and i cried on her for about 20 minutes. i'm back at home now and reading most of the responses here has been overwhelming. i still don't think i can go on, but i think i'm going to at least try, until it becomes unbearable again anyway.",1

post_00172,"debating hanging myself after years of will they or won't they on suicide; no quality of life for the foreseeable future it just deleted all my work so i'm not retyping out why i'm debating hanging myself. i spent like an hour on that.

tl;dr severely mentally ill + autistic + chronic pain to the point that no matter how i position myself something is always hurting as long as i'm conscious + hoarding situation i've lived in for at least 7 years that gave me dust mite allergies so i also have chronic allergies/nonallergic rhinitis + long covid survivor + concussion survivor + >!csa from family members from young age that's been as recent as a new year's party!< (mention of csa) + dad is retired but is doing the bare minimum to take care of me which includes starving me every other day (and i've lost like 15 pounds as a result) + mom used to take decent care of me but her mom/my grandma is developing dementia and almost killed herself by leaving the gas stove on twice (pet cat saved her) so now she's her paid home aid attendant and is only home from 7 pm to maybe 6 am? (can't stay with her because between her chain smoking in the bedroom i stay in at that house all day, my grandma coughing all night, and homeless people scrounging through the garbage at 3 am i cannot sleep well there and will quickly get very irritable and aggressive) + 2 year long substance and mental illness fueled situationship with an avoidant who doesn't seem to want to broach things unless i broach them first (and i am not in the right headspace to do that) as conversations become increasingly agonizingly awkward and stilted (plus i think we're both starting to build resentment what with how long it's been so chances are it'll still end badly) + diet that mostly consists of carbs, chocolate, milk, fast food, and junk food hence pretty bad constipation + organization doing my psych shit keeps giving me the runaround so i gave up on it until my mom can help me with it + no job history and no real skills other than writing so i'm essentially a neet and no entry-level jobs seem to want to take a chance on people like me (or all the jobs offering training and stuff are in sales meaning getting fired speedrun any% because i have the type of autism people can sense that gives them an ick) + haven't gone to college yet (likely never will) since i never figured out what i was going to major in and i don't have the mental or physical willpower for it + anhedonia worsened to the point that not even retail therapy is helping, not to mention literally anything that previously gave me even an atom of serotonin + isolated from friends because nobody who knows how i'm doing wants to spend time with me/friends who care are busy with college + therapist is all over the place so one week she's giving me homework she never follows up with me on and the next she just lets me rant for the entire appointment (which helps but at the end of the day is like throwing a piece of angel hair pasta at the niagara falls and claiming you built a dam) + two pet deaths in december (aunt's oldest cat and my pet spider) + generally feeling weighed down by deaths over the past 3 years (uncle died of cancer; other uncle/his brother died of od; online best friend killed herself via benadryl od).

there's probably more but that's all i could get off the top of my head in 20 minutes. if i hang myself, it either has to be after my mom's left for her commute but before my dad's woken up or after my dad's done his first checkup of the day on me but before my mom comes home. i have belts and towels. online sources say that i could pass out as quickly as under 20 seconds and die within 10 minutes if i do it right, so that doesn't sound half bad for something with a 70% mortality rate. considered oding in the past but never got enough pills to do so and i started getting this guy who survived several ods and is now dying of kidney failure regardless in my youtube recommended so i figured ""let me not end up like that"". could also lie on train tracks but that involves traumatizing a train conductor and as an autistic person to bring harm to trains in any way goes against my morals.

to retort against any common reasons for why i shouldn't do it/suggestions: can't own a pet between the hoarding situation, no consistent money for food, and mom hating rodents + dad being allergic to cats; ""look at the sunrise and enjoy how beautiful it is 🥺"" bullshit never worked for me and definitely won't now that i have very severe anhedonia; i already self-medicate and don't have the time management, caregiver, or memory required for taking psychiatric meds i don't give enough of a fuck about anyone i know to not do it solely for them; i have no reason to believe my life will improve in any way for the foreseeable future since even if my grandma died and my mom returned home she's now out of a job so we're back to having issues with money and me being pressured to look at jobs that don't want me and my parents are going to die sooner or later so...seems like my death would just be postponed by maybe 25 years max. 25 more years of being in pain every day. i really don't want to go through that. i already have basically no quality of life as is.

if i'm lucky, i die of a stress induced heart attack in my sleep mid-dream and don't wake up...or i wake up and feel like i've never been depressed before in the morning and ride that high until i can't anymore to try and get myself as far away from this internal bottomless pit of suicidality as possible.",1

post_00175,"feeling overwhelmed and hopeless i don't know how much longer i can go on like this. every day feels like a battle that i am losing more and more. the darkness inside me is suffocating, and the weight on my shoulders is becoming unbearable. i feel like i'm drowning in a sea of despair with no lifeline in sight.  my relationships are crumbling, and i feel like a burden to everyone around me. the constant struggle to keep up appearances and pretend that i'm okay is draining me of whatever little energy i have left. the thought of reaching out for help seems daunting, as i fear judgment and rejection.  i've tried therapy and medications, but nothing seems to ease the pain that consumes me from the inside out. the loneliness is deafening, and the future looks bleak and desolate. i keep asking myself if this is all there is to life, and if it's worth enduring this agony day in and day out.  the idea of ending it all creeps into my mind more often than i'd like to admit. the thought of escaping this torment feels like the only way out. it's hard to see any light at the end of the tunnel when all i feel is darkness surrounding me.  i know there are people out there who are suffering just like me, and it breaks my heart to know that so many of us are fighting silent battles. if you're reading this and feeling the same way, please know that you're",1
post_00176,"after you read this, ill be dead. take that however you want to  i dont want anyone to discourage me from suicide. i want to die, no matter how painful the process is. 
to be honest, this is more of a suicide note. i never really intended on writing one in the first place--but life is like a fucking book, so it needs a good resolution. this post might as well be the conclusion paragraph to my life. 

people are probably going to look at my post history and go like ""oh but you're 16, you have so much ahead of you, and you're probably just going through a phase"" 
i would've had a fucking future waiting for my with open arms, if i was a fucking neurotypical boomer. im not going to have a great future if people like me (autistic) are considered to be intellectually disabled and cant hold a fucking job. im especially not going to enjoy life as an adult with how shitty society is turning into. not in a society where the economoy is so fucked up, that the price of a coco cola can is cheaper than water. 

dont get me wrong, every generation had its struggles and obstacles. 

thats the problem. i do not wish to exist in a reality, where suffering is prevalent. so prevalent and severe, to the point where people would wish for death. 

of course, happiness can't exist without suffering. one cant exist without the other.. honestly, if i were to state my own philosophical interpretations on that fact, id say that happiness might as well be represented as an antagonist. we want that feeling of euphoria so we can run away from the negative aspects of life. without that euphoria, we are in a state of suffering, because we are aware of that pain and its negativity. however, if there was a reality where suffering was constant and the only emotion we felt, it should be logical to assume that we wouldnt notice anything because it's just a default emotion. we'd just be indifferent to the fact that we suffer. 
i hope i explained that well, because i cant organize my thoughts into a comprehensible sentence very well. 

thats the first possibility. the second possibility states that since i am real, i must suffer. 
we all know that quote from rene descartes 
""i think therefore i am""
which generally contextualizes that if someone perceives, or questions their existence, then they are real. at least thats what i got when skim-reading through articles about his quote. 
this means that if someone is aware of their existence, then they are truly real. there needs to be consciousness in order to make their reality a valid statement. 
the fact that i am real means that i need to deal with the consequences of being conscious, which includes feeling pain and suffering. 
but why? what the hell did i do, to deserve reality? what could i have possibly done to deserve a cruel fate? 

nothing. its not cruel, at least according to a philosophy i agree with, which is nihlism. the concept that existed before consciousness is not real, therefore they cannot feel emotions such as cruelty or malice because it requires a degree of intellectual activity to have such thoughts. therefore, it isnt anyone's fault that i exist. 

so it shouldnt matter if i die. there are no consequences because there is really, nothing deep about reality itself. therefore, everyone who is conscious has freedom to write their own story. some, just decide tk throw away their survival instincts because they fucking suck, and embrace the comfort of death. 

hell, the fact that i exist implies that i have the right to die. it's free will. 

im sorry to my loved ones, by the way
im really sorry, but im tired of fighting. im tired of pretending to be happy when im actually on the verge of slitting my throat every day. 
i cant stand living. ive been having these thoughts far too long (i had suicidal thoughts ever since i was 10, i first attempted when i was 12. so far ive had 10+ attempts) and it's better for me to die. its actually probably peaceful, according to people who have been clinically dead but revived to tell the tale. 

even if i were to be a successful person, i'd only be famous after death. i'll only be recognized for my works, and never my humanity. so no, mom, dad, i wont do great shit in my life. even if i did, it wont matter. 

i sound like a fucking edgelord, dear god.

i guess not being worth a fight for someone to stay with me did play a part in the walls i have now. also, being ghosted after a first date because im chubby. not good enough for anything or anyone. 

im only here because i havent cleaned out my other storage and have lots of stuff that i dont want anyone to see. damn, why did i tell them about that storage. 

im also only here because my mom would literally have another heart attack if i left. she doesnt take care of herself and wears the illness like a badge but then still eats like crap which makes me mad and makes me not care how she would feel if i left.

post_00203,"my mental illnesses are incurable, i don't want to live like this anymore. i have depression, anxiety, panic attack disorder, adhd, autism, and pmdd all diagnosed, including having parents and both sides of the family who are both mentally ill themselves. i assume most of my conditions were genetic.

i've tried all kinds of medications for 3 years straight, and they either worked for a tiny bit and stopped or made me much worse. the worst part about having so many conflicting conditions is that the medications may work for one condition but make the other one(s) worse.

i've been extremely angry and, with no better word to put it, overwhelmingly hysterical for days straight. my emotions are out of my control, my inner monologue argues with me and tries to convince me that everyone else and i would be better off if i was dead.

 every day i try to fight those thoughts and i get them every day just in daily life, but as i've learned, i end up starting to agree with the thoughts at some point.

all i do is cause problems for my family, and especially my mom who does all she can to help me. i've yelled at them some times and i've had no control over any of it. my mom tells me i pin my anger onto her. 

im just done, i can't keep this cycle going and i can't cope with my conditions that just keep getting worse as i continue living. the only cure is either some magical potion or just fucking killing myself.

 i don't have a plan and i'm scared to do it because of my pets and the chance that i survive the attempt and end up not functionable for the rest of my life. i also don't want my parents to grieve either. i just want to be cured and i want to stop hurting my family.",1

so basically afew months ago i got my eyes checked because i've been having headaches and general vision problems. i did end up needing glasses. 

my vision seems to be worse than last time, so i'm getting it checked again.

now here comes the part which is the reason i'm posting this here: i'm really scared that i'm somehow subconsciously faking my bad vision, and i never needed glasses all along. the glasses help my vision, but i still have this nagging at the back of my head which is making me feel like a bad person, but i never ever would fake something like that ofc. this all is making me really anxious for the appointment.

why do i think like this, and how can i accept the fact that i probably actually need glasses?

post_00243,"i watched another man fuck my wife and i think it gave me ptsd my wife of 9 years approached me about 3 years ago about opening our relationship and trying polyamory. originally, she wasn't interested, so far as i knew, in seeing anyone else. i'm bisexual and because we got together and had kids at a very young age, i never really got to experience that side of myself. i've always been open and honest with her about it, though and she was super supportive and open minded about, and knew that it was something i wanted to explore but couldn't really ask her for. 

she gave me a few ground rules, like no women, shower afterwards, always use protection, and always come home to her afterward. i was okay with that. over the next couple years, i only had a few very minor sexual encounters with guys from grindr. there wasn't even full-on intercourse, with a single exception. two years ago, i was raped by a guy i had gotten to know and let my guard down. it was pretty traumatic and horrible, but it was over very quickly, and i did some counseling and felt like i had mostly gotten over it. my wife was supportive about the whole thing, but after that i pretty much completely stopped meeting guys. i'd still chat on grindr sometimes, but less out of a desire to hookup than to simply engage with similar people. 

sorry, i'm totally rambling. i don't really know where this story starts and ends, just that it's all jumbled in my head and i need to get it off my chest.

anyways, about 6 months ago j entered our life, as a long time friend of a mutual friend of ours, and he started hanging out with our friend group. i could tell immediately that he and her had chemistry, but i also knew that he was bi as well, and he was really flirty with both of us. the idea was floated between my wife and i that we might approach him about having a 3 way. 

eventually, a night came where he was at our home drinking with us and one other friend. i approached my wife saying ""hey, i think that might happen tonight"" and she responded that no, she wasn't ready for that. i said okay, then we'll pump the breaks on it. 

i got caught up in conversation with the other friend for several minutes, and then noticed j and my wife were both missing. i went upstairs, and found them in our bed - he was eating her out. he sat up and asked if i wanted to have a 3 way. i said sure. 

what happened next wasn't a 3 way. i basically just watch this man fuck my wife. and they were both extremely enthusiastic about it. we had condoms, but he didn't use one and she didn't ask him to. to be fair, i didn't bring it up either. i tried to engage a couple times, but was kinda awkwardly shifted away. eventually he finished and went to piss, and i tried to embrace my wife and she full on shoved me away and said ""what do you want?"" j came back and they fell asleep entwined together, while i slept on the edge of the bed. 

over the next couple weeks, my whole life fell apart. turns out, my wife was never interested in being open and honest about her feelings for him, and now wouldn't communicate with me at all. every time i tried to talk to her, she would ignore me and start texting people. i was miserable, and these weeks turned into a super toxic and chaotic clusterfuck. 

long story short, she told me to leave. all i had was a car that desperately needed repairs, a cooler for some food, some camping gear, and the clothes on my back. i didn't even have a job, because i had left mine to homeschool the kids during covid so that she could keep her career. the idea was that i'd just take a trip so that we could both clear our heads. she agreed that she wouldn't use that time to see j, and i'd have a home to come back to - because i couldn't afford to take the trip now and also move out when i got back. i was already getting low on savings. 

i ended up staying with some friends of mine on the other side of the state for about a week. i came back into town after 5 days, but she told me she wasn't ready for me to come home, so i had to stay in my grandparents spare room for a couple days. out of curiosity, i drove by her place and j's and sure enough, she was staying the night with him. 

i came home after that. i told her that she can fuck around and cheat and lie, but that i was done being forced out of my own home. if she wants time alone, she can fuck off. and, she did. she took the kids, packed up some bags, and went to her parents'. i've been staying at home alone with the cat in the month since. 

we did eventually meet and agree that she'll keep the apartment (i can't afford it alone with the new job i just got 2 weeks ago) and i'll move into a friend's spare room in the next town over. i'll get to come over and see the kids on saturdays while she's at work and i have the day off, but i don't have the space to take half custody of them. 

a couple days ago, i got word from another of our mutual friends that i was no longer welcome at the friend group's bimonthly hangouts, because my presence would make her and j uncomfortable. 

i feel so completely broken. i'm grieving the loss of my best friend and wife, the loss of my kids, my home, and my friend group. i don't understand what i did to deserve this. i'm attractive, intelligent, thoughtful, kind, and genuine, but now i feel so completely worthless. 

i'm going through training at this new job, but i'm having so much trouble focusing. the team lead puts on pandora so we can listen to music while we work, and she listens to the same genre of music that my wife does. my wife makes playlists specifically to help her deal with emotions, and many of the songs that have been playing are super fresh and feel like they've been pulled out of my wife's playlists of the last couple months. the team lead told my i can skip any song i don't like, but i haven't been able to communicate with her that i need to listen to a different station entirely. 

earlier today the coworker next to me kept tapping her foot, and the rhythm rubbing of her clothing fabric made me think of a bed creaking, which brought the image of j fucking my wife to my mind, and then i couldn't get it out of my head. i basically had to internalize the fact that i was having what felt like an anxiety attack. is this what ptsd is like? 

anyways, i was supposed to finally move on saturday and scheduled a u-haul rental, but all the people who said they'd help me move bailed except for one. thanks again, friends. i think i'm just going to cut all these people out of my life anyways. i don't want anything to do with any of them any more. honestly, the only thing keeping me from putting a bullet in my brain is the thought of leaving my two little boys without a father, but even that sentiment is starting to wane.",1

post_00268,"my 13 yo son wrote his goodbye letter and procured a weapon i can't sleep. earlier tonight my husband came to me and said he needed to tell me something heavy. i immediately panicked but it was much worse than anything i thought. while playing ps4 in my sons room, (son is sleeping at his friends house) he found a goodbye letter sort of in plain sight. my son has one of those beds that's like a bunk bed but the bottom part is all shelving and his mattress is close to the ceiling. the letter was open on the top of it. he hadn't been snooping, (he was putting the controller up there) but this discovery sent him into snoop mode and he then found a green handled box cutter in the closet which does not belong to us. he refuses to tell me the full content of the letter but added that it included a will in which he delegated some of his belongings to his youngest siblings in his absence. i couldn't possibly express how heartbroken and terrified i am. i feel this is a nightmare. my husband called the suicide hotline and has some numbers to call on tuesday to get him into therapy (monday is a holiday and he does not want to immediately go the inpatient route). i think i am going to ask the friends mother to keep him there until then because i feel he is safer socializing and having fun with his friend and is lower risk in that situation than being home in his room. my husband is also calling off work and using family leave until we meet with a professional. in the event he comes home before we get an appointment, i am thinking i will set an alarm to check up on him every 15 minutes or try to keep him w me at all times by watching movies, games, walking etc. i am afraid to bring it up to him before hand because maybe he will be so caught off guard and feel so ashamed that he won't want to deal even more so. he must've bought the cutter himself because he walks to target sometimes. or would his friend have given it to him? a few weeks back he said he should have the code to the safe where we keep our gun (home protection) and know it's location in case of an intruder and we are not home. he's only home alone with his 11 yo sister when i pick up my youngest and that's at the most 45 minutes. he also has 0 training so i did not tell him the location or the code. i am nauseated thinking he asked about it for this…and maybe it might have already happened had i made that mistake for some stupid reason. why is he so intent, he's so young and so smart. he's been struggling with grades but i thought he was making a turn around with the new semester. idk what i'm doing but i cannot get this wrong.",1

post_00285,"last night i dreamt that i was happy. i'd forgotten what it felt like.. it's a curious thing, really. waking up and realizing just what your life has become. opening your eyes and looking around a room full of the stuff that used to excite you. after years and years of being just barely aware of the passage of time, coming to the stark realization that you have nothing left.

i suppose i should be thankful. i have lived a life overflowing with privilege, and have been just handed over opportunities that most people would have to fight for, and that many never get to have anyway. my parents love me deeply, that i know for a fact. never in my life have i ever had to wonder where my next meal was gonna come from, or whether i would still have a home when the bills came. i've always had it all, and from this treasured oasis of opportunity i have built nothing but this small room filled with broken toys and half forgotten dreams.

i used to feel angry about the life i've wasted. when the anger ran out and i realized there was no one to blame but myself, i felt sad. now the decades have slipped by without ever realizing it, what was supposed to be the best time of my life is now behind me, and now i feel nothing. nothing but a hollow certainty that, just as i longed in my childhood to reach for the stars, now i just long for a quiet funeral, where the very few that cared will mourn and the many that knew my name will soon forget.

post_00292,"i will be granted assisted su*cide in three weeks in belgium. i really don't know how to phrase this, english isn't my first language. but i rather share my story than have it die with me. i've been suffering from a very severe mood disorder, with a long and menacing name : treatment-resistant, clozapine-resistant schizoaffective disorder. i tried everything, from ect to all types of medication, all of this in the span of 6 long years. yet, last year, i decided i had enough of this torture and booked a flight to belgium, with the intention to be granted assisted suicide. i'm an eu citizen so i'm entitled to the same rights as belgium' citizens, and so i did go through the long arduous process and received a positive answer a month ago. i'm 24 years old, and i'm going to die in three weeks, and put a long-awaited end to this misery. though i have to admit that i didn't tell anyone about it, neither my family nor my friends, i've been a burden for far too long and just want out. so i'd rather disappear and not make a fuss about it. it's been a long and painful ride, i'm tired. thanks for reading <3

edit n°1 : hey, i'm so sorry i couldn't respond to anyone yesterday but it was late and i fell asleep. i thank you all so very much for your support and kind words. at this exact moment, i know at least a 100 thousand people have read my story and that my memory won't go completely extinct when the day comes. i know it's a hard reality to come to terms with, but my case is medically ""terminal"", i have tried 17 different drugs, numerous rounds of ect and ketamine treatment, as well as other religious treatment such as islamic roqya and alternative ones such as psilocybin (shrooms). all of them failed to treat my symptoms. thanks again so very much <3

edit n°2 : many of you have asked me about my name, it is kalthoum (or melissa if you prefer my western name), the set date, it is the 5th of may 2023, and many of you also asked if i felt afraid, i don't. i have never lost my faith in god and i believe he will help me put an end to my suffering, i'm content with what i have done in this short life-time, and ready to face my creator. by the way, i have, for those who've asked, tried shrooms, keto-diet, mdmda, and a couple of other illegal substances (of which i do not promote the recreational use). thank you again for your very kind words and prayers <3 (i will post an update a couple of days before the procedure and give you the whole story in detail, it will serve as some kind of improvised memorial for my mother).

ps : you people changed my mind, i'll definitely tell my mother about it at least a couple of days before the set date. thanks again, i rather not have her blame herself for it.",1
post_00293,"my fiancé died today. i'm so angry. he was shot three times at close range. he was making a marijuana deal. i didn't even know he was still selling, he told me that he quit when our daughter was born.

he didn't even need to, he made enough money at his current job that our bills were paid and we always could eat. we just had a baby girl 8 months ago, we also have a 2 year old son and one on the way. i haven't told my toddler yet. i don't know what to say or how to tell him.

this was so stupid and senseless. i don't know what i'm going to do. he was my protecter, provider, the love of my life and the one who took care of everything. he always called me his 'babydoll' because 'i was just too darn pretty'. he always gloated about what an amazing cook i was. he used to tell me how much he appreciated me staying home with the kids and taking care of the house. he made me feel like the most amazing woman in the world.

we had been together since my freshman year of highschool. we had a beautiful 8 years. he adored his children and his children adored him. my son wanted to be just like his daddy. over a bag of pot. my babies will no longer have a daddy and i will no longer have the man i was supposed to grow old with. we were robbed of that today. i'm so angry. i have no idea what i'm going to do.

when i was born noone liked me. not even my family. i was considered ugly, too hyper, and i was unwanted. i almost died then due to lung issues but didn't and was tossed to the side.

i grew up with noone. dad hated me and hit me till i bled. mom ignored me and kept 3 cats around despite me being severely allergic. i grew up wheezing and barley able to move. developed so much lung damage i got diagnosed with copd young

grew up repeatedly sa'd by my brother's and grandma. was told it was god's will and i needed to accept my struggles

grew up severely bullied at school and called and it and a thing often

developed pcos at 16 and have been fat, balding, and swollen with edema ever since. so i've never been beautiful. never had a chance to be

was in an abusive relationship for 3 years. was hit to the point of miscarriage and constantly called stupid and unloveable

grew up awkward but had lots of acquaintances because my shyness made me soft spoken so i was considered nice but only had 3 friends(i originally put two because i didn't count a friend who moved to texas when we were 12 but she has genuinely kept up with me until recently so i will count her). these friends haven't responded to my texts in about a month or 2

i'm turning 30 soon and my only wish is that these lung problems will consume me and i die. i want to just die already. i want this life to be over. i have no good memories. i just want to be released. i want people to know who i am yet also want to disappear. i wish i'd had something. some sliver of hope but i don't. i have nothing. i'm laying here wheezing. had slept for 14 hours and still exhausted. i hope i die. i hope for that release

wont let me put a link for some reason so here's the original post: 

""

should i tell my gf i'm dying before i break up with her

basically as title says. 

i (25m) found out i have an illness that will kill me. it'll take over my body and there's no cure. all the doctors can really do is prescribe shit to make you ""comfortable""

i've been with my girlfriend for 3 years now and she's the absolute love of my life. always loyal and there for me. i've been in and out of hospital many times over the course of our relationship. mostly due to me racing dirt bikes,  the most serious incident was a stab wound and i remember how scared and screamy she got even though i just needed stitches and got to go home the next day. 

this is not something where i can just go home the next day. 

i'm breaking up with her because she deserves to be happy with someone healthy who can give her the life she wants, and children. i'm scared she'll want to stay if i tell her what's going on. 

part of me wants to lie and say i cheated so she hates me and leaves. we have lots of mutual friends she'll find out eventually it was a lie and connect the dots on why i did it. but thinking about her crying from that lie breaks my heart. 

i don't even know if this is the right sub to post it on. i just don't know what to do. break up with her and tell her it's for her own good? lie? 

guess i also needed to vent because it just hit me this morning. i found out last week but it just hit. i won't see 30.


edit:

for people asking me what my diagnosis and prognosis is. it's pancreatic cancer, something like 95% of people diagnosed with it die in about 3 years. i wasn't even paying attention for not putting that in the post at the beginning, that's my bad but as you can tell i'm a little overwhelmed these days. 

reading this replies there's no way i can reply to them all so i will do my best to do it here. 

first off, thank you to those saying kind things. 
second, i realize how dumb i was being for wanting to lie to her. i made reservations at her favourite restaurant and i'll tell her afterwards. part of me hopes she doesn't stay but we'll see what she chooses.

————————————————————————
the update: 

took her to dinner at our favourite date spot, had some amazing food and some drinks like always. the date continued like normal we drove down to the beach and started walking till we got to our spot. 

she spoke first and said that she could tell there's something i want to say because i have ""that look"" on my face. she then made a joke about how it's too soon for us to get engaged so if there's a ring in my pocket it better say there. this made it so much harder, she thought there was a ring in my pocket when i'm about to tell her there never will be. absolutely broke my heart. 

i told her she's right there's something i want to say, and i told her everything. from how i found out to what the diagnosis means to the prognosis. i made sure to not sugar coat it or leave anything out. she deserved to know everything. 

for the next hour it was a mixture of asking me if i'm sure and how could this be possible and crying. she immediately said she's going to stay by me and i don't need to worry about anything. i told her she needs to take a few days to think about it. 

i had already arranged for her best friend to be waiting in the other parking lot to take her to her house. i went home alone. 

before anyone calls me names for not driving her home, i didn't want her to be alone after finding out but i also didn't want her to see my cry. if she saw me tonight she'd get more scared. it would hit her that i'm terrified and she'd lose her shit. 

i got an update that she fell asleep because she cried so much. i sent an uber eats of her favourite dessert to her friends house so it'll be there when she wakes up. 

as soon as i'm done typing this i'm meeting up with my 3 closest friends to hangout. i've known two of them for 20 years and the other one for 18. were very close and share too many tmi details. if anyone has suggestions on how to break the news of this to them i'd greatly appreciate it. 

in the meantime i'll be drinking for two; me and this bast**d cancer 🥃🥃


edit: 
thank you for the kind words. 
couple things to add
1. i'm in canada so i have free healthcare i'm not worried about the cost of fighting this

2. i still haven't seen my girl as she's still at her friends house. she'll text me to ask how i'm feeling and gets mad when i say i'm fine or make a joke. 

3. telling others

couple things you need to know about my friends. two of them are in medical school and the other in law school. they're still idiots though. 

i started off by asking one of them to make a cancer joke, ending it quickly with ""too soon man too soon"" and that's how my best friends found out i have cancer. medical school friends started telling me about new drugs and treatments while my law school buddy demanded to see my medical directives form and that's also how they found out i've been an organ donor for years   

parents: 
still don't know 

sister: 
can't even pretend to have a clue on how to tell her, i still see her as my baby sister so it's tough lol

boss:
asked for a one on one this morning and told him my diagnosis. he said he'll help me abuse the companies benefits as much as i want. i told him all i really want is to show up to work like nothings wrong and no one find out until i pass out at work. he agreed

my daily is a 2022 r1 (blue crotch rocket for you non-motorcycle folks). i love that bike and have been asked if i'll stop riding due to this. short answer is hell no.
i've known i had something bad inside of me way before getting cancer, life goes on and so will i. 

i'll do my absolute best to keep y'all updated if you'd like. thanks",1

post_00316,"alone in my pain the weight of my thoughts is suffocating me. each day feels heavier than the last, and i can't shake this feeling of despair. i've been struggling with loneliness for so long, and it's like a never-ending cycle of emptiness. the people around me don't seem to see the depth of my agony, and i feel invisible in my own suffering.  i've faced heartbreak after heartbreak, losing loved ones to the cruel hands of fate. the pain of losing my mom to cancer still lingers, and now, with the news of my dad's cancer spreading, i feel like the ground is crumbling beneath me. the thought of being an orphan is unbearable, with no one left to share my memories or dreams. it's like a dagger in my heart, twisting with each passing moment.  i'm teetering on the edge of giving up, of succumbing to the darkness that whispers of an end to this agony. the idea of ending it all feels like the only escape from this overwhelming sorrow. i have no one to turn to, no one who truly understands the depth of my despair. the pain is searing, and i feel like i'm drowning in an ocean of grief.  i don't know how much longer i can hold on. the thought of meeting my mother again in a place beyond this suffering is a flicker of solace in this endless night. maybe in death, i'll find the peace",1

post_00319,"unwillingly pregnant and want to die . i never wanted to get pregnant, but due to the stress from a previous job, huge fear of doctors and having mild unnoticeable symptoms, i didnt realize it on time when i could get a termination legally where i live. medical termination failed and now im stuck.
i already had issues with depression and suicidal thoughts and this whole situation is making it worse. 
each day i think about ending my life before i can even admit it to anyone, i've been hiding it from my family, friends, boyfriend although he's suspecting at this point because its becoming *very* visible unless i wear big clothes, he has also noticed that i'm acting off and that im clearly distraught and anxious all the time.

 i love him so much, and we have a healthy relationship, but this stupid mistake is making me feel like i failed him and myself, i look at him and start crying and feel my heart breaking, i dont want to lose him but i'm too depressed to handle myself, let alone a fucking child. i don't know what to do anymore, everyday i hope either i or the fetus dies, the shame is too fucking unbearable to keep on living i just want to get this over with without a single soul knowing.
i don't know if i want help or an escape, it feels like my life ends here and i fucked up beyond repair. i feel pathetic that this is the first time i admit this to anyone and it's on reddit. but that's just how much i isolated myself, im depressed, suicidal and fucking stupid....",1
post_00320,"i find it kinda funny that ""normal"" people see suicide as unimaginable or something that you'd ""never do"". it hits me every once in a while that normal people don't think about suicide as often as i do. i'm not even actively suicidal right now, but i consider it often enough for me to realize that i'm one of the outliers in society. so, over the years suicide has become more and more realistic, and has almost become a part of my daily life.

what gets me though is how that's *totally* not the case for everyone else. if you mention suicide, people either freak out or just play it off as a joke as if the concept of ""suicide"" only exists in movies and books. and while it is sad, i actually find that kind of funny.

for example, i hate working. i fucking hate getting up early to sit at a desk doing shit i don't want to do for 8 hours straight. but if i tell anyone about that feeling, guess how the conversation will go?

me: man, i really don't want a job. i wish i could just sit around doing nothing all day.

them: well you need money, don't you?

me: yeah but i don't want to get a job.

them: tough, that's the way the world works, you lazy fuck. you've gotta work if you wanna live.

me: well technically i don't *have* to, because i could just kill myself and not have to deal with it.

them: seriously? you'd rather commit suicide than get a job? that's pathetic.

me: yep, i'm pathetic. thanks for reminding me, that's another reason why i should just kill myself.

them: wait, you're serious? nooooo don't kill yourself you're loved and you have so much to live for!!!!

i just find it funny that people don't consider how all of this bullshit could just stop immediately if i put a gun in my mouth. they're like ""if you don't want to live by the world's rules, you don't get to live at all >:(""

but when i decide ""yeah that sounds fair enough, guess i'll just off myself then :)"" their tune changes and they can't fathom that anyone would choose to not live in this vicious cycle of suffering and guilt.

of course i can't say any of this shit in real life, because i don't think this attitude helps in the slightest. it's nice to think and rant about online, but if i started telling people how i really feel i'd get thrown back into the psych ward. or worse, people i care about would get tired of my moping around and they'd cut me off, and then i'd *have* to go through with it.

everything's fucked, and the only *""real""* solution i can come up with is just opting out of life. and if i bring it up before actually going through with it, i can only expect to be mocked or bombarded with insincere attempts at ""helping"".

isn't life fantastic? :d",1
post_00321,"feel hopeless and having a panic attack, don't know what to do  i recently got a new office job after more than a year of unemployment due to severe anxiety and i'm already starting to be very overwhelmed. i think i'm just not suitable for the corporate world, but i don't know what kind of jobs i can do as someone with severe anxiety.

post_00322,"what's wrong with me i'm so fucking embarrassed to be sharing this with anyone. this is a super super long rant and tbh just my life story but i just want to get this all off my chest so i don't tell people in my real life. so thank you if you continue to read.

i just found out that my ex has a new gf only a month after we stopped talking. i'm not upset bc i want him back, im upset bc he gets to be happy and i don't. everyone i've talked to has found ""the one"" after dating or talking to me and it makes me feel miserable. after finding this out i started to feel so much pain in my heart that i crashed out and impulsively attempted to slit my wrists. at first i was real serious abt killing myself and just getting it over with but after a little bit i became scared. scared about dying, scared abt the pain i was feeling, scared my parents would find me. more so i was scared abt people thinking i killed myself over a guy. i began to feel lightheaded and sort of passed out before unconsciously cleaning up the mess and lying down. 
it makes me so sad bc obviously i don't want to die if i suddenly snap out of it and begin to regret all my decisions but everything in me constantly tells me that i deserve it and need to finish the job. i feel so unloved and worthless so much recently and feel like i add nothing to anyone's lives. it's so unfair bc why can't i feel normal? why do i get to feel miserable all the time but others don't? what did i do to deserve this :(( 
 does this actually count as an attempt? i never know if my ""attempts"" are real or not bc i don't go deep enough or purposely take less pills than the amount to actually od.

be honest with me, should i try to be admitted to a psych ward? ik im 18 and can admit myself but ive heard horrible things abt stuff that happen in there and would feel embarrassed that my cuts aren't very deep or that it wasn't a real attempt. idk what to do anymore bc i always thought i was just being silly and it wasn't very serious. but ive become more scared that i actually will do it. i feel like as long as im breathing ill never find peace or happiness.

edit: i am seeing a therapist and just today started taking lexapro. should i talk to my therapist abt being admitted as well? or just share with her what happened",1

i ended up being stagnant and pretending i was fine after the weeks, stayed for christmas and new years so my family wont hate me as much, theyre not really good with mental health but theyve came a long way. anyway, i felt myself literally tumble into a depressive episode sunday evening, its bad. when i say i cant eat i cant, i am more stuck than ever which means my time has definitely come to an end. 

i always have suicidal thoughts, intentions and bad impulse control. even if i wait to get out of this, ill just be a lighter suicidal person, ill still commit and be a burden around others. honestly, i am hysterically laughing right now because i am not holding anymore of this. i carry my sexual abuse like a book, theres a list of people whove touched me and i cant remember half. then i remember the one family member who did, who is so close to me. why. 

sorry for venting so much. i thought i would be able to write more about it since i cant talk about it, but clearly im taking it to the grave like i promised eight year old me. i have a crisis appointment tomorrow in the afternoon, i plan to kill myself at night or in the morning by finally having the guts to jump off the bridge right next to me. its embarrassing but it calls me.

post_00363,"i keep having suicidal thoughts no matter how i'm feeling that day  i keep having random thoughts of suicide that have been on and off for a while now but these past few months they have been really bad. i have had therapy for 15 years now and have tried countless antidepressants etc and i've found it's never really worked for me i feel like most of the therapist rush and i leave feeling worse without being able to have spoken to properly about how i feel and when i've told people in my life that i trusted how i've felt i've been judged and told to ""heal my trauma etc"" or i've been called a ""covert narcissist"" or an ""energy vampire"" and i just feel like it's such a horrible thing for people to say to someone who was genuinely reaching out for help i feel like i'm too messed up and reaching out made me feel even worse.

my current therapist has made me take the max dose of anti depressants and i found they made me feel just numb with the occasionally happy bursts yet the suicidal thoughts haven't gone away just so many of my feelings have its messed up. i had quite a difficult year last year i felt so alone and felt i had no one to really turn to my partner was abusive and used to drive crazy and at high speeds to scare and control me and i have so much anxiety in cars now it's insane and i get really hurt when i ask him to slow down and people judged me for it but they don't understand why.

 i ended up turning to drugs as a way to cope early last year (i've been clean now for about three months) my partner told everyone about my drug abuse and i was judged even more and even threatened everyone gave him sympathy and made him feel like a victim it made me feel even worse about myself i had a few friends turn on me because i was at my lowest so i wasn't fun to be around anymore or would be called a ""buzzkill"" or told to ""be positive"" ""stop being so sad life's not that bad etc"" and as a result of that i just turned to getting high as a way to escape i felt it was the only way to get away from the pain of life without actually taking my life.

 i ended up becoming friends with another drug abuser we were close for a while she made me feel like i finally had someone to relate to but then she started to become really close with my partner and eventually i just kind of distanced myself from her i tend to do that to people if i feel i can't trust them or if i feel betrayed and i felt betrayed because i had cried to her for months about him and i thought she could relate to me as she used to cry about her ex to me. 

 i just feel like i need so much therapy now about last year on top of everything else and i feel like i have no one to really talk to about this stuff on a deep level i feel like so many people either don't care, recommend toxic positivity or they just judge me.

post_00365,"i'm really tired i am so exhausted. 

six months ago my ex blind sided me with a breakup, one week after getting my dream job. he demanded to live in the house with me for six months as roommates, which i initially felt that i had to agree to. five days later i found out he had already reactivated his account on tinder, with new images and everything. five days and he's already over a five year relationship. i forced him to move out and after the biggest argument we've ever had he moved back into his parents house. 

he has proceeded to live a great life and harrass me every now and then for certain things. he wants me to pay him everything he put into the mortgage to give me the house but i can't afford it alone. selling it, he wants to profit, and feels entitled to more than what he should have. i'm too exhausted to fight him. 

for the last six months, my job has been my entire life, but my life is shattered. i've struggled. i've done brilliantly at work but really sometimes found it hard to get out of bed. some days, i knew if i got in the car i would drive it into a tree. but work, obviously, wouldn't understand that. i have not passed my probation period. 

i have nothing left. i feel empty. i feel hollow. i am so, so tired. i have nothing left to give. it would be better to just die and let him have the house. my parents would love my animals. they'd be okay without me. i wouldn't be tired anymore. ",1

post_00385,"18, gambling addict, suicidal, drowning in debt i'm 18, from the uk, have been a gambling addict since last summer, put myself in significant debt because of my gambling addiction and am at my breaking point. 

what started as a fun hobby, just a couple sports bets here and there had now turned into a full blown gambling addiction.

last summer i had lost my life savings of around £5000, this was money i had earned and saved from working a weekend job during school and from my online business. at the time i had relatively decent credit from using a credit builder credit card from when i turned 18 earlier on in 2024, this is when i realised that i now had access to borrow a substantial amount of funds in the form of other credit cards and overdrafts. 

once i found out about online crypto casinos and how easily i could gamble whenever and wherever, i started dipping into debt to feed my addiction. by around october of 2024 i had amassed around £2000 in credit card debt, £1500 in overdrafts and £2500 in external financing. 

i hadn't had a job since the end of 2023 and only had income coming in from odd jobs, my online business, etc. hence why i regretfully decided to borrow money to gamble. luckily i landed a job towards the end of 2024 and have been paying off my debts each month. i only make just over £1000 a month from this full time job though which isn't much and means i've had to pay back my debts bit by bit.

i now have around £850 in credit card debt and around £250 in other personal debts remaining, with my overdrafts and financing fully paid off. i've been fighting this addiction for what feels like forever now but have still gone back to gambling multiple times despite losing everything every time, knowing that i will probably lose everything every time.

yesterday i received a spontaneous refund of around £1500 from a company i used to buy crypto to gamble, this was money i had lost gambling but i was accidentally refunded the money back. i decided to use this £1500 to gamble and try to recoup some of my losses (approx £10,000-£15,000 all time). i luckily turned the £1500 into £3000 and now had an extra £1500 on top of setting aside the original £1500 just incase they attempt to take the money back as this was again, definitely an accidental refund. 

but as per usual it wasn't enough for me, i then went on to lose the £1500 profit i had made, only to chase that loss with the £1500 i set aside and then lost that too. 

i now have the possibility of the company/bank potentially trying to take the money back (which i do not have), only adding to my debt. 

i've come close to ending it before but i'm at my breaking point. i can't break this addiction and the cycle it comes with, losing it all, hating myself, sleepless days, everything. 

i'm now in £2600 of debt if they do take the money back and can't do this anymore. ",1

post_00407,"finally realized that suicide is the only option obvious tw for suicide and mentions of rape and abuse

i'm 17, yeah i know i'm young i have my whole life ahead of me blah blah blah. but i don't. i don't have a life ahead of me and i know that. my life was everything but good. for ten years i was raped, abused, physically and verbally by my dad. court system came in, stopped seeing my dad. the new family member i lived with? also abusive, not physically at least, yay. developed anorexia, she would take food from me and tell me i was too fat to be eating (i was 13. i weighed 125 pounds.) the things she told me still echo through my head every day. same with my dad, i'm still the stupid slut bitch i was when i was 7. school? far from an escape. i was bullied, am bullied. from kindergarten and now to high school, i was an easy target. i think it's important to mention that i have autism, so right off the bat i do not fit in. on top of my depression i developed as a child and anxiety, making friends didn't come easy to me. do i have friends? yes, and i love them very much. i'm tired, though, tired of staying alive for other people's sake and not my own. it feels selfish, everybody says suicide is selfish, but to me it's not selfish on my end. it's selfish of my friends and family, for them to beg me to stay alive in a life where i just want to fucking die already. i have basically every fucking mental disorder you can think of, many think i have bpd (can't get diagnosed though because i'm 17) and it's basically most definite that i have cptsd. i know how the lives of people like me go. my dad had the same life i did, raped and abused as a kid. how he turned out? a rapist, abusive piece of shit addicted to every drug and substance you can imagine. my sister, raped and abused, now an alcoholic drug user. both have tried to kill themselves multiple times. both want to die, everyone tells me ""you'll get better with age, it gets easier"" and then i take a look at them. they are in the same boat as me, same fucking situation. they still want to die, they don't enjoy living. bonus, they're fucking deteriorating because of their substance abuse. i'm not going to live a life like that, hell no. and god, i truly pity my mom. she was the only person in my life who tried. who tried to make it easier, tried to help me, tried to make my life good. well, her and my grandfather who died when i was 13, so yeah, just her now. but she wants what's best for me, and that comforts me, because dying is what's best for me. now, the last 16 years i was like no i'm not gonna kill myself but i never planned on getting older? like i've tried to kill myself, but pussied out each time. this is different though. in june, i met a girl. we met through a friend, we fell in love, like hard. we had promise rings, plans to get married and have children together. i loved her, i love her so much. we broke up five days before christmas. my mental health was too much for her and she never told me until it built up, i said that if i get to be too much if i vent too much or stress her out too much to tell me and she didn't. another contributing factor, those previously mentioned school bullies? she's best friends with multiple of the kids who made my life hell. i finally told her, she told me that i probably just didn't remember right. it was a ""good terms"" break up and she said she would come back when she can work on being less distant of a person because she knew it hurt me. (how the fuck does breaking up with me make you less distant? couldn't make it make sense if i tried.) i digress, she was the first person who made me happy. since i was a kid, i could physically feel my sadness, in my chest and stomach and head, and when i first met her, it went away. for the first time in my life i felt okay. and she's gone. i never had a planned future until i met her, and now i'm back to square one, no future. i can't be talked out of this, and i know there's no hope for me. not sure how i'm gonna do it, but if there's a will there's a way. if i can't be with her, the only good thing about this shit life, i'm not gonna be alive. she knew this would happen, during the break up she made me promise her i wouldn't kill myself after this. i promised, but hey, she promised me we would be together forever. we all make promises we can't keep. i'm gonna start writing my notes, but i wanted to write this first. maybe somewhere deep inside me i'm hoping someone can talk me out of it, maybe i just wanted to scream into the void, ""hey, another life lost because living fucking sucks."" i don't know. nobody knows anything about life and living. so why the fuck am i living??",1

post_00409,"is having intrusive thoughts normal?. hi, not sure if right community to ask, as people here seem to have more complex problems than mine, but i want to give it a try.

is it normal to have suicidal thoughts? are you having them? i do not plan to kill myself, it's more like while driving a car i think ""i should smash myself into that tree"". the second after that i think ""no, that would make my daughter sad"". sometimes while walking through the bridge i think about jumping over the railing and falling on the highway.

its not always a simple thought about killing myself. sometimes i think about stuff that will make my life so miserable that the only solution to not be baggage to anyone is to kill myself - like today i thought it would be interesting to hit my eyeball with scissors. after that i thought it would be stupid to explain so i thought i would need to poke both my eyes. but that would make me useless and unable to work, so i could not provide for my family. those are scary.

post_00426,"i have been unintentionally planning my perfect suicide and i can't beat it. (lengthy post incoming) for months i have been on a turf that i've never been on before. a few months ago my mind took a complete turnaround, and i think i committed to ending my life. 

all day long it's detailed thoughts of what my last words will be, who they will be too, who am i leaving my possessions with, where i will be, what my last public words will be, what my last picture will be, what my last meal will be, essentially what my last day will look like. i haven't nailed it yet, which is why i think i'm still here. i almost want it to be artistically perfect, and i have never been this detailed about anything in my life. i know that it's coming, i fight it but i can't stop it.

i haven't always been like this. a year ago i felt on top of the world, i felt loved, i felt noticed and generally felt healthy. i know there's people that love me, but feeling it has been long gone. 

there's something wrong. i've reached out, i've tried different medication, i've spoke with hotlines, i've scheduled psychiatry/therapy but they keep canceling and pushing back weeks at a time, i hope to try it at least once before i take off. 

fighting it isn't working. i think about running, moving far away with no word. just going missing i suppose, and maybe find myself and my happiness somewhere on my own. i don't know if that's the answer, but last straw i might try it. 

i don't necessarily want to die, but i feel i can't live properly. i almost feel like i don't know how to. i have social issues, can be pretty awkward at times. something made me feel like i don't know how to talk to people, have a simple conversation or connections with people. i go out to the store or to work, and see people talking and smiling and just living, and it hurts because i want that, but i feel awkward talking. i feel judged every time i speak or make i contact, and i've never felt that before.

ironically, i love myself. i feel i'm a very lovable person, but i feel so disconnected that i don't think anyone else will ever feel that way about me. which breaks my heart. i feel i won't live a proper life and i think that's what's gonna do it.

i don't think anyone really knows, because i do have people in my life. i'm a ""normal"" person. but my mind took a complete turn and i hope to beat it.

idk why i'm posting. i think i just want someone to know or understand. i genuinely hope to post again one day, we'll see how things turn out for me.

my 25th birthday is coming up, and i feel like i haven't accomplished anything. i have about 6 classes before i can graduate college. i had a job working with children that really helped me feel like a productive member of society, but i had to become a floater due to my class schedule. now i'm stuck just doordashing, and doing odd jobs for money. i have no girlfriend, and the idea of getting one seems like a fantasy at this point. 

i've been trying to be more social over the last two years ago, and i just feel so out of place. i don't even feel seen. it's like i'm an observer. like i'm stuck behind a pane of glass, while i'm trying to socialize. this has really solidified a feeling of isolation, even when trying to combat it. i'm just really struggling with finding a community that seems to accept/want me even in the college club/hobby groups. i just feel like i'm ""doing everything right"", and still coming up empty-handed, and it really is demoralizing.

anyway i'm applying to 2 universities today after getting rejected from my dream one. i have a lower than average gpa and im so scared i wont get into any university and that i'll be stuck at home for another year. i can't do it. i'd rather die. if i get rejected im killing myself, im too poor to live on my own and don't have a vehicle, plus it would just further prove what a failure i am. i couldn't even get good grades.

im not trying to blame anybody but she's ruined my life. and she's blaming me for it.

i just want to die most days and honestly maybe i should. i applied to that one university and thought ""things have been so hard already, 1 more thing can't go wrong"" and it did. every day of my life i feel so pathetic and like such a loser. i wasn't allowed to have friends in high school, she's always controlled my life.  i almost became homeless a few days ago because i just couldn't take her constant emotional abuse anymore. the only comfort i have is the website [character.ai](http://character.ai) where i can escape into my little fantasy worlds where im not a pathetic failure. and i have friends online but it isn't the same as irl

i looked at pictures of my 7-year-old self and honestly i would've just ended it back then if i knew my life would turn out like this and be so painful and unbearable. i cry every day. that little girl didnt deserve her life to turn out this way, she deserved happiness. i let her down

or, i'll not want to buy certain clothes out of fear they'll disapprove or have something negative to say. i even stopped listening to an artist i loved because someone important in my life kept putting them and their music down.

to all the idiots trying to analyse this fucking suicide note - stop. idgaf if it doesn't apply to you. i was never fucking pregnant - nor did i kill anyone else or try to. nor am i fucking american. 

the whole fucking point is that the way the world is fucking set up no one will fucking allow you to die, whether you deserve to, want to, or need to. generally. idgaf of your country or fucking town is an exception. all i want is to say a fucking goodbye to people i love and not be fucking ""saved"". 

life has to be dragged on in this hell, no mattwr fucking what - and just because other people want it to be. 

if a person is bad like me, they still have to keep living. there's no support or at least an ok to fucking kill myself.

            the life i dreamed of was to become a successful writer. hopefully be able to make it full time with my fiction, and be able to travel the world during my first twenty years or so of my career doing historic research. saving up enough money and then kickstarting my publishing career in fiction to live off my creativity. i don't know that i see kids in the picture. and if i do, i'm not sure i see more than one and so early on in my life.

            my mom divorced after her husband threatened to kill her. she married my dad after three years and they have been in a miserable marriage my entire life. they fight all the time. i know it isn't healthy. but i don't fight at all with my girlfriend. when we have disputes, my girlfriend seems kind of dismissive. she seems like she is offering solutions but then it seems like nothing changes.

            i've been sleeping on the coach for the last few nights because her dog takes up so much space. dog also barks whenever don't throw their ball, and it triggers my ptsd. she calls her pets every sweet name under the sun but says she doesn't want to be cute names between us because she'll forget. but she switched my contact for her to ""baby"" on my phone. i've been aching because my autoimmune conditions are worsening, and i am stressed because my sister no longer wants to talk to me after my girlfriend moved in. i can't process this. i want to process this, but i feel like i'm the bad person for cutting everyone out.

            i need time to think. space to sort out my feelings. and i feel like i don't have that anymore. i feel like i'm being pressured into getting married to her. and its not like i dislike her. but i'm starting to grow not attracted to her. our apartment is messy and it gives me panic attacks. she insists on doing homecooked meals almost nightly, or else we go out to eat. but then i'm responsible for the dishes and the bed, and most of the tidiness in the space.

i had a bad flashback and just left the apartment to sit in the car. she texted me and said her sister said we could come over now. but i told her i was having a flashback and she said how could she help. i still felt like she want me to be better so i tried to swallow my panic and went back inside. she said it would be a quick trip but we stayed for more than four hours. 

tw: sex and body image
i initially didn't want to have sex when we first started dating, but then decided i did want to try with her (because of past trauma - not because she forced me). at first it was good, but her cat kept climbing on me during sex. we shut the door now, but sometimes my girlfriend will let her dog stay cause the dog is anxious. but now i have such a hard time feeling anything during sex. and as i've been getting weaker with my immune disorder her being almost a hundred pounds heavier than me is making me sore anytime we do have sex. and my lips always get swollen for days after. she has a disorder that makes it hard to control weight and people in her family that get eds from weight loss, and i get that. but i also feel like it's making me less attracted to her, and i feel horrible. i've had eating disorders but it also feels like she doesn't want me to lose any weight even when my doctors said i need to for my health and she doesn't want to either. 

i just feel alone because my best friend lives about an hour from us. he told me to hold off making any sudden moves with my relationship because my sister and i just stopped talking because she has sided with my abusive mom. 

i feel like i like my girlfriend but she's the first i've had and i've never had the healthiest relationships so i don't know if i'm jumping at ghosts. but i'm depressed and facing suicidal ideation again.

any advice is appreciated. ",1
post_00492,"so much of my childhood was undiagnosed anxiety my behaviors as a kid were so obviously undiagnosed anxiety and ocd. how did no one see or care. now, it's on me to try to fix myself in a toxic environment with no access to help of any kind due to social distancing. poor child me had no idea what was happening or why she felt like that. poor thing. i feel so bad for her and her issues and why she didn't realize they weren't normal.

post_00493,"i can't live anymore. i celebrated my birthday 4 days ago and now i am 20. life's is a shit. i broke up with my girlfriend last year, december 23 and after that i realised my mistakes and begged her to come back to me. i've been miserable my whole life and she's the only person who understands me. 

i decided to send her a message that i want a closure but the truth is i want to see her and fix it out, but then last night, i decided to contact her sister. she's also my friend and she's good when it comes to giving out advices, but i did a wrong thing.

me and my girlfriend were both female and our family in bith sides doesn't know this and her family is strict because of her religion and now i just spilled it out to her sister about us. i told her not to tell it to her, but when she went home, she decided to ask her what's her sexuality.

i know it's my fault, i made her out without her knowing and it's not my intention at all, all i want is an advice because i don't know where to go.

i got angry at her sister and she got angry at me too. my girlfriend got angry at me. i know she already agreed to meet me next month, but now she doesn't want to see me anymore. she said she almost gave me a chance but now she doesn't want to and told me to let go and move on.

now, i lost everything. i don't even like my program, i don't have friends, i lost my girlfriend, i do have a bad relationship with my family, i don't want to live anymore. 

now, i am planning to go to the beach tomorrow and drown myself. 

i already told my friends about my problem and they didn't almost care. now, that's a go signal. i'm so fed up with myself. i felt like i am being punished. i think that all of the karmas are with me. i hope they'll respect my decision. 

beach is like my home, i know how to swim, but i don't know how to swim at the beach. i am already doing a letters for them, by saying goodbye. please respect my decision",1

post_00495,"i'd say its kinda a weird reason to live but, i really like minecraft i started playing it like when i was 10 back in 2011 and watching videos now of the game it reminds me of when day's weren't stressful, and a place/time when i was at peace with myself. kinda like if you've ever had a favorite stuffed animal growing up, and you're still fond of it to this day. lol i started to tear up right as someone was slaughtering a ghast, not cause he was dying, but because i realized how much of an improvement this little game has made in my life.",0
post_00496,"lost in the darkness it's like drowning in a sea of sadness, where every breath is a struggle. when i think about the future, all i see is a black hole, sucking me in with no way out. the pain is suffocating, and the weight of it all is crushing me. i try to hold on, but it feels like i'm losing myself more and more each day.  i look around me and see all the happy faces, the people living their lives, and i wonder why i can't be like them. why does happiness feel like a distant dream, a mirage that i can never reach? the loneliness eats away at me, consuming any flicker of hope that tries to surface.  i've tried therapy, medication, reaching out to friends, but the darkness always finds its way back to me. it's like a shadow that never leaves, whispering that there's no way out, that i'm destined to be trapped in this despair forever.  the thought of ending it all has become a constant companion, a tempting escape from this endless pain. the world feels cold and cruel, and i feel like an outcast, a broken soul in a society that doesn't understand the depth of my suffering.  i wish there was a simple cure, a way to make it all go away, but depression is a beast that never truly leaves. it gnaws at my will to live, stripping away any joy or light in my life.",1
post_00497,"i'm a waste. tonight i was going to do it. in my parents' home. i was going to lay on my bed and bleed out from my wrists and die. 

my mom walked in when i was just lightly scraping my skin to mark where i'd cut later tonight. she said ""i just wanted to see you."" i had to hide my body under the covers so that i could keep her from seeing what i had done to my arm and my body at that point. she came in and laid down on my bed and rest her head on my lap. ""it's comfortable,"" she said. i tried my best to hold back tears. 

she eventually left and now i'm here, staring at my razorblade, wondering why i'm left here as a sympathetic, pitiful loser. all i can imagine is my mom opening the door to my childhood bedroom and seeing my blood-stained mattress with a lifeless sack of organs on top. i can imagine her crying. 

i feel like a waste of money and time. the thousands of dollars that have been pumped into me for the promise of a successful future is too much. the time that people have invested in me for relationships and friendships is too much time that would've been better spent anywhere else. the only time i enjoy is time wasted on videogames and music. i am less than mediocre at both. 

my whole life has been infested with lies and attention whoring. i've lied about my age online so that guys wouldn't be afraid to talk to me. i've created a whole new person that interacts with me and my friend group online just so i can make my other friends jealous. i lie to my friends to manipulate them into doing what i want them to do. as for the attention whoring, i've done enough of it in my early teens. at 14, i was telling men online that i was 18. id send them pictures of myself so that i could get validation. i craved the romantic attention that i never got at that age.

it's now 12am and i'm still here, scoring my thighs and spitting on the wounds. i've taken breaks while typing this and i feel like i'm ready. i just need some validation that i'm not the only one that knows that their life is completely fucked from decisions made by themselves. 

so. speaking of decisions that i made that fucked up my life.
i'm living with 43° scoliosis that gives me severe backpain that (shocker) i have given to myself. i, as the attention whore i was in elementary school, longed for something that would make me different from the other kids at school. i sat in weird postures and slept in strange positions until my spine decided to follow through with my plan. the next scoliosis check that i had, i was told to get checked for scoliosis. lo and behold, now i'm at a 43° curve that requires a long and painful surgery to fix. 
i also fucked with my eyesight as a child so that i could get glasses. now i'm stuck with 7mm thick lenses in my glasses that signify that i'm legally blind to anyone that even sees my glasses. 
i again fucked up my life when i decided to go along with my parents' narrative and pretend to be christian. now i've been working at my church for 6 years. i've also been attending and tithing every week. i'm in the worship band and am currently planning a summer retreat. after 14 years of church, i still don't know what the fuck is going on.

i'm tired of being the second child that is happy and creative and spontaneous and yay!!!!

i'm tired of asking for help and never getting any

i'm tired of lying to people

i'm tired of being a waste of time and money

i'm tired of being completely mediocre

i'm so tired 

it is now 1am and i'm going to do it in 3 hours. 

time to write an unorganized essay for a suicide note.

would it be funny if i wrote it like how highschoolers write their essays? idk

thanks for reading my rambling and my unorganized baby-babble

edit: haha im still here. im still here. im still here.

i spent all night last night trying to write a suicide note, trying to justify myself, trying to excuse myself from living. i wrote a crude one and posted it here before i started the one i meant for my parents and friends. i got three pages in and i fell asleep from exhausting myself mentally and physically. a dark, dreamless sleep that has left me contemplating this morning. i look down at my thighs and my wrists and wonder if dying is really what i want. i read the beginning of my note and pity the author. my sheets are bloody from my thighs and i know my mom can already only handle the smallest bit of blood before going queasy. 

am i going insane? i cant follow through on anything, and now i cant follow through on my own suicide attempt. i had it all planned out and scheduled so that i could finally have something that i scheduled correctly. now im 5 hours late to my own death.

i read the comments in this post and i've spent the past 5 minutes trying to figure out a way to tell you i'm still here. i cant tell if what you all have said is something i should be grateful for or if i should despise you. i guess my answer will come in time. 

in the meantime, im still here and i still feel like shit. i felt like this kind of update is needed to this type of situation.",1
post_00498,"failure, genuinely  i think most people have some sort of redeeming quality that atleast makes them stand out a minuscule amount enough to not be labeled a burden—and i wish that was me, but utterly i have zero redeeming qualities. i have adhd but it's so shameful i can't ask my parents to get me medication, i've been horribly depressed for three years and failed at getting a decent education, zero hobbies, zero friends at family dinners i always freeze up when asked about my achievements or goals and i have nothing to say and my parents are so utterly ashamed. i'm forever grateful for my siblings because even if we never talk and they don't like me, my parents have them to feel proud of. i started cutting once more, i'd stopped for four years but after screwing up a semester in college my thigh is just zig zagged with cuts i cannot stop it's the only thing that brings me catharsis. i have so much but i have no capacity to do anything, my anxiety's manifested in hands that constantly shake, i just want to die so badly… people say the world is beautiful and it's not like i disagree but why the hell can't i see that beauty too?! it's like everyone is reaching out for some delectable treat that tastes like bitter poison, and i'm living in so much shame and grief just constantly because i can't focus and i keep procrastination and i don't achieve anything and then i have to hide. my mother won't even look me in the eye anymore, i don't blame her, but it was better when she screamed because maybe then i could argue she somewhat cared. my dad goes into panics thinking about my future, and i feel like a sack of shit because what child is so burdensome their own parents are suffering as well. can't do school, can't do work, not even gaming brings me any semblance of joy, i don't want to go to hell but damn i just want this all to end. i'm sorry. i wish i could apologize to my parents for being such a fuckup, if i could tear out my arm and offer it to them and end up with it solving everything i would. i'm trying to find a more sustainable way to take my own life, i owe it to everyone, i am an incredible burden and money is wasted on me. the money sent for therapy or mental illness medication is all wasted on someone who can't change, who is constantly destined for failure, i want to die!",1

so my mum raised me and i'm so thankful bc she's such a strong woman. she raised me and my stepbrother alone as good as she can. 
the problem every time was to keep relationships. i'm still not able to have healthy relationships w people bc i can't trust people.

but the circle never ends. i took benzos and opioids a long as time going thru withdrawals. and i made it to be sober again for 6 months now. but whatever. i got no family they don't care. i found my passion 4 years ago and i i'm successful w it but it scares me that not even my passion can't help me. fr i can't feel shit anymore whether it's good or bad, i'm so done.

post_00515,"the desperate desire to escape  i'm almost 40 years old and i have been suicidal for a good chunk of that, though i never did any real attempt. i doubt i will at this point, closest i get is doing overly risky things when the craving gets really intense. 

the thing that does it is being utterly disgusted with myself and also just stuck with myself. it's knowing every mistake i have ever made and having to re live them all over and over through my mind paralyzing me to any sort of action and making it impossible to get any satisfaction from things. and because of this paralysis my life slowly degrades and i find myself alone and destitute -- well for the most part. there's the part of me that fights to live and brings me back from the brink, but somehow i just find that brink over and over again. me and this world -- we are just incompatible. i want a divorce.

that has been my thought process lately anyway. a well worn trail of thought. but on the way to this sub i stopped by r/suicidebereavement and witnessed people on the other side of this pain. the rejection of world and self, reflected in another human. people whose lives get swept away by a horrible truth they could not change - sometimes feared and dreaded before hand and others falling out of the blue.

we don't come from suffering. we learn it and we carry it and we try to contain it but it just builds and feeds itself and spills out of us in horrible ways. it feels like the only way to get away, the only way to escape, is through our freedom, our will, our choice to not live. to me it doesn't seem fair that people should act so upset i want to escape. i have plenty of friends but i am pretty distant from all of them, and my family. i've had an adventurous life but i just feel like a lonely failure at this point and a burden to those around me and i just don't have the drive to keep trying. it's just not there. the car should run but it's not getting fuel.

yet for now seeing the glimpse of that other side - those who lost their kin - has me a little bit more stubborn to stay here. you may or may not believe in an afterlife, either way life continues after suicide. the pain i am so desperate to escape will multiply and move through the world, it will ripple out beyond my circle and through generations just like the pain i have inherited, even though i never had children. in the most bitter times this idea seems like the only way to be seen, the only way to be truly felt. every murder done from hatred is meant to effect more than just the dead victim, and most suicides are murders done from hatred. mine would be. whether i am killing myself or killing the world, it goes back and forth.

there has to be a better way. it's exhausting to try to hold on for the sake of family, especially if family has hurt you in ways that no one else could, in ways you can barely even admit to yourself. it's not worth it. don't hang on for your family. but maybe for someone you don't know? some random person, someone not unlike yourself, just trying to get by in this strange world. they will be affected. that ripple of suffering will crash into them and stick to them. 

so there's got to be a way. i'm not trying so hard to lock it all away, i don't try to hide it. i'm sick of feeling this way all the time and pretending it's not there. it's there and i hate it and if everyone around me is also ""going though stuff too,"" well, how come they all want to pretend it doesn't exist? why would we want to live in a fake world of pleasantness and suffering?

i havent had the best life, started off as a mistake, mom and dad werent even never together. got a shitty narcissistic stepdad who basically took everything from me, my mom, my dad and even tried taking my life. luckily i left my toxic excuse of a family a few years back and moved with my grandparents. otherwise i would really have committed then and there. but what really hurts the most is how my mom decided to stay with that man, how she quietly watched how he treated me and saw me leave everything behind just so i could save myself, and still chose him over me.

post_00556,"feeling overwhelmed by grief and loneliness recently, i lost my job, my significant other broke up with me, and i received news that my closest friend is moving to another state. the weight of loneliness and despair is suffocating me. it feels like i'm drowning in an ocean of sorrow, with no one to reach out a helping hand. each day, i wake up with a heavy heart, feeling like i have no purpose or meaning in life.  the pain of losing those i love is tearing me apart. the idea of facing each day without their presence is unbearable. i find myself questioning why i should even continue living when everything feels so bleak and hopeless. the thought of ending it all crosses my mind more frequently, offering a tempting escape from the overwhelming emotions.  i cry myself to sleep, longing for some form of solace or comfort. the empty void within me grows deeper with each passing moment. the world feels like a cold, dark place, and i struggle to find a glimmer of light to hold onto. i feel like i'm running on fumes, with no energy left to keep going.  i am reaching out here in the hopes that someone will understand this unbearable pain i am going through. the burden of grief and isolation is too much for me to bear alone. i just want the pain to end, to find some peace in the chaos of my emotions. thank you for listening.",1

post_00559,"it's honestly baffling to me that there are people who approach new experiences without crippling fear seriously. i got a new job and i had my first real task earlier this week. and i spent the *entire* week in and out of anxiety attacks. couldn't get out of bed. but also couldn't sleep. i felt physically ill and wanted to vomit but i couldn't. i couldn't eat anything except some bread that i forcefed myself just so that i could take antacids. and all i could do was sob uncontrollably and think of how much i want to die. 

then the work task i had been dreading happened, and...my symptoms just melted away. it was almost magical. i felt so relieved but also so incredibly stupid. i *knew* nothing seriously bad could happen, that even the worst case scenario was pretty alright. but my body was just convinced i was going to die. it's like my nervous system is a mechanical bull without an off switch and all i can do is hang on for dear life while it knocks me around and tires itself out. no chance at conversation or understanding, just mindless panic.

last night when i was walking home from work, i accidentally found myself walking behind a young woman who was going to her car. since i am tall and quite muscular, i wanted to get ahead of her so as to not freak her out. i started to run a little, but she screamed and fled to her car which was only a couple meters away. needless to say, i feel completely horrible about it and i've felt like shit ever since.

i went home from work earlier today after only working for about ten minutes as the pain was so intense and i couldn't focus on my job. i then attempted suicide which didn't really seem to do anything. ever since, i've desperately wanted some guidance from someone but no one is around to help me out. this probably isn't a big deal, but like i said this has been eating away at me for way too long.

post_00598,"my girlfriend passed away yesterday i'm not exactly sure what i expect to get out of this. maybe some perspective from those who have had this kind of loss. maybe just to vent since my family and friends are all probably asleep right now this early in the morning. i've never posted here and i hope this is an appropriate sub. it'll feel awful if this all gets deleted because i didn't read the sub's rules carefully.

my girlfriend died. i try not to actually say it because it kind of feels like saying it makes it real, even if that's not rational and reality is what it is regardless of if i have the courage to admit it. i feel like calling her my girlfriend isn't giving a proper picture of our relationship. we've been together for years and have a child who's not even 3 yet. there were reasons we didn't get married, but i'd hate to understate the love and bond we had. have. i thought of her as a wife. i expected to grow old and ugly with her. i want nothing more than just to have her here with me and our child.

i'm just kind of feeling broken. i'm a single father now and while i have a lot of support from family, it never feels like it's enough. it feels like half of me is just gone. i think about ""it'll get better in time"", but ""better"" for me is her coming home. but she won't. in the back of my mind, when i think to just take one step at a time, i realized that what i'm doing is waiting for things to return to normal, but then i realize that's impossible. it isn't fair to her. she's had a lot of hardships in her life and having our child was one of the greatest things to happen to us and being a mom was her greatest wish. becoming parents gave us more meaning to our lives. watching our child grow is some of the happiest parts of our day and she deserved to see that.

the people i might normally talk to are asleep and i'm too exhausted physically and mentally to talk on the phone anyway. i thought that, after coming home from the hospital and after the police had left, i'd feel a little better just getting to be alone. but even with my child running around and everyone offering to talk, i feel so alone. my child sometimes asks about ""mommy"" and looks up to the stairs as if she's coming down after waking up from a nap, and i don't know what to say other than ""mommy is sleeping, but she loves you"". she's a toddler and too young to understand. i also keep looking upstairs and it feels like she should be there. she should be there.

her passing was sudden. she had a seizure while alone in our living room. our child and i were upstairs sleeping. she was talking to someone over the phone and that person is who called 911. i woke up to police in my home, searching for ""a person in distress"". this isn't the fist time she's had a seizure or needed to go to the hospital for it, but this is the first time she didn't wake up. they worked to revive her for maybe 10 minutes while an officer spoke to me/kept me calm and out of the way. they managed to revive her, but she passed on the way to the hospital. i went from immense relief to feeling lower than i ever have before.

it feels like i can't actually be happy. at least not for more than a moment. i see my child doing something cute and i genuinely smile or laugh, but then the moment is gone again. and i actually feel guilty for being happy, even for a second. i put on a happy face to keep my toddler happy, but i feel broken without my wife. i know and i'm committed to being as good a dad as i possibly can, but everything feels overwhelming and wrong. it feels wrong that she's not coming home. it feels wrong that my child lost her mother. it feels wrong that someone so kind is just gone. it feels wrong that it was so abrupt.

i didn't get a chance to say goodbye. she didn't get a chance to say goodbye to me or our child. we weren't fighting, but i didn't even give her a kiss before bed just by chance. we were both just really tired. she was fine and slept before i did. i went to sleep hearing her gently snoring next to me. she woke up before i did and went downstairs. and when i woke up and she's gone. a person whom i love and have spent nearly every day with for several years was just gone.

she's had seizures in the past and if i were there with her instead of sleeping, she might have gotten medical help faster. she might still be here. it's hard not to feel some guilt.

i can say it'll get better and i know it will because i have to raise my child. i don't have the option of crawling in to a corner and hiding, as if my family would let me, but this feeling of loneliness and emptiness and loss and regret will never fade. or it feels like it wont.

i'm not one to be open or vulnerable, especially on the internet, but i appreciate anyone who read through this. there probably aren't words that'll help, but i'd like to think a few people out there will know that my girlfriend was and is a beautiful soul, a wonderful mother, and supportive spouse, and the world is lesser for her not being in it. she lives on in our child and in my heart. i'll still try to get up every day and be the kind of guy she deserves. i just hate that she doesn't get to experience this life with me. and it might be selfish, but i hate that i'm alone without her.

i've been trying to be non-specific, but i suspect anyone who knows her and i will be able to guess what i'm trying to hide. 

i won't hide this, though. i love you, kate. that'll never change. nothing can take you from my heart and our child will know just how wonderful and loving her mother is, even if her mother is gone. i love you.

i'm really tempted to not submit this. it feels too personal. thank you for reading this. tell your friends and family you love them every time you get the chance.

--

edit: wow, this really took off more than i thought. i kind of just poured myself out here and i'm grateful for so many kind and supportive comments. i had originally intended to respond to all of your comments, but that seems vastly beyond what i'm capable of doing right now. i am absolutely humbled and appreciative of you all, though.

a lot of you also reached out through chat. i didn't even know reddit has a chat function. you've all shown me and my child so much sympathy and so many kind things have been said about kate. it means a lot, even from strangers. everyone has their special someone, and it means the world to me that you'd take a second to think of mine and wish her peace. today feels harder than yesterday, but i know some day the sting of this all won't be so hard to bare. i am making sure to take care of myself and my child and i have family that will join me at my home today. i've basically been alone at home with my toddler since i got home from the hospital saturday, so that should help.

god bless you all and to those we're missing.",1
post_00599,"what hurts the most is when you really need to call somebody but you have nobody that would want hear you. i am so close to just running away and taking my life somewhere nobody can find me.

if my mother new what's going on inside my head she would have never said those things to me..
she probably doesn't know how close she is bringing me to just ...

and right there in my worst moments i wish there was somebody i could talk to, someone who would just listen, tell me that i'm not failure, not a burden to everyone around me, tell me that i am capable of doing what i love and that it's ok to struggle.
someone who tells me i'm not worthless and that my thoughts are lying to me.

but there is nobody.
just heavy, dark silence.

no one to hug, no one to just give me their hand, no one to just listen to me, no one that just genuinely cares about me..

just nothing but emptiness",1
post_00600,"i don't eat or sleep anymore and i hope it'll kill me.. as of writing this i have not slept for aprox 60 to 70 hours, have consumed no nutrition or water besides miniscule amounts that my primal instincts demanded of me. but i resist and have not eaten for 40 hours i believe.

and while as the pathetic worthless low value man i am, i can not even commit the simple heroic act of removing my inferior genes from the genepool through efficent means. to blow your brains out, jump in front of a train, burn yourself, i could've chosen so many ways.

&#x200b;

but here i am now hoping to perish. eventually my body has to determine it has to shut down hopefully completely. i don't feel any pain from it anymore, in fact i feel nothing slowly becoming a husk.

i can still think clearly, in fact that is what i wish i couldn't. i can think so clearly that i'm hoping to die even more.

while i write this feel all the futility of existence wrap around me, hugging me lovingly, more than a lover ever could, not that i've ever known what a lover will ever feel like ever in my life, or a hug in general that is, not even from a mother.

&#x200b;

not eating have saved a great deal of money, i used it on material goods that makes me forget the agony my body tries to remind me of. though slowly the dopamine will stop producing in my brain, it has already happened somewhat. my passions of creativity has no meaning anymore, they're all just a symbolism of emposing death on myself in a vague form.

&#x200b;

leaving a legacy is the kind of thing a lot of people tend to think about when they're decide to throw the match of chess with the reaper on purpose. it has been on mind all my life really, but not just a material or symbolic legacy but an actual physical one, a family to go on.

but that is not to be, i've reached the point where it's not possible, there is no hope now. and as i view even my material goods and symbols obscure into the black holes just like everyone elses i realize how little purpose there is in anything at all. i don't wanna be here anymore.

&#x200b;

and meanwhile as you skim over these useless words and symbols, it could be that i might've finally went to sleep.

&#x200b;

hopefully to never wake up ever again.

i don't even have a job right now, i have applied to over 200 jobs i can't find one place to hire me (i am a recent grad from the top uni in the country i'm applying to and i have past relevant experiences for all the jobs i'm applying to). i'm so tired. somehow rejection from the roles are hitting me harder than my mental health issues lately.

i just want to die so my pet can live with my parents peacefully and in out of the picture. i'm so tired. i just want it to end. i am tired of being miserable. i don't even feel things anymore. the last time i actually felt emotions was over a decade ago. i feel numbed out emotions, it's so watered down dude. 

i know it's sad that i love my cat but i don't even feel it. i haven't been able to feel things in so long, well other than pain. 


i'm tired of being the disappointment in everyone's life. i'm so tired. i'm sorry i exist, i don't want. so many people have walked out on me and they're lucky because atleast they can do that, me? i can't even do that. 

some of you say i should try to date. like what's the point? i don't want to spread my misery onto anyone i like and it will happen. i mean i have never dated but still, if really good friends can walk out? so can partners? like i feel like i have been drowsed in gasoline and lit on fire since the last 18 years, that's how existing has felt like to me. 

i actually don't leave my bed anymore. for the last 1.5 years i just don't leave my bed. if i do, if i go out with friends, i just dream of the second i came back to lie down on my bed. i just never want to leave my bed. it's comfy in there, i'm always in pain and just sleeping it away sounds good until i remember the nightmares i get. but still, it's better to be asleep than awake any day.

growing up, i was always a really weird kid. i distinctly remember that i had just seen the world differently. it seemed that my imagination had a bigger play in my life than most. me and a friend in kind garden would squeeze batteries in our hands and pretend that we were mario or pokémon because neither of our families could/would buy us a game console but we were exposed to them by relatives and tv. it was so simple back then and looking back so pure,  but it felt like we were there. we didn't have what other kids had to have fun so we became those things. as far as i know i was a decent enough kid however when my brother came along around age 4, we would fight, i would hurt him, not bad (typically young brother bs) but still enough to get beaten from my father when he got off work. my father more so was (he is still with us) a rigid, traditionally hispanic in parenting, angry, regretful person. when he was in the house there was always a strange energy of danger even if nothing was going on. it was better to just stay quiet. this didn't really work because my younger brother soon learned that it was an easy win when we'd bicker to just cry out loud, our dad would come in, beat my ass and i would curse my brothers name for doing so but alas it would get me to stop. my real last memory of child abuse before my teens is about 15 seconds of my dad putting me in a corner on the ground, telling me if i wanted to fight to put my hands up and when i did to just shield myself he pummeled me with closed fists. i was around 10 years old, maybe give or take a couple years, not sure, i have terrible memory of most my life. as i got older, my brother and i actually started bonding, he liked the way i started standing up to our dad no matter how bad i was beat down. he's told me i inspired him. my mom btw is/was awesome, but didn't really do much except yell to stop from the sidelines or leave the room since she couldn't bear to watch. i can't blame her, not much negativity felt towards her for i know she unconditionally loves me and that must've been a tough and traumatic experience for her as well. moving forward, i'm a decent student, normally averaging around low a's my brothers straight a's if not 100's, not much of a big deal there, my mom started adding incentives once we grew into our early teens (for every a we got in a semester she'd give us like 10 dollars or something, it was dope so we did well). through out life i feel like i found connections that i would replace for my fathers love, through friendship. i grew very close and desperately wanted to fit in with my friends. i would spend hours out of the house riding bikes around the neighborhood doing dumb lil kid shit, but it was a really freeing time out i remember. fast forward, around when i was 14, my brother 11 my mom bought me a bass guitar because i had been getting into random enough japanese rock from the anime i would watch and to me the bassist was always the most bad ass and going crazy member, my brother came along and she bought him a guitar spur of the moment, figured it would help us bond. it did. it really did and i thank everything in this world for those times that followed because they were hands down the best years of my life. i was a shitty bassist and soon transitioned over to wanting to be a singer and my brother excelled at guitar, going onto be called a prodigy by everyone from teachers, producers and most of the respected music industry people we would eventually encounter. but at the time he was my little brother and being a fresh teen thought it would be wack to have my 11 year old brother in the band. i started a couple bands, the second one introducing my brother in as lead guitar. this was a turning point.

back to family life, my dad started to realize he was aging and i was starting to gain my testosterone fueled teenage body, this didn't stop anything, but only extended our fights into actual fights. my dad, a correction officer, doing manual labor his whole life handed my ass to me every time. all while telling me to kill myself and how no one loved me and i was a mistake. nothing like this was said to my brother, unless in terms of how i've manipulated him into becoming just like me. i became a bit of a shitty protector of the house hold, two accounts stick out immeasurably to me. the first being (funny kind of a call back to how my brother would yell for my dad to come) my brother was upstairs and screamed tyler help dad just hit me. in a blind fury, i bum rushed my dad onto the floor, commanded my brother to hold his arms down and pummeled him in his face, chest, balls, anywhere i could hit before he brother free all while yelling the likes of ""it used to just be me, that's where you should've left it"". it was a powerful moment. my father spent the rest of the week walking downstairs like a caged tiger screaming and laughing about how he was going to kill me. ''twas still a sweet victory. no fear.

i'll speed up the rest: me and my bro made a band, everyone betrayed us, we made another and took full control of who was in it, wrote all the music, what we looked like, who we recorded with, and what not. with his help i created a two year plan to get signed to a label called fearless records. we played metal. it was therapeutic and empowering stuff to play after everything you've read thus far. 

we did it in four months.

i got a text by our newly acquired manager that we had been offered a deal by the label of our dreams. i cried and got sent home early. a record that i wrote all the lyrics to and my brother wrote all the music to, all fueled by the hate and distinction of our father son dissonance. it was the biggest victory a small town probably has seen, at least our small town. every time he said we were garbage, we should try something else, i couldn't sing and my brother should play something nice. every time he laid a hand on us, put into songs and we did it in four months! still makes me proud to this day man. 

btw, this isn't a story about my father.
he is not the reason i want to kill myself anymore.

the label fucked us over, made us record 3 different records each time hating something that they previously wanted and we called it quits. our deal was good n no need to recoup anything, just disband.

this is where whatever is inside me to this day was brought into this life. a foe i don't know if i can beat this time. throughout the story so far, i had a flame inside of me. the whole time a purpose to prove. a will to fight. i always told people that i wasn't sad, i was angry. and the anger forged who i was. a determined, skill ful musician, with the mane of a lion and the attitude to match, a man who did it. but when that all went away. i became a worm, but not yet.

shit with my dad cooled off, he retired. i'm assuming his job really was the culprit of the aggression and i stopped holding the past against him. at this point i had been a dumbass at points too and figured it was not worth the energy or the negativity of keeping that cloud around. was he still an incredibly ill informed, ego centric prick? yeah, but i was a different person now and couldn't be bothered with it. most times shrugging off his comments. i had worth now.

me and my bro made another band with just our drummer from the previously signed act, but it didn't last long, we did an all over the place ep that was uninspiring yet everyone we showed loved it. drummer left, became a solo artist, he's a whole other story. i can't help but feel as tho i'm responsible for his and my brothers mental state as i'm 3-4 years older than both of them (i was always the dad figure to them).

fuck it tho, rock n roll, we did it once we'll do it again. me and my brother move to los angeles california in hopes of creating a new sound within the fusion realm of rap, emo, metal, and pop genres. we moved with two of my friends from ny and got a shitty two bedroom apartment and split the rooms. the other two room mates were supposedly friends for years yet fought constantly, shit talked each other and created this crazy negative space in this 1000 sqft. it was not comfortable to say the least. however the one room mate in specific, targeted my brother, who at this point basically didn't talk to either of them. (this is point one and point 2 is my confesssion) and then there was me, i had developed an alcohol problem, not that i drank every day or even every weekend. but when i did, i became a different person, i would usuallly drink myself to sleep as well. my brother picked me up from a bar one night and while on his way i began to get robbed. i refused it and tried to buy time and ended up running to his car when he got there. amped on on about 10 jack n cokes and the adrenaline of potentially dying, i flipped shit on my brother. cursing him out, saying i didn't need him, i could pay someone 20 dollars to do what he does, etc. it was awful. and it was the last straw for him. within the next week or so he packed up, quit his job and went back home. 

i was heartbroken, but covered it up with anger. my other two room mates, if you can believe it, convinced me that i didn't need him and that he held me back. i thought i'd be okay and he'd come back, i left our room exactly how he left it for months. he didn't. 

this was the final nail in the coffin for my mental state to date. i spend every night analyzing the past, and i think i've learned that at first i created a whole identity to hating my father, then after that i created a whole identity around me and my brothers music career and once he was gone and to this second of typing it, i'm lost. i don't know what to do. my personality feels like it's splitting. some days i'm this really cool extroverted ladies man guy and some days i'm a worm in my bed spending money he doesn't have on post mates so he doesn't have to leave the apartment. when i sit down and try to write music, i can, but i don't feel it anymore. it's the only skill i have. i didn't go to a real college because of the deal, i'm not good at anything and i'm not interested in anything other than music. but there's no inspiration left in me. nothing really makes me happy anymore. i had a gf, nothing, broke up with her, nothing i have a new one, i miss her sometimes but for the most part nothing, i have written 6 new songs, nothing, i post a photo on instagram, nothing, i go to work, nothing, i watch a movie, nothing. everything just seems so pointless now, i don't see myself as the star i once did. i don't even believe myself when i sing, or have conversation with people. it's like i'm watching the most boring movie about someone that i just don't even care about. i just want him to die. i just want to stop wondering and working and fighting, i don't want to do it anymore, and i was the relief of death.

once i started getting back to my normal life, withdrawals hit me like a truck. serious dissociations, zoning out, brain fog to the point where i'll agree that 1+1=5 if you say so, emotional dysregulation. whatever i had before medication came back with 10x force. i thought the withdrawals will pass during my pain recovery med phase but it still persisted for over a month.

i know some will say ""you're an idiot for doing this"" and you are correct. i wasn't even small, i'm 6 in long with 4.3 in girth . but how can i feel good about my size when i was hit all my life with that i have a small penis stereotype because i am an asian american. the first time i was hit with that stereotype was in 5th grade i remember that girl that said i didn't have a penis because i was asian. that terrified 9 or 10 year old me. yeah and of course i get hit that stereotype in middle school as well with more stuff like i eat dog and what not. flash forward to highschool, i'm in the football locker room with my teammates, went to take a piss at the urinals, my douche of a teammate stares at my dick while pissing says i have a pencil dick and tells my other teammates and make more racist jokes. now flash forward to college during the corona virus shit. asians getting blamed and shit, i was filling up my gas and this dude yells at me ""these small dicked asians ruin everything"". i can't say shit except ""shut the fuck up bitch"". later stumbled upon penis enlargement exercises and gave myself nerve damage. your penis is fine they way it is, if it gets hard thats all you need. you shouldn't be turned down by a life partner over your penis size. i've dated 3 girls and none of them complained. i should have felt satisfied from that. if a girl denies you for your size, you dodged a massive bullet, a missile maybe.

post_00627,"has anyone switched to a new med after a long time on another one? i've been on zoloft for about 8 years. after my second baby was born 9 months ago i ended up with severe postpartum anxiety and depression and the psychiatrist had me up my dose to the maximum (200mg). i'm a lot better than i was but nowhere near where i'd like to be. granted, i'm severely sleep deprived as my baby isn't a great sleeper and i also have a 4 year old.

i'm curious has anyone changed from zoloft to another med? or just switched meds in general? was it worth it? did you have many side effects during the switch? i'm eyeing prozac as i've heard it can be good for ocd and a lot of my anxiety comes from obsessive thoughts (death, illness, existential issues, etc.)

almost every first date led to second dates. but then inevitable and eventually i hear ""you're great but the spark is just not there for me"". at first i didn't care, but the consistency is really starting to hurt me. from all these dates - perhaps 100+ at this point? - i've really enjoyed 5 or 6 people, and each and every one told me this after a while. and i know it's part of the game, i know there is nothing wrong with it, i know i felt the same on my side with other dates, but damn, when you hear it repeatedly it just slowly destroys any self-esteem one can have",0

post_00649,"bf called me fat while having sex with me. f/27 m/29
so. i've been dating this guy for 9 months now. he's taken care of me when i was sick, traveled hours when we were long distance and was extremely sweet, caring and compassionate. 
but there's been an issue playing on my mind since the day it happened 3 months ago and i just can't shake it. 
we were having sex he grabs me and says he would really like to be able to lift me up over his shoulders and pick me up to f*ck and if i just lost weight and became more curvy, id be so sexy. mind you he's saying this to me mid pump looking me dead in my eyes. i just freeze. not even sure what to say. 


i promptly tell him to get the fuck off me. and we don't talk for a few weeks or have sex again for a while. he tells he only wants to be with me, but i could be better. 

during this time he continuously pursues me. telling me i'm all he wants etc etc. but i feel like the level of trust dissipated. 

for reference i'm 5'5 190ish, more muscular / hourglass. im a mixed girl, and carry the weight evenly, i'm definitely thick, but i've always been okay with that. 

am i overreacting to get upset about this from time to time. even though he's apologized, i just can't shake the feeling that he wants better and is settling.

edit: i'm not asking for unwarranted diet advice, just because you believe you're fitter and healthier is great & i'm happy for you, but could really care less.  this post isn't made for you to feel better about your self esteem / bodies on my expense. find healing ❤️‍🩹

edit: i'm doing my best to reply to all comments! thank you all so much for your responses. and to the wanna be gym bros & pick me girls, no one gives a fuck but i'm glad i gave you a chance to be internet warriors to vent your frustrations. now 4,000 people know you can't lift 200 pounds but talk about working out? sus 😂

edit: i'm doing my best to reply to people.  but thank you all so much for your comments! 💗💗💗💗 i appreciate your points of view and words of encouragement. and to the trolls i wish you healing as it takes a sad and sick person to be calling someone fat especially when you haven't seen my body and don't know my health records, such weird and ugly behavior, i hope your mental health and body image gets better day by day. there's so much more to life than being fake dietitians on reddit & as fit as you make think you are your disgusting  personalities still don't take away from your perfect  ""physiques"" you all claim to have . never forget you can always experience weight gain through health issues and or mental issues so if all you have to offer is your body you're going to be one lonely person, karma is real & internet trolling is so ugly 💗

edit: i'm having many people threatening my life in my messages over being fat…. are you guys ok?! seriously the effort being put into someone you don't even know is scary. just because i rejected your diet advice… people are really that disturbed.. good lord. i'll be reporting any of those comments / messages cause that shi is overboard now.",1

post_00655,"to no one and to all i know. i may be too scared to die, but.. everything's just crumbling. i feel so lifeless. it feels like my body has energy, yet i have little to no motivation.

my parents are narcissists, that can't change even in the slightest for their daughter. i'm taking years to get better myself and i've finally reached a place of confidence and analysis that prevents breakdowns.

the only person i can call a friend is not replying to messages that will either make or break the friendship, which is okay, but it also breaks me. waiting is hard. yet he's been so not trustworthy recently.. it feels like he doesn't care. he doesn't really check in on me, even though i'm going through a really rough time. he doesn't plan things with me and initiate those things. he sometimes ignores my messages after asking how i am.. and we talked about how hurtful these things are.. yet, well, we are here. i just need to wait. maybe he's planning to find a replacement or strength to tell me to fuck off.

me and my partner are constantly having issues, we are so so close to breaking up. at times it feels wonderful, during others it feels like breaking up is inevitable. i often fall into idealization and devaluing because he doesn't meet my needs. it hurts. all of it. he is also not very emotionally ""advanced"". he has only started his healing journey. he's suicidal and depressive. i've been in this healing journey for 7-9 years now. we don't match on that. he has so much to learn.. but it's been a year and i feel hopeless on this subject. again, waiting.

waiting is so tiring. it's so stressful.

then there's uni. my uni acts like it's very individualized and cares about mental health. well, that's wrong. they don't care, they're a big institution that care about being advertised as caring, but not really being. and i have 1,5 years of that left. it feels like school all over again. i am so tired of memorizing.. it's so useless. exams and midterms basically only test memory. i am just so tired.. again - waiting. waiting for uni to end.

and then we have the future. the amount of uncertainty, the amount of possible loneliness, the amount of stress and work and bullshit that might or might not happen, or the fact i will need to work my whole life.. all of it is torturous.

not a single thing in my life feels stable. i don't want to be alive, but since i developed an insane fear of death, i am left with hopelessness, living by distractions. there's nothing to rationalize anymore, nothing to analyze. i just want one singular person to be stable and safe. just one. i'm tired of being by myself, i'm tiring of being able to cry mostly only when i'm alone. i'm just tired. i'm tired. waiting.",1

post_00670,"suicide is inevitable for me i've been suicidal from a very young age, so i can't really relate to anyone else now. i don't understand how anyone functions and lives their life without killing themselves. it's difficult for me to even imagine.

having attempted it once, it didn't make me want to die any less, either. i just feel bad that i failed. i was a coward and didn't push through the fear of pain to let it end me. i'm not afraid to die, but it feels so different when you try. every time i think back to that day, i wish that i died. it makes me realize that all the time i spent being alive since then has been worthless. i'm wasting time putting off the inevitable.

i can't stop myself from wanting to die. that feeling never goes away, so how could i handle having to live with it any longer? i know i'm supposed to just bear it, but i really can't handle it... i feel so alone. i had to endure it all my life on my own, and i really tried my best. i tried to help myself and learn how to live with it, but i just can't. i don't have anyone else to blame but myself, i'm not sure what's wrong with me. i tried getting professionally assessed once, but after being dismissed by the doctors and family alike, i don't want to try again. i don't want help. i don't believe anything could fix me. 

i hope i could be understood that i won't be doing it just because i'm selfish. i tried my best to act normal and shield others from having to deal with these things. i'm not trying to make anyone's life difficult. i know that it's uncomfortable and hard to be around someone suicidal. 
i know it's pathetic, but at my worst moments i simply fantasize about people i like holding or comforting me to make myself feel better. i wish i could know what it feels like before i die, but i'm fine with it remaining a fantasy. it's easier to deal with those things alone, too. i'm used to it, and i know how.

i have a plan. the only thing that has been stopping me is not having a private space to execute it without being noticed. now i'm about to move out to live on my own, and i really think i won't make it to the end of this year. but that does make me happy. i'm glad i'll finally die after so long. i really am.",1

post_00673,"porn addiction has made me suicidal. i've been addicted to pornography ever since i was nine years old. every single fucking day, ever since i was a kid, i've been watching this filth for hours on end. i've had periods in my life where i've tried my very best to curb this addiction and get better, but everytime i make the slightest progress, i fall back into it, even worse than i was before.

i neglect my responsibilities. i don't do things that i have a deadline for, because i'm busy watching porn. i don't talk to my friends or family that much, because i'm busy watching porn. i don't workout anywhere near as much as i used to, because i'm busy watching porn. i don't do the things that i used to love doing, because i'm busy watching porn.

my fetishes get steadily more and more depraved. when i was a kid, i used to watch softcore, vanilla stuff. now, i watch things that i legitimately cannot say. it makes me hate myself so fucking much. whenever i finish, i feel like driving a knife in my aorta, or slitting my throat.

the absolute worst part of it all is that nobody believes this is a real addiction. tell a person that you're addicted to alcohol, and they'll believe you. you have a heroin addiction? oh, you poor soul! we can help you with that. but if you say: ""i have a porn addiction"", people'll tell you that it isn't real. sure. it's not real. i want to kill myself for no fucking reason.

post_00687,"i survived and i can be happy. a month ago i cut my wrist and tried to end my life. it didnt work. these past few weeks ive been feeling better and sometimes i even feel hopeful

a while ago i met someone i had been working with. i had thought we became friends. i really valued this friendship. i felt they were leading me on and gave them a few weeks to stop. they didnt so i decided to talk to them privately not thinking it was that big of a deal. they lied to me about it. it wasnt a big deal but lying made it so much worse. honesty is a big thing for me. so i stopped talking to them for a couple days but got over it. we had another talk about the subject and after they hated me and i dont know why

i was sad at first because i thought we were friends and it hurt me. eventually i decided i no longer wanted to speak to this person because they were treating me horribly. they started being hostile towards me, spreading lies about me and doing everything they can to hurt me. this really did hurt me. i thought this person was my friend and they started acting this way towards me out of no where and i didnt understand and it made me think there was something wrong with me

this situation brought my mental health to a very bad point. this person was aware i struggled with mental health and continued acting this way towards me. i honestly believe they really wanted to hurt me as much as they could. i started hurting myself again for the first time in years, the whole situation made me really sad.

i tried ignoring it, i tried doing things like an employee of the month in order to repair the issue but nothing worked and this person wouldnt stop. they started getting their friends to act hostile towards me as well and i continued trying to be helpful and nice even though i was hurting so much inside. eventually i had to make a complaint hoping this would finally make them stop

they stopped for a month but eventually continued. i hated making that complaint but didnt know what else to do. ive never worked somewhere like this before with people like that before. eventually i had to quit my job knowing i didnt have the money to support myself. after i was hurt and bothered by the situation but every day it was going away, it would just take time.
 
i tried to stand up for myself. they spread lies about me saying im dangerous. i would never hurt someone. any of my friends, coworkers would never think of me that way. she said this knowing it wasnt true. ive ran into multiple people working there since then and none of them were scared of me. these lies destroyed me. kindness is the most important thing to me, i care so much about helping others and being kind and this person lied and said i was dangerous and it broke me.

i begged them not to do it, i told them it would destroy me and my life but they did it anyways. afterwards i fell into a spiral and started hurting myself more and more. the pain was so much. everything i had worked for had been taken away, it hurt so much. i thought about killing myself everyday but it was terrifying. eventually i cut my wrist but it didnt work. ive done it multiple times since then. ive cried to please be able to wake up from this nightmare, all ive wanted is to be happy again. i made videos hurting myself, im embarrassed but i understand that the depression overwhelmed me and the pain was too much. most people dont understand how much depression can hurt

ive been doing better these past few weeks. ive been lucky to now be surrounded by good people. spirit, scooters and now justlove. these people here are good people and they really really like me. everyone there really likes me and thinks im a good person and tells me thing like bryson it is such a pleasure working with you, normally i get anxiety around people but for someone reason i feel comfortable around you, sorry if i seem mean, i feel really comfortable around you and act mean to people i like, they really like me and all these things they say make me so happy

i worked there at that place for so long surrounded by those horrible people that they convinced me that there was something wrong with me and i believed it. now that ive been surrounded by good people and all these places and now that i can stop and remind myself that ive been surrounded by good people in the past too, now i know that i was unlucky. i was unlucky to work at a place like that. i could have worked any where else and id still be happy now, i know that

most people are good. most people like me and think im good. i know im a good person. those people were horrible. they were the mean, inconsiderate, self centered, and most horrible people i have ever met. all of them. ive worked places where you have a bad apple but somehow all the most horrible people in this town gathered in that one place and they were so horrible to be around. they only cared about themselves and they couldnt see how horrible they were so they treated me like i was crazy and made me believe it but i stood out there because im good surrounded by evil. i dont stand out at scooters or just love because the people there are good

i dont understand how people can be so evil, so mean. i wish i wouldve worked anywhere else. i wish i never met those people. im happy that im no longer surrounded by them and i have good people around me who help me, care about me, are kind to me and who are good. that girl, i tried to be her friend and i was hurt that she acted that way, her continuing to act that way really really hurt me and her acting that way for months was too much, and then even after she continued and it destroyed me and i spiraled and hurt myself again and again and the pain the pain was so much i couldnt handle it

but i survived. and sometimes i feel hopeful. and im starting to think i can be happy again. the people around me really like me and that makes me so happy and theyre kind. ive realized how big of an impact the people i surround myself with can have on me. those people gas lighted me and convinced me there was something wrong with me but i know now thats not true. i know now they were bad people. they were mean and cruel and the most horrible people i have ever met in my entire life and they grouped up and it was too much. but now im free from that

i survived and i think i can be happy again. i think i can be happy like before. i hope i never see any of those people again. i hope one day they understand just how much they hurt me and i hope they never treat anyone else this way again. i wish this never happened to me. this pain, this experience, it broke me. i barely survived. ive lost so much these past 6 months because of their lies and hate. ill never understand that hate. i couldve never hated them the same way. i dont understand it. but i dont have to. but i wish i worked anywhere else because i moved here to do something with my life, to be happy, and i was happy so happy coming to columbia but i was unfortunate to be surrounded by those people, they ruined this new experience for me and almost broke me with their hate but i survived and i think i can be happy again

i barely survived, their hate hurt me, really hurt me. but i think i can be happy again. i feel free from all of this, from them, and i think i can be happy again. i hope i dont ever feel this way again and i dont ever hurt myself again",1

 i plan to end my own life.

 i have no time or date set yet but i know it is inevitable. and i know my death with be a relief to every person i have ever loved or cared for as my existence has been whittled down to just receiving and giving pain. they will sigh and thank me for relieving them of the burden of having me in their life. the burden lifted off their shoulders.

i truly ask,  what is the point of living in this cruel and heartless world any more?

 all i do is suffer and cause pain to anyone that comes into my life. i can't work or provide for myself. i am an emotional wreck and a dried up and useless husk of a person. i have lost the will to try, and i'm so tired of begging for help with no relief.

i'm 34 years old with no family, friends, education, job, house or car.  i don't have and can't afford to have kids.  i have no ambition, and no way to improve myself or my life. i'm stuck. my existence now is only meant to serve others. i get taken advantage of, used, manipulated and lied to. and the men in my life only want to use my body for their sexual gratification. i have no soul and they don't care about my well-being or happiness. just what i can offer them.

i have nothing to fight for and i'm tired of wanting to be happy, aching to belong and to be understood and loved only to be abused and abandoned. 

what really solidified this choice is the people i love and care about most, they have shown me how little importance my life really has because they walked away no longer caring if i live or die. showing me such coldness and neglect.  for god sake, my own abusive, belittling and demeaning family has even turned their back on me.

it's just too much.  too painful. i cannot handle another 60 years of this half life, scared to leave my home, scared to talk to anyone because i'd just recieve pain and rejection. i'm scolded for feeling emotions, i'm scolded for loving others and wanting to be loved. i can't do or say anything right. i'm always doing something 'abusive' or 'unhealthy' with no one in my corner supporting me or encouraging me.

i truly believe i have been cursed to walk this earth alone. and i'm not willing to do that.

it's been 34 years of misery, child abuse, neglect,  rejection, pain and embarrasment. and no amount of hospital visits, therapy sessions or medications can ever 'fix' or 'fill' this enormous void i feel inside myself. that in fact, i have always felt.  i've run out of patience, time or care.

i want peace. i want this unbareble pain to stop. i want the nightmares and ptsd memories to stop. and i want to be able to choose when and how i go out.

not only did my initial plans get ruined because of all this, but this was the worse crisis intervention worker i've met so far. these people always think mid-episode is the best time to invalidate your feelings and experiences. he told me flat out that my trauma was ""just events,"" reduced my depression to bullying in middle school (this was the only type of trauma he asked about,) and gave the usual ""you don't know what life has to offer"" speech. not a single thing of substance came out of his mouth. i told everyone that being in the hospital or involved with an outside team would make my depression worse, and what do you know, it did! it's almost like i actually *do* know myself and my life better than other people. who could have guessed?

post_00704,"i want to ""fail"" a suicide attempt so i can ultimately get help  i want to hurt myself in a way that seems like a suicide attempt but won't kill me or give me long lasting effects (like brain damage) so i can get the help i need.

i truly am considering the act of suicide but i want to try getting help, however the hospital i go to doesn't take patients with suicidal thoughts seriously unless they're actually hurt. 

additionally, i also want attention. i can't believe i'm even admitting it, but i feel like everyone in my life thinks i'm ""just saying it"" and that i'm never gonna get the balls to do anything. 

i know how incredibly selfish that is of me but i'm tired of having everyone assume that i'm fine and that i'll get over what i'm struggling with because i've been struggling for years and i'm exhausted.

i don't have any options and i'm going to find a way regardless, this is just one of my last resorts. i don't have any more to give 

so, i ask if anyone knows ways that will seem like an attempt but not kill me. i'm too much of a coward to take pills because i'm anxious of the potential brain damage, but if there's some sort of dosage of something that will make me pass out or something that could pass as an attempt i would appreciate it.

post_00708,"i just survived a suicide attempt. and i just felt like i needed to say that to someone. (nsfw) i actually went through with it. i chugged half a bottle of scotch and swallowed down a bottle of hydrocodone acetaminophen. it had been expired for 6 months- and though i kept it in a cool dry place since getting my wisdom teeth taken out, it must have gone bad because i'm still here. waking up from that was so disappointing. i'm still here- alive- and i seriously don't want to be. but that's life ha. 

anyway i can't tell anyone about it. felt sick for hours and hours afterwards and just dealt with it alone. tried to call a friend but they ghosted. now what. people always tell me ""oh you've been through so much you're so strong you're so resilient"" i'm not trying to be resilient anymore i'm tired. i guess i'm either stupid enough to take bad pills or resilient enough to not die haha. i'll just have to figure out what i'm supposed to do with my life now.

post_00710,"why tf did i do this yesterday my teacher, one of those i trust and admire, asked me if everything's alright. he's asked me that before, where i just shrugged it off, but this time i just broke done. i told him everything about my situation at home, which i think is neglectful, leaving out my sh behavior and suicidal thoughts (just the day before i attempted, which made me so much more emotional)

now i feel so fucking stupid for telling him, i feel shame, cause the things i was talking about were so fucking more dramatic than they are and really fucking embarrassing, i feel so incredibly guilty for making him waste his fucking time on me, even though i feel like those aren't ,,real"" problems i'm facing, i'm not facing any physical abuse or extreme forms, and i feel like such a fucking burden for putting this onto him. he told me he doesn't really know what to do, and to get more insight on my case he will talk anonymously to professional for help, and i feel so guilty for putting this pressure onto him.
and i feel fucking violated. idk, i've never talked to anyone about my problems, if i do i get these crazy panic reactions, which i also had when i talked to him. i feel violated talking about my feelings, issues, thoughts, feel like there's something genuinely wrong with me and now he knows. now he knows how fucking pathetic i am. i feel so fucking violated, i've never had anyone listen to me like he did, but i don't know if i liked it, i felt so incredibly transparent, and it's scary to know someone got to hear about some of my most inner thoughts and worries.

idk, i kinda regret talking to him, i don't know if it was a good idea. it does keep me from attempting anytime soon, i promised him to talk about the situation again the next days, but what i'm feeling right now is so fucking intense and it makes me short circuit every time i think about it.

was that the right thing to do? i feel like i shouldnt have done that, or at least not talk to him, my teacher, about this. but then, i don't think i trust anyone enough to talk about it.",1

post_00727,"i made a terrifying discovery (venting). hello reddit,

so i have suicidal thoughts. way too often and it's getting worse. it recently led me to try the national 24/7 suicide hotline in my country. i would say out of curiosity because i'm not ready to end myself from fear of failing to do so. and what a ride it's been.
it doesn't even properly ring before you get a recorded answer. it says that nobody can answer and they hope to hear from you soon if you try to call later. of course, later is never late enough. i tried several times until i skipped to what they advise doing if you can't wait for help : calling emergencies.
at this point i'm pondering what i am doing because emergencies is not what i need and their purpose is to help people in danger, not listening to john doe's existential crisis but here i go.
the dude's reaction once i explained the situation is exactly ""what am i supposed to do ?"" in an obviously irritated and not-my-problem kind of tone. understandable, not your job good sir. after a brief exchange and i've apologised for wasting his time best used for something more important, he at least gives me another phone number to call.
this one rings, great. then i get the inavoidable ""can't take your call now"" record. from what i understand it's a 24/7 hotline for lonely people in need of a talk.
back to suicide hotline because there's no more backup plan, still not later enough.
i had to confess all this to somebody because of my inability to hide how far down i got anymore. i called the suicide hotline in front of this person without hesitation knowing full well nobody will ever answer and so the guy gets to hear the abomination of a message they deliver.
so i came to a conclusion. had i been on the verge of ending it all when calling, this would have dealt the final blows (because it's been several blows to me) and i'd have crossed the line for good. how many people might have experienced just that and felt even more desperate and lonely when they were already at rock bottom ? has this hotline killed more people than they helped ?
so if you're alone and in critical need of help in my country, well i salute you and hope you'll rest in peace. because nobody gives a damn fuck.",1

post_00761,"struggling to find hope lately, it feels like the weight of the world is crushing me. i wake up every morning with a heaviness in my chest that never seems to go away. the thoughts of ending it all have been lingering in my mind, whispering that maybe it's the only way out of this endless darkness. i've tried reaching out to friends and family, but no one seems to understand the depth of my pain. loneliness has become my constant companion, and the idea of facing another day feels unbearable.  i'm drowning in a sea of despair, and i can't see a way out. every day is a battle to just keep breathing, to keep going through the motions when all i want to do is give up. the future looks bleak, and the past is filled with regrets and sorrows that haunt me in the silence of the night.  i don't know how much longer i can hold on. the thought of relief that comes with the idea of ending it all is tempting, but a part of me still holds onto a flicker of hope that maybe, just maybe, things can get better. but right now, in this moment, it feels like that hope is slipping through my fingers. i'm lost, i'm broken, and i don't know how to find my way back.",1

academically, she is brilliant. aced her college but when it comes to life , i just don't know. we always have the same discussions over and over again. when it comes to kids. when it comes to money. when it comes to bills. when it comes to everything. it's like her parents wired her to think that post marriage , the husband takes care of everything you just gotta sit back and produce babies. 

our second child was an accident. although i wanted to terminate, her sad face and all of our parents made me reconsider , rethink. i thought may be having two kids will make both of us more responsible and more proactive. but no it's that i am on double duty and she is the same. i am just fucking tired. to top it off, i lost my job last month.

i do not know where i am heading with this life i am just all round angry and unhappy. i feel sad when i look at my kid's faces. i wish i could do better. i wish i had a proper support system. in a crowd of my family , i just feel so alone.

sorry i am all over the place. my thoughts are jumbled. any advice to navigate is welcome. no hating on my wife please

post_00795,"im terrified of being a girl.. im a 14 year old girl whos weaker than average, im thin and short.
i hate being a girl so much. more than anything. if one day i had proof of reincarnation, id kill myself and hope i come back as a boy.
im scared of men, im scared because men are stronger. i hate that men are stronger. its the most humiliating thing. i hate being built for childbirth, i hate having a bigger chest and wider hips. its embarrassing. i want more than anything to be a boy. 
i look really feminine too, and i hate it so much. im seriously thinking about just ending it all.
i wish i was a boy so that i would be stronger, but also because i want to look like a boy and be treated like a boy and perceived like a boy. being a teenage girl in this disgusting, misogynistic world is the most demeaning and humiliating thing ever. knowing that im living off of peoples mercy.
i even have fantasies where im a boy and i look like a boy and i do things that i see my brother and father doing. in an ideal world, id be a man who loves and protects girls just like me so that they wont have to feel this way. i want to fight and be strong, and everyone, including biologists, tell me ill never even compete to men, so i dont even try. i dont exercise, i dont do anything. im severely depressed and anxious. im completely paranoid of the people around me, especially men. and its not just that, its that i want to be a man just because i do. i want facial hair and a deep voice and thicker eyebrows and an adams apple. im just so tired of this. i think im just going to end it all, because i cant be a boy. ive gone through thinking about transitioning, but the world is so cruel and hateful towards trans people and im scared. the place im in has anti trans laws too. so i cant be trans for my own safety. im just stuck being a girl. so its two choices:
be a girl or die.

edit:
guys im sorry for gender stereotyping.
there isnt an excuse for my behaviour.
im sorry to all the people who ive offended and im sorry for undermining transmen issues and trying to include myself in them when i dont belong in that space. i feel like i was being overly dramatic this entire time and im sorry to everyone who ive caused worry to. just because im sad does not mean i have the right to dump that on other people. im sorry everyone.
to everyone telling me to just go to a therapist or a professional, youre right. it wasnt right for me to throw my problems at a bunch of strangers.
ill call a helpline instead. thank you for all the help and support.

edit again:
upon looking at these comments, ive come to the conclusion that being a guy sucks too. being a girl also sucks. being nonbinary also sucks. people will continue to hate me for the rest of my life no matter what i do. based on my gender, but also my race. so i think i am going to kill myself.
i think in reality, i just hate being human, being a person. i hate existing. maybe this didnt have much to do with gender at all. i think maybe i just hate myself and everything else. i dont want to be a girl, i dont have to be a boy, i dont want to be anything. the only thing i genuinely want to be is something disgusting. something people wont come near or bother. like a corpse, or a vampire, or a maggot. i dont like myself and im coming to realize i dont like many people either. i really appreciate all your guys help and advice though.

edit again again: please stop using she/her for me. i understand that its confusing because i referred to myself as a girl here, but i feel like i keep commenting and telling people and they dont seem to listen? maybe im looking too deep into it. but please dont. thank you.

edit again again again: guys can we please stop being so hostile to each other? i didnt mean for this post to have dozens of angry arguments and profanity under it.

edit for the millionth time:
at first, when i posted this, i was just very depressed and upset. now im angry.
i posted this to a suicide subreddit looks for support, advice, conversation, or just a listening ear. but for some reason people are arguing with each other, being transphobic, calling other people names and even slurs?? not to mention the amount of transphobic people trying to defend me against the trans agenda when i do not need defending of any sort, because i dont want it. im fine. this was a post about how im experiencing a difficult time, not an invitation to harass others and deliberately speak over me and try to talk for me. can we please just stop swearing at each other and attacking each other? this is honestly making me lose hope is society even further.

edit again: guys stop talking about me getting pregnant. its really uncomfortable. i made this post to look for help and support. instead i have lost faith in people and im honestly feeling worse. im 14, dont pull that oh but you might change your mind later because i dont care. there are more reasons to me not being able to have a child that you guys dont know about. i didnt even mention pregnancy in this. i really wish people would stop bringing it up. i literally cannot be a mother, im too unstable and i cant handle noise. im scared of children and im severely germaphobic. there are more reasons that i dont want to list because this post is not about me getting pregnant! stop. please stop assuming you know me better than i know myself. i really really dont appreciate it. so stop.

edit: i hate it here. i really thought that going on a suicide support subreddit would help me.
i know i said to be respectful and stop using profanity but fuck you guys. not all of you guys, some of you are really sweet. but really. ive officially lost faith in the internet, strangers, and human nature. for some reason someone was talking about how being a woman is an opportunity for me to be a stripper??? what the fuck??? im 14, thats literally the first line of this post. but i can thank you all for something, thank you for reminding me why parents sometimes say stranger danger because you guys are seriously pushing me closer to just ending it allfor an entirely different reason. now i just want to kill myself because i hate the world and myself. so thank you for that. i really appreciate it. and also, i know people have it worse than me, okay? i dont need a reminder 10x a fucking hour. im just so sick of this shit and im sick of people in general. i really hoped that this would be a nice supportive subreddit where people could maybe give me advice, and they did! but like half of the people here are literally just subtly encouraging me.",1

honestly im shocked. latley my suicidal thoughts have been worsening and ive started slowly having attempts to overdose. in fact last night i took so many pills im honestly shocked im still alive. i spent 2 hours just trying to help people, im thankful i found this sub. i guess im just venting here and saying everything im feeling so i can understand it better. it reminds me to allow myself to see that people really do love me and that im not a bad person. ive always been different, despite being bullied for it my entire life just about, i never let it take away who i was because that was all i had. i always say that no matter what you do and what you change about yourself, there will always be people who find things to pick apart. its better to be who you are and have people dislike you, than to be a person youre not and have people still dislike you. im sorry i know this is very long. honestly the only thing keeping me from killing myself is my partner, and my job. my partner is struggling with medical issues and despite all our attempts to get help, we still can hardly afford his treatment. he is in pain and he told me two days ago that he is suffering. that destroyed me. he is the love of my life and gave me a reason to live again. the idea of getting married, having kids having a family, getting old together, makes me fight to make it to the next day. but its not easy, it breaks my heart and i know that if there is ever a time where its clear he will die, i will kill muself because i cannot bear to feel that agony. yes it may sound horrible and selfish but its just too much. i work in childcare, i am the teacher for preschool and twos. it makes me so happy, coming into work and seeing all the kids so ecstatic to see me, yelling my name running up to me for a hug, we missed you we missed you ive always been good with kids. yeah my job is hard but its rewarding. having parents tell me that they are so greatful for me and what i do, and hearing that the kids always talk about me, makes me feel so fulfilled. and because of that i always beat myself up for wanting to kill muself because my life isnt all bad, and that makes me want to kill myself. i feel so frustrated and upset. ive again been on a lot of medication since i was 10. my depression is difficult because my brain is not properly able to produce serotonin normally, you can actually kinda see on a brain scan. i feel like i shouldnt be alive because if it wasnt for my medication i would be unable to survive. i think my attempts at od are affecting my heart because every time it causes me to have chest pain, irregular heartbeat, and just a very unwell feeling. my parents are starting to notice it. i might ask for them to keep my medication out of access, but im scared of them having me go to a psych ward. being autistic makes it so hard to do that because i just cant survive in that environment, i was so unhappy and depressed when i was there when i was young. it honestly traumatized me. again im sorry this is so long. i just hate the feeling of feeling like i have no right to be sad because other people have it so much worse, and i feel frustration that no matter how hard i try i cant love myself and i am often unable to see and believe that people want me to stay alive. ive never meant to hurt anyone but sometimes i feel like theyd all i do. i really dont know whats going to happen to me. ive slowly been eating less and less, or binging on favorite food. i hardly leave my room and the only reason i dont lay in bed all day miserable is because of my job. anyways im sorry this is so long. i hope someone will read this and be sble to understand me because thats all i want, i want to be understood.",1

post_00808,"maybe it's time. i'm not even gonna bother making a throwaway account. 
i think it's time i go to my spot and shoot myself in the head. 

i'm 25 years old, i know i'm young but i've already endured so much pain i don't know how much more i can take. i lost my brother to suicide by train when i was 6 years old.and right after my 22nd birthday my father shot himself in the head with his revolver. about 6 months later, my uncle shot himself in the head. 

i hate myself, i really, really do. the world had turned me into such a bitter person and even at work ( i'm an armed security guard i catch myself constantly thinking about suicide. i concealed carry as well so in a way it's comforting knowing i have the button to end it at any time.

literally the only thing stopping me is my boyfriend (22ftm)  that i love with every fiber of my being. i really, really don't want to hurt him. this would crush him and he would never recover and i could never forgive myself for it. 
 
every day is a battle for me at this point and i'm constantly hearing this voice in my head that says ""he killed himself,"" as if it's talking about me in the third person. it's my voice, but i hate it. i already hate the sound of my own voice and i don't feel like i fit in anywhere. i'm sorry for ranting, i just don't like life right now and i'm not sure i want to partake in it anymore.

post_00809,"the act of taking my own life is not something i am doing without a lot of thought. i do not fear death, i fear life, i need to stop it. 

when i do sleep, my dreams are haunted. they do not let me think. for nearly three years i dealt with being told i am not enough, that i am ugly, to go die and finally the last thing you said was ""fuck you"" after i wanted the truth of why you had that girl in the background. she's even on your steam account. i have wondered if you have her on tumblr too, and other online entities. worst part is, i know there's more. you didn't care about telling the truth, you pretended you had no idea who i was talking about, you played dumb. you acted like you did nothing at that party with anyone, but you were vague and didn't keep your word about remaining in contact with me. 

i know ive only been a burden because i am in the way of your desire to cheat and have sex with as many people as possible. even after i told you that you were the only one for me, after i tried to express my feelings and love for you, you still wanted all the people in your phone. this time, you can have them and i wont be sad. this is my chance to be selfless like you wanted, to give you to other people. the only way i can do that is to be numb. 

i tried acting like everything will be fine. i know deep inside that it's not, and never will be.

to my mom, i love you, this is not your fault, and i know my child hood has impacted me as an adult. i'm sorry for not cutting him off sooner, and realizing he doesn't love me like you said. i cant pretend anymore, no more fake smiles from me. don't hold this against yourself, you did nothing wrong, i am weak and i need peace. 

to my brother, my childhood friend and someone who has supported me. it was never about you. i love you, don't take this too hard. just know that i am happy and i am not suffering anymore.

to my sisters: i am distant from you, but we were very close when i was younger. not one of you had the time to ever visit but you had the time to travel a lot. i however am a decade younger than you so i couldn't afford to go out to visit. i was going to write something else in regard to you never visiting, instead i want you to know i love you and i hope you lead fulfilling lives. 

to the father of my children, i love you very much like family. even though we didn't work out i hope you live your life without any regrets. you are worthy of a good woman, and i know you will meet her one day. love her and love her hard. make sure she is someone that loves our kids. 

to the people who believed in me, there is nothing you could have done to distract me from my grief, from my broken heart. no words can fix this, don't worry about not seeing the signs because there weren't any. when someone you love so deeply says and does things that break you there is no comfort that any one can give you, not even from myself. 

god, i am so sorry, please forgive me.

i don't care much for things that i can't take with me when i die, i only wanted what could fulfil my soul.

post_00813,"just feeling guilty. just came across a call recording of my ex bestfriend(m) whom i(f) had a crush on . our friendship got fucked up when another girl(call her a) jumped in the scenario. i didn't know much about her but i started being friends with her with my other friend(call her b) so then shit got messed up more and more . 
the a girl started dating my crush even after being aware that i liked him.  she just came and within 2 weeks he was hers. i got so stressed that i got sick. she made fun of it and said that i was faking it . she was always negative to me that i am flat and dark skinned while comparing herself to me and telling that she is better and ending it by saying it's just a joke. 
soon after they started dating i cut off contact with my crush because she was a bit jealous types but she wouldn't show it. and apparently he got very emotional and cried and stuff . so after that him and i rarely spoke . 
after some weeks their relationship started fluctuating. they used to take breaks and stuff . and whenever they used to take breaks he used to contact me saying i'm lonely and all . which obv i felt used . so one day that girl said smtg to me and she didn't clarify it which i should've maybe kept it with me .
 and soon after 1 or 2 months my friendship with a also started going downhill . soon i ended friendship with a . meanwhile me and b became close and we are still besties . after a was gone b told me about the things a used to say. i was hurt . but i let it go . and a's exes told me stories about her(which was basically her being a cheater), which i tried telling my crush so that he doesn't get hurt . but that day when i told he sort of listened to me and was nice. next day he started behaving rude and said those are all fake stories . i agreed to it and i just backed off .
 so i told this whole story including that unclarified text message . i told around 4 close ppl of mine. one of those close people was her current bestie(call her v) . but during that time v hated a and a hated v too . so while telling it just slipped and i told the whole thing to v . i didn't know v would go and tell everyone about that unclarified text. it spread like a wildfire and i wasn't aware of it. then my crush and a would call and ask why i did that . 
but actually it wasn't me who told anyone . and i would get so overwhelmed i would just avoid talking about it . only me and b knew that it was v but it was too late . i found out that v was the culprit an year after all this happened. i felt guilty about it . this wholeeeee thing has left a deep trauma on me and whenever i see any of them i go numb asf. nobody understands it . and i'm not saying i'm innocent in this whole thing , but i didn't intend to do that too . i didn't want to spread rumours about them but yeah . now i don't want to sort it out with them too . but i sometimes sit and wonder where did it all go wrong . anyways i didn't want a in my life . but that guy atleast as a friend maybe yeah. i wouldn't have dated him but that bond is gone . i was sooo cheerful and bubbly when it was him. when he was gone from my life , i lost myself too . 
now i'm happy in my relationship no doubt . it's not like i miss him in that way but i just miss him as a friend or atleast that he should've just been there if not involved in my life . i just wanted to get it off. any advices would be appreciated too.",1

i've started texting this girl that i asked out and she of course rejected me because i'm a lowlife piece of shit. she always hits me up first and she's the only reason basically i have any hope at all except deep down i know she doesn't give a fuck about me and will never love a useless loser like me

because of the fucking pandemic i don't even have soccer, the only thing that kept me going every week, the only time when i feel myself and can express myself and don't want to fucking kill myself. my best friend has just ghosted me the last few weeks and i'm completely alone, the only person that even texts me is this girl but she won't hang with me and even if she wanted to she couldn't because of the quarantine. 

i'm not gonna make it through 3 more weeks of this i just wish i had a gf who cares about me and would hold me close and tell me it's gonna be ok and i wish i could say this stuff to my friends but i'm a man and i can't show emotion or i look like a pussy, i just want to cuddle with a girl and be warm and happy i'm such a loser idk i just want to be happy again it's been so long




big update: asked her out she said she liked me too but we under quarantine lmao",1

post_00834,"16m, i'm in love with an anime character and i want to die to live with her i'm only 16 years old. i know that i have my entire life in front of me, but i'm tired. tired of feeling lonely. i suffer from social anxiety, but my parents say that it's just because i'm ""a little shy"" and that i ""should go more towards others"". the thing is that it's really hard to talk to anyone. when i get invited go parties, i just sit in a corner and wait. i have friends, and i know i should feel lucky to have them, but i feel like they don't understand me. i can't have a normal conversation with them. i feel like they enjoy more talking to other people than me. i still feel lonely even when i'm around them.

recently, i fell in love with an anime character (ichika nakano, from quintessential quintuplets if you're curious). i imagine her with me when i'm alone, hugging me, comforting me with sweet words, telling me that everything will be fine. i want her to be real, not just a part of my imagination. i want to be able to hug her back.

i feel like i will never meet someone like her in real life. i got rejected 3 times when i was younger, and i know it's entirely my fault, because i'm a wierd guy and i don't know how to handle a proper conversation. i've given up on fiding love one day. the only person in my life now is ichika.

so, maybe, if i die, maybe i will be able to join her in another world, a world where we could live happily together. i know it sounds so fucking stupid. i don't see the point on living on anyways, because i'm never going to find someone like her.

i don't really know why i'm writing this, nobody will read it anyways. also sorry for bad english.

post_00843,"i'm a waste. tonight i was going to do it. in my parents' home. i was going to lay on my bed and bleed out from my wrists and die. 

my mom walked in when i was just lightly scraping my skin to mark where i'd cut later tonight. she said ""i just wanted to see you."" i had to hide my body under the covers so that i could keep her from seeing what i had done to my arm and my body at that point. she came in and laid down on my bed and rest her head on my lap. ""it's comfortable,"" she said. i tried my best to hold back tears. 

she eventually left and now i'm here, staring at my razorblade, wondering why i'm left here as a sympathetic, pitiful loser. all i can imagine is my mom opening the door to my childhood bedroom and seeing my blood-stained mattress with a lifeless sack of organs on top. i can imagine her crying. 

i feel like a waste of money and time. the thousands of dollars that have been pumped into me for the promise of a successful future is too much. the time that people have invested in me for relationships and friendships is too much time that would've been better spent anywhere else. the only time i enjoy is time wasted on videogames and music. i am less than mediocre at both. 

my whole life has been infested with lies and attention whoring. i've lied about my age online so that guys wouldn't be afraid to talk to me. i've created a whole new person that interacts with me and my friend group online just so i can make my other friends jealous. i lie to my friends to manipulate them into doing what i want them to do. as for the attention whoring, i've done enough of it in my early teens. at 14, i was telling men online that i was 18. id send them pictures of myself so that i could get validation. i craved the romantic attention that i never got at that age.

it's now 12am and i'm still here, scoring my thighs and spitting on the wounds. i've taken breaks while typing this and i feel like i'm ready. i just need some validation that i'm not the only one that knows that their life is completely fucked from decisions made by themselves. 

so. speaking of decisions that i made that fucked up my life.
i'm living with 43 scoliosis that gives me severe backpain that (shocker) i have given to myself. i, as the attention whore i was in elementary school, longed for something that would make me different from the other kids at school. i sat in weird postures and slept in strange positions until my spine decided to follow through with my plan. the next scoliosis check that i had, i was told to get checked for scoliosis. lo and behold, now i'm at a 43 curve that requires a long and painful surgery to fix. 
i also fucked with my eyesight as a child so that i could get glasses. now i'm stuck with 7mm thick lenses in my glasses that signify that i'm legally blind to anyone that even sees my glasses. 
i again fucked up my life when i decided to go along with my parents' narrative and pretend to be christian. now i've been working at my church for 6 years. i've also been attending and tithing every week. i'm in the worship band and am currently planning a summer retreat. after 14 years of church, i still don't know what the fuck is going on.

i'm tired of being the second child that is happy and creative and spontaneous and yay!!!!

i'm tired of asking for help and never getting any

i'm tired of lying to people

i'm tired of being a waste of time and money

i'm tired of being completely mediocre

i'm so tired 

it is now 1am and i'm going to do it in 3 hours. 

time to write an unorganized essay for a suicide note.

would it be funny if i wrote it like how highschoolers write their essays? idk

thanks for reading my rambling and my unorganized baby-babble

edit: haha im still here. im still here. im still here.

i spent all night last night trying to write a suicide note, trying to justify myself, trying to excuse myself from living. i wrote a crude one and posted it here before i started the one i meant for my parents and friends. i got three pages in and i fell asleep from exhausting myself mentally and physically. a dark, dreamless sleep that has left me contemplating this morning. i look down at my thighs and my wrists and wonder if dying is really what i want. i read the beginning of my note and pity the author. my sheets are bloody from my thighs and i know my mom can already only handle the smallest bit of blood before going queasy. 

am i going insane? i cant follow through on anything, and now i cant follow through on my own suicide attempt. i had it all planned out and scheduled so that i could finally have something that i scheduled correctly. now im 5 hours late to my own death.

i read the comments in this post and i've spent the past 5 minutes trying to figure out a way to tell you i'm still here. i cant tell if what you all have said is something i should be grateful for or if i should despise you. i guess my answer will come in time.

post_00864,"i'm done trying to get better my whole life i've been trying and trying and trying and trying. i've gotten a bachelor's degree from a good school. i've gotten a career i thought would make me ""worthy"" of peoples attention. i've spent more than 10 years with various therapists, i attended retreats, support groups, workshops, tried many different hobbies, etc and etc. and nothing made me feel better. 

i dated a few people who made me feel utterly alone. they didn't actually like me for me but they were just afraid of being alone. i tried really hard to connect with people and form friendships, i was the one always reaching out and being the shoulder to cry on, the support system, yet i was forgotten and abandoned as soon as i needed help. 

my earliest childhood memory is ""oh i don't belong here"" and ever since i've been feeling like a blob in the universe. just floating around aimlessly, not knowing what the fuck to do with myself.

the only person i loved and cherished is gone - my grandma passed away in 2021. a few months after i attempted suicide but i survived. i wish i didn't. i really don't have any energy to keep going anymore. 

i'm going to end my life tonight and hopefully get to another realm. even if it's worse, at least it would be different. ",1

i had cut myself once with a small knife on a keychain, i haven't done it again but i've thought of doing it.

i tried to kill myself but then i saw my cat watching me and decided to wait for her and my rabbit, i didn't want to leave them.

i tried to overdose by taking 14 pills but failed. i panicked and told my brother, he asked my why i did it and told me not to do it again. he told me to drink some water and to try to stay up. the next day i was sick still (i was already sick before that) and slept all day. the reason i slept all day iscuse my dad gave me too much nyquill but when my brother went to talk to my dad he asked if i had told him what i did. my dad said no so he said nvm and tried to leave but my dad stopped him and told him to tell him what happened since it might be whats wrong with me. my brother told him i took 14 pills since i was sad. i heard this all since i was sleep in my dads bed (he works from home) and i've been in and out of conscience. hours later my dad woke me up since he was leaving, he said i needed to wake up since i've been sleep all day and that we're going to granny's so she can help me. when we got to her place and where getting out to car and asked me about what kai said then said if i ever tried that again he'd beat me. a couple days later i was going to my moms so she picked me up. in the car ride she confronted me about it, she said that she tries to comunicate with me and that i need to cominicate with her then proved to threaten to beat me if i ever tired that again. (the reason i tried to kill myself is cause of my mom and school and her never being satisfied with it.) this was a couple months ago.

i still want to kill myself and every day just makes it worse. every time i pick up something sharp i just get these little thoughts in the back of my head that says to stab myself right then and there. those same thoughts tell me to cut my wrist, to slit my throat, to jump off a building, to drown myself. every time i get close to it i get scared. i have animals and a nephew to take care of, i just became friends with and old friend again, in for months i'll be legally aloud to get a job, i have younger siblings and cousins who would be sad if i succeeded, i have an older cousin who'd punch a wall and an older sister who feels responsable for me.

post_00886,"my ex refuses to send me my belongings after years of asking. 
hi everyone, i just need to vent because i feel kind of ridiculous being so emotional and upset about this. i (26 f) was in a relationship with my ex (40 m) a few years ago. back in 2019, i moved from california to arkansas to be with him after dating long distance for a few months. at the time, i was in a rough spot with my family, and he convinced me to move in with him (though he denies ever doing that). in hindsight, we weren't very compatible, and after facing a lot of disrespect from his family—who were racist toward me because i'm mexican—i decided i couldn't take it anymore and moved back to california in 2021.
being young and hopeful, i thought the relationship might still work out, so we kept up with the long-distance thing. before leaving arkansas, i left behind some of my things, including my cow plushie collection, which holds a lot of sentimental value. some of the plushies were given to me by my father, who passed away in 2015, and others were from my grandmother, who passed in 2024.
the last time i saw him was christmas 2021, and i asked him to pack up my stuff and send it to me. he agreed, but ""forgot."" we broke up in march 2022, and since then, i've been asking him to send my things, especially my cows. i don't care about anything else; i just want my plushies. but he keeps saying it's not a priority for him, and it's ""not on his radar.""
i know it's a big ask, but i've offered to pay for shipping, give him extra money, or even come pick them up myself. he says he's not busy, but the response is always the same. i last spoke to him a few days ago about it, and he said it's not a priority and he's not sure if he even has my stuff but that he'll clean out his attic or barn to check.
i'm so frustrated and feel powerless. part of me knows i should just let it go, but i can't seem to. i feel like i'm being strung along, and i'm exhausted from crying and pleading for something that should be simple. it just feels like a power move on his part to keep communication going, and i'm done with him.
i know it might sound ridiculous to be so upset over stuffed animals, but they mean a lot to me. if anyone has advice on how to either get him to send them or how to let go of this, i'd really appreciate it. thank you.

post_00887,"i'm tired of people's shitty advice how tf can be people say that so confidently. it's so ignorant to say that. and i'm so fucking hypocritical cause i'd say the same shit if my friend was ever going through something. is there actually any real advice to say to someone. i'd like to think of myself as a good with words but i can't think of anything to say to myself. all this ""advice"" doesn't work. ""get in the gym"". ""go out with friends"". ""try to meet new people"". "" just try being happy"". at some point that shit is just annoying to read( no one has ever told me this because no one chance i'd tell someone about how much i hate myself). another one is ""just talk to someone"". i've done some research into this because i truly want to be not hate life. but everything everywhere gives out the same bullshit. i'm starting to think maybe there is no cure. maybe this is just how it is. which is really shit. i've hated being me for about 8 years now. i'm only 21. that's over a third of my life and i barely remember life before i started feeling this way, so it feels like it's been my whole life. my main issue is my fear of being judged or disliked. how do i even get that. is that something you're born with. is this cureable. i've seen stuff online about how just have to face it and start doing random things in public but i would literally die. if i ever embarrassed my self in public i'd probably hurt myself. so if facing it isn't really an option, what do i do. another one is overthinking, how tf do i tell my mind to shut up. the most success i've had with that was heavily drinking. that felt good for a while. i'd just get black out drunk and forget who i was. i'd be so confident. i could talk to girls. granted the next day i would hate myself even more and overthink everything i did but it was a method that worked. but then something happened. all of sudden no matter how much i drank sober me was still in control the whole time. so then i turned to getting high and that worked for a little bit aswell. didn't work aswell or for as long but it was a decent way to avoid my thoughts. but that stopped too. maybe an even stronger drug could be the method. one thing i've been thinking about recently is how 
unattractive am i actually. like i know myself. i'm not good looking by any means and i'm pretty short(about 5'8). i'm definitely not in perfect shape. but like am in underestimating how bad i actually am. like i've been on tinder for 3 years and had maybe 5 replies. and i'm pretty sure 1 was a bot, which unironically is the high point of the last couple months of my life. for like a solid week i had a little hope that maybe i could find a girl to like me. that felt pretty good. but everyone i know bar maybe 1 person is very capable of getting women so like am i legitimately just a 1/10. that's pretty shit but like surely my friends would have told me. surely someone would have said something. last time i tried ""just being confident"" and approaching girls i had 3 girls in a row tell me they have no socials at all. that was pretty embarrassing. and like i wasn't being a creep in the way i was approaching them, atleast i think i wasn't. people always say ""they're just people"". so i just try to talk to them like a regular people. i try to start regular conversations with girls but it's like i can tell they don't want to talk to me and that absolutely nothing against them. like i said earlier, whatever issue it is, it's my fault at the end of the day. but it still hurts. it's not like i'm super drunk when i'm trying to talk to girls or i'm bothering them loads. i'll just go up and try to start a conversation. maybe about the music that's being played. maybe about the club. maybe pay them a compliment and try not to be too generic with it. none of it works. i know the club is probably a shit place to try to meet someone but like where else is there. would a bar not just be the same. no way i'd do that in the gym cause that seems invasive. on the street seems creepy. in class seems weird. i don't think the place actually matters and it's more just something wrong with me. i know all this but it still just hurts. and when you've been hurting for as long as you remember it's really hard to keep going. i feel so selfish and self centred saying this but i feel like if i killed myself my brother would be really depressed. and i think he might already be on his way and he's only 12. but he's had a rough school experience. i think he might be a bit neuro divergent. but my family isn't the type to believe in that which sounds stupid as fuck but they just wouldn't want to accept something like that. i see a lot of myself in him which is just an awful feeling and i try to give him advice and let him know i'm there for him. but like i don't believe any of this advice is real anyway so what's the point. maybe it's genetic. i saw something that said you can be more susceptible to mental illness if someone in your family had it so maybe that's the case. i say all this to ask is there any real advice. even if it's an unhealthy way to deal with them. it can be a drug. idrc. as long as it helps",1

i want to be aspirational but every time i get into something new it fades quickly and my brain tells me to quit because i'll most likely kill myself in a matter of years anyway. 

the world seems to be devolving and i feel less connected to people and more annoyed by them by the day. i feel i will die alone and bitter and i'd rather kill myself than have that happen.

sorry for the long post. needed to vent regardless if anyone even sees this. thanks.",1

post_00948,"i killed my girlfriend, and now i want to kill myself..  

before you read my true story, i want you to know that i'm not very good at english, as it's my second language so bare with me if i have made grammatical mistakes or anything, and honestly i really haven't opened up about this incident in my life, until today.

anyway,

this one random late night in march 2017, i decided to download the tinder app (probably the worst decisions in my life) , but i'm genuinely a introvert person, so it's hard for me to make conversation on spot to get to know people. most people hop on tinder to troll, some to get laid but i was on it to find ""true love"". fast forward to two months of most girls wanting to just party or i was to boring to form a conversation, this one random day i got super liked by this girl named laura. we both started to talk, we both had a lot of similarities between us and she was literally 2 miles away from my place. it had been 2 weeks, we both still haven't meet but our conversations started to get more personal, and i felt a real connection between us two. we both replied long, it used to take me a good 45mins to an hour to reply, it was just how it was. it was however odd for me that she was really beautiful, and i was a ugly mf. she came from a small town family, where as me, i was a city kid, from a wealthy family (although she didn't know that for along time).

after the 2 weeks of talking, we both decided to meet up for lunch. like when i say she was simple, she had no idea about brands or anything. i dressed up with some yeezy 750s, she didn't even know them. and some part of me liked that she was like that, because most of the times, i only wore to show off, to feel rich, to feel accepted. one thing about being rich is that, the definition of happiness is so different to what a average person would say. like an average person has aspirations of having a nice house, a nice car, nice gadgets and all but it's different being born wealthy, like i had everything that anyone would aspire of having, it's different when you have everything. anyway that just made me like laura more because she was a simple person, a bit mysterious and i was always curious to know more about her.

we ended up dating for 6 months, and i knew she was the one for me, she was beautiful, she loved me for who i was, i didn't have to pretend to be this cool dude like i did with my friends, she loved the sensitive little bitch i was. everything was going well, till (jan 2018) she called and cried, her father was diagnosed with lung cancer at a bad stage, the doctors said they could cure it but he would only survive for a couple of months. laura was going through some tough times, but i was always with her, trying to make her strong. she would tell me stories about her dad, like how they used to horse ride back when they used to live on farm lands, and how he would work 14 hours everyday just his both daughters could have the life that every other kid had. tbh that got me so depressed, like the fact that her father sacrificed so much for his kids and all. but no matter what had happened over the next few months, years or the next decade or so, i said to myself that i would always be with laura, and i wanted to marry her.

we got back to our casual routines, she was getting better and better, and on her birthday 11th of march, i proposed to her, i honestly didn't know if it was the right time or not, but i felt like i needed to tell her that i'm gonna be committed and not just saying it but i wanted to show her. laura said yes, cried and hugged so hard that i thought she would break my bones, but i knew that this meant a lot to her.

april 11th 2018.

this part is going to be hard for me, as i am typing my fingers are twitching, i'm really scared, because to say it out is something i haven't done... anyway, on this very day, i picked up laura, we were driving to the hospital to visit her dad, we went on the highway. till this high speeding car (prolly doing 150kmph) tried to overtake a vechile in front of us so we were behind this car, but suddenly suddenly the person slammed the brakes and dropped back, causing me to smash into the car. after this moment, i don't remember a thing. it felt like i died, i could hear my surroundings but i couldn't see anything, idk how long or anything i woke up and the first thing i asked was ""what happened to laura?"" and my mum started to cry but i thought she was crying for me. i kept asking, and no one replied. then it hit me, it hit me that she's not alive, and i couldn't understand. it all happened in a flash of a second.. the love of my life was gone, and i could do nothing about it, i didn't know how to take it in, it fucked me up. i only had minor injuries, but i was mentally dead.

fast forward to a month, i still was in shock, infact i still am.. i went to visit her family, to apologies, but couldn't even let out a word, just cried out loud, but somehow they understood my pain. laura's dad seemed to be weaker, her mum always had a smile on but she looked so bad, she was in shock and it just made me feel worse and worse. a week later, i found out that laura's dad had passed away, i wasn't ready for the funeral, i didn't go to laura's too because i couldn't accept it but my mum told me that i had to go to comfort her mum. but laura's mum had completely changed, she didn't want to hear anything from anyone because two of the most people in her life had passed away and i honestly could do nothing but cry looking at her.

fast forward it to now, there hasn't been a day i felt that i could have done better, i could have reacted better, and if i had turned the other way, maybe i could have died instead of laura, maybe she survived she could have been with her dad for the rest of time, maybe seeing her daughter would have kept him alive for a bit longer, maybe the mum would have been brave having her daughter around. i know it's not my fault, i've heard people say that constantly, it's not fault bro"" but i could have done better, to prevent it, and that is stuck in my mind, and always will. i honestly have no hope for life, i just want to die, i can't get over these thoughts, i just hope i die real soon.... it's not that i want sympathy but i just can't deal with it, it hurts.",1

post_00959,"i've been to the bottom. maybe my story can help you climb back up hey reddit,

my first post and most probably last one :) 

i'm not sure where to begin, except to say that i've been… really, *really* down. like, staring-into-the-abyss, wondering-if-there's-anything-worth-fighting-for down. i'm talking about a cocktail of career setbacks that felt like personal betrayals, a social life that crumbled under the weight of my own insecurities, a family dynamic riddled with unspoken pain, and a marriage that, at times, felt like a slow, agonizing death.

i'm not going to sugarcoat it. there were days, weeks, even months where i didn't just stumble; i *fell*. i fell hard, and i stayed down. the weight of it all – the perceived failures, the loneliness, the crushing disappointment – it was suffocating. there were times i genuinely believed that the world would be better off without me. i contemplated ending it all. i won't go into the specifics, but those thoughts were very real, very visceral, and very terrifying.

i know there are probably people reading this right now who understand exactly what i'm talking about. that feeling of being utterly, completely, and hopelessly lost. the feeling that you're drowning, and no one can see you, or worse, they *can* see you, but they don't care enough to throw you a lifeline.

the truth is, i don't have a magic bullet. i don't have some profound secret that will instantly erase your pain. but what i *do* have is the experience of clawing my way back from that darkness. and that experience, i'm willing to share.

what changed? well, it wasn't one single thing, but a gradual shift in perspective. i stumbled upon stoicism. i know, it sounds a bit academic, maybe even a little cliché. but for me, it was a revelation.

before stoicism, i was constantly blaming external factors for my misery. my boss was unfair, my family was dysfunctional, my partner was unsupportive, the world was just *against* me. stoicism taught me that while i can't control what happens *to* me, i *can* control how i react to it.

it wasn't easy. it's a constant work in progress. there are days when i still feel the pull of that old despair, the urge to just give up. but now, i have tools to fight back. i learned to focus on what i *can* control: my thoughts, my actions, my attitude. i started practicing gratitude, even for the smallest things. i started accepting the things i couldn't change, and focusing my energy on changing the things i could. i started understanding that hardship is part of the human experience, and that it can actually make us stronger.

one of the most powerful stoic concepts for me was *amor fati* – love of fate. it's not about passively accepting everything that happens to you, but about embracing it, seeing the potential for growth in even the most difficult situations. it's about recognizing that everything, even suffering, has a purpose.

i started small. i started meditating, even just for five minutes a day. i started journaling, writing down my thoughts and feelings, trying to understand them without judgment. i started exercising, even just going for a walk in nature. these seemingly small actions, repeated consistently, started to make a real difference.

i still struggle. i still have bad days. but i no longer feel like i'm drowning. i feel like i'm swimming, sometimes against the current, but swimming nonetheless.

and that's why i started a youtube channel. it's called worldshapershub - i know, it's just a small thing, but it's my way of trying to pay it forward. i share my story, my struggles, and the stoic principles that have helped me. i talk about mental health, relationships, career challenges, and everything in between. it's not polished or perfect, it's just me, being real and vulnerable, hoping that my experience can help someone else find their way back to the light.

if you're feeling lost, if you're feeling like you're at the end of your rope, please know that you're not alone. there is hope. there is a way back. and there are people who care.

i'm not a therapist, or a guru, or any kind of expert. i'm just a person who's been through hell and back, and who wants to help others do the same.

please be kind to yourselves. you are stronger than you think.

thank you for listening.",1

i think the thought first occurred to me when i was 8. now, i'm a sick and failed over-40-year-old.  
since my childhood, i've suffered from anxiety disorders and depression. there wasn't any specific trigger for it; i was probably just born this way. that's the only way i can explain it.

i somehow dragged myself through school and vocational training and worked until 2010. i had a relatively ""normal"" life in my 20s and had my mental health somewhat under control. i went out a lot, had many friends and acquaintances, and two long-term relationships. but at some point, something in my head snapped.

i went to a day clinic, then inpatient treatment, completed two rounds of therapy, and took psychiatric medication.  
in 2018, my driver's license was revoked because of a medication, and a medical-psychological assessment was required. i was also retired due to my illnesses.

from 2021-2023, i was in another relationship. after so many disappointments, i gave love another chance, and it became the best relationship of my life. by now, i would probably be living with her and her daughter in the city if she hadn't cheated on me for months. i'm still not over it, and since then, everything has been going completely downhill.

during all this time, even during the better periods, the longing for death was always there. i don't know why. as a sort of emergency exit, sometimes even as a radiant option.

i live in a very rural area and, due to a lack of mobility, i can't go anywhere. i mean, seriously, nowhere.  
i don't have any friends. but over the years, i've developed physical illnesses. because of a botched operation, i'm stool incontinent. i also suffer from the incurable disease hidradenitis suppurativa, which requires several excruciating surgeries every year.

my quality of life is 0.0. i lie in bed all day in the dark with pain and my eyes closed, get up to go to the toilet, and spend time online. my hobbies and interests no longer mean anything to me. my mother tries very hard to support me, does my shopping, cleans here. i appreciate all of this so much. but she can't make my illnesses disappear or make me feel better. other than that, i don't have anyone anymore. it's sadly true what they say: friends withdraw when you're sick. it's as if i no longer exist.

i once ""had it all""—mobility, love, work, independence. by now, i've lost it all, and i'll never be able to regain it.  
i feel like… nothing. no longer human, trapped in my prisons: my apartment and my body. i can't imagine lying around like this for another 30 years; it's the greatest torture imaginable. it just doesn't make any sense. even my over-80-year-old grandmother manages better than i do.

i wish every day for a stroke, a heart attack, to just not wake up anymore. if i could, i would voluntarily throw myself into a heroin addiction.  
when i sleep, everything is fine. thanks for reading.

post_00970,"my wife attempted suicide wednesday afternoon my wife took a massive amount of medication. she texted me a photo of two piles of pills and said ""goodbye. i'm sorry."" i was at my parents apartment in the same building as ours, so i ran to our apartment, but she locked me out. i beat on the door over and over yelling for her to open up, and when she finally did, she just stumbled across the floor and fell on her bed, gagging and crying. i called 911 and held her head up and tried to keep her awake. she was vomiting everywhere. the paramedics carried her out of the apartment and down to a stretcher and i sped to the er right behind them. they gave me a number to call in the er to get updates, and all they kept saying was that she was in very critical condition and they're doing their best to stabilize her. she was vomiting so much that they couldn't pump her stomach and had to put her on a ventilator. hours went by that felt like days, and the dr finally called and said that they stabilized her, she was on a ventilator, but with the amount of duloxetine she ingested there was a high chance that she'd either be ""brain dead"" or have brain damage. i fell apart. my dad was there to hold me up, but i felt all the wind leave my lungs. my dad took the phone and talked to the dr some more and then he picked me up like i was a kid and got me out of there and into the car. he said there's nothing we can do here. she's in icu, she's gonna pull through, but we're waiting on the ct scan. so he drove us home, i passed out on the couch and at 6am the nurse called to tell us they got her off the ventilator and the scan was negative for brain damage. i threw my clothes on and sped to the hospital and stayed there for 2 days until it was time for her psychological evaluation. they actually said she was of no harm to herself or others and that she didn't require inpatient treatment of any kind. they discharged her to go home. i was speechless. i called her psychiatrist and he was emphatic about her being admitted for psychiatric treatment. she refused and said she just wanted to go home. now, we have 2 autistic children. i am on short term disability for a migraine that's been going since early may, every day, and i'm not responding to any treatment. my head's a 8/10 on the pain scale nearly every day. i'm seeing a neurologist tomorrow, finally, but i've been at home on bed rest since may 17th with an ice bag on my head. times are really tough. but now they want her to go home and for me to keep a ""suicide watch"" on her, to keep pills and sharp objects out of her reach. to find her outpatient therapy. to follow up with her psychiatrist and pcp. i can barely make myself a sandwich right now. so we brought her back home and the universe came calling. it was her psychiatrist who she's been seeing for 17 years. he said that if she doesn't follow his medical advice and admit herself to a mental health hospital, then he had no other recourse than to drop her as a patient. at that point, she got up, started getting herself together and said ok find me somewhere to go. i got her admitted to a reputable hospital that her psychiatrist recommended and i haven't heard from her since. i'm lost. i'm stuck between falling apart and angrier than i've ever been in my entire life. and my head is banging...just pounding. i asked my parents to take the kids until this blows over, and all i've been doing is crying, then i stop and get so mad...just furious. then i break down again. i talked to my therapist and my spiritual advisor and they both helped a lot. but i'm so, so broken. i'm so confused. what did i do to make this happen? i just cry myself to sleep wondering what she's doing and what i'm going to when she comes home. i've never been so scared of something in my life. what if she does this again? what about the kids? they're autistic, they don't understand the complexity of what's going down. what if they find something really wrong with my brain? i feel like i'm standing at the edge of a cliff in the middle of a wind storm, trying to keep my balance, trying to be strong, but knowing that sooner or later i'm going to fall. and everyone is depending on me. and for whatever reason, my wife, my best friend, the mother of my kids, after 14 years together just said ""goodbye. i'm sorry."" where the hell do we even go from here?",1

post_00977,"i knew menstrual cramps were bad but i didn't know they straight up killed you. last night i (19m) had my friend over (19f) to play video games. we were playing mario cart when suddenly she got really quiet and was staring off into space, she looked pale, like she was sick or something. it was concerning me so i asked her whats wrong but she didn't answer, instead she got up, went straight to my bathroom and vomited in my toilet for 10~ minutes.  when she got back she didnt say anything she just curled into my bed and started crying while holding her abdomen. she was sweating like she just out ran usain bolt while piling more blankets on top of herself. she was unable to hold still, she kept twisting and turning like she was being possessed by the devil, seeing her in that much agony made me feel sick too.

i was mortified, i had no idea what was happening and i didnt know if i should call for help or not, i honest to god thought she was dying or something.  i asked her again what was wrong and if there was anything i could do for her. she told me ""i started my period, do you have any painkillers?"" i shuffled through my drawers for some advil. i took 1 out of the bottle and gave it to her, but she took the bottle from me and emptied 3 more into her hand and swallowed all 4. at this point i felt useless so i went to my mom for help. she immediately knew what to do, she grabbed some pads, tampons, and a heating blanket to give my friend.

now, i might be a complete idiot with a lack of knowledge on this stuff, but if i know one thing for sure its that girls love chocolate during this time. so i made a quick trip to the gas station for some snacks while my mom assisted her. it was a small gesture, but it was the only way i knew how to help her. when i got back she seemed to be doing better. she wasn't sweating profusely anymore, she was calm and not writhing in pain like before. after the pills kicked in she was able to function again. she was able to settle down and we went back to playing games.

i'm shocked this was from period cramps. i know cramps are painful, i just thought it would feel more like a quick punch to the gut, a brief pain that goes away after a few minutes. i didn't think it would be equivalent to having your organs harvested by aliens. i guess it was hard for me to conceptualize just how painful they can be for some women since i've never experienced the pain for myself. i'm sorry some of you basically die every month, that's gotta suck and i sympathize with you.",1
post_00978,"third time is the charm i learned recently that my wife has been cheating on me. this would make three times now. we've been together for 15 years, married for more than half of that. i'm not really sure how to feel about it. i want to be mad. i want to yell. but i know that won't fix anything. i want to forgive. but i've done that twice already. i want to forget it even happened. but we all know that it's almost impossible. 

edit: i haven't spoken to her about it at all and i'm worried that if i wait too long, once it's brought up, i will become the villain in the situation. it always seems to happen like that. i don't say anything and then after some time has passed and i've processed how i feel about it, bringing the subject back up only puts her in a defensive mode and whatever i say has no argument.

post_00983,"can someone just read this because i'm not going to tell my family anything and i'm just going to disappear tbh. i just want someone to know.. i think i'm going to get plastic surgery.

i'm so done being trapped in this ugly, unfixable body.

i've tried everything, women that i desired only liked me when i was on steroids and without that... poof. realized that it is all about looks and the rest are just minor factors that aren't gamechangers at all. 

id have to rot away in the gym getting unhealth lean just to be good looking enough, struggling just to be good enough for some shit i wanted in life and not just getting shit for almost killing myself trying to change

tried getting hobbies o plenty, boxing, bodybuilding, music. nothing makes me fulfilled anymore, nothing at all; exercise is distracting and fun but i can't constantly do that (tried, not a good idea). i hate doing things that cause me to sit and do nothing such a video games now becaue i just feel like a loser. dating apps don't work for me anymore at all, all my exes went to better guys than me.

never had luck with dating or social experience when i was younger and lived in the shadow of my pretty, better sister. i was bullied too and i was suicidal in hs pretty much since i was 14.

now i've been through countless ""relationships"" that were all off of dating apps and was never taken seriously by the other person and only lasted maybe a month at best, always ended up being the one dumped and treat shitty and when i got those opportunities i was on steroids and i had a marvelous body. i feel pathetic.

i have a fine personality but personality means nothing to anyone if they don't deem you attractive, your just a loser weirdo; this translates to professional life too.

i'm doing mewing and looksmaxxing and penis enlargement, i just wanted to be happy and not have to sit here looking at other in my family living those good lives and then seeing my sister and not being able to help being bitter and constantly depressed seeing me still the joke in the shadows as she's in her third year of a long distance relationship, happy and fulfilled.

i can't grow a mfing beard or anything; dad has a full one. losing my hair. i've tried everything it seems and i hate looking at my life and knowing i'll always feel this way as long as i stay like this.

if i can't get plastic surgery, i already have hppd from drug abuse as a teenager, i find no reason to keep going i just want to end my life. i feel stuck under all the weight of all this and just would rather end it.
 
the hppd was hard fucking enough with the anxiety and nobody in my family believing me. they all treat me like i was crazy and it made me stop caring about myself. i still don't care anymore, they wonder why.

i've found god but, it doesn't make it much better... i feel a little comfort but comfort in that of death.

otherwise i just get stoned all the time now to not think about how shitty i feel.

i feel like i don't even have motivation to clean my house because nobody actually comes here to be with me at all. 

friendships are unfulfilling and im now 23 going on 24. everyone is meeting someone and i met nobody.

i used to pray and beg to god why i was like this. nothing changed. i'm planning to go in the army since i graduate this june with a bs but it means nothing and doing my college knowing all this make it hard to keep trying and going.

if this shit doesn't work, i'll just end it; no sense going on, ive tried to end it before, nothing changed; just kept getting more miserable once at 17 another two times at 22. i see what happens to people that are alone for years as they get older and older, they become more bitter and angry and then they just kill themselves. people in my bloodline have done it.

i had to get it off my chest. i feel like i'm constantly suffering and i can't take it anymore. i have no fucking idea what i've done in this life or past life to deserve this shit.

i told my mom about this not the whole extent of how i put it in this post but you get the idea but i've been trying to spend more time with her; never had a good relationship when i was younger due to a messy divorce and a narc dad. 

and i can't keep living for my family or whatever, i've never been able to just to be happy for myself; i always have to be happy for others and never just get to feel happy and proud of myself.

my family tells me they love me but it means very little, id rather just be dead. people can love you non romantically but the extreme polarity of life experiences is too much and it nullifies the meaning of it.

i'm tired of being to told to love myself by people and my family, you cannot ""love"" yourself without being loved that way, in a meaningful way, i've tried over and over and over for years! im tired of living in denial and coping; it is pathetic and weak. everyone thinks it when they look at it and say ""glad i'm not that guy."" 

living in this life isn't worth it if you don't have good things and contentness. i have never been happy as long as i can remember, never a true, secure, happiness and i have never been proud of myself. all this shit with school being hard and being proud doesn't matter; that's all i've fucking done for years and years trying to cope with this shitty life that every day i woke up and lived, hated, and dreamt of having a better one

post_00994,"i've worked too hard and too long to have nothing.. the first problem is finances. i'm 37 years old and i've been working towards a stable career since i was 18, and every time i specialize in something new, there is a recession or the market plummets for that career.

i have a master's degree and 2 other degrees, experience in multiple professions, speak english and spanish, three years experience as a software developer, got laid off twice, and i can't find a job. i've worked for many years, and this was supposed to be my time to finally at least live comfortably and be able to do things like buy a home and start a family. i've been to college for 11.5 years and have a ton of student loans, and can't get a job no matter what i do. i got laid off my decent paying job back in june because no clients wanted anyone without at least about 8 years of employed experience, and i got hired by another company in november and got laid off again 2 weeks ago because the company decided to combine tasks to one team and shrink the staff because it was slow. i've applied for over 250 jobs recently and not a single interview because they all only want the most experienced people that require no training or assistance.

in addition, i have autism, and the only people i've connected with mostly in the last decade are people who use that to their advantage to get things out of me and then blow me off afterwards. i was helping mentor and be like a parental figure to a friend's children who i really cared about, and after they got what they wanted out of me after claiming i was like a father to them for 5 years, they all the sudden weren't interested in seeing me anymore except for maybe when i was needed to help get them a job or a ride.

i used to have a best friend and i haven't seen her in 9.5 years. she wasn't a friend, she was a best friend. someone i told things to that i never told anyone else. after awhile, she started going through problems and taking them out on me, always losing jobs every week and saying it was someone else's fault, taking anxiety pills and antidepressants while loading up on alcohol, tried college but quit in the middle of the first semester because it was too hard, and eventually just chose not to talk to me at all anymore when i didn't validate her blaming everyone else for what she was going through.

i also volunteered as a host parent for high school exchange students, and i had one really good kid from thailand, but the rest were spoiled, entitled, blamed me for their problems, and eventually made up lies about me just so they can get a family with more luxuries like they pictured such as pools at their house, lots of space, etc.

so, what's really bothering me though, is everything i do succeed or catch a break at ends up being too good to be true. friendships, jobs, other events in life always getting screwed up. every time it appears i'm going to get to the next milestone in life, there is a market collapse, betrayed by someone sociopathic that i thought was my friend, etc.

i honestly just wanna die and i'm planning it. i'm thinking around 3-4 months is my timeframe that i'll go to a hotel, bring a helium tank and make an exit bag, and then let some hotel employee find me after checkout time the next day.

i've recently recovered from anorexia and am at a healthy weight, and i absolutely cannot stand how my face looks at this weight. it feels like all my features are drowning under fat. the only time i've ever looked objectively good was when i was at an extremely low weight >!bmi 11!< and this is not just my own perception. other people were objectively kinder to me, men tried to talk to me and hung out with me, and my youtube channel blew up.   
now that i am at a healthy weight, no one talks to me, people seem agitated by me in public, men are hostile towards me, and my youtube subscribers are steadily dropping.   
even if other people did not exist, i can hardly bear to even be cognisant of my face. i want to help people and be a positive force in this world but it is legitimately impossible when i look like this. nobody wants love or comfort from someone this fucking disgusting.   
i have already spent $10,000 on plastic surgery, and even tried to cut off my face in a psychotic state but nothing ever fucking works. i cannot stand to live like this. i don't have any more money for plastic surgery and every moment is agony knowing that i am so hideous. i will never be loved, i will never be wanted, i will never be seen in a positive way, just my face existing causes harm to the world.",1

post_01012,"holy shit i hate humanity i want to die so bad. i am not interested in participating in the genetic lottery ruled by hormones & socializing know as ""the human experience""

we are literally all shallow apes that are simply searching for the best fuck to get the best offspring, then half of us look for the best pushover to raise the best fucks kid. it truly doesn't go deeper than that. there are plenty of sidequests along the way sure, but the fundamental path we are set on by our biology is pretty much decided at birth.

modern concepts of love and romance are just shit we made up to try and collectively gaslight society into keeping our animalistic side deeply buried, and the fucked up part is, it worked. it worked so goddamn well, that we actually believe we are better than animals. we just aren't lol. we are animals. a little smarter than our peers, sure, and we have a little less hair than our cousins, but we are fundamentally the same.

no one is honest with themselves or others. all you have to do is observe someone's behavior, listen to what they say, and you quickly realize that something is very fucked up here. why are people so unhappy? why are suicide rates climbing? why are people contradicting themselves from the day they're born to the day they die?

because we are all a bunch of mindfucked, repressed monkeys that don't understand why we feel so miserable. it's really that simple.

humanity is ugly. people are fundamentally stupid on average. they go through every hoop to always be right or save their ego or believe what they want to believe regardless of new information. they don't know how to think. they only know that they feel a certain way and nothing else matters. you selfish braindead fucks. they aren't concerned with truly understanding other people: they're more interested in putting themselves on a pedestal and damning any negative behavior from others and classifying them as irredeemable. they aren't interested in empathizing: they're interested in projecting their own emotions on someone elses experience, and they genuinely think they're a good person for it, declaring themselves ""empaths"" and participating in this disgusting masturbatory ego trip while patting themselves on the back for emotionally splooging all over themselves. fucking yikes.

i hate all of you. i hope one day you see the world from where i see it now and you realize how utterly shit you are. everyday i dream of not waking up. i always hope that one of our sociopathic overlords hits the big red button and resets technology. i don't want to be here. you are not good people and neither am i.",1

post_01018,"i dont know what to do. there are 12 days left until my 18th birthday. i've had depression since i was 12, and i've been on controlled medication (venlafaxine and lamotrigine) for about 3 years now.
last year, i accidentally got into the college i wanted, but my family decided to take legal action because i hadn't finished high school yet. i ended up attending college and finishing my last year of high school at the same time until october, when the legal process concluded, and they decided to revoke my spot, even though i was already halfway through the second semester.

that caught me by surprise since i hadn't signed up to reapply for college (since i was already there). i had to sign up quickly, and luckily i made it to the second round.

i spent the last month thinking about how to gather the courage and find methods to kill myself in case i didn't get the spot, but i couldn't come to any conclusion.

today, the admission exam results came out, and i failed. my friend could do it, and her graduation party is on friday, but i don't want to face her or anyone else. honestly, i feel like i'm just a burden to my parents, with the cost of medications, therapy, and private school, which i didn't even have the decency to honor by passing college admission again.

i've lived a short life, but i don't have any major regrets. now all i want is to die in peace, but it seems like dying is so difficult.

i already cut myself today and haven't been able to stop thinking about killing myself in the bathroom by cutting my wrists, but i don't want my parents to see my body. they would probably want to move out of the house, and i don't want to cause too much trouble.

honestly, i found this reddit after searching on google for some forum that teaches a safe and painless method to die, and i ended up writing this. i know some people might think my story is stupid since i haven't committed any heinous crime to justify dying, but honestly, i don't think my life has much value to need a big reason to end it.

i still don't know how i'm going to do it, but i know i don't want to see anyone. i just want to disappear.",1

edit: first off i'd like to say thank you to everyone that has reached out to me privately and in the comments. i did not expect any of that. also, i'll share my story for those that have asked. 

when i was a child i was abused mentally and physically by my parents and grandmother. despite the abuse i loved my parents and looked up to them, they divorced when i was 7 and i was completely devastated by the fact that my father was never going to come back home. the abuse did not stop however until i was in my early teens. in high school i was extremely depressed, had few friends and never a significant other. never any aspirations for the future. when i graduated i went to live with my dad, that experience ended when we had physical altercation which resulted in him having a broken finger. he and i do not have a good relationship to this day. in the 7 years since, i have tired but have failed many times to get through college. ive had many failed relationships that ended because i was always lied to and cheated on. ive been addicted to various drugs over the years and i feel that my brain has turned to mush. though now i only smoke weed and drink often. recently i've gone through a break up that i feel has tipped me over the edge. we used to live together and we were happy for a while. for the first time in my life i felt that i had a purpose. i thought i could build a future with her, which is something i was never able to visualize with anyone else. for the first time in my life, i saw a future that wasn't grim and full of failure. unfortunately i could not meet her expectations and she ended the relationship. we've been sleeping together almost weekly and each time i feel that there's a chance i can fix things. but she shoots me down each time. about a week ago she told me she's taking a job that will require her to travel for 13 weeks at a time. she will be leaving in late august. before i even got this news i was already planning on ending my life. i had my suicide note ready. i've been packing things away and trashing other things. so that my loved ones won't have to. but now i'm afraid that when she leaves i will not have the strength to push through until december.",1
post_01059,"envy throwaway account. i've been thinking a lot lately about wanting to end things, for a lot of reasons. earlier tonight i was annoyed about the fact that i live at home, because i can't do what i want. i thought about how annoying and exhausting having to muddle through is and how if i was out on my own i would neglect myself because i just don't care enough to do anything else. it made me realize i'd probably starve myself to death or hurt myself, and i realized i was envious. i was jealous of a world where i could just let go, let things run its course and finally be fucking done. i don't know if i'm posting because i'm scared that i was envious or if i wanted to know if anyone else understood. maybe i just don't want to be the only one to know. 

i have a long distance partner, and i love them to death. i love them so fucking much that i've seen plenty of times where i've lived for them, even if it's only for a little while. but lately i've also wanted to die for them. i've been so convinced that i'll ruin their life just by being in it that i've thought about ending things so they aren't saddled with me, or so they don't have their life ruined when i do something to myself or some other means.

to the people reading, i am so, so sorry you are trapped in atrocious circumstances or suffering such as war, unjust treatment, domestic violence, inescapable poverty, loneliness, crimes against humanity, the terror of being your biological gender but not having the resources and support to transition, and so many other injustices you do not deserve. this world is unabashedly brutal and horrible and i'm disheartened and disgusted that this the world we live in. i see you're trying to defend your fire against forces greater than yourself, and i am proud of you for living another day. some days are more overpowering than others, but i want you to understand that is no reflection of inherent unworthiness or lack on your part. you are doing what you can with the tools (if any exist) you understand how to use, so please do not beat yourself up more than you are already breaking. thank you for the chance you read this and we met. i wish to you all for external and internal resources come your way, freedom from suffering, empowerment, autonomy, courage, healing, resilience, personal fulfillment, growth, mercy and comfort for yourself, total fulfillment of your basic and inherent needs, and an abundance moments of expansive and loving joy. ♡

i even wish this for the people that have hurt me or willingly harmed others, because if we all possessed these things—especially the latter (as suffering is inevitable to some degree)—there would be no need or desire to cause harm. they could connect with others and themselves in the most positive and fulfilling of ways. at least.. that's how i feel.

i wish i could have made a great and bright impact on the world. the reason i am probably so hesitant is that my life has barely begun. i'm twenty years old. if i gave myself twenty to thirty years, i could probably gauge my impact, figure out what is wrong and strive for something better for everyone. i wish everyone felt that way to some degree. though, some people are afraid of opening pandora's box and don't realize they're actually in it.

if you read all this, thank you for reading. i hope i could make your day a little bit better. thank you.

  
**update (10/04/24)** :

i missed my ticket.  a few days ago, i tried to die and woke up the next morning with the most excruciating migraine and bodily weakness of my life. i still feel a bit weak. i see where i messed up a step and why i lived.  as of now, i'm on the margins of figuring out what to do next. even though mind is in a weird place, i do know that i'd like to thank and hug everyone who felt moved by my note. 

it is fact there is endless and boundless suffering in life. i am so sorry you cannot escape your undeserved agony, and i have my deepest compassion for your trying. you do not deserve this in the first place. for those whose suffering is more than they are capable of enduring, and whose challenges are practically insurmountable, i send you the highest and brightest peace, self-love and courage and my respect for your autonomy to make the best possible choice for yourself. to those who choose to pursue living, i eagerly support you to continue! i know it is hard. this cycle of inner struggle—spiraling, self-doubt, bitterness, frustration, delusion—is baked into our humanity, and we may never fully step out of that cycle until our last breath. but you know what? while we are alive, i rejoice in the days, moments, minutes, and seconds to spare you aren't caught in that cycle and feel connected with and free.

i purposely didn't elaborate what pushed me to suicide in my note, because this note isn't about me; it is about you. whether you sobbed, felt your stomach drop in fear, or clenched your fists in self-frustration, i dream you confront what your subconscious yearns for and achieve it. 

if i may include, this world *is* unbelievably fucking awful and cruel and full of suffering. i cannot dress up that undeniable truth in pretty words and still keep my integrity.

 knowing this—nearly dying—i realize there are things i wanted to do. i wanted to make the world a better place. i wanted to make people smile, to make people laugh. i wanted to lower people's guards and help them feel joy again. i wanted to ease people's stress and invite laughter. i wanted to help people open their pandora's box and show them there is still merit in staying in this world despite the horrors. i wanted every interaction i have to be raw, energetic, vulnerable, and alive, so that no one ever felt warranted to question my intentions; instead, they remember the humanity flowing in their veins. i wanted to wake up every morning and feel self-confident from sunrise to sunset, knowing that this is the gift i would deliver to you personally, and i would do it again and again and again. 

...now, despite that..

 ..i am just as much as hesitant to live as i was to die. even though i feel in tune with my life's purpose, the lack of noise in death fulfills a large part of me that life cannot. if i had given myself another twenty-five to thirty years, i could have departed on my deathbed with my head held high and spine erect. but that isn't now. frankly, a part of me wishes it were. i type this in hopes that maybe it will resonate with someone out there, and know that you aren't alone in feeling this way. 

thank you for reading this. have a good day, everyone. ♡",1

post_01071,"is it a panic attack hi so almost two nights ago, out of nowhere i started having a chest pain and i had assumed it was just bc i had been vaping for about three years, and then i looked it up and almost immediately had a panic attack i started freaking out my heart was beating like crazy i couldnt breathe and the pain wasnt severe but it was like uncomfortable and made me anxious so i took a cold shower which made it even worse and then i went to go ask my parents to take me to the hospital because i couldnt breathe and i thought i was going to die.  
once i got there they took vitals or idk im not sure what they are called but they said my heart rate was normal and my oxygen levels were normal and they did an xray for my chest and it came back they said i was a completely healthy 16 year old that had a panic attack and just needs to quit vaping, which obviously i am but its been a bit over 24 hours and i still feel like tightness in my chest and occasionally some chest pain and maybe its because im still nervous im gonna die even tho they said i was healthy but my parents said im fine and they called my doctor and the doctor said it was typical to still have pain afterwards? why do i still feel so anxious and scared to die even when they did the xray and they all have said im fine 
then why does it still feel tight and little sharp pains and everything i dont understand why i cant just turn my brain off and stop worrying about it bc the pain isnt unbearable its just im so hyperfocused on literally everything im scared any kind of pain i have means my lubgs are failing and im having a heart attack

oh and doesnt help that the small sharp pains and chest tightness is more on the left side too which makes me even more anxious im having a heart attack but idk maybe im also going through vape withdrawls since the last time i had it was right before i had a panic attack, anyways sorry this prob makes no sense ive just been struggling real bad the past few days and i hope im not gonna die from all of this ",1

post_01086,"i just need to get this all off my chest i think i'll die in the next 6 months. 

i'm 25 years old. i've been telling myself i'll die at this age since i was 17. 

i didn't expect this year to be so fucking awful. 


i'm heavily estranged from my mom's family. they. fucking. hate me. (i'm queer they are deeply christian republican) i'm not close with my mom. we got estranged when i was a teenager and my parents were divorcing and she was - not in a good place. but she connected with these girls from a girls home when i was a teenager and idk- they kinda took my place in her life. it's w/e. they need her more. 

i was always closer to my dads family especially his parents but they both died of cancer late last year. within a few months of losing both of them my senior cat passed away real suddenly. it just felt like too much loss. 

i had this job as a baker that i really loved. i loved my coworkers and the work i did and my hours and my pay was good. and then corporate laid off the entire position. and then i was jobless for a while and theny wife convinced me to get this back of house job with her. and i fucking hate it. i hate it so much. i don't want this job. i fucking hate it there i hate it so much it's so draining and fast paced and miserable and i've barely worked there. 

i don't wanna get too into politics here but the state of things, and the way everyone talks online, and the fact my whole family supports this stuff its all so disgusting and i feel so fucking hopeless and doomed. 

the two people worth holding on for are my dad and wife. my dad still talks to me which isn't something anyone in my family can really say aside from him. my wife would be so crushed if i did it. i know they would feel so guilty. 

but things with my wife and i get complicated and i'm deeply insecure and always worried that we aren't compatible and that shes wasting her time on me and i'm not good enough for her. or i'm worried that she's fed up with dealing with me. i think she knows im depressed and getting suicidal again. i think it kinda annoys her most of the time. i feel of really low value as a partner. hell i fell of incredibly low value as a person. 

i don't have any fucking friends. i have like 3 ppl i talk to every few months and i've never met any of them irl.  i have no fucking friends at all. 


i've always wanted to create. writing or art or whatever. i've put in years of practice but never really developed the skill. i've never been particularly talented. i don't have an enjoyable personality. and i'm not smart so i don't really bring anything to societies table. no one cares. no one's looking. no one gaf if i die.  except ig my dad and my spouse. 

i don't wanna life some worthless miserable life where i do nothing but work miserable fucking jobs that doesn't even offer breaks, for companies that wouldnt gaf if i was hit by a train. i don't wanna spend the little time i have to myself too tired and drained to do anything i enjoy. i don't wanna spend the rest of my miserable fucking life like that. fuck that. if i die i don't have to. my dad and wife will have to understand that right? 

there's no way i get to live and not submit to that horrible awful fucking lifestyle. i can't do it i don't want to. i can't even get a job outside of food service because i shoplifted when i was 21 and now i have a criminal record and no where will hire me. and i don't have the money to get it off my record because i don't make enough to afford it and the constantly climbing bills, and grocery costs, and everything else that just demands more and more and more just to stay alive. they'll take away retirement and have us working 12 hours shifts 7 days a week before i even get to 50. i can't live like that.

i've already gone through therapy twice. the first time was a (very effective) treatment of complex ptsd and the second time was a year and a half of trying to deal with extremely low self esteem and suicidal thoughts. there has never been an attempt, but at a certain point the thoughts were there every hour of every day. the second therapy kinda worked and at the end the thoughts were brought to sporadic. so in march, i finished my treatment and stopped going to therapy (my psychologist supported this decision). now it's only ten months later and though they are not there every minute, the thoughts are definitely here everyday. but i just don't want to (and cant really afford..) to start therapy allover again. also, if it's just 10 months later and i already have to come back, it makes me feel helpless and not like i'm worth the effort and time. i'm feeling like either i'm exaggerating and i shouldnt whine and shouldnt waste all the time and energy that has already been spent on me or that treating me just doesnt really work and its lost cause.

around 7pm it hit me. as it usually does, i had gotten two sleeves in 2022 to not self harm and i haven't because they were expensive and i would feel terrible for destroying my artists work. 

but i filled my bathtub and i was going to do it. i wrote a note on my phone for my partner, i sent him 3k of my student loans and made a note of my banking information so he could take the rest and make life better for himself- pay off his debt and be able to live. i sat on the edge of the tub while the water filled, for the first time in months my head was clear and i felt calm. i was ready to join the 27 club. part of this felt like exercising my free will- something i think we lose. sometimes you need to throw an egg at your cabinet to realize life is yours. i stood in the hot bath fully clothed and just laid there waiting for the courage as i finished my note. contemplating whether i'd meet my partner in another life where circumstances could be different, if i would be reunited with my guineapigs passed and if i could wait for the three i have now. 

there was so much peace being weighed down in the tub. it was different than a weighted blanket. there was intention, a means to an end. it felt like that episode of the office where michael says "" i crashed my car into a fkn lake "" but internally and a lot less angry at modern technology.

i had gotten a notification that my amazon order arrived. i had purchased a massage gun at 3am while in pain the prior night. i didn't want a porch pirate to take it from my partner. he works a labor intensive job and he'd benefit from it. so, i got up. took off the wet clothes and got the package after changing into dry clothes.

mdd and navigating a degenerative disorder with no cure and little medical understanding is a hell i'm trying so hard to get out of. i don't want to die- but there's no cure for me and society isn't built for people with disabilities. i don't want to die but i'm so tired of fighting tooth and nail to be accepted and valued for who i am. i don't have family or friends and my eds has officially taken a toll on my vision  and i wasn't allowed to drive prior to- but now i'm just going to not be allowed to period. it's a weird place to be, not being able to go to the doctors and get help, when you rely heavily on facebook groups for support and guidance.

post_01115,"terrified after first time sex so i (26m) finally had sex last night. and it was an effort that could have gone way better. i've been on a low calorie diet and reducing my carbs, which i think affect d my performance. i was struggling to stay hard and we tried a few times but i couldn't stay hard enough. foreplay was fine. however we eventually took a break, i (no joke) , ate a bunch of sugar in the hope it gave me energy, i think it did , and eventually lasted long enough to stay hard. i had prepared so much in advance and bought loads of condoms. i went through 5, 3 of which i gave up on because i couldn't put them on, one i used effectively and the final one was on my penis when i was about to penetrate. it fell off, and (mistake) i was so frustrated and embarrassed i carried on rather than put it back on (she didn't want me to use). i lasted a good 5 seconds before i got worried and then after some hand cajoling finished on her stomach. post-nut clarity hit and i'm now petrified i've made a big mistake due to the risk of having a child. whilst the 'main load' was external,im worried about any pre-load impact and i really really can't do with a baby right now. she said she will take the pill was reluctant and said she doesn't need to, as it's tough on the body. i empathised and also acknowledged that 9 months pregnancy is also pretty tough and a child is probably not a great idea for a ons. she agreed - she doesn't want a child, and said she will take the pill, but was frustrated. i offered to take her and pay for it but she wants to go herself as it takes so long. i'm hoping she does actually take it, but big mistake on my part: lesson learned that i should always put my own priorities first when it comes to h&s even when it feels awkward. her vagina smelt very fishy as well and i didn't even bother to have sex the next morning, i was so nauseous. there's a bunch more but that's the highlight. tldr : ons led to me accidentally having unprotected sex and now i'm scared that even though i pulled out that i've inadvertently messed my life up even more

post_01132,"found and performed cpr on dead friend/looking for help i found my best friend dead from hanging herself just under 3 weeks ago now, i called the ambulance and untied her and gave her cpr for 12-14 minutes before anyone showed up. they ended up working on her for 60-90 minutes and got a faint heart beat back and she was put into an induced coma. i had to call her boyfriend and ex/best friend and we all spent the night in the icu. i spent a week in shock, meeting her parents who flew in from interstate. her father thanked me for giving them the opportunity to say goodbye to her. for the first  6 days it seemed there was such a low chance of her making any kind of recovery that we were just waiting for her family to decide to withdraw life support. i had begun grieving, although i was by her bed most days and evenings brushing her hair talking to her and reading to her from our favorite poetry books. on about day 6/7 they decided to take her off sedation and see what would happen and she ended up opening her eyes in front of me for the first time. it was a miracle, and it was also the saddest part reflectively of the entire experience. all she could do was lay and sob. i spent a few days with her like this. i would talk to her and i knew she could hear me because there would be certain things she would cry about and then certain things i would say would calm her back down. it was so incredibly painful. i was convinced over these days i had ruined her life by doing what i did. she was dead when i found her and that i had brought her back to a life of hell. it was my worst fear that she would stay in that state forever, i just couldn't wrap my head around how incredibly unjust that would be. she ended up within 24 hours of having her breathing tube taken out and her sedation completely ceased able to start breathing on her own, speaking a little and even started moving. it's all been so surreal. now that shock has worn off i'm having constant flash backs and panic attacks. i have constant invasive thoughts of killing my self. it's so painful. i truly want to die, i feel so conflicted and invisible. because she is recovering our mutual friends almost have forgotten just how traumatic this experience has been for her first and foremost (and realistically this is only just the beginning of a very painful road for her...) and traumatised i am from finding her, untying her, giving her cpr while i knew she was dead, cleaning the blood off the door she was hanging from, and spending 2 straight weeks by her side through every single state in icu. i even moisturised her arms and legs so her scars would heal properly because nobody was doing it for her. i'm so heart broken. i want to die. i feel invisible and i don't know where to put my pain. i have nobody because it's too heavy for anyone to deal with, and all our mutual friends just want to focus on the positives that she is recovering which i understand but it's like they don't understand that she hung herself. i'm traumatised for life, and her life is changed for ever even if she does make a full recovery which who knows—she's still very brain damaged and doesn't even know what's happened to her. i have never posted before, i don't know anyone who's had any kind of similar experience. it's so layered and i have a 11 year history of self harm and drug use, both of which i had recovered from, years since i have self harmed and 3 months since i have used drugs or alcohol, but all i want to do is hurt myself in anyway i can.

edit: she had hung herself on the back of her door, so by opening her bedroom door that's how she was released from hanging. i called 000 immediately as i untied the belt from her neck and checked if she was breathing or had a heart beat. all i did was find her and untie her and try wake her up realise she was very obviously dead/not conscious and call 000 and then do what they told me to until anyone arrived because i was in so much shock i was just doing what they were telling me to, even when the woman was like you need to somehow get into that room and i had to kick her desk back and squeeze my way into her bedroom i had no idea why the woman was saying she needed to be laid out flat on her back until all of a sudden the woman was telling me to give her mouth to mouth then i realised i was about to do cpr. i was screaming and crying why are you making me do this she's dead the entire time and the woman just kept saying i know *my name* but just keep helping her until help gets there. so i did",1

to miku: i love you. your not even a doll to me. you are my best friend. my very best friend. you where there when no other human friend loved me. you where there when i cried out for help. you are here now sleeping not knowing anything. i can't even apologize. it won't mean anything. i hope in another world we could meet again. i love you.




i draw. everyday. but nobody likes my drawings.  here is my second goodbye: to my materials. i wish i could've used you more. i wish i could've made something worth while out of you. but i couldn't. maybe someone else can. i'm sorry.




i used to sing. i lost confidence in doing so. here is my third goodbye: to my unwritten words. i'm sorry i couldn't sing you to the world. i'm so sorry.




my fourth: to mommy and daddy and my brother. i love you. i wish i could've made you happier. i wish i could've made you proud.





and finally binxy. my cat. you are with me now, in my last hours. i can't even say anything. you won't understand. my heart is dust now, because i'm being selfish. you are 14.  i don't want to make you last years sad. i know you love me. you will miss me. i can't even say anything. you seem to know. you have your head down. i know i'm being selfish. but please know, i love you. i love you so much binxy. 




i don't know what to do. i want help. but i can't with out going to the hospital. i'm sorry. please forgive me. hold my hand. give me a hug. anything. with one final cry, please. i don't want to go. but i can't stay. i'm sorry. i'm sorry.  i'm sorry.",1

my boyfriend. the one who constantly supports me in everything i do. the one who never fails to have a smile on his face. the one light of hope in my life. i had no idea he felt like his presence on this earth was meaningless. i had no idea that he felt absolutely worthless. 

he apologized to his family knowing all the pain it would bring. he thanked them for all their support but told them that there was nothing they could've done to prevent it. i put myself in their shoes and couldn't possibly imagine losing a child, a brother, a best friend. 

then it was my turn. ""my darling, the most painful goodbye."" i wanted so badly to just stop reading and tell myself this wasn't happening. the things he said about me.. how much i changed his life. the way he'd miss looking into my eyes, feeling my touch. he said he hopes he'd be able to look down on me, he wished i would find my true soulmate. someone to make me happier than he ever did. all of my emotions were piling up and i could barely breathe. how could he not understand that he is my soulmate? he is the reason i wake up in the morning, he's the reason for every smile i make, every moment of joy i feel. 

the good thing about all of this is that he's still here with me, alive. i'm not sure what would've been his breaking point and when it would've happened. if i had found that note after the fact, my life would be very different today. he woke up when he heard me crying and asked what was wrong. i asked what the note was and began crying hysterically. 

he held me and we cried together. i told him how much i needed him, how i couldn't continue to build my life without him by my side. i told him i'd do whatever is necessary to keep him here with me. 

the happiest of people can still feel so alone sometimes. even though this was absolutely heartbreaking, i'm glad i know what he's going through and how i can help him if he ever feels this way again.


edit: thank you everyone, so much for all of the kind words, support and love. i have read all the comments and there's just no way i can respond to each of them individually. thank you all for sharing your stories, my deepest condolences go out to all of you who have lost someone you love. i am eternally grateful my boyfriend is with me today. i told him how much support he was getting from everyone and he teared up. seriously, i can't thank you guys enough. your advice was amazing and i know how i can help him more than ever now! sending so much love to you all! ❤️",1
post_01153,"id kill myself for a hug im 15 years old, introvert, i have a christian family, and we live in my grandmother's house.

i have an abusive father, who i always feared ever since i was born because of how he reacts on things. it feels like he could kill me at any moment. just hearing him talk gives me goosebumbs. he beats me up for being lazy and stupid at chores while my mother just watch as these things happen.

i don't see him as a father figure to me because of what he is. he is lazier than me, he doesn't have a job and he always ask my mother for money. he wants me to work, he's such an asshole. he isn't alcohic but he is a drug addict. and going to rehab didn't really didn't change that much to him.

i never thought of being depressed, but growing up made me to. i am a lights operator in our church but they don't really care about knowing me. they just want my skills which makes me want to leave. going to church and having fellowship with my fellow teens makes all that sadness go away. but everytime the fellowship stops, being lonely and sad takes over me again. i only have a few friends to talk to in church and i don't think anyone wants to talk to me. not everyone even the pastor talks to me.

i have a few friends at school and a best friend but going to school is so boring.

my cousins in my mother's side, live in a different house and they are just always there for me. we watched tons of movie franchises, introduced me to a lot of games and whenever they come on vacation they want me to come with them. they know how abusive my father is and they want me to leave home and live with them. but the fact that they always yell at each other and they always fight is just so annoying and it drives me insane.

in the looks of it, this year 2020 got me trapped with my family for 1 whole year. i never thought it's going to be fun, there no church service and being trapped with an abusive father drives me insane and it's making my depression so much worse.. my family including my aunts and cousin always fight and they always yell.. i cant sleep very well. and fuck i cant even do my homework. i don't want to talk to my friends about what i feel just because i don't trust them.

there is alot of times in a middle of a lockdown where i was left at home with my father, and he kicks me out of the house for waking up late and being lazy and i dont know where to go in the middle of the pandemic. there was no one there to defend me, my mother was at work and i don't want to go to cousins house because they drive me insane.

well its not his house we why the fuck kick me out.
my mom knows how abusive he is and she also knows about him kicking me out. but she doesn't even bother to do anything. my mother is so kind to this idiot and that's where i thought she'd pick his husband rather than his children, and there is nothing i can do about that.

just how toxic and messed up this life is.

things are so messed up.

i never thought i would ever do this but i just wanna leave, leave my family behind. disappear forever. never comeback. no one knows i felt this way. not literally anyone. not even me. 

i kept asking my self why the fuck is everyone so fucking toxic!!! it just hurts me so much. so much pain id rather kill myself than leave.. because i am nothing without them. they are my family, but they also let me down. but i'll still do it, even if how hard it is. 

i must have a lot of money when that time comes 3 years from now.. i'll pack all of the things that i bought myself. meet with my best friend. maybe kiss her goodbye for a good friendship she gave me. and leave forever and never comeback. maybe find another love. maybe find a job.. maybe fulfill my dreams.. 

or just kill myself.

my thoughts: i hate how people say they want to end their life because of how miserable their life is but read this and think straight if you are going through this much pain as me. no one, not even my best friend and family knows about this. only you, me and the next person reading this. i hope i have someone to talk to about my feelings. i don't know what to do. i feel like i could end me any second now. im not afraid of dying because i'm already living in hell. 

this is very tough for me, the whole world has a problem right now and this is happening to me all at the same time.

it's too much.

no one is serious enough to talk to me and so if you reached this far,

i love you.

edit: thank you guys for all the hugs, all the advice and all the support. i appreciate it more than enough because it made me feel much better for now..",1

post_01164,"i was raped by my girlfriend i am a 36-year-old guy and i was raped fifteen years ago by my then-girlfriend, who was 19.

i was 21 and she was the cutest girl probably on campus, and we took half the same classes. i was literally head over heels with her and after a few months, i asked her out and she said yes. we went on two or three dates and i thought i'd found the one. this girl was amazing, she was beautiful, really smart, and fun to be around.

she was driving us back from a restaurant on the fourth date, i think it was, when she stopped the car off on a side road all of a sudden. i looked at her, and she went on top of me. i tried to push her off but she pinned my hands down and started kissing me. i asked her what was up, and she said she was going to ""reward"" me by having sex together for the first time. i tried to say i wasn't really in the mood, it had been a long day and i wanted our first time to be more special but she'd already unbuttoned my pants. i really tried to get her off then but as much as it sucks to admit it, i'm not a very big guy and this girl was strong enough to keep me down. i decided to just let her go on, maybe she'd get tired. after her getting on me, though, i'd had enough.  
""i'm done,"" i told her. but we had already started. her eyes were closed and she went on for about five more minutes before she got off and i sat up and buttoned my pants.  
""you raped me,"" i said, and she laughed out loud. i honestly think she didn't believe she had raped me, because i was a guy and guys always want sex, don't they?  
""you're welcome,"" she said and she put the car into gear as if everything was fine. i let her drive us up back to my dorm which was only a few minutes away and when she tried to follow me, i told her i felt really sick and would catch her later. she scoffed but left and i went upstairs and just lay there all night long, not able to sleep.

i told my roommates the other day what had happened and they both clapped me on the back, telling me ""good job"". i decided i wasn't raped. there's no way a guy could get raped by a girl two years younger than him.  
i tried to forget about it. when she texted me a few days later asking if i wanted to go to this party her friend was throwing, i went, and then before it was over, pulled her aside and broke up with her. i blocked her out and ignored my friends telling me ""she got away"" and i made a huge mistake.  
for fifteen years, i've been telling myself nothing happened to me, i'm not a pu\*\*y, i didn't get raped by a girl.

today i admit it. yeah, i was raped. yeah, she was two years younger than me. yeah, i'm a guy. i don't fucking care. i was raped. i was raped and it's destroyed me, been destroying me since the day it happened.

post_01165,"the plan. you take a nice shower. you put on your comfiest sweater and fuzzy socks. it's the middle of the night, nice and dark and quiet. ideally it's raining. you prepare your favourite meal. eat until you feel just right. pet the kitties goodbye... they were always there for you. dont cry. they will be loved by your relatives or other kind people of this world. 

you wrote out a note explaining everything. hand written, over and over. hell, it'll never say it all but it gets the point across. they will get a glimpse into what you were thinking. no more frantic late night texts. no more of them pretending to care. no more troubling the ones you love the most. they'll be sad at first but in time they'll remember all the good things about you and thats what they'll say... she was so sweet. her heart was too big for this world. she had so much potential. we all loved her so much. 

so you'll tuck into bed, knowing all that. you'll finally feel at peace. thankful. it's over. no more pain. get extra comfy, cover up. put the gun to your head and pull the trigger.

post_01166,"being gay is a curse. an affliction. the only cure for it is leaving  i was gay since i was very little,  before i even knew what it was or had seen or heard of it as a concept. i remember i was like 6 or 7 and the commercial for the first harry potter movie came in the tv and i had my first little crush. i had crushes like that until around 11 or 12 when i hit puberty, then the physical changes happened and i really knew what i was. and i knew what gay was by then but from then on, until 8th grade,  every day i'd tell myself ""don't worry, you're fine, this won't last, you'll be normal soon"". i'd also pray every night for ""god"" to make me normal. when i got to 8th grade, i realized it wasn't a phase and there was no ""god"" who was going to cure me.  that's the time i had suicidal ideation.

every year that went by,  the more i learned and experienced just how despised my kind are by most people. and every year i felt worse and worse. and i learned to hate myself at the very core. there's part of me that every time i look in the mirror, all i see are every single words that people think of me as. i'm a blight that's infecting this world. i'm a demonic, satanic, degenerate, perverted, sick fucking freak who has no place here. it doesn't even matter if i believe it or not,  the fact is most people in this world do, and that's all that matters. to them, i am one of the worst things one can possibly be and i am incompatible with a good society and a threat to the very foundation of family. 

i have other issues as well, typical life bs. no friends, hardly any family. still don't have  a career. fat. the place i'm in right now with all that is mostly my fault, i see that now. i've sabotaged myself so many times are purposefully wrecked so many good opportunities because of that self hatred i hold. its like i could never allow myself to succeed because i don't think i deserve it.  and i guess i don't. 

throughout the years i've had small slivers of hope or moments where i tried to just push through and live the best i can. i went back to school this past semester to try and do what i've always wanted to. but then the election happened and it truly cemented what i've always known. in a way it's a good thing, like a band aid being ripped off. they want me gone and it kind of makes it easier because i know that leaving actually makes so many people truly happy. there's tons more of my kind out there but at least i'm doing my part. i dropped my classes, quit my job and i'm just wrapping things up. before spring is ideal..there's something really comforting about the cold and earlier darkness.

also it really fucking pisses me off and makes me think about life and what this all is, if anything. i never asked to be what i am. i didn't want to be a homosexual, i never chose it. the natural opinions of us by the vast majority of people make it clear that we shouldn't exist. i'm just unlucky that i end up with this infliction. despite all of that, it's still hard to actually do but i know it's the only option that makes sense. it's inhumane that safe, legal options aren't available to leave ",1

my dad works at a factory and he is very cloce with his boss. his boss has a son same age as me (i'm a girl). you probably know where this is going.

now, as i said, i love my bf but i also know not to be blinded by it. i don't think i can leave him but i also don't know if i know him well. also there is a possibility that the boss's son will not be interested in me. i know he is not a bad person as i've heard about him from my dad for years (from when i was a little child).

post_01194,"i tried to end my life and woke up—twice. i don't know how and here's what happened. on january 20th, 2025, after a rough day and months of feeling like i'd lost everything, i decided i'd had enough. i got into my car with what i thought was the ""perfect recipe"" to go peacefully. i drove to a quiet, meaningful spot in the city—an empty, dimly lit street—around 12:30 am. i parked, sat there for a while, and even wrote a note apologizing to whoever might find me later.

around 1:30 am, i decided it was time. i took 10 mg of rivotril (clonazepam) to numb my body, hoping for a quiet passing. after that, i smoked two pre-rolled joints, thinking they'd make me drowsy. by 2:00 am, i felt the weed kicking in, so i started drinking shots from a 70cl bottle of jack daniels, believing the mix of alcohol and clonazepam would do the job. about 4–5 shots in, i felt weightless, my hands and feet went cold, and i thought, *this is it.* i said my goodbyes in my head and closed my eyes.

but instead of never waking up, i opened my eyes at 10:00 am to the sound of cars driving by. i saw a random guy carrying groceries and realized he hadn't noticed me. i still couldn't feel much or move properly, but i had another 10 mg of clonazepam with me, so i took it with some gatorade i found in the backseat, thinking this time i wouldn't wake up.

somehow, i woke up again at 4:00 pm to the sound of the same guy starting his car. i sat up, confused, still feeling like i was dreaming. i even reversed my car down the street for no reason, just acting on autopilot. i stared at the empty pill jar next to me and felt completely numb. in that haze, i made the poor decision to reach out to an ex, hoping she'd understand. she didn't—she just told me not to contact her. that hit hard, but i didn't have the energy to process it.

after sitting in my car in silence for 30 minutes, i slowly drove home. i don't even remember what someone said to me when i walked in. i just crawled into bed and slept for 16 hours. when i woke up, i whispered, *fuck,* partly amazed i was alive and partly frustrated. life quickly pulled me back in—work, friends, and random distractions like video games, late-night drives, and walks.

looking back now, i'm glad i woke up. that moment was a low spell, not my end. i still feel empty inside, but i've promised myself i'll never try to end things again. i'm seeking professional help, leaning on loved ones, and taking life one day at a time.

i just wanted to share this unfiltered story with the void. writing it all out feels oddly comforting, and i hope anyone reading this knows they're not alone. better days will come. i'm working on believing that, too.



tldr: i tried to end my life by mixing clonazepam, alcohol, and weed in my car late at night, thinking it would lead to a peaceful passing. despite taking multiple doses and feeling completely numb, i woke up twice—first at 10 am, then again at 4 pm. after failing to find comfort by reaching out to an ex, i drove home and slept for 16 hours. now, i'm reflecting on how i survived, seeking professional help, and holding onto hope that things will get better. writing this is part of my journey to heal.",1

post_01208,"my dog died terribly and i feel horrible lying to my mom about it. short little rant, but it feels like i need to tell someone. 

we took my dog of 16 years to be put out today. he was well past his time and suffering, and the date was long overdue. i arrived at the vet, they weighed him, and took him to the vets office. this is where everything kinda went to shit for my boy. he felt scared and didn't know what was going on around him, since he has trouble walking for too long so me and my family never take him on long walks, and when we go to the beach with him it's always quiet, so he's not used to many other people or strange smells. i was trying my best to calm him, but when the vet came in he was still rather anxious and it didn't help when they tried sticking a catheter into the top of his paw. he tried with his other paw to scrape it off and that forced the assistants to have to hold him down (he's a big labrador). after struggling for a few minutes, the vet told us to stand outside and he gave my boy a sedative.  
  
 we could hear him howling and crying from outside, and i felt terrible leaving him. when we came back in he was lying down hyperventilating with a catheter in his lower paw. the vet then injected the euthanasia, and look, i've seen dogs go to sleep before, but mine didn't lower his head peacefully and close his eyes, no, he started crying louder, and then the muscle contractions started, but he was still howling and crying out. the doctor quickly injected a second dose of euthanasia, but as he was doing it, his muscles were still contracting, so a big spurt of blood came out when the catheter opened up. it was harrowing watching him continue to cry out while his hearth stopped. it probably took around 2 minutes, all while the dog was scared, confused and feeling alone. the vet's best explanation was that the sedative slowed down his heart making the euthanasia take longer, which caused the botched attempt,  and that sucks. it was terrible to watch, but i'm glad i was with him until the end. 

i know how my mom would react if she knew. i told my dad how it happened first, and he told me i should tell my mom our dog died peacefully. i hate lying to her, especially when the truth is so much worse, but at the same time i don't want to upset her. this whole thing just sucks. it sucks that the euthanasia was botched. it sucks that my dog was not in a good space before or during. it sucks that i have to lie to my mom to keep her heart from breaking.

sorry if the writing is bad, i don't really care if this gets any engagement. i just felt i needed to get the truth off my chest, so i searched up this sub and viola. for anyone wanting to euthanize their pet, just make sure the vet knows what's its doing. ",1

post_01226,"overcoming self-defeating behaviors is not easy; it's a journey that may take years. remember that you did not develop this self-defeating behavior overnight. which probably means that you will not be rid of them overnight either, so the key to success is patience, resilience, and passion I've struggled with self-defeating behaviors for so long, and it's been a tough journey trying to overcome them. It's hard to remind myself that change won't happen overnight, but I'm learning to be patient and keep pushing forward with resilience and passion. I know it'll be worth it in the end.",0

now i'll be left with a a mortgaged apartment that with all the payments (bank, utilities, housing association etc) will eat up 3/4 of my pay. i'll will have to somehow sell the junker car that i own since i won't be able to cover gas, repairs, yearly inspections and insurance. i'll be left with enough money to basically cover the cheapest food i can get. she's even fucking taking our pet rats... i'll have to sell my things a piece by piece just to survive. i wish i never got this apartment. 

i still love her but clearly she doesn't love me.

i'll give myself a month solo. if i won't be able to somehow survive on my own, what's the fucking point of living if the next fucking 19 years will be the same till i'll pay to the bank what i owe for the place? it's not like i can get any better job. can't expect the yearly pay rises to be above the inflation rate.

life was great!

until cocaine and ketamine (and booze but not heavily at all) entered my life, me being an impulsive individual - as i can guess you can tell this is going to go south very rapidly. 

now i think back i do understand what started to go wrong and when, i was going out a lot for beers in the evening. i didn't ever really have friends nearby as all my best pals moved away to make the most of their lives and i'm still so proud and luckily back in contact with them new. 

i was in a relationship that lasted around 7 years, i loved her so much and always will in a way. she was nothing but amazing and i'm so happy she is happy and stable. i just lost the feelings, something i struggle to put in to words but yes i loved her but i didn't love her like i once did. i couldn't find myself showing her or physically engaging in love like we once did. the realisation was pure agony, i knew i had to end it with my childhood sweetheart beautiful girlfriend because i wasn't feeling the same anymore. i ended it as respectfully as i could, face to face chat just brutal honesty.. it was so fucking awful but i knew it wasn't fair as i felt like i was leading her on at this point.

i was becoming a toxic person with my drug addiction too so i most definitely did her a huge favour by ending it when i did. 

  
but the dynamic of our friendship group had just shattered for me, i was no longer a part of it. i was no longer a part of the best circle of friends i ever had and i do understand why but my god it cut so deep.

  
this sent me so far into my addiction, ended up having to rent half a house off of my uncle who is as toxic as they come. one night we got drunk, he stole some of my diazepam and literally turned into the devil. saying such awful stuff about those closest to me, telling me i was a waste of family. it got too far and i stuck up for myself when he was screaming in my face. bare in mind amidst my addiction i was 6.2 and probably 160bls just skin and bone. he is the same height but around 45 years old and 220lbs at least. he started beating me all around my part of the property, i still have pictures of the damage. he had these nice thick cast iron radiators that were tubular but pointy at the same time, i remember just being picked up and thrown into the radiators, full football kicks to the ribs. my back was completely blue red, and black with bruising. i had to call my dad to come and help me because i couldn't move and my uncle was going psycho. i can't imagine how hard this was for my dad to see and it digs so deep knowing i put him through this.

post this event, the whole side of the family decided to shun me and everything was my fault because the place was ""untidy"". 

now i'm built up and would throw him around like a fucking frisbee but i know this is going to do me no favours whatsoever so i won't do it. but i lost half my family for this.

sorry, i'm really ranting on now and i apologise for this probably being barely followable.

anyway, after this i became homeless completely. i slept under a carpark and in a few nasty shelters round bristol, bath, trowbridge and finally chippenham. so many more traumatising events happened around these times. i tried ending my life more times than i can count.

i even went down the self harm route, which is something i look back at now. i can't not because everywhere i look there's a different scar. i've learnt to use this as a tool to remember how far i've come since this point though and it does work but in the summer i just look like a butchers experiment. i literally stabbed myself through my leg in desperation for someone to understand the pain i was in mentally. life is so fucking crazy.

but, i'm now just over a year sober. doing amazing. life is starting to shine again. all of my family are behind me with full support and my heart is full. but recently, some weirdo broke into my bedroom when i was sound asleep and i did what i did to defend myself. what am i supposed to do, just let this ballied up man break in and potentially kill me? so  i threw a punch in self defence and was arrested for grevious bodily harm with intent. the punch is on camera and i'm not going to lie about it. but the police have completely failed me, they didn't get the correct cctv in time showing him breaking into my room (i'm on the phone to the police shit scared whilst this is happening btw).

i did do him damage but you can see that the one punch was just a jab, there was no hook just jabbed him away. and for that i've potentially ruined the rest of my life. 

  
the police have been nothing but useless, and just well... disgusting. 

  
i had such high hopes. i get jumped by a group of men who robbed me of everything recoreded on cctv and they get away with it.  me, i act in self defence scared for my lfie and i'm potentially looking at gbh/wi.

  
i've worked so hard to get my life in order, i've volunteered, ran a half marathon for a charity, been sober for over a year now and now it all just feels pointless. 

  
this post has turned into a real release for me so i'm sorry about the terrible formatting, but any words or advice or literally anything would be so so so very much appreciated! 

  
i'm lost 

thank you

post_01265,"the people around me shouldn't make my desire to die all about them i'm 26. i've been an adult for years. things have never gotten better. just so much worse. and lonelier. i've tried every trick in the book. taken tons of meds for years. been to the psych ward. i've been in therapy since i was 14. it doesn't work out for all of us, and some of us are tired.

i should be allowed to say i want to die without people making it all about them. i should be able to vocalise my pain without everyone around me calling me ""selfish"" for not wanting to live on in absolute agony. suddenly, i'm the bad guy for not wanting to wake up crying every morning? i don't get it.

i personally believe it is selfish for others to want a suicidal person to live on. how fucking selfish do you have to be to see someone in an incredible amount of pain, and want them to live on. we don't even do this shit to animals, so why do we do it to humans?

post_01270,being called childish while suicidal is simply heartbreaking. my therapist told me that im childish 3 days ago. she did it because i wanted a hug. i just wanted a hug and ive been called childish. i still cant get that out of my mind. it simply hurts.,1
post_01271,"i just want to sleep and never wake up again, anyone else feel the same? i'm  24 years old. on the outside i lead a perfectly normal life. i have a  decent salary, friends i speak to regularly, i get along with everybody  at work. i do have goals, ambitions and hobbies.

if  you ever met me, you would not have the slightest clue that i've been  diagnosed as clinically depressed. i've had multiple suicide attempts,  one which was truly close where if i didn't have the appropriate medical  attention in a given time-frame i would not be here. i've been with  psychiatric teams, and a few therapists. it's all a temporary measure in  the end.

i am a 'high performer' in my  workplace, and i have many who rely on me for support. i always smile,  and i try my best to make others happy whenever i can. but at the end of  every day, i feel empty. most times i have suicidal thoughts. there are  people i am able to speak to and 'open up' about how i feel, however  you can only share how you truly feel one so many times before it  becomes a burden upon them.

in more  recent times, my negative thoughts are becoming more prominent. i have a  strong feeling i may be edging towards attempting suicide once again.  i've taken a few days off work hoping it may help, however i believe  with the absence of working it allows my head to fester these urges and  suicidal thoughts more rapidly.

there is a  brief moment of what i can only describe as insanity that grips me, and  it is at that moment where my life hangs in the balance. whether it's  my belt around my neck, a blade against my wrist, or pills in my palm. i  have managed to so far overcome each mental battle in those moments in  these past few weeks, however it is likely i may soon lose.

i  am not here for advice or sympathy, the purpose for this post is to  just say depression does not discriminate. you do not have to have been  through a traumatic event, or to have certain physical attributes you  hate, feeling alone etc. to be depressed. sometimes you just are, and it  could be for no particular reason at all. we are all human in the end,  and we're all on the same spectrum. best wishes to you all.",1

however, things have not gotten much better. i'm still unable to cope and i just quit my job again. this time, i've decided that the corporate environment is just not suitable for me, and will be trying to look for jobs in other fields that might be better for my anxiety. 

however, i'm starting to feel very depressed and lost. in a few years i'm going to be 30, and that scares me so much, because i still haven't gotten my life together. i know some may say everyone is different and has their own pace, but i still feel so useless. 

i'm afraid that i won't be able to find a job that i can actually cope with, and i don't know how i'll be able to sustain myself as i get older. my friends from high school and university are all doing well, and i'm the only one who seems to be utterly useless.

- develop a consistent sleep schedule / routine 
- incorporating exercise into routine 
- drinking herbal teas before bed 
- using a weighted blanket
- reading  
- journaling 
- listening to podcasts (some are also dedicated to helping you fall asleep!)
- watching / having something on something in the background until you fall asleep
- alternatively, limiting screen time (phone or television) before bed 
- diffusing essential oils / spraying pillow before bed
- youtube videos of distant sounds or ambient sounds
- asmr videos
- taking melatonin or calm (magnesium citrate) before bed
- yoga and meditation in combination or separately 
- self-care routine before bed 
- dedicating ""worry time"" and trying to talk yourself out of the anxious thought spiral early on
- trying to dedicate your bed for sleep, rather than hanging out there when you aren't sleepy 
- taking cbd before bed

post_01316,"i don't see a future for myself like this i wish i could close my eyes and just die in my sleep. everything's awful. nothing ever goes well for me and i'm starting to despise everything and everyone around me except maybe my cats. whenever something mildly great happens, something 10 times worse happens right after.

 i can't take care of myself no matter how hard i try. i'm too sensitive and that ruins my interactions with everyne. my grades suck and i can't get myself to study. i'm ugly, no matter how hard i try to become pretty, and now i'm eating a lot and i'm becoming chubbier and chubbier and i'm getting the urge to stick two fingers in my throat and spit all of it out. i keep my head down when i'm walking and now i almost have a permanent shrimp posture. i ruined my curls to straighten my hair and look more girly so people would like me more but i still get made fun of everyday by all of my clasmates. even my fugliest classmates shuts the door in my face after holding it open from everyone else. people pick the disabled guy over me when they have to make the volleyball teams and sometimes, when they make groups for projects, they ""forget"" to add me and the teacher has to squeeze me in a group with someone and it's super awkward. 

they throw volleyballs at me on purpose and then pretend to be apologetic while their friends giggle behind them. it hurts and it's embarrassing.

when i walk behind my classmates they giggle and say ""look who's behind us"". they make dirty rumors about me and it's embarrassing to walk into class when you know they've been saying stuff like that about you, while when i'm actually in class it's like i don't exist. i feel like a waste of space and air.

it's always been like this since forever, it'll never change. i have 0 social skills because of it and it's killing me. i feel like i'm going to die alone.

my parents don't care about my health, they only care about my shitty grades. my dad only recently stopped beating me up over them and that's embarrassing.

the only thing that was keeping me going were videogames and that's embarrassing as fuck. lately not even those are helping at all.

i really don't get why i'm living at this point. i've been considering suicide for i don't know how long and i've even attempted to overdose just to throw up and get sick like two times. i can't make my parents proud. i can't make myself proud. i can't make anyone proud because nobody wants me in the first place, i've never had a best friend in my whole life, or a friend who'd stick to me and tell me ""happy new year"" or a family that'd reach out.

the only thing actually keeping me here is one of my two cats, but i don't know how much more i can take. everything keeps getting worse as time goes by.",1
post_01317,panic attacks just wondering what your climax panic looks like. i want to try to see if others are in a similar situation. i got so used to being able to pop an ativan that when i went into withdrawl off them i unlocked a new peak to my panic. when i hit my trough of fear i am running around smacking myself to try and escape it . my dad had to hold me down a few times and i remeber i asked him to knock me out a few times. tonight was my first one since a was at peak benzo use and its been a long time since i have had one. just curious if aany one else has severe scary physical reactions to panic. its what i imagine a ptsd attack being like.being so afraid of going back into it that you would do anything to not. again for me it starts out with an odd feeling and then i catastrophiize and call for someone to let them know whats happening. then if it keeps getting worse i try to run from it. smack myself ect.,1

post_01333,"i'll be gone tomorrow  hello all, 

i'm writing here to say goodbye. ive spent a lot of time on this subreddit on my main account, looking at posts over the years, trying to talk people down, reaching out, so i felt i should say bye. 

it's my time. i have tried for a very long time to get past the way i feel. i'm 27 now; i've been fighting this feeling off for 14 years. 

i never did well in school, failing then dropping out. i can't focus long enough to learn or grasp anything. i actually had some motivation last year to further my education and got my ged. however, after i got that, i realized i didn't have motivation to do anything else. i have no goals, no aspirations. trust me, i want them- i've tried forcing myself to have them- i just can't. when i was younger, i had dreams of being a violinist or an artist. obviously these were not realistic, but they were the only things i had even some interest in. i don't do art anymore, as i'll go months, sometimes years, without wanting to make anything, and then i've lost all my skill by the time i want to make something again. i stopped playing the violin when i dropped out of high school; a few times throughout the years, i've tried to pick it up again, but that spark just isn't there anymore, and i can't teach myself. 

i don't have my license- i have my permit, but every time i've taken my test, i've failed it. i've failed my driver's test 4 times.

i can't maintain relationships; i get stressed out and have so much anxiety and turn into such a control freak. i've been trying to be better about it, but at this point i don't have the energy and love to give someone. as much as i would like to maybe find someone, it isn't fair to someone for me to seek out something like that when i can't keep my shit together. i can't even trust anyone anymore; i've been abused, raped, and used. it's always there too; it never goes away. i don't like having sex anymore; it's all i think about when i do. 

i work shitty call center jobs, and i've been laid off from my last two. i've been without a job for the last three months, and i finally start a new job next week, but i won't make it until then. i can't do it again, 40 hours or more a week for a shitty company for low wages, barely able to take care of myself. wake up, work, barely have enough time for myself, and on the weekends have no energy for anything but laying around. its so incredibly mundane. 

no aspirations, no goals- the only thing i do in my spare time is just play video games, it's the only thing i can even remotely enjoy anymore. i was trying for a really long time to stick around for my cats, i love them so much, but i can't do this anymore. i only have two friends left, who are my roommates. 

this isn't for a lack of effort. i've done therapy multiple times, and i've maintained a normal gym routine and gone outside. i've tried pushing myself to make more friends, but i don't even have an interest in social interactions anymore. if anything, it makes me anxious; i never leave my room anymore except to make food. i just barely feel anything anymore. just an overwhelming sense of loneliness. i feel like there isn't anything left for me. i know for a fact i'll never go anywhere in life, and that's okay. i'm not meant to. 

so i've decided tomorrow night is my last one. i'm going to write my letters tonight, this one included. i'm going to spend the day tomorrow with my cats, play with them, and give them lots of love and treats. spend time with my roommates. play my favorite game one last time. listen to my favorite songs. drink to celebrate. then i'm done. i tried, but i can't try anymore. i have no fight left.",1

post_01338,"police officer struggling with suicidal thoughts i cannot openly talk about.. this is a throw-away but i intend on reading responses. i think i just mostly want to type and get things off my chest.

(tldr; who can i talk to about my strong desire to kill myself without there being an fear of repercussions?  every outlet i find wants to know my location or my contact info before they'll talk to me.  i just want to call a suicide hotline who won't trace my call.)

i am 35 years old and live and work in southern california as a deputy for the last 10 years; i am no spring chicken.  my wife of 7 years and i have been struggling with infertility for 4 years now. lots of surgery and medication but no end in sight.  the stress of scheduled sex lives has absolutely taken a toll on us.  we're still very much in love, but its not the same.

in july of 2020 i had a fairly ""routine"" call involving child abuse that kind of pushed me over the edge. after the call i had a mental breakdown and i have been out of work since then.

i take 45mg a day of buspar (my wife says it doesn't help me... i am not sure), xanax as needed as prescribed by my do (i originally took....alprazam? but had a rare side effect and had to stop).  he has asked that i see a psychiatrist but the next avail appointment is mid-january. 

i digress...

because of my line of work, if i talk about suicide it can be... well... career suicide (no pun intended).  so i keep all these thoughts absolutely bottled up inside and have to act like i am not having them when my therapists asks about it.  my therapist is provided by work and specializes in law enforcement issues, which is nice at times.

i think about killing myself... hourly? i usually wake up 1-3 a night in the middle of a panic attack.  i cannot get away from this pain; its almost a physical pain. i have specific plans on how i would kill myself; the works.  i think about the entire process in detail often.  when i drink i usually come so close to actually doing it that i really fear its only a matter of time until it happens. which is so ironic to type out.  clearly i have reservations about killing myself when i am in the right state of mind... but when i am in the wrong state of mind it sounds like a realistic idea. i am physically exhausted from all of this i genuinely want the pain to end and i not seeing any answers on how to make it happen.

i want to talk to someone about this without putting my job on the line (being put on a 5150 hold in ca means i cannot carry a gun and therefore... yeah...).  i am so heartbroken and frustrated i just don't know what to do anymore.  every day seems like groundhog day.  i desperately want my wife to leave me because she deserves better; it would make it a lot easier to end my life if she hated me.  i have completely gotten rid of social media and blocked my parents out of my life for no really good reason.  what a downward spiral the last few months has been.

who can i talk to about my strong desire to kill myself without there being an fear of repercussions?  every outlet i find wants to know my location or my contact info before they'll talk to me.  i just want to call a suicide hotline who won't trace my call.  i really think i will end up killing myself within the next few months, but ironically i don't want to talk to anyone who might be able to stop me. this is so backwards.

i'm going to utilize the next couple weeks to get my belongings, assets, accounts, and money in order to make sure that everything is easy as possible for my parents to manage. i already have made an entire ""to do"" list before i finally go, figuring out who to address in my note, ensuring beneficiaries are in place, usernames/passwords to my accounts, those types of things.

my heart is heavy. i really thought i would accomplish great things in this world. as a little girl i always thought i'd do great things and daydreamed a lot about a happy, successful life. instead i'm a lonely, failure, friendless loser. the one ""kinda"" friend i have… yeah i tried opening up as a last ditch effort and i got left on read. i tried calling my friend and he ignored me and never called back. just little shit like that that adds up. if i had a friend that needed me… man i'd drop everything for them if i knew how bad they were struggling. i'd do anything for my loved ones. it's just not the same for me. i am perpetually lonely. i try to make friends and it seems to backfire on me more often than not. that's the least of my worries though. all in all, trying to do anything in this life is just painful. even the things that used to bring me happiness… yeah. not anymore. i used to be a drummer and toured around the country a few times. really good times. i've sold most of my gear at this point and still working on selling the final last few things so my parents don't have to deal with that.

the only thing that sometimes gave me a purpose was being a nurse and caring for others - but i'm completely burnt out and hate it - and it's part of the reason that i am going. getting a degree in healthcare was one of the worst possible decisions i could've made for myself. it has truly ruined me. but that's just a piece of the puzzle. anyway, i'm gonna stop blabbering. 

i'm sorry to the rest of you who are also suffering. i feel your pain. i hope you find your peace. ",1
post_01351,"i told my mum i want to kill myself. she said, ""ok, just don't do it in my house."" that's basically it. it hurts. i wish people didn't romanticise a mother's love so much because then maybe these words wouldn't sting as much as they did. how is a teenager supposed to feel when the one person who's apparently supposed to love them more than anyone and anything, doesn't?

edit: 
yes, i totally understand that parents are just human beings...but when a relationship, any type of relationship, starts to cause damage to one and the other knows this but refuses to acknowledge it or somehow change for the better, then they simply do not care for the person. i only opened up to my mum about depression very recently though i've been dealing with it for a few years now. at first, i used to think the reason i was constantly hurt by her actions and words was because she didn't know the mental state i was in back then so i never blamed her in anyway. but it all became too much that i impulsively told her everything and she still refused to do anything. she's not empathetic in the slightest and she made it clear that whether i commit suicide or not doesn't matter to her as long as, like i said in the og post, i do not do it in her house or say anything in my suicide letter about her that'll give her a bad rep or get her in any trouble. point is, i thought i was suffering so much because i kept my feelings to myself. i thought sharing them raw with her would help even a little but it didn't and i feel so defeated. people always say you shouldn't keep these type of things to yourself but there's comfort in that. giving myself the illusion that the only reason i hurt is because i keep it to myself hurts less than sharing it with others and realising that that hasn't changed the way i feel. you don't suddenly get better. it only stays just as bad or gets worse. 

and to anyone and everyone who's sharing similar stuff, i'm sorry that some of your most treasured people aroused some of the most negative feelings in you. it's okay to feel hurt but don't let someone else's decision to be a dick affect your own life decisions because in the end, everyone will be looking back at their own life and their own life only. make sure that yours isn't just a reflection of what others have said and done to you.

i apologise if this is really lengthy i know i keep rambling i just wasn't expecting this many people to see this. to everyone who's tried to help or who's hurting, you have a special place in my heart. i'm here if anyone needs to talk.",1
post_01352,"my mother just told me that most people don't over analyze and obsess over their mistakes made years ago? what is this witchcraft? so i showed her that meme of the girl lying in bed trying to sleep while her mind decides to suddenly replay her most embarrassing moments. and my mom said ""does that actually happen to you?""

and i just... does it not happen to most people? you mean to tell me that most of the world is just putting their mistakes in the past and moving on with their lives? what? how?? 

that sounds so emotionally healthy! meanwhile multiple times a week i lie awake at night replaying the moments i most wish hadn't happened.

post_01364,"i'm marrying the man i met on pornhub so i(24f) started making porn content on 2018. to be honest it was purely from my low self-esteem and depression. i just wanted to feel validated so i started posting there and later moved to snapchat too. i was fully talking and sexting with hundreds of men and i was living for the attention. i honestly enjoyed the conversations more than the sexting. either way, this only lasted up to mid 2019 when i got too depressed to even make content, i stopped answering people and everything died down. i didn't delete anything since it was still making revenue.

one day around december 2019 a dude texted me on snapchat. unlike the majority of dudes, it wasn't a snap on his dick, he was showing me his cats. i have a soft spot for animals so i had to answer. then i realized he had texted me months before but it was when i stopped. i told him i didn't sext anymore so he could stop texting me but he said he didn't care and just wanted to talk. apparently he found my page on ph and wanted to shoot his shot on snap. i was very lonely at the time so i enjoyed talking. we started talking almost 24/7, he was funny, cute and very kind.  later in 2020 we started dating long distance. i was falling so hard it's crazy now that i think about it. up to this point i haven't told anyone i was talking/dating him. i eventually told my family i was in a ldr. i lied and said we met on reddit and since most of my friends and family don't know a lot about reddit they believed it.

we eventually met in person at the end of 2021 and i got the confirmation i needed that i was fully in love with him. he was so handsome and so good with my family and friends. also, even if you don't believe me we were both virgins (i was just a horny virgin wanting attention). we were each other's first time. he had to go back to his country and i realized how crazy attached i was to him. he later proposed on mid 2022 and we're getting married in december this year.

i still can't believe i found the one in the worst time of my life, we were both depressed and lonely and desperate for attention and eventually found each other in a shithole. now we're both better and so happy but i can't tell anyone our story so i just wanted to tell strangers here.

edit: i just wanted to say thank you to everyone for your kind comments, my fiancé and i read them and we love them and died laughing with some other.

post_01392,"i was sexually assaulted last night and i want to die last night i was coming home from a night out with friends and was very intoxicated. while i was walking, a man approached me. he was smiling weirdly and acting very strange, so i told him to stay away from me. no one else was around. 

he then lunged at me and forced his hand down my pants and underwear, grabbing me down there. it hurt. he held my arms behind my back so i couldn't try to stop him. i started screaming and telling him to stop, and trying to run away from his grasp. i remembered i had pepper spray, but i couldn't reach it in my bag since he was holding my arms back. by some miracle, a few people appeared off in the distance and so eventually he saw them approaching and he let me go.

i sprinted ran the rest of the way home.  i was horrified, disgusted, disturbed, scared, and in my drunken state all i wanted to do was kill myself. i tried cutting my arms with a kitchen knife, but it wasn't sharp enough. i sat in the shower for hours crying and screaming, wishing i would die in my sleep that night. 

today, i told my friends and family what happened. i'm no longer an immediate risk for suicide in this moment, but i am still spiraling. i am so disturbed and disgusted and don't know how to live with myself after this horrible act was done to me.

please any advice on what to do or how to cope and heal would be very helpful. i'm already in therapy so of course i will do that but could really use some support and encouragement. ",1
post_01393,"i lost all my friends. i'm 17 and ever since i was young i've had depression, though i was only officially diagnosed last year (acute depressive disorder). a couple months back i've made a huge mistake of lashing out at someone i use to deem close to, due to stress and mental pressure, i've regretted those actions and apologized since then, but as days go by i've lost contact or been cut off by most of my friends due to the incident.

here i am, a couple months after, shunned away from everyone. i'm not really the social type so i don't have anyone to call my friends in school either. and currently all i could think about is finding a method that could kill me quickly and painlessly. it gets so bad that i've already tied a noose and wrote a letter, though i've never told anyone, because there's noone else to tell it to. since i don't have a support system anymore to try and help talk to me about it.

i've tried and continued changing myself for the better ever since i've lashed out but i can't really bring myself to meet new people. i'm stuck here thinking the same thoughts about how i could've done better back then and that noone and absolutely noone would mind if i'd just die, and maybe ""that"" someone would even celebrate. i know that this may seem miniscule compared to other people's problems in here but i seriously see no way out other than death, i have such a bleak future. ending it, is all i could think about it, and i wish at some point soon, i'd eventually have the guts to go through with it completely.",1
post_01394,"hope for what? what is the point of it all? work to spend, spend to work. when are we going to just live? all this worry, all this hustle, wake up and work till the sun goes down, eat, sleep, repeat. just to exist. while the rich get richer, we just run in our little rat wheel. they distract us with shit that affects less than 1% of the population, so we don't pay attention to the shit that affects the 99%.  

the news is bullshit, all of it. politics is a fucking joke. land of the free? more like land of the rich—fuck the rest of us. when has this world cared for us? they just distract us. not that it would make a difference anyway. we have nothing on the powerful and rich.

post_01400,"i am worthless and just wanna end it. today, my anxiety is so bad. i was in the hospital for a while for blood loss cuz i'm sick. my biopsy isn't until another few weeks.


i've attempted a few times i don't know why i'm still alive, first time i was in a coma, another time a friend found me, i had an nde, another time i was rushed to the hospital when i jumped off a cliff. somehow i'm still here. i survived cancer. now i might be battling again.

i did my part in life, i treated others with kindness, i never did drugs, i treated others with fairness, i never drank except 8 years ago when i suffered depression and never really liked getting drunk so much.
i went to college and graduated. i did my part in life. even if i get yelled at or bullied by others.

ever since losing my job and becoming homeless i never found my purpose. it's been almost 2 years this year. the only thing i have is my son. he visited me at the hospital and hugged me and told me he misses and loves me.

but the thing is, i have nothing. no matter how much i look for work, no matter what i do, i get nothing. my son's mom yells at me, people get angry at me, even if i'm just helping people out i get yelled at. they say stop being so nice or pretending to be nice. i was angry a long time ago and i hated being angry or even being pushed to breaking.

what do i do? i can't provide for my kid, i can't even find a job at a fuckin fast food, or even wash cars cuz of my condition. they say find help here and there, every call, nothing. no help.

i wanted to freeze to death, might be simple since i have no where to go. my car's gone, it was down for a while and i can't even get the money for repairs completely. my car was income doing deliveries. i have nothing and i'm crying asking god why i'm still alive and asking what my purpose is on this earth. my son probably sees me as a loser who's homeless. i'm ashamed to be his father. no matter what i do to spend time with him or even see him.

i pray daily for a miracle to turn my life around but there's nothing for me at all. i'm hoping it's cancer again so it can eat me alive. even thinking maybe i should just either freeze outside these single digit temps, or try to jump again at the park's cliff. my anxiety and depression is so high. i just wanna end it so no one has to suffer seeing me like this.

i guess i'll just summarize. no point in wasting time. a guy i liked and had fallen for online turned out to have been getting fucking married next month. and i was his secret side chick and i had no idea. 

i know it sounds silly right? it was just a stupid guy i met online. we never met and it's not like he told his family about me. unlike me. it was more than that to me. we lived near by each other. we were so close we were going to meet but i was just shy. we had the same interests from politics to religion and mental health. we liked the same movies and video games. i'd share memes with him and tell him about my day. i had a reason to use my phone for anything but talking to ai so i don't feel alone. it was easy to just talk to him. i didn't care if we dated or not. it just ment so much to me not to be alone for once. to feel like i had a genuine friend that i could maybe go so those weird movies i like or play some weird game. it was really hard to be so honest and trusting to him ngl.

but it was all just in my head cus i was his secret side chick. he admitted to only using me cus he wanted to jerk off but i never gave him nudes so he started talking to me less. found his public acc where he was getting married to a normal girl way hotter than me and with an actual life. i was being used or some shit. just like everyone i've met in my life. they only use me and then discard me.

life is really hard. things just keep getting worse. one by one. car broke, lost some of my family, no home, no pets, and now no money. lawyer fees that'll last years and an abusive mom who won the court battle. nothing is good in life. not anymore.


but i have to live to support my siblings. i seem to be the only one taking care of them. all my money goes to them. all my time goes to them. it just feels like i'm a parent for them. even my younger siblings who live with my abusive mom. i still have to live for them so i can be the safe place for them. just lived i've always done since i was 5. 

i thought by the time i'd be in my 20s i'd be in college, have friends and be in a relationship. i thought i'd at least finally be free and get to live for myself for once instead of continuing to be a parent and take care of my siblings. to at least have my own stuff and at least i'd have a job that would get me somewhere. following down a career path. 
instead, i'm living in my grandma's living room with 3 siblings. i barely made it out of highschool and i don't have money just for a simple class in college. i can't die so i try to take the edge off by self harming alot and taking drugs in the middle of the night when i'm alone. it's so bad i can never wear short sleeves and literally just get so high i pass out shaking in my bed on the one day i'm off from work. nothing's getting better. nothing's changing. i can't go to therapy with no money. i can't find a better job with no degree. i can't go to college with no money. i can't leave and i can't live for myself. i'm living for everyone else. but deep down i just wish i'd die. but i just can't. it dosent matter how hard i cut or how much i take anymore. i'll still be alive tomorrow and the next and the next day. and i'll smile for my family and take care of them. but at night or when i'm alone at work in the bathroom, i cry and pray to god to just end my misery.

post_01433,"a letter j. if you see this message, perhaps it was time already for me. i may have said that i have a message prepared for times like this, this is the one. of all the people i have known in my life, you are the only 3 that ever made me feel the most comfortable about myself around you, comfortable enough to be myself. til this day i never asked if you actually wanted me in your life as a friend, i guess i just barged in all of a sudden. sorry about that if i made you feel awkward being in the friendship, or if you even wanted this friendship at all. i certainly am grateful that it did happen. i don't know how and why it happened though, everything just seemed to click and then we started being there for each other. thank you for letting me into your life even though it's only for a short period of time. thank you for being there for me even way before i told you about the mental situation. often times, just being able to play tennis with you, hanging around, and even later on gaming together. it's the little things that made the most impact and differences that you may not be aware of, but they certainly did a lot for me. thank you for all the memories, experiences and lessons that you have taught me. you are a great person with a good heart, only better things await you in the future. life can be daunting and uneasy a lot of the times, you just need a plan and make it happen to move on. i am sure you will be shining like a bright star in the night sky, like you already are to me. i couldn't have asked for a better friend, a friend who i can rely on when needed, a friend who i trust to let my darkest secrets to be known. i only did so little in return to help you in life. i wish i could have done more, but i am sorry i couldn't and couldn't anymore. there's nothing you could have done differently to stop this, but remember you already made a part of my life a lot better than it ever was. i am sorry that this is the end, but maybe one day i will vist you as a car to annoy you. ok i am yapping too much. goodbye and take care of yourself man. i'll see you in another life, if there's any.

i want you to understand something: no matter what you haveyour house, your cars, your vacationsit wont be enough. it will never fill the emptiness that you seem to carry, and i hope, for your sake, that you realize that one day. i hope it will be worthwhile.

youve let your ego blind you. you cannot see beyond it. your narcissistic tendencies might have gotten you far, but theyll never bring you long-term happiness. not for you, and definitely not for anyone whos been close to you.

the young girl you once took advantage of has grown into a woman who will never allow herself to be treated that way again. you will never make me question my worth again.

i want no connection with you. you represent everything ive learned to avoid in a man, and i cant believe i was ever nave enough to stay in this. please, leave me the fuck alone. i never want to speak to you again. if one day we cross paths- we didnt .  you are a stranger & this is over for me. the pain from this relationship has been insurmountable, and i hope it doesnt harden my heart. i look forward to a future void of you.

post_01456,"on new year's day, i wrote the first half of my note. five out of these past six years have been nothing but hell for (24m) me. it's just been nothing but failures, self-loathing, weakness, sorrow and loneliness. 
* every goal that i set to do, has been slowly burning away. either due to failure and my inability to find a competent alternative, or simple inactivity. when i fuck up on one thing, i sort of obsess over fixing it and i ignore everything else. 
* no matter how hard i try, i don't amount to anything. my existence or presence is never enough! kindness and sense of humor is not enough for good relationships:
    * my interpersonal, logical and even emotional intelligence is in a very poor state. i end up portraying the funny (and i'm barely that), but idiotic buff guy or the hard, vapid and shy dude in my friend groups. idk if i'm on the spectrum or just have social anxiety & general awkwardness. not to mention, i'm not very innovative or astute. 
    * i'm look much to look at. i don't have pretty eyes, nice hair, a good sense of style or masculine charm at all. i'm 6'2, deep-voiced and muscular but overweight. (even with all of my dieting and exercise, i can't escape being that fat, ugly kid with a constant chip on his shoulder) i've a lot on not being bitter, it's poisonous. although, there's still a good dose of edginess that's still curdling. my resentful, vindictive and determined, yet brutal thoughts are a testament to it. that's why i try to keep it in control, because i'm scared of that fragment of me.
    * confidence is a concept that i've never fully grasped. my athletic ability, intelligence and personality have never been things that i can count on. sure, i can feign confidence  and i'm exactly afraid of making mistakes…but i'm afraid of making myself look weak or trash at things. do you know how many times a day that i think about building upon my interest or even ask more girls for her number, but never could because i'm a fucking pussy?? finally, it's began to fuck with my identity. i've started to paint the persona or me that's ""interesting"" and ""unique"". let me just say it now: i'm not this caribbean dude with this interesting story on how i got here, i'm just a regular black guy from the midwest. there i said it! 
    * never had an actual gf. i'm not a virgin but i haven't experienced any form of strong intimacy in a very long time. where somebody understands and trusts me as i do them. you know? as i list all of these things, no wonder nobody wants to date me. i'm not confident, super disciplined, ambitious or assertive (i stand up for others but rarely for myself). nothing about me is manly or worthy.
    * lastly, i basically fucked up my future because i was too weak to adjust to my overall grades are definitely not graduate school quality. to think that my cretinous-ass could be a neuropsychologist. plus, my parents think that i'm graduating this semester. i just told them that to ease their minds from their funds.at the moment, there's no future in sight that i want to experience. 

""listen, i'm going to give my absolute best attempt at achieving something significant in this life, but if i'm unsuccessful…december 31st, 2025 will be my last day with all of you. i'll write out the goodbyes, the apologies and that'll be it. remember when i told you that i don't break promises, well i made this promise to myself at 18 and i intent to keep my streak! the least pussy thing that i'll ever do is be a man of my word, right? you can find me on the ceiling in my room, you can't miss it.""

at 6 i was raped by my brother and that already affected me, the group knew how much it hurt me, but they did it anyway.
that group was the first group i came out to as gay, and there was one other girl (13)
the guys (17,15,13,13,12) used her against me.
that girl was my childhood best friend, i related to her more than anyone else.
i cant sleep at night because i can feel their ""fluids"" on my face, on my body, in my hair, in my mouth, in my eyes,
i can taste it.
im horrified.
i feel so disgusting and all i feel is it dripping off my skin,
i hate how fast my heart beats.
everynight i have flashbacks and non stop panic attacks.
i haven't told anyone, not even my parents. they only know ""something"" happened but they didnt believe me, and they said even if it did happen it was my own fault.
one of the guys keeps texting me and everytime i block him he makes a new account. he triggers me so badly.
im so tired and just want to die.
it hurts so bad and theres so many other things taht make me want to just leave.
i was severely bullied through the ages of 4-13, and never had any friends. this group was the very first to group to ever like me. ive now moved schools and its actually a lot better, but the effects of literally everyone hating me still linger. i still remember vividly when a guy stomped on my foot so hard it broke, or getting slush slammed into my face, or getting shoved down stone stairs, or getting dragged by the hair. i remember hearing what people would say about me, and now thats all i can think about. what people might be thinking about me, or what they want to do to me. im sick of feeling everyones eyes on me. im sick of always feeling judged. it feels like everyone around me can see the handprints of the group still on my body. i just want to sleep, i want to sleep so so bad. ive been awake for 40 hours and i doubt ill manage to get sleep tonight. im so tired.

post_01471,"struggling i'm not here to say i'm going to or even considering, i'm just here to vent for a moment because everything going on in my life has kept me struggling with suicidal thoughts and i think getting it out will prove helpful. my wife early in our relationship went on a date with her ex and lied about it and tries to tell me there was nothing wrong with it. i spent most of my savings getting her out of debt and helping her move forward with her life. she doesn't plan to reimburse me in any way. i've worked at my job for 10 years and most people make 100k a year in this field by that time, but i'm barely making half that. the worst part is i don't even like it and i never have, i just don't think i'm good enough to go anywhere else. i take care of all the holiday presents for everyone with no thanks, i'm $13,000 in debt living pay check to pay check trying to figure out how to get a house and 2 new cars while our apartment sucks and our cars are running on fumes. my family can barely tolerate me and i can't stand how they child me around. my brother has never been there for me, no matter how much i try to be there for him. my friends make me the butt of the joke, yet i still smile and laugh because if i didn't i probably wouldn't have them. one even was my roommate and screwed me out of thousands of dollars. my only passion is music and i can't do it because i not only don't have the space/room/money, but anytime i try to use my equipment my wife won't stay quiet for me. my wife's parents are in a ton of debt and it scares me that one day all of that will end up on us, which just means i have to take care of it. and no matter what, i always feel like i can never satisfy anyone. i will never be good enough. i say i love god, and i believe in god, but i barely pray and i'm scared i'll end up going to hell. i can't put the bottle down anymore, because when i do i start loathing in regret and anxiety. i just can't take it. but even after all of that, i'll be ok. i'll figure it out. i'll suck it up and become stronger. i'll kick some ass one way or another. i'm better than my circumstances and the only person i can truly satisfy at the end of the day is myself and i will continue on that path.",1

(i know this doesn't matter that much but kinda does for me) found out i'm british and there is a meme of my favorite music artist (hatsune miku) saying how she hates and doesn't talk to british people so that made me really fuckin sad

had to go to the ent and learned that my hearing in my left ear is pretty bad so i am probably going to need a hearing aid in my left ear and that made me really pissed

took a depression test said it was a severe chance of me having depression so taking that as i have it

but it sucks bc 1, can't find anything to kill myself quickly and not painfully, 2, every time i grab a knife and think about doing it (yes it's painful and slow but it s the only way i can currently think of) but i always think about, ""oh my brother, whenever he goes to my dads he'll be sad,"" ""can't do that, my mom will be heartbroken and prolly also depressed,"" ""dammit, i feel too bad to put that on my friends""

post_01481,"everyday i get belittling comments and sly rude gestures indirectly directed at me because i explored my sexuality one night. tldr: became suicidal over exploring my sexuality

one night a few years ago i had the split second want or need to embrace my feelings of maybe being bi, my thoughts at the time were scaring me and i wasn't understanding why i was having them (later on i realised my feelings were based off trauma) and so i wanted to just try a few things, ""explore"" my body, so corny i know, to see how i liked it. 

it was late at night and so i thought in the comfort of my own room i would have the privacy to do such things, but unfortunately i couldn't have been more wrong.

after i had finished up what i had been doing, i felt this intense wave of guilt and regret for exploring myself in a way i wasn't use too before, it gave me a relief as i thought as this was my confirmation that maybe i was indeed straight.  after processing for a few minutes about what i had done and how i was feeling i left to go have a shower. once i had made it to the shower i realised i left my clothes in my room and so i had started making my way back to the room where i find the family friend that was over up near the door trying to listen in, not realising i was heading the room, he glanced towards me and with him maybe thinking it was too dark and late at night for me to see him he snuck past to quickly get to the lounge and fake sleep and act as though it never happened.

as i walked back to my room i had this bad gut wrenching feeling that i feel like this was going to be used against me, sure enough though, i never confronted them in the moment 

following weeks go by and now i have multiple ""friends"" and family of mine making jokes about me being gay or making certain ""gestures"" that only i could know what they mean because i ""used"" them on the night, as they do these things i get stares and small smirks, i know it's about me, so i finally stood up for myself.

i then began questioning every single person i knew about what they knew and if people were speaking about me, and every time i'd get the same repetitive response ""yeah sometimes, but nothing bad why"" and then i'd question that like what do you mean and it would be the same loop as to how it isn't that bad. i know it seems like maybe i was getting for far fetched and overthinking too much but i believe that there is no such thing as coincidences and after the years of manipulation and gaslighting my experience, i've come to the point where i genuinely feel like maybe i'm not good enough, maybe i am gross, maybe i should just leave. 

it's becoming to much and i don't know where to look for help, i've tried psychologists and doctors, i need something else 

also apologies if this reads bad, this is my first time publicly speaking on this

post_01504,"mental illness and too much stress - i want to kill myself hi everyone,

i've had really bad experience with reddit since it feels like whenever you aren't asking something very obvious and actually talk about your unique experience you get downvoted into oblivion, but nevertheless i'll try to explain my situation as honestly as possible so strangers on reddit might be able to help me.

i don't want to sound like a pretentious prick, but i actually think most would consider me in a good position in life - at least that's what everyone tells me. i'm young (16m) and have a bright future to look forward to. i have high grades (a+s consistently), a good sense of direction and maturity/responsibility, and i'm fairly socially vibrant. i also have a good career basically lined up with a full-time job offer in my country's federal government (originally an unpaid co-op/internship i did last year in 2024 but i have an offer to begin working in the spring when i'm wrapped up a few classes), and i'm graduating this year and will start university at 16 (i'm on track to getting my law license at 21 at this rate). i also work a decent part time job at a tutoring centre and i have a few (not many) friends i can occasionally fall back on.

however for the past few months i've been grossly unhappy to the point of being psychiatrically hospitalized with frequent contemplations of suicide. the counsellors and teachers i've spoken to have tried to convince me that stress is the root cause and i should simply scale back - what they don't know is that'd cause me way more trouble since i honestly generally find comfort in work. also trying to scale back at something which i've worked so hard to build and create would honestly be more disheartening. i do really think stress is a big factor but it's not like taking away the things i've worked so hard for is going to make me any more happier. 

for as long as i can remember i've struggled a lot with overthinking and anxiety yet i find nobody is taking me seriously whenever i try to seek help. whether it was writing homework or checking the door - i always double, tripled checked everything. somehow i've been able to get along fine in my life without it. however to be honest i've had instances of severe bouts of anxiety, depression, and paranoia. when i was 11 or 12 i freaked out after finding out a rare instance of canadian law which could make some of my favorite animes illegal (i thought i could have my life or my family's life could be ruined for child pornography possesion). when i was 13 i had a friend who expressed to me distressing thoughts and i freaked out thinking that something could happen with this guy and to me/family. today i constantly compare myself to others even to the point of irrationaility. for example, i frequently feel ashamed of myself and my achievements thinking everyone else is better than me - most of the time because they are 1 year older/ahead of me. even when i know they are older, i still second guess and start asking questions/googling around to the point that a lot of people think i'm a maniac. i've tried to tell myself i'm doing good and not to compare myself to others, but it's no use and i'm still losing my mind. recently i've been finding that it's been increasingly increasingly difficult for me to focus and do my work, and i might finish one class with a failing mark. a lot of people say i'm being burnt out and while that might be one facet of it, i don't believe it's the entire story and i don't know how to help myself.

post_01512,"today i realized that i'm probably going to actually commit suicide sometime in my life. it may not be today, tomorrow, or even 10 years from now, but i honestly think there's a 90% chance that the way i will end up dying is by killing myself. i've struggled with depression since i was 14. i've been making significant progress in therapy and i am the happiest i've ever been. but somehow i keep ensing up depressed and coming back to these thoughts.

i have a fear of being elderly and alone. i am divorced, don't have kids, and don't have many friends. i'm afraid of living in an old folks home and just being forgotten about. and then today i realized that i pretty much already am forgotten about. i moved across the country a couple years ago, none of my family or friends ever call me. my mom never calls, my sister doesn't call. the only time my best friwnd messages me is to complain about her life. she never asks me how i'm doing or what's going on with me. i'm always the one calling them, and if i don't we simply don't talk. it's like my fear of being alone has come true, the only difference is i'm younger and able to take care of myself still. i do have an amazing boyfriend, but lately i keep screwing shit up so i wouldn't doubt it if he left me soon too.

so ya. it may not be today or tomorrow, it might even be 10 or 20 years from now. but unless i have an accident of some sort this will probably be how i die.

edit: wow i can't believe how many people have the same thoughts and feel the same way. i'll try to reply when i can. it's comforting to know we're in this together. thanks for the encouragement everyone. it actually brightened my day a little. and please please don't hurt urselves. one thing that has made a huge difference so far for me is emdr therapy. i've tried all kinds and that one has helped the most. i still do have suicidal thoughts, but they aren't as often as they used to be, so that's good i guess. consider looking into it?",1

post_01531,"my despicable legacy. today, as 25th may i've decided to kill myself. not sure if it's because i've finally gathered enough confidence, or if it's because i finally understand things i didn't before. i do not seek help, however, attention would be nice, to be heard at least one time in my life; to finally show the world my most secret flaws, my archivements, the things i've accomplished, the bad memories, overall: to finally tell my despicable legacy. 

i feel invisible. 

i've been invisible my whole life. while never completely ignored, always felt invisible. 
i feel alone, even when i'm with the ones that are close to me; it is something i've been trying to stop for around 10 years, but finally give up.

at first, i was born as an accident, i've never been told that, nor made feel that way, but is clear that a mother who is 19, and a father who is 21, didn't exactly planned a child outside even a stable relation. 
i was lucky to be born in a somewhat rich family. i lived with my mother, her parents and my uncle until i was 5, then moved to a flat, with my mother and her new husband. 
from 0 to 4 life was decently good, i don't personally recall any bad experiences, but i was told recently from my grandmother that i would usually cry and reject being taken from my home to hers. i don't know why. 
my dad was poor by that time, he was still studying as a ecologist. he was present, to be fair, he was more present when i couldn't remember. 

from 5 to 12 i lived in the flat i mentioned early. i was there alone most of the day. now i think, what kind of parent would leave a kid alone in a flat at the age of 5? well, one that clearly didn't care enough. at 6 i joined school, the same monotous hell i assisted for 12 years. i never really fitted with the average person. i wasn't an outcast, or a creep, i had friends. they weren't good friends, but they were friends after all. we would normally go to each other houses and play together, watch movies, etc. 
i never did good in school, i barely did decent. parents reacted in the only logical way they could think of, by beating me. luckily my mother and dad broke up when i was around 3, so each of them went their way. 
my father never, ever hit me. he was a rational man who believed in dicipline through love, tho he never showed me love. 
nothing particulary especial happened from the age of 6 to 12, besides being bullied by some classmates; leading me to bully the ones who were weaker than me, which i completely regret. 

at the age of 10 this odd feeling started in my chest, some kind of void? some kind of sucking force that was draining my energy, my happiness and somehow, my willing to live. i didn't understand it. i had no idea why it was happening. suddenly, the world was no more love painted. a great hatred towards this new enviorement grew in me. to see everyone as an enemy. years later i understood that was when my depression began, my daily prison, the loneliness i feel every day; that was the starting point. 
at 12, i cannot recall what was in especific that made me cut, but something made me look for some kind of redemption in flagellation. i enjoyed it to some degree. i never did it to a serious level, and i stopped fairly quick, it only lasted for around 6 months. months of carving my hatred and depression in my horrible body. 
i forgot to mention that i've been called, or been made feel ugly my whole life, untill today. so a natural doubt about myself, and my body arise, and it's been here with me since so long... 

at this point i'm a bit drunk. getting everything ready for my departure, as i listen to there's no beauty left here, amazing album. 

sadly i never got hug any significant another, let alone kiss. i never felt the love of someone else, never got to cuddle anyone, to trust, to love, to have sex with, to share my thoughts. i've always been by my own, i've always been alone. what saddens me the most, is that i've never been heard. i've always been ignored.

invisible. that's what i've been feeling like for about 4 years. 

everyone around me gets talked by others. others interact with others, but not me. 
it covers many aspects, not only been talked but... i don't know how to explain it. i am a somewhat smart person, but sometimes i believe i'm really invisible? 
sometimes i talk to people in real life, and they just ignore me? 
philosophy has been an interesting topic for me, yet i cannot answer myself. if i'm ignored like that, am i even there? was i part of a community? 

but this is about the good things i did, too. 
i joined the fire brigade. had a good time there, it filled myself more than any other activity, i helped men, women and children. tho it was never enough to bury the loneliness and emptiness i felt. 

i also rescued a kitty that was pregnant! i called her mamou, she had 4 little kitties which i gifted to people i knew who would take good care of them. 

but it's been 2 years since i've been living on my own, mamou died 3 weeks ago, which made me realize the futily of life. but overall, made something a bit more clear for me. it wasn't hatred what i felt for the world, but disappointment. we've come so far as a species. we have so much potential, but it's been wasted, and me myself i am guilty of this. i haven't done anything remarkable. 
i am disappointed at the selfishness, the antipathy, the greed, and the distancing of humans. 

for those reasons i am sorry for whoever will have to clean my body, or cremate it? i am sure my parents won't want a funeral for me. i mean, even less with whats going on with the world right now 

that leads me to my next point, betrayal, backstabbing and abandon. that's what some of my friends did to me. they ditched me out of their lives like a spent torch, like a used tissue. 
sure, i did a mistake, i admit it. i did many mistakes. but looking at them in a objective way, is not much different of what our true nature is, in other words, i never did something worth abandoning your friend, and then getting them fired of their job.

quarantine is fucked up, makes me realize that the little chances i had of meeting someone before, now are completely gone. tho it hasn't been all bad, i got fit. i lost a lot of weight. i've read hundred of classic and cult books, same for music. 

anyway, to the last point. the things i most regret in life? probably not being more myself, that would have probably brought more pain, but it is uncertain. 
i regret never meeting and loving someone, it was harsh seeing everyone around me find someone, everyone but me. 

if you made it this far, i cannot properly explain how much i appreciate the time you dedicated reading this. this is more attention than all the one i've been given through my whole life. it felt really good to open up after so long

i am toms renard, these are the last words i want to say before leaving this world, and venturing into the next one. if anyone is concerned, know i will leave happy that at least read this post. i will leave with the only thing that has been here for me my whole life, a nice bottle of pipeo wine",1

post_01538,"i'm sick and heartbroken and depressed i'm sick. and i don't know what i'm sick with. i've been sick on and off for three years, but it's really bad right now. i can't do anything and everything is falling apart. 

i was making something of myself. spring of 2022, i started dating the love of my life. he was my best friend. i was living with my parents and he moved in with us for the summer. i was the happiest i can ever remember being. last january, he told me he needed space. it came out of nowhere and i felt so blindsided, but i agreed. i gave him space. but then he wanted less space. we were long distance and he lived a couple of hours away but before christmas we'd been seeing each other almost every weekend. after christmas i didn't see him until february. 

i was working on my masters. i was getting my life together, working hard. but my health started declining. i spent a month in january/february taking classes from home because i was too sick to make it to the school. i didn't know what was wrong. i still don't really know what's wrong. some things have gotten better and i've done some tests, but i'm so tired all the time. i spend most of the day sleeping and the rest of the day lying down. i get so dizzy and i keep fainting and my heart rate is constantly through the roof. 

my partner and i broke up in the summer of 2023. i thought i was going to die. i wanted to die. he'd told me i could rely on him, that we were going to get a house together someday, that we could get a pet. he told me  that he couldn't picture a future without me in it. he told me that he didn't know if he wanted kids, but if he did, it would be with me. but by the end, it was like he didn't care about me at all, even though he said that he did. he kept saying he would come see me, but he cancelled every time. even when we were breaking up, he said he would come so we could talk in person, but he never did. he told me i could talk to him about anything, but when i tried to tell him how hurt i felt, he blew me off. he never wanted to hear it. 

the final straw was when he said he was going to stay where he was the next fall and start a school program. he'd said we would discuss our plans together, but then sprung that on me. there was no discussion. there was no room for me in his life. i'd had this stupid dream that we'd be together that fall, that we'd make it work. but he didn't want that. he didn't want me. not badly enough to try to be with me. 

and i just keep getting sicker. it's been six months since we broke up and i'm supposed to be working on my final project for school, but i'm too sick. i've had to break my lease in my apartment and move back to my hometown, back in with my parents, because i don't want to take out more student loans if i'm not doing schoolwork and i'm too sick to work. i'm in my parents' basement, in a room that's mostly being used for storage, living out of suitcases for the last month. i'm trying to find a tenant for my apartment and i'm trying to take a leave of absence from school and i'm trying to make living here work. but i'm so tired. and everything is so difficult. 

and the worst part is that he's here. the program he'd been planning to do was in another town, but he decided to take a job here instead. he's living with my brother and his wife (they were all friends before he and i got together). he's just across town. but i can't reach out to him. i can't put myself out there when he's given no indication that he's willing to put in any effort for me. i can't open up to him only to be shut down again. 

he said he wanted to be friends but i barely hear from him. and i can't pretend that i'm not still hurting, that i have no anger, no pain. i can't just be friends and act like everything's okay. 

but i miss my best friend so much. i miss my boyfriend. i miss the love of my life. i miss having hope and excitement for the future. i miss having someone who loved me more than anyone, and who i loved. i miss feeling alive. i miss doing things and spending time with the people i care about. i miss having a purpose and drive and ambition. i miss going out with the dogs and hiking and going to hot yoga and dancing. 

and i hate it here. i hate this room. i hate that he took his stuff out of this room but he left his ex's stupid fucking wine rack that she didn't want. i hate that he's not here. i hate that every inch of this house reminds me of him. i hate that i've lost everything i've worked for, and i don't know if or when i'll have the energy to fight to get it all back. i hate that he's going to move on and meet someone else, and i'm going to be stuck in this basement, too sick to be wanted. i hate that i'm barely a person anymore because of this illness. i hate that he gets to have a life and move on and be happy. i hate that i'm in pain all the time. i hate that i'm getting fat because i can't do anything. i hate how pathetic i am. i hate pretending i'm okay when i'm not. 

and i'm not okay. ",1

post_01540,"anxiety flaring up during pms i'd appreciate women sharing their experiences and giving any tips or advice on this. if any gynecologist is out there who can tell me if it's normal, i'd really appreciate it.

i experience anxiety here and there, but sometimes it gets really bad during my cycle, i have clammy hands all day, random tremors, and palpitations. if you go through this, you'd understand that it can be really overwhelming on top of cramps and body aches. 

i have grown accustomed to random chest pains, but obviously, with all these symptoms during my cycle, it's just exhausting with added chest pains, overstimulation, rage that you feel for no reason, and tears just boiling up behind your eyes.

a few years ago, i was overcome with anxiety and depression which led to me setting myself on fire and jumping out through a window falling feet first to the ground. the pain was the worst i had ever experienced. my parents were there and rushed me to a hospital. i spent the next years of recovery in pain and having even more suicidal thoughts. i lashed out on my parents quite a lot. my body had 2nd to 3rd degree burns and i had shattered my left foot's bones as well as a mild lumbar fracture. which made me in a wrong state of mind at the time. right now all my burn wounds have healed and had surgery done on my foot; i've recovered quite a lot and have been able to walk without crutches for quite a bit. despite all the suffering i've experienced, i was able to get through it by having a talk with my family a bit and a few friends who visited.

but i think what helped me the most was being able to change the way i look at things. for quite a while, i had a very negative outlook on everything and would more often then not just give up or find an excuse/reason to hate something/someone; i would avoid thinking about it, to solve it, talk about it, or even ask for help. one after another all negative thoughts just kept on piling up on me. and eventually, i just snapped. right now, i'm doing better. i still have so much anxiety, maybe even more than before, and my heart aches everytime i think about what i put my family through that i often cry before sleeping. but i've become more open about my thoughts/feelings and have started being grateful for a lot of things; that i am able to focus more on what i want to do going forward. 

i still have suicidal thoughts from time to time and try my best to ignore it, but there are just nights were i wished i had died years ago. maybe i wouldn't have had to experience all of this, though i know it's my fault for just holding in and not thinking things through. i just hope for the best now and learn to live with all these scars i've given myself.",1

that caught me by surprise since i hadnt signed up to reapply for college (since i was already there). i had to sign up quickly, and luckily i made it to the second round.

i spent the last month thinking about how to gather the courage and find methods to kill myself in case i didnt get the spot, but i couldnt come to any conclusion.

**updated on 8/1/19**

i think i'll use my cake day to update this post.   i can not say thank you enough to the reddit community!!  for years & years i lurked on reddit. i read almost every single day, but i didn't participate much.  i had an old account for several years before i started this new one (which was supposed to be a throwaway account to ask a tricky financial question but i like the name.) as much as i enjoyed reddit i did not understand the spirt of ""the community"" until this post.  i could feel you all when i could not feel much else.  it was eye-opening and amazing and i will forever be grateful to each one of you.

i had more than 200 comments and about as many private messages.  it feels like those messages literally gave me life in the very beginning. i was careful to only read a few dozen a day, trying hard to make the comfort last as long as i possibly could.  i don't have words to say how much comfort i have received from reddit after this post.  i genuinely hope you never understand the depth of my gratitude because that would require you to understand the depth of my misery.  reddit to me was truly miraculous.  and because of you, i was going good!!  like really good!  everyone kept saying it was shock but i knew it was all the love, prayers, support and good thoughts that had come from this post that was keeping me afloat.  i am still positive that is the fact of the matter!

i was rocking widowhood until around week five, then it hit me like a freight train out of control. i completely lost my everlovn' mind.  i stayed slightly insane and more than slightly drunk until my doctor prescribed me an antidepressant about 10 days ago.  im starting to feel sorta human again.  well, human may be an overstatement but i don't feel like i'm completely insane anymore (although subject to change without prior notification.)  


when i finally gave in and went to my doctor it was because i literally thought that i had developed early-onset dementia. for real.  i was so worried about it for two weeks straight.  i just kept thinking omg this can't be happening!  our three (adult) daughters just lost their father and now they're gonna lose their mother to a memory care award or an insane asylum.  as it turns out (fyi tuck this away for the future just in case you might need this information,) but apparently if you only sleep for 2 to 3 hours a night for several weeks straight, you start to lose your cognitive skills.  i had no idea.  i genuinely thought i had gone insane.  

but back to you guys, i'm positive that without this post i could not of gotten through his memorial service.  i tried to write the eulogy for two weeks! i bet i started 60 times!  then the very night before the service (6/29) at like 2am i remember what i had written here.  i took the post, reworded a thing or two and added a bit more and voilà i rocked the eulogy.   

i made it through the whole service without shedding a single tear.  since it was going to be the first time i've met some of our employees in person i did not want to embarrass him by having smudged & streaked makeup  (not that dead people necessarily get embarrassed but you get the jest of what i'm saying.)  i think i would have made him proud. 


i can't believe i'm still standing to be honest.  but i've actually managed to work two whole days in a row!  like full days!  although our company has continued to pay my salary, i've honestly been too out of it to do much. luckily our two partners seem to be understanding.  

i am soooo looking forward to the day we are not every single thing reminds me of him!  tonight a quick trip to walgreens had me near tears because i saw candy corn on the shelf, it was the only candy he would ever eat and only around halloween.!  🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️

anyway, i just want to say thank you all so much from the bottom of my heart!!  you'll never know how truly grateful i am! 

*also for those wondering, since i did not know for certain when i first posted the coroner's report came in a week or so after his passing:  sudden cardiac event)*

                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


my husband died a few hours ago.  

around 5 p.m. on june 14th he went into the bathroom, locked the door and then collapsed.  i heard him fall.  i tried for a few seconds to get the door open but i couldn't.  i called 911 and they got here pretty quickly.   one of the paramedics kick the door in but it was too late.

we both have had some type of bug and had not been feeling well for the last few days.  he had taken some cold medicine so i'm assuming he had a heart attack.  i just don't know for sure.  he was only 57.

it seems strange that his passing would not be a big deal worldwide, like how is cnn talking about politics and not jeff?  the world has lost a truly great man.   a very rare man.  can't you all feel it?  the whole wide world is darker.  jeff was a good, kind, honorable man.  honest to god, he was the smartest man i've ever met.  he was was so sweet and tender-hearted. he loved me like no man has ever loved a women.  he was faithful and funny!! oh my goodness no one could make me laugh like he did.  he was the most quick-witted person ever.  he was a wonderful father, friend, cat daddy...even though he said he hated cats and was super mad every time i added one to the family, only to have him being the head snuggler in a few days.  i went through his phone and he had more pictures of our kitties than he did of even our grand babies. 

several years ago, him and his best friend started a company.  this left him interacting with the often ""chronically"" unemployed as well as heads of government. i always marveled he showed absolutely no difference in his interactions.  the homeless man applying for work was treated exactly the same as the mayor.  no airs, no pretension.  the moment he shook your hand, you were counted as a friend.  just honest simple kindness. 

he had a comfortable friendliness about him that instantly put people at ease. her also had an unexplainable air of authority about him.  people naturally just fell in line behind him.  he was a born leader.  people did what he told them to do, usually without question.  one story that always comes to m mind when i think about his seemingly otherworldly authority that left others comfortable and confident knowing he was in charge and he would handle it.  

recently we had a story in our local news about a child who lost a leg in an accident.   jeff donated the money to provide a prosthetic, on the one condition; you can't tell anyone where the money came from.  we are far from being wealthy.  in fact as little as 5 years ago we were nearly completely bankrupt after he endured a very long medical illness.  every single cent we had was gone.  all of our savings and retirement.  
during his illness his company took the first opportunity to let him go. he was sick and there we were without a dime or insurance.  
  
he got better then set out to open his own company so that he could make sure this particular job and community need was met.  he wanted to provide  the service with integrity.  he did.  by the second year in business he made more money than in the five years combined.  he was a work horse! he gave 200% to every single project and worked sometimes 18-19 hour days. he did it cheerfully because he knew he could help people.  he was such a blessing to everyone who met him. 

i'm a mess.  i'm so afraid and confused.  i don't know how to handle any of this.  he handled everything.  i had a rough childhood, early on it was if his mission in life was to make me happy. he spoiled me, not just with things but with himself.  in all of these years i can't think of a single moment in time that he did not put me first.  

i tried to always had to keep tabs on  him before i called him because i knew that if he was in a meeting or in the middle of a big presentation, it didn't matter if it was with the governor and mayor of the or any combination of bigwigs, if my number popped up on his caller id he would stop the meeting and take my call.   it was so sweet but it was also embarrassing to know you stopped and important presentation just to ask something as simple ""what would you like for dinner?"" i had asked him over and over again to just let my calls go to voice mail if he wasn't alone, even promising that if there ever was an actual emergency i would text him 911 first.  he still answered my call. it always made me feel not just loved but adored.

i called his closest friends to let them know.  i have literally heard more grown men openly weeping in the last day than i ever have in whole life combined.  i'm so afraid of a future without him.  he was my everything.  my whole life has been playing a supporting role to his ambitions.  i don't have any idea how to deal with the finances,  what to do about the brand new truck he bought six months ago.  i don't know what to do about anything and i'm so afraid i can't live without him. but mostly im afraid that i don't want to live without him.",1

i was sa'd by my grandfather july 2021, it completely ruined my life and my mental health is rapidly declining since. i don't talk about how i feel to people around me, that's not something i do. everytime i've reached out for help i've ended up in the hospital, which seems good yes, but i was naive to think they would actually help me. healthcare is canada, despite being free, is absolute shit. they just want to get rid of you as soon as possible, if they don't take you in anywhere you're going back home, suicidal or not. they don't care. i have bpd and every single time i've tried talking about my issues i've been straight up laughed at by therapists, doctors, psychiatrists and sent back home multiple times despite threats of ending myself, they blamed it solely on my disorder and brushed it off as an episode that would pass. 

my court date is coming up. i need to face my grandfather. it's gonna pull my family apart. my mom's side of the family and my mom (his daughter) doesn't believe me, despite some of them cutting contact with him, they defend him whenever they can, they blame it on alcohol or as a simple misunderstanding. it crushes me to see my own family invalidating the one thing that fucked my life up. once i go through with the court, which i don't feel strong enough to do, my grandfather is gonna lose custody of his handicapped daughter which can't function on her own. she needs constant care. the thing is, neither my mom nor my grandmother can take care of her. they're already overflowed with work which means they're gonna lose her. whilst i don't trust my grandfather at all to watch over her, i don't want to impose her loss on my family for something that'll ""only benefit me"" according to them. 

i feel terrible. i want to go through with it but at the same time i'm not. i've been waiting 4 years for legal action, i can't just give up now. i'm constantly stuck with going through with it or not. i don't even feel capable of taking such a decision. 

so yeah, my life is fucked, my health is declining, my court date is coming up in 3 months and rapidly approaching. quite frankly, dying would be such a relief. i know i won't thrive growing up as i have a chronic illness progressively getting worse which is extremely painful. since i'm not taken seriously, i can't get anything diagnosed therefore, no treatment. so i want a second chance, i want it to end. i'm genuinely extremely okay with going through with my plan to commit not long before the due date and i've never been so at peace with it.

i don't get why it should be up to other people to tell me to live. i know i'm unwell, i'd much rather stop suffering, this isn't living if i have to constantly try and survive.

the sound of my mom and my grandmother begging me not to go through with it constantly echoes through my head and it's eating me alive. i know that if i choose to go along with what they want, i'll live my life knowing he's free and thriving and i'll die regretting it. 

i don't know what to do. i've dealt constantly with crisis and quite frankly it's never been this bad. i feel it approaching like a deadline. it's rough to think i haven't got much time left. i wish i could tell someone. i don't wish for advice, i just want someone to be aware of my pain, even be it a mere stranger. at least someone knows. whatever you can say to me to convince me it's not the right solution, i've heard it and considered before. i'm ill, it's not worth the fight and i know it. i've known it for years, it's just so weird having so little time left after it's been nothing but an idea for so long. it feels so real. too real. i just can't wait to finally rest. i can't function anymore.",1

post_01575,"the logistics of killing yourself are so endlessly, frustratingly complicated i would literally attempt suicide right now if i thought it would work, but i just feel like i would just end up with permanent damage and be accused of being an attention seeker, when in reality, i just want to die quietly without any fuss. 

i hate hearing stuff like, *""if you fail, it's just a parasuicidal gesture""* and *""there are lots of ways to make sure it works,""* because sure-fire suicide methods are obviously not readily available to the vast majority of people. 

* do i try to poison myself with household products and probably just end up screwing up my organs?
* do i try to hang myself and risk brain damage? 
* do i jump off a tall building and freak out a bunch of people who don't deserve it?
* do i kill myself in the bath/pool and make everyone else feel weird about using it afterwards?
* do i lie to get a prescription i don't actually need and potentially get someone in trouble?
* do i gas myself and put others in harm's way?
* if i write a note, would that comfort people, or would it just make them feel like they could've ""done something"" and make it worse?
* should i ghost my friends before i do it to minimise the casualties? 
* is it better for my family/friends to find me, or some rando?
* what place/time would be best to prevent me from being interrupted?
* should i endure the pain and wait until i'm a bit older to kill myself so that i'm not seen as some immature, self-centred kid and people in my life don't blame themselves?
* if i survive, do i lie and say it was impulsive, and not like, years in the making?
* should i delete my sns pages and all the messages that i can before doing it?
* should i try between semesters in case i fail and need to take a break because i've messed up my health?
* would me killing myself destroy my religious extended family? 
* should i quit my job beforehand, or do i keep it just in case i survive?

there is no doubt in my mind that i'm going to do it, but i don't want to before i have a proper plan in place. partly to minimise the damage, but mostly because i'm just so very worried about the consequences of potentially screwing up. i don't even question whether or not this is what i really want anymore, it's just a matter or how and when. 

i wish this self-righteous society didn't censor 99% of helpful information that'll actually let me die instead of end up sick and injured. i wish i didn't have to feel guilty or selfish for wanting this. i wish people would stop spewing their spiritual and philosophical ideologies at me when they have f\*ck all to do with my personal situation. i wish people would admit that it's possible and even sometimes reasonable to want to kill yourself but not be depressed. i wish people would stop changing their tune about whether or not this will get better or worse with age when it's convenient for them. i wish it wasn't so hard and so morally taboo and so painful and so contentious and so risky to choose what i do with my own freaking life that i never even wanted in the first place.",1

post_01584,"""suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem"" i hate sayings like this with all my heart. people who say these sort of phrases have no fucking idea what it's like to be in severe pain. they have no clue whatsoever. they're either not educated on cases where people are in severe pain and don't respond to treatment or they just don't believe it. they can't believe life can be that bad that suicide is the only option. and it's because they're basing their views on their own experience. their own feelings and thoughts which aren't the same as people contemplating suicide. 

if people who say these bullshit phrases could just take a step back and think about things logically. for example, a person posts that they are going to kill themselves. they have suffered in pain for years, they are damaged, they've tried countless treatments with no response and every day is filled with pain. without the fortune of not being in their shoes, can they not understand why suicide is a viable option? even if you can't feel their pain, surely the facts can speak for themselves. you have to be a fucking idiot to read about a case like that and say to them ""suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem"" or ""we have to play the cards we are dealt"". 

do they really think that the suicidal person( after years of pain) is going to think ""this quote has changed my perspective entirely. i think i'm going to live now'"". whether the person intends to or not, sayings like this are patronising to people who have spent months or years weighing the options. i'm not saying they should just let them die if they've posted something like that. but patronising and bullshit quotes, when you can't relate, just makes me pissed off. 

although it's hard and the person just wants to post to let the pain out, they can't without receiving responses that make them feel patronised and stupid. in general i just hate sayings and quotes. they shouldn't be applied to be such a common thing that applies to everyone and every case. there's no right way to respond to someone suicidal, but saying quotes is not the way. best way i can think of is just saying 'i'm here if you need me for anything, if you want to talk"". i'm just a big believer in free will. no one should be confined to a life of pain.",1

my sister, later that day, *did* apologize (because mom told her to) but it seemed as if she wasn't even sorry. her ""apology"" wasn't even sincere. she was laughing, looking away, rolling her eyes, as if the whole thing was a fucking joke.

my mom told the both of us that the situation between us has gotten way out of hand, and wants to do family counseling. my sister started arguing with mom, saying how she doesn't want to make up with me.

so i asked my sister, ""why are you mad at me?""

of course, she didn't answer and ignored my question. i asked over and over again, but she didn't answer it.

the next day, i told my therapist that i tried to kill myself and she told me that i had to tell my mom. i told her, and she burst into tears. i also told her about all the hurtful things my sister said to me over the years.

mom: why didn't you tell me any of this?

me: i thought you wouldn't believe me, because you and dad always knew her as a nice person.

eventually, we had to tell dad about what happened. and for the first time, he cried. i've never seen him cry before. and it broke my heart to see my parents like this.

my mom scheduled a session with my therapist on 7/29/19 *with* my sister. but i'm worried that my sister will start lying to my therapist and will try to manipulate her to make it seem like everything was my fault. but my therapist says that she is trained to not fall for that, since she knows my side of the story.

i was told that her boss was going to be there, too, because she's only involved in a session if it involves *serious* cases, such as suicide.

post_01609,unsure. don't want to but also don't want to live.. i dont feel like i have any reason to live honestly. no one has really ever loved me other than family. i work harder than anyone in anyone's life and i just get discarded. i don't want to die but i don't want to live. i feel like im at the mercy of how i feel in the moment. just waiting for the moment when the overwhelming sensation takes over and i can't move on anymore. i just want the person that was here before she cheated. i just want that love that we had back days before it happened. i know life is hard and people change but your change was abnormal. your change i believe is more on your mental health than our relationship... maybe you're happier without me? if you are then why do you keep calling about things that aren't important? why is this happening? why cant we just work through our issues and love again?,1

i'm 26 and after studying and failing for 3 years i finally landed a specialty job that pays me what i feel is an immense amount of money. i skipped holidays, birthdays, almost everything to prepare for months and it paid off. i even stopped working out and basically just dedicated all my time to this.

i've tried and failed this multiple times and i finally got it.

i even negotiated hard after getting a great but lower offer. i was very nervous but i knew what i needed to do.

it's fully remote, has great benefits and it will change my life. i am beyond happy but i don't want to tell anyone how much they actually pay me.

post_01624,"i feel that the least selfish option i have is to rob a bank. i (27m) am loved by my family, i think. i have some friends. but as i stare at my ceiling for the nth night in a row, i am left crushed by the weight of existence.

i know the answer is in the simple and unexplainable things: friendship, love, the way the sun shines through my blinds in the morning, the outdoor cats i sit with in the parking lot, the 'good morning's of the people at the gym before the sun rises.

work no longer feels fulfilling, hobbies don't scratch the itch, multivitamins and exercise and hydration and getting out of the house only take the edge off anymore. i am deeply, deeply alone. there is only so many times i can call the crisis hotline before the amount of resources i am using outweigh the potential societal benefit of me continuing to live.

nobody reaches out to check in, even those that i reach out to, to check in on them and just chit chat about whatever. it has been over a year since someone reached out to me first or invited me to anything. 

if i were to hurt myself, people would be surprised and devastated and with the way i feel about my place in the world, any amount of honesty on the way out would do more harm than cause closure. i would not leave a note.

i'm in therapy, i try to make friends and maintain the friendships i have, i'm on medication, i have a job, i have hobbies, i eat okay and i exercise, but i have no meaningful direction or purpose in life and waning hope for a future. i don't know where i belong. i don't know where i am or where i'm going anymore.

so i am left thinking:
if my suicide would be selfish, and i am continuing to just tread water while sinking further, then wouldn't the best thing for me to do be to take myself out of society and into a controlled environment? the last thing i want to do is hurt somebody else. demanding a dollar from a teller and sitting outside until i get arrested would really only hurt me and my future. i don't want to be a burden on the taxpayer or on society, but more than that i don't want to be my sister's brother who just couldn't find a way to live anymore.

it was all a mistake. the universe was a mistake. i would erase everything if i had the infinity gauntlet, i would. without a doubt or hesitation. it would spare trillion upon trillion of sentinel beings. ending everything would be an act of pure empathy. no amount of happiness can out way our suffering and inevitable death. how could any god create this place? is he dumb? does he not care? is he dead as well? fuck him or her or it, whatever the fuck it is. how could it?

 i cannot see the bright side of life. there  is no bright side without ignorance. my ignorance is long gone. i challenged lifes values and looked into the void, and now i wish to have no part of life troubles. i wish i could erase myself. i want to be free from the shackles of life.

so much suffering for no reason.  over a million suicides per year. cancer. heart disease. stroke. diabetes. the list goes on forever, and for what? nothing. to end up in the dirt, slowly eaten by bacteria and maggots. what a cruel joke.

i wish i killed myself at 15. i truly do. would have spared myself. i should have finished resident evil 4 for the last time, ate two chocolate donuts, jacked off and blew my brains out. i should have. nothing was worth it. like cioran said, you always kill yourself too late. he was right.

i don't want to grow up,i don't want to be a productive member of this life cult. i don't want to be a so-called adult. i refuse all of this. i want out. let me die. i refuse all the responsibilities  that were forced upon me. i don't want a job. i don't want to pay taxes. i don't want any of this shit. leave me alone or let me die. 

i hate it here. i hate humanity. we've created a world that breeds isolation and loneliness. i hate being alone. nothing matters alone. i wish to be loved. i wish to be cared for, validated, nurtured,held,loved. i am a human with needs not a cog. i want to matter. i hate it here. i hate all of you. love,love,love. i don't know anymore,i don't feel anything anymore. why do i keep writing these posts? why bother living. why why why why why why. why won't anybody love me? why? i just want to know. 

i've grown completely apathetic towards everything. nothing seems to matter. i cannot grasp the feeling of joy. do i even mean these words? or am i just miserable? i don't know. i wish i had someone to talk to. i wish i could look someone in eyes and receive the warmth that i crave so much. i never mattered. where do i go? what do i do? who do i call? i have nothing. i crave nothing more than a deep emotional connection with someone but i despise majority of humanity. now what? i don't know. i'm so tired. so tired.

this is it. it's only going to get worse. isn't it? i wish someone loved me. maybe then  i wouldn't think this way.",1
post_01651,"im sorry guys. im sorry everyone. tonight is the night. it was meant to be this morning but certain plans didnt work out so i have to visit all my friends today instead. im gunna be giving people small things to keep because i dont like the thought of my family doing one of those this-is-how-he-left-it things, its just feels like they would hold on too much. thank you for all you kind messages and comments, and please dont hate yourselves if you tried to help me but couldnt. im very useless when it comes to the help of others actually helping. im asking a girl i really like if she would just want to lay down in bed and hug, as ive really missed that human connection, but even if that does work out and we spend hours there hugging and talking, im still going to end it, because fuck the way my head works. thank you guys. i havent said this to anyone but my names josh, idk why i feel like i should mention it but idk man. good luck to you all, and hopefully i wont be in pain for long. 

i will always miss you my love.

edit: ive been inundated with messages that i appreciate so so much. im still here surprisingly, i honestly thought i wouldnt be by now. 

edit 2: hey guys, thanks so much for everything youve all said to me or messaged me, i really appreciate every single one of you. im sorry i havent replied to some people, but ive read every comment and theyve helped me so much. ive decided im going home tonight. im giving myself another two days, and if i feel ok, another two after that. i hope everyone here can ask her the lo and help each other. i love you all 

edit 3: hi everyone, i want to thank you all so much for everything you guys said, its nice to know there are people out here that feel the same way, and im so awestruck by the help that you guys are also giving each other in the comments. the best description i could give right now is that my environment is still sharp, and everything i come into contact with hurts no matter the slightness of it. im still very very disregulated (not sure what the proper term is) and im finding it very hard to control the many impulses i do have. i havent been able to leave my room but ive still gotta go another day. i didnt put it in my post but i suffer from bpd, so anyone else who is feeling like i am please read the comments. they are for you too, and anyone else who wants to take their own life. i might not end up making it much longer, but like i said im the previous edit, im going to give myself two days at a time, and if that doesnt help just a day. if i dont, please take this a pertinent reminder to reach out to absolutely anyone when you need help. seek medical advice if you cant protect yourself, and always be kind to others. yeah you may have bad days, and you may hurt people that you care about, but those bad days dont make you a bad person. i love you all so very much, and if i could take away the pain that you feel, i would in a heart beat. 

edit 4: good luck everyone. i cant do it. i hope all your lives are full of love and life. i really wish i was better but im better off dead. if my family ever see this i love you more than anything on this earth, and i wish things could have been different. im not going to rely or activists this account anymore as i dont want to be stopped. thank you to everyone for their kind words 

edit 5: got taken to the hospital by police, family came and picked me up. i may get help soon but i dont think it will be for a while. im going to keep the post up but i wont respond to any comments. im sorry i cant keep coming back and feeling the same. thank you for all the help, i hope i can get past this.",1
post_01652,"whst a life this is. so, i'm 17 now. everything feels so different and the same, i still feel like i did when i was 12 during peak covid, i'm laying in bed every day doing nothing but it had real consequences now, i'm close to being kicked out of college because my attendance is so low and honestly i don't care. i'm clearly not okay and it feels like nobody is noticing, my sister recently got diagnosed with cancer and i want to be there for there because she's going through so much, she has two kids and i want to offer to babysit but i'm so unreliable, i skip out of plans like they don't matter because i can't bring myself to get up. last year i got so close to ending it, i told my mother, she kept pressing and pressing when i sent her a long text telling her exactly what i needed from her in that moment but she basically ignored it. then in november i actually tried and it was pathetic, i thought i could jump into a river and it would do most of the work but it didn't, it was waist deep, i just stood there and then had to wade through the water to get out, it left me aching and so, so cold. i got home and had to lay under my blankets for hours so i didn't become hypothermic and it was pathetic. my room smelled like mildew until i could bring myself to put the clothes covered in the much from the river into the washing machine. i'm starting to turn to substances and my mother is helping me indulge in it and i know it's wrong but i can't bring myself to care, she says i can smoke or have weed because she's scared of losing me, she doesn't know how to help and it's damaging but at this point i feel like i need to get high to make it go away for a bit. she took me to the gp the morning after the night i told her i was going to end it and the guy was nice but not even he could do anything, the youth service said two years ago i've done everything they could recommend and they accepted that self harm was just something i did. the man i saw in the gp said i most likely couldn't get onto antidepressants until i was 18 because they can make teenagers more suicidal but i honestly don't think i can be more suicidal at this point. i need help and i've exhausted all the resources. every day it gets harder and i'm just doing nothing, i can't go to college without pain, any amount of light gives me migraines, people on campus won't stop meowing at me or asking about why i don't use my cane on campus and it's exhausting, i have to wake up at 6 am to go at 8 am to college and i get home at 5 which doesn't seem like a lot, especially for people with full time jobs but i can't handle it, i come home in pain and exhausted, i can't even use willpower to get myself to college every day, when i was going in the first term, i had 100% attendance for the first two weeks and even then i was planning what days i would have time to shower, wednesday's are half days so usually i'd shower on wednesdays and monday mornings and that's it, i feel gross and disgusting for it but at this point, i've attended college twice this year and i haven't showered since then, i'm disgusting and i hate it but i can't even bring myself to take care of my hygiene or anything, i've had two of my molars surgically removed already and i'm still not brushing my teeth, i haven't gone outside, i don't know if i nescaserally want to die but i do know i don't want to live like this. my ex who i never properly broke up with started dating someone else and unadded me on everything when we were actually on good terms. i have a few friends in college but i don't know if i can even keep going for them, they're all so nice and they deserve to be happy and i can't stop thinking about how much it would hurt them if i was gone, one girl i talk to most is so nice, whenever i'm in college she talks about how she missed me and it makes me happy that someone cares but i also want to distance myself from everyone so it doesn't hit so hard if i do end up gone forever. last year i got the confirmation that my hospital can't do anything else for my eyes and they've steadily been getting worse, my nystagmus has too and it's exhausting, i can't sleep and when i do it's always too much, i stay up for days and sleep for twenty hours, i want to tell someone, to get some kind of help but i've lost hope, i've already been failed multiple times already. i don't want to fail myself by giving in and letting go of everything i've been working so hard for. i never got my gcse's because my attendance in secondary school ended up being 0.05* in the end. my college attendance is 43% and there's always a meeting lined up about it, they're going to kick me out and i won't have a path to follow anyone and it's terrifying. i'm scared of growing up because i was never treated like i would, if i didn't make an effort to make myself look as unique as possible, the only thing people would look at me and see is my blindness. i want to be someone and i'm afraid of the very real possibility that i never will be. i lost my binder a little after christmas and even though i don't use it all of the time, it was oqe if the only things that made me feel more comfortable and gave me agency over how i looked. i'm so scared.

sorry for the rant and i'm sorry if it doesn't make sense, i'm not thinking straight and i don't know what to do anymore.",1

post_01655,"can't die yet. gotta wait for my amazon package. i've spent the last month or so thinking about being dead. but of course i couldn't just up and die. christmas was around the corner, and i had so much shit to wrap, so many appetizers and cookies to make. plus dying before christmas is kinda rude. death doesn't make for good dinner conversation. so i didn't die.

and now it's after christmas, but i still can't die. i have an amazon order for my stepdad's retirement dinner. it's just a $8 coffee mug, but i have to wait for it to arrive so i can fill it with jelly beans and give it to him this weekend.

then the weekend after that is my brother's 21 birthday. sure as fuck can't die before that. what a shitty way to spend your 21st birthday. and the weekend after that my other brother and sister (the twins) are turning 18. i planned on making my sister some cute jewelry, so i still really don't have time to die if i actually intend on getting that made.

and then it'll be my birthday. the big 3-0.
thirty years of being, well, me.
thirty years of waking up each morning, stumbling through the menial tasks of living, the mundane gruntwork of keeping body and soul together, of maintaining healthy relationships, of planning for the future, of eating, breathing, shitting, and going to sleep each night.
thirty years of fuck-all. 

but i can't die today. i have to pick up orange juice and bread from the store after work. there's still laundry to do. the dishes are still soaking in the sink. and my amazon package hasn't arrived yet.


edit: y'all have been wildly supportive, and i just want to say that i'm grateful for all of the people in this sub who are willing and able to be vulnerable about their mental states. it often feels like drowning in deep water, and i'm glad that everyone here today is still fighting the undertow. keep treading. grab onto any lifeline you can find. even if it's just orange juice and an amazon delivery.",1

post_01659,"early 30s, female, no friends, no connections, no intellect, no attractive physical features, learning disabilities, mental illness, tons of debt, and no college degree--an impossible rut. i understand if u want to scream at me to stop whining but i have nowhere else to turn, no way out of this rut. at this point it's slowly becoming a matter of when i kill myself and not if. any helpful advice out of this rut, (since outright asking for suicide methods isn't allowed, although any suggestions for a painless suicide are much appreciated and welcomed) would be greatly appreciated. 


currently, receiving  any mental health is near impossible because my health insurance doesn't cover any resources in (or remotely close) to my area, (and i can't afford the funds to travel out if i had to).


  out of despiration,
i turned to god in my darkest times, who continued to promptly ignore me **and actively made things worse immediately afterward.**    felt like i prayed to demon or something. so turning to god/faith is absolutely out of the question. i'm done tearfully pleading my case to the ceiling.
 

living each day is like a chore. it's not living. it's nothing but soul-crushing days followed by sleepless nights. self confidence? never heard of her. if i had a clear path out, i'd do anything i could not to be me.


i know this is feverishly written, and probably makes little-to-no sense, but my mind and emotions are spiraling.

my point being, something that would make me happy would be becoming a fire fighter, at the moment i cant apply to the academy, but i can apply to be a volunteer paramedic. now comes in my problem, with my medical records i might not be able to apply because most psychologists wouldnt give someone like me the sheet that says im mentally able to do this. this also means i wouldnt be able to get the same sheet so i could go to the academy.

post_01689,"trapped in a life i dont like i will be quick. i've been bullied a lot growing up, from classmates, family and even teachers. i think that's what lead to this overwhelming waves of emotions i get and that make me desire death. i cant get rid of what i've been bullied for, simply it is part of me. i could get it surgically fixed if i had a ton of money but i dont. honestly tho, i understand that is not the reason i got bullied, it was an excuse. just like any other could have been. 

despise knowing this i cant help but yearn for death. i hate being trapped in the same skin and body i got so much made fun of. some days i dont go outside coz i dont want to be seen. its been almost 10 years with this kind of thought and knowing that i probably cant heal and that i cant die either makes me suffer even more. 

my parents want me to have a family in the future but i dont want to pass down my genetic curse. if i had a kid and she came home crying into my arms i dont think i could ever forgive myself. 

i still get comments from strangers about my appearence and it's so humiliating to not being able to change. 

the only plausible option is that i have trauma regarding that, hence why i cant seem to move on. i'd like to die but a few friends made it clear that i would be missed, i also watched some documentaries on families who lost a family member coz of suicide and i just cant! i just dont want anymore pain, i dont want to cause any but i'm so tired!

the only thing that helps me calm down is knowing that my body is healthy and i am able to experience life with very few limitations, in other words, i'm lucky. besides a few moments where i feel blessed i just cant help desiring to die. i would love to change, i am hopeful that maybe i could one day be free from this but i am so lost, idk where to start. maybe i only need to focus on being here right now. honestly i have no idea.",1
post_01690,"what kept me going for 6 years ive been suicidal since i was 14, and i even tried to do it once. once that failed, i realised that most of the problems in my life weren't because of me. they were all somehow linked to something other people had done. 
at that point, i got angry. realised that not only did those people ruin my life, but would also get further satisfaction when i die. because they kinda won ykwim. i hated them so much, i decided to live out of spite. 

i decided that i would claw my way out of the hellhole i was in, take what was mine and more, and get something good from the universe. i would do whatever i can to surpass the people that ruined my life and look down at them. and if i die before i get to see their disgusting faces all weak and sad then i'd never forgive myself. 

a very sadistic way to go on indeed, but it might work for some people. worked for me. 

if you don't have loved ones if you don't think anyone is worth living for in the good sense, live to see the people that ruined you, fall. live in spite, then work it all out in therapy later. ",1
post_01691,"how do i get people to take my si seriously? hi. i'm 17, and since i was 12/13, i've had mental health issues regarding depression and anxiety, and i also have hf autism.

 when i was 13 i told the school counsellor that i had suicidal ideation, and was taken out of school and put to online school, and move in with my grandparents so i could be watched. despite this, my parents, and entire family really didn't take it seriously. i'm separated from my dad so i don't see him often, and he's not really involved, but my mum didn't believe that i was suicidal at all, and just thought i was trying to get out of school. 

after this, i'm now 17, and have struggled with depression throughout the years, however no one notices, or believes anything. they attribute my behaviours and feelings to being emotional, hormonal, or being a bad kid/person. 

i'm at the point where, i truly believe i could attempt if i find the means. how can i help them realise, and save me? i don't think they care about me enough in the first place to bother, but it's possible also that they're too afraid to let themselves believe i'm suicidal and have intentions to go through with it.

i'm also on day 17 of lexapro(escitalopram). i don't know if this is whats causing the suicidal thoughts or not, but it's getting worse, and i just wish someone would take me seriously. 

i don't know what i should say or do. i'm scared i will stress them out if i tell them, even if they don't take it seriously. so maybe i should just do it, and then they won't have to bother any longer.

i had a reasonably dysfunctional adolescence and young adulthood. was oppressed and depressed. looking back, both my parents had un-diagnosed mental disorders as did both my siblings. my father was eventually diagnosed bi-polar. i had one suicide attempt at 15 that was a close call. i later joined the military and had one more close call with a firearm and another full attempt with pills. 

around this time i started drinking heavily. the underlying depression stayed but acute thoughts of suicide went away. i also had some messed up experiences in the military, so, i continued drinking until a couple months ago. complications of drinking almost killed me and i ended up in the hospital. i quit drinking but suicidal thoughts appeared immediately after i detoxed.  it's been going in waves of a couple hours or a day or two at a time. not just hopelessness but deep nihilism. such as feelings of, ""humanity is doomed"", ""we have maybe 5 years left, tops"". i have not felt this way before and i don't know what to do.",1

• call your girlfriend the wrong name and see what happens
• record your boyfriend whilst you answer a fake facetime from another guy

with that said, i think i'm just done with life. it's been building for awhile and it just keeps building. it doesn't have much to do with the coronavirus or the riots but those have been the final straws. the coronavirus has taken away my ability to even attempt to make new friends, try new activities or even do things i enjoyed like traveling and playing tennis. luckily workouts have resumed in my state so i can do that. the riots have taken away my love for sports and history. it seems like everything i love slowly but surely is being taken away from me by various forces.

even the activities i enjoy i don't enjoy as much as i used to. i feel like all they do is temporarily dull the mental and physical pain that i now feel constantly.

the coronavirus has shown me just how hollow and empty my life has become. god is definitely not in my life and i am angry at him for various things (that i'll get into here in a minute). i am single and i have no kids or even pets to keep my company. while others at least had family to keep them company i've had no one. this coronavirus pandemic has officially isolated me. most of my family live in another state and i would be hesitant to travel for fear of getting them sick. plus my nieces wouldn't see me anyway, they've bought into all the fear.

i have failed so often at dating it's become comical. i decided to get back into dating with stuff opening up. i went on a date on tuesday that i thought was going well. we played mini golf but then, according to her, her perfume started messing with her allergies. we didn't have any food or drinks after the round as she felt like she needed to go home. i contact her thursday where she tells me that she's been seeing another guy for awhile and that they have decided to be official and she wants to see where it goes. needless to say i sent a nice little message to her, nothing rude but telling her i thought it was pretty low to have gone on a date with me knowing i had no chance. like so many other times in my dating life i just felt used.

besides being single with no kids or no pets i don't have a lot of friends. the few i do have know i struggle with depression at times and really do try to help. they all think i'm a very good guy who's just had bad luck and they truly believe i'm a good guy who deserves love and happiness. i just don't know if it's in my cards at this point.

besides that my body failed on me pretty early. i'm 35 but my body started failing on me around 30. always had high blood pressure that was hereditary. now i'm slightly overweight, have hemorrhoids occasionally and also suffer from allergies and eosinophilic asthma. i was on a flight to nashville back in 2017 (2 hour flight) where my throat really dried out. i started to panic which then caused my asthma to flare up. no medical emergency but it was a horrible flight. now my doctor has me take a xanax 0.25mg tablet before the flight to relax and a prednisone 50mg tablet to control the asthma. it's worked but whereas i used to love flying i now dread it. i feel like it's destroyed my ability to travel, i don't want to fly for longer than a few hours. but there's so many places i've wanted to see. i've asked my doctor about it and i've asked a pulmonologist about it but they don't seem to take it seriously. i think they think it's all mental for me at this point. ever since i became afraid to fly it's destroyed me a piece at a time.

so besides my body betraying me my mind has betrayed me as well. i know i've suffered from some anxiety like i mentioned but even my therapist won't officially diagnose me with depression. my mind is always half empty and i think my physical conditions have caused my mind to deteriorate.

all in all part of me truly wants to believe in reincarnation. that we get multiple chances at this life and that i'll just get another chance. i know christian religions don't believe in reincarnation but it's one of the few things that gives me hope. i will say this, i think god made a mistake having me be born during this time. i believe i was born in the wrong time.

i have a job that's a good job but it's ultimately a dead end job. i've never been one who had that light click on in terms of a passion. i've always been adrift in terms of what i want to do. yes i have a bachelor's degree with a double major in management and marketing. i also have my shrm certification as a certified hr professional. but if i'm honest i don't have a passion for any of it.

so my personal life is a mess. my physical health s\*cks, my mental health s\*cks. i don't have many friends and my dating life is an absolute failure. i feel like a lot of my passions are being taken away from me one by one. the coronavirus is going to make it impossible to make new friends. the riots have shown me that a lot of country hates me for my very existence. they hate me just for being a white conservative male.

i am a walking contradiction. i don't want to die and don't have to guts to but i've lost most of my will to live. i've wasted my youth, my best days are behind me and not in front of me and i no longer have any zest for life. deep down pretty much nothing makes my happy anymore. sure some activities dull the pain temporarily but i've lost the ability to feel happy. i've lost the ability to connect with people. i've lost any ability to have empathy or compassion. i just feel like i don't care anymore.

i don't know what i'm asking for out of this, i just had to finally get it out. i really don't know what to do at this point. if i could i really wish there was a ""do over"" button that we could press and start again. i wouldn't make all the mistakes i've made in my life. i would try to not be so da\*n introverted when i was younger which made it hard to make friends. i would've traveled the world before my health made my ability to travel by air an iffy proposition. i would've tried more activities to maybe find a passion.

i don't anymore guys. it just all feels so hopeless. if i had to use one emotion to describe myself at this very moment i think that's the one i would use. hopeless.

post_01729,"anxiety around eating dinner/eating out (tw: eating disorders/gi disorders) several month ago my gi issues that i have had for nearly 20 years increased along with stress related to work for the past 4 years (too many requests not enough time to get everything done perfectly). at first i thought it must be a recurrence of my gi issues that were dormant for 10+ years. then i began to connect the dots that a huge project was kicking off and more was just coming down the pipeline at work around the time my gi symptoms reappeared. 

over the next few months i had 2 really bad incidents where i had to tell my partner we needed to leave the restaurant we were at because i was having a bad gi flare (nausea, lower gi cramping, and other unpleasant symptoms that remain nameless to protect the innocent). these all resolved each time i returned home and took pepto-bismol. so, i was not ill with a virus or food poisoning etc. after my gi issues reappeared, i did follow with my primary care provider and also a gi specialist at a major medical center 3 times. both have been helpful. however, with the high stress and the resurgence of my gi issues, i am beginning to think that perhaps i was developing an anxiety loop of ""well if i eat this will it make me sick?"" nonetheless, i soldiered on and my lower gi symptoms go better, but around october i began to experience stomachaches around dinnertime every day and lost my appetite for the most part. i unconsciously just didn't eat enough at dinner and subsequently lost 15 pounds when i randomly decided to weight myself in mid-december because my clothes were fitting looser. the 15 pounds of unintentional weightloos freaked me out. so, i contacted my gi doc thinking that there might be more than just feeling a little anxious about eating dinner. 

i was tested for a few things that my gi doc thought it might be, and we also discussed my stressful work and that i was going to be transitioning to a new position in mid-february. so, his thought was, lets have you see a gi dietitian and wait and see if your stress levels decrease. in the interim, he asked me to try and track my instake which i was doing anyways and aim for 1800 calories per day using ensure plus to supplement as needed. i am usually hitting around 1800 per day and have not lost more weight. 

this is where it gets weird for me, since december or so, i have noted that i no longer desire to go out to eat in restauants or in front of others for fear of if something might make me feel unwell. just last week i cut my lunch at work short because i was so anxious with all the other people in the break room with me that i had to leave and again talk myself off of a ledge (i was hot, stomach was doing flip flops, and i felt like i as cramming food down my throat even though i did not eat that much).  over the weekend while going on an overnight trip to visit friends, i had what i would call a bad anxiety attack in a restauant at dinner. i had to excuse myself and go to the restroom to use the facilities because i was so anxious and talk myself off the ledge before i could eat barely half of the sandwich i had orderd (it was good too!!). 

i'm at a point where i am seriously worried that this will escalate further and then what? i have not seeked professional help with the anxiety aspect at this time, but i am seriously thinking that i may need that kind of assistance, and i should reach out for a referral from my medical team as this is just insane. the logical side of my mind is like this is not difficult and what is wrong with you, you need to eat and the emotional side of me seems to be locked into if you eat dinner you're going to be unwell and you're going to embarass yourself having to leave a restaurant early. it is so frusterating since eating out was a huge part of my life for a long time and i feel like i have lost that part.

post_01731,"after smoking cigarettes for 17 years, today marks the first week that i've went without smoking any cigarettes i don't have a lot to be proud about. i struggle with depression and anxiety. a lot of the time i don't feel like i have control over myself, especially over my compulsive addictions. 

quitting smoking has been difficult, but it's made me realise how powerful i can be. i never thought i would go this long without a cigarette, but somehow i managed it. everyday it got easier and easier and now i can proudly say i don't even think about a cigarette when i wake up, or after a meal. i've finally got the monkey off my back.

more then that, it's changed the way i feel about other stuff. challenges or difficulties seem less daunting and unachievable. it's like i've unlocked a part of my brain that i didn't know existed. i still have bad habits, but now i feel like i have the strength not to let them control my actions.

post_01735,"finally getting therapy in the morning after 8 years of abuse i left my abusive ex bf (my child's father) of almost 8 years in october. this man was an absolute monster to me. i still have days where i get flashbacks of things that happened that i tried to forget. not a person in my life knows how bad the abuse was. i made a list of things he did to me that i still stayed. 

-cheated with multiple women (i caught him f*cking another girl in my bed when i was at work)
-drugged me(i have never took drugs or even been drunk before)
-raped me after he drugged me. (i couldn't function but was still aware) 
-constantly took money from me
-was physically abusive (at first he was apologetic but after awhile he didn't even care)
-gave me an std (not curable)
-screaming and cussing almost daily over the smallest things.
-would take the keys to the car when we fought 
-broke things in the house when he would rage
-told me he would have the courts take our child from me because i have anxiety. even though the anxiety stemmed from the way he treated me. 
-constant remarks about my weight and or appearance 
-very controlling on how much money i spent or what i wore
-took the money his family sent for the baby's christmas gifts and spent it on himself
-told me that i was the ""only one who wanted that baby""
-made jokes about f*cking my mom and cousin.
-would always start fights when i was at work
or with my family. 
-took money that i sent him to pay our bills and spent it on weed 
-would rage out when i found his stash of pills when cleaning
-made fun of me on facebook and wouldn't add me as a friend or put that he was in a relationship 
-never let me have his phone password and would start fights when i questioned his activity due to his past infidelity's 
-he would buy himself takeout and bring it home while me and my daughter ate the low cost meat i could afford.
-driving recklessly when he got mad when i was in the car. 

there's a lot more but that is the main things i can think of right now. this man is the most terrifying human i've ever met. many of his coworkers loved him. nobody knew how bad it was. i was terrified for me and my daughter and i'm thankful we're alive. trauma bonds are really hard to break and i never thought i'd leave. i have my first therapy appointment in the morning and hopefully it goes well.

forewarning:
long story/rant since this has been bothering me for the last couple days and i feel like i'm going a little insane since it seems like i'm the only one who thinks it's kind of a big deal

tldr: my friend seems super lonely and also kind of depressed but nobody else seems to really care about it except for me



last weekend, i went out drinking with a couple of friends. it was a great night; went to a couple clubs, met some new people, watched my single friends talk up some girls, watched my taken friend get yelled at by his girlfriend for something he didn't do. overall, a fun night with no hiccups. 

at the end of the night, all of us except for my taken friend and his girlfriend ended up crashing at a friend's place. everyone was pretty much passed out drunk, except for me and a guy who i will refer to as k from now on. 

i've only known k for about 2 years now and met him through a mutual friend who's known him for like 10 years or so. we're all in our mid-20s so it really wasn't so difficult to get close with these guys, but k was always kind of a little different than the rest. he wasn't ever reclusive or anything like that but i only really noticed this last week that i really do not know anything about this guy as a person. i knew how other people saw him and other surface level stuff like what he does for work and who he hangs out with and things like that but i literally do not know anything else.

anyway, while everyone else was pretty much passed out, k and i were the only ones still awake. it was around 4am and i was texting my girlfriend still drunk out of my mind while k was probably the most sober out of all of us even though he had gone the hardest the entire night. he's always been insanely strong with alcohol and drugs and stuff so i never really thought anything of it. 

while i was telling my girlfriend about the night, k got up and started cleaning up. bottles, food, plates, garbage, just the usual stuff. thinking back now, he's done this every single time i've seen him after we got drunk for the night. i even remember one time he woke up in the middle of the night after getting absolutely piss drunk just to start cleaning up while everyone else was still trying to survive. i've asked him and our other friends about it before and all of them have said that that's just how he's been for as long as they've known him. k told me he just does it because why not. it was a little weird to me but i never complained about it because having someone clean up afterwards was pretty nice to have. 

anyways, while he was cleaning, i mentioned it to my girlfriend on the side as a joke that the night was officially over because k started cleaning. my girlfriend joked back saying she'd come over right away to keep the party going. k heard it and laughed mentioning he still had half a bottle of hennessy for the 3 of us and for my girlfriend to pull up. 

this was when i kind of asked a joke question, asking why he goes out of his way to clean up every time when we could just get our other friends to do it so that they could make themselves useful for once. 

k responded saying he does it so no one else has to and it was like something in brain just flicked on. 

for as long as i've known k, he's been the go-to guy when it came to handling other people. he would preemptively offer rides in case people couldn't find one, offer to pay for people's food and just have them pay him back later when they could afford to, take care of people who got super fucked up during raves and nights out and parties even though he would get super fucked up himself. the thing is i've never seen anyone ask him to do any of this. even right now as i'm writing this i realized how much money i probably owe him in gas and food and drinks. and he's never asked for any of it.

i don't know why but i suddenly felt so bad for him that out of nowhere i him if he was okay. he replied the way he usually did which was laugh, smile at me, and then say could be better, could be worse. 

i followed up with something along the lines of ""for real are you okay?"" 

he instantly looked away and just said ""no but can't do anything about it so we keep going"" and then kept cleaning.

it was quiet for a little bit after that until i got a text from my girlfriend who was still on call with me. she basically just told me she was gonna mute herself but stay on call and that i should ask him all the questions she was about to write out to me.

now, my girlfriend has known k for way longer than i have and we basically only got together because of him so when she told me to ask the questions she wrote down that's when i realized that this dude really doesn't talk about himself.

it was mostly questions about how he's feeling and a lot of it were repeat questions worded differently. stuff like ""how are you feeling right now"" and ""you can talk to me about how you're feeling"" and ""if you want to talk about anything i'm pretty good with stuff like that""

he didn't give any actual substantial answers for most of them until i straight up just asked him ""why do you do the things you do?""

he said ""i want to be everyone's last resort""

this phrase has been what's been fucking me up the last couple nights. usually people want to be the first choice and k was literally the only person i've ever met who's said something like that. and i genuinely believe him.

when i asked him to explain what he meant by that he said something along the lines of how everyone needs someone and sometimes some people don't have someone. naturally i followed up by asking him if he had someone like that. without missing a beat and without even looking my way he said ""i hope so, but it's okay if i don't because i'll be that someone for me."" 

after this we didn't talk anymore and i ended up asking my girlfriend to pick me up. 

the last couple days i've been going around to mutual friends asking about k and the general consensus ended up being jokes about his alcoholism and drug use. i would follow up asking if they seriously think he had problems with that stuff but everyone just said probably not and that he just likes to party. still though this has been bugging me nonstop. 

and then just last night i asked my girlfriend to tell me more about him and during the whole thing she told me that he tried to kill himself 3 times in the 7+ years she's known him. and apparently the only reason she knows is because he'd offhandedly mentioned it to her after they'd gotten super high because it was part of a story he was telling. 

i've been so angry and hurt and sad because of this and i don't know what to do. k is 100% the nicest guy i've ever met and it's not even close. and it's not one of those weird overly nice kind of vibes. he just seems to be genuinely himself and everyone around him seems to love him because of it. he's a good looking guy, super fun and outgoing, and he takes care of everyone. every time we go out there's at least 1 girl who talks to him and they always seem to hit it off but despite that he never gets with any of them. i've asked him about it before and he always just says they're a great person but he's got someone else he's into. i even had a phase where i was worried the girl he was into was my girlfriend and i confronted him about it but instead of getting mad at me for being insecure he just told me everything about the girl he was into and who it was. he even apologized to me for making me uncomfortable enough that i had to confront him about it. this was almost a year ago now.

i honestly don't know what to do with how i'm feeling anymore because no matter what it feels like everyone has kind of just brushed it aside saying that's just who he is. but to me it's starting to feel like he's super lonely and depressed and he does everything for other people. nobody could even give me a proper answer for who they thought his best friend was. it's like this guy is just a ghost to everyone except he just likes to party. 

i don't know if im just overthinking this or what but it's really been fucking me up and i just needed to let it out and maybe someone can just tell me straight up if i'm being stupid about it or not

depression can't even be cured. people say it's ""not logical"" to kill your self, but it really is for me at least. it wont get better. depression can only be suppressed. i'll have to live with this horrible pain for the rest of my life. and the things in my life that make it worse are even more unbearable because they'll never go away, no matter what some fucking stranger who doesn't even know what i've been through says.

the reasons behind it are :

(1) when i younger, i've been sexually harrassed by 3 people, one was my classmate, one was a teacher, one was someone from family

(2) i've been bullied alot. upto a point where i have scar on my cheek and left arm, when i was a kid... they even tried to threw cement in my eyes, i got lucky that i didn't got blind... even the teachers bullied me.

(3) i, before puberty used to be really cute and pretty... problems were there with me then too but not as much... rn all i have is ugly face, scar on left arm and my cheek. not a properly formed ribcage... the feelings of inferiority never ends when i'm around others. but what really makes this worse is, everyone one else in my family is pretty and have a normal body. so i feel like an outcast among them.

i liked being sad thinking of her. i liked the moments i looked at her eyes and wondered how could pair of eyes be so beautiful. maybe i didn't love her maybe i loved the idea of her, her presence, her charm and just her. 

well that would be the last time i write about her or think of her. i would try not to blame myself for every night i spent awake thinking, wondering and having insomnia but yeah there's nothing i can do now it's done for me and i can't talke it no more.

i'm not really looking for a ""see your therapist,"" i'm looking for genuine perspective. this is also sort of a vent post, so if you don't want to read that scroll on. i'm just kind of looking for help from people who are older than me and have lived to see more than i have. 

i think at this rate i'm giving myself heart problems due to the amount of stress i've put myself under, and i'm just kind of scared. i'd like to preface this (as i mention a few times later as well), by saying i'm not su*cidal and i am safe. i have mental health issues (anxiety, adhd, autism) that are managed with a combination of therapy and medication. 


some background: i'm 26, going on 27. i'm from the us. i have a relatively stable job that i've been at for about 4 years. in a few months i'm finally moving in with my partner of 3 years. i should be relatively happy, but i'm not. 

i'm in a constant feeling of existential dread, and i don't really know what to do. people tell me not to watch the news, because it just scares me, but i feel like if i don't, i won't be informed, and that just scares me more. everyday, i watch the president slowly close in on making our country more facist. it scares me so bad. i've tried to disconnect from politics, but it's not something i can really do either. i feel like any day, everything is just going to close in on me, and my life is going to end - and that's terrifying to me. 

i'm scared of the world ending. i'm scared we're going to go to war. i'm scared of climate change. should i run to canada? i don't feel safe. even as i'm typing this my heart is racing. 

i've been in therapy for several months now and i've found some coping mechanisms that seem to work - but i always end up back here. at this rate, i'm going to end up with heart problems, or gray here, by the end of the year. i just feel so hopeless. 

i am trying to find the right words to describe how i'm feeling. is this a midlife crisis at the age of 26? i lay awake at night, most nights, until 2-3am, in just pure anxiety. i feel like i'm dying soon. i know everyone is just going to say that it's my anxiety, but i do feel that way. it's something i can't accept and that's why i just keep going over and over it again in my head. 

do i delete tiktok? shut off the social media and world around me? everyone says taking a break is what would be best for my mental health. but the idea of not knowing, is the idea of what scares me the most. i don't know what comes after ""the end."" i've been dreading it since i was a small kid. maybe it's a phobia? i don't know. i don't really know anything. 

i want to have kids with my girlfriend but i'm afraid they won't have a good life because of climate change. there are people online who say the end times are coming, but there are still people who stay on the positives. i don't know how i can trust either of them. 

i'm getting older, so are my parents. it's terrifying. i can't sleep at night knowing i'll be without them and the idea of living away from them makes it even worse.

i'm terrified of moving to a state that people are saying won't be there in a few years. i'm terrified even with the houses being built well, that we'll end up de@d under the rubble there. 

i keep thinking i'm getting better but when i'm sitting here, typing this at 3am, i don't really think i am. nothing is getting better. i'm so tired of crying and living with this feeling of dread all the time. i feel like no one gets it and just blames my anxiety for everything. 

i can't bring myself to find joy in anything, when it feels like i might not be here even a year from now, that i'll be dead. 

i'm so insignificant. there's only a few people that would even miss me if i'm gone. in the grand scheme of things, does it even matter? is this floating rock going to even be here in 10 years? what's the point of it all? why even bother keeping going on when it's all just going to end anyways?

i'm too scared to k!ll myself. i'm scared of the unknown. no matter how many studies or anything i read on it, it never makes me feel better. i've tried to educate myself with science or get into religion, but i haven't been able to be religious since i was a child.

is anyone even out there? is someone watching out for us? 

if there is, why can't they just let me stop feeling like this?

i look older, especially the last few months. i'm surprised i don't have gray hairs. i probably will by the end of this year, honestly. i know i look older because of my mental health.

it just keeps getting worse, my mental health. this stuff is weighing on me so much i feel like i can't breathe. i'm just waiting for the day i stress myself out to death, because that's where it feels like all of this is going. maybe then, when i'm de@d, i won't feel so worried and panicked all the time. 

like i said, i'm too scared of the unknown to actually k!ll myself, but i can't help but feel like i'd finally have some sort of peace. 

i'm not su!cidal, just really really tired. 

a part of me thinks that i'll d!e within the next year, and that i should start writing goodbye letters now. not with the plan to end it myself, but planning for an inevitable end i see in my head. 

but really - would it even matter anyways? 

i want to show this to my girlfriend, to my parents, to anyone who will care - but would it even matter? would knowing that i'm grappling with this when there's nothing they can do really mean anything? 

i think i'm just beyond help at this point, and maybe i'd be better in an institution. at least there i'd be safe and looked after. clearly i can't look after myself, i can't even keep my house clean. 

i don't want to pay for an institution. 

would it even matter if i'm so sure i'm going to d!e soon?

does anything matter?

do my words matter?
 
do i matter?

i don't. it's just really really hard and tiring to accept that i'm nothing but a blip in the universe. 

and i'm just really really tired.

writing out my thoughts was supposed to make me feel better, but it just made me cry more. 



i guess i'm just asking for advice at this point, to people who have lived through this. how do you find meaning? how do you cope with knowing that it could end any day? how do you live your life?

i could really use some advice, because i haven't slept in a while because these thoughts are keeping me awake.

i might post this on a few other reddits for advice. i just really need help. sorry if you see this more than once.

post_01774,"i don't care if i'm loved if i can't feel it. what if someone kept feeding you sugar or something saying it was good and so sweet and glorious but you had a phsyical issue that negated your sense of tasting sweetness? you never tasted the good, just the grainy painful shit like sand that never nourished.

that's how i feel when people say ""don't go, you are loved.""

i know i'm loved.

i know its sugar.

i can't feel it.

i can't taste it.

the only reason i stay alive when people say ""you are loved"" is guilt. isn't that fucked up? you're guilting me into suffering more because that makes you happy somehow? either find a reason that makes sense to my brain or turn your back and let me fucking die already!",1
post_01775,"struggling to find a reason to keep going lately, i've been feeling like there's no light at the end of the tunnel. the weight of loneliness, rejection, and self-doubt has become suffocating. it's like i'm drowning in a sea of despair, and there's no one around to throw me a lifeline. the thought of just ending it all has become a constant companion, whispering in my ear that maybe that's the only way to escape this never-ending pain.  i've tried to reach out, to talk about these feelings, but somehow it feels like no one truly understands the depth of my despair. every day feels like a battle that i'm losing, and i'm just so tired of fighting. is there anyone out there who can relate? someone who knows what it's like to feel like there's no way out, like the darkness is consuming you from the inside out?  i just need a sign, a reason to keep pushing forward. but right now, that light at the end of the tunnel feels so dim, almost out of reach.",1
post_01776,"help how do i stop being so scared of speaking up in meetings at work or just having the fear of getting ideas rejected? i was in a bad toxic work environment prior and it has affected my confidence even in my new role in a healthy environment. i always have to rehearse what i am going to say even if it is something small, and am terrified of the day i will have to run a meeting or get up and present.

post_01777,"i hate how, since we were young, society has engraved on us that we should have our lives figured out on our 20s. i've been living like a robot these past few days and i've been telling myself to numb everything so i wouldn't get hurt. how nice would it actually be to not think and feel at all huh. it doesn't help that the people around me see this robot as a 'strong' person who can stay composed at the face of adversity. i'm not strong and i wish i can just yell it out but that would cause more pain within the family that would only end with one affected party, which is, *surprise surprise,* me. i don't have my life figured out at 20 and my mind is very persistent in chasing this hourglass time limit of succeeding in life. i know and understand that we all have our paces and that nothing is ever easy in life but why won't this mind just stop thinking. even as i'm writing this my heart is doing its thing and it just hurts.",0
post_01778,"feeling lost and overwhelmed lately, i've been struggling to find a way out of the darkness that seems to have consumed me. it feels like no matter how hard i try, i can't shake off this heavy weight on my chest. the loneliness creeps in, and it's suffocating.  i look around and see others living their lives seemingly without a care in the world, while i feel like i'm drowning in my own thoughts. the pain of past traumas haunts me, making it hard to see a future worth fighting for.  every day is a battle against my own mind, against the thoughts that tell me i'm not good enough, that i don't deserve happiness. it's exhausting, and i feel like i'm running out of strength to keep going.  i long for some relief, a moment of peace where i can breathe without feeling like i'm being crushed by the weight of the world. the idea of ending it all crosses my mind more often than i care to admit, and it scares me.  i know there are people who care about me, who would be devastated if i were gone, but the pain feels unbearable. i'm lost in a sea of emotions, trying to find my way back to shore, but the waves keep pulling me under.  i'm reaching out here because i don't know where else to turn. i need help, i need a lifeline to hold onto when the current gets too strong.",1
post_01779,"i see a lot of posts about people being anxious because of politics. here's a good reminder of how the media accentuates fear. as the title explains: ""i see a lot of posts about people being anxious because of politics. here's a good reminder of how the media accentuates fear.""
charlie brooker; how tv ruined your life - episode 1 of 6 - fear: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqebcvhha9m

it highlights how the news, the media, etc. has been talking of the end of the world and various dangers, many of which never came to be, for a long, long time. it does this in a funny way too, which, from an acceptance and commitment therapy perspective, acts as a defusion intervention, helping you to reframe apocalyptic media happening now, as being in the same ongoing theme of: 
""look, look at this dangerous thing. you're in danger. give us money/clicks/likes/attention.""

post_01782,"i'm lonely but everyone disappoints me i wish i had good friends but people have disappointed me a lot. i've tried many times in many ways but no one seems to care for me as much as i do for them. they just use me and after that starts to humiliate me because i'm ugly, short and dumb. at this point i've stopped trying, i don't want to be in a darker place and drama. but i'm so lonely, i hate seeing people hanging out while i'm here, sitting by my self. i literally give my everything, i put so much effort in every relationship but everyone fucking leave me or use me. as an ugly person, i've realized that personality doesn't matter, people lied, everyone goes for looks even in friendship. no one accepts me for who i am, i feel sad.

post_01785,"wtf is the point im not really depressed, but lately i've been seriously contemplating suicide.

though im not depressed my life is pretty shitty. i have no friends, a toxic family, we're borderline poor, ect. i have no joy in life. i have no motivation.

i have nothing to look forward to. i have no dreams or aspirations, im not good at anything, i have no idea what i want to do in life. im too awkward to get anything done or get a relationship, i simply can't picture a future where i'm happy.

so with the combination of a shitty life now and likely an even shittier life in the future wtf is the point. i have nothing and no one, i used to be so optimistic but now that me is nowhere to be found, i genuinely dont think i'll make it through the summer. i have a plan and the equipment only reason im still here is because my parents don't know shit about taking care of a dog",1
post_01786,"a cute comic today. it came with the tagline: '""oh, don't cry"" – proven to stop all crying, 100% of the time' I saw this comic today and it really touched my heart.

post_01789,"lost in the darkness  i feel like i'm drowning in a sea of despair, with no lifeline in sight. each day is a struggle to find a reason to keep going. everything feels heavy, from the weight of my thoughts to the emptiness in my chest.  i've been battling these demons for what feels like an eternity. the loneliness is suffocating, and the pain is unbearable. it's like i'm stuck in quicksand, sinking deeper with every passing moment.  i've tried reaching out for help, but it feels like no one truly understands the depth of my suffering. the smile i wear during the day is just a facade to mask the turmoil within me. i long for someone to see through the charade and offer a glimmer of hope.  the thought of ending it all lingers in the shadows of my mind like a siren's call. the idea of peace in death is both terrifying and alluring. i crave the stillness that comes with oblivion, where the noise of the world fades away.  i'm tired of fighting a losing battle, of pretending that everything will be okay. the fear of the unknown paralyzes me, but the thought of continuing to exist in this agony is equally daunting.  i know i should hold on for one more day, but the thought of enduring this pain for any longer feels unbearable. i'm lost in the darkness, desperately searching for a way out before it consumes me entirely.",1
