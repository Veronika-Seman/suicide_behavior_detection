I did not go CT. CT with loperamide high doses is actually hellish. I don't advise it. I tapered down from about 70mg a day to 0 over the course of about 45 days.\n\nThe taper was honestly pretty easy. I kind of naively assumed when I jumped off from low dose to 0 it wouldn't be a lot different. Not the case. Once I dipped below 12mg or so (around the limit for actual CNS activity IME) it became very noticeable.\n\nTo be honest the symptoms are not like, *unbearable* or anything, but the possibility of them lasting up to two weeks is really stressing me out. I've seen many accounts online of acute WD from loperamide lasting this long.\n\nI do have some gabapentin on hand that has been a god send for sleeping. It would seriously be challenging without that. But I have to do some normal life stuff during the day and I can't just load up on gabapentin and pass out for the next 10 days.\n\nMy original DOC before loperamide was PST, and with that you could really feel the WD creep up to full strength by day 3 and then start to subside. I don't really feel that way with loperamide. It feels like a more constant around the clock malaise that feels not very different day to day. That's what's kinda freaking me out about the potential for a long acute phase.\n\nRLS, yawning, muscle aches, and extreme lack of energy are the biggest things hitting me now. I think the character of the symptoms is changing a little bit day to day but it's really hard to tell.\n\nI know I'm probably in the thick of it right now and I'll start to feel some relief in another 5-10 days maybe, but it's just feeling a little despairing at this point in the process.",

I've deleted all my dealers numbers so I don't really have access unless I started trying to track people down in person. I am having surgery Thursday but I assume they'll give me 5 or 10s. Someone else will be taking the script anyway so I don't have access to them. I justified using by patting myself on the back for getting to 24 days and since they'll probably give me morphine during surgery anyway. I know it's stupid but the crippling lack of energy and anxiety coupled with knowing I have one more to give me relief tonight. And although I do feel way better, I immediately regretted using right after I snorted it. I've let so many people down that I promised I would never use again. Even though no one knew I had a problem when I was using daily. I decided to come clean to have some accountability. Obviously it's different for anyone, but please tell me I didn't set myself back to the beginning. I know I probably won't have acute WD like coming off the 300mg a day habit, but as far as PAWS, energy, depression and anxiety. Am I basically starting from scratch again?

I‚Äôve actually gotten some insanely good advice and I‚Äôm feeling way calmer and better and more clear about what to do. Seriously thank you opioid recovery community! You‚Äôll all be in my prayers \n\nHello, basically I'm 21 female my bf is 22 male and we have been together for 5 years. For our entire relationship we have been using drugs and alcohol but for about 2 years now we have been on a sobriety journey.\nI somehow managed to not get addicted to anything except nicotine but unfortunately he got addicted to being intoxicated in general. Constantly looking for the next strongest thing. An issue we often had was that he couldn't ever just be okay with being baked. He always had to be the most intoxicated he can possibly be. He became badly addicted to hash and weed. Which was one hell of an issue on its own, then out of no where he became addicted to spice. It was to the point that he got caught at work, left uni and lost his job and is now doing out patient rehab once a month. (The rehab place is super full so he can't meet w the therapist more than once a month) he's on sleep medication and mood stabilizers now. Me and his family finally found a rehab place for him after the worst paper bender he's had so far. It was a month long and absolute hell. So much screaming and crying for him to stop. If ur not familiar w spice it's basically up there w the really hard drugs. The come down is horrible and so are the withdraws. And the high is insanely strong. When he's on it he's basically asleep or out of it completely unable to speak and unable to function for days or weeks at a time.\nAs his girlfriend I really do not want to leave him. He's the love of my life and I don't have the stomach to leave while he's in such a low point in his life. Honestly he doesn't deserve for me to stay with all he's put me through (not just due to his addiction) but really I just don't see my self leaving him any time soon. I try to just be there for him and give him the love and support he needs but this time l lost my mind. He was sober for a month and was finally past the worst of the withdrawal. He was sleeping and eating again. Then he relapsed. And it's been almost 2 weeks now that he's been on spice daily. I don't know what to do. I lost my mind. I screamed and swore at him which is insanely out f character for me. I've never sworn at him like this before. I told him how he‚Äôs not just failing him self but he‚Äôs also completely fucking up my life. I have no friends and a shit relationship w my family. And it all comes back to him. I told him I can‚Äôt deal w this much longer and that I‚Äôm close to being done w this if he doesn‚Äôt stop. And basically I‚Äôm at the brink of hurting my self or loosing my mind completely. I don‚Äôt know how to deal w this. I‚Äôm just a 21 year old girl. Nothing in life prepared me for this. I need help. Please help me. If anyone has any advice on how to help me finally get sober please tell me.  ",

    "selftext": "So I‚Äôve managed to make a little less than one gram of fetty last for 7 days by taking it with me to a place i knew I wouldn‚Äôt be able to get anymore and basically rationing it equally per day in a way that would make sure I don‚Äôt run out during this time away. So at this point I‚Äôm using 0.10 gram a day which im pretty sure is the lowest daily dose I‚Äôve ever been able to taper down to. Normally a gram I could stretch to like 2.5 days, so half a gram‚Äôish a day. I don‚Äôt know how big of a difference this would make when it comes to kicking it entirely and getting clean (again‚Ä¶.for the 6th time in less than a year). I was clean on and off for like 3 months right before this but just kept having mini lapses or big lapses and of course that led to full blown relapse, which has now lasted 3.5 weeks. It‚Äôs not super long time, but my clean time during these last 3 months was also very shakey, 10 days here, 2 weeks there, 5 days, etc etc. (starting my clean count AFTER the acute WD‚Äôs have subdued mostly) but all those times were never long enough to get through and to any sort of significant clean time which is why I think the goosebumpy skin and some sudden hot flashes would still occur randomly and basically would persist well after the worse of the acute withdrawal phase and never fully went away.\n\nIn any case, 0.10 sounds like such a low dose that I really wanna tell myself I can just jump off at this point but part of me is certain I‚Äôll still be in full hell and just as bad as if I were using 0.5 grams and I just don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm physically or mentally strong enough to go through it again right now, especially given I would have to do this alone, my family are far far away now which was not the case before, they were there and I had some support (although they didn‚Äôt know what was happening, they just thought I‚Äôm sick), and now I‚Äôm living in a big empty house on my own, no partner (divorce in process, which is a good thing i was unhappy, and it‚Äôs issues unrelated to drugs, red flags started showing before any addiction and I didn‚Äôt get out of this relationship in time), and I have my dog to care for who I love dearly and he has gotten used to me always doing my best with him and giving him all the care and activity he ever needs (3-4 hours a day minimum) and I know that in the past I‚Äôve been bed bound for at least a week unable to do anything for neither myself or him, outside of taking hot showers frequently and crawling right back to bed and laying there awake not getting a minute of sleep during that first week which makes me half delirious half crazy half losing my mind (that‚Äôs three halves, yes I know the math doesn‚Äôt math but you know what I‚Äôm saying). \n\nAnyways I‚Äôm just at a loss. I could try jumping off but the stress of thinking what hell i could potentially be in, is just making me too anxious and pushing me away from even trying. I also know that I need professional help because I have gotten clean before and detoxed at home on my own* and ended up relapsing every single time so it‚Äôs time to try something else and get support/help because i clearly am not successful attempting to do this alone every time (* i detoxed both with comfort meds and sometimes without any, and sometimes with megadosing vitamin c protocol which has helped tremendously at least during two of the times I detoxed but not every single time, sometimes it literally made no difference, so yea, it really depends on what the substance I was using was cut with on the streets - unfortunately, so it‚Äôs unreliable as a method otherwise I would 100% do it again and know it won‚Äôt be bad all). \n\nI‚Äôm now going back home where I know I am able to score more so the whole rationing and tapering and making sure I dont run out will no longer be a thing so I‚Äôm sure my dumb ass will go grab more because I‚Äôm just too scared of having to do this again and alone at this point. I have a lot of self control if I‚Äôm in a situation like this past week where I know I only have a certain amount and if I run out I‚Äôm screwed. I‚Äôm sure a lot of people are like that. The only next thing I can do to taper even lower than where I am right now is to basically stop using until the physical symptoms are unbearable and wait until I feel like  absolute horseshit and in full blown withdrawals‚Ä¶but, since I‚Äôm home now and know where to get more, this whole tapering and low daily dosage has very low chance of succeeding. And I hate myself for it. As an addict I have no faith in myself to actually do the very last bit of this taper and only use when I‚Äôm in withdrawal hell. I don‚Äôt want to kid myself thinking I‚Äôll have the discipline to do that and I‚Äôm so so frustrated. I guess it doesn‚Äôt matter because at the end of the day I will relapse again unless I make some major changes in my life and get myself back on track and in an enviornment that makes me excel and focus on positive things. I know what changes need to happen for me to get on track again but unfortunately they won‚Äôt realistically happen for another 3-4 months, just because there are external factors impacting my living situation and constraining me to stay where I am (the divorce and legal process is pending and huge part of it and there‚Äôs not much I can do to speed up the process so I can implement crucial changes like moving away from the isolated settings I‚Äôm in). If I try to jump off and not much else changes I‚Äôll relapse and I‚Äôm not going to lie to myself about that. I have a decent diet and I am physically active daily as is so implementing those kind of changes isn‚Äôt exactly needed since I‚Äôm already doing that when actively using (if that makes sense). Could I be more active and do 5-6 hours of physical activity per day ?sure maybe, but it doesn‚Äôt seem like a realistic expectation. Otherwise I am hoping to spend more time on getting a job since I‚Äôm not currently working (left my job right before divorce shit started and have been drowning in my own sorrow and haven‚Äôt focused on finding a new one yet). So that‚Äôs what‚Äôs thing I‚Äôm hoping will change within the next 3-4 months outside of everything else, but again that‚Äôs something I can‚Äôt completely control and I can only hope putting a lot of effort into my job search will pay off and result in a job. \n\n\nAnyways. I don‚Äôt know what the point of this post is. I guess I‚Äôm just depressed and on a flight back home having all these thoughts spinning in my head. I‚Äôm exhausted from them occupying most of my day every day, I just want OUT of this grave I dug myself. I‚Äôm just too mentally weak and easily breakable with all the shit I‚Äôm dealing with currently. I know self pity isn‚Äôt gonna get me anywhere but I can‚Äôt stop crying these days. It‚Äôs pathetic and yet I still can‚Äôt stay clean no matter how miserable I am when I think about how stuck I am in this cycle. And every time I look around at other people wherever I am, it feels like the demon of addiction is the worst problem a person could struggle with. I try to imagine what strangers around me are dealing with and no matter how shitty of a situation I picture them to be in, i always find myself thinking how much I wish I could have their life and deal with that issue instead of opiate addiction (which originally started with me self medicating severe depression and major ocd‚Ä¶so yea there are of course the underlying issues that for me here which no therapy has helped me resolve successfully). Yes I know there are indeed people with way harder problems than me, but it‚Äôs easy to feel that this life crushing addiction is the worst thing a person could ever deal with. Self pity galore, I know. \n\n\nThat‚Äôs all I got. Again, just wanted to get my thoughts out somewhere where people could/might understand what I‚Äôm saying.\n\nStay strong everyone üí™üèª ",

    "selftext": "Hi all, I'm just looking for advice here. I have a friend in another city (\"Don\") who struggled for years with heroin use. In the last few months, Don said he had successfully switched to Suboxone but had become homeless due to his family kicking him out. Privately, three old friends (including me) tried our best to help him get housing and medical care, but it didn't actually help. Now he is making very emotional, desperate, and sometimes untrue Facebook posts asking for Venmo money for food and housing.\n\nMy question is: is it right or wrong for me to note on Don's Facebook posts that he has, in fact, gotten a relatively large amount of money from people privately? \\[Edited to add a couple sentences:\\] I have \\*zero\\* interest in shaming him. But Don is also saying that nobody has helped him, while these three friends recently sent him well over $2,000 in the space of two weeks for food and a deposit/rent for an apartment that turned not to exist. I'm sure at least some of this money actually went to heroin, because two of Don's dealers told me so. I'm worried that friends giving him money for things that 100% are not real (like the apartment) is deepening his health crisis and could lead to an OD or even worse alienation from his family.\n\nI've had several one-on-one convos with him about his Facebook use. But they haven't had an impact--for instance, Don recently posted a picture of himself with a dog and said he'd adopted it and needs money for veterinary bills, neutering, dog food, leashes, etc. I know for a fact that this is not Don's dog. I know the dog's owner (the picture was old). I'm concerned that posts like these just activate a new set of friends to send money that may just fuel an addiction that appears to be killing him. Maybe it's not my business. But Don's physical presentation has deteriorated in a shocking way and I'm very worried for him.\n\nHonestly, in this situation, would it be better for you for other people to know a fuller version of the truth (that he has, in fact, been sent money) or not?",

    "title": "Finally, The Much-Anticipated Light at the End of the Darkest Tunnel I've Ever Traveled",
    "selftext": "At 22 years old, I tried heroin out of pure curiosity and an immediate inability to find/procure methamphetamine. Upon snorting dope for the first time, not only did it give me the exact every I felt from stimulants, but it was accompanied by a general all-around feeling of happiness, contentedness, and well-being. Naturally, I wanted to feel like that all the time, especially in a life so constantly overrun with stress, anxiety, and unnecessary bullshit. But, 14 days later, you wake up one morning feeling sick, and when the only thing that makes you feel better is a nice fat ticket of that tan powder, the realization hits that well shit, I seem to have developed that dope habit I said I could avoid.\n\n13 years later. A ticket a day turns into 10 grams a day. What once was a practice of \"cut up a line, sniff that shit, and wait for the relief\" became a routine of \"powder, water, filter, draw it up, find a vein, and send that bitch hoommmeee!\", and way too quickly, I might add. What once was a substance that brought me unending pleasure no matter how down I felt, was now a demon that seemed only to serve to bring me down and down and down, even when I thought the pit couldn't get deeper, even when I thought what was dark couldn't possibly get any darker. The only pleasure remaining from heroin was the initial feeling gotten post-injection, when the withdrawals recede into the far depths of what was and you finally dont feel sick. Even if the garbage actually managed to get me high, literally every minute of the experience would be me focusing on how shitty my life has become; how disappointed I am in not only myself, but the choices I've made and the path I followed; the fact that I devote every single bit of my being (every waking minute, every penny in my pocket, every planned action and every question posed) to maintaining a relationship with a demon in disguise; a demon that at one time led me to believe that this alternative sensation was fine and dandy, only to unmask itself to show that, underneath, it is only here to literally drain me of everything I am, everything I have, and everything I could ever be. What once was a strong being of positive morals and grand ideals, was diminished to a weak heap of decrepit bone and flesh, unable to exist without that ruthless succubus at its side. I couldn't ever imagine having the strength to rid myself of that horror, and feared that, as long as I continued to survive, legitimate happiness and joy were things of the past; things that I would never, ever again be able to experience without relying on foreign chemicals to get me there.\n\nThen came November 20th, 2024. Three days prior, I began feeling an odd ache in my right ankle. It almost felt like a sprain except, oddly enough, it started in the middle of the night, while I was sleeping. Three days later and the ache is now an agonizing, immense pain in my ankle AND foot. I cannot walk on it; the swelling so severe that any hope of comfortably fitting any shoe on said foot is none existent. After finally coming to a somewhat-awake-and-oriented being and power-shooting the last of my stash with the slim hopes of providing myself with even the slightest pain relief, a friend of mine gives me a ride to the hospital (luckily, the best hospital in the state of Maine, and one of the top hospitals in New England). \n\nNow, I'm a tough cookie, and after over 12 years as a homeless IV drug addict, there really isn't much in the universe, in terms of pain, that can even phase me. But, in the ER, upon being admitted to the hospital, the collar of my hoodie was SOAKED from tears due to me absolutely bawling my eyes out, the pain was legitimately that intense. In three hours time, I was dosed with Oxy, Morphine, and Dilaudid, and there was very minimal change in the pain. Eventually, it was realized Ketamine would be the only possible relief, so finally, some pain management was found. However, now that I had been examined, blood had been taken, images have been captured (ultrasound), results begin to come in...\n\nBefore anything to do with my foot was figured out, the doctors discovered I had Endocarditis of the mitral valve of my heart. Now THAT was unexpected. Then, when more blood test results came back, it was discovered I had not only a severe blood infection, but the cause of my foot woes was a Chronic infection of Osteomyelitis in just about every single bone in my right foot, with the exception of the tarsals and metatarsals. After over a decade of careless IV drug use, carrying a belief that I was just about invincible in a sense, I was slammed back down to reality by a power-slap from life. I was laying in the hospital with not one, but two of the what possible infections and diseases an IV drug user can contract, and neither of which have a necessarily high recovery or survival rate if open-heart surgery and/or amputation are not performed. So now, let's fast-forward...\n\nJanuary 8th, 2025. After seven weeks exactly (49 grueling days) of IV antibiotics, numerous imaging and surgical procedures, the receiving-and-removal of my first ever PICC-line (for those who don't know, a PICC-line is pretty much an IV without the bullshit; catheter is over a foot long, and generally feeds approximately an inch below your heart), a gain of 40 pounds, I was finally discharged with a (relatively) clean bill of health. But, though I gained 40 pounds in that 50 days, in one way, it felt like I had shed a literal ton...\n\nI came out of the hospital sober. Aside from the necessary meds for pain management when absolutely necessary, this had been my longest stretch of sobriety in so long I can't even remember. Hell, in the last four years alone, there hadn't been any single period where I went longer than 24-hours without injecting heroin. But now, even the thought of going back to that life is a living hell I wish to never cross paths with ever again. I feel absolutely zero desire to tangle with that bullshit ever again; it all seems more like a nightmarish dream than a craving that I'll need to avoid like a plague. \n\nThe best way to describe it is, now, when I awake in the morning, I generally feel the same way that I would've normally felt immediately after slamming a shot of dope - I feel normal; I feel well; I feel like everything is okay. And, in the end, that's the whole reason i grew dependant upon dope anyways - because it made me feel normal and made me feel well. But finally, I can't explain how incredibly it feels to know that that is now something I feel every morning, but without having to aimlessly chase after that demonic succubus and give my life to it, both figuratively and literally. \n\nAfter 13 long years spent going further and further down a never ending downward spiral, way past rock bottom, where the only sources of light are the flame with which you cook your shot, and the distant strobing of reds-and-blues which are almost guaranteed to ignite your future, where the only friend to be had are the ones who provide your fix and the ones who don't Rob you when you get right, where the only future I had was allot closer than could be considered comfortable, especially considering it was in the shape of a coffin, afixed with a \"The End\" sign.\n\nAfter 13 long years, I finally saw the light at the end of that dark, depressing tunnel, and when a hand became extended to give me help, I took that hand and finally pulled myself out. Ordinarily, both Endocarditis and Osteomyelitis are seen as very negative things, but I must say, in this one particular case, being diagnosed with these two infections came as a blessing in disguise, because it was exactly the shove I needed to send me in the right direction.",

To be honest the worst part for me is just the mental cravings and boredom at this point, which is like nothing. My girlfriend however started going to a methadone clinic this week. They have her on 50mg, they even upped her to today 60 even though she feels fine on 50. I have my own personal issues with clinics but I do understand why they‚Äôre helpful. I just don‚Äôt want her to get trapped having to go to a clinic every day. At this point they‚Äôre trying to feed her more than she needs, and they do this because they think they know better even though they‚Äôre not real professionals. My question is do you guys think she should keep going and immediately start the tapering process, or should she try to stop now before it builds up in her system and she‚Äôs hooked on that. ",

I tend to attract those types of people, maybe I give off a weak vibe which makes people feel like they can get away with treating me like shit.\n\n I guess a part of my drug usage comes from wanting to feel loved and appreciated but I've genuinely never experienced that feeling even from my own family, I overheard my mother once say \" he was an accident\" which may have caused some of the abuse mostly physical and emotional in early childhood.\n\nI just feel like my whole life is a struggle and feeling inadequate, chasing this feeling of love so hard that I've lost myself in the process.\n\nI genuinely don't know what to do and the oxy has such a grip on my life I hate it, but at the same time it's the only thing that gives me some relief and to be able to get through the day.\n\nAny support/ advice would be greatly appreciated.",

Firstly, I have something called \"Trigeminal Neuralgia\" (a face pain condition nicknamed \"the suicide disease\" and considered the \"worst pain known to mankind\" by the medical community - I am not saying that in a way to belittle anyone else's pain here...just trying to give some context to what I live with) and have been on Morphine 15mg ER (12hr) and Dilaudid 4mg every 8 hours since 2018. I've found I get less pain relief when taking \"as prescribed\" and get less sleep than I do if I save the Dilaudid and 1 of the 2 morphine ER doses for night time (I do usually crush the morphine pill at night).. if I take the Dilaudid 3x a day, I am in more pain by the end of my day and am kept up most of the night, causing me more struggle to get through my daily life. Whereas if I save the Dilaudid and one of the morphine to take all together at night in a lump dose, it will lower my nighttime pain level and allow me to actually fall asleep a couple hours after taking it all. Then when I wake up and start my day, I'll take the other morphine. So I go 24 hours without taking the Dilaudid. I don't run out of either of my meds early, but I do still tend to get a slight euphoric feeling at night an hour or so after taking all of my meds which is nice. I work part time as a substitute teacher and am usually able to push through my daily pain 3-4 times a week enough to work and never take my Dilaudid while I'm at work - I just deal as much as possible. I do still struggle to get through my days..struggle to deal with the depression and thoughts that come with being in such severe daily pain and getting attacks of even more excruciating pain set off by even small triggers like touching my face, wind hitting my face, cold temps, eating, talking, brushing my teeth, and things of that nature. Not sure if I've given y'all have enough information to answer this question, feel free to ask for more if needed to give an opinion on this.

Before I got clean I remember I was very depressed and had no hope in continuing my life. Today is a very different me 21 days and still full of hope and gratitude and happy that I did it. It isn‚Äôt easy I will say but worth it yes. I got the cold or a fever around 18 days clean so coming off a withdrawal then being sick right after with a fever is not too lucky but I count my blessing of still being clean. I had horrendous dreams of me relapsing and being in a dark place once the fever hit, I also had super strong craving while I am sick. Have not and will not give in it wouldn‚Äôt be worth it at all. Not gonna lie did think about taking kratom to sleep better with this fever but I have not taken it and understand the complexity of such a decision so I‚Äôm very careful right now. Haven‚Äôt taken anything my mind is hopeful but physically sick also feel lil bit of rsl with this fever it‚Äôs weird.\n\nSorry to rant just wanted to post a update and say it is very well worth getting clean. I almost took my life a few times when I didn‚Äôt think there was a way out. To those who feel like this I promise you look to me there is a way out. Sure I might not be years clean but I have taken the jump that I didn‚Äôt think was worth it and it turned out def worth it. If anyone has questions feel free to ask I can answer. I am not on MAT or anything I am completely clean. I have been clean before this time feels hopeful. \n\n",

    "selftext": "\nFor the last two years, I‚Äôve been doing 5-15 fentanyl blues a day. It all started with oxy after a gnarly injury four years ago, but, as it always does, that turned into something far worse.\nAbout a week ago, my dealer got these new pills, and they were absolutely awful. I mean so bad they wouldn‚Äôt just fail to stop my withdrawals‚Äîthey actually made them worse. It got to the point where I did 30 of them in one day and still felt horrible. I was experiencing feelings I‚Äôd never had before. I couldn‚Äôt sleep for three days.\nAt some point, I just said, ‚ÄúFuck this, I‚Äôm done.‚Äù I decided to stop taking them altogether. I‚Äôve been wanting to get sober for a while, but I‚Äôve been terrified of the withdrawals. Back when I was only doing three real oxys a day, the withdrawals were hell, so I assumed that this time it would be far worse.\nI had some methadone set aside from my take-homes a few months back when I tried to quit before. Back then, I wasn‚Äôt serious about it and was still using. I remember taking 60mg of methadone during that attempt and feeling moderately okay for most of the day, and I‚Äôd still get home and do one or two. For some delusional reason I‚Äôd always convince myself I could quit on my own and just went back to full on fent smh.\nThis time, I went ahead and took just 2ml of the methadone‚Äîa literal drop (roughly 20mg)‚Äîand ever since I stopped doing the fentanyl blues, I‚Äôve been sticking to that same dose when I wake up. Here‚Äôs the crazy part: it‚Äôs been a week now, and I don‚Äôt even feel like I need to take it anymore when I wake up.\nWhat the actual fuck is happening? How is this even possible? My body went from running on heavy opiates to feeling almost completely fine within the span of a few days. This is literally insane. How?!\nAs good as all of this sounds, my biggest fear is the mental cravings. Like I still want to put stuff in my nose really bad. I think the best move for me is to go back to a clinic and either switch to subs or get on a taper program. It doesn‚Äôt sound like I‚Äôd need more than the 30mg they start you out with, but I‚Äôd rather have some semblance of support and stability. As much as I really hate to admit it, and wish it was just over, even If I really can just stop all together it‚Äôs seems like it‚Äôll be easier for me to relapse. ",

I was going to do this alone, without the help of any supportive meds but last Saturday afternoon I couldnt take it anymore and called 911.\n\nI was so ashamed and worried about the stigma I would face inside the ER, but I was immediately given 16mg of Suboxone which unfortunately put me into precip (it was about 30 hours after last use) after that they admitted me and have been giving me 40mg oxy every 3 hours for the symptoms, Deludid IV as needed, methadone that goes up 20mg a day until I feel comfortable and of course aderax and colonine. I'm still extremely uncomfortable and still feel extremely severe withdrawal, which the oxy and Deludid are not really helping but I'm so so relieved they are trying to keep me comfortable here and being so nice. They have me on 6th floor in a single room with a view of the city. I'll be here until Monday when they are moving me to a inpatient rehab center. \n\nThis is in San Francisco so I'm just glad I can be in a safe place where I can get sober and not use.

    "selftext": "I used to buy a week's worth at a time.  For those on the East Coast, I would grab 7 bricks, each of which had 5 bundles in them.  I was doing 1 brick a day.  Roughly $100 a day.  This was 6-10 years ago.\n\nThere was no better feeling than coming home from a reup knowing I was good for the next 7 days, although it was more like 5 or 6 days because I always messed up and went apeshit at least a couple times during the week and did more than my allocated daily amount.  The comfort of having my drugs and no worries because I made it home safe, didn't get robbed or arrested, and didn't have to go back out there for awhile.\n\nThen around day 4 or 5, the stress and anxiety would start to hit.  All the worrying about where I was getting the money, how much I was spending, all the debt I was in, the places and people I would have to rob next because I NEEDED IT TO SURVIVE.  Hitting up the various plugs, venturing out to P-Town where I had absolutely no business being. I've been shot at, stabbed, done the stabbing, gotten beat up, beat other people up.  Got cheated and hustled and felt truly shocked.  \"How could anyone do this to me\" I always asked myself, obviously forgetting about all the horrible things I would do to secure the drugs. \n\nI justified it all. I wore a suit and tie everyday to work. A mortgage, car loans, bills.  A wife and kids who I had to support. Mouths to feed. \"Normal\" friends. Absolutely no one would look at me and think JUNKIE.  But I was a junkie of the highest degree.  The biggest scumbag.  A wolf in sheep's clothing. I hid it so well.  Never got caught, never OD'd, my wife and family didn't suspect a thing. I was living a lie, but which life was the lie and which was real? I didn't even know anymore.  Survival mode for years. Locked in and focused on making money, legally and illegally, so I could support the use. \n\nTrying over and over and over to get clean without admitting to anyone how badly I fucked up.  How could I ever admit something like that? Someone like me being a heroin addict? No fucking way.  I could never take the embarrassment and shame of it all.  What would my wife think? What would my family and friends think of me. They would see the absolute loser I really was and I was never going to let that happen.  Not while I was living anyway.  \n\nI would build up the courage to quit. Brace for the shock of cold turkey withdrawal. Still had to wake up with the kids and get them ready for school.  Still had to go to work.  Still had to coach, go on camping outings and be the perfect husband and father I so foolishly duped myself into believing I was. Throwing up constantly, shitting my ass out, sweating, the body aches and pains, the feeling of NEVER GETTING COMFORTABLE.  The sleepless nights laying next to my wife in bed while she was sleeping. Through sheer white knuckle willpower I tried not to toss and turn... waiting for her to finally go to sleep so I could retreat downstairs and suffer through the night alone. Every night feeling like hours. The dread of dawn coming when the kids would wake up and I would have to face life without drugs.  \n\nThis wasn't sustainable.  I would make it 3 or 4 days.. a week tops. I couldn't take more than that.  Behind on work, wife getting concerned that I wasn't getting better from my \"stomach flu\", I had to pick up.  I promised myself a taper, use benzos, use cocaine to come off Heroin.  I tried everything.  Being sober never could actually stick.  How could it?  I was living in my own personal hell.  No one to talk to about it.  Alone in the pit of despair that was my conscious. I cannot describe how it felt. Thoughts of ending myself came often. I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy. \n\nWhat a fuckin joke it all was. All for what?  So I could be numb for a few fleeting moments.  It didn't even feel good anymore.\n\nThis is already longer than it should be so I'll fast forward. After a couple years of the above cycle, I finally got arrested.  I ran out to get pizza for the family and didn't come back.  After hours and hours and hours the police finally let me make a phone call.  I called my wife to come bail be out of jail.  She was worried sick about me.  She thought I died.  I wasn't picking up my phone obviously, the police had it. Like the perfect wife she is, she didn't ask questions. She came straight to the jail and bailed me out.  \n\nThe jig was up. I broke down and told her everything. I'll spare you the details but to say she was pissed would be putting it mildly. Rightfully so. \n\nI was on the brink of losing my wife and kids.  I now had felony charges.  I was facing losing my professional license and my career of 18 years. My employer fired me.  Even with all this, I felt better than I did in years.  I finally could talk to someone about my addiction. The secrets were over! Something I never though was possible.  After opening up to my wife, I told my siblings, my parents, my in laws.  Everyone who was close to me.  And god damn I was never called a loser junkie.  All the fear I had was bullshit.\n\nFinally, after being open and honest and with the support of my friends and family, I got clean.  It still wasn't easy, but holy shit was it easier than keeping all those secrets.  I could actually open up and talk about all these feelings that were creeping back.  I joined one of the fellowships. Holy shit there are other people out there who are just like me?  And they made it out the other side?  I couldn't believe it. I wasn't unique and I wasn't alone.  \n\n6 years later and my life is back. My wife and I made it out the other side, we have a better relationship now then we ever had.  My kids are growing up, almost done with High School.  I can be there for them. Really be there without the fog and distraction of an opiate addiction.  My finances are back on track. I started over. I got a second chance.  I was able to hold my professional license and career because I was honest with the regulators about my addiction, it is a disease after all and I was getting treatment. I have a new better job now. \n\nThat's pretty much my story.  If you made it this far your a champ.  I know I'm not some eloquent writer. I just want to say if you're out there struggling like I was then TELL ON YOURSELF.  There are people out there who who will love and support you.  Society loves a comeback story and is very forgiving for the addict who is trying their hardest to come back. \n\nDO NOT DO THIS ALONE. Find support, talk to people, be open and honest about your feelings. If you want it then fucking get it.  Do it like your life depends on it, because it does. You are worth it. Legends are born in the valley of struggle. Become a legend. \n\n",

    "selftext": "As a recovering addict of oxycodone, I have come to the realization that it is not solely the euphoria of opiates to which we are addicted. I would argue that the process itself‚Äîthe act of contacting a dealer, meeting them at a designated location, acquiring the drugs, and returning home‚Äîcan be just as addictive. There is something inherently thrilling to the human brain in engaging in activities we know are illegal, yet manage to execute without detection, evading the government‚Äôs reach. This illicitness creates a sense of euphoria in itself.\n\nI have heard of countries such as Portugal and cities like Amsterdam, where drug use has been decriminalized, and interestingly, abuse rates are lower compared to when substances were criminalized. The thrill that comes with the illegality of the act seems to be a significant factor in the addiction; when drugs are legalized, that thrill diminishes, making the substance itself less enticing. Additionally, there is a certain euphoria associated with the ability to acquire what one desires when so many are disconnected from access, unable to obtain what they need when they need it.",

    "selftext": "I am finally free from heroin after a 5 year relapse. I was thrown into recovery this time when my fiance of 7 years stole and crashed my car in a Xanax blackout on August 26th. On August 27th (my clean date) I was admitted to the hospital for inpatient detox and arrived at an all women's recovery center on September 3rd. I just got home from treatment today and was reunited with my phone. Returning to the apartment I used in for 3 years was a shock.... After I left for treatment my fiance went off the rails completely. He'll be home from his men's program in a week and I already have a boundary with him- if he relapses, the relationship is over. I'll leave him and do whatever it takes to protect my sobriety this time. \n\nI'm in the market for another car so I'm working on cleaning my apartment and getting setup with outpatient. I chose to stay inpatient for 4 1/2 months to do something differently this time. Up until October 2019 I was an alcoholic/cocaine addict. Once I was introduced to heroin I believed I'd die an addict. Waking up and not having to get well is absolutely beautiful. I just received my fourth sublocade shot and have adjusted to it very well. I just wanted to hop on here to connect with some other recovering opiate addicts! I'll either walk to meetings or participate on zoom until I have transportation. I am beyond happy to be free from the all-consuming bondage of opiate addiction. My life is already full of change/positivity/hope, even though I have nothing but a roof over my head. It was all worth it and I thank the heavens I'm alive and going to bed clean again tonight. ",

    "selftext": "For the first time in three years of taking opiates daily, I‚Äôve made it through an entire week sober. It‚Äôs a milestone I never thought I‚Äôd hit, and I‚Äôve been reading so many stories on this sub, both inspiring and heartbreaking but that has been a huge source of motivation for me.\n\nI know my story isn‚Äôt unique. I‚Äôm in the same position as millions of others, I have a good life. No one knows about my addiction, but it‚Äôs been quietly tearing my life apart. Over the years, I‚Äôve withdrawn from friends and family, stopped going out, and became a shell of myself. The changes were gradual, so subtle that people around me didn‚Äôt notice.\n\nLast year was the worst for me. I isolated myself almost completely. Even when I did see people, I couldn‚Äôt wait to get back home. My entire life revolved around finding, stocking, and planning for these pills. I didn‚Äôt see myself as an addict but just as someone who needed them, like anti depressants. I didn‚Äôt want to post here until I had something to show for it or until I could say I‚Äôd made real progress.\n\nNow, after just one week sober, I‚Äôm starting to feel like myself again. I know it‚Äôs still very early, but I‚Äôm feeling back to myself. \n\nI know this isn‚Äôt the kind of post that‚Äôs interesting‚Äîno robberies, no dramatic rock bottom. But I think that‚Äôs the point. Most addicts aren‚Äôt the stereotype we think of. Many of us live in nice homes, hold good jobs, and keep up appearances. We don‚Äôt talk about it because of the embarrassment,  (that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here and not telling my family) and because we don‚Äôt see ourselves in the public perception of what ‚Äúan addict‚Äù looks like. \n\nRight now my life is saveable but if I lost my job and family, there‚Äôll be no reason for me to get sober. So I hope someone who‚Äôs going down a same path makes the decision now before it gets worse. \n",

    "selftext": "I am a longtime lurker, first time poster.\n\nI have a long history of addiction. My drug of choice has always been of the opioid variety. My use was mostly manageable up until I made the conscious, intelligent decision to try heroin, after which I spent about 2 years as a full time junkie. I then got clean and really put my life together. I became highly successful in my career, got married to the most loving, supportive wife a guy could ever hope for, and generally crushed it.\n\nI relapsed using Kratom not long after Covid hit and have only managed to string together bits and pieces of sobriety since then. My life has not completely fallen apart like it did from junk, but the cost has been high nonetheless. Aside from the monetary demands such an addiction requires, I have totally isolated from my wife and all my friends and I have lost my sense of self. Where there used to be an intelligent, driven, physically and mentally fit man there now exists an empty, anxious, sedentary shell of what I once was.\n\nBy some miracle I've finally begun to pick myself back up over the last couple weeks. I've been working out every day, journaling, going on walks outside, and spending quality time with my wife. This may not seem like much, but it's far more than I've done at any other time over the past couple years.\n\nOver the last few months I have been using 7-hydroxymitragynine at doses that are quite high (several hundred milligrams per dose). A couple weeks ago I managed to string together 4 days clean, followed by 5 days of Suboxone at 8mg, followed by this current binge I have been on for about 9 days. I am consuming about 300mg per dose, which I take 3 times per day.\n\nIt's time for this shit to end. I can't do it anymore and I'm so, so tired of the whole thing. I'm ripping the band aid off (again) tomorrow. I know from personal experience that the physical withdrawal will not be horrible in comparison to other substances, but all withdrawal sucks pretty hard. Teary eyes, runny nose, mild sweating and chills, agitation and anxiety. It's not the physical stuff that gets me, it's the mental. I tend to just lay around and wallow in it, so I end up just focusing on how much it sucks, which sets me up for failure. This time I intend to be as active as possible, going on walks, lightly exercising, writing in my journal, and doing whatever I can to stay busy. I have the option to get on suboxone but I REALLY want to avoid that if possible, as I know how awful it can be to come off of. 7 hydroxy withdrawals are a walk in the park in comparison. Additionally, I don't feel totally like myself on subs, if that makes sense. They dull my senses.\n\nThis HAS to be it. I am in a situation career-wise which requires me to be at 100%, which I can only do if I'm totally clean. Beyond that, I'm simply fucking sick of it all. I miss being myself and I miss having a life.\n\nI could use any support I can get, so I'm posting this here. If you got through all this word vomit, thank you for reading.\n\nTL;DR\nTomorrow is day one of quitting a large 7 hydroxymitragynine habit. Just asking for support.",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone, my boyfriend has been abusing opiates for a year and it started with chronic back pain due to work. His drug of choice was always oxys but once they stopped working he ended up trying fentanyl in early Dec. he was clean for all of Dec as we are now with a methadone clinic and his daily dose helps immensely with withdrawal but does little for his back pain. His birthday was on Friday and we jointly made the decision for him to use a few oxys to get through the day pain-wise (I agree this was a terrible decision also on my part and I likely enabled his relapse) he instead grabbed fentanyl and ended up being very fucked up for four days which was horrible to witness for me and he was very apologetic but stated that oxy doesn‚Äôt touch his back pain at all. Today he is clean again and refocusing on his methadone program and recommitting to getting off all other opiates. I have never used any drugs and don‚Äôt struggle with any addiction so I know I can‚Äôt possibly understand the situation but I can‚Äôt help but feel very hurt that he lied and chose to use fentanyl behind my back when we agreed just oxys. His family is non existent and I‚Äôm the only person in his life that knows everything other than his medical team. My question is the support people in your life who have been affected by your use, did you feel they helped more by being strict and more tough love or more understanding and supportive? I guess I want to know how to support a recovering addict best with something I can‚Äôt truly understand. We are also doing every other alternative therapy to treat his chronic back pain. ",

    "selftext": "\nHi, everyone.\n\nI‚Äôve shared parts of my story here before, so I‚Äôll try to keep this brief, but I‚Äôm feeling really stuck and could use some advice.\n\nTo recap: I‚Äôve had some brief experiences with opioid use that led to withdrawal and a couple of overdoses. Because of that, I was put on Sublocade at the highest dose (300 mg). I didn‚Äôt feel normal sick; instead, I felt drunk, foggy, and awful, but the doctors thought I was still in withdrawal and gave me another 300 mg dose two weeks later. It made me incredibly sick‚Äîmy kidneys started failing because I couldn‚Äôt keep anything down, and I was bedridden for weeks. On top of that, I had untreated pneumonia from my first overdose, which only made things worse.\n\nEventually, I got off Sublocade, which was a relief, but I‚Äôve still been struggling with anxiety, insomnia, and chronic pain from bulging discs. A few weeks ago, I went to the hospital looking for help with these issues. The doctor was adamant that I needed 32 mg/day of Suboxone. I told her that felt way too high for me, so she prescribed me 16 mg/day (8 mg twice a day) instead. Even then, I‚Äôve only been taking 8 mg/day because 32 mg seemed so extreme, and I thought 8 mg was a small dose.\n\nNow I‚Äôve been taking 8 mg/day for a couple of weeks, and I want to stop, but I feel stuck. Suboxone tastes awful, I struggle to take it, and it doesn‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs helping with my pain, anxiety, or sleep. I never had what I‚Äôd consider a severe, long-lived addiction‚ÄîI know any addiction is bad, but mine was short-lived, and now I feel like I‚Äôm trapped on this medication that I don‚Äôt even want to take.\n\nI‚Äôve also been wondering if I should switch back to Sublocade (Subliquid) as a way to stop Suboxone, but I‚Äôm terrified of getting sick again like I did last time. At least with Suboxone, I feel like I have some control because I can stop taking it. With an injection, I‚Äôd be stuck if something went wrong.\n\nOn top of everything, I‚Äôm about to go into a custody situation, and I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll be drug tested. I know Suboxone will show up, and I don‚Äôt want opioids in my system. I‚Äôm so fed up, but I don‚Äôt know the best way forward.\n\nWill I go into withdrawal if I stop cold turkey after a couple of weeks on Suboxone? Should I try to taper off instead? Or should I try Sublocade again, even though I‚Äôm terrified of feeling sick like last time? I know I can‚Äôt ask for specific medical advice but I‚Äôm hoping perhaps some of you might have had some experience that may help guide my decision making. \n\nAny advice or insight would mean so much. Thank you. ",

Then ofcourse the supply drastically changed in the US and it became all fent with tranq in it. I tried methadone went upto 100 mgs but I was processing the medication so fast I would literally take my dose at 9am and be feeling shitty by 6pm. And it wasn't mental it was both. I tried spilt dosing but that was a huge hurdle and they didn't wanna give me it with me smoking weed even tho it was legal through my medical card and they had no issue with it before. \n\nMy best times at sobriety have been when I have just bit the bullet and went cold turkey no fent for 3 days and took teeeeeny tiny amounts of subs  after and prayed there weren't PWD. When that would work I'd stabilize on a dose of 8mg tops usually and I'd make my Dr appt for the sublocade shot. I wouldn't feel perfect even on the shot the first month but everything becomes bearable. By the second shot I'd feel pretty stabilized. \n\nI just recently even went to a detox and it was a 5 day taper with methadone. I came out felt pretty shitty from the quick taper and tried my best to wait another day or 2 and take subs. Didn't work went into pwd I was shocked.

I would be so anxious/agitated that I couldn‚Äôt even sit down, I‚Äôd just walk in laps around the house. I‚Äôd be pouring sweat even with the aircon blaring at 20¬∞C (68¬∞F).\n\nI tried taking 40mg of propranolol one day when having severe WD‚Äôs and within an hour they all but disappeared. It got rid of at least 90% of my WD symptoms. I could sit still and watch TV and my anxiety was greatly reduced. I wasn‚Äôt bucketing sweat and I felt almost human. If 40mg doesn‚Äôt work you can bump it up to 80mg.\n\nIf you combine this with Imodium (loperamide) for the diarrhoea and Buscopan (hyoscine butylbromide) for the stomach pains then you can ride out your WD‚Äôs with minimal discomfort. I came off 300mg of pharma oxy a day and with this combo my WD‚Äôs were reduced by at least 80-90%.\n\nYou‚Äôll need a prescription for propranolol in most places but just find an online/phone doctor and tell them your usual doctor gives it to you for high blood pressure (make sure you‚Äôre honest with them about any medications you‚Äôre taking and your medical history to ensure it‚Äôs safe for you to take). Most doctors will give it to you without hesitation as it‚Äôs not a controlled medication and it‚Äôs relatively safe to take.\n\nGood luck with your opiate journey guys",

So I know to most people this sounds stupid and lots have it worse than me but I'm at a lost.\n\nFor the last 15ish years I've been addicted to something.  1st were roxys then methadone then norco then suboxone and now back to hydrocodone.\nI take what I guess is a rather small dose around 3 10mg a day some days only 2 but no matter how hard I try to quit I can't get pass day 1 or 2 without breaking\n\nImo the withdrawal pretty much feels the same no matter the substance.\n\nI don't really know what I'm asking or a point to my post other than I want to be done so bad but I'm so scared. The RLs and anxiety is what gets me. I feel like I'm happy and sociable when I take them.  I only have 1 person that I know to get them from and that I trust but that's an hour away and it disgust me every morning that I make that drive to go re-up. I hate this about me. Why can't I just give it up.  I think I can do this I just won't message that person anymore but that's when I have something in my system. The 1st day I'm without I automatically freak out and I think I'm basically making myself feel wd even when I'm not even there yet but the fear gets to me. \n\nI've tried gabapentin and for some odd reason I swear it makes my rls worse and makes me move and think so slow! Kratom seems to work some during that day but I know that can be it's own problem. I'm learning nothing can really take it away.\n\nIn my head I know what I NEED to do but I just can't do it for some reason. Sorry so long and all over the place. I guess I need some encouragement! Will I eventually get over feeling so anxious and just feeling so weird without it? I just want to wake up go to work and do what i got to do without constantly stressing about getting something to start my day. Thanks for those that took the time to read this",

    "selftext": "I do not see anything on this, so I thought I would ask. Backstory for me is I have been on Suboxone for at least 10 years (lost count now). 4 mg, four times daily (16 mg daily) for about 9 years and that went great. Then about a year ago suddenly one day, I started getting a bad case of the jitters and extreme nervousness running through my body with every dose that I took. It all started in one day and never stopped. I couldn't figure it out. Finally after feeling like garbage every day for several months, I decided to begin to lower my dosage a little at a time, and sure enough, each time I dropped, I would feel a little less jitters. I am now down to less than .5 mg daily and that worked for a while but now my jitters are now returning. I am 64 years old and had planned to remain on Suboxone for the rest of my life because I have always had a drug and alcohol addiction since I was a teenager, and Suboxone stops my cravings for both. I don't want to go back to those days. My question is does anyone else experience this, the \"jitters\", not so much anxiety, just nervousness while on the medication. Like I mentioned earlier, I never had an issue with this for the first 9 years.",

    "selftext": "Hi all just coming to do an update after my last post. I‚Äôm on day 13 off Suboxone and just over 4 months off of a 5 year Oxy then Dilaudid habit. \n\nMuch better today. Rls thankfully only lasted about 4 nights for me. I believe it was nights 7-11. Still have back pain and some mild leg pains. Main symptoms right now are brain fog, fatigue, sweating and gross armpits. I literally use baby wipes then deodorant all day and they still smell and feel sticky. Gross.\n\nI‚Äôve definitely been emotional but some in a good way. It‚Äôs like I feel like an era is over and I‚Äôve grown out of that era. Also, dealing with some resentment and guilt from me to my husband and my husband to me. If you read my last post I mentioned that I lied about my addiction from everyone until I told my husband in September. What I didn‚Äôt mention is that I had never tried opiates besides in a hospital setting after my 2 c-sections until my husband introduced them to me. He always said we can never do these for more than 2 days in a row and only every couple/few months. Well he could do that, I eventually got hooked. I did blow up on him and blame him for a moment there but it‚Äôs not his fault.\n\nNow my husband to me. Instead of worrying about things you would think a spouse would worry about with their spouse in addiction, he seems to be fixated on these types of questions and accusations. ‚ÄúWho were you buying them from‚Äù ‚ÄúWas it a man‚Äù ‚ÄúDid he look at you, try to touch you or offer you anything for something‚Äù He‚Äôs always been a bit protective and a jealous type but I just didn‚Äôt expect this. I get that I lied to him but I‚Äôve never lied to him about anything else and have been 100% loyal to him over the past 10 years that we have been together. \n\nPlus I was a career women until 2020 when Covid hit (also when my addiction to a hold). Schools, daycares, any indoor activities for kids closed and my life changed drastically to now being a stay at home, homeschooling mom. Anyways, he knows I/we have money (I‚Äôm grateful for that part) and I never needed to do anything ‚Äúextra‚Äù to buy pills. Especially once I found out that I like Dilaudid better and could get them for very cheap. I live in BC üá®üá¶ where we have the safe supply program. \n\nIt‚Äôs a bit of an emotional roller coaster but it‚Äôs all worth it. One thing that kind of surprised me is that, all of the times that I withdrawal‚Äôd off pills, the cravings for pills/subs were very very intense. The withdrawal off subs has been long and tough but I haven‚Äôt had cravings for anything except to feel like a normal human again. \n\nJust sharing as we all come from different walks of life, different circumstances, cultures, countries and everything else yet we are all so alike with our struggles, understanding and empathy with addiction.

I have been using oxy for around 4 years. I couldn‚Äôt function anymore, i would constantly miss work. I would isolate myself. The oxys were making me feel ill.

    "selftext": "Back in 2020, I went to rehab after a year long OC80 habit. At the end I ate three to four of those blue fuckers a day, it was terrible. I did the whole nine yards: got clean, moved cities, went to university, got a prestigious internship and finished my bachelors thesis with highest grades. All great, everybody so proud, but all along I was feeling like shit. I was young when I went to rehab, and I was in such a rush to get out in the world and prove everybody wrong that I didn't gave two fucks about what caused my addictive behaviour.\n\nSome months back, in June, I started taking benzodiazepines, I guess it was for anxiety symptoms. i never did it to get high, only in normal doses per se. Don't think I've ever taken over 40mg diazepam over 24 hrs. I made a deal with myself: hand in your bachelor thesis in December, then seek help. And that's what I did. I'm in the midst of a taper with my local addiction center, and on that front it's great something is being done. They might even offer me some therapy.\n\nA few weeks back, although, life took unexpected turns. I was crushed, emotionally and financially. I bought an OC80, did 40mg, saved 40mg for the day after and nodded the fuck out for two days. The warm blanket felt exactly the way I remembered it. I know why I did it, but I regret it just as much as taking that first benzo back in June.\n\nIt was in the mid of December, today is January 8th, and I just did it for I think the tenth time or something like that. The 20mg don't get me nodding anymore, 40mg barely does. I can go two to three days, sensing no withdrawals, but then I do them again. As mentioned, this has been going on for some weeks.\n\nI went to this sub for so much advice, support and comfort back in 2020 and 2021 when I was in active addiction and in my recovery phase. Now I'm on the steps of a nasty oxy habit again. Apparently, I can't get into my head what it is I'm doing. I did around 50mg tonight, and I plan of doing the rest. It will be the last pill, but I said that the last time and the last time again.\n\nThis may sound so fucking dumb, but please, someone, remind me why we don't do this shit. Remind me why this is the direct pathway to misery. Remind that I'm better than this. Remind me there's still a turning point without going through the whole nine yards again. I'm not sure I can do that.\n\n",

It‚Äôs funny, while opiates and weed are totally different (I have a medical card), the mindset is similar. On both drugs I thought I could never be sober, I would be awkward or people wouldn‚Äôt like me, I wouldn‚Äôt be able to survive really without them‚Ä¶but less than 2 weeks after stopping both; I realized the exact opposite is true. I find myself more present than ever, I feel less awkward in social situations, I‚Äôm saving even more money; and I‚Äôve been progressing in EMDR therapy like crazy since stopping weed.\n\nI was using weed to help stop my horrible nightmare/night terrors. While it was a good crutch, I got to a point in therapy where I felt stuck basically. I stopped smoking (only because I was trying to get a new job) and found myself making leaps and bounds in therapy I never thought possible. My therapist noticed almost immediately too! Even though I only stopped smoking for the job, I‚Äôve decided to not start back up again! While therapy is still incredibly hard and I have a long way to go, I have made it SO far and I can‚Äôt wait to look back in another 500 days and see the results!\n\nThis year, my goal is to find an in person meeting that I can be apart of. I have been completely shocked to find how much solidarity and being around likeminded people helps me. I‚Äôve always been someone who‚Äôs never really wanted to go, but lately I feel the need for support and want to capitalize on those feelings.\n\nI hope anyone still in the throws of addiction that sees this, knows it‚Äôs really possible to get out, you just have to be ready! There are so many resources out there, and I‚Äôm always here and happy to help any/everyone I can. I thought I was alone, I could never be helped, and I was better off dead; but I was so wrong. \n\nAnd to my friends that are in recovery, keep fighting the good fight!

We‚Äôve stopped taking naps so that we are tired enough by the end of the night to sleep throughout the entirety of it. Take showers to avoid RLS.

We were so miserable being stuck in our heads about what went wrong, seeing everyone live life. We need to do that instead of being upset that we don‚Äôt. The money used for drugs could be used to go to the movies, out to eat, skating, bowling, anything! But we spent it all on drugs and would be so sad and angry that we didn‚Äôt have money to do what other ppl our age are doing (23). No more, no more woe is me.

But no other comfort meds like Benzos, low potency opiates or Pregablin because of the risk of abuse/addiction. \n\n**Current Situation**  \n- Relapsed twice over the holidays (briefly, 1 day each). No physical withdrawals post-relapse, but struggling with PAWS symptoms, especially:  \n  - Low energy/motivation affecting work.  \n  - Premature ejaculation impacting intimacy.  \n\nl\n**Questions for the Community**  \n\n1. **Medication Options**  \n   - Has anyone discussed PAWS with an NHS doctor and received non-opiate treatments?  \n   - Considering SSRIs for:  \n     - Managing premature ejaculation.  \n     - Boosting energy/motivation to develop healthy routines (exercise, sleep, diet).  \n\n2. **Psychedelics for PAWS**  - Alternative to speaking with doctor \n   - Past use of psychedelics (LSD, DMT, microdosed mushrooms) provided significant motivation/mental clarity.  \n   - Anyone with experience using psychedelics to address PAWS symptoms?  \n\n**Summary**  \nLooking for guidance on NHS treatments (excluding methadone/Subutex. I appreciate many report these help and I could be persuaded but I would prefer to avoid opiates entirely, ideally. But I am open minded enough to hear peoples experiences) and insights on using psychedelics for PAWS recovery.  \n\n",

My partner says it's extremely triggering to see me like that, but I can't help it. I just have to explain that I'm not high it's just a reaction to my medication. I was just wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience with Brixadi or any other of the monthly bupe injections, I know there's at least one or 2 more brands... I asked my provider if I can get a lower dosage and they keep saying \"let's talk about it next month\" and here I am again barely able to stay awake after going this morning. Thanks, and stay strong y'all. Life is so much better without that shit.",

no ur having ur very first migraine,get used to it,she gave me two co codamols 32/500mg and the pain eventually faded , but it also stopped me thinking and feeling ,i had recently had my whole world torn apart by my father and didnt understand depression, and thats where it started,\n\nat 18 i met the father of my kids and was duly knocked up within days,and i was overjoyed coz that baby meant id soon be in my own place and without going into details,there was a stepfather ,and this baby meant escaping that ,and thats all i will explain abt that,that first pregnancy i stopped using ,and went full metal hippy,i gave my brother my eminem cds as i didnt want my unborn baby affected by angry music ,i was gonna have a natural pain relief free birth (that got shit canned the first time i had a contraction) so in 2002 my first child was born and within months me and her had moved into our own place and shrtly after her father joined us and i had a perfect little home for my perfect little family but little chinks started appearing ,thoughts.like \"ive escaped but now ur not there to stop him doing it to (younger sis) now that i wasnt there to protect her ,and thats where my painkiller use started to escalate coz my mind was starting to tear itself apart and painkillers stopped thst so i could function. \n\nthe first time i realised id beome addicted was 2days after getting a Second positive pregnacy test in 2004 ,i knew i was overdoing it but the second i saw the 2lines i threw out all my painkillers,2 days later i started crampimg and spotting and i was smart enough to realise that id gone from 48  painkillers a day to nothing and my body was going nuts,and i was terrified ,i was scared if told a doctor socisl services wud be informed and be cutting the cord the day he was born and taking him away , so i took 6 tablets a day all through rhe pregnanxy thinking such a small ammont wud not affect the baby in late 2004 my son was born an addict and i knew the reason he screamed constantly in his first few weeks was down to me  and i hated myself.\n\ncut to july 2012 , my mam had just found out what her ex husbad had done to me through my childhood,i didnt no it as i left hers but that would be the day i started on a d ownward spiral that wud see me lose everything and everyone in less than a year..\nafter i left my mams house,i went home to sleep off my night shift,a few hours later i was gently woken by my now ex husband,i knew that being nicely and gently woken up that something bad had happened ,it did ,my mother had a heart attack,she survived thankfully but in my head ,i caused that, i couldnt deal with knowing i'd nearly killed her and i popped painkillers like the were tictacs,for nearly a year,until the day my doctor bluntly told m if i carried on i wouldnt last 12 months and i realised that i didnt want to die , and i had to get clean it was now or never.\n\nnow this wasnt my first attempt to get clean, far from it id tried self tapering,tapering with help,subutex detoxes and fallen back fairly quickly so i decided there was only one way that this was going to stand a chance of succeeding, i had to go cold turkey and suffer through every withdrawal symptom without any medication to lessen them,and yeah it was the worst mix of symptoms,if i put them all on here i'd probably terrify someone from starting their own journey,so i wont.\n\nif you've read this far and think that this is surely where it all gets better... no , the marriage that i got clean to save ,fell apart in under a month of being clean,it turns out without the painkillers keeping me zombied ,me and my husband did not like each other at all, i walked out with the clothes on my back and nothing else,my mother decided to punish me for that by cutting me off from my kids and i ended up sleeping rough or on the occasional friend's sofa for nearly a year until i got myself a flat,having to start from scratch with no family to help me at the age of 31 was hard ,i realised how easy id had it before , but im grateful for that experience because it made me grow up and become self reliant.made me a better person.\n\nslowly i built bridges with my family ,and in 2017 after a fire forced me to move back to the village i grew up in,i bumped into my former boss and friend,and we fell in love and have been together ever since.\n\nif you had asked me back in 2013 if id stick a bet on me being clean for 12 years ,i'd never have taken that bet,but here i am now a few months off that milestone, so if your at the beginning of your journey to get clean , dont give up, it took me a dozen failed attempts before i got there,it may take a while but life on the other side is worth it.\n\nfinally im going to post 2 photos in the comments one from 2013 during my withdrawal period.\n\nthe second is from 2 years ago",

But even if you accept that premise - the only \"off ramp\" they seem to offer is easy access to Naltrexone for overdoses!

However, I told the woman at the desk the truth, that I was truly afraid if I didn't start that morning I might never walk back into the building. That beautiful angel of a woman pulled some strings and made sure I got admitted into their methadone progam that same day. First two days were the toughest so far. I was more uncomfortable than I maybe had anticipated to be honest, but I just kept reminding myself how much more uncomfortable I'd be if I was raw dogging it and I got through it. A huge help for each day has been my prior post and all of the wonderful advice and love each of you sent my way. No shit, I've come back to that post and reread every single one of these amazing comments every fucking day since I started.  Some days even two or three times.

    "selftext": "I‚Äôve been sober 5 months now and I feel like nothing has changed. I feel the same, live the same monotonous life that I realized very quickly only worked for me while using and feel like I can‚Äôt get out. I have no friends and therapy and the occasional meeting is not enough, but I feel like I‚Äôm incapable of reaching out and putting in the effort to find community and connect with others. I‚Äôve realized I‚Äôm mentally ill and it isn‚Äôt going away with being sober, I‚Äôve tried so many medications that often make it worse and have been on various meds and in therapy since 15. I feel like there isn‚Äôt hope for a better life and I‚Äôm so tempted to give up and start using again just so it can be easier to get through the days. I‚Äôve lost everything I cared about and so many opportunities to drug use and despite being only 23 I can‚Äôt convince myself that it isn‚Äôt over for me already, it feels like it has always been like this and always will. My issues started long before substance use but I haven‚Äôt had more than a few days sober (until now) since 16. I don‚Äôt know how to live and no one is going to hold my hand through the process of learning how to be a person. I don‚Äôt have any motivation because I feel like it‚Äôs a losing battle and I‚Äôll never get out of this hole I‚Äôve dug myself. I have ptsd and it‚Äôs extremely hard to connect to other people and be vulnerable enough to make new connections and trust that it will be ok, so I find myself completely alone all the time as the rest of the world gets further and further away, and my world gets so small again. I felt like this often while using and was convinced it‚Äôd be better when I got sober but it isn‚Äôt. The small amount of progress I finally made that convinced me to get sober cuz I finally had hope for the future is completely gone. I keep finding myself thinking maybe it‚Äôll be better on my next try, as if I‚Äôve already given up and know I‚Äôll be using again soon. I don‚Äôt know how other people function and move forward. I can‚Äôt stop thinking about everything that‚Äôs ever happened in my life and I live completely in the past agonizing about everything, I have nothing going on in my life and nothing to bring me out of my head and I‚Äôm too cowardly to move forward and find good things for myself and do anything I know would help. I finally got a sponsor last month and have stopped texting and calling, every time I reach out I end up not responding for weeks again, I don‚Äôt speak to anyone at work, I feel like a ghost. The only thing that keeps me going is the thought of leaving here forever and just forcing myself to live, I finally got my drivers license, renewed my passport, drafted my two weeks notice- but the end doesn‚Äôt feel any closer, I don‚Äôt feel any better, it still feels so out of reach. I don‚Äôt have confidence I‚Äôll actually do it. In my head I think there‚Äôs two options, move in to sober living in another state, find a better therapist, new job, maybe iop- or drive for a while, get out, and come back and start using again until I have hope I can make it and do better. I think so much about using and the comfort of giving up and resigning myself to waiting and ignoring again. If I don‚Äôt try, I won‚Äôt fail, I won‚Äôt ever have to realize it really won‚Äôt get better. I‚Äôm so tired of waiting for something that may never come and trying for something I might never get and feeling like I‚Äôm failing cuz I‚Äôm not ever doing enough. Even in iop, going to meetings regularly, everything I was supposed to do I felt so trapped and hopeless. I just want to know there‚Äôs some end in sight, some light at the end of the tunnel and this all might be worth it. That I can actually turn things around and have the strength to do it for myself and it won‚Äôt be forever that I feel like this. Sorry for how long and depressing this is I just want to know that someone has felt this way and made it out",

Between looking like my mom and not doing what he couldn‚Äôt it made our relationship tense. I believe his only way to show me love was to give me drugs, pretty much just buy my love. He lost everything and drugs were all he had. Despite all of that I still miss him and love him, but I think his death was a good thing for me. \n\nIt made me more mentally resilient and I don‚Äôt have to worry about him flexing opiates in front of me. Yes he would literally do that as if it were candy. He was my main connection and all my secondary connections are also dead besides an outliner that‚Äôs in prison. Idk I just feel like I couldn‚Äôt do this if he were still around. Even when I went no contact a few years before he died I still had that dark thought in the back of my head. It‚Äôs weird, his death is a weight on my heart but a weight lifted off my shoulders.\n\n(He was speed balling and his heart gave out)",

    "selftext": "\nSo im around day 30 now (i know some people say stop counting days but I still am, not sure why maybe I should indeed stop) but anyways as title suggests II had that mini lapse of 2-3 days of using $40 worth total of powder (had 1-2 days of feeling shitty and one night of very little sleep but that‚Äôs it then felt normal again but yea sure obviously I regret the lapse) - I did indeed go to Thailand with my family (‚Ä¶if anyone remembers my post debating it from a couple of weeks ago) since I was physically okay overall (the lapse was triggered by my idiot brain telling me just get some for the 27+ hours journey flight‚Ä¶.right right, that famous ‚Äújust one more time‚Äù, ‚Äúit def makes sense for xyz reason‚Äù, ‚ÄúI deserve it, I‚Äôve been so good clean‚Äù, ‚Äúlast hoorah, one time won‚Äôt hurt‚Äù, famous words most of have probably aid to ourselves in early recovery)  anyways so since physically I was well enough I decided to go with them for a couple of weeks, by the date of the trip it was just mental agony, but I assumed it would be better for me to be around family and around people than on my own‚Ä¶(I don‚Äôt trust myself for a second right now).\n\nAnyways everything is gorgeous here - my family is financially well off enough, and we are going everywhere to all the cool resorts and attractions and tourist traps and shit and it‚Äôs driving me mad that I can‚Äôt get excited for mostly none of it. Like right now I‚Äôm by the 5 star resort pool with mango shake (my favorite fruit) and a cappuccino and have my prescription vyvanse (which I do not abuse nor have issues with and can easily forget to take or skip on purpose) and I‚Äôm about to go to the beach to do jet ski for an hour and I feel barely anything. I know I would have been so excited once upon a time. But now everything is just barely ok. It‚Äôs obviously still better than being home alone in cold USA right now but the fact I can‚Äôt even enjoy the best of the best life has to offer and how blessed I am makes me feel so ashamed and guilty and scared and yea. Mostly shame. I know how fortunate I actually am. And I am trying so hard to get any feelings back and it‚Äôs not working and all I feel is the sadness and pain of not being able to enjoy anything which I guess is a feeling too. Sadness. I am stopping every five minutes to be grateful, to feel and be in the moment, to watch my parents and sisters laugh and smile everywhere we go, I do meditation during transit/commute time between islands and such, playing meaningful music to listen to, and addiction self help stuff (posted by actual professionals on YouTube and such) and nothing. \n\n\nI know it‚Äôll take time to heal my brain. I fried it for 3 years (Covid loneliness threw me under the bus, but I take full responsibility still, I‚Äôm old enough and was aware of the risk, although I truly didn‚Äôt put 2+2 together those first couple of months, it‚Äôs like I completely forgot these blues are addictive as hell and cause physical dependence, i just lived in lala land despite having the knowledge in my brain. Guess I didn‚Äôt want to think about it or believe it ). \n\n\nThis time getting clean has also been different because this is the first time i did it for me myself and I and not some external excuse i made up for myself, like oh I should be clean for my sister‚Äôs wedding or i need to get clean if i want to be a mom ever, etc etc. this time it‚Äôs me getting clean because I have to. I have to save myself, there‚Äôs no one  coming to save me, it‚Äôs just me and whether or not i want to live life or numb myself to death in chains and shackles to a substance that will never love me back. It‚Äôs also been a bit different getting clean this time because there was no pink cloud phase at all, which previously Ive gotten around days 10-15 that feeling of freedom and empowerment which is a bit of a relief for a few days (not that it kept me from later relapsing but still, it‚Äôs something no?) ‚Ä¶.im thinking Maybe because my acute withdrawals were so mild (vitamin C god bless) I didn‚Äôt feel any significant physical relief and then no pink feels? Who knows \n\n\nMy only chance of keeping this sobriety going when i get back home to my dog and being on my own (family doesn‚Äôt live close) is the vivitrol pills I have. I HAVE to take them when I get back I‚Äôm so fucking scared that I won‚Äôt. \n\nThis post has no real point. Just sharing my shame and guilt.  And I am so sorry for everyone here who are worse off than I am. I‚Äôm logically appreciative of my situation but the feelings parts of my brain are all turned off still (outside of the one single feeling of shameful sadness) so I can‚Äôt feel appreciative. ",

    "selftext": "\n12/26 Journal Entry\n\nI began to see real progress when I followed a strict routine. During the three months I was institutionalized this year, I learned the importance of waking up early, working out, and eating nutritious meals. These habits, along with connecting with others, are essential to recovery.\n\nSobriety has opened my eyes to all the potential I wasted while using‚Äîneglecting my health, ignoring how to manage my mental health, and burning through money. But I know I am better than that.\n\nRight now, I feel stuck. I‚Äôm struggling financially‚Äîrent is due in a week, and I feel the pressure to hustle. Pawning my gold chain and watch is an option, but I don‚Äôt want to go that route. I need to find a way to move forward, not backward.\n\nIt‚Äôs clear that I can go back to having money without sabotaging myself with drugs. I need to stay focused and remember why I‚Äôm doing this: to create a stable life for myself and to help my family. But handling stress appropriately is something I still need to work on.\n\nBreaking the Cycle\n\nWhen I think negatively, it spirals into self-loathing, which triggers a dangerous cycle. My brain convinces me I‚Äôm a failure, which then tempts me to use drugs as a temporary escape. That cycle‚Äîgetting high, crashing, and repeating‚Äîhas taken a toll on me emotionally and physically.\n\nBut I‚Äôve learned that thoughts aren‚Äôt facts. Intrusive thoughts are just that‚Äîthoughts. I need to observe them, accept them, and not let them define me. By doing so, I give my brain space to acknowledge my strengths and dream of what I can accomplish.\n\nGrowth and Perception\n\nI‚Äôve grown in ways I didn‚Äôt think were possible. Some people may still see me as the person I was during my worst moments, but that‚Äôs okay. Their perception doesn‚Äôt define me. I know I‚Äôm actively working to rebuild myself and repair my mind.\n\nWhat matters is how I see myself: someone who is knowledgeable, trustworthy, and working hard to overcome their past. I‚Äôve made mistakes, but I‚Äôve also proven my good intentions time and time again.\n\nLessons from Recovery\n\nIn recovery, I‚Äôve learned there‚Äôs no drug that can fill the spiritual void inside. That emptiness can only be healed through genuine human connection, love, and building relationships with people who truly care about me.\n\nI‚Äôve also learned that I need to let go of resentment. Betrayal and disappointment from others don‚Äôt mean I can‚Äôt trust again. Not everyone is in competition with me. Just as I want to see others win, there are people who want to see me succeed too.\n\nMoving Forward\n\nLife is not about shortcuts. It‚Äôs about crawling up the stairs, slipping, falling, and getting back up. I‚Äôve learned to embrace the process, even when it‚Äôs hard.\n\nI know my strengths, and I know the areas I need to improve. I also know that rooting for others to fail is a waste of energy. Instead, I‚Äôll continue focusing on my growth and showing up as my best self.\n\nToday is Day 0. That‚Äôs not a failure‚Äîit‚Äôs a reset. Tomorrow can be Day 1. And the day after that, Day 2.\n\nI am not my mistakes. I am someone who is loved, someone who loves deeply, and someone who will rise again.",

    "title": "Opiates and anxiety",
    "selftext": "I need some guidance here, I'm at the end of my rope, and I dont know what to do.\n\nMy wife suffers from crippling anxiety, or so she says.  She's under a doctor's care, and has been for the last 10yrs or so.  She had a pretty rough childhood, abuse was involved.  Her mother passed away 7yrs ago, and she's been in a spiral every since.  She's always drank, a couple of beers a night after work, alot of beer and shots on the weekends.  It progressed to a six pack every night during the week, with some shots mixed in, to, up until February of this year, she was drinking an 18 pack every night, passing out on the couch, only to wake up a couple hours later and pop another top.  \n\nNow I'll get to where the opiates come into play...\n\nI suffered an injury at work about 10yrs ago, and unbeknownst to me, it broke my back, L3/L4.  I knew I hurt my back, but the didn't find it on the xrays.  I missed a few days of work, went back on light duty, and then just carried on like normal, albeit with some lingering pain.  Over the next couple of years, I'd complain to my regular doctor that my back hurt whenever I'd go in, and we just kind of chalked it up to getting older and my profession, I'm a mechanic, being hard on the body anyways.  It was gradually getting worse though, and I started having some numbness in my leg, and shooting pain every now and again if I moved the wrong way or whatever, and it was getting harder and harder to straighten out when I'd get out of bed in the morning, well, harder than it should be for a 45yr old, overweight albeit active guy.  My regular doctor wrote me for perc 10's, 3 times a day and I'd take them when I needed them and carry on.  5yrs ago, the leg numbness and shooting pain was getting so much worse that I was referred to a bone and joint doctor who did another round of test, and this time, found the break because the disk had blown out.  I ended up having a fusion surgery with a cage.  Leg numbness went away, but the back pain actually got worse.  Been on perc 10's, 4 times a day every since.\n\nBack to the wife...she gets cyst on her ovaries, and when they bust, it's not real comfortable, im told.  She's asked me for a pain pill every once in a blue moon before, no biggie.  She's even went to the emergency room before because the pain was so bad.  She's also been to the bone and joint for degenerative disk disease.  That's what she says her diagnosis is.  They gave her some shots in her back, and referred her to pain management.  I'd say this started about 3.5yrs ago.  They put her on hydrocodone 5's, 3 times a day. \n\nI wasnt real happy with the pills and the alcohol together, but can you really tell an adult what to do?  She was working full time, and keeping up with her motherly and wifely duties for the most part, even though. The entire time she was in pain management, they were riding her ass for the amount of alcohol she was testing for in her urine test.  About 5 months in, she got in trouble for missing pill count, and then the next month, she got tossed for failing her drug test again for alcohol, and surprise, she tested positive for percoset as well as the hydrocodone she was prescribed.  That's when I figured out she was stealing pills from me.  We fought about it, I bought a little cheap safe, she got enrolled into another pain management center, and everything went back to the way it was, or so I thought.  When she got back into pain management, she got the doctor to put her on percoset instead of hyrocodone, and I should have seen that as a red flag.  The safe I bought was just one of those little cheap safes from Walmart with the key pad and a key hole, and apparently they were really easy to break into, because she was stealing pills from me again, while I was at work, and while I slept.  You can see where this is going.  She's completely hooked now.  She says that none of her \"head\" doctors will listen to her, and none of the medications they prescribed her does anything for her anxiety, and she overtakes her pain medicine because it's the only thing that works, which I know is just a bullshit excuse to feed her addiction.  I would go as far to say that the majority of her anxiety now revolves around her addiction, where she's going to get her next fix, how she's gonna tell me that it's day 9 into her prescription, she's on 7.5's now, and she's out of pills....\n\nI guess one of the things that passes me off alot is, she checked herself into a mental health facility back in February and they helped her kick the alcohol, which is good, but she left out the part that she was addicted to pain pills, so they continued to give them to her while she was in there, and when she got out, she just replaced the alcohol with that many more pills.  She's slamming percosets, muscle relaxers, they have her on gabapentin for her anxiety, some other sleep medicine, and nothing is enough.  She's spending between $1k-$1500 a month on pills from a dealer she's found.  She's completely ruined us financially, my credit is completely shot from all of our bills being constantly late from her leaving us broke all the time.  We fight constantly because I am completely over all of this shit.  All of my close friends that know what's going on tell me I should leave her.  I'm at the point where I don't know, even if she gets clean, if I can get over all the damage she's done.  I don't trust her at all.  Take away her drug addiction, she's a great mother, but I'd be lying if I said they haven't had to do without because of all this.  She's done all the emergency room visits to get dope, she's checked herself back into treatment (for anxiety) numerous times just because she out of pills and can't get any, and she knows they'll give her what's she's prescribed while she's in there.  I can't make her leave our house, and I cant walk away from our house with the kids.  We don't live in a single income house either, so I feel like I'm stuck in her addiction with her.\n\nShe started another fight today, Christmas, while our oldest was here with the grand baby, because she was out of pills, again, after buying (20) 2 days ago, because I wouldn't give her any of mine.  She left and went and checked herself back in, under the pretense that she's going to get help, only to text me 3hrs later and ask me if they just got her psyc meds right, would I help her get to her fill date so she could come home, and that she would \"be all better\"\n\n\nWhat do I do????",

    "selftext": "Is there such a thing as a taper actually making things more difficult than going cold turkey? Hopefully I can explain my thoughts on this. I've been on some pretty hefty prescribed pain meds for over 20 years but early this summer I decided to make a big change. I've since left the hell of being in a Pain Management Clinic and found a Nurse Practioner that was willing to work with me on a long taper. Her only disclaimer is no added comfort meds - only my monthly allotment of pain meds until entirely tapered off. She started me on a taper plan and I was off to the races. Honestly, things went surprisingly well and I was able to move faster than expected without any issues or slip ups. That was until I hit my current road block that seems like a monumental problem. For the last 3 months I've been stuck at 4 Percs a day and am due to step down to 3 a day next week. But for some reason EVERY.SINGLE.DAY of these last 3 months has felt like full blown withdrawl and I just can't get past it. The anxiety is absolutely ruining my life and I just don't understand it. This seemed like a long and generous taper, and I'm starting to question if I should just stop the meds altogether and rip the bandaid off.

The problem is, is my drug tests are still coming back positive for fentanyl, and not just low amounts, sometimes real high and sometimes real low. I am not using, I can't stress this enough, and I'm only on one other prescription besides the Suboxone and that's Seroquel, which wouldn't come back as a false positive, cuz that's what I thought, cuz I've heard of certain meds doing that. My boyfriend relapsed rather quickly after getting clean and he says it could be because he touches my subs and it is seeping in through the foil packaging. The foil package isn't open when he touches it either. The only thing I still do is I smoke weed but since my tests kept coming back positive I stopped buying it off the street and started only buying from the dispensary, (it is legal where I live) I also got rid of my old bongs and bowls cuz maybe there was fent residue in them? idk...and on top of that I stopped buying flower altogether and started only buying vapes or carts. My doctor, God bless her, believes me because she sees me weekly, I never miss an appointment, I'm never late for my appointments, I'm never tired or like not put together like I would be if I was high, and I'm holding down a full time job. But even she can't just continue to look the other way. I have been wracking my brain trying to figure out what is happening and I'm at a total loss. I also started to think that someone at the lab that I do my drug tests at was switching my urine cuz maybe they needed clean urine so I switched to doing mouth swabs through a different lab and still positive, lower amounts but still there. If someone could give me some advice or if this has happened to you, please help. Idk what to do, this is making me so crazy and it's depressing the hell out of me. I'm finally clean and doing the right thing and I have nothing to show for it. ",

    "selftext": "This is a long one. Sorry. \n\nIn the last year, I have lost the 2 things that I love the most-'A girl that I fell in love with in high school, and heroin. Now, I am 53, penniless and living in my mother's basement.\n\n I have been out of my last rehab for about 10 months. It was, I think, my 5th rehab and my 9th or 10th detox in the last 10 years.  I didn't know that they put 20mg of oxycodone in a little blue pill til I was in my 40s, Thank JunkieJezus for that, anyway. I enjoyed a job that I loved and traveled for many years before I fucked up. I am lucky in that respect. \n\nThe day that I got out of (the last) rehab, I came home (to my girlfriend's house- I snorted mine years ago) I was drunk, went straight out to my truck and started snorting the corners of dirty bags. She found me breathing but unresponsive when I didn't show up to bed. She didn't call 911 because I was breathing.  I woke up to her standing over me, the next morning.  After a month of me running out and scoring whenever she turned her back, she finally had enough and asked me to leave. That is how I ended up here. \n\nEven here, I found a way to score.  My mother, out of the goodness of her heart, gives me $100/week cigarette and pocket money. I found that if I slowed my smoking down, I could get 6 packs of cigarettes, gas and 2 points from a dealer 40 miles away. So I did. I sold a few things over the past few months and stretched that into a 2 to 4 point a day habit.  Granted, that is better than a gram or two a day, but it has been enough to hook me again. Today, I am two days clean and fighting every minute not to run up the interstate.\n\nThis withdrawal is subtle, but just as hard to go through as when I was at my worst. Although my sleep is non-existent and I have the usual gut issues, I am determined this time. I think. I have finally realized just how much I took for granted, my entire life. At night, my mind is on a loop, thinking about just how bad I have fucked up and ways that I can try and fix things, but, if I am honest with myself, the rest of my life is going to be different, and not in a good way. But I understand now that I have to stop this. It wasn't the numerous rehabs and really shitty detoxes that did it. It was losing the only girl that I loved in my life 3 days ago that helped me find my rock bottom. And I am firmly planted here, at the moment.  And I need to thank her for that. I am not saying that you have to hit rock bottom to get clean. I honestly don't believe that.  But I certainly did. If I learned one thing over the last decade is that addiction is a very personal and different experience for different people. And that experience evolves for the individual.  I honestly hope that your experience evolves quicker than mine. I  love heroin.  And I probably always will. But just as she cut me out of her life to better herself, I have to finally break up with heroin. \n\nA week sounds like a long time even though it wasn't that long ago that doing without it that long was easy for me. A month sounds impossible.  But if I can make it to that month on my own, I think that I might be ok. I thought seriously about ending things to make it easier for all involved Saturday night, but I don't feel that anymore.  I just have to do the best that I can and hope that it is good enough for everybody else. \n\nI hope that this helps someone else who is traveling the same road as me. Unless you have a Mexican uncle who supplies you for free, you will never have enough resources to maintain this habit. And if you think that you can exist with a foot in each world, trust someone who thought that for a decade- you can't.  That first bag will drag you over and wants to kill you. \n\nGood luck, regardless of what road you end up taking. And, if you made it this far, wish me luck.  I would appreciate it.  \n\n",

In the years since, hes had about every bad thing happen to him that can happen to someone with a poly drug addiction. His life would fall apart, hed go to rehab, get a job and car and apartment. Then hed go back out, crash the car, lose the job and end up homeless. Like 20 times of that cycle. You guys know how it goes. So the last time he ended up in the hospital with sepsis and multiple infections, mrsa, wounds, the works. He wasnt expected to survive. His mom didnt bother coming around. His dad came by and told him 'looks like youre not going to make it so im going to turn in the plates on your car.' P said ok. Nothing else to say i guess.  Idk why, but that hit me hard. \n\nSo hes made it over 2 years sober now. Hes a carpenter now, works for a builder and hes a foreman. He and his mom bought a townhouse together. Last time i talked to him when right when he got out of the hospital. Hadnt seen him in probably 7 or 8 years.\n\nHes just such a great person, kind of a space cadet, so funny and under it all just a really caring sweet fun guy. Im just so thankful to see him doing good. I was thinking about it this morning and came to tears, thinking about how his addiction has caused him to suffer all these years. \n\nI was really thankful to see him. It was so nice to sit down and talk recovery and life with him and our other friend, who doesnt have any addictions, but is as caring and understanding as a 'normie' can be.

Plus I'm not even 4 months clean yet, gotta remind myself of that too especially when things get dark (like for example I'm NOT going to kill myself but I do seem to think about dying a lot, not necessarily by suicide.  I think I'm getting better though).  A lot of times I'm just flooded (sometimes all day) with angry, negative thoughts, usually when thinking about my family/childhood home.   I've always been that way.  Im trying to escape this paradigm the only ways that I've found through my research.  Not sure what I'm asking, if this is even a question, idk.  Anyway I've been seriously considering Sublocade a lot recently (Im pretty sure I have PAWS) and I think my final answer is no.  I'm just afraid of losing certain things I lost last time I was using (nitazenes), like appetite and desire to read and write.  The line of work I'm about to get into requires a lot of that.

    "selftext": "Hey guys. Its usually me who gave people hope here in this sub, convincing them that the withdrawals will get better soon but I feel like I am the one in need of help once again. \n\nI did something I never imagined before. I still remember how I snorted 10x80mg Oxy pills a day and was certain I will never get off of it due the immense pain and duration and was absolutely sure I would never feel normal again. But no, i kicked that crap CT, sleep very good, my body causes zero problems and I think I would feel overall pretty good right now, if I havent destroyed my former life with the addiction. \n\nIf everything would be alright, I dont think I would even think of pills, but I never needed something to cope with in life than now. I had such a great life before my addiction went out of control. 130k dreamcar, self employed with online business (I was lucky with some faceless social media pages I was running and earned tons of ad revenue), had a loving gf, financial freedom, free time on mass, traveling the world. I never needed the pills because I was depressed or something, but they turned me into an very active and talkative guy who felt like rainbows day in and day out. Life felt like paradise. This was my life for years and years with the demon acting like my best buddy on this trip, soothing me in his warm blanket, turning me into that extrovert I really liked. \n\nOf course tolerance got the best of me and my social media business died completely. The pages will never ever get the same revenue like before. My girlfriend broke up, I snorted all my savings away, they took away my car because I wasnt able to pay the montly rate anymore (Ive pumped like 60k into that car, everything gone. They sold the car for a low price and now want another 10.000 from me. 70.000 down the drain). I lost my beloved appartment and if it wasnt for my parents, I was homeles by now. I just wish they werent toxic and overprotective, because they make me feel bad and like a teenage boy with my 30 years of age whenever I want to meet some friends \"You just want to get drugs with your friends! We gave you a second chance but you will apply to our rules now!\" They believe completely isolating me from the outside world is the best solution for me and they just got the upper hand because I am highly in debt and cant affort my own appartment anymore. Day in day out I see the same faces, the same 4 walls.\n\nI only feel like the shadow of my former self. I  feel like this was the peak of my life and I will never get it back. Life will suck from here on and I will always chase the good old days. Its like going into a all-in war for months and months and surviving it, feeling like a great warrior (the detox) just to come back to your hometown and you see its all nuked away and you ask yourself \"what was I fighting for?\". The withdrawals, the cravings.. like all of that wouldnt be a master-level challenge, no I also need to deal with the lowest life I ever had additionally on top of it. I even destroyed my teeth. Ive got cavities on my front teeth because I was too lazy while withdrawing. It looks so ugly....among everything else about the \"new me\". Gained 15kg of weight, belly looks like about to explode. At the mid-game of my addiction I was looking like a Greek god, working out a lot. All I see now is a mentally broken fat guy in is 30's, who invested his last 10 years into online business which just died out, wondering what kind of non-depressive job he can do now, while the social anxiety and depression is higher than ever and -30.000 on his bankaccount. I cant even go buy a dollar chocolate. Its so pathetic.\n\nI dont even need to be that rich guy again. I just want my normal life back. I cant even date anymore because I cant pay for my teeth to get fixed and I feel fat Af. I dont even have a car anymore. Who the fuck would date a guy like me?. Whats the point of my life from here on?  The demons voice in my head is getting louder again. \"Imagine how the first pill would feel like. Imagine getting a break from all the stress.\" Or stupid things like \"use Kratom, just a little bit. Just until you get back on your feets again in life\". \n\nit for sure wont happen tomorrow, nor next week... but I feel like the louder the voice gets, the closer I am to a relapse again. being punished for a year now with the things I destroyed in my life with no light at the end of the tunnel. I really know what this shit brought into my life. I really want to stay clean and its actually a blessing to wake up with no withdrawals at all. \n\nBut I feel like I wont randomly relapse because of boredom or cravings, but because I just got sick and tired of hoplessly trying to fix my life. Other people are marrying in my age and here I am, in a prematured Midlife crysis. ",

But relapsed immediately and have been back to using these 2 weeks since.   \nVisited an outpatient today that advertised a buprenorphine 5-7 day detox, but found out the \"detox\" part was misleading and it's essentially like a methadone program (sick for 2 days, come in daily for 5-7, stabilize, get on script and then slowly taper off over months).\n\nMy only experience with subs is getting a script many years ago and I got sick as a dog likely from precipitated withdrawal.

The narcan is 3 stories down in the hotel parking lot. That might as well be in fucking bangcock. I feel the feeling of death creep into my psyche. This cannot be happening. I think of the phone call to my mom i will have to make.   Everything looked like it was melting. My world was melting. I wish i was never born.\n\nI grab my 2009 satur vue keys and bust through the door then my stomach drops as i almost let the door close without having the room key. That would be instant death for my brother and probably suicide for me if that door closed. I take my shoes and wedge them so it doesnt shut and i fucking run. It was the longest run ill ever have to run. Each step a eternity. Dread filled my nostrils as tears jetted down my sunken face. Run faster you fuck!  I see my dented saturn. I tear apart the dash and grab the narcan. Its august and its hot and its probably 2am and my brother is in our hotel room dying.

If hell had a feeling. This was it\n\nI ram through the door like a skinny minature tweaker kool aid man. Hes in the same locked up rigamortis position.

Please dont leave me here alone on this weird fucked up planet!!! Im crying as i give cpr. I look at his pale blue face and i slap it hard as i can i punch him in the stomach angry and hoping it will trigger something and he wont die. I try dragging him to the shower but alas im not strong enough im screaming for help. It feels like this is a  cruel joke. Where the fuck are you ashton!!@ i continue cpr for probably 10 minutes.

Then the best sound I‚Äôve ever heard graced my ears. Like a hoover vacuum, he took a deep inhale and started choking. I collapse against the wall and look at him while he takes in his surroundings.  ‚ÄúWhat happened fuck did i overdose?‚Äù He says angerly. I nod. He comes over and lifts me up and says ‚Äù im so sorry dude i didnt mean to put you through that. Thank you for saving my life‚Äù while he hugs me. A wave of relief washes over my body.

    "selftext": "Quite the read so please bare with me, any feedback and hearing of similar stories would be greatly appreciated!  \n  \n**A little about me -**\n\nI live in Thailand but was born and raised in California, USA. I have dual citizenship and have access to the universal healthcare out here and was getting Fentanyl 50mcg for free but man what PITA process to get it even though I used it RESPONSIBLY, freaking stigma...\n\n**Summary of my Issues -**\n\nI was prescribed 50mcg of Fentanyl for 11 years for chronic pain in my upper body (pinched nerves). I never misused it (never increasing dose or applying earlier than needed), keeping daily logs tracking everything I do going back to the 2010s, including when I'd apply new patches. Long story short, I decided to stop last month on November 21st while using 5mg of Methadone to help. The first week was good; I actually felt better, but then started experiencing major aches and pains on the 8th and 9th days until I found workarounds. I read that what I went through is called the 'honeymoon phase,' as I initially felt great at the beginning but felt worse afterward. I feel no cravings or urge for Fentanyl, but unfortunately, physical dependence has taken hold and it's affected my sleep.\n\nThe worst of the withdrawal symptoms seems to be over after a month since stopping. Sleep WAS good but worsened at the start of December. No matter what time I go to bed (and I've tried sleeping much earlier to compensate, around 8-8:30 PM but before 9 PM), my sleep has been all over the place, ranging from 3 to 7 hours, with 7 being the cap. I keep waking up at 2-3 AM despite following advised sleep habits. My nighttime medication consists of 3mg of Xanax, 2mg of Klonopin, and 15mg of Remeron since 2013.\n\nI've been adopting new habits to help me function during the day, like drinking lots of water, practically cutting out soda, and doing stretches to help with aches and pains while also boosting my energy levels. However, after being up for 10-12 hours, I'm gassed and retreat to bed for the rest of the day, vegging out on videos until sleep.\n\nThe past few days, it seems like my sleep has worsened even though I keep everything consistent at night, as over the past few nights my sleep has went like this in the following order from most recent to earlier in the month ‚Äì\n\n* 3 hours 38 minutes just last night, (December 20 / 21)\n* 5 hours 48 minutes,\n* 3 hours 51 minutes,\n* 4 hours 46 minutes,\n* 7 hours,\n* 3 hours 19 minutes,\n* 5 hours,\n* 6 hours,\n* 5 hours 35 minutes (December 13)",

    "selftext": "Since I was 16 years old opiates have been a monumental part of my life. I started by taking my mom's old oxys that she would stash for herself. But when that dried up I moved on to Percocets that I would get from my friends at school. The next two years spiraled into a never-ending cat-and-mouse game of me trying to hide my use from the people in my life. I went as far as to intentionally isolate myself from my family and my friends just so I could be alone and nod out for a little while longer. Sadly this habit was never discovered by my parents or any significant figure. I remember this time in my life vividly, and with that, I remember my attitude towards my addiction. The intense denial I was in still makes me say out loud \"What the fuck was I thinking\".\n\n And then one day in November of 2023 I od'd for the first time. I'll never forget the fear I felt when I found out what happened, in that moment I don't think I couldve spoken if I wanted to, all I could do was cry and hold myself. That was the very first moment I accepted what was wrong with me. I spent the better part of December 2023 detoxing and let me tell you, it was a new circle of hell. I remember thinking to myself that this was worse than active addiction, I could feel every part of my body heating up like I was in the hottest sauna of my life but simultaneously I was shivering and felt an instinctive need to get warm, for lack of a better term it felt like hell froze over. \n\nThat's not me saying the next 11 months were any easier, it wasn't. Every little thing made me think of percs I remember sitting in class and feeling this overpowering urge to get high again. I felt so bad, it felt like every part of my body was tingling with an intense mental and physical pain, a pain that would only be relieved if I just picked up my phone and called my plug. But by some stroke of luck or maybe divine intervention (If you're big into religion) I stayed clean.\n\n And now here I am, 19 years old and officially one year clean off opiates. I still get those urges from time to time especially if I am bored at the house with nothing to do and I've accepted that this will be a factor that I will deal with for the rest of my life and I'm ok with it, but as I've gone longer and longer without using I've found more and more ways to mentally tell myself NO! Nobody in my life that is significant like my mom or my friends knows this fact about me so I figured this is the best place to share! I still smoke weed, drink and every once in a while I'll do psychedelics with my friends but I made this promise to myself: I will never use opiates for recreational use ever again! And I will do everything in my power to keep that promise no matter what happens.",

My daughter sleeps 12 hours a night and I get at least 8 hours of sleep a night and I still wake up exhausted. Has anyone else experienced this? If so, what did you do. I would try anything to be able to wake up in the morning and just be ready for the day. If I sit on the couch I will fall asleep at any point throughout the day. My mom has even taken my daughter for the day so I could sleep. It doesn't help no matter how much I sleep I'm exhausted. I am scheduled for a sleep study consultation but that's not until May 12th. So any advice or insight would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",

I had a legal script for \\[240\\] percocet and \\[40\\] XTAMPA monthly. This was over a \\[5\\] year period of time. If there are any doctors reading this, i would love to hear any ideas on molecular damage repair recommendations you may have to help repair the inevitable damage done. Having said this, i have always had 'bad feet' meaning they were physically hard to walk on for the 1st 20 minutes of every day and began to ache throughout the day.  I also had 5th disease about 20 years ago and it was feet related and painful as heck for about 2 weeks. I went to a place that a friend recommended for my feet - and what do you know - the physician researched and found that my feet condition may be related to inflammation though i did not feel inflamed at all.  The physician prescribed LDN - low dose naltrexone. The catch is - LDN blocks the brain's opioid receptors that are served by the OXY so detox is immediate and believe me - INTENSE. BUT...it gets you past all the mindf\\*ck of tapering AND the LDN produces 'natural' endogenous opiates and boosts endorphin production LDN . My shoulder still has pain - but not constant and its much more manageable and my feet feel great for the first time in 20 years. If you really want to  kick Opiates - find you a doctor that is open to prescribing LDN - there is a very 'slight' euphoric aspect to LDN - sort of like runners high - but its not subject to abuse. BTW, I did 4.5mg of LDN 1.5mg \\[3\\] times a day for \\[7\\] days and I was 'off' oxy. Though I will say it did take my full mind and body about \\[6\\] months to feel in synch. Its hard to explain - but OXY was doing a lot of internal changes physically and mentally and its taken far longer than i would have thought to feel 'normal'.  I hope this story helps someone out there!",

The article is probably behind their paywall so I thought I'd outline their most serious transgressions for anyone who hasn't read it.\n\n- Giving methadone to cocaine and methemphatime addicts who tested negative for opioids. Management berates staff for turning away prospective patients because clinic Directors got monetary bonuses based on increases in patient enrollment\n- Unlicensed workers handing out methadone after all of their nurses quit, this led to patients getting double dosed and an episode where a child got into a dosing room and grabbed a cup of methadone, luckily someone noticed. \n- Falsifying counseling hours and over billing insurers, counselors felt pressured to do this and were punished if they didn't \n- Overbilling for blood and urine tests, they paid a $17mn fine for this\n- Hiring counselors without proper credentials\n- Counselors with caseloads double the state maximum, in most states the max is 60, Acadia counselors have upwards of 120 patients and work less than 40 hours a week\n- Falsifying treatment plans, completing them without the patient being present. They cut and paste from old treatment plans or make information up, they also did this with counseling notes.\n\nAcadia is the largest chain of methadone clinics in the country, they have 165 clinics in 33 states and they're certified by Carf. In 2 years Acadia has generated $1.3bn dollars. lt's worth mentioning that Acadia is owned by Bain Capital, a private equity firm and it looks like they're angling to get some of the $50 million dollars in opioid settlement money. There are no Acadias in my state, and although I've seen some shady shit at my clinic I've never seen anything on this level, I'm curious if anyone here has been a patient at one of their clinics and if you have what was your experience like?\n",

    "selftext": "TLDR: I'm curious about different detox scenarios and if you've been given comfort meds at detox or by a PCP to detox off MAT/opioids? Meds like phenobarbital, benzos, muscle relaxer, sleep meds or anything legit to help get you through the misery of it besides a quick buprenorphine taper? \n\n--------\n\nThis may be controversial to ponder, and I'm not saying I condone it, but I wonder how many people have chosen to end it just to prevent going through cold turkey withdrawals? \n\nI don't think I've ever read a statistic on that type of sewer slide. I wouldn't be surprised for an instant if many of ODs were actually that. And honestly that term slow sewer slide really is what so many of us are doing at the end of our addiction...just waiting on it to end bc we can't bear the misery of withdrawal in order to get free. \n\nWhich is why I the stigma should be removed from addiction & MAT...but even with MAT, there should be a better plan to get people off instead of cold turkey or long drawn out tapers. More detoxes that offer comfort meds or PCP Doctors that will help you get through it instead of treating you like a drug seeker bc you want something absurd and minimal like 5 benzos or 10 muscle relaxers or sleep meds for the first 2 weeks. I'm not even saying those RX should be the standard, but I imagine they would help folks be more successful than nothing at all.\n\nI've never went to detox but my partners have. Neither of them ever got true comfort meds until my ex went last time.  The detox thought he was there for alcohol primarily, but he was also at the end of a rapid methadone taper.  he said all the heroin/opioid addicts besides him just had to suffer through it, but he was given all kinds of comfort meds. They put him on a 7 day suboxone taper, phenobarbital, clonidine, and trazodone. I believe the first few days he even got benzos.  But he was there almost 30 days waiting for a bed to open at a sober living facility, so I'm not sure his experience was the norm or exactly how the medications were administered. He also left with a Rx for celexa and trazodone, which he said the trazodone really helped him sleep the first 6 months. \n\nHe said the methadone detox was nothing with the comfort meds they gave him. He didn't pick dope back up for 2 years now and has been free of all opioids since then. \n\nHis success and the way he said it was no big deal at all made me think maybe I could get there one day if I was given a similar regimen. \n\nBut I never hear about people getting comfort meds like that when they go to detox...\n\nso I'm asking you guys...what was your detox situation like? or have you ever had a doctor give you comfort meds beyond clonidine to help get off heroin or methadone? \n\nI've even heard there is a newer drug used for the worst withdrawals during the first two weeks called Lucemyra but it's so expensive most can't afford it and insurance won't cover it. I know one person specifically who tried to get it and couldn't. \n\nAnyways yeah if you read all that and want to share your experiences please let me know there is some hope to not go through the absolute hell that is withdrawals to free yourself from opioid addiction as I approach 5 years free of heroin and being oh so ready to stop methadone but having no real exit strategy besides a miserable long drawn out taper.

Started with roxys then moved to heroin for a while then got clean and my fiance passed away and moved into fentanyl. Ive cold turkeyed Roxys, Suboxone and Heroin and the longest I ever stayed clean was 6 months off heroin. Well the last 3 years I never realized how bad death had affected me because following my fiances death I had 2 of my closest friends die. One was murdered and the other was left to OD on fent. \n\nFollowing that I went on an extreme downward spiral of smoking fent and meth every day for about 3 years. I even got caught and was facing a charge which could have got me 3 years in prison (drug dealing). I thankfully had the opportunity to move which also helped alot. This last time I was working to get off methadone, fent and meth which i did in about 30 days. I then get off suboxone at about 45 days. It was not easy and i had alot of stomach issues for a majority of the time. Now i am sitting here at about 90 days and have never looked back. This has been the first time i really seeked help from God and he answered back. Had some crazy dark shit occur in the first few weeks of getting soberwhich opened my eyes to how evil and dark the world of fent is and how bad i needed help from God.

Ive been clean from subs for about a month now. I couldnt defy biology alone but with Gods help and the want and need for a new life. Ive walked thru hell too many years and realized how real it is here and in the after life. God bless to all in recovery and i promise the pain will go away.

I also never touched anything stronger than weed until in my 30s, so I had established pretty responsible habits and management of priorities. So far, my addiction hasn't changed that. I'm fortunate enough to have a job bartending and I make excellent money doing so. It's also helpful making cash everyday.\n I've been with the same employer since 2015 and I'm very grateful for the job, so it's been very important I don't let my addiction and job bleed into each other. I have not allowed drugs to make my morals negotiable, like justifying stealing and such to satisfy my habit. I work for what I have just the same as I always did.\n\nAll that said, I'm tired of spending all my extra money on dope. I'm tired of the chase. I'm tired of being terrified I'm one traffic stop away from being outed and a felon.\n\nMy problem is that going to rehab would in essence take away everything I've worked so hard to keep heroin from taking from me. Id lose my apartment with no one/no way to pay rent. I'd lose my vehicle for the same reason. It's a buy here pay here with a weekly payment. And then there's my job and either lying and taking excessive time off without valid explanation, or telling the truth and tarnishing the reputation I have worked almost a decade to earn. \n\nI'm thinking about trying methadone. I know some may not see that as sober, but its definitely not being on heroin everyday either. I just can't accept fighting to protect everything I value from heroin just to lose it trying to get sober.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n***********Post update **********\"*\nToday is day 12 on methadone and I am so fucking thankful. I went to a clinic the next morning. I wasn't aware I was supposed to make an appointment and was worried I'd be turned away. However, I told the woman at the desk the truth, that I was truly afraid if I didn't start that morning I might never walk back into the building. That beautiful angel of a woman pulled some strings and made sure I got admitted into their methadone progam that same day. First two days were the toughest so far. I was more uncomfortable than I maybe had anticipated to be honest, but I just kept reminding myself how much more uncomfortable I'd be if I was raw dogging it and I got through it. A huge help for each day has been this post and all of the wonderful advice and love each of you sent my way. No shit, I've come back to this post and reread every single one of these amazing comments every fucking day since I started.  Some days even two or three times. It's just the beginning and I have no doubts that harder days will come, but I'm just worried about today and today I'm sober from heroin/fentanyl and each of you had a hand in that, so thank you. ",

I‚Äôd desperately scroll through the success stories on here and some times (most times üòí), I‚Äôd end up even more depressed because those dreams & goals I saw were so out of reach.\n\nI ended up sitting alone in a subletted apartment, with no food in the fridge, and a coffee table littered with the remaining detritus from my use. I was in full blown withdrawals from a shitty recreational opioid that had its nasty claws in me after my safe, ‚Äúnon street‚Äù sources had run dry.\n\nClimbing the walls, I picked up the phone: I was either calling an ambulance to come get me, or I was reaching out to a woman who had helped others here (in my tiny little state), and advocated harm reduction. I chose the latter. She saved my life. And then my Subs doctor save my life.\n\nI *could not* stop on my own. Transitioning onto Suboxone saved my life. But, it came with a whole other host of issues. After about a year, I began suffering from heightened anxiety as well as *SEVERE* constipation. A month ago, I made the decision to try and stop my dosage because the side effects were too much.\n\nI can‚Äôt really share how I got off Suboxone. The process was convoluted and to be honest, my methods were unorthodox. But here I am, fifteen days after my last dose.\n\nI feel okay. And I just recently came to believe that I deserve the kindness and good treatment I give out to other people. I deserve good things. I deserve recovery.\n\nSo (and I know this sounds corny af), if you are on here, feeling desperate, maybe feeling sick, too, please please please know that your life will get, and be better. You deserve it to.\n\nI‚Äôm kinda shell shocked that I made it out. I woke up today at 37, without much (or anything) to really show after losing over 25 years to addiction. But I feel free.

I know I should not come to reddit for medical advice but I'm hoping to come across anyone with a similar story. As stated earlier I am heavily addicted to Kratom. I take about 10 500mg capsules every 4-6 hours. If I miss said dose I get nauseous, feel like my skin is on fire and get irritable. I generally drink 1 20oz glass of 2-3 shots of vodka with cranberry every night before bed. I just found out I'm 6 weeks pregnant. My S.O. and I had been trying for 8 years, at least 1 year before I started this kratom habit to manage chronic back pain. I had given up hope. I had gastric bypass about a year ago and began taking kratom shortly after and have been heavily addicted ever since. My S.O. says that we do not have the financial means to carry the pregnancy, along with the worry that I have already done damage to this fetus. I spoke with an ER doc today and he said so long as I can get clean within the next couple of weeks, he thinks I can have a healthy pregnancy. My S.O. vehemently disagrees. I think he 1. Doesn't want another child with me despite being on board before the addiction, and 2. Thinks 90k a year combined is not enough income for a baby. \n\nI want this baby. More than anything. But I cannot afford to do it on my own. I don't think I could forgive myself for terminating a pregnancy that I've hoped for so strongly for the past 8 years. I'm worried that no matter what decision I make, resentment will build between the two of us. I am 100% committed to getting clean and having a healthy pregnancy. That being said, I do have bipolar depression of which I take many medications for and I am terrified of getting off of them and turning into the monster I was during my first pregnancy when I was undiagnosed. Any advice would be so greatly appreciated. Please be kind. I know I'm a shit person with a dependency I shouldn't have if there was even a chance I could get pregnant.

My story with opiates is quite a long one but I'll try keep it short.\n\nI was prescribed 30mg Codeine and later 30mg Dihydrocodeine since my teens for migraines. \n\nI am now 34 and only slipped into opiate addiction 4 years ago. It started with experimenting with pain meds, and that recreational use was just occasional and never experienced withdrawals. Then Christmas day of 2021 I had my first withdrawals after a few weeks of using Morphine. It was a surprise because I had binged opiates in the past and never had withdrawals or addiction. From there I began using morphine, Dihydrocodeine, or Oxy daily. 6 months ago I switched to Heroin and now I am beginning my Detox. \n\nI have booked 7 days from work and plan to just go cold turkey and white knuckle it. \n\nI am staying at a friend's house so I am far away from my dealers. I have deliberately booked my week off so I have no responsibilities other than just focusing on not using any opiates over these 7 days. \n\nI have been told I will likely be over the worst of the physical symptoms but am expecting to feel lacking in energy and have mood issues for a while(some says months, others say up to year or more). \n\nI am prepared for the worst and honestly excited to just get my life back. \n\nWhat I want to understand is if I will ever be able to use my migraine medication again? I usually take 30-120mg of Dihydrocodeine as prescribed, usually once or twice a month when I get a migraine. \nI have intentionally paused my script while I do my withdrawal and plan to just suffer through any migraines I get for while, just back to normality. \n\nAfter 3 weeks, once my body is no longer dependent. Would I be able to take my migraine medication( one dose one day) or would my body experience withdrawal symptoms if I did this? \n\nI understand there is the risk that 1 day becomes two, two becomes three and then its a slippery slope of addiction again. \n\nFor decades I had no withdrawal symptoms sticking to my dosing as advised by my doctor. But I am not sure that once you have had addiction whether your neurochemistry changes meaning that any opiate means immediate withdrawal symptoms even if only one dose is taken one one day, once to twice a month(always with a week or two between doses).

    "selftext": "My therapist recently flipped the way I think about cravings, and it‚Äôs made a huge difference. I‚Äôd been telling him how much I was fighting my cravings for my drug of choice, and he gave me a completely different perspective:\n\n**\"Don't fight your craving...welcome them to your dinner party, give them a VIP seat, they aren't your enemy...don't be rude.\"**\n\nHere‚Äôs the analogy he shared: Picture your craving as if it was someone stopping by your house uninvited. Instead of slamming the door in their face or arguing with them, you say, ‚ÄúCome on in, take a seat. Tell me what‚Äôs on your mind.‚Äù You acknowledge their presence, hear them out, ask if they want coffee, they have every right to be heard. Then politely let them know you have other plans but appreciate them stopping by and let them know they're always welcome back, anytime.\"  \n\nIt sounds strange, but this kills the anxiety that normally comes with my cravings.  Because I try to shake them...but they KEEP coming back stronger....and stronger...until...I sometimes use.  But now I don't fight them, or even try to shake them....welcome in homie, I just made coffee!  You like cream or sugar or black?  \n\nThe craving didn‚Äôt disappear instantly, but it didn‚Äôt feel overwhelming anymore. The anxiety eased, and I could actually move on without feeling like I was in a full-blown battle.\n\nSo, next time you‚Äôre dealing with a craving, try this: Picture it as an unexpected guest. Let it pull up a chair, hear it out, and calmly remind yourself you‚Äôre not buying what it‚Äôs selling. The more you practice this, the more those cravings lose their grip.\n\nHope this helps someone out there struggling‚Äîyou‚Äôre stronger than you think. Stay kind to yourself!",

    "title": "If drugs are the solution, then what is the problem?",
    "selftext": "A common saying in the recovery community is something to the effect of \"drugs weren't my problem, they were my solution.\"\n\nI feel that this was true for me. In fact, I made a list of the problems I had, in the general order in which they came up, and for which drugs were my solution - even if this \"solution\" inevitably created more problems. \n\nMy problems came in three stages: early, middle, and end-stage addiction. I found this to be a useful exercise for reflection and recommend you try it. Feel free to add your thoughts to the comments if nowhere elseüëá \n\nEARLY ADDICTION: EXPERIMENTATION AND SNIFFING OXY\n\nANXIETY: being struck with sudden and overwhelming self-awareness at 14 led to a strong sense of anxiety. Self-medicating with opioids made this discomfort fade away. After sniffing some oxy, I could crack jokes with zero inhibition, and not a care in the world what you thought about me either way. Anxiety was my initial problem, and opioids were a bonafide solution.\n\nLOW SELF-ESTEEM: I was a people pleaser from the rip; this was my second big problem. I always loved making people laugh and impressing people when I was younger. I worried about what other people thought about me and didn't ever think about what I thought about myself. \n\nLow self-esteem was fertile ground for the roots of addiction and opioids were an ultra-potent fertilizer, since they gave me a positive feeling about myself that I wasn't achieving elsewhere. They made me feel powerful. This quickly led to another problem: my self-esteem would slip away when I wasn't high. The vicious cycle begins.\n\nWOMEN: This must be mentioned early on in this list. One of my favorite things about opioids initially was the feeling that they gave me around women. Ultra-confident, silver-tongued, carefree, and with the ability to please her for longer than two minutes (lol). Opioids gave me a feeling of emotional invincibility. They quickly became a necessity for any social event with women present, and absolutely mandatory for any date type situation.\n\nLACK OF IDENTITY: adolescence is a crucial time in which humans naturally specialize into a field, historically speaking. Gone are the days of the adolescent son rubbing shoulders with his master blacksmith father and learning what it means to be a blacksmith. I had no mentorship or apprenticeship experience of any sort - I doubt many teenagers do these days, especially those that wind up addicted.\n\nMy lack of an intrinsic sense of identity and external specialization led me to quickly adopt the identity of psychonaut and drug user, which eventually led to the identites of drug dealer, drug educator, street pharmacist, and eventually \"addict\" (a label i no longer identify with)\n\nIDLE TIME: I played sports when I was younger and was athletic but quit several sports and didn't push myself hard. My parents let me quit and didn't push me either. I'm not blaming them, just mentioning it as I believe this \"idle time\" was indeed the devil's workshop for me. \n\nI see kids these days involved in extracurriculars and can't help but wonder what my life could've been like if I had more structure and accountability. Instead of going to practice after school, I would get high with my buddies once high school ended and immediately become ultra-focused on the hustle and bustle of the drug game.\n\nIMPAIRED SALIENCE BASED ATTENTION SYSTEM AKA ADHD: High school did not hold my attention. The idea of going to college and earning a degree wasn't salient / attention-grabbing to me. I wanted a lot of money and power, fast, and the drug game offered the risks and excitement regular life couldn't hold a candle to. \n\nI was prescribed adderall for ADHD when I was younger but didn't like that it actually caused me to sit still and pay attention. Other kids would literally ask me what was wrong with me when I took it, so I stopped. My life would likely look very different had I just stayed on it and allowed myself to become a cog in the educational machine.\n\nGREED: Greed is defined as \"having or showing an intense and selfish desire for something, especially wealth or power.\" This describes exactly how i felt when i was younger, and it was obviously a huge problem. The strange combination of greed and low self-esteem can be a real killer. My value of self was determined by my ability to attain things, and on top of that, I truly and deeply desired wealth and power.\n\nSELFISHNESS: There is certainly such a thing as healthy selfishness, and unhealthy selflessness, but when I was in early addiction I was selfish to a fault. I felt that I was entitled to pleasure, status, and wealth. Thinking about it now makes me cringe.\n\nMIDDLE PHASE OF ADDICTION: ENTER HEROIN\n\nThere were problems I had before I picked up that led to me becoming an \"addict\". Being an \"addict\", however, also created a whole host of other problems - ironically and terribly, drugs were the solution for many of these problems as well.\n\nCHRONIC STRESS: using and selling drugs was incredibly stressful for me. There was the stress of the drug game - people trying to rob me, running around doing illegal shit, trying to avoid getting caught using by my family - and the incredible stress of the criminal justice system, in my case. \n\nI was arrested 4 times between the ages of 14 and 18, and had a 3 year suspended prison sentence hanging over my head while doing intensive outpatient and pissing multiple times a week for probation entering my adulthood. The stress was incredible. I could barely sleep. I had recurring dreams of having to fight in prison. Oxy - and then dope - helped it all fade away, if only for a blink and a nod.\n\nThis chronic stress might look totally different for someone else. Physical pain can be a big chronic stressor. Accumulated debts are another. Work and familial responsibilities have the potential to be unbelievably stress-inducing. A very common comorbidity with addictive disorders is PTSD. The trauma response results in elevated stress hormones aka chronic stress.\n\nDEPRESSION: Chronic stress directly causes depression; the medical literature is clear about that. When I was addicted and trying to quit, the depression was incredible. \n\nWhy get out of bed? What do I have to look forward to? Why fight? The lack of energy was palpable. I could barely will myself to breathe sober breaths. Simply smiling was a momentous task.\n\nNEGATIVE SELF-IMAGE: In the middle stage of addiction, I started to make some attempts to stop doing drugs. I couldn't. I felt like a fucking loser. I was a piece of shit. People told me I would be an \"addict\" for the rest of my life. People were watching me constantly, waiting for me to fuck up again, and I hated it all.\n\nAt a certain point, i felt like i might as well act like who i felt I was, and behave in accordance with what people were telling me that I was. One of the reasons I continued to use drugs was because I - and everyone around me - held the image of me as a person who uses drugs. I was going to be an \"addict\" forever, so why try to be anything else? This is a subtle, almost subconscious mental process that led me to unbelievable suffering and continuous relapse.\n\nCOMPULSIVENESS: I was likely predisposed to compulsiveness before I started getting high, but drugs made me unbelievably compulsive. I would smoke weed automatically if it were around me, even knowing that I didn't really like it or that it was going to make me anxious or that I could go to prison if i were caught. Opioids gave me a feeling of freedom from the compulsiveness, even if my behavior didn't change. I just felt like things were a little slower and that I was more in control, I suppose.\n\nOBSESSIVENESS: My thoughts became obsessive, to the point that I felt like I was going crazy. I would obsess over not doing drugs and then obsess over doing drugs in the very next moment. I felt no freedom of thought, my thoughts were automatic and cyclical in a way that would make me want to scream. Of course, the dope would quiet my mind - until it didn't (see end-stage addiction)\n\nBOREDOM: On days that i conquered the stress, depression, negative feelings of self, and drug-induced OCD, I would be confronted with an incredible boredom. Even smoking weed, eating chocolate cake, and playing halo 3 - which would have been heaven to me just a few years earlier - wouldn't satisfy me; and it would often just leave me burnt out and tired and feeling like even more of a loser. Boredom was one of a cluster of related problems, and they shared the same inevitable, predictable, sole solution: dope.\n\nLONELINESS: Boredom would be compounded by loneliness, and I knew that one of my homies was only a phone call away. I could call him, go pick him up, and then go get any number of substances, and ride around selling them and getting high and meeting all kinds of different people. To go from the loneliness and boredom to that social chaos on top of the high was nearly irresistable to me, especially as a person that had ADHD and drug-induced OCD.\n\nSENSATION SEEKING: this deserves to be on here because it is a real problem for many people trying to develop out of an addiction. I had to be able to accurately frame the \"chaos\" and \"fun\" of the drug game and see it for what it really is: an illusion. In reality, drug use is a monotonous treadmill of pain, loss, and perpetual dissatisfaction that exists on the edge of an eroding cliff.\n\nEND-STAGE ADDICTION: IV SPEEDBALLS AND XANAX\n\nLIFE: By the time I reached 12 years of addiction at age 26, I was just done with life. Being alive and conscious was the problem. My addiction crystallized and became all of me. \n\nLack of identity in the early stage had become a permanent and all-consuming Identity: I was nothing but a no-good addict, who was capable only of getting everyone's hopes up through stints of recovery, only to wind up worse than ever.\n\nMy low self esteem (stage 1), which had evolved into negative self-image (stage 2) had become an incredible and aggressive self-loathing. Quieting the mind with drugs was completely impossible. I started to feel genuine rage: towards God, myself, and everyone around me. I started to understand the darkest elements of human nature.\n\nLoneliness, sensation seeking, boredom, - none of these problems could even be conceived as separate any longer. My problem was that I was alive, and had to continue to experience the hell of end-stage hardcore drug addiction, which had become my only reality. Hope had become the illusion; sobriety could never be achieved. I started to doubt that even death could save me; I would go from one hell to another.\n\nThe only thing that kept me alive at the end was the knowledge that if I killed myself with this injection, then I wouldn't be able to get that infamous \"one more\", no matter how unsatisfying it always was. My last two weeks of hardcore addiction consisted of using solely to obliterate consciousness. I could not stand to be awake.\n\nEnd stage addiction was like being ensnared in a vast and intricate spider web of problems. Everywhere I turned I saw problems that were linked in a million unsolvable ways.\n\nThe solutions that were immediately apparent were to numb myself to the web of problems with the most potent drugs known to man, which doesn't even work at the end stage anyway, or obliterate myself and the web, which I was very close to doing.\n\nLuckily, my family came to help me one last time. Apparently I reached out to them during a blackout. I could not have escaped the web by myself.\n\nAll of life had become one problem, which meant there was only one solution: transformation. I think this is why spirituality is the most successful treatment for addiction. It leads to transformation. \n\nTransformation is akin to a process of controlled and subtle self-immolation that extends outward into the web of problems that surrounds me. The web becomes weaker; I am able to navigate it with more control.\n\nThat was my experience, anyway, and transformation is a topic that deserves its' own post.\n\nWhat do you guys think about this list? Anything I missed?",

Important note: she is not using and I am 100% positive of that. \n\nThe main reason I‚Äôm posting this is cause I‚Äôm curious if any recovering addicts have ever had a similar urge to do this. I personally love sleep and am an early riser. She is a night owl, but over the years it has gotten worse and worse. Nowadays I wake up at 4-5am to start my work day and she‚Äôs still awake and doom scrolling or nodding in the bathroom and getting to bed around 5-6am. I have to wake her up at 7am usually for reasons I won‚Äôt get into, but you can likely guess and then she‚Äôll usually go back to ‚Äúsleep-ish‚Äù (sleeping at the table, in the bathroom, etc) or sometimes will go to bed and then I wake her up again at 2-3pm.\n\nAny input on a shared experience is appreciated, but please note: she is not using and that is something I am 100% sure of. My thoughts have been that this is some type of mental health issue. She speaks with therapists and psychiatrists but they have no valuable solution or input.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone-\n\nSo i've been using fetanyl daily for about 7 years. I did get clean and go on Suboxone for a few months about 4 years ago, but other than that, I haven't gone more than one day without using since like 2018. I use nasally, I've never used a needle or used any other way, other than sniffing it. I was pretty fortunate that I had pretty much the best plug around this area and always had pretty high-quality dope. That's not just my opinion, I know several customers who would all tell you the same thing. No other dealer compared to his stuff. They were only a few times in the past seven years where I had to use someone else's product for one reason or another, and it was just no comparison. But many of his customers would all say the same thing, nobody else had a product anywhere as close to how good and strong his dope was. But these same people will also tell you that his dope is the hardest to come off of. The withdrawal from his stuff are the worst, like 10 times worse than anyone else's product. I did use about 2.5 g a day pretty much every day for the past seven years. I've been wanting to get a clean lately, but you know how it is, just so hard. However, last week he got raided and his whole operation is done. I don't think he's ever getting out of jail. I honestly saw this as a sign from God to finally get clean. I've tried a couple other people's stuff since then, but there is really no comparison at all. for the past week, I've been doing about 1.5 g every other day. Basically just enough to keep from getting really sick. However, i'm not feeling too great and I'm having really bad stomach issues. Is it possible I'm going through withdrawals even though I'm still using because it's such a lower quality than I'm used to? I know a couple people who got clean by switching from his staff to someone else's which was lower quality, and then go cold turkey from that. They all said it made it so much easier to go cold turkey that way instead of just go in cold turkey from the higher quality stuff. I honestly didn't put 2 and 2 together until right now that the reason I'm having such bad stomach issues is because I'm withdrawing, even though I'm still using very close to the same amount that I'm used to. i'm sorry this post is so long and I'm just rambling at this point. What does this sound possible to anyone? Could I be going through with Charles even though I'm still using, because the quality is so different than what I'm used to? I desperately want to get clean and I'm hoping that I gradually reducing my intake the past few days with this lower strength Dope, it will make it easier for me to completely stop ASAP. Does anyone have any input on this? I'm so done with this drug taking over my life. I just want to get off of it completely and get my life back. Thank you for reading. I know this is a really long post. Any input is really appreciated.",

I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôm gonna kill myself with so much paracetamol. \n\nI want to change and the only way I can think is by making it permanently know to my medical team and local pharmacies. I‚Äôm scared because it‚Äôs so definite and what if I need pain relief in the future and I can‚Äôt access it (I can‚Äôt do NSAIDs due to a stomach surgery) but I‚Äôm starting to feel like maybe the potential future pain is worth it. I can‚Äôt live like this anymore. I hate how it makes me behave, I‚Äôm like Jekyll and Hyde, funny outgoing and kind, dedicated and focused when high and a short tempered uncaring twat when I‚Äôm sober. Before this spiral I‚Äôd really got my mental health sorted and was eating right, exercising and just so happy and hopeful for the future. I want that back. I‚Äôm ruining my marriage by being so distant because all I can‚Äôt think about is drugs. I‚Äôm wishing time alone to get high, but then get high and just feel overwhelming empty and anxious because I know what I‚Äôm doing is harming my life. I miss my wife and how close we felt, but I‚Äôve created such a distance these last few years that she barely knows me anymore. \n\nI‚Äôm terrified. How do you guys stay strong in talking to your doctors and actual being honest? I‚Äôm so scared about being made to feel like a shit person or like judgement. I‚Äôm going to ask to speak to this specific doctor I once had who made me feel very comfortable. I just hope I don‚Äôt bottle it. ",

    "title": "My Journey out of addiction with SR17018 a new RC",
    "selftext": "I want to share my story‚Äîone of transformation, hope, and salvation. After 20 years trapped in the grip of synthetic opioids, some up to 200 times more potent than morphine, I finally found a way out. This is thanks to SR-17018, a research chemical that could change everything for those struggling with addiction.\n\nWhat is SR-17018 and Why is It Revolutionary?\n\nSR-17018 is a Research Chemical, currently synthesized by only one laboratory in Asia. After months of obsessive research, desperate searching, and sheer determination, I managed to find it. Unlike traditional opioids or treatments like methadone and Suboxone, SR-17018 works in an entirely different and groundbreaking way.\n\nIt‚Äôs a G-protein-biased agonist targeting the mu-opioid receptor (MOR). In simple terms, this means it activates the MOR selectively, avoiding the pathways (like Œ≤-arrestin2 signaling) responsible for the dangerous side effects of conventional opioids, such as respiratory depression, rapid tolerance, and intense dependence.\n\nThe most remarkable feature of SR-17018 is its complete suppression of cravings. Not reduction‚Äîelimination. For those who‚Äôve lived through the torment of opioid cravings, this is nothing short of miraculous.\n\nMy Experience: From Addiction to Freedom\n\nWhen I started SR-17018, I was terrified. My history included numerous failed attempts at detox, rehab stays, and even a 15-day coma that nearly ended my life. I was using synthetic opioids in massive doses, with a tolerance that seemed impossible to overcome.\n\nBut SR-17018 completely rewrote my story:\n\nNo cravings. From the very first dose, I experienced zero desire to return to opioids. For the first time in 20 years, I felt free from the mental chains of addiction.\n\nNo severe withdrawal symptoms. The usual agony of withdrawal‚Äîpain, insomnia, anxiety‚Äînever came. I only felt mild flu-like symptoms and occasional dizziness, which were easily manageable.\n\nRediscovering life. After years of living in a fog, I began to feel my body and emotions again. The sensation of cold air, the feeling of my teeth in my mouth‚Äîthese were small, yet profound reminders of what it means to be alive.\n\n\nIn just two weeks, I transitioned from extremely high doses of synthetic opioids to zero, without suffering or relapse. It felt like a miracle.\n\nWhy SR-17018 is a Game-Changer\n\nSR-17018 is not perfect‚Äîit‚Äôs still experimental, and access is extremely limited. But what it offers is real hope. In a world ravaged by the opioid epidemic, this compound has the potential to revolutionize treatment.\n\nTraditional methods like methadone and Suboxone are helpful, but they come with significant drawbacks: cravings, dependency, and the risk of relapse. SR-17018 is different. By completely eliminating cravings and drastically reducing withdrawal symptoms, it provides a pathway to recovery that is almost unimaginable.\n\nA Message of Hope\n\nTo anyone reading this and struggling with addiction: don‚Äôt lose hope. There are solutions out there, and SR-17018 is proof of that. I‚Äôm living evidence that even the most severe addiction can be overcome.\n\nThis compound isn‚Äôt just another treatment‚Äîit‚Äôs a revolution. With its unique mechanism and safety profile, SR-17018 could change the way we think about opioid recovery forever.\n\nI encourage you to educate yourself, discuss options with medical professionals, and never stop searching for solutions. SR-17018 saved my life, and I believe it can save many others.\n\nYou are not alone. There is a way out, even when everything feels lost. Keep fighting.\n\nPS: Don't seek direct medical advice !!!!

    "selftext": "Please help me out with some perspective. I know this is the concequence of my actions, but I'm still so incredibly pissed and I feel like my friend is being incredibly shitty. How would you frame this situation?\n\nMy friend opened his home to me at the beginning of October because my landlord needed my place to house relatives and I couldn't find a place that would allow my two cats within an hour of my work and social life by the time I needed to move out. He saved my ass, and it was also in his interest because his partner recently moved in with another dude (coercive poly situation) and he didn't want to be depressed and alone all winter. \n\nI was actively using opiates when I moved in. I relapsed in late 2022 after my partner died suddenly in my arms. It's fucked, but I can truthfully say opiates kept me alive dozens of times over and at the end of the day I don't regret picking up two years ago. Anyway, I tried cleaning up so many damn times at home by myself with the Bernese method throughout 2023, and especially before moving here. My friend doesn‚Äôt use and didn't know I did. I failed getting clean at home, so I enacted my backup plan, which was using two weeks' vacation at the end of November over Thanksgiving to go to detox (since I would finally have someone to look after my cats!). I've been home on suboxone for two weeks now, and I'll be hopping to subutex soon to wean off of MAT.\n\nI won't bog you down with the details, but I don't consider this friend as an emotionally safe confidant due to the way he treated me over the summer. I didn't tell him I had a problem, and I thought I didn't owe him that information since I hid it well enough that it didn't become apparent or affect him at all. When he asked where I was going in November I just told him it was personal. He said it was fine. \n\nYesterday we were having a normal conversation and he asked me \"so, how was detox?\" I answered. He asked about follow up treatment and what my plan was, and I told him everything. Then he explained that he's watched friends die from opiates before (like so many in our generation), asked me a bunch of shitty questions that implied that he thinks I'm a liar and doesn't believe that I'm actually clean, and then he said I can't live here anymore. Apparently he figured out I was using soon after I moved in, it stressed him out thinking I might die on him, and he doesn't want to be around if I relapse. After apologizing and explaining why I didn't tell him, I asked why he doesn't just ask me to prove I'm clean instead of kicking  me out. He said he doesn't want to \"save\" me, which seemed like such a shitty nonsequitur. I asked why he didn't bring this up before it if it affected him so much, and he said he was \"afraid of what [I] might do\" as in kill myself or something. He also told me he knows I'm in a dark place and hopes I can think of him as someone to confide in, since I \"can't get better alone.\" The audacity. \n\nHe wants me out by January 1, which will probably be impossible. He knows I'll be out of town all next week for work, and the other week is Christmas. \n\nI feel like I didn't owe him any information unless he asked. I didn't trust him with my big secret thing that only a few close friends back home were aware of, in part due to his actions over the summer. I feel resentful af that he's using the fact that I wasn't  forthcoming to imply that I'm a shitty liar all around. Especially since I demonstrated my willingness to answer all direct questions he had on the topic, and our friendship doesn't include trust issues due to lies on either side. I'm so incredibly resentful of how he knows he's putting me into an impossible situation with the extreme lack of available housing and time, and he's unwilling to give me a single chance to show him that I'm serious about my recovery before kicking me out on my ass. I'm feeling like pulling the plug on the friendship altogether. \n",

    "selftext": "Before I start, none of this is medical advice, it's just an account of my own experience with quitting tramadol and what helped me and how I felt etc. \n\nSo to begin. I was taking tramadol for chronic pain but even taking less than the prescribed dose daily is enough to make you dependent on tram. I've been off it now for a week and the withdrawals haven't been awful, the long taper has defo helped. Mainly feel like I have a cold and lots of violent sneezing, but there have been some darker moments where the depression really hits and I get a sense of impending doom. I find it really helps to go hour by hour so you just think to yourself \"let's just get through this next hour\" and before you know it, it's the next day and you feel fine again.\n\nI only decided to come off of tram for the sake of my long term health and I'm now exploring other avenues to deal with my chronic pain (pilates is one example) \n\nI did a very long taper with absolutely 0 plan and for some this may not work at all. I'm a pretty chaotic person so this worked great for me lol. I did it without any help or advice from a doctor which may not be the ideal route if you're quitting a higher dose. I just didn't want to be put on anything else and I like to do things my own way lol. \n\nI was taking 200mg a day (2x50mg morning and night), some days I'd take an extra 50mg if my pain was really bad. If I missed a dose or went somewhere and forgot my pills, the anxiety about the withdrawals was crippling and was almost as bad if not worse to the point I felt nauseous at times. \n\nI realised recently that this is an awful way to live and that I had to do something about it but I knew there was no chance I was going to come off of it cold turkey. I have a little stash of different cbd products and over the years when I've gone into initial withdrawals (say 12hrs after last dose), occasionally I would take a little cbd and within 20 mins I would feel a lot better but it would only usually last 2 hours or so. You can pretty much take as much cbd as you like though as far as I'm aware (do your own research) only problem is that it's pretty expensive. \n\nSo one day I decided I would just half my dose (50mg morning and night), , that caused some minor withdrawals but not too bad as there's still some in your system to take the edge off. \n\nI stuck at this for a good few weeks until one morning I think I forgot to take it or something before work and just thought \"f**k it, I'll try and get through the day and see how it goes\" that was probably the toughest day as it was the first 24 hours without any tramadol so the withdrawals really hit me during the day, I just did everything I could to keep busy and at one point I actually called my mum to bring me some but she couldn't make it to my work so I just had to deal with it. This is where the \"one hour at a time\" mentality really helped and I got through the day. I was very anxious for the whole day and struggled to focus really. \n\nI think after this, I went back to 100mg a day again and my plan was just to listen to my body. I eventually got to a point where 100mg felt fine so I decided I would miss the morning dose and take the night dose and keep that up for a few weeks until that began to feel normal too. (The reason for taking the night dose instead of the morning was that I preferred to get through the day awake without it than try to sleep without it/wake up in withdrawal as I felt awful when I'd wake up after missing a dose.) I was essentially trying to stretch out the amount of time that a single pill 'took the edge off'. I'm not sure how the hell this worked but I guess it's something to do with getting less serotonin from the drug than you're used to so your brain/body or w/e begins making more of its own again. This probably only worked because of the prolonged taper, Idk I'm not a scientist haha but I managed to get past 24 hours of feeling normal just off one pill whereas in the beginning, 2 pills wasn't enough to get me past 12 hours. I eventually ended up falling asleep at night and missing the dose and I woke up in the middle of the night, firstly there was an initial panic then I realised I felt okay and this was the day I decided to quit for good. Idk why I hadn't been taking the cbd all along, I kinda forgot I had it but I remembered it in this moment and how it helped so I took some cbd and went back to sleep and for the last week I've been taking the cbd consistently, morning and night (and sometimes throughout the day too if it's a bad day). The cbd has helped MASSIVELY. One of the worst things about the withdrawals for me is the RLS, especially at night or if you're just sat watching TV for example. I'd find myself kicking my legs and just feel so uncomfortable in my own skin - a few drops of cbd and 20 mins or so later and I felt fine again. \n\nI'm not sure how well CBD would work if you're going cold turkey or withdrawing from larger amounts of tram but might be worth a try. Even if it just helps you get through the next hour or 2. Do your own research and find a reputable seller. Again, not medical advice, just sharing what helped for me. \n\nSorry if this is a bit long and a chaotic read, if you have any questions just drop em in the comments or DM me :) \n\nTLDR: Tapered off tramadol for weeks with no real plan for the sake of my own long term health. Was taking for chronic pain, never exceeded prescribed dose, withdrawals sucked the first 24 hours without tram. Tapering allowed me to \"stretch out\" how long the tram took the edge off until I finally fell asleep without taking my dose when I got down to 1 a day. Woke up and realised I didn't feel as bad as I expected to so decided to quit there and then. When I finally quit and remembered how much cbd helped, I took that and it helped massively with getting through the withdrawal symptoms, especially RLS, and depression/anxiety. Have taken the CBD consistently, morning and night (and sometimes throughout the day) for the last week or so. Every day gets easier. ",

    "selftext": "I'm on day 12, no tramadol.  Day 6, no kratom. Did a fast taper then went cold turkey on the tram, then used very little kratom (15 gram or less per day) and then no more of that since 6 days ago.  Was never a big kratom user.  I got some legitimate help and have 100 mg gaba to take 3 times a day.   How do I feel?  Not terrible, but certainly not good.  If I can sleep, I feel great in the morning and then that dwindles at about 3 pm.  Evening and night times are the worst with rising anxiety and some restless legs.  It's almost like a sundown phenomenon.  I hope I'll be sleeping tonight.  Slept pretty good last night.  Anyway, if you have some positive thoughts or stories, I'd sure like to read them later as I'll probably wake up in the wee hours.  Please no negative or scary stuff, this is bad enough as it is.  I'm in my 60's, female.  How I got here is moot.  I'll say it's been nightmarish trying to find help that I was willing to accept - was not interested in suboxone taper or buprenorphine. ER and Primary Care MD were of little use and no use respectively.  Have some recommendations to pursue including a psychiatric nurse practitioner and therapists that my medicare and supplemental insurance might cover.  However, I've still got to live this day by day and sure hoping things continue to improve.  I think I'm making progress.... but it's pretty slow.\n\n",

    "selftext": "So I stopped taking codeine around 4 days ago, I‚Äôd been taking it everyday for a year, only in small doses though and only in the evening. Never felt addicted or cravings for it, just thought it helped me with pain I always have. \n\nObviously underestimated it. Over 2 days ago I started having a massive panic attack, I thought it was due to asthma which I also have. Went hospital several times and they couldn‚Äôt find what was wrong with me, the panic attacks wouldn‚Äôt relent and I felt like I was dying. So kept going back. Eventually I realised I‚Äôd stopped taking codeine and it was probably the cause. Lots of my symptoms matched. \n\n I‚Äôm in hospital now and all my tests showed in very healthy so it‚Äôs definitely withdrawal. I‚Äôve been having constant panic attacks for nearly 3 days. Hard to really explain how brutal that is. It‚Äôs certainly not as bad because the first 2 days were insanely awful for me but I still feel it and have waves of slight normality to heart palpitations that lead to panic even now, in hospital knowing I‚Äôm actually healthy.\n\nAnyway, the question is..my doctor gave me a few options and one was to go back on the codeine but at small doses and slowly ween myself off it. Honestly I really hope I don‚Äôt have to do that. Have I got through the hardest part already or will this last long term if I don‚Äôt ween myself off? I feel like the worst 2+ days of my life will be meaningless if I do it. At least it accomplished pushing through the worst agony. I know people can ween themselves and still get withdrawals at the end. Aren‚Äôt I just delaying the inevitable for the hope, next time it won‚Äôt be as bad because I did it slowly? I guess it‚Äôs been 4 days since I last took codeine and intense withdrawal effects have been for 2.5 days maybe. ",

    "title": "My ex used my addiction/recovery against me ",
    "selftext": "\n\nThis summer, I met a girl when I wasn‚Äôt looking to date. Things escalated quickly‚Äîwe kissed and started spending all our time together. The first month felt like a dream. She was love-bombing me, and I fell for it, thinking we both trusted each other. She was smart, beautiful, and always critical of others‚Äîjudging their intelligence, lives, and choices. Despite those red flags, I was drawn to her.\n\nWe even bought one-way tickets to Istanbul, planning a new chapter together. But just days before the flight, the Marshals evicted her from her apartment. I took her into my home, a big apartment I inherited from my parents, and didn‚Äôt ask her for rent despite her talking about having plenty of money. I didn‚Äôt care about money since I was financially stable.\n\nAfter moving in, she started changing. She demanded I stop calling her ‚Äúbaby,‚Äù something we used to do. I tried to respect her wishes but often slipped up. She stopped being affectionate, refused sex, and moved to the living room, leaving me in the bedroom. She would set boundaries for me but didn‚Äôt respect mine‚Äîshe‚Äôd kiss or touch me but made me feel bad if I did the same.\n\nI tried everything to make her happy, even compromising my own needs. I‚Äôm from Kosovo, raised Muslim, and family is my priority. We talked about having kids, and I was excited about our future. But then, on her birthday, she left in the middle of the night.\n\nAfter she left, I discovered she had been posting about me on Reddit while living in my home. Her posts were full of lies‚Äîshe claimed I was abusive, a narcissist, and even a criminal. She shared a humiliating video of me drunk, something a caring partner would never do. Instead of helping me, she used my vulnerability against me.\n\nShe twisted everything to make me look bad. For example, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù, and she was 6‚Äô2‚Äù. She claimed she needed shelter from domestic violence, even though she was the one who attacked me in my apartment. She poured olive oil everywhere, physically hit me, and even ran into the street, lying down to create a scene.\n\nShe falsely accused me of sending someone to harm her (I don‚Äôt even have a brother, just one sister) and said I trafficked her to my dealer for drugs. I‚Äôve been on Suboxone for years, and she knew about it from the start. She accused me of stealing money and claimed she was supporting us financially, even though I spent my disability check on food and beer for us.\n\nI later learned that she had been engaged to a man before we met and was secretly involved in sex work without telling me. I don‚Äôt judge anyone for their choices, but I believe partners should be honest about their past.\n\nShe manipulated everyone around her. She made posters mocking her ex, accusing her of having bedbugs, and posted them all over gay bars. She used a police officer friend to buy her food and drinks, even having him take her out while I stayed home. She took advantage of his feelings for her, just like she did with me.\n\nAfter everything, I feel like I lost three months of my life to a scam artist. She made me question my sanity, calling me a sociopath and a narcissist. At one point, I even believed her. But now I see her for who she truly is‚Äîa manipulative, dishonest person who uses others and then discards them.\n\nDespite everything, I never retaliated or exposed her online the way she did to me. I believe in karma and know that what you put into the world comes back to you. My dad always says, ‚ÄúWhatever you do, you do to yourself.‚Äù\n\nIf you‚Äôre ever in a relationship where someone disrespects or harms you, call the cops. Don‚Äôt ignore red flags or let someone convince you that you‚Äôre the problem. I‚Äôve learned my lesson, and I‚Äôm glad she‚Äôs gone. I just hope I never see her again.\n\nPIQKA \n\n",

Mega dosing C is by far the most helpful + Gabapentin and Clonidine at night for sleep and RLS.  Mandatory exercise.  I‚Äôve used small doses of Kratom at times which makes it even more manageable but I hate the taste and effects on stomach.  \n\nThe bad: there‚Äôs something about day 4 when it comes to my mental state.

This doesn‚Äôt apply to novice addicts with less than three years of usage‚ÄîI‚Äôm speaking for the hardcore users with 8 to 15+ years of daily fentanyl use or extremely high doses of oxycodone (300mg+ daily).\n\nThat‚Äôs why they say you only get clean when you hit rock bottom. At rock bottom, you‚Äôre at your lowest, but you also have the time and opportunity to focus on recovery. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs impossible to withdraw in a shorter period‚Äîthere are certainly some strong-willed individuals who have managed to do so. However, most addicts need around 45 days to feel stable enough to work and start living a life free from chasing substances.\n\nWhat I‚Äôm trying to say is this: if you‚Äôre an addict with a serious addiction, you may need to sacrifice your job to prioritize getting clean. Obviously, this means planning your resignation‚Äînot just quitting impulsively. You need to save up funds and prepare yourself for the process.\n\nAnd let‚Äôs not forget that many addicts don‚Äôt have insurance to cover rehab.

    "selftext": "In November 2016, we hired someone to mow the lawn. On their way passed the white picked fence gate, they bumped one side so the lock wouldn't line up. I pushed down with my right arm and pulled the other side up with my left arm, I heard a \"POP\" and I was on the ground. I crawled to my house about 20 feet away painfully, as soon as I got my head in the door, I couldn't move so my legs were still outside for 3 hours. I then scampered to my bed another 10 feet away and stayed there for 2 days.\n\nI went to an Ortho about 2 weeks later, it was still bothering me. He sends me for MRI. He holds off on the MRI results to tell me to get a CT scan bc \"the radiologist saw something on your MRI that he wants you to check out, it's probably nothing but you should have it checked out\". I didn't do it, I come back 9 months later with severe pains in my legs, he refuses to see me until I get CT scan which I do that day. It shows fibrous dysplasia, nonaggressive. Then he refuses to treat me at all.\n\nI go for another year or two before it gets so painful I can't take it. Original MRI showed mild to moderate spinal stenosis, L4-L5 disc torn, foraminal encroachment.\n\nI go to like 10 orthos bc I know I'm in severe pain and you don't go from no pain to severe pain overnight without something seriously wrong. They say they have no surgical option, basically think I'm \"drug seeking\".\n\nI white knuckled it for 2 years but I couldn't take it anymore, the pain was just enormous, I couldn't sleep, I couldn't lie down without my legs going, it was just the worst pain imaginable. So I start using oxy which unknowingly becomes fent and get stuck doing so for 5 years. In those 5 years I got several MRIs, but they were all Stand Up MRIs where you sit up. They weren't showing all the damage. I get a real MRI 3 months ago and it shows:\n\nModerate spinal stenosis starting at L2-L3 and at it's worst at L5-S1, all the way throughout. Along with arthritis all the way throughout my lumbar region. I'm 39 years old.\n\nL2-L3 = disc bulging, arthritis\n\nL3-L4 = disc torn, foraminal encroachment, (pinched nerves), arthritis\n\nL4-L5 = disc torn, bilateral foraminal encroachment, moderate stenosis, arthritis\n\nL5-S1 = disc bulge, bilateral foraminal encroachment, worst stenosis, arthritis\n\nI quit the fent 2 weeks ago, the pain was so severe I could not walk right. My pain was completely being covered up by the fent and without any pain meds, I just don't move well at all. I have several appointments upcoming, two with spinal surgeons, one with pain mgmt, one with my primary. Thats my story.\n\nI got off fent by using methadone taper for 4 days and then oxy for 1.5 weeks and then suboxone. Had to make sure all fent and methadone were clear.",

    "title": "I‚Äôm in a relationship with an addict who‚Äôs relapsed I don‚Äôt know what to do to help them ",
    "selftext": "TLDR AT BOTTOM . This just includes a lot of maybe helpful details to get a big picture. \nSo I‚Äôve been with this person for the last 14 years. They are the father to my 3 year old son. We used to use together, before I got clean over 7 years ago. He was full blown addicted to fentanyl 2 years ago, weighing 115 pounds when he finally got arrested and forced to get clean and released July of 2023. He almost died. Many times, but that jail saved his life literally, as he was in ICU at hospital away from jail shortly after an arrest with heart ejection fraction of a mere 12 percent. If was arrested not even two days later he would‚Äôve been dead. For sure if not from an OD, his heart was about to give out. He used opiates since 2009. Every single day, but jail time, until that arrest. He lasted maybe a day or two before he demanded he see doctor for benzos for anxiety. Something he‚Äôs never been addicted to. I highly suggested against it as it‚Äôs recommended short term and he‚Äôs not mentally ready for anything short term. He did it anyway. He agreed to finally take  Suboxone and not worry about being addicted to suboxone though. So he did stay on that. But he‚Äôs on both. He relapsed not too long after release but didn‚Äôt do it again for awhile and has one more relapse and was done with opiate relapse for a long time, maybe 8 months. However he did begin drinking daily. And I fought very hard for him to stop and begged him. Nobody even the counselor said if he‚Äôs doing so well and avoiding fentanyl to not worry about this too much. I eventually gave it up. He gained so much weight he looked like the man I always knew he could be‚Ä¶Despite taking his benzos and having drinks everyday still seemed to be doing well. Those were never his DOC. Well fast forward to the end of the first 8 months‚Ä¶ he began showing signs I feared of alcoholism. He couldn‚Äôt take a break despite promising. Eventually he relapsed on pills ‚Ä¶. Snorted them. Avoided shooting‚Ä¶ relapse would happen, a month would go by. I thought he had a chance since it was just one time but I knew it was bad risk. I began showing him how I was right about how he should‚Äôve not gotten into benzos, alcohol‚Ä¶. But he wouldn‚Äôt stop. He will stop his sub treatment and relapse up to 2-3 a month by now for the next two months. Then by the 10th month of probation it was atleast 3 relapses a month. By July of this year he‚Äôs relapsing atleast 3 times a month still until September when it‚Äôs once a week. I‚Äôm extremely desperate he promises every time and I want to tell his PO before it‚Äôs out of hand to test him once a week not once a predictable time a month but he begs me and says two years of suspended sentence in prison is terrible for us. I said ‚Äúit‚Äôs only 2 years for the rest of our life I can‚Äôt keep accepting promises and you knowing the consequences and then you doing it again over and over!! ‚Äú I just wanted more supervision so he went back to how the first 8 months were. I thought I was finally maybe getting the man I‚Äôve been waiting to see all these years. Things came out that were wonderful that were hidden under addiction and now it‚Äôs quickly coming back. Well the last two months‚Ä¶ has progressed as I worried into today. He has officially stopped his sub treatment for 3 days straight about 10 days ago, and successfully got his first physical withdrawal symptom. I completely knew it was hopeless on him doing it on his own now. He‚Äôs never done it before. He promised he would get through the sickness. Surprise he didn‚Äôt. And I mean he would go as far as having a 2 hour conversation convincing me to please give one last chance it‚Äôs the last chance and later on that day or the next sneak off and get more and worry about consequences and apologies later. I warned him that using while now physically, not just mentally hooked, is the worst thing he can do for his addiction and prolonging the inevitable and it‚Äôll be the same if not worse later. He convinced himself that if he took a sub while on it it‚Äôll just avoid the sickness and he will be fine. I tried for two hours explaining to him how that is impossible there will have to be a day of discomfort to get back on subs now. Well every single day he‚Äôs relapsed. I went as far as finding his connection and calling them and threatening them not to sell to him. They complied‚Ä¶. But now‚Ä¶. His next connection I didn‚Äôt know about was fentanyl. His grand plan of course didn‚Äôt work. I was right, and he got sick again. He told me he‚Äôd get through the sickness so today he went all day . He took a sub and felt worse but I promised him if he keeps taking by later it‚Äôll be over he‚Äôll be back on subs. He made it until 10pm‚Ä¶ he even said he felt better. And then randomly someone comes to my neighborhood at 10pm to deliver him needles and fentanyl, and he shot up for the first time since before jail. Game over. Now what??? He‚Äôs begging me not to tell his PO, but he also has said he‚Äôs not allowed to go to rehab or he will go to jail. I KNOW he is full blown addicted again. He‚Äôs already lost 10 pounds in two weeks. He was 186 pounds from 115 when he was arrested. Now he‚Äôs back down 176 and doing the same shit again. I found it and a threw it down the toilet and took his pack of needles and broke completely and trashed them but I don‚Äôt know what to do. As an ex addict I know his promises tonight of not doing it again are lies. He just said this every single day and saying it with complete sincerity for hours on end. He said why can‚Äôt you just kick me out instead of throwing me in jail? Why??? Because his son began to love him for the first time this last year, I thought we could finally have a chance to move on‚Ä¶ if he worked on stopping drinking and weaned off the doctors benzos. But now this too??? He‚Äôs telling me I‚Äôm cold blooded if I put him in jail to detox off his meds. He still says he‚Äôs not full blown addicted to opiates again but he clearly is. Nobody uses a week straight with now physical withdrawal symptoms and not be full blown addicted. I don‚Äôt want to kick him out because I know he will die out there with free run to use. I will feel forever guilt I didn‚Äôt have him locked up then. And he says he can‚Äôt do inpatient or same result. He says IOP will work? How??? I can‚Äôt live every single day going to work now Monday since our break is over‚Ä¶ and knowing he‚Äôs behind my back feeding it every day making it worse and worse. I‚Äôm telling him every time he uses while sick it‚Äôs making the sickness later worse and worse. I was right and he even bet me $100 he was right. Course I don‚Äôt take his money,  but I told him this all!! And he won‚Äôt listen!! And on top, did it AGAIN, after seeing I Was RIGHT! He indeed got sicker on Sunday. I even predicted Sunday! And now he will be even sicker Monday and Tuesday even worse, and he or I will be away at work. This dealer of his for fentanyl delivers to him no matter what. This guy desperately wants him hooked in a bad way. I succeeded in ruining his pill connection (which was laced anyway by the end) but now he has this. And it‚Äôs strong enough for him to OD. He didn‚Äôt because he took 2 subs today. He even started to feel better. How stupid can he be? He‚Äôs been through this and I thought rock bottom!?? He feared ever being addicted again and was happy not needing opiates. He knew the risks. wtf. I knew this would happen tho with the alcohol and benzos. Eventually. Any trigger would set him off and it sure did. \n\nTLDR :\nI‚Äôm at a loss what to do. Partner and beloved father of my 3 year old son , got clean off fentanyl after jail stint in July 2023, and had a relapses starting 8 months in, closer and closer together on snorting pills, until it went back to shooting fentanyl for the first time since tonight. He‚Äôs had sick withdrawal symptoms for 5 days now. But can‚Äôt seem to keep promise, as I know he can‚Äôt handle sick on his own ever. (Even though I did myself over 7 years ago and way sicker than how he is currently‚Ä¶ but his sickness will get worse with every use but he won‚Äôt stop) do I call his PO and ask for him to go rehab before jail, or just have them test him and let it play out? He‚Äôs on probation with a suspended sentence of probably 2 years prison. Our child will be devastated. But if he continues he will either die or be back to how he was before, 115 pounds and dying, and devastate his son anyway. He‚Äôs up to 176 pounds today. And it‚Äôs not healthy or safe for him to be in house like this. Yes it happens away from house but never know now. Do I kick him out and let the streets possibly just kill him with zero support??? I‚Äôm at a loss. ",

    "selftext": "Hi, I just want to say something about what happened to me yesterday afternoon.\nSo I was a polysubstance drug addict for 17 years, up until yesterday I‚Äôd been clean for 16 months until I was going through my room and found an old shoebox in my wardrobe that was filled with needles old baggies some ghb and two oxycodone pills. I instantly felt sick after discovering the contents of the shoebox, but after the initial shock of finding it all the only thing I could think about was using and instead of coming clean with my loved one‚Äôs and getting rid of it all I went ahead and used. It was almost like I couldn‚Äôt control myself, once I had the pills and fresh needles in my hand it was like I became possessed, I instantly went to my desk and crushed the two 10mg oxycodone targin pills and injected them. The initial rush was amazing but soon after I realised that it was too strong and that I had fkd up I made it about two steps out of my room and collapsed. I think after about a minute my body started going into extremely harsh drug induced dystonia, intense myoclonic jerks, my breathing was shuttered almost like each time I tried to inhale I would have a hiccup reaction and I was going in and out of a delirium. While this was all happening I came to the realisation that I was going to die.. but the only thing I could think about was my family and how I didn‚Äôt want to lose them or vice versa. After fighting off death for the next I‚Äôm not sure how long I managed to remember that my phone was on my kitchen bench and I somehow mustered up all the strength I had left and crawled to my phone to call emergency services. I spent time in the hospital and was just discharged some time ago. I guess I am writing all of this for others who are thinking of using again to say to them that life is way too beautiful to let go of. Please know that there is help out there and that you are loved and cherished..! \nStay safe out there people you are worth it..! \n‚ù§Ô∏èüôèü¶æ",

    "selftext": "Avid h/fent User for 8 years with iv use for 6-7 years. over 2 months ago i started a fent taper with the last of the normal fent i had stashed up. 3-4 grams. Over 2 months I tapered down to literally salt sized grains. When that finally ran out i only had rinse/cottons left. Then i used those cottons for 3-5 and when those were gone i finally made the jump to roxies and percocet. I havent IVed anything for 16 days now!! Day 1 of no IV i was at 100mg of OXY to feel normal. I slowly worked down to 60mg Nd i am now at 40 mg a day to feel ok. I still do cheat with the roxies by snorting them. I do get a nice feeling from them but its nothing psychologically like h/fent. Im slowly lowering my dose and my method of ingestion. Im starting to transition to oral Percocet. Soon i will jump to strictly oral Percocet then to oral hydrocodone aka norco and attempt to walk that down. The other day i was out of oxy and needed 7 norco to feel normal throughout the day. So i need to get lower first since that acetaminophen is rough on us. One thing that has really helped is me meeting a new girlfriend who hasn't judged me and has supported me 100% , the new routine and normalness of her life is reallly really helping me. im somewhat successful. About 240k a year drive a 2024 corvette own a boat etc but When i was single i just got high and worked on running my business 24/7 and didnt realize how unhealthy it was and didnt realize how much a change would help me.  i just wanted to tell yall my current story and remind people that if theres a will theres a way. I was no quitter i was living this junkie shit but the new shitty supply of knockoff fent that doesnt even feel like dope forced me to give this up and im so thankful and ready. Im so excited to see how this pans out and what life has in store for me. Ive robbed myself of so much time and potential im just ready to finish this chapter and live the life i deserve. If youre reading this i promise you can walk this down too. Its possible !! If anyone wants tips or wants to talk just message me!!! Wish me luck on the rest of my journey \n\nThanks ",

I‚Äôm feeling torn between staying and helping him get through whatever this addiction is but the other part of me is feeling like I‚Äôll end up lied to, manipulated ( he‚Äôs done this before to me when my gut was telling me something is off and he‚Äôll gas lit me into believing I‚Äôm overthinking) and wasting a bunch of years before I see he‚Äôs going to pick his addiction over me. \n\nHe has his own company, he‚Äôs very high functioning, takes care of the bills, has a social life, etc. I‚Äôm saying this because he‚Äôs not relying on me for shit, or using me. he wants to be with me for me but how do I get over this betrayal. \n\nMid June to now I thought he was clean when I first caught him. He even started coming home early. I just can‚Äôt believe he‚Äôs smoking smack on a foil paper, popping pills and manipulating me this bad. I could never imagine a life without him but I‚Äôm scared that‚Äôs the real reality of my life and I need to somehow pick myself up and leave. Any advice would be appreciated please. I‚Äôm young and don‚Äôt have much experience with drug users or being betrayed. \n\n\nUpdate: ( I think this is where I do the update?) \nIt‚Äôs been really long two days. I‚Äôm mentally and emotionally exhausted. I read through all the messages and have to say thank you üôè. You guys don‚Äôt realize I come from a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù background with no drug issues so this insight you guys gave me has been very very helpful. Here‚Äôs the plan now \n\n1. He opened up to me and told me he needs help and can‚Äôt do it himself. It‚Äôs not mdma‚Äôs he‚Äôs addicted to. It‚Äôs fentanyl. He started about 7 years ago on and off and was only sober for the first 8 months of our relationship (together for 4.5 years now). He thought the street blue pills were opioids when it all started but it ended up having fentanyl and now he‚Äôs hooked. \n\n2. The drug tests were to fool me and earn my trust back. The person who commented on fentanyl strips being the only ones that can test it was right on the bulls eye. He would test positive sometimes because with his fentanyl pills they had ‚Äúfillers‚Äù or ‚Äúthey‚Äôre cut with those‚Äù (his words). He showed me his hiding spots, his dealers numbers, all the things he did to get the drugs. \n\n3. He‚Äôs now on day two of Suboxone. This threw him into precipitated withdrawals. It‚Äôs bad, he‚Äôs been sweating and shaking and took the biggest most disgustingly smelliest shit ever ( sorry tmi). Apparently people don‚Äôt poop when they‚Äôre addicted? \nHe‚Äôs asked me to look into MAT clinics and wants to get on suboxone for two weeks and then Vivitrol. \n\n4. I see what he‚Äôs going through and want to stick by his side. He was selfish in my opinion to lie to me and trick me. It hurts it‚Äôs always going to hurt. But if he‚Äôs willing to put himself through this much pain with the withdrawals I‚Äôm gonna stay and help him. He‚Äôs the man I married and to the commenter who said I married him for a reason is right. I have to stick by and give him another chance. \n\n5. I‚Äôm looking for al anon / narcotic meetings for him and for myself. Anyone have good recommendations on how to get started? Or do we do therapy? \n\n6. When looking for a clinic what should I look for? What‚Äôre things that I should look for to make sure they care for him and he has the best shot to get out of this hell hole? \n\n",

I‚Äôm having trouble showering and brushing my teeth, and I don‚Äôt feel anything toward my dog, which is scary. The depression is so bad. They‚Äôre claiming you won‚Äôt have withdrawals which is bullshit. I don‚Äôt have the physical withdrawals of going cold turkey, but the emotional toll is absolute hell. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm explaining this correctly, but methadone and opiates occupy your endorphin receptors, and once you‚Äôre off, you are left with nothing to occupy them. I saw a lot of success stories and talked to some people who‚Äôve done it and were successful, so I thought it would work for me and I‚Äôd be better, but that‚Äôs not the case for me.  I‚Äôm still off methadone and other drugs. So my question is, if my goal is to get off Methadone with tapering and I successfully got off of it, wouldn‚Äôt I be back to square one with my endorphins?? It sounds like a catch-22.

    "selftext": "Just for some context- I‚Äôve used opiates of all sorts on and off for 10 years. Total.. 4-5 of those years I have been sober with relapses sprinkled in. \nSo I had a surgery in March and I got prescribed oxys of course and that lead to be getting back involved with shit off the street in June. I was buying real M 30s for 5 of the 6 months I was doing them‚Ä¶ along with mixing Xanax. Not good.. I know. \nAt my peak of last month (October), I was taking two 30mg oxys at a time, two times a day, with a few 1mg xans. My guy ran out so I had to switch to the ‚Äúdirty 30s‚Äù for a few weeks. Money got tight, and I knew I had to get clean before it got even worse. I have a 5 year old son and a wife so I gave myself no choice. \n\n\nSo‚Ä¶ on November 18 I did my last bit of a dirty 30 and was prepared for the suck. I had one 8mg subutex to help. The first 24 hours, not too bad. At 48 hours the anxiety, depression, RSL & all of the other lovely withdrawal symptoms started kicking in (minus vomiting & diarrhea for whatever reason), but not as bad as I have felt in the past as I was still able to sleep. \nAt the 48th hour I did a small crumb of the sub, then another and another throughout the day until I took a total of 4mg. \nThe next day I felt really foggy, anxious etc. but nothing like I expected. Later that evening I took 2mg, went to bed and actually slept. Wasn‚Äôt good sleep but I slept for 6-7 hours. The next day which was this past Saturday,the 23rd, I took 2mg in the morning and have had nothing related to opiates since. I have had a few drinks a night to help with the nerves \n\nMy symptoms since (past 5 days) have been blurry vision, aimlessness, weakness & fatigue, difficulty sleeping (more so than the first 5 days), depression, heavy anxiety. But still no where near as bad as what I have experienced in the past after getting clean. The anxiety and fatigue are the heaviest symptoms. \n\nI am confused on why this time isn‚Äôt as bad as I was expecting‚Ä¶. From experience. Any insight?\n\nFor more detail- a few wholistic things I did over the past 10 days to help with symptoms are- \nAs hard as it was because of the fatigue‚Ä¶I‚Äôve hit the gym a few times and did 30 minutes of cardio and spent 20minutes in the sauna afterwards in hopes to sweat out the toxins and speed up the process. I meditate in the morning for 10 minutes or so and do other breathing exercises. I do this to try and slow my brain down and also, when you‚Äôre focused on your breathing you are not fixated as much on how bad you feel. Also, meditation and breath work increase your dopamine. I also have taken several cold showers which absolutely suck because of the temperature sensitivity that come with withdrawing, but cold water exposure GREATLY increases your dopamine & serotonin. It sucks but if you can handle it, do the research on it and do it! \n\nI did get a small script of Xanax (14 count) yesterday (Nov 27th) from my doctor to help with the anxiety and buddy what a relief.  I only wanted some to get me through the first few weeks of this process. I am not advocating for Xanax I am only giving the full story. 1mg Xanax and my vision is no longer blurry, the brain fog and confusion are gone, obviously the anxiety is suppressed, depression is suppressed but I am sure they will be back with PAWS. \n\nSide note- the last two nights I have been profusely sweating while sleeping. Not fun but none of this is ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nMy plan next week is to get back in the gym, cardio and weight lifting. This has been my savior with previous relapses. Working out gives you huge increases of dopamine, seratonin and other ‚Äúfeel good‚Äù brain chemicals us addicts have depleted ourselves of. \n\nI‚Äôve managed to be okay to function (barely) throughout this whole process and I‚Äôm baffled. 6 months of hard use and all I had was one 8mg sub stretched over 3 days‚Ä¶ while my sleep hasn‚Äôt been good, I‚Äôve managed to sleep at least 5 hours a night. I‚Äôve managed to get work done (I work from home brokering boat sales and my wife and I own a Flower Shop which I work at as well when needed). I‚Äôm not sure wtf is going on as to why this has been much easier than in the past. I know I‚Äôve done things like hitting the gym, cold showers, and meditating in hopes to offset symptoms but I still feel like I‚Äôve dodged a bullet‚Ä¶. \n\nEither this is a sign from god to get my shit together once and for all? My plug and I ended on bad terms so I can‚Äôt ever hit him up again. That‚Äôs of course a great thing but maybe now that I know for a fact I dont have any access to opiates, that somehow helped my psyche? or I found a good recipe for mitigating the symptoms of opiate withdrawal? Im not a doctor‚Ä¶. I am just confused lol \n\nSorry for the book. My hopes for this post is \n1. To try and help anyone going through this in any way I can. Meditation, breath work, cold water exposure, sauna & working out definitely help A TON. Do all of them if you can!! \n2. Trying to make sense as to why this withdrawal has been so moderate comparatively speaking. \n\n\nGood luck everyone! I can tell you from multiple experiences.. it gets better ü´∂üèª",

    "selftext": "I'm new to Reddit but found that reading people's firsthand experiences has been helpful and inspired me to want to stop taking opiates.\nIve been taking oxycodone for the better part of 15 years. I honestly don't believe I've ever missed a day in that time. I was originally prescribed for severe pain. I was taking about 40mg oxycontin and about 20mg Percocet per day until about a year ago when my doc cut down my Rx. (I truly don't think I need it for pain anymore and haven't got some time but I lied in order to get it because I was afraid of the withdrawal) My gp left and I decided that it was time to finally quit , mostly because I was embarrassed to tell my new doc. \nI have slowly been tapering with my leftover prescriptions since then. I was taking 10mg oxycontin and 10mg Percocet per day for the last 4-5 months until about 3 weeks ago when I started taking 10mg oxycontin every other day for 2 weeks then I stopped taking it altogether. Ive been off those for about a week now and experiences little to no withdrawals. I have now started taking 1 5mg Percocet per day I. An effort to try and slowly taper until I'm not taking anything. (I am leaving on a vacation in about 9 days and don't want to bring narcotics, even with an RX) I've been doing the 5mg Percocet per day for 3 days. I'm unsure how to stop completely thought. Has anyone else stopped from a similar dose after so long? The Percocet does have a perforated line that looks like it can be cut. I could possibly lower to 2.5mg per day for a cpl days before completely stopping but I thought breaking them open was not good. \nI'm so proud I've stopped this much and now this is the last little hump to get over. \nI am very aware that my dose is low in comparison to some but I am extremely busy with work and I really don't want to feel super terrible although I am prepared to do whatever it takes.

    "title": "Need help, I‚Äôm tired of running out and having to be sick for weeks until the next refill. What comfort meds will I need?",
    "selftext": "As the title says. I‚Äôm on Oxycodone. \n\nI have always been on Hydrocodone, I‚Äôm one of those people who prefers it to Oxy. I can take 60mg of Hydro and feel pain free and great, while 140mg of Oxy does nothing at all. \n\nI was used as a lab rat by my oncologist, he had me on 200mg of Oxy Contin every day, plus 200mg of Oxycodone IR daily. That‚Äôs around 400mg DAILY. \n\nWhen she told me she couldn‚Äôt refill anymore but spoke to my regalar pain doctor that she‚Äôd take over, she said absolutely NOT. This is an insane amount and I don‚Äôt want to kill you. She put me on 15mg of Oxy every 4-6 hours. I was left to suffer alone. This was back in September. I‚Äôm still suffering from WD‚Äôs, I run out early of my 270 pills a month script because my body feels so sick, since it was used to such exorbitant amounts. \n\nHow can I go back to Hydro? I used to take 40mg and will be fine. I know my tolerance is wrecked. \n\nShould I write to patient advocacy at the cancer hospital? Because when I go, they put a note on my chart that I‚Äôm a drug seeker. How? They put me on those amounts and when I showed up in pain and sick, because they didn‚Äôt even taper me, I‚Äôm a drug seeker? I was in pain and coming off that daily habit they had me on. \n\n My current pain doctor is an angel, she cares about me and wants to do a slow taper off my 15mg Oxy every 4 hours to 10mg. She doesn‚Äôt know I run\nOut in 10 days because of obvious reasons.\n\nI want to go back to Hydrocodone but I know my tolerance is so high, crazy enough I have taken 70mg (CWE) and feel great. I can go to work and life is grand. But 140mg of Oxy? I feel gross, sick and tired. That‚Äôs why they say everyone‚Äôs body is different. I‚Äôm mostly upset at the cancer center they basically put me on these high amounts and called me a drug seeker.\n\nWell, the holidays are coming. There‚Äôs a huge Thanksgiving feast my family does and I only have 50mg of Oxy left. I‚Äôm not touching it until the day of, otherwise I won‚Äôt enjoy it and I‚Äôll be sick. Currently on:\n\nKlonopin 0.5mg three times a day (it helps a lot)\n\nTramadol (I stopped this med cold turkey like an idiot not knowing how gross it is. I took it because they sell them over the counter at the Mexican stores and figured it‚Äôll hold me off until my refill. Please stay away, I ended up in ER and admitted for 4 days because of WD‚Äôs, it‚Äôs an SSRI also so it‚Äôs hell on earth, I‚Äôm still having tremors and muscle pain)\n\nGabapentin 300mg three times a day \n\nOlanzapine 5mg before sleep \n\nMy next refill date is the 15th of December, so like 20 days from now? What will I do? I‚Äôm tired of this stupid game. \n\nMy cancer is doing better actually. My tumors have shrunk, a quick little surgery coming up and I‚Äôll be in remission.\n\nI have a business, it‚Äôs not doing so well because I‚Äôm not. Some days I have all the energy, others like today, zero.\nI pray to God to help me\nOut of this one. I owe my dealer $700 but he‚Äôs nice and understanding. I pay him a set amount each month until It‚Äôs paid for. I haven‚Äôt asked him for any Hydros because I don‚Äôt want more debt. \n\nWhat can I take so WD‚Äôs won‚Äôt be so bad? I have 20 days to go and hopefully I can go back to Norco‚Äôs?\n\nMy pain doctor knew I was coming off a regimen where I was getting 470 20mg OxyContin a month and 360 IR Oxycodone a month and did not help me taper. She just threw 15mg Oxy at me and said that‚Äôs all she can do. \n\nI hold myself responsible to a degree. Because I take more than I should but my body was used to these mega doses. \n\nSo with the meds I have: \nGabapentin \nLyrica\nKlonopin\nAdvil for pain \nBaclofen \nTramadol\nOlanzapine\n\nI honestly am scared of Tramadol and Baclofen, I feel these are what put me in the ER. I stopped taking them CT. While I was out of Oxy I would take 1 Gaba 1 Baclofen and 4 Trams and felt great. But I stopped CT when my Oxy was refilled. I was on these 2 weeks. So I‚Äôm sure these are what caused the tremors and high heart rate.\n\nHow can I make WD not as bad? Do I have to go back on Tramadol and slowly taper? I haven‚Äôt taken any in 10 days. Or Baclofen? I haven‚Äôt taken any also in 10 days because I‚Äôm scared of Seratonin Syndrome.\n\nMy plan is to use these 20 days to be free, and then when it‚Äôs refill day, tell my doctor to put me back on Norco and take as prescribed for my pain.\n\nI‚Äôm scared. Please help, once my surgery is done and I‚Äôm in remission, I want to be sober and have my life back. Right now with my pain and issues it seems impossible. I‚Äôm sad my cancer center labeled me a drug seeker. But it is what it is, I don‚Äôt go there anymore because of how embarrassing it is. I see a new oncologist.\n\nHow much of these should I take to not feel sick? Or as sick? I want to enjoy Thanksgiving dinner with my family, it‚Äôs already a lot having to speak about my cancer. It makes me depressed. But I know they‚Äôll ask. \n\nPlease help me, I read vitamin C helps too?? My refill is the 15th, seems like forever. \n",

    "selftext": "If you‚Äôre going through opiate withdrawal and the Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) is bad, hear me out! I‚Äôve learned that RLS is essentially your legs demanding extreme, unrelenting attention. Here‚Äôs why:\n\nOur brain‚Äôs dopamine receptors, which are crucial for pleasure and movement, are left open and empty after prolonged substance use. Dopamine typically provides euphoric sensations, even greater than sexual pleasure, and is responsible for movement. When you move to scratch an itch or take any action, that movement triggers a small release of dopamine, creating a ‚Äúreward‚Äù sensation. However, during withdrawal, dopamine levels drop drastically, leaving your legs begging for any form of stimulation, resulting in involuntary movement and discomfort.\n\nHere‚Äôs a method that has helped me alleviate RLS during withdrawal:\n\t1.\tUnderstand the Sensation: When your legs cramp up or feel twisted, don‚Äôt fight it. Instead, give your RLS your full attention. Focus on what it feels like‚Äîimagine its weight, texture, shape, or even color. Does it feel like heavy boots or chains? Try to visualize this sensation deeply.\n\t2.\tIntroduce Controlled Temperature Changes:\n\t‚Ä¢\tPrepare a frozen Ziploc bag (wrapped in a grocery bag for insulation) and keep it under your blanket.\n\t‚Ä¢\tAlternate between the warmth of your blanket and the cool sensation provided by the bag. Place your feet near the cold part of the blanket, not directly on the ice, to prevent overstimulation.\n\t3.\tSwitch Between Hot and Cold: When you can no longer focus on the imagined sensation of RLS, move your feet to the cold area under the blanket. Let your body register the change in temperature, which stimulates the nerves and provides temporary relief. Once the cramping resumes, repeat the process by shifting back to the warm area.\n\t4.\tOther Remedies:\n\t‚Ä¢\tMedications like gabapentin or over-the-counter supplements such as magnesium may help ease symptoms. (Always consult a doctor before trying these.)\n\t‚Ä¢\tExercise can also alleviate symptoms, even mild stretches or movement.\n\nAlthough this approach doesn‚Äôt cure RLS, it provides brief moments of relief, which can feel invaluable during withdrawal. For those enduring this, even a few seconds of respite can be a lifeline. Keep experimenting with these techniques and stay strong‚Äîyou‚Äôre not alone in this fight.",

It also caused me to have to shit as soon as I sat on toilet (lol) then eventually extreme hallucinations, coming in and out of consciousness and not being able to talk, move, or open my eyes.. the weird thing is the paramedics tried accusing me of being in behaviour for attention to go to the hospital due to the fact while all this was going on when they would open my eyelids I could see & move my eyes and my pupils would respond, but if they rubbed my sternum there was 0 response, no reflex. I‚Äôd also be hallucinating at the same time so it‚Äôs super weird after recovering because you have to figure out what was reality and what was hallucinations. It also caused irregular arrhythmia, and a heart rate of almost 180.\n  Hopefully this post will help educate people about the risk of this happening due to drug abuse, id recommend anyone who thinks it may be happening to them to immediately go to the hospital before it progresses and you can‚Äôt help yourself. Taking benzodiazepines helps reverse it a long with stopping all drugs that raise seratonin levels!",

But I didn't follow anyone of the \"methods\".  \n\nI'm watching Grey's Anatomy now And there's an episode about a girl who goes through a week-long detox in it (lol). Brought back some questions I had at the time.\n\nI didn't try all of these options back then and am wondering how much easier it would've been.\n\nWhat does lyrica/gabapentin solve? The leg aches? (I never had RLS thank g-d. Massive leg aches though.) I have always been prescribed gabapentin, but never took it more than a week or so. I tried it and it did nothing for the chronic pain I had so I never took it again (even though I had a lot). It never did anything for me.  Would it have helped but aching legs, that almost broke me.\n\nWhat does clonidine solve?  The freezing morning feeling?  Wish I would have known that.\n\nXanax, obviously helped me tremendously to sleep and to get some kind of instant results when I needed to feel not deathly.  I have always taken it (small amounts, didn't even change my regular usage) for anxiety before, during and after the cold turkey.  Anxiety runs through my family bad, and Xanax is a wonder drug for that.\n\nVitamin c?  What could this possibly have done for me?  I mean I drank orange juice (I always stayed hydrated).\n\nMy main issues I had to deal with were waking up freezing in the morning, and feeling extremely anxious a couple times a day, and stomach issues but I knew I could deal with all those, never started far from a toilet! The aching legs were something that almost broke me though.\n\nAfter reading almost this entire Reddit, I probably would retry the Gabapentin for the aching legs, use clonidine in the morning to get a little warmth in me, and use a lot more vitamin c because everyone seems to believe in it, stick with the Xanax, but use a lot more Pepto and Imodium to manage my stomach. (I have IBS, so have acid issues and had diarrhea during withdrawal).\n\nI'm not looking for withdrawal advice, I really just want to know what each of the meds I listed is supposed to address - it's not clear to me after reading everything.  And I know a lot of things are subjective, especially after reading all the posts here. \n\nSorry for the rambling, but it's something those of us here on this Reddit do. \n\nMuch love.",

It‚Äôs been pretty constant withdrawal. I‚Äôll go 2-3 days, crack and do some for a day, rinse and repeat. \n\nThis time I‚Äôm really, really over it. Today is day 6 and I‚Äôm just so tired of feeling shitty. My withdrawals really aren‚Äôt shit compared to what they used to be, but ever since my sub withdrawal they make me so panicked. I have a two year old and five year old. I refuse to let my drug use affect my kids (even though I‚Äôm sure in some ways it has despite my efforts) so I‚Äôm still on my feet all day, taking them to do things, playing, etc. This week I‚Äôll work 50 hours at a high-intensity, physical job.

My stomach is fucked so I‚Äôm trying a thing I read about where you take an antacid before Imodium because supposedly it helps ease withdrawal symptoms. Have been taking small doses of adderall for the past few days.

My parents also live an hour and a half away and I stay there with them 2-3 nights per week. \n\nI‚Äôm from the UK so codeine is available OTC and the pharmacy worker will just ask a few questions and give them to you. Because of this, and alongside the added pressure of working 50 hour weeks and looking after my family whenever I can, I didn‚Äôt realise right away but over time I noticed I was taking more and more and more. \n\nI‚Äôm at the point now where on a morning I need 200mg of Codeine before I can even leave my house, much like people are with coffee. \n\nI‚Äôm writing this as I am done, I am mentally, physically, emotional, and spiritually done with all of this. This has ruined my self esteem, it‚Äôs diminishing my savings, and it‚Äôs ruining my relationships with my friends and my family.  I‚Äôm a 29yo female and on some days, I look in the mirror and I don‚Äôt see myself at all, I just see the addiction. \n\nI‚Äôve got an appointment with CGL tomorrow which is the primary drug and alcohol service in England, and I‚Äôm so overwhelmed and unsure about what will happen with it, and I apologise because my addiction is not as severe a as some people, I just needed an outlet with people who understand. \n\nIs there anything I should be asking them once I go to this appointment tomorrow, or anything I should keep in mind while attending? \n\nI work in pharmacy which is obviously one of the worst careers to have while living with this addiction, and this is what scares me the most.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated and thank you all for reading :) ",

I am so proud of myself!! \n\nA year ago‚Äî I was doing about 12-15 blues a day spending about $100 a day! I couldn‚Äôt go much past 6 hours without starting to feel like I was going through withdrawal. I had given up all other happy aspects of my life and was solely working to buy drugs; I gave up my car, my comfortable housing, buying anything for myself even like food or clothes despite making about $200 a day bartending‚Ä¶  I would be soo desperate to re-up. Waking up sick, be it summer or winter- willing to walk or bike or anyway possible to meet my plug and wait around sick for whenever they decided‚Ä¶ I think most of what I don‚Äôt miss of being an addict; is the hopeless feeling of needing more; and that anxiety of finding money, a ride, is the plug around, even the weather( buffalo ny snow storms shut us down sometimes for a week at a time). Yet here I am; driving in storms I shouldn‚Äôt, spending every penny I had, getting loans; etc‚Äî and now it‚Äôs been an entire year since I‚Äôve picked up. \n\nI want to give some helpful maybe things I wish I knew about recovery‚Äî it is soo worth it, and beautiful and bittersweet and hard and rewarding.  Even when your clean; its not as simple as being clean; PAWS sticks around for a bit so please don‚Äôt get discouraged. Also a huge reminded that I must tell myself all of the time‚Äî- I might not be where I want to be, but look at where I was and where I came from. I struggle a lot currently with the financial ruins I left myself in after addiction, and without a vehicle etc; I can‚Äôt get well paying jobs bc of where I live, etc- but despite that; I still bike my ass to work and little by little, depressed or not- show up for myself trying to dig myself out. If I ever become financially independent; I have a goal to help addicts and victims of mental health‚Äî have a place they can go to; that‚Äôs not solely for recovery; but the aftermath of recovery. Something maybe like a life coach? Idk what the definition would be but somebody to help you reorganize your life; help you with legal issues, financial troubles- and where to start, help people re get ids and licenses;  push for programs to truly give people a fresh chance and start. \n\nIf I can get clean and stay clean, I promise you- you can get and stay clean.  If I can help anybody; my dms are always open; even just a friend to listen or be there while you withdrawal. Thank you to everybody on this sub helping support me, answering questions, sharing their stories, and a big thanks for Saul for everything he does on this subreddit. I love yall.",

    "title": "My fiance is in withdrawal and I feel resentful\n",
    "selftext": "I don't feel great this evening - I just got angry at my fiance while he was in wd in bed. I said things I regret saying, accusing him of putting the illness on, of deliberately being lazy and uncommunicative to hurt me.\n\nThe context:\n\nMy fiance was heroin addict for 10 years. We got together when he got clean. What I didn't realise that subox comes with its own problems. His suboxone made him feel very depressed after 6 months of using it, and for the last 6 months he's not been himself. Unable to leave the house most weekends, lacking in emotion, lacking in motivation or interests. I've felt quite neglected, disappointed and not supported at times where I've needed him. I cook for him and try to support him, offer new ways to feel better, inspire him, suggest gentle activities.\n\nThings hit an all time low a month or so ago. After many months of feeling dissatisfied and somewhat isolated, living with this person I love but somehow isn't really the person I knew - because the medication changes him every day - I decided to go on a trip that was a once in a lifetime opportunity for me. I knew I needed to take this time for myself. But the problem was, his suboxone depression had got so bad, he'd taken to using heroin again. I found this out a few days before I left. I was very worried to leave him - a friend of mine just died from heroin overdose, heroin is so unsafe now, all mixed with fentanyl etc. There have been a number of deaths related to fentanyl & nitazines in my area. I tried to put some safety measures in place, contacting his friends and family asking them to look out for him, arranging him to stay with parents etc. I had arranged for him to come and meet me abroad after my trip for a short holiday so he could take a break from work, regather his senses in a nice sunny place. He said he would book his flights just after I left.\n\nAs soon as I was out of the country, he went MIA. Didn't contact me, couldn't send me a single text or call. I was meant to be away two weeks, with him joining me in week 2, but had to cut short because I was so scared of what might have happened to him. I returned home half expecting to find him dead in our flat. Fortunately, I got back and he was alive, but very sick and in the throes of relapse. He had crashed his car, wasn't going to work, etc. He was shocked to see me. He said he hadn't been able to message because he was so ashamed. Him not getting in touch with me ultimately ruined this trip that had meant so much to me, because I was worrying about him every second of every day, and couldn't fully be present. I was furious, but tried to be pragmatic. I told his parents about the situation, who were actually great and very supportive. They confiscated the keys to his car and since then, he has been serious about recovering. I've tried to communicate to them not to give him money, help too much etc to prevent enabling. He has gone cold turkey and is no longer on the suboxone. He's walking to work which is doing him good, and his personality seems to be coming back. It's been about a month since he last used, but Suboxone withdrawal is notoriously long, and I'm already fed up with it and I'm struggling to see the end of this whole thing. \n\nI am trying my best to balance being supportive but also not enabling by doing too much. \n\nI need to admit, I know this isn't his fault, and he is trying his best - but I'm resentful about how much time I've spent waiting for him to be himself, to be present with me and in our relationship. Today I found out my granddad has 3 months to live, and two days ago that my uncle had a stroke. I am struggling to cope and am myself sick and run down.\n\nTonight I felt awful because I lashed out and put the blame on him, because he said he would cook tonight, but felt too bad to do it. His symptoms are very mysterious and he's fine one minute and feeling awful the next. His personality changes and I struggle to adjust. I apologised and said I knew it wasn't his fault, that I was just frustrated and burnt out. I wouldn't want someone to treat me this way if I was ill. He said it was his worst nightmare, having someone being stressed and frustrated while he was in wd. He said he wishes I would just go away.\n\nBut when I did actually go away I think he felt abandoned, though he wouldn't have said this - and I think this played into the relapse. He said one night angrily 'I didn't want you to go'. He was afraid of himself and what might happen if he was left alone. At the same time, when the withdrawal flares up, he wants nothing to do with me. I know I need to be strong. But I feel spontaneously so angry at all this time and love that has been lost since this began. So much of our time together is just spent in bed gormlessly watching TV it's driving me insane. I'm scared he will never come back, that I won't be strong enough to wait this out with maturity and patience. It's not the first time I've been angry. I know his soul hurts, and he needs a lot of healing - a deeper healing. He is a religious person, he has faith and I know he has the potential. I know how horrible it must be for someone to be impatient about your recovery - I've experienced this too in past relationships and with my parents when I've been sick. \n\nWe live far away from friends and from my family. I've been trying to travel more, see friends, but I worry about staying out anywhere late in case he relapses. I also know I need to trust him and can't live like that. I'm losing a sense of myself too.\n\nI want to stay with him, though I have considered leaving. Does anyone have any advice for me, as to how to act appropriately - balancing my own emotional needs (which can become like a petulant child) and his recovery? I already have a therapist...",

    "selftext": "Hi all. I have recently gotten on suboxone after my most recent run. I am hoping to not be on suboxone long-term but before I just throw that to the side I want some real-life experience feedback from people who have had quite a bit of clean time recently (either on MAT or not, don't care) and what type of group therap my or one-on-one type things people have been using that helps them break the cycle of pleasure-seeking addiction. Even with my medications like suboxone and gabapentin I still feel like I'm chasing the dragon and need a significant change to go on jn my brain. I have tried AA/NA about 8 years ago when I was younger but I don't think I was very serious about it, but I'm am also not averse to it if it's working for people (I was only 18-20 at the time). For those who don't do AA/NA, what has worked to rewire and get you the tools you need? CBT? Other medications? Therapy? That's what I am wondering.\n\nJust a little background about me if desired: I am somewhat young (26) and have had periods of sobriety (up to 2 years at one point, another 2-3 years later but was still drinking nightly) and stints of relapses (sometimes quite long, many substances but mostly relegated to opioids). That longest period of sobriety was on probation and obviously I went through quite a bit of court ordered classes and mandatory AA when I was 18 until I was about 20 to avoid a felony (drug court if you have it in your state is what it was). I didn't take recovery seriously back then but I am married now and want to have kids and I want to save my family the heartbreak of me being in active addiction. I want to break the cycle but I feel like I need some serious changes in my mind to happen. I do workout and I plan on increasing that to more like 5 days a week and I am continuing to get more vitamins, sunshine, and doing other healthy activities with my wife as a support system and the rest of my family. \n\nTLDR: Finally getting clean again and hoping to get off suboxone reasonably quickly if possible. Wondering what kind of group or one-on-one therapies have helped the most to break the cycle of opioid addiction. ",

    "selftext": "So I consider myself almost 4 years sober. I used to be a pretty hard user. I had an overdose at one point which, long story short, made things worse and i ended up using even more. But almost four years ago, I reached my wits end and I went through a detox program. I got prescribed Suboxone by my doctor and I‚Äôve been on it ever since. I started out at the maximum dose and have since tapered down to a very low dose. I know at this point I could probably stop taking it and have very little withdrawals but I don‚Äôt want to get fully off of it. I know that if I quit, I won‚Äôt have that safety net that being in the program provides. For one, I can‚Äôt do any other drugs because I get tested by my program regularly. Plus I know that I can‚Äôt take other opiates on Suboxone since it won‚Äôt actually work. The program provides accountability and I like it. \n\nBut lately I‚Äôve just felt really empty inside. Ive thought about relapsing a lot recently and I would really like some extra help. I haven‚Äôt been attending any kind of NA program since I got ‚Äúclean‚Äù but I would really like to. \n\nHowever, I occasionally drink. I never really had a problem with alcohol but just to safe, I have strict rules about it. I can only drink in a social setting (aka not alone) and I can only have 2 drinks max. Also, shortly after getting clean I saw a physiatrist who diagnosed me with ADHD so now I am also prescribed Ritalin. I also take Gabapentin for RLS. I don‚Äôt abuse any of the medications I am on but I know that most NA meetings are super strict that you can‚Äôt be on anything. So I‚Äôm worried they won‚Äôt accept me as sober because I‚Äôm on Suboxone, plus the other medications, and because I occasionally have a beer. In my mind, I haven‚Äôt been high on Opiates in almost four years so I consider that sober but I don‚Äôt know. What‚Äôs do you guys think? ",

    "selftext": "Hey yall, just wanted to come on here and give you guys a bit of a back story and some things that have helped me along the way. \n\nI 30(M) started using (Percocet) back in 2021 and was using consistently for about 3 1/2 years. It had reached a point where I was spending about 4k$ every other week to keep up with the habit. Snorting/popping anywhere from 10-25 pills a day. At some point it switched over to fentanyl, not really sure when/didnt care at the time, but I felt like I was drowning. \n\nDeciding to get clean was one of the hardest things I‚Äôve ever done in my life. Both mentally and physically. The withdrawals are INSANE. I never imagined just how rough it would be. The first few days being dope sick, fine. I knew what that already felt like if I couldn‚Äôt get my fix in time, but it‚Äôs when you‚Äôre 2-3/4 weeks  in when your head starts playing games with you.\n\n You start genuinely questioning, ‚Äúam I ever going to feel better?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat is the point of all this?‚Äù ‚ÄúI guess im going to feel like this forever‚Äù This, at least for me, was WAY HARDER than the initial physical sickness. This is also where I noticed I started feeling sorry for myself and the thought of using again started creeping back in. I can say with complete confidence that becoming a victim or having a victims mentality will lead you back to using.\n\n I want anyone who is reading this and currently withdrawing to understand, \n\nYOU‚ÄôRE NOT A VICTIM. YOU‚ÄôRE A FUCKING WARRIOR.\n\nThis shit ain‚Äôt easy but only you can beat this. Get ANGRY. Get angry at the addiction, use that anger as motivation. Opiates are the enemy, withdrawal is the enemy, those thoughts of using again are the enemy. treat them with hostility. \n\nIf my sorry ass can beat this. You sure as shit can too. \n\nEdit: I, by no means, am out of the woods yet. But from where I was six months ago, it feels like a lifetime of change has occurred. IT DOES GET BETTER I PROMISE!! ",

So this is where it comes to an end. \n\nI‚Äôm in hellish withdrawals right now but I‚Äôm finally starting to feel emotion again, feeling again, whether it‚Äôs good or bad! People take feeling/emotions for granted. They don‚Äôt realize these drugs have stripped all of those from me over these last 4 years. Its held me back from my true potential. \n\nI‚Äôve hit a breakthrough. The drug isn‚Äôt the problem it‚Äôs the solution, the problem is deep down is not being able to look at yourself in the mirror. But I know when these withdrawals are over I will be more than content than ever with my existence.\n\nI know deep down that if I don‚Äôt put a stop to this for good I won‚Äôt ever find that young person who before they made the decision to snort that oxy, was so creative and full of life with big hopes and dreams. Had no problem getting the girl they loved. \n\nI‚Äôm not gonna be a Slave to see either of the drugs mentioned including my good frenemie, suboxone. The only credit I give it is bringing me to this realization now. It doesn‚Äôt even make me feel ‚Äúnormal‚Äù hah maybe neutral at best. What I‚Äôm tryna feel is my authentic self again. So I‚Äôm putting an end to this nightmare once and for all. \n\nI hit a point in my recovery journey previously where I weened down from 14mg of suboxone all the way to 1mg and and attempted to quit suboxone cold turkey. Unfortunately I failed but it was a part of the process to get to here \nAnd having experienced pws many times  I know what to expect and to be honest the fentanyl withdrawals are a lot more bearable than suboxons withdrawals themselves. I‚Äôm aware these symptoms could get worse over the next few days but I‚Äôve been preparing my mind for this for awhile and I‚Äôve got my window of opportunity to do this and I can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel \n\n If you‚Äôve seen what I‚Äôve been through- from my dad dying in my arms at age 13 to me building a drug empire during high school to fill the financial void there were other various motivations but fueled with anger at the world I used that as my drive to reach  a kingpin drug network status at age 19 but of course good things don‚Äôt last for ever but what ultimately lead to the crash was the beginning of my addiction during the end of my run, you get lazy you start making heat decisions so it was inevitable at that point that the swat team kick my door in and gas me out, leading to me being tried for 10 years in prison and getting off on 2 years. \n\nSo believe me when I tell you this‚Ä¶ I have the strength to overcome this part of my life \n\nIf you reconcile with my story and this post gains traction I will be happy to provide updates over these next days of hell or if this is something youre planning on doing and have any questions about what comfort meds help that I‚Äôm taking I would be happy to answer! I need to keep busy! I got lots of more stories to tell too so don‚Äôt be afraid to reach out to me!\n\nFrom one Addict to another I‚Äôm signing off for the night i got a long night of withdraws ahead of me ",

It may be an obvious and stupid question for some but I have been thinking about it a lot recently, especially in withdrawal. I just wonder how much different my life would be if I never started down this road. More specifically, I have been thinking about the first time or two I picked up/got prescribed opioids and wondered if life would be different if those two days never happened. It's possible/likely I would have eventually found those drugs down the road I guess. Now, I'm a \"high-functioning\" addict who really has only hit bottom once about 8 years ago, and it's generally been uphill from there. Despite this, I feel like my bouts of addiction since then have still damaged me in some ways. My memory feels way worse, I find myself in cycles of using and withdrawing all the time, and I just struggle to find relief, happiness, and satisfaction in daily life sober. I imagine this is not the case for people who use because they are truly mentally ill, but I feel like at my baseline I would have been extremely high functioning and happy if I had never picked up opioids. I don't feel hopeless I think there still can be happy sobriety in my future but I have been thinking way too much about that time I stole my dad's hydrocodone when I was 14 which has apparently led me to where I'm at today.\n\nTLDR: How often or what do you think about if the first time you picked up opioids never happened?

    "selftext": "\\*Trigger warning\\* - I am now 8 months clean but coming to terms with my 1st and only OD.  Felt like writing about it.\n\n**BACKSTORY -**¬†40M - Got clean at 23 from oxy and really got into health and fitness which kept me sober for 14 years. Then, in 2021 after getting a bottle of Vicodin for wisdom teeth removed, I relapsed. They say it \"gets worse\", but I had no clue how scary shit was about to get.\n\n**THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING -**¬†In just 3 months I went from taking 2 pills a day, to snorting up to 30 fent pills a day, usually 4x at a time and barely getting high. Is this really happening? This can't be real I'd often think, I felt psychotic like I truly was dreaming. I'd spent my entire adult life thriving and was the \"comeback kid\"...and where the fuck did it all go wrong. I went from the highest of highs to the loneliest place I'd ever known....and I've been to prison. This was worse! I'd spend the next 3 years solely existing to avoid the anxiety of withdrawal. Like my favorite artist once said¬†***\"In such a place you either breathe or you suffocate\"***.\n\n**SHIT'S ABOUT TO GET REAL-**¬†In March of this year after briefly getting clean (about 3 weeks) I went to a strip club with friends for a bday party and I wound up agreeing to take ecstasy with a stripper at my place that night. The comedown was super rough and she winds up offering me fetty. Pain is a hell of a motivator..I agree but confess I'd been clean for months and can only \"do a little\". She winds up leaving me 2 tiny lines, a fraction of what I would previously take and leaves to go home. I take half of the first line and go to water my plant before going to sleep. I then lose my balance and.....\n\n**THE MOMENT I KNEW I FUCKED UP-**¬†I had never relapsed before so I don't know anything about what it feels like. I remember grabbing my plant as I fall to the floor in the corner of my apartment, and I also remember the feeling of landing on my hip HARD. I tried to shake it off and stand up, but it was unlike anything I've ever experienced...I couldn't move. I was conscious, and could contract my muscles...but it was like my strength had instantly been reduced to 10%. I used my arms to pull myself to the couch and almost got standing back up...only to fall again. I live alone (just me and my dog) and so I sat there in excruciating hip pain, on the floor...confused what was happening, scared. I thought I broke my hip? Or maybe I just needed to \"shake it off\"? I thought maybe if I just sleep on the floor for a while I'll wake up and be able to stand.\n\nI wake up on the floor maybe 3 hours later and now my hip is on fire!!! I need to stop this pain. I need to take the rest of the fentanyl..then I'll be ok! \\*I tell myself\\*. So I try to crawl, but leg strength is at 5% now. Upper body strength slightly better...so I crawl...inch by inch, dragging my legs over my hard wood floors. Soon enough, my legs are red, raw, and starting to bleed. I...MUST...GET...PAIN...RELIEF. I finally get to kitchen and raise my arm to the plate with fetty and it falls on the ground. I sniff the fetty powder off my kitchen floor and pass out again while trying to crawl back to my bedroom. I wake up and the sun is rising and I now know I need an ambulance...but have no idea where my phone is. I'm yelling for help hoping someone in the hallway hears me. I try invoking Siri on my Mac to call 911...but nothing is working. I finally crawl through my blood, into my bedroom and with just enough reach..grab phone off bed...10 minutes later I'm in an ambulance.\n\n**\"YOU WILL NOT WALK AGAIN FOR 2 YEARS\" -**¬†The next morning I sit in the ICU with tubes in my lungs, a catheter in my chest and in my penis (yup...you read that correctly). My family has flown in from 3 different states to the news of my toxicology report (as they thought I was dying, they decided to tell my family..I still think this is a violation of HIPAA, but here we are). My family is demoralized and once again I feel like I'm dreaming...this just can't be real.\n\nThe doctors begin to tell me that I have an extreme and potentially fatal case of rhabdomylosis. Rhabdo for short, aka \"muscle death\" as it's nicknamed. Normally extreme athletes get this from muscular overuse.. But in my case, it was from laying on the ground for too long a period of time. Paramedics estimate in total I've been on the floor for about 30 hours. My muscle cells had started to break down and die and flooded my body with toxins that my kidneys could not handle. They said I was in kidney failure, had severe muscle and nerve damage, drop foot, a serious hematoma on my left hip and multiple concussions.\n\nThey told my family I had about a 4% chance of survival as my kidneys were not responding to dialysis after my first week there‚Ä¶ towards the end of my first week in the ICU the doctors would tell me they think I'm going to survive, but that my life is going to significantly change. They tell me I won't be walking for 18 months to two years and I'll be on dialysis for 10 years minimum and potentially the rest of my life because of how bad my kidneys were damaged.\n\n21 days later I took my first steps. I was off dialysis about 2 weeks after that. Doctors were stunned and said they'd never seen a recovery like this. But I would still spend the next two months in an inpatient physical therapy learning to walk again.\n\n**THE PERFECT LIE & MYSTERY SCAR**¬†\\- In addiction, we lie to the bitter end. The shame, the guilt, the denial...clinging to any version of the truth that doesn't let our families see who we really are. Any lie that helps remind us that deep down, we are a GOOD person and that we truly want to be better but just need a little more time to get there. That we are caring, and that we are so much more than an \"addict\". So when the doctor said I must have fallen and hit my head and got a concussion...I attached myself to that lie. \"Yes that's exactly what happened. I fell and hit my head...this was an accident, not an OD. Yes..I admit, I relapsed. But I didn't use the day of the accident, I simply tripped while watering my plant and fell backwards hitting my head on the corner of my coffee table.\"\n\n.....Only I DIDN'T fall and hit my head. So how the FUCK did I get¬†[this perfect line](https://imgur.com/a/CDEr7HP) for a scar¬†that looks exactly like I hit my head. The blood from my knees getting cut up on floor made a good cover for the head injury story...but I remember the night pretty well and definitely did not have a head injury.\n\n**CAN ANYONE FIGURE OUT WHAT CAUSED THIS SCAR?? -**¬†I've heard tranq can do some crazy shit leaving people with sores and other horrifying skin issues. As far as I know I didn't have any of that in my system. Tox report showed MDMA, fentanyl, and morphine. Now, what I do remember is that for the first week in the hospital no one mentioned anything on my head, not even doctors or nurses. But the oxygen they had me hooked up to was causing my scalp to itch, so I kept scratching my head. I'd keep feeling like I had something sticky in my hair. I thought it was my hair gel from prior to accident being clumped in hair and drying out as I had not showered for a week in ICU (gross, I know!)\n\nFast forward to a week later, a doctor then sees it and says \"oh you've got a head injury.\" and says they want to shave around the area to clean it. He shows me a mirror of the injury and it didn't look big or anything like what you see in photo of it now. For some reason, he shaves a HUGE line into my head way bigger than needed. And since that moment, barely any hair has grown back and this scar has not healed in the 8 months since my accident. Can anyone explain how fentanyl could have done this? Can anyone think of anything else I'm missing here? I will now forever have a scar that deep down, knowing my \"real\" story...I can't explain.\n\nThis is the first time I've written bout the truth of what happened. I am now 8 months clean off fentanyl but still tapering off subutex. They had me on oxy for months and I told them I didn't want to keep taking a full opiate and so I declined pain management.\n\nI am walking fine, working out daily, back to work and even hiking again. But the nerve injury I suffered was brutal. It's getting better, but I can appreciate how lucky I am now that it's getting getter.\n\nThanks for listening to this LONG story haha.Just felt I needed to share",

    "selftext": "My (32M) brother (34M) has had chronic liver disease nearly my entire life, for which he received a liver transplant back in 2011.  Whilst recovering from the transplant surgery, he received massive amounts of pain medication and became dependent on them.  When the doctors cut him off he moved on to heroin, and then fentanyl when the heroin went away.  I also began using around the time that he did, and we moved in together during covid in 2020.  \n\nWe enabled each other and spent every single dollar we could on drugs until May of this year, when our landlord finally had enough and evicted us.  We both moved back in with our parents at that time.  Come July, my parents finally  had enough, because we continued using under their roof yet again, and kicked me out (my brother was allowed to stay because of his relatively poor health).  I was homeless for a bit, then decided to go to the hospital to treat a serious infection in my arm that was threatening the limb itself.  I got that started on the mend, and then decided to go into treatment.  \n\nI successfully completed detox at the hospital (HIGHLY recommend doing that vs going to a detox facility... way better), albeit on methadone (both he and I have been on methadone for years, and still used + sold the bottles to buy more drugs), initial residential treatment, then an extended residential program for over 2 months, and am now entering my 3rd month at a sober house.  This is the longest I have been sober since I was a teenager... 4 months last week.\n\nMy brother continued using this entire time, and I kind of lived my drug fantasies since I was clean vicariously through him, though this was nothing particularly out of the ordinary; we'd always congratulate each other on a score or when we came into some cash.  I even sent him small amounts of money, even though I knew he would use it for drugs.  I knew these things were wrong, not only for my recovery, though I did kind of use it as urge-surfing in a way, but for him and his health, but I still did them because that's what he and I have done for years and years now and it just seemed so everyday.\n\nCome 2 weeks ago.  He entered the hospital with elevated WBCs,  bilirubin, and liver enzymes.  This was nothing too abnormal... he's had infections dozens of times that have required hospitalizations.  The bilirubin was a faint alarm bell, because that wasn't usually elevated.  He got slightly worse over the course of the first week, but again, especially in patients like him who have suppressed immune systems, infections get worse before they get better.\n\n1 week ago.  He stops texting me.  I call his room number, and he doesn't pick up.  I call the nurse, and she says he's been moved to a step-down unit.  She says the liver graft is \"basically shot.\"  Alarm bells immediately start blaring in my head, I let my dad know.  His kidneys are failing, and his liver numbers skyrocketed.  His WBCs leaped to 123 (ANC responsible for the rise).  My dad goes in the next day, and receives the news that without transplantation, my brother is going to die.  With an infection, and with the kidney failure, and substance abuse, and a history of noncompliance with appointments and medications, he isn't eligible for a transplant.  He is going to die.\n\nHe remains \"okay\" throughout the week, the infection gets a bit better, and his mental state seems mostly okay, though he is very weak and in pain.  Come Friday, his mental state precipitously declines, and he can barely answer questions anymore.  I visited today, and the doctor essentially told me he could die at any time.  He was in terrible shape.  He is yellow from the jaundice, his respiratory rate is barely enough.  He can only open his eyes for seconds at a time, he can't eat a thing.  I insisted that they place an NG tube because he was severely underweight even before admission.\n\nAnyway, you all don't need to know this.  I'm just typing because my brother is by far my best friend, for good or for ill, and he's going to die, and it's, at least because I've sent him money recently, at least partly my fault.  I also was the one who supervised his medicine while I was with him, and I told my parents to do this, and they apparently didn't!  I'm so upset, I feel guilty and responsible for this too and for leaving. \n\nI know relapsing will make everything worse, but how am I supposed to go on once he's gone?  I've never lost anyone before.  I know he is an adult and is responsible for his own choices, and I will forever be going over the choices I did or didn't make over these past months for the rest of my life, but this guilt is going to eat me alive.  \n\nHelp\n\nUpdate as of Monday, November 18th:\n\nHe is in the ICU on continuous dialysis and on a ventilator.  He is also getting blood pressure support via pressors.  Last 4 days his kidney and liver function have improved somewhat.  I'm cautiously hopeful, but as I've gotten to know, anything can happen at any time in this kind of setting (ICU).  The doctors think that a latent condition called amyloidosis that may run in my family has flared up and hurt his kidneys and liver, with the infection in the background really hurting him too.  The infection looks like it's cleared up.  He's needed *five* blood transfusions, but his hemoglobin is holding steady as of the last few days.\n\nYou guys have been great.  He might pull through this.  Please send thoughts and or prayers his way... please.  Thanks.",

    "selftext": "EDIT: *I'm new to this forum and don't use Reddit very often, so I make some rookie mistakes (including writing too much and asking too many questions, lol). **Please feel free to let me know if the below post is just too long and unnecessarily detailed to read thru, or needs to be formatted better, etc...and I'll edit it accordingly. Or any other tips on how to improve my posts.* Thanks!!\n\nHi all, \n\nSo I'm transitioning from 2-mgs of Suboxone twice daily (totaling 4-mgs every 24 hours) and starting the 100-mg Sublocade shot for the first time next week. Ideally, the plan is to only get this Sublocade shot one time, then let it gradually leave my system as a final form of tapering off the medication/buprenorphine altogether. (Obviously, my doctor and I have some backup options in case this doesn't work out as planned.)\n\nBut from what I'm told by both my doctor and my pharmacist, the weaning process should not be too difficult. \n\nMy doc makes it sound like a cakewalk‚Äîlike this Sublocade shot will basically slowly leave my system, my brain and body will adapt to it, and I'll barely notice any withdrawal symptoms. \n\nMy pharmacist was more straightforward and real with me, saying that I might experience some withdrawal and that everyone is different. etc.. \n\nHowever, she did *not* go into the intensity of said potential withdrawal (like, are we talking detox-off-opiates-level misery? Or mild aches and sniffles? And for how long?)\n\nOn the other hand, she **did** essentially echo my docs theory that my brain/body will adapt as the Sublocade shot leaves my system after one month, which sounds hopeful?\n\nShe reassured me that the transition off Sublocade should not be overly challenging considering my current low Suboxone dosage, the reduced starting dose of Sublocade (100 mg instead of the typical 300 mg), and the fact that this is my first/only experience with the injection.\nShe also emphasized that more severe withdrawal symptoms tend to occur in individuals who initiate treatment with higher doses of Suboxone or Sublocade, those who use it for an extended period, or those who abruptly discontinue higher doses without tapering.\n\nThe thing is, while of course hearing this is encouraging, this option sounds a little too good to be true. \n\n**Question:**\n\n- I guess I'm just looking to hear more experiences from other people out there who have *actually* experienced going through this, or know people who have‚Äîrather than just from medical professionals who have only heard or read about it in *theory.*\n\n- More specifically, it would be helpful to hear from anyone who switched from a similarly low dose of Suboxone, started off on the 100-mg Sublocade shot and/or only received one dose of the Sublocade shot, then weaned off of it completely after that. \n\n**That said, any and all forms of advice or thoughts are welcome.** üôÇ\n\nI'm mainly asking because I've heard tell of some bad experiences going off Sublocade. (For ex: people will wean off of it and feel fine for a while, but then when it finally fully leaves their system, the real withdrawal kicks in...hard.) And I don't have a backup plan for that, yet.\n\nOf course, I'd love to hear otherwise, lol! But as others here know, none of this has been *easy* from the start (duh). Being an addict was miserable. Detox was hell. Staying clean was pretty difficult, at first. And tapering down from 12 mg to 2 mg Suboxone was no picnic, either (albeit easier than I expected it to be). \n\n...And so I just can't imagine that, after several yrs of opiate addiction followed by reliance on buprenorphine, going off of it will be the most enjoyable process. Lol. \n\nI'm still going to go through with it, and I'm looking forward to being off of it! But I just want to ready myself for potential discomfort and get a better feeling for what I should *really* expect, from the best-case scenario to the worst-case scenario.\n\nI'll poke around here for similar questions/answers, as well. \n\nThank you in advance!\n\nPS Just to be extra clear, I'm seeking *personal* experiences and insight, NOT medical advice.

They lived there for 4 years and were not happy so they moved back home. My husband and I bought them a house to move into together , which took a few months to get ready, During that time my sons would fight all the time and I suspected they both were taking drugs. My middle son would feed me info saying his little brother is doing drugs. I would ask if he knew for sure and he would say no but just look at him its obvious.\n\nWhen their house was finally ready for them to move in together , my younger son came to my husband and I and told us he cant move in with his brother. It was very difficult for him but he told us that his brother got him addicted to Oxy when they were living in Cali. He said the reason they fought so much was because they are both addicts and he cant stand how awful they treated each other and how bad he feels being on it. He said in order to get clean he has to cut his brother out of his life completely until he gets clean .\n\nMy husband and I first told our older son that his brother won't move in with him because he is addicted to oxy and needs to get clean. We told our older son how proud we are of his younger brother for coming to us for help. We thought maybe that would get him to come clean to us with his addiction, as well. He did not. All he said was \"oh , he could have come to me and I would have understood and could have helped him.\" He has been living in the house by himself for a couple weeks and my husband and I went to talk to him and told him we know everything. That he got his brother started on oxy and we know he takes 400mg a day (prob higher now). Of course he denied everything . We told him until he can be honest with us and get clean we will not continue to give him money .\n\nIt's been a couple weeks now and I haven't seen or spoken to him, except for a couple necessary texts about a delivery or something. I don't know if I should reach out to him or go over and talk to him again.¬†**My last text was telling him we love him and this is all we can do until he gets clean . That we are here for him when he is ready to be honest. My question is do we not reach out to him or should keep trying? Should we go back over to talk to him or reach out in some way?**\n\nI forgot to add that his psychiatrist prescribes 4mg of klonopin a day and 45 2mg xanax every month. He also gets extremely mean and treats the people he loves like shit. I really thought when his little brother cut him out of his life that would get him to wake up! They were extremely close. Any suggestions I greatly appreciate , I'm at my wits end!\n\nThanks in advance for any help!",

Before my opiate habit I was prescribed adderall and it was a lifesaver.  Kept me organized and focused blah blah. \n\nNow that I'm trying to clean my act uo I talked to my doctor and he recommended a low 30mg dose of Vyvanse, which is a long acting amphetamine with less potential for abuse than say adderall or Desoxyn (which if you're not familiar with is PHARMACEUTICAL GRADE METHamphetamine typically prescribed to the morbidly obese or severe narcoleptics). I will tell you from personal experience that if you think adderall makes you focused, with desoxyn you'll build a fucking house all by yourself.  But I digress...\n\nThe bottom line is this, adderall, vyvanse, desoxyn, dynavel, ALL of them are some form of amphetamine, dextroamphetamine or methamphetamine. I have no desire to see my old speed plug.  But sometimes I think \"I'm taking fucking speed (prescribed from the doctor) anyway.  What am I accomplishing here?\" \n\nI'm sorry for these esoteric and philosophical questions, but the whole recovery business is SO FUCKED UP, I don't know who to believe half the time.  Is the vyvanse killing brain cells and destroying my liver just like crystal meth? I mean methamphetamine metabolizes into amphetamine after a few days anyway.  \n\nOut of EVERY drug I've done, I still maintain my longest and worst withdrawals were from subs which were medically prescribed. \n\nI guess there is no real question here, but it's really amazing how they can label methamphetamine \"Desoxyn\" and give it to u at rite aid.",

Went through a similar cycle from 2017-2020 but that first cycle was the first time I tried suboxone and it felt like a miracle drug at the time. Have worked a corporate job during these past 7 years and even got multiple promotions, now lead a team of 10 and earn close to $1 million a year. I am not trying to brag because of course my addict self doesn‚Äôt care about any of this, it only cares about using. Instead I am trying to provide some context around why I have struggled so hard to beat this. While it is def effing up my life and beginning to severely affect work, I keep thinking I can use just one more time, one more week, one more month etc. I use subs every time I try to quit, last 2 days sometimes up to a week on subs, yet will go right back to using a day or two after my last sub. The high isn‚Äôt as great yet I‚Äôm still compelled to use. I almost feel like blues are an abusive boyfriend that I know deep down doesn‚Äôt love me yet I am mentally and emotionally dependent on them. \n\nI am debating going on sublocade as I‚Äôm afraid of still using on it despite the fact that it blocks opiates given my history with suboxone. I have also debated trying ibogaine treatment but it‚Äôs hard to get time away from my office job and I would need to be off suboxone for 28 days at least beforehand. Right now I have a pattern of 1-7 days of suboxone, 1-2 weeks of blues, 1-7 days of suboxone and repeat.  \n\nAny advice for me would be really appreciated. I just don‚Äôt know why I have tried a hundred times and every time I have a voice in the back of my mind trying to negotiate a way to still use. ",

    "selftext": "Will try to make this as short as possible, I‚Äôm sorry.\nI have been messing around recreationally with opiates since age 14. From the very first time I took a Loritab, I was in love. But always did them like here and there, maybe once or twice a month.\nThen in Oct 2021 started getting dirty 30s not knowing they were fake and fent pressed. My dumb ass. In Jan 2022, my fianc√© found me ODed on the kitchen floor, administered Narcan and CPR, and brought me back. But I was just like ‚Äúoh I did too many, I won‚Äôt do that again.‚Äù And kept using them.\nCut to Oct 2022 and I finally realize the pills are fake pressed fent pills. I got scared as fuck. I‚Äôm like oh fuck no no no I‚Äôm not taking these anymore. Flushed my supply down the toilet and vowed never again‚Ä¶.. until I got dope sick. I had to work and like be ‚Äúnormal‚Äù so I had to get more. Finally end of Oct 2022, I came clean to my family and even my work and was able to get time off and financial support to go through WD and get clean. Nov 6, 2022 was the last day I used. \nAs you probably all know, WD was fucking hell. Physically feeling like my body was being ripped in half, mental fucking agony, and no sleep for 23 days straight. Every time I‚Äôd finally fall asleep, I‚Äôd JOLTTTT awake feeling RLS symptoms, except in my back and arms‚Ä¶ not in my legs. Hallucinating on day 3. All of it. Was really fucking bad.\n\nThen on my one month sober day, Dec 6, 2022, went to the grocery store to make a nice dinner for my fianc√© and I to celebrate my success. Came home from grocery store to find him on the floor struggling to breathe. Roll him on his back and a bottle of dirty 30s fall out of his hand. Gave him Narcan and CPR. Right as the ambulance rolled up outside, I heard ‚Äúthe death rattle‚Äù sound and they couldn‚Äôt bring him back. He died in my arms. My soulmate. I never even knew he was using them, he somehow kept it hidden. Probably because I was usually too high to notice that he was too. Idk.\n\nCut to today. Somehow have landed myself back where I was. It happened so fast. I used maybe 4 of the dirty 30s a day for like less than a month and then when I ran out‚Ä¶ the WDs started.\n\nI‚Äôm so fucking ashamed of myself I can‚Äôt bring myself to tell anyone. Not only because of the shame that comes with addiction, but these things killed the person I love most in the world‚Ä¶ how could I even think about going back?\n\nCall me a baby, but I cannot fucking do the WD again. I can‚Äôt. I would actually 100% rather die. Especially hearing that they get worse every time you relapse. I can‚Äôt imagine something worse than last time and I don‚Äôt want to.\nLuckily, I‚Äôm not working right now and won‚Äôt be for a few months. Have to get a pretty invasive surgery soon and waiting until after I‚Äôm recovered from that to work again. I know I‚Äôll get prescribed opiates for the surgery, so I‚Äôm trying to taper down to as little of the dirty 30s as tolerable until I can get REAL pills and then hopefully taper off of those. But also don‚Äôt want to rely on that bc sometimes my supplier runs out of stock, and then I‚Äôm fucked.\n\nI don‚Äôt want to live this hell anymore. Nobody deserves to be a slave to a substance. Even tapering down is agony and hard af to do bc obviously being an addict I don‚Äôt have a thing for moderation. And tapering is hard with pills that aren‚Äôt real. Don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre getting or what dose.\n\nMy symptoms right now are just extreme anxiety all day, and the ‚Äújolts‚Äù in my arms at night that keep me awake while trying to taper.\n\nI can deal with this shit if I can just fucking sleep and make the jolts in my arms stop. PLEASE what can I take or do to make it stop at night?\n\nI have a Valium prescription for 10mg.\nI have a Clonidine prescription for 0.2mg, which everyone says helps but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs helping because I‚Äôve taken it for 3 years every night.\nI got a bottle of 90 300mg Gabapentin but my tolerance to them builds so fast they‚Äôll help one night and not the next. Like I have to skip doses for it to work. And the days I skip the dose the jolts seem to be worse.\n\nI‚Äôm also able to get 900mcg Belbucca strips, but not sure if those will send me into PWD???\n\nI‚Äôve tried a massage gun and hot baths and even a TENS unit but it only helps momentarily.\n\nI feel hopeless right now. Like there‚Äôs no point to even trying anymore. Please help me.\n",

I was suicidal, high risk, crisis were calling me every day, they put me on 300g Venlafaxine and Mirtazapine. My mum even brought a fucking priest in because I was so ill. I kept talking about ghosts or something. She begged my friends to watch me, even go so far as to offer payment for them to take time off work cause she was so frightened I was gonna kill myself. I didn‚Äôt sleep or shower for weeks, just drank wine, smoked and walked around the house all night crying. It was a bad bad bad time. \n\nSomeone gave me codeine to help my aching.

    "title": "Going to rehab clinic. Best decision of my life ‚ù§Ô∏è",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\nI wanna share the positive side of my journey in cleaning myself from opioids.\nI made a post some weeks ago while I was in withdrawal stating that I wanted to get clean.\nThat very day I called the SERT (clinic for rehab from drugs in Italy)\nThe secretary on the phone was a bit idk, it was hard to explain things on the phone, but we managed to set up an appointment for first approach.\nl asked her if I should keep using or stop by myself before the appointment. She said the best thing was to keep things stable and keep using so that the medic could decide better based on my situation.\n\nAbout using, l've been using OxyContin for about one year and a half. For the past half a year l've started injecting it into my veins.\nAt first I wasn't doing a bunch, 40-80 daily, but then it got more and more into it, and for the past months my minimum daily dose was about 420mg (A full blister, which is 12 pills, of 40mg Oxy), doing single shots of 40mg to 80mg. | could go all the way up to do 1.120mg in 24hours (a whole box of 40mg Oxy), and that wasn't uncommon at all. Maybe one day I did a blister, next | did a whole box.\nIt got even worse then my last post, where I was doing a blister a day. A whole box a day is just too much for me, I literally have a needle in me every 30mins. It has gone to the point I don't feel shit, I just do it. To be real I don't OD only because since I always have pharma Oxy, I know down to the last mg how much l'm taking, and I don't do more than 3 pills at once. But I literally feel so little since I do it so much often.\nIt has no point anymore, but I still get the withdrawals if I go one day without it. I just wanna stop. But I was too used to it.\n\nSo, clinic day arrived, and I had a meeting with the medic. She was really a kind woman, took my matter very seriously, and was really willing to help, without judging or making me feel bad.\nIn the clinic there are three supervisors to take care of you. A medic, a social worker, and a psychologist. I haven't met the last one yet, but literally everyone and the nurses as well are so kind it melts my heart.\n\nI really felt cared for in the clinic. I really felt I was getting the help I needed. I'm really positive I want to stop, and I want to do it also because those women believe in me, and I want to make those women proud.\nThe medic said she had flashbacks, cuz a 21 y/ o girl addicted to opioids IV was something not common at all in 2024 in Italy. It was more a\n'90s thing, and she is sad seeing someone my age using so much. The nurse is really nice as well, she asked how young I was and then said I was young like her nephew, and made a sad face. The social worker went to almost crying when we did a questionnaire about my clinical picture and there were questions about mental health and suicide.\nThose women are really amazing. They really wanna help you without judging at all.\nWholesome moment: I had a talk with the medic about medical profession, since that's something that always interested me but I'm not diligent enough to study medicine. She said that being a medic is like having many drawers in the brain, and for every patient you fill the drawer, and maybe take out experiences from an old one. Since l'm kinda an uncommon case in 2024, I said \"I hope with the drawer you make for me you'll be able to help someone else as well!\" And she replied \"I honestly can't wait to retire, but I won't retire until I'll make something good for you [my name]\"\n\nEverything feels so better now. I decided to go to a clinic exactly because I felt I couldn't do it alone, I needed someone to have my back, and I really found people who do so.\nAnd mind that SERT is a free state clinic. It's not a fancy clinic, you don't have to pay anything, you also get exemption from the meds and medical visits.\nEveryone can go there and everyone can get help.\n\nAnd that's the reason I wanted to write this long ass post. I felt like I couldn't do it, I felt like there was no point in stopping, I felt like people wouldn't care whether I stopped or used or even died.\nBut people do care, you just have to find those that see you as valuable and want you to get better.\nHelp is there, you just gotta reach into it.\nEveryone can. Whoever you are, whatever your age, whether you're broke or not.\nGoing to the clinic really helped me. Not only with stopping the addiction, but also with feeling good while doing so. Feeling like the bad times won't be for nothing, but someone will really care seeing me getting better.\n\nYou can recover as well, we can all recover. ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nTo this day, I did some blood tests, ECG, medical visits, etc.\nAt first I wanted to stop with just getting whatever I could take to ease the pain.\nSertralin, Xanax, whatever... but now I can stop in a much safer way. Still won't be easy, but I really feel I can do it now.\nAt the time I'm still using up to the therapy appointment, as discussed. I'm still doing too much a day, but I'll try to diminish as much as I can on my own these days.\nI will start my substitution therapy on the 6th. It will probably be methadone as we discussed that, but l'll see what the medic decides.\nI'm truly happy I can put an end to all this.\n\nYou matter too ‚ù§Ô∏è Take care of yourself ",

    "selftext": "Hi r/OpiatesRecovery Community,\n\nMy name is Bryant. About a year ago, turned to this community for help and to hear your experiences. Now, I‚Äôm back to share the results that you made possible.¬†\n\nI‚Äôve thought a lot about how I‚Äôd come back and share this study with you all, and words don‚Äôt even capture how honored I feel to have been welcomed here. Your contributions made something very special possible, so let me show you what we‚Äôve accomplished:¬†\n\nThanks to your insights, I was able to publish two papers both in the [*International Journal of Mental Health & Addiction*](https://link.springer.com/journal/11469), currently the [top-ranked peer-reviewed substance use journal globally](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=top_venues&hl=en&vq=med_addiction). It‚Äôs incredible to think that your voices and experiences have reached such a wide audience. You can view the studies here (or feel free to email me [here](mailto:Contact@BryantStonePhD.com) or on [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/385387145_Perceived_Addiction_Potential_Preliminary_Evidence_of_the_Accuracy_of_Self-Assessed_Substance_Use_Disorder_Risk?_sg%5B0%5D=EusG0BeUUN76kvohoDU1Il720PiUkQOsM8txII-SX7XxE8dc24pbRxDJzqm6OvWEVXuQJd1gCogIVf90Fqij8e_KFEtV0e4Z1dVWqUuU.Uz3xtNnOp2m3bNFIq_5dnhVFb7JLwmJ5XBnNZnzVguhI2QnIkZF9NJoXNGgnUrkVj_Jfv9VA5h1JF7KeCrZwfQ&_tp=eyJjb250ZXh0Ijp7ImZpcnN0UGFnZSI6InByb2ZpbGUiLCJwYWdlIjoicHJvZmlsZSIsInByZXZpb3VzUGFnZSI6InByb2ZpbGUiLCJwb3NpdGlvbiI6InBhZ2VDb250ZW50In19) for a PDF copy):\n\n**Paper 1:** [Perceived Addiction Potential: Preliminary Evidence of the Accuracy of Self-Assessed Substance Use Disorder Risk](https://rdcu.be/dYDyj)\n\nSummary: Do people know when they‚Äôre at risk of addiction? Most people professionals and other people assume they don‚Äôt. **My first paper flips a common assumption on its head ‚Äì turns out, people do have a sense of their addiction risk** :) I asked if people can accurately sense if they're on a risky path with substance use. Turns out, they can. People had a surprisingly accurate understanding of their own substance use disorder risk. This study challenges a lot of what professionals and even friends and family assume about substance use and addictions. It makes us rethink how we assess and talk about risk in healthcare and research. Essentially, it‚Äôs about trusting people‚Äôs awareness of their own experiences and recognizing that the discrepancies in substance use reporting (for example, people saying they drink 2 days a week when it is actually five) come from the consequences of use (such as losing access to a medication), not an unawareness on our part.\n\n**Paper 2:** [Removing stigmatizing Language in Self-Reports: Effects on Psychometric Properties & Respondent Beliefs](https://rdcu.be/dHXRE)\n\nSummary: How does language impact stigma in addiction self-assessments? In the second paper, I looked at how language affects people‚Äôs attitudes toward addiction. Have you ever filled out a substance use self-report? I have and they do not always feel very welcoming. So, what I tested is if switching out typical ‚Äúaddiction‚Äù language for less stigmatizing terms changes the way the self-report measures substance uses and if it affects our beliefs or the beliefs of people filling out these measures. I found that it does not really chance what the self-report measures; However, people‚Äôs negative biases decreased, especially in groups who weren‚Äôt familiar with substance use. So, it turns out, the way professionals word things matter a lot. **This study shows that small changes in wording can transform perceptions and reduce stigma, making the whole field more inclusive.**¬†\n\n**Materials & Data:** As promised:\n\n*I am giving the data back to you, the people, and anyone who thinks they can use it to advance our knowledge and our cause. These data are your, so dive in, explore, and share as we advance our knowledge together. If you find new insights, I‚Äôd love to hear them.*\n\nYou can find all the full study methods, materials (e.g., questionnaires), and dataset with a codebook at my [Open Science Framework](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/T6CB5) page. I believe that these data below to the people, and that I just looked through them to find patterns. So, feel free to share with others, and as you explore your data, if you find any interesting insights or new discoveries ‚Äì I‚Äôd love to hear about them.\n\n*Please* share your thoughts with me!

One route was to give yourself a dose of Narcan, and once you‚Äôre in complete precipitated withdrawal, you take the sub. It said it essentially clears your receptors and gives the subs the room to cling to them. So instead of suffering the 3-4 days you wait to take the sub and still risk being in precip for hours and hours, you send yourself into pure WDs immediately, take the sub and just suffer for the 45mins to an hour it takes the sub to kick in. \n\nHas anyone ever tried this?

I was using Oxy before then for around 5 months, then DHC(30mg) for around a year prior, and finally codeine(cold water extraction) on and off for a nearly a decade. \n\nAddiction only began somewhere around the pandemic. Prior to that I could avoid withdrawals entirely as I was only using codeine. \n\nI am now thinking of taking 2 different routes: \n\nA) Tapering off heroin \n- Slowly go from 150mg Daily to 50mg Daily over 4 weeks and then book 9 days off work to go to 0mg Daily and ride out the withdrawals. \n\nReasons for this: I avoid Addiction going on my medical records. My only concern is will power. \n\n\nB) Going onto a Subutex script with a programme provided by a doctor. I worry that this will take far longer but the added support, structure and having a professional managing it can help. However I have heard of horror stories of people being cut off suddenly and that the withdrawals from replacement therapy being worse than H, especially on methadone. \n\n\nI would really love some feedback from those, especially those relatively early in their recovery, such as those in their first 12 months. The reason being that I assume those people will be aware of the current treatments available. But also the memory of what to expect will be most fresh. \n\nAlso keen to hear from those later in their journey as I understand Detox is the easy part, recovery after Detox is where the real deep change begins. \n\nDo people find its possible to give up without NA/AA or being in a programme? \n\nAre there any common problems to look out for? \n\nFor me withdrawals are relatively mild. I just get diarrhea, running nose, cramps,;Restless legs but worse of all is the fatigue/lack of motivation. I find for me I smoke just to get things done and without one, I am so in my shell. ",

    "selftext": "Hi ya‚Äôll,\n\nSo I haven‚Äôt caught up on an update in a while, but I‚Äôm 2 and a half months clean from a daily 10 to 20 blues habit. \n\nIn December of last year, I was 3 months clean for the first time, and decided to relapse and OD‚Äôd for the first time in my life. It felt so retarded because in my 8 years of using, I‚Äôve never made the mistake of falling out. And it just seemed unfair that I was good using everyday and that my clean time was what led to my OD. \n\nFew months after that, I passed out in public while trying to get clean again. I was so sick from throwing up for 2 days straight and not eating or drinking, and I blacked out. Split my face open on the pavement. 12 stitches. \n\nTwo months after that, I got clean again (which is this time). I‚Äôm only making this post to say that this is the most stable my life has been ever. Not just stable, but I‚Äôm honestly the happiest I‚Äôve been before I even started using.\n\nI think the main problem with trying to get clean, is I could never last more than 2 weeks sober because of how cripplingly depressed I was. The brain fog, lethargy, shit sleep, depression, all of it. I couldn‚Äôt care about anything and it felt like I was stuck between continuing to be an addict and ruin my life or get clean and ruin my life because I‚Äôm so depressed. There was no middle ground for me. \n\nThe last 2 and a half months, I‚Äôve been on a Kratom regiment and just overall taking this fucking seriously. It felt like I was going to die before I ever hit 28, so nothing really mattered to me. And Kratom helped a bit in the past, but it was only to get me through days I couldn‚Äôt get high. I‚Äôm not looking at it that way anymore. \n\nFor the first time I‚Äôm feeling hopeful about the future and I can actually look people in the fucking eye. I‚Äôm also locked in on my work stuff right now and that helps a lot. It‚Äôs weird how these 2 and a half months feel like a longer clean stretch, than the 3 month time before my OD. Honestly it has less to do with time and how my mental is. I feel like back then, I was just waiting for the next relapse. Counting the days. But I really don‚Äôt want that this time. \n\nI‚Äôm only making this post in hopes that it actually helps someone. I spent years on this subreddit reading people‚Äôs success stories and feeling like it was so unrelatable, because I couldn‚Äôt see it happening for me. Just don‚Äôt give up. Even if you don‚Äôt see yourself quitting soon, don‚Äôt give up on your life. I think for so long, I was getting high dangerously because my life felt so over that it didn‚Äôt even matter if I died. But everybody can eventually get better. So just stay safe until then. \n\nLove yall man\n\n",

    "title": "Why I always tell my homies to ditch the \"addict\" label ",
    "selftext": "When a person labels themselves as an \"addict,\" it can be deeply harmful to their self-image, mental health, and ability to develop out of their addiction. This self-labeling often leads to the internalization of negative stereotypes and the perpetuation of feelings of shame and helplessness, which can sabotage the process of recovery and deepen the roots of addiction.\n\n\nThe term \"addict\" is loaded with stigma. Contrary to popular belief, using the term \"addict\" increases stigma associated with addictive disorders - the label does not decrease stigma (WHO, NIDA)\n\n\nBeing an \"addict\" is associated with a lack of control, moral failing, and societal deviance. By adopting this label, individuals may internalize these negative views - even subconsciously - which can cause a person to believe that they are permanently flawe; that addiction is all-defining or inherent to who they are, and will last forever, rather than being the temporary problem it is often found to be (for example, the average alcohol addiction lasts 15 years)\n   \n\nThis can create a cycle of shame and maladaptive coping behaviors, where people see themselves not just as humans who struggle with a very natural human issue - compulsive behavior - but as fundamentally defective in some unchangeable way. Shame can lead to feelings of worthlessness, which can lead to worsening addiction as people use substances to cope with the pain that comes from these beliefs.\n\n\nSelf-identifying as an \"addict\" often overshadows the many other positive facets of a person‚Äôs identity, such as being a parent, family member, professional, or artist. This \"addict\" label can become central to their self-concept, which can make it hard for them to see their own strengths, talents, and positive qualities.\n\n\nRecovery is a process of growth and development that is helped along when a person cultivates a sense of self that goes beyond their addiction. When someone identifies first, foremost, and forever as an \"addict,\" it can prevent them from exploring new roles, hobbies, and relationships, which are essential for growth and healing.\n\n\n Labels like \"addict\" can create a perception that addiction is a permanent and fixed part of one's identity. In psychology, this is referred to as a \"fixed mindset,\" where individuals believe their traits or behaviors are unchangeable. A \"fixed\" mindset is associated with lower overall performance and achievement, reduced resilience, avoidance of challenges, and increased anxiety.\n  \n\nA fixed mindset can be a barrier to developing beyond an addiction because it implies that change is unlikely or even impossible. In contrast, cultivating a \"growth mindset\" encourages people to view addiction as something they can overcome, allowing them to focus on building a positive identity, new habits, and healthier coping strategies, rather than being forced to \"accept\" a label that carries the weight of a perceived lifelong disability.\n\n\nNegative labels associated with addiction like \"addict\" often bring about a sense of hopelessness, which can lead to and/or exacerbate depression, anxiety, and other mental health struggles. Believing that they are \"just an addict\" can make people feel they‚Äôre not worthy of the many positive things in life. Internalization of the negative label can lead to subconscious - or conscious - self-sabotage.\n\n\nLow self-esteem and negative self-perception can also make bouncing back from an addiction more difficult, as individuals may feel that they are undeserving of a better life or incapable of achieving one.\n\n\nWhen someone labels themselves as an \"addict,\" it can reinforce feelings of helplessness. They may start to earnestly believe that they lack control over their behavior, which weakens motivation to engage in recovery efforts and takes away from their overall sense of \"agency\", which is an important psychological concept related to an individual's ability to make personal decisions that affect change in their lives. It can also lead to \"learned helplessness\", which is an often-documented consequence of both depression and addiction in which a person believes they are unable to control a situation even when they have the opportunity to do so.\n \n\n In contrast, a person who conceptualizes themselves as being an ‚Äúaddiction survivor‚Äù or something similar is in a position to feel that they are active agents in their journey. This is a more positive self-concept, which encourages resilience, self-compassion, agency, and motivation, which are all essential for lasting recovery.\n\n\n tl;dr the \"addict\" label, when internalized, sabotages recovery, decreases motivation, increases stigma, increases shame, overshadows positive identity traits, prevents exploration of new roles, leads to a \"fixed\" mindset, reduces self-esteem, reduces psychological agency, worsens mental health, and can cause learned helplessness, among other negative things. A postive self-concept is crucial for success in developing beyond an addiction.\n",

This time is different, but I really want it to mean something this time. THIS TINE IS DIEFFERENT!!!!\nI am 19 hours from my last dose of 5/325 oxy/Tylenol. I am feeling it but I put on a 5mcg butrans patch and will wear it for the 7 days then not put another on. I'm not going to lie.  It's rough right now but I am hoping the butrans starts working sometime tonight.  \nTo all the fellow warriors going the the battle, keep you head up. This is a short-term feeling in the battle we call life. I hope you can muster the will to keep fighting ",

If you study the pharmacology of bupenorphine it has been touted as an anti depressant because of how it activates receptors.

New leaves sprouting, and new branches that will hopefully take me in a new direction.

    "selftext": "Hello,\n\nI started taking kratom about 10-12 days into withdrawal from 1.5 year codeine/ethylmorphine withdrawal, followed by a few weeks of massive dose poppy seed tea withdrawals and fake oxy from the dark web in 2017.\n\nI didn't know what kratom was but when it took away my post acute withdrawal symptoms from just buying a drink at a bar, I was amazed but quickly began using it every day.\n\nAbout 2 years later though I got very depressed after the 2 most productive years of my life where I began to chase my dreams and truly build who I wanted to be, and decided to try something slightly stronger: poppy seed tea.\n\nI learned to not make massive batches but just about 100-250g in a shaker bottle shaken for 4 minutes washed twice. \n\nThat became the norm for me for the past several years. At first i still had kratom as well, going to the bar, but I was trying not to get too fucked up.\n\nPrior to the codeine addiction I had a year clean after the first 4 yesrs of my adulthood were spent in and out of the predatory rehab system. I went from a kid sent by worried parents for experimenting with hallucinogenic  and smoking a lot of weed, to shooting heroin and coke until I was sure all i was was a drug addict destined to die as I watched all my friends die around me\n\nI overdosed and that gave me the resolve to stop. I got clean at a fantastic rehab which taught me to function in society, it didn't just lock me down, but because they were not scamming insurance and cycling clients through over and over to run their insurance like all the places shut down by the FBI in 2017-19 (which i was a victim of from 2012-2016 even was a witness who received a payout at a federal court case because of one of the places) their inpatient program went out of business. But they really changed my life and taught me to be my own man with my own goals and lose the idea of being just an addict. I was jacked, attractive, confident, focused on my mental health, working, handling my ADHD without medication, going back to school, it was amazing.\n\nBut after a year I tried smoking weed and ADHD medication. I didn't stick to the meds they didn't work like before but I got into smoking weed for a while as I left. But my mentality changed from total abstinence to just no hard drugs.\n\nBut then I went to Europe and got on codeine which was cheap and over the counter. \n\nAnyway, like I said I was on PST for years. \n\nKratom would not stop the withdrawals during the periods where I was put of seeds and waiting on a new shipment, it just barely helped. I knew I could not stop but I thought it was like suboxone for me.\n\nHowever now in 2024 I started making a lot more money than ever before and went with my girlfriend to Europe for a very fancy trip, and of course, thought I could handle relapsing on morphine which was easy to find on the streets of Paris.\n\nHowever I bought a fuckton and brought it home with me. I also used my new found money to start buying drugs on the dark web. \n\nWhen I would run out and shipments took a long time I would get super depressed and lethargic and turned to things like gambling very badly and lost tens of thousands of dollars, maybe even hundreds. I would take poppy tea and it helped but didn't stop the withdrawals entirely. \n\nSo I have been using and I finally came clean to my family. \n\n\nI am just on oxy now for about a week, no poppy tea. I have a good amount left and have been cutting from 200-300mg/day to 140mg yesterday, today planning to do 100mg, and so on.\n\nI want to not get back on PST, I fear the withdrawal from the extra alkaloids, so I wonder if I can taper down from just oxy without crossing back over. \n\nMaybe i could use PST as a buffer for a day or 2 but I don't know if that will retrigger full PST withdrawal so maybe best to avoid it.\n\nI also have 2 boxes of suboxone strips. I have carried a few in my wallet for years in case of an emergency where I am separated from seeds for too long. That's crazy, right? I tried them once and timed it wrong and went into DEEP precipitated withdrawals, which for me just look like extreme lethargy, temperature disregulation, and outrageous discomfort. However with the PST unless I drank it in the morning AND before bed I would feel withdrawals every morning. \n\nAt different points the tea has had different strengths. It got very weak 2 years ago and then suddenly very strong, but then that company went out of business and i only have about 10lb left. I have a couple hundred pounds of different companies I have bought from over the years that many are worthless, some are OK, anyway whatever.\n\nThe point is I had stopped using the pills many times, this is probably the 4th or 5th wave. I bought last in August and used oxy for a month straight at massive doses, more than 12,000mg in less than 31 days before shifting back to PST. Same in June, used for a month, ran out, switched to tea. \n\nThis time my family and girlfriend (who just kicked me out before knowing I had relapsed on hard drugs, idk how she didn't figure it out, she even saw me use them for a month straight when I broke my foot in May and told her I bought them to sell to a friend and would stop, and she believed me somehow. She has confirmed that she wasn't just pretending not to notice either, it really hit her. She was a MASSIVE One Directioner so finding out the week Liam died has taken a huge toll on her) know I relapsed on this stuff. My family supported the seeds because in their eyes I was successful and they kept me from using heroin or pills or whatever and seemed mostly normal. My girlfriend always wanted me to stop but just was never super vocal about it.\n\nNow I know with a separation/potential break up, which I tried using more to avoid the pain from but really it just amplified my emotions and insecurities and thousand fold, I have an excuse to say \"oh I gave up trying to quit because she left me\" or something like that.\n\nIt may also seem like I'm just trying to quit to save the relationship after 5 years of using daily, with her every time I mentioned getting clean voicing STRONG desire for me to. \n\nI can't worry about those things right now. \n\n\nWhat I need to know is, is there a way for me to just taper down from the oxy? Honestly today I've only taken 40mg after a full week of 200-300mg days, and I feel fine\n\nI took about 140mg yesterday throughout the day, woke up twice, at 1am and again at 3am withdrawing slightly and took 20mg each time. \n\nWoke up withdrawing at 730am and took 20mg, then another 20mg within an hour. \n\n\nNow I don't feel I need the next one at 10am on the dot.\n\n\nSo what can I do. Will I end up skipping over the many alkaloid withdrawal of poppy seed tea by just using the oxy as my final taper? \n\nI literally have enough to spread out a taper over a month or 2, maybe 3.\n\nSo would decreasing in dosage daily until I'm at let's say 5mg twice a day, then 5mg once a day, then maybe some kratom for support work?\n\n\nCan someone help me outline a plan, coming from 7 years PST to 6 months on and off oxycodone use, to now 200-300mg/day for a week, decreasing down to nothing? Not going back on the tea, maybe for a day or two at some point in between, maybe switching to suboxone, maybe to kratom? I dont really fucking know what to do. ",

The fent almost certainly contains SOME other stuff but we don‚Äôt seem as far down the tranq rabbit hole here as some places.\n\nHe had to be narcanned with 3 doses the other day and he really wants to quit.\n\nHe has a lot of gabapentin, suboxone strips, access to a decent quantity of methadone, and some prescribed oxy 30s. and I have Ativan I will give him. He probably can't ask the doctor for anything else.\n\nHe has access to real heroin too, although he's not a regular user. Although after he was narcanned they gave him a ton and he didn't even feel it. (I know, the Narcan sticks to your opiate receptors so that might not mean anything.)\n\nHe also uses meth so has that too. If that‚Äôs helpful for any reason. He doesn‚Äôt seem to have trouble with the meth. Like he kinda smokes it like others smoke a bowl of weed. But he doesn‚Äôt take more and more and stay up for days.\n\nHe‚Äôs cool as hell but not very educated about this stuff. Like he didn‚Äôt even know about suboxone causing PWD. So I‚Äôm nervous giving him a super complicated set of instructions. I don't know how the Bernese method even works for fent but I don't know if that's too much?\n\nI think his best bet is to go straight to methadone. But I have no idea how long it is before one becomes dependent on methadone.\n\nHe‚Äôs probably only been using fent maybe 1-2 years. And not in a serious habitual daily way for that whole time.\n\nHe knows this will be unpleasant. And he has the all too common problem of having lots of people in his life that use. But I think that‚Äôs step 2. Step 1 is detox.\n\nAny advice is appreciated. Thanks!",

    "title": "I need help. Badly",
    "selftext": "Hello \n\nHello I am 30 years old and for the past 7 or 8 years. I have been on here cradum, or poppy seeds. At an extremely low-dose, as essentially maintenance, when I was 18 to 21I was stuck in the disgusting human trafficking patient brokering rehab system. That was not interested in helping people, but just cycling them through the program and turning them into shells of human beings over and over, so that they could charge their insurance\n\nHowever, about 6 months ago I went to France, a place where I used to use a lot of opiates, particularly coding and morphine and thinking I could handle it while just on vacation I bought morphine from a street dealer, but now, compared to when I was 22 and 23I make a lot. Of money? So I bought a shit ton of morphine and brought it home with me when it ran out, I started buying oxycodone on the dark web. When that would run out, I would switch to poppy CT because it came in the mail and would take a long time to arrive sometime so I would have to go through withdrawal, so I had so many opportunities to stop and end it. But I've never had money and been in this level of active, hard drug addiction before, so every single time that I would run out, I would try and be on just cratum or just tea for a few days or a few weeks and then feel really depressed because I'm still essentially going through. Withdrawal, and this is no longer signal. Fixing the problem of withdrawal and no longer being a maintenance drug, it's essentially a tenth, the strength of that of what I was sniffing every single day\n\nSo I would buy more. I have the resources. I can afford to obviously every time II had to go to rehab as a kid. I was using it, financial aid and scholarship. Money are borrowing twenty dollars from family members or at worst stealing twenty forty fifty a hundred dollars.I was never using thousands and thousands of dollars of drugs.I realized I have spent more than forty thousand dollars on drugs in the past six or eight months\n\nSo basically, because of my bad experiences with detox in the past and rehabbed and my trauma with that not working, I don't want to go into a traditional detox. I have tried using suboxone before to get off poppy seeds. However, the suboxone ended up being much, much stronger than the poppy seeds and actually getting me really fucked up, so I realized, okay, this isn't going to work right? Because the poppy seeds, while still being addictive and affecting my endorphin system greatly and making me go into horrible withdrawal, when I stop are nowhere near as strong as the drug suboxone, helps treat addiction of\n\nBut to be fair now, I'm using oxy. More than 200 mg a day. Honestly, I'm snorting it and I know that's not the most bio available, but I just really love the process. I'm addicted to it much like I used to be addicted 22 the feeling of shooting up and the process of shooting up almost as much as the actual drugs I was shooting\n\nHow I manage to get clean at 21 after being positive. That all? I was was a worthless addict, not a brilliant kid who was top of his class in high school, earned a full ride scholarship and was going to go to med school and was in the honors college, which gave him guaranteed acceptance. No I had been convinced by the. Rehab industry Who forced me to miss every enrollment date? So that I lost my scholarships because I could have gone to rehab for let's say 30 days and then gone to the next semester of school, but they would keep me there for 45 days so that they could send me to the halfway house they wanted me to go to and at that halfway house. People were using, and then when I would use, I would be forced to go back into detox and then the same rehab again, and then cycle through it again, so I ended up losing my scholarship, and yes, this is purposeful, I understand my own use was partially to blame. But I didn't have a purpose. My purpose became being drug addicts in rehab and then when I couldn't go to school, I would sit around board as an adult all I had ever known was being a super overachiever in high school. So taking away that purpose left me empty and then of course I would use and I first went to rehab, because my parents were concerned about my marijuana use and experimenting with things like ecstasy and psychedelics, and there I got introduced to opiates, and not even heroin, yeah. It was only after my first adult rehab, and my first adult halfway house that I even knew where to get heroin.I learned it there.I tried it and only a week after that did I.Decide to start shooting up.And that obviously ruined my life\n\nHow I got clean?Was there was one rehab that was not like the rest?It was not full of a bunch of losers from the northeast that had given up on life.Just like me to be clear, I was one of those losers, I became one of them, they convinced me that I was worthless and nothing more than an addict\n\nBut this place did not tolerate people that were just using their insurance to jump from rehab to rehab.Used for a little bit and move on.In fact, those people were such professional rehabbers that there were evil marketers who would pay them to use in between rehabs and then move them around and the marketer would get paid off their insurance and the people jumping from rehab to rehab would agree to it.They were in on the grift\n\nSo anyway, this one rehab that was focused on real psychological psychiatric and philosophical peer reviewed data on how to treat addiction and focus on actually teaching individuals how to live in the real world and gave them a lot of freedom that place did not tolerate those rehab hoppers\n\nI had gone there once, but I was full rehab. Hopper, so I was kicked out within 2 weeks, but then I overdosed at my mother's house. Thankfully I realized it was happening and managed to make it to her room. I woke up in the ambulance and I just was done I was finished. I didn't want to use any more. I didn't want to die. I didn't want to be an addict. And that honestly probably could have gotten out of my head even though I had ptsd from the overdose and still do, but I was sent to this place and this place was good\n\nThey kept me inpatient for 5 months even as I went back to school and got a job. I learned how to rebuild my life. I got extremely healthy.I learned meditation and how to be okay with myself.I fell in love for the first time with a regular girl.We broke up after six months and two of my roommates died at the same exact time, because fentanyl had just hit my city. And these two guys happened to relapse around the same time, and both of them died within what I would imagine was a week or so of using.\n\nAnyway, I was able to keep that up for over a year but, then I went to Europe to backpack, because my cousin called me when I was in the worst of dealing with that breakup and those 2 deaths. By the way, I found one of the people dead in my house.But anyway, he called me and said, hey I want to go back pack europe and I want to do it with you, and at that moment, I was more willing and more open to do that than any other moment in time, so we agreed\n\nI couldn't do drugs, so I buried myself in trying to sleep with as many women and even some men as possible for the next few months and then I realized oh I need money to go to Europe. So I buried myself in work. I got 2 jobs at very high-end restaurants and hotels, and I was working 6 and a 1/2 days a week. I couldn't even really go home.I ended up meeting a girl that lived closer to the jobs then my own house and I asked her, hey be my girlfriend for the next eight weeks while I do these jobs and I'll sleep at your house and then I leave to europe and we break up\n\nHe didn't break up. I ended up telling her to meet me in Europe. After I spent 6 weeks there, she came out and a friend of mine called me while I was out there and said, Hey, can you go to the pharmacy and check if they have this medication? I'll pay you a bunch of money to send it to the United States. I, it's just hard to get here. I assumed it was some sort of lifesaving medication, because of the universal healthcare in europe.Nope it was codeine\n\nI ended up relapsing on coding.That was two euros for huge bottles or huge boxes of pills, and we ended up staying in europe for eighteen months surviving off of shipping it into the u.S and my friend selling it he even was selling it to rappers it's actually kind of funny but that's a story for another time\n\nAfter 18 months, though it was time to come home, we brought enough coding for honestly a couple weeks but it ended up running out when it started running out. I tried buying drugs on the dark web and they ended up being fake, but we use them anyway, but eventually our families figured out what we were doing and me and the girlfriend were forced to go into detox. That was the last time I went to a detox, but I guess because I had never really used for 18 months. I had never gone through anything this bad. After 7 days of suboxone, weaning, I was still in terrible withdrawals. The physical symptoms were pretty much over but my body just wouldn't function. My mind was essentially dead, I had no motivation. I would just lay in bed all day and watch YouTube videos and scroll through my phone, because it was the only thing that gave me a little bit of dopamine, you know. And I don't know it was awful\n\nA friend of mine saw the slump I was in and I asked me to move in with him and said, Hey, you need to get out of the house. Come with me to this bar, I know you're getting sober. They don't serve alcohol. I'm going there for a video game tournament, right? They sell these t's there. I will buy you a tea. I took that tea that he bought me and suddenly I felt okay.I realized this was kratom.\n\nI ended up using kratham everyday for the next several years and it changed who I was.It made me feel more motivated and to be honest with you.I thought my life was great because I was accomplishing all these things that I had always wanted to do but never did. \n\nHowever, my relationship ended up getting pretty bad and we were never in love any way. It was just a relationship of convenience but now we were sort of stuck with each other so I got really depressed. I remembered you could buy poppy seeds and make tea with them, and that was an opiate.I didn't want something much stronger than crowd him.I didn't want fentanyl.I didn't want pills.I just wanted something mild that would do a kratom had been doing for me for the past two or three years, so I bought the poppy seeds and I made the tea, I figured out after a while that just using a little bit essentially did for me what kratom used to.\n\n\nSo essentially, for the last seven years, i've been using poppy tea everyday, but six months ago, when my new girlfriend, who i've now been with 45 years and I went to europe, I relapse, on morphine, like I said, I followed it up with buying oxycodone.From the dark web and now we're separating I can't deal with it and i've been using like I want to die\n\nShe hadn't figured it out somehow, and I finally just told her, and that was the last step to push the separation into a breakup, which is what I was trying to avoid this whole time\n\nI don't want to get into the details too much, but I cannot handle this breakup. This girl actually is the love of my life and I know if we break up. There is no getting back together. I will not be able to handle the pain of her being single and out there and doing whatever she's going to do. She just told me today, go to treatment. Get better get off everything, including poppy seeds and call me in 3 or 4 months and we'll see if we can get back to being the couple we once were and rediscover the love we once had. I wish that could happen right? But I have a strong boundary about cheating, and I know it wouldn't be cheating because we wouldn't be together. But essentially, she's asking me to make a commitment to get better and still want her and I can't do that. I can't do both. I'm using like I want to die because I gave my everything to this relationship at 30 years old. I know is not that old but I cannot rebuild my life again.And I know it's weakness to go back to hard drugs after so long off them\n\nBut that's just what I did. I thought it would make the paint worse. To be honest with you, it's just made my emotions a 1000 times stronger. It's made me unbearable. It's made me so anxious in a way. I never have been before about all the issues around this breakup. It's made me a monster. It has taken the worst qualities of me. And amplified them a hundredfold, I want to get off these drug\n\nBut I am terrified of the depression that comes next. I now have something of a job. I have a lot of responsibilities. I owe a lot of money for business loans, business credit cards. I have businesses and I have other people that rely on me for income and to be able to pay business loans. I have opened several businesses. I fear if I go away for a month. Or even if I just do a 1 to 2 week detox and then try to come home. I will know my brain will be f***** u* I'll still be in withdrawal. I'll be in that depressive state. I won't be able to work and all of these financial problems. We'll stack on top.Of course, the emotional problems, the romantic problems, and what the f*** am I going to do with my life?Why do I even want to live existential problems\n\nI'm sorry for typos. I've been using Text-to-speech to try to explain all this and honestly, this is my fourth time doing it. It's the drugs I am on making me talk way too much. They are taking the worst part of me, which has always been being hyperverbal and accelerating at times a 1000I want to get off But I can't handle all these problems at once. I don't think I'm going to kill myself. But I'm kind of hoping that I can use to a level where I die but I know that I also don't want to die. I know that when I'm \"normal\", as in the person I've been for the last 8 years, I'm very focused on my health. I'm very focused on longevity. I'm very, very interested in things like radical life extension. I know that death is an existential terror for me and I overdosed, and that is what created them. This obsession sweet, so when I have feelings of being suicidal, I intellectually understand no, i'm not.I already overdosed, once I faced death, and that was enough of a trauma to shake me out of the belief that I was a worthless addict, that was going to die and it didn't matter\n\n\nSo I have all these problems and to be fair, if I get clean, I can probably figure them all out, but I'm terrified of what comes on the other end, the depression, the fallout I honestly hoped I could just use cradm or poppy seeds until I died, I was really hoping and believing. I mean, I really believed because I became successful only after I started using cratum, but also prior to using kratham, I had one year essentially today. Learning how to be a person? Then a year and a 1/2 backpacking and traveling Europe, so the only time that I've really been an adult in the working public has been on kratham, so maybe I'm just lying to myself, maybe I'm already capable of the levels of success and business acumen and work. Ethic that I have had today And it's just that I was exposed to that aspect of life while also happening to beyond kratham, but and what if the depression is too much, what if I can never be the successful again I have yes a mortgage? I have employees. I have business loans. I took huge risks this year financially in terms of growing my business and they've slowly been paying off, but I still need to do a lot more work and there's nobody that can do the work that I'm doing and there's nobody that can afford it. To cover the losses, if I'm not able to make all these payments for 12 or 3 months too many people are relying on me. I. Also, have been supporting my mother. She cannot support herself right now. Financially I know that for a fact she didn't save enough for retirement. Yeah, so I have been giving her money because i've become successful\n\nToo many things, too many things, too many things. I don't know what the f*** to do. I think, okay let's go to detox. Let's get clean and then yeah, let's see if this relationship is still worth salvaging. Let's see if my businesses are still worth it. Let's see if I can go back and still make money at this same level. But then I think no, your brain is messed up. You need opiates to function even if it's just at a low level, even if it's just poppies, even if it's just crabdom, but then I come back to well the relationship wont-work and to be honest with you, any relationship you get in won't. Work, because eventually they'll realize you're addicted to poppies or crat them. And it'll just be the same thing again\n\nI'm really f***** u* and messed up and like what am I gonna do? Have a zoom call with a therapist who doesn't know me for an hour. No I need help. I need to help figuring out how to prioritize. This is there anyone else here right now? Who has faced something like this? Their entire life falling apart around them and not having the motivation 2 rebuild it all from the ground up, not believing you're strong enough to do it all from the ground up, really, just wanting to give up. II don't know what to do. I'm desperate, but at the same time I don't want to go into detox. I don't want a detox at home. I just wish I could stay in that state of Having been on maintenance, poppy seeds or maintenance crabs that I was able to do for collectively, seven or eight years\n",

    "title": "32 Days Cold Turkey Off Methadone",
    "selftext": "I‚Äôll begin by saying I was a heavy fentanyl user for about a year. After I quickly hit rock bottom, I decided to quit the fentanyl and stick to methadone(I was taking both at the time and was on 90mgs). I went three days in withdrawal from the fentanyl which was crazy because I drank 2 120mg bottles and it barely made a dent but made it good enough to where I wasn‚Äôt shitting myself. I spent the next 5 days at the crisis center where they made my withdrawals a lot easier. They gave me Valium and Trazedone to sleep. Within 10 days, I had kicked the fentanyl. \nFast forward two years. I‚Äôve slightly weaned myself down from the methadone from 90mgs to 65mgs. I was doing so well that I was getting monthly take-homes. I‚Äôve been wanting to stop it mostly because my constipation was so bad and I was tired of being attached to this substance. I just needed a reason I suppose. \nWell that reason came when I switched insurances. The clinic I went to told me that building(which was closest to me)didn‚Äôt take that insurance but their other building in the city does. I was very upset but I had no choice but to drive 45 minutes to the other building. I went for about 3 weeks. I was switching jobs and on my way to my first day at work, a fucking cop t-bones my car and totals it. Luckily I walked away but now I have NO car to get to the clinic. \nSo I decided to cold turkey, and I could have borrowed my girls car but I was done at this point. The first 3 days were pretty simple. I remember telling my girlfriend that I thought something was wrong because it had been 3 days and I was only slightly feeling it. Day 4 I really started to feel it. The aches in the legs, restlessness, cold sweats and that was the first night I had insomnia. Day 5, I could barely walk. I had no energy yet couldn‚Äôt sit still. Day 6 and 7 were the worst. I could barely get out of bed and even just flipping over in bed seemed like such a chore. Day 8 is when I started to feel a little better. I was able to get out of bed and move around but I still was in heavy withdrawal. Day 9 was about the same but for some reason on day 10 it was bad again. After the first 10 days, I noticed it getting a little better every day but it would come and go in waves. There are days where I feel like I‚Äôm fine again, then the next, Id be laid up in bed with that skin-crawl feeling all over my body. There‚Äôs times where I felt like I was going backwards. \nSo, the first 2 weeks were pretty hard but since then, it‚Äôs just been lingering. I surprisingly feel okay today for the most part, 32 days in. I bought some Imodium for the diarrhea and Benadryl to help me sleep and it‚Äôs working so far. So that‚Äôs my short story of my quest to get clean.\n\nIf anyone has been through methadone withdrawal, can you share how your withdrawals were and maybe give me a guess to when I‚Äôll feel back to normal?",

    "selftext": "I keep trying to post this and it keeps getting removed.  A popular subreddit devoted to quitting kratom banned me outright. Another pulls my posts the moment I put them up. \n\nWhy try again? Because it‚Äôs downright wrong to sit back with this knowledge while people suffer through withdrawals or put off quitting for fear of withdrawal symptoms. \n\nI used Kratom for the first time around 2008 and have had experience with more conventional substances with similar effects reaching back at least a decade earlier. l've been around the block and l've gone through withdrawal more times than I care to admit.\n\nI have a method to quit kratom that produces no withdrawal FOR ME. l've used this method to not only quit kratom but also some of the more \"serious\" substances. For this however the most efficacious, safest,  and comfortable route is to step down to Kratom first, establish a dosing schedule and get a comfortable routine and then continue with the method I have outlined below.\n\nI am not recommending this to anyone. I'm simply saying this is what l've done and that l've used this to quit kratom a number of times without withdrawal symptoms. And while I am not recommending it to anyone, it has worked for me and I would be remiss to not at least outline it here for people to make their own judgement call. Withdrawals suck and it almost feels morally wrong to sit on a method that has allowed me to quit kratom a half dozen or so times without suffering and to not share.\n\nMy typical dosing schedule is 8-10 grams of kratom in the morning and 8-10 in the afternoon. The last time used this method I had been dosing at about that amount for around 6 months. \n\nOnce my kratom dosing schedule is routine, I crush a 50mg tablet of naltrexone and it to a liter of water. At this dilution 1ml of solution contains 50 MICROgrams of naltrexone.\n\nNOTE: I continue my same kratom dosing schedule all the way through this ‚Äútreatment‚Äù. \n\n1. I take my afternoon dose of kratom 6-8 hours before bed. \n2. At bedtime I take 0.5ml of my naltrexone solution (25mcg) immediately before closing my eyes. Occasionally this causes a restless night but it is entirely manageable and it is only this very first night I experience anything approaching what one would call a withdrawal symptom. \n3. The next morning and afternoon I take my normal Kratom doses. \n4. The next evening I take a full 1ml (50mcg) of my naltrexone solution before bed. I sleep like a baby.\n5. I continue my normal daily Kratom dosing for the next two weeks, but every evening I take a bit more naltrexone. Generally I double it, but if it causes any restlessness I will slow down for the next couple of days, adding instead another 50% or so.\n6. I continue this until l'm taking about 5mg of naltrexone a night, at which point I no longer receive a buzz from the Kratom and have successfuly circumvented withdrawals. Generally by this point there is no more craving. If there is it is entirely psychological.\n\nRegarding the psychological component - it's important for me that during the course of all this that I start doing some exercise during the day. It needn't be especially intensive but I believe the endorphins I get from the exercise replaced the kratom buzz in a way and thus l'm not stuck thinking about the kratom.\n\nA note on naltrexone and to get a step ahead of the ‚ÄúNaltrexone is evil! Naltrexone will send you into precipitated withdrawals!‚Äù The dose makes the poison. It doesn‚Äôt take a pharmacologist to understand that ANY amount of naltrexone is going to send you into precipitated withdrawals. Think about it. There is an LD 50 for most substances for a reason. The dose makes the poison. Even arsenic, a poison by most accounts, is harmless at the quantities many of us consume daily in the course of regular diets. And many medications have paradoxical effects at different dosages. Mirtazapine for example, causes sleepiness at lower doses but is stimulating at higher doses. And for those of you yet to believe, Google Oxytrex, an investigational medication combining an opiate with naltrexone to reduce tolerance. \n\nI'm not a scientist but I believe what is happening here is something like a very gradual replacement of the kratom at the opiate receptors with naltrexone, it having a higher affinity and half life means that subsequent kratom dosing doesn't allow the opportunity for it to glom onto fresh receptors. By taking a little more naltrexone every evening fewer and fewer \"fresh/open\" receptors are available for the kratom.\n\nI've done this at least a half dozen times and have had no withdrawal symptoms save a bit or restless leg on the very first night. I'm not recommending it or saying it will work for you. YMMV\n\nGodspeed",

I did what they asked of me only at my wits end, only at being kicked out did i actually empty the drawers, the closets, my bed.

I do want to remember. but those are far away. i don't interact with them and they don't give temptation either of course, that has never been my purpose with any of it.

    "title": "Abusive Treatment at Methadone Clinic",
    "selftext": "Hey guys, long time lurker here, I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôve posted here or there from time to time but I don‚Äôt usually share too much on here. What I can say is just reading others stories and knowing we‚Äôre not alone and that other people have dealt with some of this craziness that is addiction and recovery has always been a big help to me. This community is incredibly supportive and I think fostering that kind of environment is hugely important for people trying to do better and recover.\n\nIn 2022 I started attending a methadone clinic, something that terrified me before I stepped through the doors. I had spent 5 years prior to that slowly losing the person I used to be, spiraling from Percocets to oxycodone and eventually fentanyl when I just didn‚Äôt care to keep up the illusion anymore. Well the clinic wasn‚Äôt perfect immediately and it took time for me to find the right dose and also to let go of the lifestyle and really work and do the program the way it‚Äôs meant to be. But what was always clear and super helpful was the environment at the clinic was very much the same, one of caring and working to improve and understanding we‚Äôre human and we‚Äôve made mistakes but that they don‚Äôt have to define us. My counselors were very much a lifeline to me because much of my immediate family are addicts themselves and sadly due to many of my own actions in active addiction, I don‚Äôt have a ton of friends to turn to. Unfortunately it somewhat feels like time stood still for me through half a decade of addiction but the world kept spinning without me and now I‚Äôm kinda just stuck behind. So when I say I‚Äôve absolutely used the counseling as a crutch, it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve for sure took for granted, having somebody I trust and can be honest and open with..\n\nAnyways for the past 8 months or so there has been a ton of overturn at the clinic. Slowly the little family I felt like I had gained started having members move away. I tried not getting attached but it‚Äôs hard being expected to open up to someone and then they just leave one day without ever even a goodbye in some circumstances. Well the staff has dropped to ridiculous numbers at this point, after the most recent quit we have two counselors left, our program director has either quit or been fired, staff have been leaving left and right for months with no replacements ever coming in. We‚Äôre lucky to get any individual counseling or attention at this point, and that‚Äôs if Counselor B even cared.\n\nCounselor B is everyone‚Äôs worst nightmare at the clinic. Far removed from the welcoming environment when I walked in the doors in 2022, Counselor B can usually be hear scolding or talking down on a patient, without a care for who is around. She‚Äôs been here for a couple months now, and I‚Äôve heard rumors she‚Äôs a probation officer. I get CO vibes personally. As one example, yesterday I came in to dose and a patient was upset and confiding in our other counselor about something that had happened. Counselor B followed her into the other counselors office and screamed at her to the point we couldnt hear the nurses to even confirm our doses. Another staff member had to literally shut the door to muffle the screaming as she was belittling the patient. Now, I have no clue what happened or who did what but I think there‚Äôs proper channels that should be gone down and it‚Äôs kind of wild to be screaming at grown adults who are choosing to come here. But I went along with my business and left, that was until today.\n\nToday, before I could dose I was told I needed to see Counselor B because I had to be assigned a counselor as like I said previously, mine just recently quit. I walked down to her office and we officially met for the first time. She quickly started scanning my file and sees I have a balance I owe the clinic. Now im not going to get into a whole other long backstory on the balance, but basically during this lack of oversight and staff my insurance started billing the clinic differently, and mycopay went from 45 to 115. However nobody said anything to me for almost 6 months and suddenly came to me with this crazy balance that I supposedly owe. But I have been paying it off regardless and just yesterday I paid 4 times my new 5 dollar copay. Until this latest director has suddenly left I had been in constant communication with her over the balance and been making payments and everything was fine as far as I knew. Well Counselor B made it clear I need to pay more and wanted to hear nothing about my prior agreements or arrangements, informing me (Former director) wasn‚Äôt here anymore. I just wanted to get out and I‚Äôve been paying anyways so I agreed and left to dose.\n\nWhen I get to the line to dose, I‚Äôm told there‚Äôs still a flag on my account. Once again for the same issue. She calls Counselor B, who instead of just removing it, informs her she needs to send me down again. At this point the pharmacy is 20 minutes past when it‚Äôs supposed to close and I‚Äôm the last patient in the building minus one or two others. When I came back, she informed me that I messed up and that I was all focused on the money that I left without setting up a date for my counseling session‚Ä¶ So I replied back, I didn‚Äôt do anything.\n\nOh man that was the wrong reply, this lady hit the fan. If you wanna get smart with me I don‚Äôt care if you dose you can sit out there all day, I‚Äôm the person trying to help you! I said, alls I said was I didn‚Äôt bring up the money you did. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt bring it up I said you have a balance! If you wanna keep talking back I‚Äôll put you in your place don‚Äôt you ever talk to me‚Äù. During this verbal attack I coughed a single time and she started hurling insults at me ‚ÄúYou nasty thing you‚Äôre disgusting don‚Äôt you ever cough like that in my office you cover your damn mouth‚Äù\n\nAt this point I pretty much started disassociating. I was already kinda down and having a tough time losing my counselor but the idea that this is my new reality and I just have to take it because I need my medication to function. I don‚Äôt want to end up further behind or dead and like I‚Äôm just trying to do the right thing and I don‚Äôt think I really did anything that warranted that kind of yelling or onslaught of abuse for her mistake. I wouldn‚Äôt think as my new counselor you would want some super adversarial relationship, how is that going to aide in recovery? And I‚Äôve always got along really well with all my counselors and the staff, meanwhile every patient is having issues with Counselor B.\n\nEven after she let me leave her office she still refused to remove the flag for another 15-20 minutes. The nurses called her several times, the last of which I could honestly hear her screaming over the phone line at the girl. I told them straight up she‚Äôs doing this in retaliation toward me, over speaking up and defending myself. I was almost an hour late to work, risking losing my job when I‚Äôm trying to do everything right. Honestly it feels like she absolutely hates her job and is just taking it out on us, she clearly has no respect or even like us and as a recovering addict, Idk im kind of used to it but I guess it‚Äôs just different coming from my own clinic. It‚Äôs somewhere I used to feel safe and honestly, as embarrassing as it is, i left there in tears today because of now she treated me and the way she held my meds over my head like that. It was very triggering and reminded me how my drug dealers used to treat us when I‚Äôd be dopesick for three days and god forbid I speak up for myself, it‚Äôs like get in line or you‚Äôre going to suffer. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs how a professional at a medical clinic should be behaving am I crazy though? I don‚Äôt feel crazy when I type it out I just don‚Äôt understand what triggered such a hateful attack on me\n\nAnyways I apologize for the long post and i appreciate anyone that takes the time to read it. I just really feel kind of lost and by myself right now. I don‚Äôt really have anyone I can turn to for advice and part of me is scared anything I do is going to escalate it and I don‚Äôt want to retaliated against. At the same time a big part of me says she was super wrong in her behavior and if she‚Äôs doing it to me she‚Äôs doing it to others and she clearly is getting worse now that there‚Äôs no director even overseeing the operations. I‚Äôve got an email outlined for corporate that I‚Äôm debating sending, I‚Äôve also been looking into other clinics. I don‚Äôt feel like I should be the one to have to leave but the insane staff shortage is bad as is and now this, I don‚Äôt know. Any advice or similar stories would be appreciated though. I‚Äôm not even dosing tomorrow and im honestly so worried about even going back it was humiliating being screamed at like that staff were literally watching from down the halls and staring..",

Was on suboxone for about a month and then tapered down and went completely off of it.  The withdrawals were TERRIBLE and they are still not completely gone (still no appetite, shivering, no sleep).  Today I am getting my car from the shop and I know there is a very very small piece of fent in the car.  Like a couple of grains.\nHere is my question.  If I take a small amount of opiates today will it reset my withdrawals where I will have to go through everything again?\n\nI just want some fucking relief I can't handle thi much longer \n\nETA - Thank you so much for all the replies.  There is no brotherhood/sisterhood like adddiction.  I seriously hope for the best for all of you.  You all know what I am going thru and keep going thru and keep getting off of and keep going back to.  I am hoping this is IT.  I went into rehab myself.

I'm taking 1 mg of clonazepam a day and 30 mg of vyvanse which I guess doesn't make me clean.  I don't even know anymore.  I'm just trying to live a good life.",

Then I stopped being prescribed and I just came off of it, pretty easily. I missed the high, but I didn't have any setbacks. \nThen the past year and a half I was having really horrendous endometreosis symptoms, so I bought the 'over the counter' solpadine that's the equivelent of around 15mg/20mg cocodemol for two tablets? I was taking about four to six tablets a day, every other day, and then a few months ago (August 2nd, to be exact) I was really low in mood and just stopped taking them?\n\nI've been experimenting with birth control prescribed by my doctor, and I came off of it as I was beginning to get horrendous anxiety, panic attacks, derealisation - all hyper, intrusive thoughts that were making me feel horrendous. I've been slowly getting back to normal, but my anxiety is still bad at times, usually before my period. I was worried that, what if this isn't the hormonal contraception that's caused this, what if this is my body going through some kind of withdrawals from the cocodemol?\n\nPlease note, I don't have any symptom (such as bad stomach, flu symptoms, cold or hot temperature, dizziness) but just the anxiety and panic attacks. Though it's been three months now I've felt like this, under the guidance of my doctor and I believing it's hormonal - I obviously haven't mentioned the use of cocodemol as I didn't want to sound silly.

    "selftext": "Spooky right? That day I went to the hospital. I was brought to the emergency room because the heroin I was shooting was definitely cut with xylazine, and created these horrible open wounds on both of my arms, had been getting worse over time. The wounds became infected while my dad was in the hospital for his 12% functioning heart. When he was in the hospital I just couldn't do anything about my arms.... I couldn't bear the thought of not being able to see my dad while he stayed in that hospital bed. He was there for 12 weeks. \n\nWhile he was in the hospital, I was using old antibiotics to keep the infection at bay. It worked. Until I ran out. Suddenly I fell very ill... In 2.5 short days, I went from walking and eating, to sleeping all day and literally stumbling to the bathroom. I fell on my way to the bathroom 3 times in a row andy boyfriend took me to the hospital. \n\nI had to admit to him what was going on. He had no idea why I was so sick. I hid everything from him, all of my using and arm issues from shooting under the guise of a \"skin condition\". \n\nThat day was the hardest day of my life. But also the most valuable. My parents both got to the hospital. I told them, too. It was terrible. It was awful. When I look back on that day, I see it as one of the best things to ever happen to me. \n\nI'd been shooting for 5-6 years... And using pills, oxy, Dilaudid, Vicodin at the beginning. I'd been in that opiate prison for over a decade, more than 12 years actually. \n\nI was a total dick at the hospital, unbeknownst to me at the time. Because of the sepsis, I started to get very confused. They needed me to be still for radiographs and an echocardiogram, but I did t understand, and wouldn't be still. They had to sedate me and start me on IV antibiotics immediately. Because of how severe my drug use was, they sedated me once and I fought it and ripped out my IV. Then they dosed me again with more of the same sedative or a different one, and that didn't really work either. While they keep giving me more sedatives, I keep getting less aware of what I was doing but was still functioning. Eventually they had to restrain me to the bed. Some of the nurses had a really hard time dealing with me, I wasn't making anything easy. \n\nThat staff at the hospital was amazing. Despite the shit I put them all through, they treated me like a human being... They did notake me suffer... And they got me onto Suboxone. \n\nThey saved my life in a lot of ways. Literally, by stopping that infection before it reached my heart, and by getting me on Suboxone to stop me from killing myself later.\n\nI can't believe I am alive. I can't believe I don't physically need heroin. \n\nFriday, September 13th, 2024 is the last day I used heroin. I know I'm not clean to everyone, but I'm clean to me. I'm so proud of myself... I'm 1 month over that hump. I feel strong and powerful.\n\nI hope one day I can help addicts get through this. I didn't think it was possible. To me, Suboxone is a fucking God send. \n\nThanks for reading.\nI'm going to be okay. ",

I let my anxiety hold me back and I don‚Äôt apply for software jobs anymore because I just assume that without benzos, they will not hire me because they will see how anxious and uncanny I am (maybe even Asperger‚Äôs, idk).\n\nRight now I‚Äôm working with my Dad as an electrician, but I know it‚Äôs not a long term solution. All of this financial situation is just causing so much stress, you know, I only let it get this bad because I told myself that when I lost everything, I would just delete myself from this life, but now I‚Äôve realized that I don‚Äôt have whatever it takes to do that, and besides, I don‚Äôt want to hurt my wife and my daughter and other family anymore than I already have.\n\nI am also unemployed from software engineering for 3 years and that makes it so much harder to get back into the field. I‚Äôm not even sure that I want to go back into the field, it was part of the cause of a lot of my anxiety and depression and suicidal thoughts in the first place. I wish I could be a pilot somehow and do that for money, but I don‚Äôt really see a path forward to do anything new right now.\n\nPlease guys, any advice you can give me or anyone that can relate. I don‚Äôt care if I have to brainwash myself somehow, maybe positive affirmations, idk??? I am 31M right now, and the longer I wait, the harder it‚Äôs going to be to change anything.\n\nEDIT:\nI forgot to mention, working with my Dad is just driving me completely insane, he‚Äôs so negative all the time, just completely focused on negativity and saying horrible things. My whole family is a mess. Mom and Dad are both alcoholics, mom is recovered, but Dad is drinking again, just a couple beers every night but still. My sister and her husband are always fighting and they have a child in the middle of that. My Dad was trying to move himself, my grandma, my sister, and myself all into the same old house at the same time and I just know it would have turned out horribly, I feel like he‚Äôs gone insane. I feel like almost everyone around me has gone insane, myself included.\n\nI‚Äôve been trying to read the Bible a lot and get closer to God, but I‚Äôm not sure, I think it might be hurting more than helping right now. I might even have schizophrenia, I‚Äôm not sure. I have these bizarre synchronicities and it feels like the universe is taunting me.",

His own little brother... I finally came clean to my parents about both of us and I am getting sober, but we are not sure what to do about my brother.\n\nI know it sounds like im putting all of the blame on him for me becoming an addict, but im not kidding when i say he TRIES to make me stay on oxy. I have texts with him explaining how tired i am of this life, and that i hate how angry the drugs have made him and how much we fight. His responses are basically telling me i should not stop.\n\nLast year I quit for 40 days, and he came in my room and started constantly suggesting we take oxy until finally my addict brain just caved in and i relapsed.\n\nI used to HATE oxy and xanax, and all drugs really,  because i saw what it was doing to my brother. i couldnt stand even hearing him play music with it in it. I then moved in with him, and slowly but surely he kept telling me how great oxy is, and that we should do some together. And eventually i just caved in. He made it sound incredible, and said the withdrawals are just diarrhea for a few days and then youre perfectly fine. God was he lying.\n\n# So, heres the Problem:\n\n**The opiates have made him a very angry person, and we recently had a fight which changed something in me mentally. i am finally fed up and disgusted with taking drugs.**\n\n**Because of this, I came clean to my parents about both of us using. The problem is, None of us know what to do about my brother. He has become mean and angry and we just dont know how to handle it. I have finally cut him off and realized i cant be anywhere near him.**\n\n**If he isnt ready to stop should anyone say anything to him? If so , should it be just me or me and my parents?**\n\n**We have been renovating a house for almost the past year, and were finally ready to move in, but i hit my last straw with this last fight, and had to tell my parents that we both take oxy and I want to get clean so i absolutely can not live with him. He is now in the house alone.**\n\n**My brother definitely knows the oxy is a big part of why i cant be near him, but yet that still isnt enough to stop him. Losing his little brother, who hes been closest to for his ENTIRE LIFE, is not enough to make him want to get clean.**\n\n**Do we keep it a secret that my parents know, or just let him know that they are aware of everything and are worried about him?**\n\nIm sorry this was a long post. Its just such a messed up long story i want to make sure you guys kind of get at least somewhat of an idea of how bad it is.\n\nThanks in advance for any help.

    "selftext": "I (f27) stay at my boyfriend‚Äôs (25m) house for most of the week, maybe 3 or 4 days. Sometimes in a row and sometimes space in between, but for the most part it‚Äôs a few days. I usually go home the night before I have to work. I am an emt at my town fire department and I work 18 hour shifts from 6am to 12am for 2-3 days a week. I have to be up at 5am and it affects my sleep schedule for the rest of the week. Especially now that we/i have established routines. \n\nWhen we first got together tho I was on drugs (for about 4 years. And at my worst I was taking about 80mg of Percocet a day, drinking heavy all the time). I was severely depressed (have been since about 12 years old. I‚Äôve tried medication and raw dogging. I feel like I dont need medication at this point because I can feel that I am no where near as depressed as I‚Äôve been my whole life basically. I feel like I have air and light around me now if that makes sense. I have healthy coping mechanisms now, I‚Äôm in therapy, have access to recovery services, and for the first time In My life I have real motivation to get better and never get as low as I was before. With all that being said, I do think I have a personality disorder of some sort. Maybe bpd). I also had 2 ems jobs when we first got together, with me working about 60 hours a week and having 24 hour shifts sometimes. \n\nI say all that to say this: because I am no longer living a volatile and inconsistent lifestyle and have established routines and more healthy living habits, I get sleepy wayyyyy earlier now. I was able to stay up for 48 hours at a time when I was at my worst. But now I‚Äôm exhausted at 10pm. Especially when I‚Äôm at my bf‚Äôs house. But I also notice when I‚Äôm at home I‚Äôm able to stay awake longer. Maybe until 2/3/4am. But I‚Äôm at my home in my own space where I can do whatever i want, whenever I want and I can‚Äôt do that at his house (he lives in the basement alone but his mother and younger brother are upstairs, I also live with my parents and younger sister). When I‚Äôm home I can just feel myself not be tired and I think that‚Äôs because I‚Äôm alone and get to do whatever I please in the comfort of my own space vs when I‚Äôm at his house and we do whatever we can there due to the limitations . Whether that be video games, movies, watching sports, etc. the dilemma is that we are In the bed and in the dark or cuddled up for these activities. Sometimes I hit a wall or I get comfy or I can‚Äôt lie, I‚Äôll be a little bored and I become soooooo exausted. He and I both suggest walks or going skating or taking a drive to wake me up but when we come back from these activities, I literally still cannot fight through. He says that he feels abandoned and that I have no willpower because I cannot stay awake or I won‚Äôt wake up to my alarms. He says he feels I value the sleep more than quality time with him. He doesn‚Äôt like sitting next to a sleeping corpse because that is not hanging out or quality time. He wants to spend time with me and not my sleeping body. AND I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND HIM AND AGREE. \n\nAnd I‚Äôve been trying so hard to find ways to stay awake. I‚Äôve bought all kinds of energy drinks but they shred my stomach and give me reflux. I‚Äôve taken up walking and exercising, started taking Vitamins and supplements, started eating better, started losing weight. All kinds of stuff to try and find a little bit more energy at the end of the day. Sometimes I‚Äôll try to nap, but it‚Äôll be at the end of the day around 9/10 pm when I get sleepy and it turns into real slumber because I cant wake up out of it. Somwtimes I can find a second wind and sometimes I physically cannot. I‚Äôm also a very heavy sleeper and I cancel the alarms in my sleep and he says that I‚Äôm mean to him when he tries to wake me up but I don‚Äôt remember this. This causes the cycle to repeat the next day because now I wake up at like 7 am and he wakes up at 11 because he has gone to sleep later than me. So we‚Äôre already starting off the day on Different schedules and I know I‚Äôm going to get tired sooner than him. \n\nWe had an argument today where he said that it is the only unattractive part of me and it aggravates him that I can‚Äôt stay awake and I‚Äôm like an old woman. I have told him what was different from the time we started dating to now.

I was puking daily, and I had pick up drop off with uber guys through my insurance and the amount of times I had to ask them to pull over so I could puke was embarrassing, although they mostly all were kind. Any way ignore my ramble, my biggest symptom on methadone was anger. I am a pacifist, lover not a fighter, but on the methadone I was so filled with rage over the tiniest things! People talking annoyed me, the thoughts in my head became almost downright homicidal. I have never felt that way ever in my life even with my bipolar disorder. \n\n<I had to get off the stuff, I went in and begged for them to taper me down. They said they could do 2mg a week until I hit 0. I told them I couldn't wait that long and just wanted to stop. I stopped all doses that day, the counselor there told me I would relapse and not make it; I left in tears feeling defeated. But I stayed off it, have not bought any drugs and officially have 567 days sober from heroin and fentanyl. \n\n>Did of you guys experience blinding rage with methadone, I get mixed results when I search about it, so curious to hear first hand accounts.

    "selftext": "I worked myself into a pretty deep hole last night. I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about her and it led to a series of spiraling thoughts. I wanted to get high. I haven‚Äôt WANTED to get high in a very long time. There‚Äôs been fleeting moments of an urge, or a certain scenario might cause an involuntary trigger, but last night I wanted it. I wanted to turn all the thoughts off.\n\nI‚Äôve been working hard on myself and trying to stay as positive as possible, but the rejection coupled with the fact that I was instantly replaceable has been a massive blow to what I thought a partnership was and, if I‚Äôm being honest, my ego. When someone goes from telling you they want to spend the rest of their life with you to sleeping with someone else with zero warning or time between, it‚Äôs hard to process. Granted, I don‚Äôt have any concrete proof they‚Äôre sleeping together, but all the signs are there. Especially when you‚Äôre viewing it as the loser ex that was left behind. You run through all of the ‚Äúwhat does he have that I don‚Äôt‚Äù questions. Of course, the obvious answer is, he‚Äôs not a recovering heroin addict, and I got nothing to say to that.\n\nSo, it‚Äôs just all my fault.( I know rationally this isn't true, but since when are heroin addicts rational)\n\nThen it becomes my regret to carry. I fucked this up just like I fucked up everything else. I‚Äôm the loser that can‚Äôt do anything right and that will never be happy because I‚Äôm essentially unlovable, and it‚Äôs wrecked my body, I look like skelator, and my shame has me always walking on eggshells, so I‚Äôm afraid to communicate, and I‚Äôm ugly, and always in pain and my dick isn‚Äôt big enough and doesn‚Äôt‚Äô always work right, I‚Äôm probably incapable of love anyway and I‚Äôm probably  just pretending to love the things that I do hoping that everything falls into place, and I never deserved to be loved anyway so what right do I have to be sad about losing it, and didn‚Äôt I do the same thing to my ex-wife. Didn‚Äôt I just drop the bombshell on her one day that she was not the love of my life and someone else was. What right do I have to be so devastated by the woman I left my wife for monkey branching her way into another relationship.\n\n Lose them how you get them, right? \nI thought I was doing the right thing. I probably did. As much as I want the truth to be different, the simple fact is, I was unhappy in my marriage, and I was using drugs to cope. I wanted a different life, and I was too scared to say anything, so I got high constantly to stay complacent‚Ä¶\n\n and the regret comes in waves‚Ä¶\n\nand there‚Äôs a hurricane hitting Florida, and missile launces in the middle east, and all I can think about is my pathetic love life and it‚Äôs all just more evidence that I‚Äôm just as much of a loser as I thought I was‚Ä¶\n\n and the regret becomes its own hurricane, and I‚Äôm stuck spinning with it as the thoughts pile on louder and louder‚Ä¶\n\n YOUR‚ÄôRE A LOSER AND A JUNKIE, AND THAT‚ÄôS ALL YOU‚ÄôLL EVER BE!!! Fucking junkie loser why don‚Äôt you just keep crying about it, you can‚Äôt handle real life and you‚Äôll never be able to‚Ä¶\n\nAnd I just want to TURN IT THE FUCK OFF.\n\nOne hit.\n\n A little dog food, a little fetty, a little H, a little tooter, a single blow/rip/snort/push/hit/smack/gack/ of china and everything stops.\n\nIf I‚Äôm lucky maybe my heart stops too. Let someone else deal with my problems. \n\nI want to say I had a positive epiphany that lifted me out of this, but I didn‚Äôt. I still hurt, and I still don‚Äôt understand, but I went to sleep sober. I woke up sober, and I feel a little lighter today.\n\nI guess in the end, though the storm was devastating, it wasn‚Äôt quite as bad as I was telling myself it would be.\nFuck her and whatever her definition of me is.\nI can do this.\n\n ",

I‚Äôm planning to use ibuprofen and acetaminophen, anything else help?\n\nMy wife has been incredible support helping me beat this addiction. She tapered me off over the course of two months, but I still jumped off a decent amount because we were running out of time prior to surgery, and I wanted minimum 2 weeks clean. \n\nMy DOC was oxy, but upon losing access to pharma grade had to switch to hydro for the taper. They were legit hydros, popped them out of blister packs myself. Plus I needed a shit ton per dose. A few times a friend gave me some which I was skeptical of, and upon taking just one I got high and knew they were fake, so didn‚Äôt take them much cause I was scared how hard fent and whatever else it was cut with would be to get off of.

If anyone doesn‚Äôt know that‚Äôs like the smallest possible dose you could take. In 2 weeks I‚Äôm hoping to get off it entirely. So before I get into it I do want to point out it could be from the suboxone but like I said it‚Äôs such a tiny dose I‚Äôm like how tf can it have that much of a hold on me and I‚Äôm praying after I‚Äôm off it completely these symptoms will subside.\nThese are my recovery body issues.\n1. SWEATING LIKE A MOFO. So basically I sweat soooooo much. All the goddamn time. But mostly at night, I sleep with basically a a giant cotton pad in my duvet cover so it‚Äôs not like I have a heavy blanket on, I braid my hair every night to keep the hair off the back of my neck which does help. And 9/10 times sleep naked. But even during the day I sweat so much. Any form of physical activity or nerves Im moist lol. I walk to work and have to change my clothes when I get there cuz im sweaty. Last night in my NA meeting I was sweating like crazy to the point I could feel it trickling down my back. It‚Äôs cold outside now too. But I‚Äôm getting tired of constantly having pit stains. But I‚Äôm still usually cold. \n2. SHAKY HANDS. I shake like crazy. It actually might be diet related however I‚Äôm trying to eat much healthier, I started ordering hello fresh to get more veggies in my diet cuz I hate cooking and that‚Äôs helping me eat better for sure. But I still find my hands are always shaking (im 30 years old btw not 65), and it is normally when I havnt eaten in a couple hours. I don‚Äôt drink coffee often, I have maybe 2 teas during the day and a couple monsters during the week - yes I know thats probably causing the shaking on those days lol.\n3. THE SEPTUM DAMAGE. I can‚Äôt breathe at night, anytime I‚Äôm horizontal it‚Äôs like my nose just clogs. The last 2 years of my using I was mostly injecting, but for the 6 years leading up to that I was shoving blow and ox up my nose in great amounts daily. So needless to say my nose is effed. You can see I have a deviated septum just from looking at my nose straight on, but the worst part is I feel like I constantly have these hard boogers (this is very hard for me to write cuz I have a phobia of boogers and even the word makes me want to throw up) but I‚Äôm constantly pulling huge boogers out my nose, this never used to be a thing. Ever. It‚Äôs to the point it distructs my breathing now I know this issue probably won‚Äôt get better without septum surgery which I‚Äôm going to inquire about.But has anyone had this issue? Has anyone made it better with like air purifiers or anything like that? \n\nHere‚Äôs a recap of my daily health habits just for extra info if it‚Äôs useful. we‚Äôre clear I do drink a LOT of water, I‚Äôm not a healthy person. But I‚Äôm trying. I walk 30 min too and from work each day. Plus I‚Äôm on my feet my whole shift. So I get basic physical movement in my daily life. I keep a very clean home. And like I said I‚Äôm trying to eat better. I don‚Äôt eat terrrribly I know I used to eat worse, but we‚Äôre improving. I do struggle with energy and showering daily, I shower every other day sometimes every 3rd depending on how often I‚Äôm working and I know that sounds gross but I struggle with the motivation of getting in the shower and drying my hair etc. I hate getting wet. Even tho I always feel better once I‚Äôm out. Again I never used to be this way, I used to showever every single day after work. I‚Äôm female, 5‚Äô2‚Äù roughly 115lbs. Also my doc did prescribe oxybutynen and natroxon? for the sweating and the side effects made me so fucking groggy and they didn‚Äôt help with the sweating so I‚Äôm not taking them.\n\nIf anyone actually read all this- thank you. Maybe I can publish this novel one day. ",

    "selftext": "One summer day I walked into a doctor office and got a script for 120x 80mg OxyContin.... \n\nAt the time I had a wife (my high school sweetheart) and we were getting used to being parents to our son who was 2 years old at the time. I first started doing opiates recreationally when I was 15. Almost 20 years ago. That, along with anything else I could get my hands on. And for a very long time, the bouncing between drugs method to being a highly functional addict worked perfectly. Sure, I had a few instances where I‚Äôd get a couple hundred 10mg yellow norcos and binge on them enough to experience some mild withdrawals, but I was always able to be done when I ran out. It was my once or twice a year treat I‚Äôd do after the first snow fell onto Detroit. I‚Äôd lock myself in a room and play video games. \n\nI would DJ downtown at the clubs throughout my twenties, and got it in pretty hard. Ain‚Äôt no party like a Detroit party... It was the rave scene. Which was still going strong in the D back when I was first introduced to it in 2002. I was a kid in a candy store - mixing savage amount of drugs for about 15 years straight. We would always carry this vile filled to the top, containing cocaine, MDMA, 2C-i and ketamine. That vile was what me and my boy (who was my partner in both DJaying and crime) would consider our nightly driver, and we perfected its ratio as if we were working on the cure for fucking cancer. This of course was including whatever other drugs we could get our hands on because after all, there are starving kids in China. \n\nFor the longest time in that scene it was all just partying and candyflipping. Hundreds of nitrous tanks, psychedelics, ethenogens, phenethylamines, trimethylamines and girls üòç. Sex drugs and techno. The only thing that was missing in excess were the opiates. Even at the after hours clubs, where anything goes, they still wouldn‚Äôt allow open opiate use. I should have taken that as a huge sign. When criminals don‚Äôt even tolerate junkies that says a lot. \n\nBy the time I was 28 I had made a lot of money dealing drugs, weed and selling thousands of nitrous balloons balloons at parties. We‚Äôd  take our money and put 20% overhead toward the next party and this went on for years. I would say nitrous oxide was the drug that crossed me over to the dark side. They call it hippy crack for a reason. Despite that, I had my house paid off. Three ridiculously loud vehicles paid off. Campers, boats you name it. I had it all and I completely got away with it too. After one too many binges it was time I hung up my decks and headphones. I squirted one into my wife and I was ready to grow up. I was tapped out. \n\nI‚Äôll admit I wasn‚Äôt ready to be a dad. I tried my hardest to be clean. I did it for the first 8 months of his life. But I couldn‚Äôt run my medical marijuana business and be a stay at home dad without cocaine. Especially with a 20 year hangover. And cocaine makes people insufferable and sleep deprived. Then the alcohol got bad too. I crashed a couple times and eventually got a DUI. \n\nBeing the model addict I was determined to beat the system. ‚ÄúThey can‚Äôt deny a prescription‚Äù, I thought. I was determined to stay fucked up. So in August I see my probation officer with my OxyContin script in hand. And before I show him he says, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre done. You passed all your drug tests (phew!) and haven‚Äôt been a pain in my ass, so enjoy the rest of your summer‚Äù\n\nSometimes I wonder where I‚Äôd be if I just tossed that script away. I certainly wouldn‚Äôt be writing this living out of a 2004 beat up Impala. But there‚Äôs no going back now. My ex who hilariously decided to become a cop had enough of me once our shared last name made it into the system. I came home one day to a note and my family was gone. Just me and my things.... and 120x 80mg OxyContin....\n\nBy the time the bottle was gone I was already lining up my dope. I forgot to mention that I always dabbled with a couple packs here and there throughout my party days. I actually shot dope when I was 16 and my ex wife (who was just my high school sweetheart then) found out and warned me then... ‚ÄúOpiates or me‚Äù. In hindsight, I always knew she left because of that script. But I played the victim at the time because you all know what time it was...\n\nNothing numbs pain like heroin. So instead of doing the right thing, I slept. I had enough money to support that habit for three years. Within a month I got up to 3 grams of tan powder per day. Just snorting it tho... you know... because I didn‚Äôt want to be a junkie... lol\n\nMy partner in crime and his girl were already one year in. They showed me the ropes and eventually when I lost custody of my son they helped me tie off. To this day I close my eyes and say ‚Äúmmmm‚Äù when I see blood rush back into a syringe. Slowly we melted away from everything we loved. And the dope started getting whiter...\n\nI remember the first time I shot fentanyl. I woke up in a bathtub with eyes staring at me in horror. And the only thing I said was ‚Äúgive me more‚Äù. Only my buddy laughed. He‚Äôll always be my evil twin and I‚Äôll always be his. We all got fired from our jobs. I was supporting us all with my harvests until my buddy got his monthly insurance payout check and he‚Äôd reciprocate. Eventually we realized (after his girl crashed the car a few times) that we needed to level off. Every boy needs a girl after all. \n\nEnter crack. There‚Äôs nothing in the world that will exponentially make you use more dope faster than smoking crack all day. Our daily order became one ball of each. We became fiends. Racing thru the drugs. Accusing each other of stealing our hits. Carpet surfing. My buddy‚Äôs girl started tricking behind his back. The spots got darker and grimier. The bandos and traps smelled of death. Sometimes we couldn‚Äôt wait til we got home and we‚Äôd get stuck in the traps for days. Walk in with cash and walk out with the trauma of seeing someone OD and just get rolled under the floorboards. That was the moment I woke up. This is not me. That was someone‚Äôs daughter. Just thrown away like trash. \n\nDidn‚Äôt stop me from figuring out what the deep web had to offer though. Finally I could just stay home and never have to see that horrible shit again. I found a vendor that was perfect and for a year I sat in bed shooting pure fentanyl and fishscale. God bless bitcoin and darknetmarkets. I got into all the analogues too. FuFent, BuFent, tried doing 4isoButryl to quit. It made me violently ill. And eventually my vendor hit me up and said he had a line on carfentanil. I told him no way.... at first. Then he assured me it was properly cut. \n\nHe sent me a tester. I sorted out a tiny little bump. Understand, by this time I was up to 3 grams of his ‚Äúpure‚Äù (ya right) fentanyl HCL per day. At least that‚Äôs what his listing said. When I snorted that CF I fell out for 36 hours. All I remember is a massive tingling sensation cover my body and I was unconscious. Fast forward two months later and I was shooting 50mg of this premixed CF twice per day....\n\nAnd then the DEA shut down the big three and suddenly he was gone.... Fuck My Life....\nSo just to let you all know, back then the word carfentanil wasn‚Äôt on the news describing imagery like tranquilized elephants. Nobody knew what the fuck it was. Let alone where to get it.... I had to resort to banging 5 grams of street fentanyl per day *just to stay well*... Finally I realized that this was no longer manageable. It didn‚Äôt matter if I grew a forest of weed to sell. \n\nSo I started my research and diligently sourced a rapid drug detox center in Royal Oak, MI. They touted a cure that involved putting me under anesthesia and flushing me out with Narcan and vitamins. ‚ÄúYou will come out of this feeling like you‚Äôre in week 6!!‚Äù they said... motherfuckers....\n\nSo if you ever want to know what the precipitated withdrawal feels like coming off carfentanil look this place up. I cannot begin to even describe the agony of this experience. I literally have PTSD from it. Not only had these doctors never heard of carfentanil, they just rather assumed I was a stupid junkie who didn‚Äôt know what he was on. \n\nI don‚Äôt remember this part personally, but they said that when they administered the Narcan I immediately went into a seizure. They administered some kind of sedative to bring me out of that, and when they did they told me I flopped around like a fish unconscious, until I woke up out of the anesthesia and they had to knock me out again. The only thing I remember is having these insane, physically impossible dreams. Like roads swirling around my head and falling thru the middle of them. Molecules of fire being shaved off by swinging pendulums. Just the weirdest craziest imagery I never thought was possible. Withdrawal dreams...\n\nWhen I awoke I had ataxia. I had shit myself. Pissed myself. And god was electrocuting my soul. The pain was at apex this existence would allow. I managed to roll off the gurney and for some reason just started crawling. The nurses tried stopping me but my fight or flight kicked in. After 18 hours of hell they wheel chaired me to my nurse monitored hotel room where I had my suboxone stash. \n\nThat was the height of my addiction leaving that rapid detox. 5 grams of dope, a ball of crack and 5 Xanax bars was my daily purchase. I sold all my cars. Sold my house. Pawned every last one of my things I thought were so important. Went from 215lb to 125lb. I tried intentionally overdosing 3 separate times. But it‚Äôs really hard to overdose when you have that kind of tolerance. Water can only hold so much fentanyl, and a needle can only hold so much. Nothing is more disappointing in life than waking up from a suicide attempt. The shame and embarrassment of even trying just eats you up. \n\nI‚Äôm not going to bore you with every home detox attempt, treatment center and methadone clinic. Back and fourth from dope to subs. Got up to 225mg methadone. Back to dope. Back to rehab. Back to subs. Back to dope. Rehab. Subs. Dope. Rehabs. Subs. Etc... Six USA treatment centers overall. Years of this. Three years of lowering my tolerance with each treatment. Relapsing when I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. Giving it my all the next time. \n\nSomehow I landed the love of my life during all this. My friends old gal. We went way back. Joked we really should be together. She decides to jump into my situation when I was 125lbs. She literally left the guy she lived with to save my life. I had never felt that before. Being wanted like that. If it weren‚Äôt for her I wouldn‚Äôt be here. She stood by the last two years. Run my baths and try her little heart out to get me through it. Well over 30 at home detox attempts she‚Äôd stand by me for 3-4 days and her heart would sink as she watched me just give up and head to the dope spot. It makes me sick just typing it. I tried kicking her out and ending things many times to rid the guilt of doing this to her. But this little thing wouldn‚Äôt give in. So I didn‚Äôt either. The only reason I include this is because as cheesy as it sounds, love really is the strongest drug in the world. Don‚Äôt worry that‚Äôs not the cure tho lol\n\nSo at my second to last treatment center out in California I meet this dude. Huge body builder but gentle giant. Sweetest guy I‚Äôve ever met. He starts telling me about this crazy treatment he did down in Mexico that cured him. Naturally I ask, well why the fuck are you here if it cured you? ‚ÄúWell it cured my opIate addiction, but now I‚Äôm here for benzos and alcohol‚Äù.... lol\n\nI let it stew for a while. I had heard of Ibogaine a long time ago and always thought it was some bullshit junkie myth. Ya like I‚Äôm gonna go sit in some tribal ceremony and let a witch doctor heal me with voodoo plants. \n\nThen I hit rock bottom....\n\nFuck it! I‚Äôve literally tried everything else. \n\nSide note: I just want to add that up until this point I had always been a vehement atheist. I prayed to Sagan and put all my faith into science. But after living in a bathtub for a quarter of the last three years, I was starting to see myself begging god to make this stop more and more. \n\nSo I made a deal. If this shit cures my physical addiction, and physiologically repairs all the broken neurons, and rewires all the synapses in my brain like the research says it does, then I will not only believe in god, but I will know that he heard my cries. \n\nSo I find this beautiful clinic. At this point mom is paying for me to go because I‚Äôm homeless and broke and have absolutely nothing. She shells out the $4500usd bucks, praying for a miracle.\n\nSo I feel like a total asshole walking into this resort. I‚Äôm used to USA rehabs that are punishment based and have rules and treat you like children. This place was staffed with highly professional on site nurses and doctors catering to you like a baby. Fucking beach view. Personal chef. Netflix/Xbox/PS4. They provide free cigarettes!? Like where the fuck had this rehab been? They can‚Äôt find a vein on my body I haven‚Äôt destroyed so I have to get a central line put in for my IV saline bags. I was there for 5 days and they kept me well with 725mg of morphine per day. Then they tested my heart with an EKG monitor and I‚Äôm cleared for take off. \n\nSuddenly it hits me. What the fuck has happened to my life.... I am in MEXICO üá≤üáΩ with a PICC line inserted damn near into my heart, and I‚Äôm about to eat 25mg/ kilogram of body weight of pure Ibogaine HCL. Somehow I just knew inside that this was the end. That drugs got me into this mess and drugs will get me out. I mean it‚Äôs the perfect ending right?\n\nWell upstairs to my room I go. Test dose. Feel nothing. Hour later. Flood dose 1. Starting to feel shaky. I sneak downstairs and get a few cigarettes in me. And I had to rat on myself because the time I was done I was FUCKED UP. Nurses helped me back to my bed. Scolded me in Spanish and gave me my 2nd flood dose. I‚Äôm vibrating now. Vision is barely possible. My body becomes a noodle. My bones are just vibrating. But there was no pain. Nurse comes in again. ‚ÄúTime for next dose‚Äù.... ‚Äú Are you sure dude? This shits reallly kicking in. ‚ÄúHere swallow. Close your eyes. Listen to your headphones. Flood dose 3 down the hatch. \n\nMy body ceased to exist. The vibrations of the universe shook loose every last opiate in my body. I felt like warm cream. I go unconscious. The visions appear. First my fianc√©. Just appears out of a black void and looks at me. She starts balling. And then her skin gets older and she starts dying and decaying in my arms.\n\nThis goes on and on and on for about an hour and a half. My son. My ex wife. My mom. My dad. My grandma. My friends. Everyone I have ever loved in my life. I watched die in my arms. Which let me tell you is one thing to read in someone else‚Äôs story on a screen. But I cannot emphasize the gravity of what this did to me. It was payback for making everyone I have ever loved watch me die in front of them. Finally I understood. \n\nFinally back to reality but suuuuper fucked up. My body is humming so loud I can hear it. Every time I close my eyes I see my son and I start crying. I hadn‚Äôt cried like that in almost 20 years. And I couldn‚Äôt stop. My eyes just wept for another half hour. \n\nSo that‚Äôs the subjective trip. But what does Ibogaine really do to the brain? Neuroscientists still don‚Äôt know. But they know it works. They know it resets the brain to a pre-addicted state. Research 18-MC and 18-HC and you will see that the scientific community is working on this Ibogaine analog to develop the same effect but without the trip. I have mixed feelings on this. If you ask the people who go through it they will claim god was in that experience. But that‚Äôs not good enough for some people. But I was willing to do anything. And I don‚Äôt think the god experience should be removed. \n\nIbogaine worked for me. It has been working for addicts for over 40 years. Maybe longer in tribal communities. Unfortunately, it works so well that rich addicts are using it as a get out of jail free card to just lower their tolerance and go right back out. But it is the miracle cure - just buried in myths, and advocates of suboxone and a bunch of other stuff that never worked for me. \n\nThat doesn‚Äôt mean Ibogaine should be a last resort. If I did Ibogaine when I first heard about it I would have erased half a decade of hell. So all I want to say to you is that it is the real deal. There are many reputable clinics in Mexico offering this treatment. The one I went to has successfully detoxed over 2,000 patients without a single incident. When I was there I personally witnessed 12 people kick opiates. \n\nThe main thing about it though isn‚Äôt the fact that it completely erases the acute withdrawals. It‚Äôs the fact that after you come out of it, you are you again. Your mental state is clear. You don‚Äôt have that cloud of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a piece of shit‚Äù following you around. You actually feel excited and happy. No dealing with months of depression. And this place prescribed me Lyrica and sent me home with 3 booster doses of the Ibogaine total alkaloid extract. Which is different from the pure HCL extract you get for the big trip. \n\nSo far three weeks later I haven‚Äôt even touched my boosters. I walked back across the border on day 2 off opiates. And the day I left I also got to smoke the infamous Bufo Alvarius toad venom, which contains 5-MEO-DMT. I won‚Äôt go far into that because that was a very personal experience I got to have. But you can read about those experiences elsewhere. And let me tell you. That was the last puzzle piece in my head that allowed me to let go of all the evil shit I had encountered. I was finally forgiven. \n\nUnfortunately my ex isn‚Äôt as forgiving as god... I got some work to do!\n\nBe careful ya‚Äôll. For those that got here, thanks for letting me share. And thank you for helping me stay clean. Love ya reddit.\n\n*I just want to say that Ibogaine is the cure for physical addiction / the broken mental state that lingers for months into recovery. Which in many cases is what causes people to relapse within the first 12-18 months of recovery. Ibogaine is a shortcut to the path of recovery that is lifelong. If you go home after this treatment to the same life, with the same environment, same people and seek no after care / support, you will relapse.* \n\n*Also, thank god we live in a time where suboxone and methadone allow people to have their lives back. Recovery isn‚Äôt a competition. I had 8 months clean times thanks to suboxone. But I was still addicted to a legal opioid. I didn‚Äôt have a big boy job like others that required me to be well. Being a dope fiend was my job. I recognize that despite losing EVERYTHING, I was very fortunate and lucky all things considered. Unfortunately, to all the methadone/ bupe users inquiring about Ibogaine, you must be ~40-60 days off long acting opioids in order to do this treatment. If you are stable and have your life back then keep tapering down. Do not throw away your recovery to do Ibogaine.*\n\n*God bless you all and thank you for the kind words and wonderful responses. I know it was a long one, so I am truly touched by the responses ü•∞*",

    "selftext": "I‚Äôm in my final semester of nursing school. Part of our psychiatric clinical rotation was to go to a state addiction treatment center, where we would assess patients in their stages of withdrawal, and give a few presentations while we were there. It was, of course, the same facility I went to while in the grips of IV heroin addiction. \n\nI got to stand up in front of a group of addicts, in the same room I sat in for 21 days in a row, and explain how their addiction works and how to fight it. \n\nI got to tell these people that they needed to give themselves more, because they‚Äôre worth more than the life they‚Äôve been living. \n\nI never told them I was a former addict, let alone that I had been a patient there just like them. Although, as I spoke one-on-one with a patient about his plan to taper with subutex, he said, ‚ÄúWow, you‚Äôre really knowledgeable about all this.‚Äù And I replied, ‚ÄúYeah, well, I have...a lot of experience with this subject.‚Äù And he just kind of laughed and said, ‚ÄúGot it, you don‚Äôt have to say anything else.‚Äù \n\nOne of the patients I helped admit for alcohol detox wasn‚Äôt sure he‚Äôd stay the full 21 days. He thought he might just do the detox and leave.\n\nI came up to him at the end of the day and told him, ‚ÄúHey man, I know you didn‚Äôt ask for my opinion. But I really think you should stay the whole time. Give yourself some time to just focus on you and your recovery. Getting some space away from the outside world can make a difference.‚Äù And he said he‚Äôd think about it.\n\nHe was still there when I came back the next week. I told him I‚Äôd been thinking about him over the weekend and that I was so proud he‚Äôd decided to stay. It felt good. It felt like a small victory, even though I‚Äôm sure I wasn‚Äôt the deciding factor in all of it. It felt like I made a difference, and paid it forward, just a tiny bit. \n\nI don‚Äôt really have any point in writing this other than just to kind of get it out of my head. It was both a surreal and jarring couple weeks. I never thought I‚Äôd go back to that rehab, but the circumstances in which I did made it all just feel...I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôd like to say it makes me feel as though I‚Äôve come a long way, but I struggle with so much guilt still, that it‚Äôs hard to acknowledge it. This experience was humbling though, and reminded me of where I came from. \n\nI graduate from nursing school on May 19th. On May 21st, I‚Äôll have 3 consecutive years clean from opiates. Pretty cool. \n\nThat‚Äôs all I got. Thanks to anyone who read this.",

My favorite.\n\nHeating pad. \n\nCut the comfort meds off asap but Taper slowly.\n\nBoiled eggs oatmeal beans cheap healthy food.\n\nProbably won't feel like eating for a while though.\n\nYou will also demolish every toilet bowl unfortunate enough to cross your path. Every 2 hours.\n\nYou need to replace those electrolytes and drink a gallon water a day and start small little sips in the beginning.\n\nOh yeah and TIME. \n\nTime helps.\n\nTime is the only thing that will help.\n\n\" They say time supposed to heal ya but I aint done much healing. \" \n\nI know Adele but you gotta wait longer. Trust me.\n\nYou will only sleep a half hour for a few days then 2 hours the second week then 4 hours a night then 6 hours if your lucky in the second month.\n\nSome random nights you won't sleep at all out of no where you think it's getting better than.. WHAM!\n\nThat's why people relapse . This isn't exactly a slow linear progression. This is a confusing up and down painful \"at the mercy of the process\" type of journey.\n\nYou will suffer. It WILL PASS.\n\nYou will think 8 days off or  6 weeks off or 4 months off would be a perfect time to use again.\n\nIt's not.\n\nBut.\n\nIt is a sign that your brain is still completely decimated.\n\nNo normal person every thought taking H at anytime is or will ever be a good idea.\n\nThat's a sick mind that thinks that. Trust me.\n\nI've been plenty sick before my friend. Plenty.\n\nYou're healed when the very thought of dope physically makes you ill because of how truly poisonous and vile a sober mind knows it actually is. That's a sign your real brain is working again. \n\nYou suffer sweat and fight the devil for your life back. Writhe in agony until one day you wake up so powerful that you don't fight your body to move a finger and take an hour to think about getting out of bed. No. Your body finally listens to your mind because you are healed. \n\nFood taste beyond amazing. You can smell again. Sex is finally enjoyable and WAY MORE ENJOYABLE  AGAIN. \n\nIn early recovery people would piss me off saying they got better because even 4 months of paws will make you feel like it never ends.\n\nI literally hated people that smiled. I was hatred incarnate.\n\nNo soul in my body for a good month after I quit.\n\nBut.\n\nYou will laugh again and cry.\n\nYou will make witty jokes. You will one day wake up not sweating not aching not exhausted from not sleeping not fiending but simply just wake up from your precious beauty sleep and realize how disgusting and embarrassing the old junkie version of you was.\n\nYou maintain an attitude of gratitude.\n\nYou begin to exercise not for looks..but because your body wants to be challenged naturally again.\n\nYou confidently ace an interview with a reputable company. \n\nYou take your life and your respect back.\n\nYou remember what it was like to suffer and you help those that are still suffering because we all suffer in some degree and to help one another is to make life an experience worth living.",

I won't elaborate on how I got here because that would actually be helpful to you guys so I'll just overstate my accomplishments to collect likes and feel good about myself anyways have a good day oh well just thought I'd say hi and good luck !\"\n\nIf you come here often you've seen the posts.\n\nMy favorite is the same Goddamn Troll post that seemingly appears every other week...and it's goes something like this..\n\n\" Hey recovering addict friends! It's little Timothy here just letting you all know I found the biggest bag of powdered dope ever! You know the kind of dope good for sniffing and shooting? Yeah that dope! Anyways 40 days clean here and I flushed it! Took a lot of willpower to do it! Anyways hope I didn't trigger anyone and I'm sure this post benefited no one in any way at all but just figured I'd share\"\n\nIt's literally the Same.Pointless. Unhelpful. Vapid. Posts.\n\nYou guys know what I'm talking about.\n\nYou've seen the posts if you visit often.\n\nVisit often huh? Me too.\n\nWhy do we all need to visit here often?\n\nIt's sickening? Isn't it?\n\nYeah we may be clean. \n\nA day. A month. An hour. A year.\n\nBut we still come back.\n\nSomething deep within the very fiber of our being woven deep within the matrix of our DNA is yearning  for something.\n\nOur souls ache. Longing deeply inside.\n\nSearching for something we've never had.\n\nThat something is  closure.\n\nLike a war torn broken solider who has fought to long, killed to many, denied his very morals for the promised glory when all there ever was to be found was blood and endless shame in our conquest for eternal pleasure and refuge from this cold world in a speck of dust called Heroin.\n\nHeroin is an ugly word.\n\nTell a sober person you have done Her-O-in next time you get the chance.\n\nIt's a stark reminder that heroin is a dirty word. It's not dope/smack/diesel.\n\nPercs at 19 years old at a few parties turned into an 11 year battle with opiates with 8 of those years mainly sniffing heroin. Sniffing heroin because I'm a godamn existential yet narsaccistic masochist who kills themselves safely by sniffing not injecting. \n\nYa know? Because it's safer...\n\nNot.\n\nThere is no bottom in heroin. Likewise there is no top. \n\nInterestingly enough with heroin...\n\nIt can take you as high as you want and as low as any human can possibly go.\n\nBut you don't take heroin. Heroin takes you. Every long term junkie know that this is a real drug. Some claim the king of all drugs. The pacifier for all life's woes.\n\nThis drug will skew and offset the default settings of your mind so bad you will think wrong is right and right is wrong by the time it is all over. \n\nYour frontal lobe which controls executive decision making. Your brain stem which controls all involuntary bodily function and your hypothalamus and hippocampus the limbic system so on and so on  every other part of the brain is warped fron using this substance.\n\nIn lay man's terms.\n\nThis drug will fuck your mind up so bad that by the time this Silver Back Guerilla is done anal fucking your skull through your ear... it will turn your little virgin puckered asshole into a loading dock bay for tractor trailers and Boeing 747s.\n\nI'd like to admit that I have been broken too.\n\nI had almost 2 years clean. Again. And relapsed. \n\nThat's the cold dirty truth every one.\n\nRecovery isn't all thumbs up and smiley faces. \n\nI relapsed and my wife caught me by putting a GPS tracker on my phone as I'm driving into the hood in a business suit on my way to work.\n\nThat's real people.\n\nNot funny. Not cool.\n\n30 years old with a mortgage and the damage from heroin was still fucking with me 2 years clean.\n\nI felt okay in sobreity.\n\nI just never actually felt completely unequivocally ....well..... \n\nGreat?\n\nDon't get me wrong.\n\nI had deep moments that felt good. I sure  slept good ate good. Got new things.\n\nBut then.\n\nTotal nunbness.\n\nA void.\n\n.... there was a deep ache like something was missing.\n\nI used for over a decade in my life.\n\nSo..\n\nExercise and walking and a good diet and mediation only goes so far. \n\nYour mind. Our mind is physically damaged. And that's sad.\n\nWe need our mind to think.\n\nSo...\n\nTHINK...\n\n...about that.\n\nSo my point of this post with another 96 days in sobriety again is to not turn a short relapse into a full blown nightmare.\n\nI was complacent and still dealing with chronic back pain fron when I began this long journey 11 years ago. \n\nThought this was behind me like A LOT of One time posters come and claim here but this is truly a life long battle in some form or another. \n\nI mean fucking A guys.\n\nLife could be going good. But as addicts we all have that fuck the world mentality like I can sneak off and change this all right now with a little bit and no One will ever know. \n\nBullshit man. YOU KNOW. That's the only person that ever mattered. \n\nLook I can blame  my abusive criminal and absent father or my just as jaded victimized mother.\n\nBut i take responsibility for never loving myself.\n\n And that has lead to more issues that just drugs in general in my life.\n\n Such as trying to please others.\n\nYour boss didn't give you a raise?\n\nYour wife hasn't made love to you passionately in a year?\n\nFuck it!\n\nHeroin is and has always been there to comfort you and make it all better like God almighty Himself.\n\n.....and when it wears off and you catch cold and your mind is only producing bad thoughts endlessly because you highjacked and overrided the natural reward system the way the real God intended it to be. only then will you really know what a true \" Hell on Earth\" is like people.\n\nThanks for letting me share tonight and listening ladies and gentlemen.\n\nI'm here along side all of you...fighting.",

    "selftext": "You've been sick for days. Dry heaving when you brush your teeth in the morning. Muscles ache, bones throb, nerves on fire, limbs kicking; the pain and restlessness seem unreal. If lucky, you're sleeping for 15 minutes at a time in a drenched bed sheet that isn't going to get washed anytime soon.  You wake up from your 3rd wet dream of the week, only to be bombarded with instant anxiety and the realization that your in hell on earth. Time moves so slow. Nothing is interesting. Even watching YouTube feels like a chore. Conversations feel so awkward, and all you want to be is alone, yet you crave attachment. Most likely you haven't had a gf/bf for an embarrassing amount of time. Nothing matters. Life seems dull and grey. And the only remedy is what got you here in the first place.  \n\nYou somehow power through the days. Physically you feel a little better, but mentally still falling in an abyss. When will you reach the ocean floor? Your missed calls/texts are adding up, yet still no desire to enter back in reality. You tell loved ones you have the flu... The 4th time this year. They know whats up. But you don't have the energy to come clean and validate their disappointment.  But you keep pushing through. You lay in bed, catching yourself praying to a God that you don't even believe in. You are so close to relapse because there seems to be no light at the end of the tunnel. Life seems so dark. Will you ever feel normal again? \n\nYou wake up to the birds chirping, glance at your phone, and surprised it's 7am. You finally take a dump that has an actual shape. Somehow you're able to eat a bowl of cereal. You hop in the shower and stand the entire time, instead of periodically sitting like a school kid as the water temporary cleanses your soul like a baptism.  As you're drying off, the shivering shakes aren't as prevalent. You find the energy to go to the store. When you approach the cashier, you make friendly eye contact and surprisingly it doesn't feel like she stared through your soul. The small talk doesn't seem as forced and your brain reacts a little faster. Possibly even make a corny joke that gets a smile. As you walk back to your car, you notice you're walking a little faster. Muscles aren't aching as bad. Lower back not tied in a knot. The sky looks bluer and the trees a little greener. The gentle breeze dries the sweat off your back, and for once you're content with your body temperature. \n\nTHAT FEELING WHEN the sun shines down on your pale face.. You look up and smile for the first time in a week+. You begin to float up from the ocean floor; equilibrium is in motion, and that radiant light at the end of the tunnel is now visible. The hard part is over, yet deep down you know it has just begun. But for the time being you have hope. That smile on your face is worth more than money can buy and perhaps your bank account has seen the last of overdraft days. As you drive down the road, with windows down, a nostalgic song comes on the radio, and it's like you've heard music for the first time..\n\nThat feeling when you are finally recovering from opiate withdrawal..\n\n\nBest wishes opi fam!! We all deserve it. Remember that. üíó",

A dangerous guy for sure but always nice to me, a 25 year old punk rocker junkie. When i finally went to rehab we \"broke up\". He gave me a bunch of free shit and i told him i wasnt gonna be able to talk to him anymore. It was way sadder than i thought it was gonna be. I go through rehab get my shit back together living life. As im walking down a busy road years later i hear \" yo what the fuck you doing\". I turn around its my old dealer, blocking traffic to talk to me. I said nothing man im clean going to work. He looked at me and said \"keep it that way\" gave me a smile and drove off. I was so afraid that He was gonna offer me drugs, but i truly feel he cared about me enough not to. Ill never forget that moment and wish i could talk to him again someday even though i never can. At that point in my life i needed someone to believe in me. Funny where it came from though.",

If you asked me where I thought I would be 1 year later I would honestly have said dead and meant it. Well, 1 Year later, I have accomplished more things that make me happy then I have in my lifetime before I got clean. Most people like to go to material objects as a way to measure success, but in the past year I have found self worth more valuable then all the money in the world. My family trusts me again, I talk to my Grandma everyday (Today is also her birthday), I've started making music, and I built a house with my own hands for my wife, daughter and I. While I have yet to re-acquire  the disgusting amounts of money I've wasted over the past years I can honestly say I have never been happier.  I know 2020 was a shit show for aloooooot of people, but it was the best year I have had in a loooooonnnng long time. Before I got clean I would lurk on this sub and see people post about clean time or relapsing and it helped me more then I could express, to see people out there just doing their best.

    "selftext": "As the title says, I‚Äôm 100 days clean today after a CT withdrawal off morphine and fent. Never injected, snorted or smoked my DOC. But was hopelessly addicted for nearly 20 years. \n\nI was somewhat of a functioning addict. But if these last 100 days have taught me anything, it‚Äôs how sick I was. How dependent I was. And how broken I was. \n\nI feel a million times better. I‚Äôve gained some weight which I don‚Äôt love but whatever. My sleep patterns are slightly better than they were. My tummy isn‚Äôt upset every single day anymore. I don‚Äôt mindlessly pick at my fingernails until they bleed anymore because my anxiety and stress of hiding my life was so much. \n\nNobody knew. Next to nobody. I lied and betrayed and used. I was never ever proud of a single thing I‚Äôve done as it all felt like a farce to me. I did it because....I had pills. If I didn‚Äôt, if be sick. The drugs gave me the false confidence and ‚Äòenergy‚Äô I thought I needed. Really, they just drug me down in horrible ways. \n\nI don‚Äôt have a recovery team or group or anything. Only because I still haven‚Äôt been honest with the people in my life as I‚Äôm too ashamed. But, never ever ever did I think I could get 100 days under my belt. \n\nI have zero desire to go backwards. I thought and imagined and begged the world to please get me to a point where I could walk away. I thought it was impossible. It wasn‚Äôt. I did need help for the first week while I went thru the worst of withdrawal. \n\nBut I made it and I‚Äôm really really proud of myself. \n\nHere is to 100 more. And I hope anyone who might be reading this can draw some strength and inspiration from my experience. What helped me the most in those early weeks was the support of others on this sub and similar ones, who knew what I was going through, cheered me on and checked on me. \n\nThere is more than one way to achieve recovery. It is hard. No matter what. But I used to think in order to get clean I needed to go away from my family for a month or 3 months. That wasn‚Äôt the case. I did it living my same every day life. Just not using. While I‚Äôm not promoting this idea to be the ideal, I am sure that there are others out there, in so deep, that want out and think rehab is the only way to stop. \n\nIt wasn‚Äôt the only way for me. I was able to choose to stop using. Suffer like a mofo for a few weeks and keep on trucking. \n\nAnd here I am. 100 days. I could cry I‚Äôm so freaking proud of that number. I will never go backwards. I will continue to move forward. \n\nCheers to you all. Thanks for reading.",

    "selftext": "Things like cannabis, caffeine and alcohol are not the gateways. Things like molestation, childhood abuse, neglect and TRAUMA are the real gateways. These things manifest into addiction, hyper sexuality, violent tendencies, self harm etc. All of these things are the SYMPTOMS not the cause of a much larger issue. All of these manifestations stem from some sort of emotional trauma or childhood abuse. This is why traditional 30 day rehabs and medications don't typically work. We need to get to the root cause of the trauma that leads so many to look outside of themselves for relief from SELF.\n\nAddiction is manifested in any behavior that brings temporary relief or pleasure yet causes negative consequences. This behavior is then difficulty to give up. We need to realize that addiction is not a CHOICE, addiction is not an inherited disease. Addiction is a physiological and psychological response to a painful life experience. \n\nI think so many can agree, if able to put their egos aside, that many people have dealt with some sort of traumatic experience. Maybe not as extreme as something like sexual assault, but maybe growing up in a toxic household around parents who yelled and were always stressed or even depressed. Trauma doesnt have to be so significant it can be anything that our bodies/minds (especially when children) cannot comprehend or process. These past experiences subconsciously manifest in creating barriers or walls to protect ourselves. When we become adults they really reek havoc and manifest in all types of issues as noted above. I'm sure many of us can also agree we have at one time or another had some sort of addiction behavior whether it be, overworking, shopping, unhealthy/over eating, gambling, sex, drama, codependent relationships, etc.. We need to come together and stop judging one another. We need to stop bandaging our issues and get to the root cause, the root trauma and reach out for help when needed. This is a sign of strength not weakness. Trauma can also store in our physical bodies which can also manifest into sickness and disease, making us more at risk for cancers and things like autoimmune disease.\n\nTRAUMA is the real gateway.",

    "title": "Just reflecting on drug usage",
    "selftext": "I think what non-addicts fail to realize is that drugs or alcohol work really well in the beginning for addicts. I remember my first few times doing oxy, I was able to get to class on time, social interactions felt less forced, it was easier to wake up in the morning and get going, school work was easier, depression and anxiety were gone, and a bunch of other positive effects. But as we all know, eventually you feel like you are treading water and it keeps getting harder and harder to keep your head above the water. It takes longer for some than others, and some people do dive head first into oblivion after first usage, but for me personally and many addicts I‚Äôve spoken to, it begins as a very functional relationship. \n\n\nI have 2 years clean from opioids, but about a year in I used Xanax for a brief period. Same thing: work interactions were easier, cold calls were so easy, everyone loved me and I loved talking to people. Life felt easy and it felt like I was on a super drug. I should‚Äôve known better because of my history but I was shooting for productivity and Xanax was providing that. It was a quick crash and burn. \n\n\nI find it really interesting how other people view drug addiction, hell before I was a drug addict I probably viewed it the same. Unfortunately drugs work really well until they don‚Äôt, and then you are hooked on them and you are fucked anyways. But my first few times doing oxy, heroin, Xanax, cocaine, etc. wasn‚Äôt underwhelming necessarily but it was kind of like oh this is pretty manageable. With oxy it was the best feeling I‚Äôd ever had, but I wasn‚Äôt nodding out, I wasn‚Äôt drooling on myself, no one even knew that I had taken it. That was what really fucked me, I figured these drugs would be so good that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to handle doing them that much, almost like shrooms or something. I mean I knew they were addictive, but once I took them I was like oh shit this is super functional and can enhance my life.\n\nI think the theme here is, I was always looking for that something extra. Something to make life easier, that Superman pill, social lubricant, a performance enhancer if you will, a way of dulling the sharp edges of life, easing nerves, boosting confidence, a way to basically not feel like myself but an ‚Äúenhanced version‚Äù of myself. It provided me with an optimistic indifference that allowed me to separate myself from being tied to the final results of situations, events, school/work performance, etc. \n\nWhat has been the biggest asset in my recovery is learning how to take a step back and assess how I may be feeling that I‚Äôm not adequate, and then making the necessary changes to address those issues. I am enough as just myself. But not just because I say that that and it manifests in me, I am actively working to improve all of those deficiencies each day and each obstacle is a learning experience. We can‚Äôt feel great all of the time, and we can‚Äôt always control how we are going to be feeling by popping a pill or doing a drug, and that‚Äôs OK. Growth comes when we don‚Äôt want to do something, maybe we aren‚Äôt feeling particularly good that day, don‚Äôt want to go out and see/talk to people, have a lot of anxiety or nerves about something, and we get out and do our best anyways. And usually, it goes better than we expected. If it doesn‚Äôt, we can take a step back and figure out how to be better next time",

    "title": "What I want others to know about addiction after losing my brother",
    "selftext": "My brother Adam died at the age of 23 years old in 2018. He lost the battle to addiction after seven years of being a drug addict.\n\nAdam had the best laugh. It was loud & boisterous. He was tall, handsome, daring and charming. Eight years my junior, I grew up watching him come into his own. I remember him putting on magic shows in the living room. One time, he wanted to hold my hand on the roller coaster when he was scared. Adam wanted reassurance that he wasn‚Äôt too old for that. As any big sister would, I told him of course it was okay.\n\nAs time went on, I grew to be the worrier of the family. Adam grew up to be a total daredevil. Jumping off the Stratosphere in Vegas, flying a hot air balloon with my Dad, and living his life in the fast lane.\n\nMy brother was the kind of guy that grabbed life by the horns and stared fear in the face with a smirk. I used to think of him as a cat with many lives because no matter what happened, he always came out of the situation unscathed.\n\nHe became a drug addict slowly, but with warning signs. In the end, it seemed like he was overdosing every other day. The calls from rehabs and hospitals were relentless. The year before he died, my parents got a call from California encouraging us all to fly out there. He overdosed and his numbers were horrible. In this dark time, we all prepared to say goodbye to him. Miraculously, he landed on his feet yet again.\n\nThis time the overdose had consequences. He passed out on his hands and this caused serious nerve damage. He couldn‚Äôt use his hands for a while, but with his first hand surgery he acclimated quite well. The doctors said his hands wouldn‚Äôt recover and that the damage was permanent.  After about six months, he started to get movement back in his hand and to our surprise, were told he‚Äôd make a full recovery. I remember him sending me a video of him moving his hands. I sat there in awe, crying happy tears.\n\nSurely, this will all make him wake up and stop using, I thought. I hoped. In times like this, hope is the only thing that really gets you through. Every time something catastrophic happened, this was my mindset.\n\nWe never quite got the whole story, but I knew things weren‚Äôt looking good. He seemed to be spinning faster towards danger and I felt angry that there wasn‚Äôt a damn thing I could do to stop it.\n\nIn the year or so before he passed away, my friend Kate who had lost her Dad to alcoholism, told me to prepare myself for the worst. She said she had wished she accepted the fact that he could die before it happened. Maybe, just maybe, if I could do that, it would help me in the long run. I reluctantly took her advice. I sat down in my office and really thought about what she said. I cried for what felt like forever.\n\nThis harsh but valuable insight from my dear friend helped me beyond words. Every time I saw my brother, I acted as if it could be the last time. This has brought me a great amount of peace looking back on things. I don‚Äôt have regrets of what I could have done, because I know for sure I tried everything. Tough love, soft love and everything in between.\nOf course, none of it worked so there is a part of me that feels defeated. Who am I to impart any wisdom on others?\n\nThere is great peace in being able to look back on things with a clear conscience. I never looked at addiction through rose colored glasses. I saw it exactly for what it was no matter how difficult it was. I remember begging on the phone to his rehab not to let him out because I was worried he‚Äôd overdose and die. I was told there was nothing they can do to keep him there. It was his choice to leave. I‚Äôd be on the phone from morning to night fighting for answers.\n\nI spent hours talking to him about his addiction, trying to understand it and help him in any way I could. I suggested everything I could possibly think of and was there for him anytime he called me. I‚Äôd take his calls even when I suspected he was high. Sometimes he‚Äôd make no sense and ask for money. Other times, the Adam I knew and loved was just calling to say hi. I never missed one of those calls.\n\nMost importantly, I spent as much time as possible with him and always hugged him extra tight before I left. I told him how much I loved him and cherished every second. If I had not done this, I know for sure I‚Äôd look back with regret.\n\nSomething I wasn‚Äôt prepared for was how permanent death is.\n\nHe flew home from rehab in California and I saw him the day before he died. He was back in town to get surgery on his other hand. I remember him standing in the driveway on my way out. I told him again for the millionth time not to use, especially before or after his surgery. He agreed not to and I told him I loved him. We hugged and I got into my car. That was the last time I saw my brother.\n\nI wanted to write this open letter to anyone that will read it. To those who are suffering with addiction and the families around them, please know that you are not alone. I grew up in the middle class. We had a nice house on a cul-de-sac. We were taught to love each other. No one would have expected what was going on in our lives.\n\nI want to share a few words of wisdom I have learned along the way. Take it as you will.\nTo those of you in the beginning stages of grief‚Ä¶ hold on. I know you feel like you‚Äôre drowning and can‚Äôt catch your breath. You will breathe again, I promise. In the beginning, my family took everything ten seconds at a time. I cried for months in grocery store lines. There were long periods of time where I woke up crying and I went to bed crying. I could hardly catch my breath.\n\nPlease, hang on. We had an outreach of support from friends and family in the darkest time of our lives. I encourage you to reach out to those that love you and let them take care of you when you need it.\n\nCry your eyes out. I used to hate crying until I realized how healing it is. Let‚Äôs be honest, I still hate it, but I can recognize its undeniable benefits. To process grief, you have to feel the emotions behind it. I promise, you won‚Äôt cry forever. Crying is good for you and is so incredibly tiring. Cry yourself to sleep, bring tissues everywhere you go and allow yourself to feel whatever it is you‚Äôre feeling in the moment.\n\nTo anyone suffering with addiction, please know you are loved and you are not alone. I want you to know that losing a family member to this is the hardest thing I‚Äôve ever had to do. It‚Äôs been a year and a half, and I still cry every single day. Please, do everything you can to take the addiction seriously and to get support in any way you can.\n\nAddiction is something a person is suffering with. It does not define who they are. It‚Äôs easy to judge an addict until you have walked the same path. Offer kindness and love to the addict instead of judgment. That addict is someone‚Äôs family member or best friend. All I‚Äôm saying is, love goes a lot farther than judgment. As humans, we are all suffering in some way. It makes the world a much better place to offer encouragement, love, and understanding to a person.\n\nTo families and friends of addicts, I see you. I know how painful and hard it is to watch someone you love go further down the rabbit hole. It‚Äôs a hopeless, devastating feeling I wouldn‚Äôt wish on anyone. I try to openly share my story with others. You would not believe the amount of people who are dealing with the exact same thing. We feel like we need to hide in the shadows because it‚Äôs embarrassing to discuss. Trust me, I get it. Please remember, none of us choose this. It‚Äôs something that unfortunately happens way more than it should.\n\nTo those reading this, thank you for taking the time to listen to what I have to say. I miss my brother every single second of every single day. Sometimes, when I close my eyes, I can still hear his laugh. On the really tough days, that gets me through.\n\nAnd to my brother Adam; fly high. I will never forget you.\n\n- Allison",

    "selftext": "As the title says, 8 years, and I feel the need to post on here. I was reading an article today about many who are still in active addiction who are facing a new threat of their Heroin being cut with Xylazine. They develop huge, black, crusty sores and many are losing their limbs to amputation because of it. It is truly scary. \n\nI can‚Äôt begin to say how thankful I am for my sobriety. After a 20 year active addiction to pills (to begin with,) and then heroin, I reached my rock bottom and was able to get clean. I never had a single relapse. Suboxone saved my life. \n\nI‚Äôm here to tell others out there who are waking up today wondering how they‚Äôre going to keep from getting dope sick, how they‚Äôre going to come up with the money today to pay their dope connection, that there is a way out of the vicious cycle you‚Äôre in. I promise you there is. But you HAVE TO WANT IT. You HAVE to be ready to get clean. Thankfully my rock bottom came before I OD,d‚Ä¶I hope yours does too!\n\nFor me, rock bottom was 45 days in jail for shoplifting. I boosted from big box stores and sold my loot at local flea markets to pay for my $300/day addiction. \n\nThe day I walked into a local Suboxone clinic, I was wearing TWO Fentanyl patches and going through about a bundle a day. That day I made a promise to myself that I‚Äôd never touch Opioids again. I attended IOP (intensive outpatient treatment) 4 days a week, 3 hours a day with DAILY urine screenings for the first 6 months. I took the Suboxone EXACTLY as prescribed and never, NOT ONCE, sold a single one, despite dozens, if not hundreds of requests to do so. I‚Äôve been clean ever since.\n\nI can estimate that I spent approximately $2.9 million,$400/day, in 22 years on drugs (pills and heroin.)\n\nToday, I can brag that I have never been better. I‚Äôve worked my same job for the past 8 years and I love my job! My wife and I have two checking accounts AND a savings account. We have over 2k in each checking account and 12k+ in the savings account. That wouldn‚Äôt have been possible in active addiction. It‚Äôs not a lot of money but we‚Äôre not living paycheck to paycheck. \n\nIf any of you reading this are having a rough day or are feeling triggered, PLEASE, feel free to message me‚Ä¶we‚Äôll talk. I‚Äôm here for all of you. I hope, if not anything else, that I can at least offer a little motivation to even one person to seek help, that would make my day!",

    "title": "What I want others to know about addiction after losing my brother",
    "selftext": "My brother Adam died at the age of 23 years old in 2018. He lost the battle to addiction after seven years of being a drug addict.\n\nAdam had the best laugh. It was loud & boisterous. He was tall, handsome, daring and charming. Eight years my junior, I grew up watching him come into his own. I remember him putting on magic shows in the living room. One time, he wanted to hold my hand on the roller coaster when he was scared. Adam wanted reassurance that he wasn‚Äôt too old for that. As any big sister would, I told him of course it was okay.\n\nAs time went on, I grew to be the worrier of the family. Adam grew up to be a total daredevil. Jumping off the Stratosphere in Vegas, flying a hot air balloon with my Dad, and living his life in the fast lane.\n\nMy brother was the kind of guy that grabbed life by the horns and stared fear in the face with a smirk. I used to think of him as a cat with many lives because no matter what happened, he always came out of the situation unscathed.\n\nHe became a drug addict slowly, but with warning signs. In the end, it seemed like he was overdosing every other day. The calls from rehabs and hospitals were relentless. The year before he died, my parents got a call from California encouraging us all to fly out there. He overdosed and his numbers were horrible. In this dark time, we all prepared to say goodbye to him. Miraculously, he landed on his feet yet again.\n\nThis time the overdose had consequences. He passed out on his hands and this caused serious nerve damage. He couldn‚Äôt use his hands for a while, but with his first hand surgery he acclimated quite well. The doctors said his hands wouldn‚Äôt recover and that the damage was permanent.  After about six months, he started to get movement back in his hand and to our surprise, were told he‚Äôd make a full recovery. I remember him sending me a video of him moving his hands. I sat there in awe, crying happy tears.\n\nSurely, this will all make him wake up and stop using, I thought. I hoped. In times like this, hope is the only thing that really gets you through. Every time something catastrophic happened, this was my mindset.\n\nWe never quite got the whole story, but I knew things weren‚Äôt looking good. He seemed to be spinning faster towards danger and I felt angry that there wasn‚Äôt a damn thing I could do to stop it.\n\nIn the year or so before he passed away, my friend Kate who had lost her Dad to alcoholism, told me to prepare myself for the worst. She said she had wished she accepted the fact that he could die before it happened. Maybe, just maybe, if I could do that, it would help me in the long run. I reluctantly took her advice. I sat down in my office and really thought about what she said. I cried for what felt like forever.\n\nThis harsh but valuable insight from my dear friend helped me beyond words. Every time I saw my brother, I acted as if it could be the last time. This has brought me a great amount of peace looking back on things. I don‚Äôt have regrets of what I could have done, because I know for sure I tried everything. Tough love, soft love and everything in between.\nOf course, none of it worked so there is a part of me that feels defeated. Who am I to impart any wisdom on others?\n\nThere is great peace in being able to look back on things with a clear conscience. I never looked at addiction through rose colored glasses. I saw it exactly for what it was no matter how difficult it was. I remember begging on the phone to his rehab not to let him out because I was worried he‚Äôd overdose and die. I was told there was nothing they can do to keep him there. It was his choice to leave. I‚Äôd be on the phone from morning to night fighting for answers.\n\nI spent hours talking to him about his addiction, trying to understand it and help him in any way I could. I suggested everything I could possibly think of and was there for him anytime he called me. I‚Äôd take his calls even when I suspected he was high. Sometimes he‚Äôd make no sense and ask for money. Other times, the Adam I knew and loved was just calling to say hi. I never missed one of those calls.\n\nMost importantly, I spent as much time as possible with him and always hugged him extra tight before I left. I told him how much I loved him and cherished every second. If I had not done this, I know for sure I‚Äôd look back with regret.\n\nSomething I wasn‚Äôt prepared for was how permanent death is.\n\nHe flew home from rehab in California and I saw him the day before he died. He was back in town to get surgery on his other hand. I remember him standing in the driveway on my way out. I told him again for the millionth time not to use, especially before or after his surgery. He agreed not to and I told him I loved him. We hugged and I got into my car. That was the last time I saw my brother.\n\nI wanted to write this open letter to anyone that will read it. To those who are suffering with addiction and the families around them, please know that you are not alone. I grew up in the middle class. We had a nice house on a cul-de-sac. We were taught to love each other. No one would have expected what was going on in our lives.\n\nI want to share a few words of wisdom I have learned along the way. Take it as you will.\nTo those of you in the beginning stages of grief‚Ä¶ hold on. I know you feel like you‚Äôre drowning and can‚Äôt catch your breath. You will breathe again, I promise. In the beginning, my family took everything ten seconds at a time. I cried for months in grocery store lines. There were long periods of time where I woke up crying and I went to bed crying. I could hardly catch my breath.\n\nPlease, hang on. We had an outreach of support from friends and family in the darkest time of our lives. I encourage you to reach out to those that love you and let them take care of you when you need it.\n\nCry your eyes out. I used to hate crying until I realized how healing it is. Let‚Äôs be honest, I still hate it, but I can recognize its undeniable benefits. To process grief, you have to feel the emotions behind it. I promise, you won‚Äôt cry forever. Crying is good for you and is so incredibly tiring. Cry yourself to sleep, bring tissues everywhere you go and allow yourself to feel whatever it is you‚Äôre feeling in the moment.\n\nTo anyone suffering with addiction, please know you are loved and you are not alone. I want you to know that losing a family member to this is the hardest thing I‚Äôve ever had to do. It‚Äôs been a year and a half, and I still cry every single day. Please, do everything you can to take the addiction seriously and to get support in any way you can.\n\nAddiction is something a person is suffering with. It does not define who they are. It‚Äôs easy to judge an addict until you have walked the same path. Offer kindness and love to the addict instead of judgment. That addict is someone‚Äôs family member or best friend. All I‚Äôm saying is, love goes a lot farther than judgment. As humans, we are all suffering in some way. It makes the world a much better place to offer encouragement, love, and understanding to a person.\n\nTo families and friends of addicts, I see you. I know how painful and hard it is to watch someone you love go further down the rabbit hole. It‚Äôs a hopeless, devastating feeling I wouldn‚Äôt wish on anyone. I try to openly share my story with others. You would not believe the amount of people who are dealing with the exact same thing. We feel like we need to hide in the shadows because it‚Äôs embarrassing to discuss. Trust me, I get it. Please remember, none of us choose this. It‚Äôs something that unfortunately happens way more than it should.\n\nTo those reading this, thank you for taking the time to listen to what I have to say. I miss my brother every single second of every single day. Sometimes, when I close my eyes, I can still hear his laugh. On the really tough days, that gets me through.\nAnd to my brother Adam; fly high. I will never forget you.\n\n- Allison Sica",

    "selftext": "I was an active opiate user from 2005-2019. In that time, I did every drug imaginable and some pretty terrible shit to undeserving people. \n\nPutting my life back together has truly been a \"one day at a time\" journey. And we are each of us at different places. We all sunk to varying depths, we all rise to varying heights...but at my lowest, I would frequently steal whatever pills I could get my hands on. \n\nI stole painkillers from Grandpa who was battling cancer. I stole Adderall from my sister who suffers in her own ways. I stole Oxy from my mom's bathrooms after one of her surgeries. And while I would always come clean, I could never stop myself in the moment. \n\nThis morning my dad took a pretty serious fall. He's at the hospital overnight and when I went to his house to get some overnight stuff for him, there on his computer desk was a bottle of OxyContin 5s. Looked like probably 20-30 pills in there. \n\nIt's the first time I have actually seen any pills in almost 5 years. I have avoided them like the plague, I cut every social tie I had, and so on. So today was the first real temptation in all that time. \n\nAnd I am so proud of myself for not touching them. The thought was there. The impulse, even after nearly 5 years, was still there...but today, I said \"No. This is behind you. This is beneath you.\" \n\nAnd I walked out with his phone and charger and that's it. \n\nIt's a weird thing to be proud of oneself for not stealing drugs from a family member... but, I don't care. That was a major victory for me, for my willpower, for my sobriety, for my sanity, for my life. \n\nI hope everyone here gets to experience that for themselves someday. Taking back your life, one choice, one decision at a time.\n\nBe easy. Be well. Believe in yourself.",

Lucky in trying to defend myself I was only stabbed through my arms, hand sliced and neck slightly cut. All in all, I was fine.\n\nBefore I even got into the ambulance I told the people I do not want any opiate relief and told them my situation of being clean off heroin for 1.5 years. They appreciated the honesty and said if I wanted they could give me IV Fentanyl. (Yes, I was definitely fucking tempted) but refused as I wasn‚Äôt in much pain.\n\nGot to the hospital and went to sleep. I awoke in a lot of pain and had a chat with one of the doctors who pretty much told me that he appreciates me trying to be strong in recovery but the meds are here for situations like I am in and I obviously cannot abuse them as I‚Äôm in a hospital situation. He also promised not to send me home with any take homes and not have me on them for longer than 24 hours. \n\nWell that‚Äôs pretty much it. 20mg of oxy was consumed yesterday. I tell you what, there is something about taking oxy after being stabbed 7 times that takes the fun and recreational value out of it. I spoke to my girlfriend about it today and said ‚ÄúI think the reason I loved it so much before was because I was a broken man‚Äù. I think I grown past that time in my life, but the whole one more time was good because it made me realise it‚Äôs not that good. \n\nI love you all, life is precious.

I was fucking terrified and sick in my bones and my guts and I wanted to get high, and I didn‚Äôt get high.\n\nThe prospect of 5 years of consciousness would have scared the shit out of 2014 me.

He messaged my husband out of the blue one day in late February and they started hanging out. They both relapsed on April. My husband would be out for hours at his place. I wouldn‚Äôt even know what was going on. I noticed he changed but not that he relapsed. Just that he started to hang out with him more and more. I begged him to stay home with me as I am 5 months pregnant with our first child, a baby girl. I am also a recovering addict‚Ä¶sober for 8 months. \n\nI started to notice his behavior‚Ä¶ nodding and itching two days before he died.

So‚Ä¶ after he passed away‚Ä¶ I confronted that ‚Äúfriend‚Äù and he said my husband overdosed 4 times within 2 weeks. I was in disbelief, shock and angry.

    "title": "I Just Lost Both of My Younger Brothers.",
    "selftext": "On May 6, I received the unbearable news that both of my younger brothers, 29 and 31, have passed away due to their drug usage.\n\nI spoke with my brother 31 every single day via Facebook Messenger. He last messaged me / \"saw\" my messages on the morning of April 26, and never responded or \"saw\" another message again. Between April 26 and May 5, I started to get really angry. It was pretty typical of my brothers to not respond to messages (they only communicated via FB and did not own cellphones) and it was always impossible to plan events or anything like that with them. They were endlessly unpredictable and impossible to communicate with and get a hold of. Usually, when they went \"dark\" like this, is meant they were using. However, I didn't really suspect anything. I was just insanely frustrated as my Dad and I were trying to get ahold of them to plan a BBQ for my mother for today, Mother's Day. After not hearing anything for several days, I told my boyfriend that I would have to go the ballistic route which I had employed a couple times in the past and just drive over to their apartment and knock on the door. I basically said to him if they didn't respond to me by the end of the night on May 5, I would just go over there. I am really glad I didn't.\n\nThe thing is - our family had been led to believe that both these boys had been clean for about 2 years. My brother 31 had recently completed suboxone treatment. Last summer, our family had a big BBQ party to celebrate his first year of sobriety and I won't lie, it was one of the most fun and happiest days of my entire life. After years and years of pain and suffering and worry caused by my brother's lifestyle, I finally felt as though we were out of the woods, our family was going to be a complete family again, and my parents and I finally let our guards down. Why would we have to keep them up anyway? Both our boys were clean, and swore they'd never go back.\n\nAnyway. During the period between April 26 and May 6, I definitely had the thought that they might be using again, because it had been quite a while since the last time I had experienced a lack of response from my brothers. We talked every single night to discuss that evening's episode of TimCast IRL, or the Tim Dillon Podcast (among many other podcasts), or the rise of DOGEcoin, or music, or happenings in the world. I was pissed off the first night he didn't answer me. I was worried by the second night. I noticed that he hadn't been on FB in a while and that was not normal for him as he was ALWAYS on FB. My first thought was, \"hey, maybe they finally found a job!\" My brothers (who lived and worked together - they did literally every thing on Earth together) had been out of work since the very start of the pandemic, and had been trying to get back to it. I got to enjoy that thought for about a day. I realized the next day that there's no way they wouldn't have told me if they had gotten a job, and if they didn't tell me, surely my Mom would have. We were very invested in their health, recovery, and day-to-day lives. But still our guards were down. After like 15 years of true and honest to God chaos, we had finally let our guards down. I started to wonder if they were using, because they hadn't answered me or my Dad. I started to get very angry.\n\nI suppose my parents must have also had a premonition, because on the morning of May 6, they decided to drive over to their apartment. The window to their 3rd story apartment was open, and they yelled and yelled up to it (we didn't have any other way of entering). My Dad told me that he already knew before they started yelling. They called the police, and sure enough, both of my brothers were located deceased in their beds in the apartment. Their bodies were badly decomposed as they had been lying there since April 27 - over a fucking week.\n\nI will not try to describe to you what receiving that phone call was like. I was having a great morning at home - working, as I've been working at home since March 2020, doing some chit chat with my friends online. I booked my vaccine appointment for my boyfriend and I (which I had texted my Mom about earlier, when she was in the car on the way to the apartment). Then at about noon, my Dad called. Somehow I already knew what that call was going to be. But I will never, for the entire rest of my life get it out of my head,\n\n\"SurvivalistTales . . . 31 and 29 are dead.\"\n\nAnd here I am now on May 9, Mother's Day, the day we were all supposed to be together laughing and enjoying and celebrating our dear mother, with my life in utter fucking ruins, without the two people I love more than life itself. My parents suffering the most excruciating pain that a parent can know, and believe it or not, they have not lost 2 but now 3 sons in their lives. We had an older brother that died as a child to leukemia. Now they have lost all their sons. The worst thing a parent can ever endure has now struck again, as they lost two fucking more.\n\nI won't go on and on about the unbearable pain, the insane loss of both my brothers, my family, and how I cannot imagine how I am going to live in this world without them. But I will go on about the following:\n\nThe medical examiner's provided us with interesting information about brother 31. He was found with a lighter in one hand, and a rolled up scratch ticket in the other. I am extremely innocent with regards to drugs, and I have no clue what that would have been, but we won't receive a toxicology report for at least 6 months, apparently. They said that he died instantly, because the autopsy revealed that he was actually already in the process of dying a slow death due to a severely enlarged heart. They said the enlarged heart was caused by extensive drug usage, likely cocaine. But I have since learned from his friends after his passing that he consumed all sorts of drugs I never imagined: meth, crack, cocaine, ketamine, GHB, heroin, and I have learned that he specifically sought out fentanyl. Our family was always led to believe that he was \"only addicted to heroin\" and I dunno, somehow that made it better. I won't be passing this extra information on to my parents. But the sad thing is, no matter if he had truly been clean, we were about to lose him anyway. The drugs had already ravished his body to such a point. His liver was also failing. He was not aware of either of these things.\n\nThe medical examiners would not provide us with details about brother 29's death. While they went into detail about 31, they were not so forthcoming with 29. I've received a couple of messages from their friends asking me whether or not they died simultaneously, or if 31 passed and 29 discovered his body and decided to take his own life. I think their intuition is correct. Their friends told me that the boys had a \"system\" for their drug usage, where one would watch the other consume their drug and wait before proceeding with using it themselves. Considering that 31 died instantly, I am unfortunately led to believe that this is likely the case. And if you knew these boys, you'd know that there was simply no way, no version of reality, in which one could live without the other. They were cosmically linked. I can live without them, as unimaginable as it sounds, but there's simply no way that they could live without each other. Sadly, our family doesn't get to hang on to the quiet comfort of knowing that they both passed at the same time. We now have to accept the possible horrible reality that 29 had to endure the worst imaginable pain, and had to decide to end his life instead of endure it. How fucking ridiculous. **Edit: for anyone in the future reading this: it has since been confirmed that 29 did not take his own life. I met with the police and they stated that they didn't provide details on 29 as it was \". . . very hard to identify him.\" The police assured me that it was an accident, he did not take his life, and to put that narrative to rest. I am putting it to rest.\"**\n\nI am writing this because the pain is very fresh, and I feel fucking weird in this new world where I exist and my beloved, wonderful, blessed brothers do not. There is nothing that is ever going to make this okay. I feel rage, resentment, helpless, confused, and a sorrow that I could never have imagined. I can hardly even think about what my parents must feel. But I want you to know that it is NOT SAFE for you to consume these drugs. You may think you are safe after 2 years, but YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT DAMAGE YOUR BODY HAS ALREADY SUSTAINED. There is no safe way to do this. It is NOT worth it. Nothing on Earth will ever be worth it. Think of this family of 5 now widdled down to 3 and how we are supposed to exist for the whole rest of our broken lives. Is it worth it?\n\nI won't claim to understand addiction. I have no fucking clue. I spent most of my life feeling resentful and at times even kind of scared of my brothers for their addiction. It just made no sense. We were a happy family and came from a prosperous, stable, supportive home. Our parents are fun and happy people who gave us a good life. We suffered no amount of dysfunction or abuse or like, anything bad. I'm so fucking innocent even at 33 years old - I've never even lost someone until now. But I assure you, I have now lost all remaining innocence, and I'd give literally anything to have it all back.\n\nDon't do it. Don't do it. Please, don't do it. If you want reasons why not to, just imagine your mother and father on their knees on the floor screaming in pain. Imagine the police finding your 10 day old decaying body lying in your bed in your apartment with your dead brother who took his own life in the other room. Imagine your cat trapped in the apartment with you, for 10 days with her owners dead and likely without access to any food (imagine) or water. Imagine that your sister will never ever ever ever get her imagined versions of these images out of her head. Every time I close my eyes, I see it. I didn't even see it, and I am so thankful neither my parents and I did, but it doesn't mean it's not there in our imaginations.\n\nIf you or anyone here needs to talk or anything - message me. I am dedicating the rest of my life to addiction awareness and advocacy. I've learned now that my brothers were never clean of drugs. I don't know how I can ever forgive them.\n\n[Long may you run, my boys. Enjoy the great gig in the sky. At least you truly will be together forever.](https://imgur.com/a/unasmak)",

    "selftext": "It's been 5 years since I was laying in detox in the hospital in a paper suit throwing up, shitting, sweating and wondering if getting clean is really worth it. It's been 5 years and I still miss getting high and the chase of getting drugs but I know the consequences to going back. The memories I miss are attached to the people that I've lost in my 10 years of active addiction and the people I've lost who thought getting clean wasn't worth it and went back out. The close friends that I've lost to dope weather it was from over dose, jail, robberies gone wrong these are the people that I do this for. I have goals for the future finally, I'm seeing my life years down the line not expecting to be dead before then. My family is proud of me, my friends are proud of me and im sure the friends I've lost are proud of me. Getting clean didn't solve my problems, it didn't instantly change my life, it wasn't easy and it definitely wasn't fun but it has been worth it. We can do more to help the people still in active addiction by staying alive and staying clean. The next time you're asking yourself if it's worth it think of the friends you've lost to the drugs, the family members, the parts of yourself and you'll realize it is. Here's to 5 more!",

    "selftext": "Today i am one year sober. \n\nHonestly, i never thought i would make it this far. I didnt want to get sober when i was using, the thought never crossed my mind. I got sober because i got really sick with MRSA, had abscesses in both lungs and my knee. I called my father for help and when he broke down crying, so did i. I got clean that day and went to the hospital, where i spent 3 months fighting death. I won. I had to use a walker for 6 months, couldnt breathe on my own, and still struggle but hey, im alive. \n\nMy addiction really took off when i was a victim of  human traffiking in 2018. I was held against my will until april 2019. I was let go because we had gotten evicted from where we were staying, i was dying and they didnt want a dead body on their hands. At first i stayed their a friend of theirs, who forced me to clean his entire house and screamed at me when i couldnt because i literally couldnt walk. I was called lazy, a liar, threatened to get beat up. This situation was actually better for me because at least i wasnt actually getting beat. I told my abuser that my dad was getting me a room, which he was, but instead of having men over, i cried the entire 2 nights i had it and when i wasnt picked up in the morning, i called my dad and went to the ER. \n\nI always look back and hate myself for not running. But i was terrified. I had stockholm syndrome and thought this person cared about me too. They were very manipulative and i had told them my past, which is how they were able to gain my trust thru a soft spot. I didnt get snatched out of a parking lot or anything dramatic. This person posed as a caring friend, a best friend, and that was something i was lacking after my divorce. They went from the friendly person, feeding me drugs, to extremely abusive, beating on me, and eventually tricking me out against my will. \n\nIve been in therapy for a few months now. I fought it for so long because honestly it tears me up to think about it. It took a lot to just type what i did here out, but for me, its easier to type it than say it out loud. I havent actually talked about what happened in therapy yet, i cant get past just sitting there and sobbing. Im terrified of the world, of friendships, even tho i want one so badly. Im so alone. I never leave my room. But at the same time, im also the happiest ive ever been. I get weird looks when i say that, esp from my therapist, but i hope one you know what i mean?\n\nAnyway, after a long battle with addiction, im happy that im kicking its ass. I went through almost anything you can imagine while i was using and it didnt phase me at the time because i was so numb. All the trauma and feelings are hitting me now, and im learning to cope and heal in a healthy way. Ive spent this past year apologizing to other people, but ive realized i need to start apologizing to myself. Instead of ignoring my mental illness and hating myself, i need to love and nuture myself. I was so, so broken and everyone took a piece. Im taking them back now. \n\n I used to pray to god that hed just take me and end this, i hoped every bag was my last, constantly tried to OD. And i did die, the person i was died. It sounds dramatic but it truly feels that way, like ive been reborn. Im learning and growing everyday. I hope one day i can help others in my situation. Even if its just one person, itll all be worth it.",

    "title": "Please Think Before You Give Advice",
    "selftext": "I've seen a lot of posts recently where I felt the need to apologize to OP for other user's comments. \n\nPlease remember that people are coming here looking for help. Think about all the times when you were using and you were desperate. But you had no idea where to start or what to do. \n\nI know what you're thinking: \"Well, if someone had just warned me how stupid that was and I quit while I was only taking 6 Norcos a day my life would be so much better.\" \n\nCome on. We all know no one could have told you anything. And certainly not a stranger on the internet. **Don't sit on a high horse like you would have ever listened to the advice you're giving when you were using.** \n\nI'm not saying not to say it at all. But be cognizant of the fact that someone that is struggling with an opiate addiction is reaching out, and by making a blanket statement that amounts to basically insulting them, you're only making it that much worse. And you're acting like you're better than them, whether you like it or not, when really you started in the same place. So fuck off with that. \n\nThe end result, whether you want to admit it or not, is that less people seek help. If someone asks how to taper their hydrocodone habit or if they can cold water extract it, don't jump in and tell them they need to stop right now and that's nothing and they're stupid. Again, picture yourself in their shoes. They're going to reject your \"help\". \n\nI know what you're thinking again: \"But they will get help when they're ready and only when they're ready. Then we'll be there to support that. I'm not an enabler.\"\n\n**People that are rejected when looking for advice about how to be safe might die. People that want help, but find it offputting, might die trying to find something that does work, because no one is giving them that information.**\n\nI'm not willing to be part of that. If you don't have something constructive to offer, don't fucking comment. I'm not saying not to challenge OP or to share your own experience. \n\nSomeone posting in a recovery forum clearly knows they have a problem. Maybe they're not ready to quit, but they need to know they'll be supported when they do. **Rejecting people because they're using only leads to them using more to forget you did that shit to them. This is an online forum, you don't need boundaries like you need in real life. Just don't fucking participate then.**\n\nI am asking because I see *myself* in so many of the users I've seen rejected here. I reached out multiple times and got a bunch of very similar bullshit answers. It took me years to figure out that I would have to take the bull by the horns and figure out a program that worked for me outside of a traditional program. \n\nThe truth is that traditional programs (especially 12-step) don't work for most people. It's just overrepresented because there isn't much else out there unless you have access to excellent private medical insurance and/or large amounts of cash. \n\nThat's a political conversation for another time, but I feel like a lot of times addicts are so off-put by the prolific 12-step stuff that they're afraid to ask for help. I know because that's how I felt. I gave it a chance, and I AMA. \n\nThere are plenty of posts I don't comment on because I don't have anything useful to offer. I would never, ever jump on someone celebrating a year with no substances and brag that I don't use opiates anymore but smoke weed a few nights a week. So please respect that and don't jump down someone's throat on another post asking about smoking weed. It's fine to say you don't use it and explain why, so long as you stay respectful. \n\nTL;DR: Respect each other. \n\nThoughts?",

    "selftext": "1 year ago, there i am sitting in the middle seat of the 2nd to last row on an 8am delta airlines flight from san diego to new york. to the left of me in the window seat is a ~65 year old lady smiling while reading a people magazine. to the right of me is a middle aged man sleeping soundly while taking over the entire arm rest and slightly leaning over into my space. these people seem perfectly fine where they are simply waiting for this plane to take them home. but me, i am far from fine.\n\ni‚Äôm sitting in that middle seat squirming, sweating bullets, while my body and head feel like they‚Äôre going to explode and nerves are firing from every inch of my skin. i‚Äôm exhausted but wide awake at the same time and whenever i can get my mind off of the discomfort i‚Äôm feeling, the only other thing i can think about is how much i fucked up. i haven‚Äôt eaten or slept for days and am so dehydrated but worried about drinking anything for not to puke all over this airplane.\n\njust 3 days before that flight, i was in mexico and had taken a flood dose of ibogaine in an effort to kick a multi year dope habit. the experience was difficult to say the least; couldn‚Äôt eat or sleep at all those 3 days, non stop vomiting and diarrhea, body hurt all over, and pure feelings of shame and regret. as bad as i felt though, my desire to ever touch opiates again had completely vanished, whenever i‚Äôd even think about it i would end up puking some more or dry heaving. \n\nthis sounds amazing looking back at it now, but in that moment it made me feel even more helpless because i no longer had that sense of relief to look to when shit got rough.\n\nback to the flight, the attendants start walking by to hand out refreshments. they don‚Äôt bother waking the guy to my right and when they ask me if i‚Äôd like anything to drink, i just say no despite how much i know i needed some fluids. they ask the old lady next to me if she‚Äôd like anything and she quickly says ‚Äúblack coffee please‚Äù. the smile from reading the magazine still hasn‚Äôt left her face.\n\ni watch them hand her the black coffee and see her take a first sip and let out a quiet ‚Äúahhh‚Äù of satisfaction then go back to reading the people magazine with that same damn smile. i am absolutely turning over in my seat now.\n\nhow the fuck is this old ass lady just sitting there purely content drinking mother fucking black coffee from an airplane cart reading this garbage magazine? while here i am, an otherwise healthy young man on a flight back from san diego at the start of summer, feeling like i am about to die. how is she so happy just being here drinking black coffee? will i ever be able to get there? \n\nthe following months are not easy, my whole lifestyle is transitioned and all these problems i was ignoring for so long bubbled right up to the surface. i struggle through it because that‚Äôs all i can do.\n\nfast forward to this morning, 1 year from that flight. i wake up still tired, not particularly looking forward to a day at work. i know some coffee will help wake me up. i look in the fridge and all the milk is gone so i‚Äôll just have to drink it black.\n\ni sit there drinking my coffee while reading emails. i feel myself starting to wake up more. i look outside and see the sun is shining, then i turn behind me to see my dog on the couch sleeping on his back with his paws in the air. it makes me laugh and puts a big smile on my face. i take another sip of my coffee and think to myself, this tastes just as good without milk. i go back to reading emails, but that smile hasn‚Äôt left my face. \n\ni did get there.",

    "title": "Sick days",
    "selftext": "I was just reflecting this morning on how many days I have spent sick in bed withdrawing, or unable to function because I was waiting on drugs or some dumbass that sold them. Or just the days where I could only do the bare minimum, when just showering felt like a monumental chore (I vividly remember being in so much pain that I would just sit on the floor in the shower unable to really stand anymore and let the hot water run on me, or how much dread I had getting out of the shower because my body had lost its ability to regulate temps and I would be wet, freezing, and have to get dressed). Days when I could barely handle conversation with other people because I just didn‚Äôt have much to offer and emotionally/physically I wasn‚Äôt there. I feel like I missed out on so much time. I guess when I reflect back I don‚Äôt really feel as bad about the time I wasted when I was actually high on drugs, more so the amount of time I spent obsessing over them, waiting in parking lots for late dealers, and probably the most understated aspect of drug addiction: recovery. Getting clean is a bitch of a time and towards the end it felt like I was losing a piece of myself each time I went through it and I guess that kind of is what ended up being my bottom was that I was just so sick and tired of being sick and tired ALL THE TIME.\n\n\n\nThe rinse and repeat cycle of addiction to clean to relapse to get clean again was just so exhausting. The insomnia the first few months, being hungry yet unable to stomach food, the shame and guilt of letting down friends and family again, feeling like a fish out of water those first few months of sobriety, like a true shell of myself. I was a shell of myself using and I was a shell of myself initially in sobriety, but at least sober I was able to work towards being less of a shell of myself. Gradually I was able to find things I loved doing again, enjoyed social interaction again, built healthy habits like working out and meditating. And now I feel stronger and better than ever. \n\n\n\nI guess the point of this post is that once you have a respectable amount of time clean, it is really easy for me to oversimplify things and kind of lose track of how hopeless and lost I felt at points during the entire process. Which is crazy because I know this is the tendency, yet I fall victim to it. Inside of this tendency I am also prone to looking at drug addiction and recovery separately which they were most definitely not. PAWS was always the hardest part for me because that was when I was the weakest, I had already gotten over acute WDs, and still would have a ton of shitty symptoms and not feel right and it would be a month or few months later and it just felt so much easier to stay on the path of less resistance and go back to what I knew. \n\n\n\nI guess what got me started down this tangent was I woke up at 4:30 this morning and was unable to get back to bed. This used to happen in early sobriety all the damn time, and it is such a weird time/feeling because no one else is awake, it‚Äôs too late to take a sleep med and try to salvage going back to sleep, it‚Äôs way too early to really make noise and go about your day, so you just kind of are stuck in this purgatory. You are too awake to sleep but still sort of groggy and out of it so you don‚Äôt really want to turn on the lights. It really serves as quite the metaphor for addiction and recovery for me, those moments where I didn‚Äôt think I could go on living clean or in addiction. Just kind of stuck bouncing between the two, biding time until my next run, kind of just going through the motions in both, unable to really bring myself to commit fully either way. \n\n\n\nI never really took the plunge in drug addiction. I was a heroin smoker, shot up a couple times but somehow had the foresight to know where that was headed I guess idk tbh it just never took, but I was always just kind of trying to manage, do enough to be high but not really have people notice (obviously some days better than others with this), save a little bit for later or the morning (once again varying degrees of success). But I guess my point is that I saw a lot of other people dive head first into the drug game, start selling, start shooting up, hanging out with fellow drug addicts all the time, etc. I was never like that. I had basically one guy I used with, one of my best friends, he dove in head first and OD‚Äôd by 23. The rest of that time was spent alone, no one to run with, just buy my shit and go use it by myself. That‚Äôs not to say I didn‚Äôt have friends, but once again you are kind of caught in between hiding your addiction and hanging out with friends that obviously wouldn‚Äôt want to be around that kind of shit (even unknowingly). So then you start to isolate, try to only hang out with people when I had control of the situation, I had picked up my drugs, showered, looked presentable, used enough but not too much. The problem with that is the drug game is unpredictable and I started having to flake on engagements because the conditions weren‚Äôt right, and I would isolate even more. Nobody likes to have plans cancelled on them. \n\n\nI went to rehab at 21 years old, back when I was just using oxy, it kind of ruined using for me from there on out because the lies I was telling myself had been exposed and there was obviously more going on than purely just chasing hedonistic desires. I was obviously fucked up internally and had developed horrible coping mechanisms. I had now also been exposed to true* hardcore addicts, I couldn‚Äôt keep lying to myself saying that would never be me, and I realized I had a lot more in common with them than I wanted to believe upon arrival. I was convinced that I was different, I was just using a pill, not shooting it like the junkies in the streets. The problem was that all the junkies in the streets started off the same way I did, had been where I was, and inevitably you use long enough and you are basically headed towards being a junkie on the street. I saw what I was doing to my loved ones, realized that I didn‚Äôt just like using drugs because they felt good, and knew where I was headed if I continued to use. I now knew that what I was doing was wrong, and I was headed down a very dangerous path, which was obviously not enough to impede the monkey on my back for more than a few months.\n\n\nUnfortunately, as is the theme here, it was too early for sobriety also. I was far too immature, and although I had learned a lot in rehab I had not committed enough of it to conscious thought, and was still determined to be the lucky lotto winner that could manage to use like a gentleman. I (as is another theme) would go to meetings, get a sponsor, and put in a lot of time and work on recovery, but not enough to truly get anywhere meaningful. Even though I did some good work that was meaningful, I always had one foot out the door because I knew I wasn‚Äôt going to be completely sober and I had no intention to be. I just was going to be sober as long as I had to be to feel like I had tamed the monkey, usually about 3-6 months, and then I would return to drug and alcohol usage with the exception of opiates. \n\n\n\nIt was from that point on that I was stuck in this limbo, a decade of on and off usage until opiate cessation about 2 1/2 years ago, where I would get anywhere from 3 months to even a year of clean time before I would relapse back into usage. But the cat was out of the bag already, at least for those closest to me, and they were no longer so easily convinced that I was doing fine, they knew the signs to look for now. So that even during my runs I would spend a lot of time trying to get clean, or thinking about how to get clean, which was ironic because when I was sober I was thinking about how I was gonna use. Truly stuck in limbo, a theme that if you made it this far you can tell it is the point of today‚Äôs reflection. All of this time was spent not knowing what I truly wanted, or maybe put more succinctly: not knowing what I wanted and how to get it. \n\n\nAnd if you‚Äôve made it this far, and you are in early recovery or maybe just need an extra kick in the ass, know that this all could have been prevented. We all know that we can get back friendships, even relationships, finances, objects we have pawned, jobs lost, etc. but we will not get back that time. Not just the time spent in opiated bliss (for that is, after all, what we signed up for initially), but the nights we spent unable to sleep, the beautiful spring days where we couldn‚Äôt get out of bed, the hours upon hours waiting in shitty parking lots. The time spent lying down on the shower floor, or freezing in the fetal position with a towel, the countless hours just wasting time until I would be able to achieve my next high, distracting my brain from its obsessive pursuit of opiates, only momentarily of course. The half sick blues, purgatory, knowing that you were indeed going to get sweet relief but no clue as to WHEN. So I would distract my brain, scroll social media incessantly, checking r/opiates non-stop and reading all the stories, the anticipation of opiate bliss laid in the background of not knowing if ‚Äú20 minutes‚Äù meant 20 minutes or 3 hours. Each relapse not knowing if it was gonna be 3 days or 20 years, or I suppose as so many have done before, pure darkness...\n\n\n\nThat time could have been spent doing so many better things, I admit I sometimes look at non-addicts like ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs your fuckin excuse!?‚Äù But that time spent was a part of my process, which fortunately eventually turned into my progress, and I have suffered and put myself through way too much fucking shit to give it all away, whether that be through relapse or just merely taking it all for granted. Because in relation to where I was, any beautiful spring day where I‚Äôm not laying in bed sick is a good one.",

    "selftext": "I‚Äôve posted this in a couple different replies where I felt the OP could use some encouragement, so I apologize if you‚Äôve already seen this, but I think I am brave enough now to make my own post.\n\nMy Oxy problem got bad quick, and continued getting worse for a couple years until I got on methadone. Originally , I planned to use methadone to get off of drugs altogether, but quickly started using it to just not get sick while I was between scores of dope.\n\nOf course, methadone blocks a lot of the dope, so I ended up having to do even MORE dope to come anywhere near how high I got before. And then when I tested positive for opiates at the clinic, they‚Äôd increase my methadone dose!\n\nSoon I was at 180+mg of methadone. I also picked up a bit of a benzo habit as on methadone, it fucked me up nicely.\n\nThat went on for a couple years.\n\nBefore I got on methadone, I had tried to go cold turkey a couple times and failed. Once, I even tried to go cold turkey off of methadone and HOLY SHIT, MISTAKE. It was WAY worse than getting off of regular opiates and would never try to do that again.... until I had to.\n\nI had been evicted and was staying basically in my car, until I got super fucked up on Oxy, Xanax, Valium and somas, and crashed my car, ending in a dui arrest. I was in jail for a week, going cold turkey from methadone and everything else.\n\nLongest. Week. EVER.\n\nWhen I got out I was finally able to convince my mom to let me stay with her. I stayed in bed for about 3 weeks, and counting the first week in jail and a few subsequent days at my moms, I stayed up for 11 days, shaking, shivering, jerking my legs, running to the bathroom every twenty seconds, worst headache imaginable... it was PURE HELL. \n\nBut it was also all the motivation I needed to never fuck up again. But even then I still had problems, I had been using since I was 15, and didn‚Äôt quit til I was 23. I had NOTHING, and was still essentially an emotional 15 year old. I stayed unemployed for a couple years at my moms. Eventually got a shitty job and started paying off my legal bills and fees to get my license back.\n\nWithin a few years I got my own car.... then my own house, then another car. Started a business. Met a great, great woman to share my life with, and I am happier than I have ever been. \n\nThe following image is of me on day 1 of sobriety, getting ready to start hell week in jail. The second image is of me on day 4,207, late in 2020.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/CN2XrAJ\n\nPeople say I don‚Äôt even look like the same person, and in a way, they‚Äôre not the same person. That first guy isn‚Äôt even really a person, just a dead husk of a person, with nothing in his eyes. But biologically, they‚Äôre both the exact same individual.\n\nIt‚Äôd be hard for anyone to be sicker than the person in that first photograph. So if you‚Äôre here because you‚Äôre despairing while helping a seemingly-hopelessly-addicted loved one, or are struggling with yourself.....if I can do it, anyone can. I am by no means a strong person at all. But even I found it within me to beat this thing. Not just beat it, but fucking killed it.\n\nEDIT: grateful for the kind words and even more grateful for those who said my post helps them, that really means a lot to me. Thank you!",

OD‚Äôs, losing jobs, many many many attempts at detox with and without subs, traumatic experiences, homelessness, fights with gf, fights with mom, lost relationships, and then finally the threat of jail.\n\nFast forward to the weekend before March 11th 2019, I was sitting in a motel room coming down from a 4 month binge. I had gotten kicked out of my moms a couple weeks before. I had a warrant to appear in court for multiple shoplifting charges. I had completely ran out of money. I was just so fucking exhausted of the life and knew something needed to change. Checked into rehab where I stayed for 65 days.\n\nNot gonna make this a super long post, but my life has completely changed from getting sober. I‚Äôve made so many friends in recovery, I went back to school, my relationship with my family has never been better. I‚Äôve been at the same job the whole time. I‚Äôve had many close connections and spiritual experiences. I‚Äôll admit, I‚Äôm not perfect. Life isn‚Äôt perfect, but damn I‚Äôve never had it this good.\n\nIf you‚Äôre struggling, reach out for help. It‚Äôs there if you want it. Come on over to the good life. I remember posting here before I got clean about how suicidal I was on like day 12 of trying to detox off heroin and about how pointless life was. If you‚Äôre feeling like this, just know you don‚Äôt ever have to again. It gets better, I promise.",

I got my hands on a finite amount and stupidly told myself I'd stop when I ran out but last night in an even bigger moment of weakness decided I wanted back in and texted my old dealer (not deleting his number immediately upon getting clean was probably mistake #1).  We talked a bit and then I asked him if he'd hook me back up.  \n\nHe said yeah he was still dealing and sure he'd sell to me if I really wanted but he'd always liked me and had been happy to see me get help and then asked if this was something I really, truly wanted.  We texted back and forth for several hours.  We'd been friends in high school but eventually he became nothing but my dealer so he's seen the absolute piece of shit addiction turned me into (lying, stealing, hurting everyone I ever loved) as well as what I was like before and he talked some sense into me.\n\nHe suggested I delete his number and then I dumped the last few of the pills down the toilet.  I'd thought four years was enough to get over this and I let my guard down and it snuck back up on me.  Really, really happy I didn't go through with it.

    "selftext": "Hello all,\n\nIt's been a while since I've posted here, although I still lurk regularly. Six years ago, I finally succeeded in kicking my eight-year heroin addiction and decided to focus on my novel. Today that novel is complete and fully published!\n\n\nI'll post the synopsis below along with a link to my amazon page but knowing that our type isn't usually flush with money, I also come to you today for your perspective. If anyone here has the time and an active amazon account, I'd be happy to send you a digital copy of my book for free in exchange for a well thought out review of the book on my amazon page.\n\n**Private Destiny**\n\nA degenerate anti-hero for this post-post-modern age of cynicism, Rick Thompson feels like he has missed the train, that America's best days are behind him. In this novel that spans the dark side of modern Americana, Rick struggles to stay clean on the streets of a New York City ravaged by The Sickness, a drug epidemic out of control and of conspiratorial proportions. His investigative journalism career seems to have hit a dry spell until Rick stumbles onto a case that he believes ties the biggest corporation in the state to the epidemic, which could lead not only to the greatest story of his career but might also be the answer to curing all those afflicted around him. That is until his ex shows up to his apartment with something that will bring them deeper into this conspiracy than he could have ever wanted.\n\nPrivate Destiny highlights just how easily the American mind seems to fall prey to the delusion and convenience of conspiracy and tells a story that shows how, in a world without meaning, most people are left to make up their own. It's crime, conspiracy, sex, drugs, societal critique, and psychological reflection bundled in the dark humor of a pulp shell.\n\nIf this sounds like a book that intrigues you and you have the time, send me a DM and i'd be happy to get you an electronic ARC (Advance review copy) in exchange for a review.\n\nIf you don't feel like reviewing the book but would still love to read it, please grab a paperback copy at the link below! Thank you guys so much, I'm happy to be a part of this community and I hope that you all get a fraction out of this book what I put into it. I also hope this can inspire others who went through the same hell to reach for there dreams. Cheers!\n\n[Private Destiny Paperback Link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C1JK85GD)",

Your brain has done some *mighty* strange repairs on the u-opioid receptors you damaged after 8 years of being an addict. You'll likely puke, you'll definitely feel like shit. Might take 2-3 days of using to actually acclimate and get that good feeling you *think* you miss/want/deserve or whatever. And by then, you'll not want to stop and take more. Time will fucking FLY man. And then it'll be a week and you'll think, OK I better stop before I have to go through actual withdrawls... \"just one more time\". But oh shit, wait, I have a responsibility tomorrow or maybe something shitty happened at work/home... Well, ok I'll just get through this and quit after that. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGreat, now you're at a month and, well, now you're really screwed. You've probably started picking up packs of cigarettes again. You'll definitely raise red flags with the wife - she ~~probably~~  definitely noticed from day 1 something was up. You'll be obsessing over picking up, and acting like a bonafide addict trying to get more. Hopefully others won't notice, but they might. You'll definitely be depressed and sluggish and hating yourself. It'll probably take several attempts at actually stopping. Two weeks if you're really lucky. Thrashing around in your sleep, constant stomach issues and liquid shits, yawning, wondering why you didn't just go back to being happy in the first place. You'll think about why you're here... again. And how happy you were and how you regret not listening to these four words: Don't fucking do it. Tell the devil to fuck right off with that shit. You got way too many goals to put that fake-ass unhealthy-shit into your body. And in case I wasn't clear, remember, if you do use today, you're gunna feel like shit mentally and physically... \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou had your fun, it's time to grow the fuck up and reach your goals - Saving up enough money to go exploring the world. Laughing with your wife over a fancy dinner. Being a complete doofus with your kids.

I NEED to tell this story for anyone living the nightmare....there is NOTHING like Ibogaine in the world and it deeply saddens me not every addict suffering will have the opportunity to do this.\n\nI won't source, but just did 10 days in a Mexico location.  It was expensive ($14,000), it was uncomfortable...I tripped for 38 hours and didn't sleep for 4 days....but when it was over....I felt a sickness in my stomach at the thought of using drugs...and I cried like a baby because I couldn't believe this was real.\n\nFor the past 3 years my life has revolved around snorting fentanyl...and the slow progression of addiction created a self hatred in myself I thought nothing would ever be able to heal.  But when tripping on the Ibogaine, I had these voices inside me..just telling me to \"let go\".  And after not being able to access my emotions for almost 14 years since the death of my girlfriend to an eating disorder....I fucking balled my eyes out like a child.  And when I woke, there was a sense of complete separation from the emotions not allowing me to love again.  I felt love for myself, I felt acceptance from my past, and it was without a doubt the most profound spiritual experience of my life.\n\nI am now home and have NO DESIRE to use.  I know I am not cured....work needs to be done...but I have cried every morning waking up since Ibogaine at how my nightmare is over.  This is the best I have felt spiritually and physically in my life.\n\nIf you are struggling with addiction like I was, and see no end in sight....I urge you to do some research and consider for yourself.  I researched this for 2 years before deciding to do this.\n\nI am truly blessed to have done this, and just wanted to share...without Ibogaine...I truly believe I would be dead within the next year...and now, I feel a renewed sense of life I've never had.

Then down the line someone offers us a little bump of coke, or maybe a little molly or shrooms or acid. We say sure, then when we wake up fine the next day we think. Wtf they where definitely lying! Drugs are awesome!! \n\nWhat they need to do is be completely honest with kids about drugs. Tell them, yes at first drugs are going to feel amazing, but the thing about drugs is that they seduce you and trick you and rewire your brain without even realizing it! One day you‚Äôll be recreationally using, the next you will need it just to not feel like shit the next day. What really helped me to start getting clean was learning about the way it rewires the reward center of my brain.

I got an opportunity, that I turned into another one. I kept my head down, and did what I was told. And now my life is beautiful. Through the 12 steps, and with the help of others, I didn‚Äôt get my life back; I got a better one. My girlfriend and I are going to get engaged this month.

I knew full well what would happen to me if I picked up again. I would lose everything at a breathtaking pace, guaranteed to be homeless and jobless with a habit on top.

After the heroin was gone, I erased the plugs number and realized that I could still save everything and be okay if I just stopped. And I did. I feel immense guilt and sadness from this experience, and I need to understand what it was that grabbed hold of me so suddenly, allowing me to justify using. But I think I made it.

Also my profession is at stake if I get recognized at the meetings -  would never take that risk! Life is simply too good at this point! It took me 6 years to come this far and I will spend the rest of my days by enjoying how life has become instead of regretting how my life have been.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA huge thanks to this community! I dunno how I would have made it this far without you guys! When I was struggling there was always help to find in this subreddit! I wish the best for all of you and here's to the best community on reddit!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf this can inspire anyone: I struggled with a 150-200 mg oxy / 300 - 400 mg morphine addiction over the last half year of my addiction. I was 1 semester from gratuating. I quitted cold turkey and got a hold on my self after 10-12 days withdrawal, took my final exams and gratuated with good grades :)",

If you are suicidal, or even *entertaining* the thought of suicide you **need to get help. NOW.**\n\nI'll paraphrase a response I gave in another thread: opiate addiction already has a ridiculously high mortality rate, when you add in depression and suicidal ideation you would have a better chance of survival getting ebola while cave diving. I don't want to diminish the value of this message board, and I don't want to discourage people from posting here if they are struggling with this stuff, but I can't stress enough that considering suicide goes FAR beyond the purview of this forum. \n\nSo, if you are considering suicide PLEASE get help. Tell a loved one. Tell a doctor. Call a hotline. Go to an Urgent Care or ER. Call 911. Ask someone to hold onto any firearms for you. Whatever it takes. I tried to kill myself in 2008 and have lost too many friends since then. I fucking hate cliches, but it really is a permanent solution to temporary problems.\n\n----------------------\n\nYou CAN do this. Please, if you are considering suicide you should know that you can walk into any medical clinic anywhere in the United States and tell them you think you might hurt yourself and you **will** get treatment. You could walk into a fucking plastic surgery clinic and if you said you were concerned you might hurt yourself they would either render care (unlikely) or get you to someone who would ASAP. \n\nYou can't beat an addiction if you're dead. There is a whole lot of life out there, go get it.\n",

    "selftext": "So, my son (21) is currently in rehab. Again. We fought for him to get out of prison bc of this whole virus. He had been awaiting in patient rehab, but no one was accepting new patients at that time due to the same. So, we brought him home. Gave him naltrexone every day, and crossed our fingers he would stay well. \n\nTwo weeks later, he overdosed. I had to hit him with three doses of narcan to bring him back. This isn't the first time. I don't even want to reflect on how many, it'll make me cry. He's been in the hospital in the ICU before with Rhabdomyolysis. So bad, at 20 years old he was on dialysis, and they were discussing kidney transplants. Miraculously he bounced back. And entered his first, of many, in patient, rehabs. \n\nSo many of his friends who are/were also lost in addiction praise us for always being there for him. Bc most of their parents aren't great. And don't care. So, I try and do what I can to help them as well. My mom was, and is an addict. I've been totally estranged from her for years. I know what kind of awful pain that is to not have the support of a parent.  I'm so lost as to what to do for him. My brain is probably broken from all the stress of seeing him almost die so many times. The way someone looks when they overdose...it's awful. And for that someone to be your baby boy? It's beyond description. I'm only 40 and I feel like I'm 100. That said, I keep just compartmentalizing. I keep moving. I have another son (14) who needs taking care of, and is I'm sure, emotionally damaged from this as well. \n\nSo, I come on here. It gives me hope to see so many success stories. But also, I can try to give you guys an ear, or encouraging words. I can't help my son right now, but if I can be some sort of support for someone else, I would be grateful for it.

I immediately start shoveling Xanax in my mouth and spiral into a 2 week blackout, resulting in the loss of my job, being kicked out of my parents (I went there to go through withdrawl I have my own place) and being taken to the hospital by my sister because I was incoherently rambling one day and smashing my bathroom sink. All these events and more are mere snapshots in my memory. \n\nAnd then, as quickly as that spiral began, the drugs ran out and the withdrawl was here and I was alone in my apartment to fight through it. \n\nSo I went through it. 3 nights of impulsive body twitching and rocking back and forth followed by 5 more sleepless nights and countless symptoms I never want to put my bathroom through again. Need I say more?\n\nI share this story because I never thought that I could feel like me again without using. I'm right at 3 weeks clean and for fucks sake I'm coming around.

I had recently managed to stay clean for about 6 months and I've been doing pretty well in my second year of university.\n\nNear the end of my first semester, my back started to really bother me again. I'm a pretty tall guy and I have dealt with back pain for many years now but it seemed to just be getting worse. Of course I booked an appointment with my campus physio, but my addict brain needed that instant relief so I went ahead and ordered some kratom online. It did help with my back, but more importantly, it felt *really great*. I spent the next month chugging green sludge multiple times per day, consuming an ungodly amount of grapefruit juice in the process. I had convinced myself that this was an excellent long-term solution.\n\nOf course the euphoria left me wanting more. By the Christmas break, I couldn't help but think about heroin. I had nearly a month to myself, which I figured was plenty of time for me to binge and recover before my second semester began. Once I flew home, I chucked my bag of kratom and did exactly that. I've experienced the anguish of withdrawal many times, but at this point my fiend mindset had no consideration for what I would be putting my future self through.\n\nI ran out of heroin five days ago and have been suffering cold turkey since. I may not have used for as long as some other people on this sub but a couple weeks for me is enough to put me through hell afterwards. I'm angry at myself for allowing this to happen again.\n\nI understand kratom is helpful for withdrawls but if you don't need it for that then please don't buy it. As in my case it could trigger a full relapse.",

    "selftext": "So as the title mentions, I was stuck in a shitty habit, throw in some fentanyl every now and then because half the times the oxy80‚Äôs I was getting were Canadian ‚ÄúGreen Goblins‚Äù that are really fentanyl. \nI lost everything in the span of a few months. I lost my apartment, I lost my girlfriend, I lost my life savings spending around 40K on this shit since the past year and now down to zero dollars. I‚Äôm VERY lucky my parents allowed me to move back with them, not everyone has that privilege. In doing so I reached out for help from them and from the local hospital. Went cold turkey with only clonodine and melatonin, not even any weed was used and I plan on staying away from that as well now. \nI figured I couldn‚Äôt do this alone so as a result of asking my parents for help they would go on to take all electronics from me so as to cutoff contact with the outside world while I spent 14days in detox at home. That way I‚Äôm definitely unable to relapse. \nWithin those 14 days I went through hell, but I decided to take the advice of Reddit and really work those endorphins through 1H long cardio sessions. The exercise bike at my parents house has broken electronics so the resistance is stuck on its highest setting which made these 1H workouts very intense. You think you sweat during withdrawal? Wait until you add that onto this routine you‚Äôll be raining from your armpits! \nOf course day 1 I had no energy and skipped out, but day 2 I took a fuckton of vitamins and omega3 pills, then drank a protein shake and worked out until I couldn‚Äôt any longer. Each day after I did the same thing. Living without my phone for this period sucked but I used the time to create a poem (lol), a song on guitar, got a 92% in a midterm exam, and dropped from 230lbs to 198lbs. \nToday I got my phone and laptop back so I charged it up and took advantage of my newfound cardio abilities and biked up the tallest mountain in my city which took 2.5hours to complete but the feeling of making it to the top outweighs any feeling opiates ever gave me. Weird, I‚Äôm down to zero dollars and lost opportunities but I‚Äôve never been more genuinely happy in my life. \nFor those of you still using, ask for help where you can and don‚Äôt do it alone :)",

    "selftext": "Yesterday was 2 years since my brother died at the end of his 10 year opiate addiction. He was only 26.\n\nHe didn't OD. Found him dead in my living room at 5 am. We found out after he died he had been going hard on imodium. Idk if it was to stave off withdrawal and cravings or if he was trying to get a buzz. But in his autopsy report the cause of death is loperamide and secondary cardiomegaly. \n\nHe died on a Saturday and the following Wednesday I was going to be tagging and insuring his truck so he could get to a methadone clinic consistently. He was so optimistic. He had a boyfriend he loved and lived with. They had plans together and he had plans to go back to school. He had just started learning to cook and was super excited to cook his new recipes for me. But he died trying to manage it alone. \n\nSo, I'm glad you're here. I'm glad you've found a community for inspiration and motivation and to not feel alone.\n\nI'm glad you're taking the steps into recovery. Maybe you're reading this because you're still in active addiction and considering taking the first steps into recovery- please do it. Here's your sign!\n\nMy brother was my first friend. Im only 2 years older than him. I miss him terribly. Everytime he saw me, he'd walk up and put his right hand on my right shoulder blade, lean in slightly and quietly say *\"[name], why are you such a goddamn bitch?\"* I really miss that snarky shit only a little brother can get away with. He talked to me a lot about addiction and what got him to that point.\n\nAnd I've known so many addicts in my life. I've loved most of them. The father of my kids just hit 1 year clean from meth and let me tell you two things\n\n\n1. I know people do awful things in active addiction. My kid's dad still deals with a lot of guilt. He did do some awful, horrible things. But like I tell him, I'm still glad he's here. Every awful thing he did combined is not a fraction as painful as losing my brother. So again, I'm glad you're here and reading this. I dont know any of you personally, but I know many of you are just exactly the same as my brother, my husband, my uncle, my best friend, my coworkers.\n\n\n2. All the addicts I've known, their stories are all different but also the same, too. Every addict I've known is struggling with something, hurting in some non-physical way. They need something fun. Something to feel better. An escape. Next thing they know, they're an addict. But you deserve to be happy, not just high.\n\n\n\nAnyway. I hope I am not coming off preachy or any way negative at all. I just really miss my brother and wish I could say these things to him.\n\nSo instead I will say it to you. All strangers, but I do sincerely care. You can fucking do this. You're doing GREAT. Keep going. I am proud of you. You should be proud of yourself, too.\n\nBe safe.",

A couple years ago, a guy in long-time recovery gave him some suboxone & apparently the experiment succeeded. My son started using it, but without a prescription it was costing him as much as the opiates had. Finally in September 2020 he went, saw a doctor, got a prescription. That is also when he started being more open with me. He said that when he left the office with that prescription for suboxone in his hand, it was the first time in years that he thought maybe he had a future he could look forward to. After three years of my anxiety & his prevarication, you can imagine how happy that made me. It wasn‚Äôt easy though. A co-worker tested positive for Covid-19 and so my son, who had been seen talking to him for about one minute, got sent home for a 14-day quarantine. You know where this is going, right? Relapse, then massive fentanyl overdose. You can read about him in [this article](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2021/05/fentanyl-opioid-crisis-overdoses-covid-pandemic).\n\nI can‚Äôt change what‚Äôs happened, but I come to this subreddit to better understand what my son went through, and to learn the best way that I might help people in his situation.

I had gone to detox twice before, but only stayed the 6 or 7 days to get through w/d. This time i went to \"residential\" after detox. I planned on staying for the month long program, but I ended up staying for 98 days or something crazy.               \n             \nI transitioned from rehab to a sober house, and I'm still here. I love it here. My sober house is very laid back. It's not staffed. It's basically an apartment with extra rules. I get urine screened at random, there is a zero tolerance policy here. Curfew is at 11 during the week, midnite on weekends. Unless I'm at work, I can come home whenever. I can \"sleep out\" if I want, just give prior notice. I have my own room. My PS4 and guitar is here. My truck's parked outside. And I go work when it's available. They used to require 4 meetings a week, but now, with COVID putting the kibosh on a lot of meetings, we host our own, mon/wed/fri.             \n            \nChurches are starting to open up, so they're talking about going back to outside meetings again. At first, I didnt mind. I was actually kind of relieved. But now that it's been a while, i kind of miss going to meetings. I know they're not for everybody, and I still cannot do the \"god,\" part. But NA is much less saturated with it. And for me, it's not about the literature. It's more about connecting with people, having some accountability, and hearing a message of hope. And who knows, maybe I can help a newcomer. Even if i just give them a ride home.            \n             \nI really love it here. The rent is cheap.

Grateful for the people I live with and my mending relationships with family.               \n            \nI don't take any of it for granted. Because I'm not special. I know I'm one bad decision away from being back in detox, or prison, or homeless again. I don't miss any of it.             \n           \nFor those of you that this matters to, no I'm not on MATs. No methadone or suboxone or anything. I have nothing against MATs. If it keeps you off the streets and away from hard use, then please, just dont abuse it. I've tried suboxone maintenance in the past, and it wasn't for me. I still drank like a fish, and ended up using in between doctor visits.

Luckily in the back of my mind I had a glimmer of hope that things could get better.\n\nI‚Äôve heard it said that as long as an addict is still breathing there is hope for recovery. I am a big believer in this. I am 27 years old and have tried in one form or another for the past ten years to get clean. After 4 major overdoses, a dozen rehab stints, and countless stories of pain and heartache I decided that I deserve happiness and a life free from active addiction.\n\nWhat worked for me was inpatient rehab/detox for 30 days, 90 NA/AA meetings the first 90 days, working the twelve steps with a sponsor and calling him daily, weekly group counseling in an early recovery group, one year in a sober living home, and welbutrin/Zoloft/Vivitrol shot for PAWS depression and opiate cravings. If you can get it I would highly recommend giving vivitrol a chance. Once again this is just what has worked for me and I understand everybody is different.\n\nThank you for letting me share my story. My wish is that someone out there who is struggling may read this and find some hope. That we do recover and you do deserve happiness.\n\nPeace and love,\nMatt",

    "selftext": "\n\nHey guys, I like to try and post this every once in a while. And this question is obviously not for those who do not have the resources. We all need some tough love sometimes, so what a better time than the holiday season to give some of you lovely people who are still struggling something to think about. And this, inherently, is going to fill some of you with rage because looking in the mirror can sometimes be painful. So I‚Äôll just say it. \n\n‚Äú$100k for the cars, half a mill for the addiction. They shipped me off to rehab because I started questioning my existence. Give me the prescriptions and I‚Äôll show you repetition, stubborn motherfucker you know Ruby never listens‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nWhy are you still refusing to go to rehab? What lie did you tell yourself today? \n\nOh, you‚Äôre gonna do it on your own? How has that worked out for you so far? Oh, but a guy on reddit told you you won‚Äôt be dopesick if you just drink 5000 milligram of vitamin C six times a day? Ah, foolproof. You‚Äôve sure outsmarted addiction this time. Just be sure to eat a whole pack of Immodium with it too, just like that one guy told you before.\n\nYour parents/friends/coworkers/peers will judge you? I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre saving their judgements for now. They weren‚Äôt judging you when you nodded off at the dinner table, nor were they judging when you when they heard you sniffling coming out of the office bathroom for the 9th time before 10am. They‚Äôre gonna think you‚Äôre a no good fucking junkie now that you‚Äôre finally giving sobriety an honest shot. (The sarcasm is strong with this one.) \n\nIt doesn‚Äôt work? It sure doesn‚Äôt, until you talk to someone it did for. But even then, it wasn‚Äôt the rehab that did it was it? You didn‚Äôt really buy into that culty shit did you? Heard the food sucks. Oh well it only works for like, 1% of people anyway. They must have got real lucky. Good for them though.\n\nI could keep going on and on about all these super legit and valid excuses to not give treatment a shot, but I digress. Fortunately none of you knew me during active addiction. You would have seen me screaming in my mothers face about how rehab doesn‚Äôt work; at my mothers celebration of four years sober after she went to rehab. Truly a sight to behold.\n\nHappy Holidays folks. I truly wish all of you the best this new year. And I‚Äôll part with a useful piece of information. At the treatment facility I went to, if you could simply pay the deductible and get in, the facility would NEVER send your remaining bill to collections. Do what you will with that information. And go to fucking rehab.",

I did compressions until paramedics arrived and I brought her pulse back but it was too late for her brain.\n\nAs her next of kin I had to make some of the toughest decisions of my life but because of that she saved 3 peoples lives with organ donations which is very meaningful because she was a giver in life and wanted nothing more than to help others in need. \n\nI am now a widowed father and I am struggling so hard not to use and I have a few times but I literally can‚Äôt continue for the sake of my son. He cannot be left orphaned and I need to live so her memory stays alive. \n\nI loved her with everything I had and I feel like my soul has been sundered. I know I will see her again one day but it‚Äôs taking so much for me to not make that day happen sooner but I also know she would find a way to double kill me if I left our son parentless.\n\n\nAnyways, just really struggling and sorry for going on so much.

One year with my pain controlled, my life stable, and my world  not upside down \n\n\nSince I dont read this q lot here lemme.just say... RECOVERY IS POSSIBLE FOR PAIN PATIENTS!!! You do not have to ditch your bupe or your done just to make a sobriety statement. You can recover using your  medication as needed.  Bupe is enough to manage my pain with my gaba  qne keep me sane. Some people on here (aka assoles) try to say that I should be able to make due without it. But honestly my.recovery is about me - not whatever fool tries to decide pain relief =/= recovery. \n\nThanks for letting me ramble y'all. So proud",

    "selftext": "I was given my first pain pill when I was 14 after blowing out my knee playing football.  Wow. What a feeling. Who knew the world could feel this way! It was the single greatest feeling of my life, unfortunately. I am now almost 34 and I can say there hasn‚Äôt been a single 24 hours that I have gone without at least some pain pill in almost 20 years. You see I was a ‚Äúlucky‚Äù addict. I got a legal constant supply. I kept playing football, kept getting injured, more pain meds, and more pain meds. Then they discovered a heart condition I‚Äôve had since birth. More surgeries and more pain meds. Those heart surgery‚Äôs go wrong, they lead to even more, which leads to a pacemaker, and so many complications that it‚Äôs just easier to throw high dose morphine at it and call it a day. 2 years ago I hit bottom. My wife and son almost left me. Rightfully so. They should have. They didn‚Äôt. I looked in the mirror and told myself ‚Äúno more, today we start taking out life back‚Äù within a month I called an old employer. Got a job I didn‚Äôt deserve, that I wasn‚Äôt qualified for, but was trained in anyway. A year ago I started a taper program on my own. I knew if I was going to do this, then it had to be my choice and no one else‚Äôs. I didn‚Äôt talk to my doctors. No one but my wife knew, to keep me honest with myself. Today, after the single hardest night of my life I can finally say ‚ÄúI am free!‚Äù. I no longer will be a slave to my next dose. I will no longer say no to activities, get together, and trips because I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll have enough pills. I will no longer be a slave to a substance that did nothing but cause more pain. Today I finally have my hands back on the wheel. Today I can finally be the captain of my own ship! Damn it feels fucking good!\n\nEdit: Thank you so much for all the support and awesome comments. I want to address something, I think in my happiness I have come off as ‚Äúmaking it look easy‚Äù. It‚Äôs not. I know that. We are all different and we have all turned away from our lives and into pills for our own reasons and traumas. I don‚Äôt mean to diminish the immense struggle that addiction is. Some one commented that I should check myself, not celebrate to early, because it‚Äôs only the first couple days. They were very right and a little wrong. They were right that I am at the starting line of a life long race, the pills and the craving will always be trying to beat me. I know I have many hurdles and struggles ahead. But I‚Äôm also proud of myself because of how far I have come. I could fill a book with the horrible things I‚Äôve done for pills. I‚Äôve never bought pills, that was true. But I‚Äôve done a lot worse than pay for them. Things I‚Äôll never truly forgive myself for. The most important thing I‚Äôve learned in my journey is that withdrawal won‚Äôt kill you. It will suck. You even may want to die but the you that comes out the other side is worth it. I couldn‚Äôt write everything in one post, in 34 years I‚Äôve had almost as many surgeries. I have been so close to death countless times. I‚Äôve had family say goodbye to me. I‚Äôve lost friends, family, and I almost lost the two ppl most important to me but I haven‚Äôt given up yet. I know that every person struggling with addiction has gone through some horrible and unspeakable things. It‚Äôs easier to just numb the pain away. What‚Äôs easier isn‚Äôt always what‚Äôs best though, I hope that maybe my, ultimately probably useless yell into the void, may help 1 person. Because if 1 more person gets sober, than everything is worth it. Don‚Äôt give up. You are worth it!",

I'm planning on using vivitrol for a year, maybe two, because honestly, as long as heroin exists on this planet I really can't place any confidence in my ability to abstain on my own, and I've learned that it's going to find you one way or another, some day, every. fucking. time. I've been stringing together days all year just to fall off before I'm halfway done detoxing, I think I made it through being dopesick twice but relapsed on day 2 or 3 of feeling somewhat normal. I never felt so powerless before. I've been addicted to hard drugs with varying degrees of severity/dependence since 17, but heroin really became the ONE about three years ago. This year shit got extremely real. I legitimately could not function without it. I almost lost my job, which has never even come close to happening before. So these last 30 days are extremely special to me. I wasn't sure I'd live through some days and I was genuinely okay with that as long as I was high as fuck. Does getting high sound good? At first. Then I play the tape through, fast forward in my mind to the empty bag, and then it's really not all that appealing anymore. I deserve better. I am finally realizing that, not just in my mind but in my body, the idea that I'm worth fighting for is not just a concept anymore but something I am genuinely coming to believe to be true and aligning my behaviors and actions with this principle is still something I actively have to manage with myself day to day, but it's getting easier and I know if I can keep it up then it wont be long before self-respect and care are my new normal. \n\nIf you read this, thank you for hearing me. I appreciate you.\n\n I just needed to say something to people who get what this is like. I'm on the west coast and outdoors in general is not where you want to be right now so a meeting is out of the question. Right now though, for today, I'm not worried about anything but getting through the next 24 hours. One minute at a time if necessary.\n\nHere's hoping this time it sticks and stays stuck. If you're struggling right now, if you're dopesick right now, my heart goes out to you, and I know you can do this. If I can, you can. We are all worthy of happiness and inner peace.",

This is a whole other universe for me. I've read so much about it, I know this is just the beginning and I can't \"cure\"\nI am the only person she knows in this Washington, she is from Michigan.

Being brought to the hospital against your will and tied down to the bed. Your mom looking at the doctor and saying this is not my son. You think that would be enough to make a person stop. Nope, not me. \n\nThat would make a rational person stop. But addiction is irrationality,impulsivity and insanity all rolled into one. That‚Äôs just the nature of this disease. My thinking was so warped that I could not grasp what was going on with me. I had completely lost control. I HAD to use. There was no choice. I am sure some of you can relate to this feeling of ultimate hopelessness and despair. I never want to feel that way again. \n\nI recently relapsed after almost two and a half years clean. It was short and there were not many serious consequences, but it was definitely headed that way. I forgot all about shitting my pants while laying in bed at a rehab facility. Stealing from my family and getting arrested. All I could think about was ‚Äòhmm getting high would feel great right now‚Äô. \n\nBut it just wasn‚Äôt the same.

They promised it all and gave me bullshit in return. \n\nAnyways, just felt the need to get this off my chest. If your struggling, just remember you are not in this battle alone. Thanks for letting me rant. I love each and every one of you. Take care",

I never thought I would be able to get off the shit.  Well 32 days ago I said fuck this and decided it's time for me to try and live my life without this crap in it.  The first week was hard as hell. I quit cold turkey. I tried Kratom for the first 2 days and it made my anxiety worse not to mention I truly wanted off everything this time so I threw that shit away to.

    "selftext": "  \n\nI did my first opiate painkiller when I was 17. Was buying OxyContins 80MG pills by age 19. Could do 5 a day if I really wanted to. And then I moved to a different state for an unrelated reason and just sort of stopped. I tried finding opiates but couldn't hook it up. Eventually I just gave up on it and lived life. I suffer from colitis though and every now and then would get a script of painkillers or IV morphine at the hospital. I never went so far as to try and buy more outside of a doctor though. So from age 20-24, I didn't really do opiates so much.\n\nThen at age 24 everything changed. I eventually stumbled my way onto people who used opiates. What I didn't know was that times changed from 2010 to 2017. Now, you couldn't get Oxys on the streets willy nilly. Now, everyone was doing the hard shit. They were doing heroin. And that just sounded too scary to me. So instead, I'd buy Opanas. It made me feel better and like it wasn't as bad since it wasn't heroin. Little did I know, they're very similar and in a lot of cases, opanas are stronger and higher quality which is why they're so expensive. One night, I was in the process of getting an Opana and the guy with them wasn't home. The middleman who was helping me get it had heroin on him. He let me try it. He also said \"If you want, we can get some of this right now\"   \n\n\nSo that's what we did.\n\nI quickly became addicted. But being the logical person I am, I knew it was an issue QUICK. Within a month, I got on Suboxone. And for the next few months, I was good. I was good until one day I was offered some heroin, and did it regardless of the suboxone blocker. Surprisingly, despite it not being that much heroin, I got high despite having taken suboxone that morning. Before I knew it, I was doing it everyday and this time, there was no middlemen. I had a plug this time. That meant I could get big quantities for under the market value. That meant I could use way more than the other addicts around me. I quickly started flaunting the fact that I had large amounts. I become somewhat popular and well known in my town among addicts. I proceeded to make a lot of Fairweather friends. I was so lonely though and in so much pain, that I found comfort in the friends, even though I knew they were only there for my material possessions and resourceful nature.\n\nMy family knew that I was spiraling out of control. Within a 30 day period, I was charged with a felony and with possession. I was looking at a few years in prison if I didn't preform a miracle. My family sent me to a rehab in Florida. I wish this was the end of the story but it wasn't.\n\nAfter I got out of the rehab in Florida, my family set me up with a nice place complete with furniture, and everything I needed for success. \n\nBut I missed the drugs. I missed feeling \"on top of the world\" I missed the Fairweather friends that gave me a sense of importance. So I left the place behind to go back to where I was. Horrible decision. It didn't take long for me to relapse. This time I spent six months using. I ended up in the hospital with an abscess. I wasn't far from death.\n\nSoon after the hospital, I found myself in rehab again. I was determined to be clean. I never wanted to use again. I lost too much. I sincerely meant it too. I had every intention in the world to remain sober. And I would have too, if I didn't run into some of the biggest life stressors a human could go through.\n\nAfter checking out of rehab, I checked right into a sober living. I wanted to do everything right, with no stone unturned. I NEEDED sobriety. Well, unbeknownst to me, sober living homes are not good places. Oftentimes, the people who run the sober homes are bitterly sober individuals who are miserable. These miserable people have ultimate control over everyone in the house. I was ultimately kicked out of the halfway house for no reason at all other than \"not being a good fit\"\n\nIf someone who wants sobriety more than anything and will do anything to get there isn't a \"good fit\" then I don't know who is. It became apparent to me that sober living homes are popularity contests. After being kicked out of the halfway house, I suffered a lot. I lived in my car. I worked at a McDonalds and made $200 per week. I made it as long as a month in that misery without using. But after a certain amount of time passed with no progress, I lost hope. I used as soon as I was able to.\n\nThat situation showed me that things like homelessness and financial stress are absolutely sobriety threatening issues. No one would help me. I was all on my own. If I was able to access a small amount of capital to help me jumpstart my life, I would have stayed sober. I just needed a place to live, shower, cook, and sleep, and I would have been equipped to build from that.\n\nFinally I got into another halfway house. This time, I did everything I could to not be kicked out. With a little bit of luck, I didn't get kicked out of the next one. That's where I stayed for four months. Eventually, I got my own apartment, where I live now.\n\nI don't like to recognize \"sobriety dates\" or anything like that, but here's how I look at it: As soon as I had my second stay at rehab, that's when my life changed. I've been a different person since then. As far as using, I used when I was homeless and I had four isolated relapses since. At this present time, I'm doing amazing. I love my apartment. I love my two dogs. I'm getting married in September. I take methadone to help me with cravings, and I'm happy. I think it's inevitable that I will use heroin or some kind of opiates again, but it's my hope that I will never ever go back to rock bottom. I'm going to approach every day with the goal to not get high on some dope but I know that's not realistic. I know that if I live to be 80, I have 52 more years on earth, and from now and then, I might get high on some opiates at some point. But I'm confident that I'll have the strength to bounce back quickly if that ever does happen.\n\nThat's my story.",

Once a weekend turns to using for a whole weekend, turns to add a day during the week, before you know it it‚Äôs every day. \n\nLet‚Äôs be real, real 30s cost twice what the pressies do and once you take a pressie you ain‚Äôt even trying to talk about anything you gone get from a pharmacy. Anyway, that once a weekend habit turned into 10 pressies a day. Granted I worked my way up there with time, but I was at that high of a dose for a couple months before jumping. \n\nYou guys know how much that shit costs, do the math on that shit. I‚Äôm fortunate enough that in this process I didn‚Äôt lose everything (it got close), my house, my car, my wife/5 year old son, etc. How may you ask??? Well fortunately I have a good job, but also because I didn‚Äôt keep my problems to myself. I recognized there was an issue and told my wife, and my parents to get some help. PLEASE DO NOT BE AFRAID TO TALK ABOUT THIS, we‚Äôre in an opioid epidemic right now. You will be shocked to learn how many others may have been in your shoes and you never knew. Anyway....\n\nSo it was what it was, I just quit. Cold turkey. Ain‚Äôt have no gaba, xans, kratom, weed, none of that shit. JUST STRAIGHT OFF THE MUSCLE! Day 6 I went ahead and bought 3 xan bars from a friend (who has a script, because in the streets those have fetty too now), just for the sleep. Got my sleep back and that‚Äôs all she wrote. Won‚Äôt take any more xans now, but I do now smoke weed everyday. I‚Äôve smoked weed since I was like 13, I just didn‚Äôt want any crutch during those first grueling 1-5 days. I wanted to feel all that pain and remember how fucking dumb I was for putting myself in that position. This withdrawal shit has so much to do with your mental approach to it. It sucks for sure. But you cannot allow yourself to be scared of it, that will only push you further away from actually making the jump. For any of you wanting to quit, do it TODAY! Not tomorrow, not next week, TODAY! \n\nI share this to tell you that it is possible. Fuck that fetty and fuck the people around you that think that using that shit is normal. It‚Äôs not. None of us as kids grew up and said hey I want to be a fucking junky when I grow up, so just check yourself. Mind over matter, man the fuck up and I PROMISE YOU you will get through this. Just straight off the muscle, you gotta tell yourself you‚Äôre built different, and you will not allow yourself to be a statistic. \n\nTrust me I get it, I know the battle isn‚Äôt over. There‚Äôs PAWS and all that other shit you guys worry about and get your brains wrapped around. But for me, it‚Äôs over at 10 days. I ain‚Äôt thinking about no PAWS. I‚Äôm just not OVERTHINKING the situation. Literally cut off anyone who had to do with that shit. I‚Äôm now spending time with my family, playing with my son, working harder and becoming better EVERY. SINGLE. DAY.\n\nI pray for y‚Äôall on here seriously. I know the shit is scary when you think of quitting, but I promise you you‚Äôll get through the shit. Come day 6, it feels like you‚Äôre reborn. Music helps too! Literally just 5-6 days of feeling like shit to get your life back!!\n\nTAKE YOUR LIFE BACK TODAY!! \n\nLove you guys and if any of you need someone to talk to just hit me up.",

The addict said thanks yet when the pills were gone, he was still in the hole. \n\nThe addicts cries were next heard by a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist asked, \"How did you get in there?Were you born in there? Did your parents put you in there? Tell me about yourself, it will alleviate your sense of loneliness.\" The addict talked to him for an hour then the psychiatrist had to leave but said he would be back in a week. The addict thanked him but was still in the hole. \n\nNext a priest heard the addict's cries and he threw him a Bible and said he would pray for him. The priest then got down on his knees and prayed over the addict and then left. The addict was very grateful and read the entire Bible yet he was still in that hole.  \n\nA recovering addict happened to walk by as the addict said, \"Hey help me, I'm stuck in this hole.\" The recovering addict immediately jumped in the hole with him. The addict said, \"What are you doing? Now we are both stuck in here!\" But the recovering addict said, \"It's OKAY, I've been here before, I KNOW THE WAY OUT!\" \n\n",

Just for the record I was at one point on subs for 6 years from 2009 to 2015 so I‚Äôm pretty well versed in how this works and still just reading this stuff (a lot of which is absolute bullshit) really gets in my head. I suppose I should have taken that advice, but since I didn‚Äôt it‚Äôs important to remember how powerfully the mind lies to us especially when it comes to getting clean and our expectations of how it‚Äôs gonna go, I mean how many times have we been dope sick as fuck but the second the plug says he‚Äôs pulling up we miraculously feel better before even using the dope?

    "selftext": "I‚Äôm writing this just in case there‚Äôs anyone else in my situation. I was finding it super hard to find specific information on the withdrawals from the ‚Äúpercs‚Äù that I‚Äôve been taking for a few months. I am 21M btw. I‚Äôm just hoping to tell my tale and hopefully it‚Äôll help at least 1 person ready to make the jump to recovery. \n\nI wasn‚Äôt super addicted compared to other users, I was only on them for just over 2 months, snorting about a pill a day give or take. I was told they were oxys by my friend who was supplying them to me, but turns out the motherfucker was giving me fent instead and lying to me. I had zero previous knowledge of pills or anything of the sort so I was pretty easy to fool. I believe he wanted to keep me addicted to these pills so he could feel better about his own addiction (he‚Äôs been on them for several years at this point) \n\nI was pretty worried and stressed about stopping even though I knew my WDs would be mild compared to others. They were very intense compared to what I‚Äôve felt before, but they were probably a walk in the park compared to most opiate addictions. I‚Äôm just sharing my experience for anyone who‚Äôs got their foot in the door with opiate addiction and want to get out before they get too deep. \n\nEven only 9-10 weeks into this addiction, the withdrawals were really fucking bad. Day 1 consisted of pretty regular withdrawals that I had felt while waiting for my boy to pull up when I was out. Stomach pain, burning tight chest, constant thoughts about the pills etc. Day 2 crescendoed into day 3 where the withdrawals were making it so I had zero ability to focus on anything besides the pain I was in. I wasn‚Äôt expected to literally feel like I had the worst case of the flue ever coupled with diarrhea and constant vomiting Day 4 it tapered off, and I managed to get 6 hours of sleep that night compared to the 1-2 I was getting the nights previous. I‚Äôm past day 6 now and I feel about 90 percent better, still having some cravings and burning in my chest and stomach areas, but other than that I am feeling great and full of energy. \n\nThis is a list of all the supplements and medications that I found helpful as FUCK during this process. Some of these were lifesavers. Most if not all these can can be purchased otc. \n\nKratom- dangerous game. I picked up a pack of 60 capsules (36 gs) to take during this period. DO NOT TAKE IT THROUGHOUT THE DAY. Take it only once when you are ready to try and fall asleep at night. You will not get addicted to the Kratom this way, and you can stop as soon as the withdrawals are past their peak. DO NOT TAKE IT MORE THAN 7 DAYS. Kratom helped ease the withdrawals by a considerable margin, maybe 40-50 percent, but maybe I got the wrong strain. Hella info on Kratom and shit here on Reddit tho. Recommend it, but avoid trading one addiction with another. \n\nVitamin C- I bought a tube of 10- 1000mg tablets that you dissolve in water like alka seltzer. I took 2000mg doses every 3 hours and let me tell you it helped so fucking much. Especially with the horrible fucking flu-symptoms I got. It really just helps your body feel not so sick and gives you a little energy to get on with you day. \n\nMucinex DM- cough syrup that helped my coughing sneezing and runny nose tremendously. \n\nShrooms- popping 1/4-1/3 of a shroom bar (1g-1.5g) took away literally every symptom. I felt like I was just having a mild trip on mushrooms with almost no WDs affecting me. Shrooms do what I expected Kratom to do. \n\nWeed- Hit or miss. I noticed if I smoked a bowl or two the withdrawals were lessened, but if I smoked more than that the weed made the withdrawals worse. There‚Äôs a good middle ground with weed in the situation. Don‚Äôt overdue it. \n\nBenzos- I have not personally used these to help with WDs as I had a very nasty Xanax habit in highschool, but I‚Äôve heard mixed reviews. Dude I trust who‚Äôs been through opiate dependency and withdrawals more times than I can count says that Benzos may help once they kick in, but after they wear off the WDs are worse than they would have been without the Benzos. Use them if you literally just can‚Äôt get to sleep and only if you have too, as the same ‚Äònight terror‚Äô effect may be produced because your body is trying to sleep but your mind won‚Äôt allow it. \n\nHOT SHOWERS!!!!! I was taking 5-6 per day. Turn the water on as hot as you can stand and just lay down for a quick 20. It‚Äôll make you feel amazing. If you have to, try and catch a few minutes of sleep in The shower if you can. Any sleep at all will make you feel better. \n\nZofran for nausea, Goodies Powder shoulder and back pain for the aches, and Tylenol for the headaches. Dramamine for the nausea of you can‚Äôt get your hands on zofran. Pretty much the only thing you can do while doing through WDs is treat the symptoms of the WDs and get past them. \n\nFor sleep, DO NOT USE MELATONIN. It literally gave me night terrors while withdrawing off fent. Valerian Root Extract worked well for sleep, as well as listening to music to put your mind off how shitty you feel. \n\nDrink at least 3 quarts of liquids per day. The more you piss, the faster this shit gets out of your body and the WDs start to taper off. I bought a shit ton of body armor and vitamin water, plus a box or two of some liquid IV. \n\nSpend time w people who love and support you. Block all of your dealers and throw  away all drug paraphernalia. Talk to someone about how you feel. You never have to go through this alone. Withdrawals for 9-10 weeks if use were pretty brutal and I can‚Äôt imagine how awful the withdrawals would be after years of continuous use. \n\nI‚Äôm gonna say it again, PLEASE STOP NOW HOLY SHIT. There is nothing worse than an opiate dependency, especially when they are street opiates. Shit is brutal. I hope this will help at least 1 person who‚Äôs in a similar situation as me because I found a lot of strength in other people‚Äôs stories and advice on Reddit. I almost didn‚Äôt make it though the week, and I can‚Äôt imagine what some of y‚Äôall are going through after years of opiate abuse. It‚Äôs kinda like that scene from One Piece where that guy felt 1 percent of Luffy‚Äôs pain. That‚Äôs how I felt going though these WDs because I know there‚Äôs mfs out there going through month long detoxes and literally living in hell for weeks after weeks because they stop this shit. For everyone that‚Äôs going through that, has been though that or are planning on doing so soon you have my respect. Taking the jump is maybe the scariest, most intimidating thing I‚Äôve had to do. \n\nThank y‚Äôall for reading, hope you guys stay strong. Stay sober. Smoke weed. Get up and experience life for the first time since the addiction started. You CAN do it, it‚Äôs just are you strong enough to do it? Don‚Äôt be a fucking pussy anymore.",

    "selftext": "Hey guys! Just wanted to post my experience for anyone who‚Äôs in a similar situation. \n\nI‚Äôve been an opiate addict for 10 years. \nI went onto Subutex maintenance 6 years ago. \n3 years ago I quit cold turkey in rehab jumping at 4mg a day. \nI‚Äôve been clean for the last 3 years that is until 3 months ago when I relapsed and started smoking pressed 30‚Äôs (fentanyl). \n\nI was smoking 10-15 tablets a day. I began to really hate myself. I was hiding this addiction from my amazing wife and my beautiful two boys. I couldn‚Äôt handle the guilt and I just wanted my normal life back. I would sit there, smoking the tablets in secret and cry myself to sleep almost every night. I knew I needed to stop. \n\nMy first attempt to stop was about 2 months into it. I foolishly tried quitting cold turkey and by the 48th hour I caved. The WD‚Äôs were so intense unlike anything I‚Äôve ever experienced. Suboxone, H, and Oxy pales in comparison. \n\nI contacted my Doc and got a Subutex script last month (July 10th). After reading so many horror stories about going into PWD 5 days after last dose of fentanyl, I was too scared to try. I couldn‚Äôt handle 48 hours let alone 100+ hours And don‚Äôt even get me started on the hell that is PWD. \n\nI week has gone by since I‚Äôve received my Subutex script and I still haven‚Äôt taken the leap yet. I‚Äôm scouring the web for a way out. I‚Äôm searching through /r/suboxone, /r/opiates, /r/opiatesRecovery and other forums for help. \n\nThe Bernese Method. \n\nAt last, my answer to a seamless transition to Subutex. Yes folks, it actually does work. I was skeptical as well, and there‚Äôs not much information on it. Everything I read is anecdotal (and so is my story) but there‚Äôs enough studies and enough ‚Äústories‚Äù on reddit for me to get enough information to try it myself. My timeline is as follows:\n\nI just want to say now that my Fentanyl dose does not drop the entire way through this entire process. I‚Äôm not going to write out my Fent dose for each day. Just know it stays at around 10-15 tablets/day\n\nDay 1: 0.5mg Subutex. No noticeable PWD symptoms\n\nDay 2: 0.5mg AM and 0.5mg PM. No PWD\n\nDay 3: 1mg AM and 1mg PM. No PWD \n\nDay 4: 2mg AM and 2mg PM. Mild PWD starting to kick in, easily countered using fent. \n\nDay 5: 4mg AM & 4mg PM. PWD really starts to set in but countered using fent. Daily fent dose increased by 3-4 tablets. \n\nDay 6-11: 4mg AM & 4mg PM. Subutex is officially in my system. I would continue getting mild PWD where I would combat it using Fent. During this phase I would never feel high from the fent. Albeit not in PWD either. Just normal. Fent dose stays increased through this process. \n\nDay 12: I abruptly stop taking fentanyl. The true Bernese method requires you to cut your Fent dose down slowly over the course of the program but I just couldn‚Äôt do it. I increase my Subutex dose to 12mg. I feel a bit of fatigue and hot and cold flashes but other than that COMPLETELY MANAGABLE. Sleep was fine. \n\nDay 13: Sub dose increases to 16mg (kinda pointless). I feel the same as I do on Day 12.\n\nDay 14. Stayed at 16mg. Feel the same. \n\nDay 15. Decreased dose to 12mg. Feel great. Almost no WD symptoms of any kind\n\nDay 16-18: Decrease dose 8mg. Feel totally fine.\n\nDay 19-22: Continue to cut dose down in half each day (4mg, 2mg, 1mg, 1mg) and then jumped. Almost no withdrawal symptoms. \n\nDay 1-4 Clean: Fatigue and chills, minor aching but sleeping totally fine with help from gabapentin and clonidine. No diarrhea or RLS or stomach cramping. No extremely noticeable mental issues. Completely manageable. \n\nOn day 5 today and I know Bup withdrawals can start today. But I know my body well and was on Suboxone for such a short time. I can‚Äôt imagine it will get much worst than this. This has been a completely manageable process thus far. Please send me good vibes for Day 5+üôèüèº\n\nMuch love to ya‚Äôll! ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nEDIT: Day 8 and feeling great. Symptoms have improved a bit every day.\n\nEDIT 2: Day 28 off subs, Day 38 off Fent and I feel amazing. This is a throw away account but I logged on this morning to check messages and someone DM‚Äôd me saying they tried my timeline and successfully made the switch to Subs. Please don‚Äôt be afraid to try the Bernese Method. It might sound counter-intuitive but it really does work! Peace and love to everyone! üôèüèº",

I was in my kitchen cooking dinner, when there was a knock on my door. \n\nWhen I went to answer I saw a dude in a white wifebeater and fancy ball cap that I didn‚Äôt recognize who was all tatted and blinged out. I talked to him thru my door until I realized he really did know me, then I went on the porch to talk. He knew my old car, described it to me - described my gf, knew some of my friends. He said ‚Äúyeah remember me? I‚Äôm (inset creative southern drug dealer name) U used to come thru (insert shady area name) with (insert shady ex dealer name) all the time! And you were spending some real money‚Äù. Uh yeah - I‚Äôm sure I was.\n\nAs I spoke with him I finally started to remember who he was, and the absurdity of the situation started to hit me - fortunately as he started his real sales pitch. \n\n‚ÄúYeah, I don‚Äôt know if you remember but none of that bs cut down stuff here. I been locked up awhile but I‚Äôm back and I got er‚Äôrhing good good.‚Äù When I told him I was clean, he tried to sell me coke, crack and dandelion wine. I could not make this up. I let him go on for awhile then thanked him for thinking of me but assured him that I was clean and quite done with dope.\n\nSo yeah, a dealer I didn‚Äôt even remember having, evidently because I‚Äôve had so many, on my porch, goods in hand, after all this time. And I got through it again. I always said that I‚Äôd be totally fine being clean unless it somehow ended up within my grasp or right in front of me. If that happened all bets were off, but I did my best to avoid the situation. You can‚Äôt avoid it if it literally knocks on your door.

By this point, im shaking already from alcohol withdrawls. I sigh as i get back onto the same pisss stained metal bunk, and I close my eyes, and i imagine im at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean alone away from all this.\n\nChow time i hear a CO it‚Äôs sounds like the longest grimiest fingernails on a chalkboard. My eyes open, and i start to shakingly get off my tiny little top bunk. Everyone is moaning their last names for roll call. I take a look around at everyones sad faces filled with tattoos and a distant look of regret. I muster up the energy to say my name. We follow each other in a chain gang one by one with hands in waste bands. Nuts to butts. Nutts to butts. The smell of food makes me gag as i fight down the urge to dryheave.\n\nLunch is shoyu chicken and two scoops rice. We have 5 mins to eat and not allowed to say a word. I stare at my food like it was roadkill and start getting nauseous i can feel the need to dryheave cometh. I stand up and gag as i power walk over to the lane of trashcans. Then continue to dryheave in a chowhall of 100 criminals eating lunch. Im wretching and nothing is coming out i look through my tears and see my food tray being picked apart by the vulturee seated around it. I scan the room, and everyone is just stuffing their face like they may never eat again. ‚ÄúEnochs you done?‚Äù A CO barks at me. I stick my fingers down my throat and and expell some bile like a cat does a hairball. As i lift my snot and teary eyes face out of the trashcan, and muster up the words ‚Äúyes CO sir.‚Äù\n\nThe next week was hell. i got no sleep. Shakingly, I‚Äôd lay in bed wretching into a trash bag. Even if i could sleep the sound of farts,snoring and belches filled my ears along with the moans of others either detoxing or crying. I‚Äôd spend a lot of my time in the bathroom stalls releasing my bowels of the liquid diet i was put on like lava from a volcano. Id read the graffiti and messages on the shit.colored wood stall door, carvings of giants dicks and phone numbers of guys  willing to suck those dicks while i sweated and shit. Then id flush and turn around and throw up. Some days, I‚Äôd masturbate to get a hit of dopamine depending on if someone hung a picture of a naked girl on the stall.door .I was so cold, and it was 95 with 100% humidity. Some inmates gave me their blankets because they they too, have been to these depths of hell. We were like brothers bonded by the dark hells of addiction. My bunkmate didint mind the constant leg kicking as he thought it as a massage  as it made the bunk rock for weeks.\n\nThe doctors gave me cold medicine and tylenol. 10 days and about 8 hours of sleep it commisary came. It was like christmas everyone was happy and for a couple hours everyone got along and even seemed like a scene from a movie. I got nothing. My mom had a restraining order on me  and rightfully so.  Inmates would toss a soup here and there onto my bunk out of pity. I sighed a deep sigh and closed my eyes this time i was at a top of a mountain alone and warm a waterfall was off in the distance alien ships zoomed over to me and beamed me up and brought me to a planet where noone knew me. Then a honey bun awakens me when it hit me square in the face. Compliments of jail house charity.  I take a bite and save the rest to savor later,like a prisoner of war in a labor camp, reminding himself of the times before the war and his aunt beatrices home cooked cinnamon rolls she would cook for him while he frolicked in the german countryside.\n\n4am its breakfast time. The lights come on, and im pacing the floors with a fm radio walkmen with a blanket wrapped around me. Lightning crashes. After my liquid breakfast of chicken broth and tofu, it‚Äôs shower time, a much needed shower. I go into the shower room, and it has 4 shower heads. The water was freezing and outside.Teeth chattering i took off my oversized orange orange MCC jail house attire. Dick the size of a broken tick tack. I step underneath the ice water and imagine im at the bottom of the Arctic Ocean. Then wash my tangled hair and balls. Two other inmates were showering that they were probably triple my size. Lots of spam. They laughed and said, ‚ÄúYou b alright brah, always darkest before the sunrise.‚Äù Teeth cackling i reply ‚Äúshoots. ‚Äù \n\nThe library cart would come by once a week. I read lots of books. I read the whole entire Harry Potter saga. I cried for my fantasy world filled with magic when it ended. I missed hogwarts. I closed the book and looked out my window. Big giant tropical green mountains with dark, angry clouds loomed over them. The smell of far away rain made me think of my dad. My dad loved weather and used to be a weatherman. I grew up loving the weather. I knew the name of clouds. When i was younger, I‚Äôd watch the weather channel all day long. The deep greens and reds of a radar are art to me. I thought about how bad it must be to have a son like me, and i started to cry for emotions that were flooding back. I cried hard as the rain started to fall outside my window,not letting any of the inmates hear me it was the most silent cry of my life, and it was also the most lonely one.\n\nI thank the gods that i got arrested  i would never be able to get off the methadone myself. \n\n",

The physical accutes lasted for about 14 days and the RLS didn't stop until day 40+.\n\nNow everyone's withdrawal story is different on Kratom but there is a reason the quittingkratom sub has so many users. Far more than this one. That should tell you all you need to know.\n\nI think most or all of us who use Opioids know they are bad, but there is a huge pro Kratom community who have Thier heads in the sand and will shout down anyone who brings up an issue with it. Pretty much every member of quittingkratom is banned from the Kratom sub for this reason. \n\nIf you are using Kratom to get of something else, you are just replacing one for another and prolonging the pain.\n\nThere are some success story's, for example someone might use it to get off heroin, and ultimately Kratom is relatively harmless per dose (but it fucks you up if used long term) but please don't use it as an easy way out because it's just going to prolong things.",

    "selftext": "So yesterday was the 4 year anniversary/ mark of the crime I committed which changed my life and initiated my recovery.  \n\n4 years ago I was charged with 1st degree robbery for passing a threatening note to a cashier to get money for drugs cause I was in bad withdrawals.  I went through withdrawals from heroin & suboxone in jail.  Bail was $100,000.  The first offer from the state was 10yrs 85% sentence. I said no and fought back.  I ended up getting downgraded to 2nd robbery and receiving drug court (7yrs 85% alternative).  Spent 6 months in a therapeutic community which really served me well despite how much of  a pain in the ass it was.  Worked a bunch of shit jobs when I got out.  No one would hire me not even retail stores.  Got a sponsor, home group and a strong network in AA - which essentially became my entire social life.  Did fun things with my sponsor & network like go to MLB games, NHL games, snowboarding etc.  After a couple years I got a huge break from someone in the corporate world who was willing to take a chance on me.  Now I have a better job with a violent felony record than I did in the years after I graduated college, having no record..... funny how things seem to just work themselves out if you keep doing the right thing. \n\nOn top of that I'll be graduating drug court before the end of the year.  Thats about 3.5 - 3.7 years of drug court for a crime that I would've served 5.95 years (7yrs w/ 85%) or 8.5 years (10yrs w/ 85%) had I pleaded to the first offer. This recovering addict is nothing but grateful today.  I'm back on my feet looking for a house, on great terms with family and life is peaceful.  So keep up the fight, do the next right thing, keeps things in perspective. It does get better.",

I hadn't been around her in over a year cause I've been clean for 2 and I had to cut ties. But this was my running buddy, my ride or die. We were always together, getting into trouble, starting shit, having fun, fighting, getting over it, and running the roads again. I still think of her on warm sunny days when we'd jump in my car and go hustle. When I had to get her fool ass out of jail. When I needed a place to crash and she had my back. She never let me be sick if she could help it. If all she had was a perc 10 she'd split it with me. She helped me move twice, she helped me fix my car when it broke down, she had her demons just like I did but she was deep down one of the best people I ever have met. She was so funny, way smarter than she gave herself credit for, loyal to a fault, determined and creative and so full of life. \n\nShe went off the deep end after her husband od'd. I found out she was gone from a Facebook post. Actually, not even a post, a comment. This happened over a month ago and I'm just now finding out. There was no funeral. No memorial. Not even an obituary. She was cremated I think by her family who for all I know just threw her ashes in the trash. I feel a deep ache in my heart and I wish I could cry but I'm numb.\n\nIn addition to her, this year I've lost 2 more friends plus one of my exes to overdose, and another to suicide. I'm just so sick of losing people. My brother got diagnosed with cancer this year too. I just really don't want to lose anybody else, this sucks. I want so badly to keep the ones I love here with me - both my brothers, my mom and my dogs...I can't handle losing one of them right now.\n\nBe safe out there guys, this fent ain't nothing to play around with. If you're clean or getting clean, save your own life and stay that way so people who love you don't end up posting stuff like this about you on reddit. We need you. Every one of you. You're important and we've all lost too many already. Remember this if you're struggling to stay clean. \n\nAnd 2020 can fuck right off.",

My friends told me they took the living room window out and threw everything in the front yard. All of my art, family photos, sentimental belongings, gone forever. Along with that he pawned his Harley he loved riding. His truck broke down and he couldn't afford to fix it so I gave him my car to use and I'm pretty sure he pawned it for a drug deal because he said his friend borrowed it and it's been gone for a year. Not to mention the thousands I've loaned him over the past 8 years. I just feel like they've taken so much advantage of me and I'm in school and feel like this is the time I need my parents the most and they're not here. He's also been withdrawaling about 20k a year in his life insurance funds and it will be gone in less than a month to opiates. \n\nHe brought my mom into his addiction, she looks like she weighs 90 pounds now. She is also 65 so this is going to kill her like any day I think her organs are going to fail. She will lay in bed all day until she gets a fix and will just jones for the next one. She has also made drug deals that I got blindsided into paying for. Like hey can you go pick up my stuff, I get to this dealers house and I'm told I am going to be paying for them. It's disgusting. \n\nThey guilt me into sending them money with a promise of getting it back when they get paid and the money never comes. And it's \"please help were so sick\" and I feel terrible. \n\nMy dad has overdosed 3 times, one time he gave himself naloxone, another time his friends saved him and the 3rd time he was in Vancouver and woke up in an ambulance. \n\nIt scares the living sh*t out of me. It's causing me so much depression. My parents and I are extremely close. Aside from just being my mom and dad they're the coolest most down to earth people you will ever meet and feel like my best friends. When they were straight we had so much fun together. \n\nThey came to visit me in the summer and I guess it wasn't a visit, they had a secret agenda for trying to find pills in my city. I watched my dad dry heave on my bed for hours until I had to scramble and go find something on the street to help him so he could get home. It was traumatizing. I watched him smoke fentanyl off tinfoil in my apartment. He's also brought me with him to trap houses where they would smoke fentanyl and it was the scariest thing I've seen in my life. It's been really hard on me. \n\nHe has no shame in the game anymore. He used to hide it but he will shoot up in my car after I drive him to a dealers house. I will come home to visit and he'll have his buddies over just shooting up on plain sight, uncapped syringes laid out all over the kitchen and coffee tables. And he will just casually be shooting my mom up in the kitchen like it's no big deal. \nI can't take it anymore. \n\nI am trying so hard to offer help. I told them they could come stay with me and I would take them to the treatment clinic and get them on soboxone or methadone and even pay for it. They won't. It's all okay we will do it next week, next week never comes, or they just need a few pills to get them by then they'll go in when they're out because they can't go to their appointment without a fix and it's just another excuse to get more pills. \n\nHow can I seriously get through their heads and help? If they die from this I will never forgive myself for not doing enough. I just don't know what to do when I've done everything I can. \nI stopped giving them money so I am not longer enabling but that doesn't stop them from asking and hounding me when I'm in class blowing up my phone begging me for money it's so heart breaking. \n\nI need advice please.",

Maybe that was a coping mechanism, or just my mind‚Äôs way of handling something that was difficult at times. \n\n\nLately, I‚Äôve been truly enjoying my free time again. There have been no physical symptoms for many months now, and the mental symptoms are so slight now that I‚Äôm not even sure if they could be considered symptoms. I‚Äôve climbed the ladder at my new job and got promoted to GM of a $2M/yr business with 1100 customers‚Ä¶I have a good salary and benefits, and I can provide adequately for my beautiful son. \n\nIf you‚Äôre feeling ready to begin the end of your journey on suboxone, I want to encourage you to find the strength within yourself to go for it. Be patient with yourself and get 1% closer to your goal each day‚Ä¶Time will pass, you will survive, and you will make it to the other side‚Ä¶those of us who have been addicted and conquered addiction develop a unique and special perspective that the world needs more of. \n\nHappy to be posting this today. Good luck to all of you on your journey.",

    "title": "10 Days Fent free...my story, my WD, my advice...",
    "selftext": "**STORY**: Got sober at 21 and was a rockstar in recovery for 10+ years. Got complacent during COVID and isolation got the best of me and loneliness is a trigger..and relapsed. 16 months of using. Day 1 was a single 30mg oxycodone I got from a friend. (taken orally). Day 365 (1 year later) I was snorting 30 fake M30's/day. This disease is fierce, cunning, progressive, and as addicts we find ways to rationalize the money, the use, the neglect of others in our life.\n\n**WITHDRAWAL:** At 35, this was the first \"REAL\" WD I've ever faced. I tried stopping at 4 months and thought I had COVID. How naive I was...as one Redditor put it \"welcome to the bropriate game fam\"! I wanted out immediately when I felt like I was dying (quite literally). But that FEAR...that voice that said \"you cannot\" that voice that said \"why go through that?\" that voice that said \"just a few more weeks\"..keep me in addiction another 12 months where I don't think ANY single dose made me \"happy\"...it made me feel \"normal\". But I had randomly caught an episode of intervention on TV and thought \"my God..that could be me\". We all have our own \"bottoms\"...for me, I could vividly see losing everything I had as I spending about $5,000 a month on drugs for a year.\n\n**BUT I PROMISED ADVICE...well, here it is:**\n\nNumber 1) **\"It's bad..but not THAT bad\"**. I have a beautiful paramedic ex gf who I contacted and told her what was going on. I thought she was going to say \"Oh my God....fent WD is going to be the hardest thing of your life\". She did NOT. I will quote her...\"You FUCKING pussy! Yes, it will be a struggle, but you want to see pain? Watch someone on benzos having a seizure as they bite their tongue off...that's pain! Suck it up, stop using, and in 1 week it will be over. Watch some movies you weak bitch!\" She was not entirely wrong. I had bad cramps, I had some very negative thoughts, I had cravings, I could not sleep, I had gut wrenching anxiety...but I DID NOT feel suicidal, have a seizure, was not vomiting on the floor, diarrhea was non existent with the help of Imodium. So basically...it's a really bad flu...you WILL BE OK.\n\nNumber 2) **MUSIC** \\- it saved me..not once, not twice, not three times, it saved me everyday. PM me for songs if you want, but I made 2 playlists. (1 that was hardcore hip hop to really say \"fuck you\" to fent and one that gave me the feels and reminded me this disease is not my fault, and I deserve happiness. Halsey's \"Gasoline\" for whatever reason...hit me harder than any other song at any other time of my life has hit me....not quite sure why...but just sharing. SO MAKE YOUR MIXTAPE(S) and PLAY THEM DAILY.\n\nNumber 3) **Comfort Meds.**  r/opiates has a sidebar with a WD guide...READ IT. It lists every comfort med. I used clonidine for anxiety, gabapentin for RLS, and xanax (not recommended) for sleep.\n\nNumber 4) This is a MUST...**BE KIND TO YOURSELF. BE PROUD OF YOURSELF**. You WILL feel guilt and shame...it will pass. Beating yourself up will lead to relapse. FORGIVE YOURSELF for the mistakes you've made. It's in the past. You can't change it, move on. You will want to self loathe...you will want to be mad at yourself...that is your disease telling you that you're not strong enough. I don't care what you did in addiction or the issues you caused, you need to let that shit go NOW AND FIGHT IT.  You can always make amends once your sober in a different place, but if you want to beat WD (the easy way) when your mind starts telling you how low your self esteem should feel...you NEED to think forward about who you can be, not backwards at who you were.  The point of recovery is to open a new chapter of your life and YOU WILL be a different person. One life can be made up of many different story lines and we do change as people, embrace the change.  So let it GO, NOW! WD is HARD, it's a BATTLE against yourself...YOU..CAN...WIN. But not if your general is berating the troops calling them all shitty people and putting them down. Put your arms around your soldiers (yourself in this analogy) and say....I'm sorry I haven't been the general you all needed, I'm sorry I let you down. But not today. TODAY...you get a pissed off general who is going to destroy the opponent. and when we go to war, there will be victory. So get your helmets on and strap up...it's a new day soldiers!!!\n\nNumber 5) **FEAR IS ONLY SCARY WHEN YOU REFUSE TO LOOK IT IN THE EYE**.  The basis of our identity during addiction is FEAR.  It convinced me, to my core, as real as something I could touch...that I was not strong enough to to this. I've heard it said ***\"the best things in life are on the other side of fear\"***.  When I finally decided to get what I needed to detox at home, against all the odds, against countless Redditors telling me \"I wouldn't be strong enough\"..HERE..I...AM! This is not some \"home run victory lap\".  There is work to be done in my recovery, but we can ONLY take this one day at a time.  And you need to celebrate your wins and feel good about yourself.  Let me tell you as someone who had long term sobriety.  Time is not a tool to stay sober.  Somebody with 15 years of sobriety is no better or worse than someone with 10 days like myself. (they of course have more experience against this disease)  But the strength of your sobriety is based on the quality of life and happiness in my humble opinion.  But once my detox began...and it sucked, and I was in pain, and I wanted to use....I had moments where I said \"I honestly thought this would be harder.  I can't believe I was so afraid for so long.  This hurts, but I can survive this!\"   BUT YOU HAVE TO FACE your addiction...but I promise you this..the SECOND you really do....you are stronger than you think...BELIEVE THAT!!!\n\nToday is ONLY 10 days sober. My 10+ years of previous sobriety are gone (BUT NOT forgotten). I know what it takes to stay sober, and you HAVE to forgive yourself....so feel proud fo your journey...every...SINGLE...minute! For me, I'm emotional just thinking of how glad I am to where I am at Day 10 with pretty much all anxiety and physical WD gone. Some fatigue, but I am PROUD.\n\nI WISH YOU ALL LOVE AND SUCCESS AND THANK YOU FOR READING.",

    "selftext": "*TRIGGERS - drug names, experience descriptions, IV/needle mentions warning!!! TRIGGERS!!!\n\n\n\nHey, I‚Äôm 495 days clean off opiates and a bunch of other shit today, 500 seems like a milestone, but I feel I‚Äôm at the point where I‚Äôm not anxiously waiting for the next month, to say I‚Äôd have X months clean/sober. \n\nToday, I received and installed my new RTX 3080. Before my opiate and especially meth addictions. I loved computer hardware and software, gaming, programming, etc. I‚Äôve assembled/built my own desktops since I was 12-13, was always a great hobby that I really enjoyed. And it made me interested in computer hardware, which led to me pursuing a compsci degree in 2018 (dropped out because of my addiction to opiates and benzos however).\n\nAfter feeling the greatest pleasure, euphoria, whatever, mankind has to offer. In the form of IV furanylfentanyl and alpha-methylfentanyl/China white. If you‚Äôve experienced fentanyl or any of its various analogs through IV use. You know what I mean. That rush is unparalleled by nothing else, heroin and meth don‚Äôt even touch it.\n\nHowever, today I finished putting in my new graphics card, and when I got it booted up, set up, ran benchmarks, etc. I found myself genuinely enjoying myself, like I was a kid again. Almost made me cry to be honest, and that‚Äôs ok, I learned it‚Äôs ok to cry. I‚Äôve been numbing my emotions for so long with so many drugs, it‚Äôs time I feel and express these repressed emotions.\n\nI know it‚Äôs a small thing, but it made me happy today, and happiness is rare for me to find. I‚Äôve been struggling recently, wanting to go back, to feel nothing again, the bliss calls me. So far I‚Äôve been able to refuse. I know what drugs like heroin and fent bring, lying, stealing, falling out, abscesses, missing shots, having to get new rigs or just reuse the same one 20 times and shriek in pain with every poke.\n\nToday, I‚Äôm not going back to that, today I will stay clean. I know personally that I have no power over opiates, once is too many, and a thousand never enough. If I go back, I‚Äôm dead unless I somehow have another wake up call, and I know my luck has run out.\n\nHope you‚Äôre all having a good day, no matter how much time clean you have, cherish it, but don‚Äôt fixate on it, don‚Äôt let it consume you. Clean time can become an addiction like anything else, and a relapse when you‚Äôre in that mindset is fucking shit to put it lightly.\n\nI‚Äôm still not fully happy, satisfied, whatever. But maybe I need to accept that I‚Äôm not going to be the same person I was prior to my addiction.",

    "selftext": "2 years 8 months and 17 days ago I used Heroin for the last time. Honestly, I was so sure that I would spend the rest of my days living the hell that is opiate addiction. Sometimes I think maybe I nodded off and I‚Äôm just having a really pleasant dream for once. And the thought of waking up from this brings me crippling anxiety. \n\nIn my eyes, this is my biggest accomplishment in life thus far. Every single day is a struggle. But every day is no longer a struggle to get well. No more waking up every day and having a good 30 min to hour long cry because I didn‚Äôt die in my sleep... but woke up, yet again, in my hellish nightmare of a life. No more excuses/lies to bosses and coworkers about the ‚Äústomach bug‚Äù I came down with again, but ‚ÄúI‚Äôm feeling much better than I look!‚Äù because dope sick was not something I considered a worthy reason for me calling out sick. No more struggling to hide the fact that I was 115lbs at 5‚Äô11 by layering 2 pairs of leggings under my jeans and at least 3 shirts and a hoodie under my coat. I wasn‚Äôt fooling anyone but the shock and pain in people‚Äôs eyes when they saw me without all the layers... somehow always caught me off guard. \n\n‚ÄúOne. Day. At. A. Time.‚Äù My mom drilled this into my head all day, every day for that first year. I still repeat it to myself daily. That‚Äôs all I can do, get through this day and I‚Äôll have one more day of freedom to look forward to.  \n\nI‚Äôm far from perfect and have other issues/addictions to work through... but I‚Äôve never regretted quitting heroin. Everything SUCKS right now and we‚Äôre lonely, anxious, bored... those thoughts creep back in so unexpectedly. About a year ago someone on reddit told me to read the book ‚ÄúIn the Realm of Hungry Ghosts: Close Encounters with Addiction‚Äù by Gabor Mat√©. I finally ordered a copy for myself and one for someone who needs it. I‚Äôll admit, that was actually in April but I knew I would know when someone needed it. So if you‚Äôre struggling to hang on, in recovery or active addiction, the loved one of an addict... and this book might help you or someone you love in any way let me know. I‚Äôll get it on it‚Äôs way to you üñ§",

Is it a different smell depending on what opioid you're withdrawing from?\n\nI find this really interesting and have always wondered about other people's experiences. \n\nTo me (with fentanyl), it's a very dull, kinda sweet-ish smell. Hard to describe but I know, once I start noticing it, that the \"real\" withdrawal has begun. It comes way after the sweating and chills set in.\n\nA little tangent:\nIt's funny a friend of mine (whom I've been trying to detox off fentanyl at home with) once said \"eww, go away, you smell like withdrawal!\" I think it's interesting why he thought it intensified once I got near him. (We were both in full blown wd.)  Could one in fact have a different body odor noticeable to others during detox? Maybe just like a person starving might at some point smell like acetone sometimes due to ketoacidosis?\n\nI was just thinking about this and find it really interesting. How and why does this happen? I'm sure any of you who use drugs IV notice a very distinctive smell/taste with each drug they shoot. At least I do, and it's different with every single one (heroin, fentanyl and cocaine). \nI wonder why that is, just as much as I wonder how the hell yawning is connected to opioid-withdraw.\n\nAlso, if anyone has any scientific stuff about any of this, that'd be very interesting!",

I messed up.. and it sucks.. but I'm getting out while I think I can. \nI am currently about 24 hours without.. and I have 4 mg subutex that I'll start when I'm hurting. Maybe 36 hours in.. longer if I can. After that, I have 4 8 mg strips to baby. Once I get back in that routine a bit, I'm going to ask for the vivitrol I believe. \nMy dealer is currently out.. and it's helping me to commit.. please don't let me get that message.

    "selftext": "I hate that people who aren't addicts treat addicts like we are less deserving of happiness.\n\nI saw a post in baby loss (I have had 2 miscarriages since I've been sober). This woman had just given birth to a baby that was alive but unlikely to live. I feel for her. I wrote an empathetic post. \n\nBut she was upset about her infertility challenges and made a comment \"even heroin addicts can give birth to babies but I can't\" and I won't lie- it hurt \n\nOne because of the assumption that heroin addicts don't have fertility issues too? But also because it's clear in her eyes heroin addicts are less deserving people on a whole and this idea that we are monsters. Like we just woke up one day and decided we wanted to be addicts. When the truth is alot of us has very traumatic things happen to us- a lot of has had horrible childhoods or were victims of domestic abuse (this was my case) we have suffered and grieved just like anyone else. A lot of times we've had so trauma that it's what brought us to find comfort in drugs. It was this idea that heroin addicts  some how aren't deserving of leading a happy fulfilling life as much as anyone else.\n\nObviously I wasnt about to tell a grieving woman who is about to take her newborn off life support that addicts are human and suffer just as much grief and loss as anyone else and are very capable of making good parents- I'm not a jerk- I know when ppl are grieving they say stupid things \n\n- but I had to get this out some where so here I am\n\nEverything we have learned about addiction shows is truly progresses like a brain disease as it changes our brain \n\nIt literally changes our prefrontal cortex- the part of the brain that tells us we need water and food to survive-- well when you do opiates long enough your brain adds in that you need those to survive too-- so your brain is literally telling you that in order to survive you have to use \n\nAddiction isn't a character flaw. It just isn't. I have my bachelor's in psychology and am working on my master's and my passion is fighting for addicts and victims of domestic abuse and helping them to findthemselves again \n\nAnd no I am not going out and saying active addicts should have babies-- but I also don't think they are any less deserving as anyone else because we are humans too. Every life has equal value and worth. \nAddicts are just like anyone else - addicts also face fertility problems and when addicts in recovery do become parents they face a whole extra set of problems most parents don't face. Life is already ten times harder for us.\n\nI also can't count how many times I've met women who got pregnant when they were  using who got into rehab- quit and fought everyday to be a good mom or a good dad. They fight for their sobriety as hard as they can- they work extra hard to I work with these women and they love their kids, even the ones who use still love their kids. Many of them give their kids up for adoption because they fear they will never be capable of being a good parent and they give that loss as well.\n\nAnd yes, many times they aren't in a position to care for them or are able too-- many times the ones who do keep them neglect or abandon them-- I'm not looking at this through rose colored glasses- but are we really going to sit here pretend that there aren't plenty of ppl who are not addicts that don't have these same issues. Everyday you here stories or parents abusing, neglecting, abandoning and even murdering their kids and they are not addicts. So why do people specifically hate it when addicts- even recovered addicts have children \n\nI have two children. I had a miscarriage long before children were a thought. But once I did get sober  - I had two miscarriages in between then and then had my second child just 4 months ago. \n\nI was physically abused for 4 years by my high school sweet heart who went into the army and came home from Iraq a different man. He kicked me in my stomach specifically to cause a miscarriage. He succeeded-- and he also broke my ribs. He went to jail. I was left alone grieving the loss of my baby. The Vicodin they prescribed me for my broken ribs offered me comfort and warmth when I didn't have any other support. I then went on to become a full blown IV user within a year.\n\nAfter 6 years of using and lots of failed attempts I was finally able to get sober. I went to therapy. I got my shit together. About a year later I got pregnant (unexpectedly). I had a beautiful baby boy that gave me purpose and brought my life so so so much joy. I was sober before I had him but struggled a lot- but after I had him I found myself waking up for the first time in years not being able to wait to get out of bed and hold this little magical human that I created. My kids didn't fix my addiction but they most certainly helped me heal. I didn't have to fight to stay sober- I found myself loving sobriety. I have no doubt without children I would have gotten there- but my son filled my life with a light I didn't know existed.\n\n The thought that some people think I'm less deserving of that because of my addiction makes me so sad and hurt.\n \nI am a great mom. I'm a human mom but my kids are at the center of my life. I provide them unconditional love, safety, security, shelter, food, toys and everything any parent should be providing. \n\nI now have almost a decade of sobriety under my belt. I want to tread carefully because I don't want anyone walking away from this post thinking if they just have kids they will be healed- because it doesn't work that way. Many women have kids and especially post partum struggle. Kids don't make your addiction go away at all-: but at the same time it doesn't mean we aren't deserving of having children or capable of being good parents\n\nBut I will say I'm unsure id be doing so well without them- as a key part of recovery is having purpose - and for me that was kids but for other ppl it might be something else\n\n\nSo for anyone reading this who isnt sober or freshly sober or is like me in recovery please don't let anyone make you feel like your less deserving than anyone else of things that make you happy. Don't let anyone else make you feel like your sub-human or that your addiction is a character flaw. It's not \n\nDon't let anyone tell you you don't deserve a full life of happiness-- whatever that may look like for you. Don't let anyone tell you your addiction means you can't ever have children or are undeserving or incapable of being a good parent. I promise you-- you are deserving\n\nI really didn't mean for this post to be so specific about addicts and parents - Its more I'm tired of the general population feeling like addicts are less deserving or incapable of leading full happy lives with responsibilities.\n\nSociety tells us that  we should be ashamed and that we are undeserving of leading a happy fulfilling life like the rest of the population- and it isn't true. Every life has equal value and worth and we are all capable and deserving of recovery \n\nAnd I'm sorry- for my very long rant \n\nI just know for addicts Christmas can be a particularly hard time - and if any of you take anything from this know you are deserving of love and happiness as much as the next person",

The only words she could get out were help me.i said did you use, she shook her head and said help. She started to fallout,, and I remembered that someone had given us some narcan. I do one up her nose, she slightly came to. I grab my phone and try to call 911 as we go up the stairs to ground level so the EMT would reach her faster. I'm in a complete panic and so is our son who happened to be hanging out with me when this all happened. We get to the top of the stairs I yell for our daughter to call 911 and tell them it's an overdose. We get my wife into the living room and we're trying to keep her up and moving. Not knowing what else to do my son was pouring ice water down her back. Then she just collapses into the floor and quit breathing. Her lips were turning blue and nothing was bringing her around. I narcaned her a second time and did mouth to mout it took what seemed like forever but she finally came too. Finally the police show up to \"clear the scene\" because that's something they do around us before EMT or fire will enter. Because I narcaned her they said there wasn't much they could do but take her to the hospital. In the ER she was out of it...shit herself, started masturbating in front of everybody. It was a horrible night. \nThe next day after our kids spoke to her and etc she decided that was it. She started treatment, taking subs and has been clean ever since. This is the first 10 1/2 months she's been clean in 16 years. This is our first Christmas of her being clean in 16 years. I'm so fucking proud of her. I wish there was something I could say or do to show anybody else that getting clean is achievable. We take it day by day..but one day has turned into 1 week, 1 week into 1 month etc...God bless you all. I just needed to share.",

I am seeing those people in the low majority of numbers and thus, will need to remove myself.  Take care everyone...best of luck to everyone.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Tomorrow you can use, DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT STAYING SOBER TOMORROW...but just don't use tonight.  Can you do that?  Can you just not use right now and wait until tomorrow?\"  In that moment I would take a deep breath and say \"yeah, I CAN make it through tonight.  And as you can image, this same quote was repeated the day after as well.  Sometimes the thought of never using again is so powerful, so overwhelming it can seem impossible and lead to a relapse because one can so easily think \"there is just no way I can never use again\". Chunking down to a short time and saying I just won't use right NOW and I don't have to worry about tomorrow can be a powerful tool to get through cravings.  Sometimes we take it one day at a time..sometimes one minute at a time.\n\n*I am reminded of this because....*\n\nI posted yesterday how I am tapering off fent and many replies were \"bro, that's a pipe dream\".  \"Dude, you can't taper...if you're an addict you won't be able to\".  \"I'm sorry to say, but tapering doesn't work.  You will only use and then take too much and OD\".  I then thought about how I'll handle cravings during this time and I remembered the quote above.  All I have to do is the follow the plan TODAY.  I was allowed 8 pills in today's taper and ending with only taking 7.  And if I want to get high tomorrow I'll do it...I just won't use TONIGHT and I am doing it with a smile on my face.\n\nOh also, to those haters who say I can't taper down to 1 pill a day and then jump so I avoid WD...WATCH ME MOTHER FUCKERS!

I‚Äôve always been the type of person who thought that everyone else had the potential to make things better for themselves, but that I would always be stuck. During my last run, I lost nearly everything important to me. I lost my friends, I lost my significant other, I lost the trust of my family. My significant other had tolerated my shit for so long, and he finally realized the only course of action left was to kick me out. I have done so much shit that I regret. I stole from my family, I sold belongings with sentimental value, and I was constantly lying to everyone. At one point during my run, I cut contact with all my friends. \n\nWhen I finally got clean ten and a half months ago, I realized how much damage I had actually caused. I had hurt the people I loved the most, and I didn‚Äôt think I would ever be able to fix what I had broken, so I didn‚Äôt even try.  I didn‚Äôt reach back out to my friends to apologize or make amends because I figured they didn‚Äôt want to hear from me. Thankfully, I was able to start mending my relationship with my significant other, but the loneliness was still suffocating. There were so many times I wanted to just end it all. I was consumed by thoughts of all the different ways I could off myself. I wanted so badly to make things right, but I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to try.\n\nYesterday, I decided enough was enough. I reached out to my two best friends to apologize for my behavior and for being a bad friend. I told them how much I missed them and how I hoped they would be willing to give me a chance to set things right. I was expecting the worst, but I was greeted with only love and understanding. I had been such a terrible friend, but they welcomed me back with open arms.\n\nThings really are starting to look up. I‚Äôve been repairing my relationship, not only with my significant other, but with my family as well. Everyone has been so supportive and I am so fucking grateful they were willing to give me another chance. I‚Äôm back in school, I‚Äôm building credit, I‚Äôm saving money. And now I have the opportunity to make amends to my friends. Everything is a work in progress, but the important thing is to keep moving forward. I still have a lot of shit I need to deal with, but now I feel more motivated to do so. No matter how bleak things seem, we all have the ability to make a better life for ourselves.

    "title": "My Experience Using Ibogaine to Quit",
    "selftext": "Hello all.\n\nI'm pasting a write-up I created a few months ago below. This is how I personally quit Suboxone almost 8 months ago (Aug. 9th, 2020) using Ibogaine. I provided a little background and some detail about my experience. Feel free to delete it if it's not appropriate...\n\n<paste>              \n\n\nBack in the 60s in New York (free love and lots of drugs), the anti-addictive properties of ibogaine were discovered by a [heroin addict named Howard Lotsof](https://youtu.be/bc9bZY7x_wU). 36 hours after taking Ibogaine, he realized he hadn't had any heroin and felt zero WD. This is how it all started. Apparently he got many of his friends clean this way. Thus started his life's mission. 50 years later it's now pretty well known.\n\nMy background:\n\nI started using Oxy 10 years ago. Got up to a massive dose 60-90mg every 4 hours or so. I kicked using regular detoxes, went to treatment programs, etc. only to make it about a month before the craving became too great. It always seemed to be right about this time when a dealer would call with a huge shipment of new pills (funny how that happens). So, after 5 years of this, I decided to do what I swore I never would and go on Suboxone. I was on 16mg per day for another 5 years. I was interested in Ibogaine as a solution, but I was too afraid to try it. It seemed to good to be true. Well, after a decade of opiates, I decided to just go for it. I booked a 10 day stay at a clinic in Cancun, MX and went. I arrived on August 9th, 2020.\n\nPreparation:\n\nTaking ibogaine is a bit of a process. While under the influence it acts as a potassium channel blocker. Thus, it lowers blood pressure and prolongs the QT interval of your heart (not permanent). Thus, you need to get an EKG, blood work, and a physical before you take what's called a flood dose (massive dose sometimes up to 2 grams of Ibogaine HCL). People with cardiac issues can still use it, but at a much lower dose over a prolonged period of time (micro dosing). The challenge here is it's illegal in most countries, so in reality you need to stay in a country where it's legal during this process which gets expensive.\n\nThe dosing process:\n\nAnyway, after the prep work, they dose you based on your drug of choice. If you are on short-acting opiates like oxy or H, you generally don't need multiple flood doses unless your habit is crazy big. The people on short acting have the easiest time with ibogaine. This is ibogaine's sweet spot. I saw multiple people walk out of there with zero WD after one session and a couple boosters (smaller doses (200-300mg), but larger than a micro dose (10-20mg)). For long-acting, it's a bit different. Ibogaine will cover up the WD for the first week or so, but with the residual opiates in your system (long-acting), they can re-attach to the opiate receptors, at least partially. Thus, some WD symptoms start to return. This is why I needed another two flood doses (and a few boosters in between). Ideally, someone would switch to short acting opiates 4-6 weeks before going to an ibogaine clinic and they will have a much easier time. For me, I showed up on 16mg of Suboxone and felt great for about 8 of the 10 days. Did my flood doses and boosters, but some WD came back. This is why I said I felt 10-20% of the WD above. I was able to get this under control using a micro dosing schedule for another 10 days. Also, PAWS kicked in for about another week (about 30-40% of normal). All in all, the process was far shorter and less painful than if I'd just jumped from 16mg without ibogaine. I've heard nightmares of people quiting Subs who still didn't feel right after 6 months or so. If I had it to do all over again, I'd still do it. But, I'd really consider switching to short acting first. Because of the long-acting issues, some clinics won't take people on Subs or Methadone. And, if a clinic says they can get you off of Suboxone/Methadone WD-free, they are straight up lying. There is one who does lots of interviews on YouTube (if you've done any research, you know who this is) who straight up lies. They get people to do the interviews because the imply they may \"withhold\" the last dose of ibogaine unless people agree to an interview. Not saying they don't get people clean, they do. However, the advertisement that they can get people off of Suboxone with no WD is BS. Thus, you need to find a clinic that will spend the time, take the right precautions, and work with you until you are feeling good. There is a new documentary called [Dosed](https://vimeo.com/ondemand/dosedregent) which does a very good job of showing Ibogaine in action. It's filmed in Canada where Iboga is legal. Canada has actually legalized slow-release short-acting morphine use to get off of long-acting opiates. The clinics up there often use this before administering Ibogaine.\n\nMy ibogaine experience:\n\nThis is a complicated subject. Iboga is a wild one. I never felt high or out of control. I could open my eyes at any time and be right back in the room, so it's not really scary. At flood doses you need to be monitored via O2, BP, and EKG. Also, they give you an IV with fluid as you are laying in bed for about 6-12 hours during the experience. Thus, an RN should be in the room during this process. Ok, so I took the capsules and after about 45 minutes I started hearing a buzzing noise. I then put on a blindfold and earphones with some cool African music playing. The experience has been described as connecting your conscious mind with your subconscious. It expanded my ability to think and visualize things (mind's eye expansion). Your mind just sort of flows at a level of efficiency that I've never felt. My consciousness was pushed a bit out of the local dimension. This is the only way I can describe it. It's actually pretty cool. My first dose was all about healing. I could actually feel the iboga moving around my body healing my receptors. It even kind of talked to me (I know..I know). It was like, \"I'm healing your right eye, now your left, now your neck, now your back, now your brain..\" etc. I actually dozed off during this first process and it sent a shock up my back to wake me up. I actually said out loud, \"Fine! I'll stay awake!\"\n\nMy second dose changed my life. Without getting into too much detail, it showed me how my drug use effected those who care about me. I actually felt their emotions. I felt the rejection I made them feel. I cried for about 5 hours during this session. It was a powerful experience. This really did it for me. It made me face the effect of my lying, scheming, and even how checked out I was on suboxone. This was an important part of my iboga journey. When I saw my wife after the 10 days, I couldn't stop crying. I felt so bad for what I'd put her through. NEVER AGAIN!!!\n\nThe third dose was a bit smaller, so just more healing. After this is when the micro dosing started to keep me feeling decent while the suboxone worked it's way out of my system.\n\nHere I am almost 8 months later and I feel great! Was it easy, not really. However, it was a frickin' cakewalk compared to what I would have gone through jumping off Subs at 16mg.\n\nHere is a great clip from a longer Joe Rogan episode with Hamilton Morris. This is the part where they talk about Ibogaine: [https://youtu.be/HM8WDZIhs3M?t=4680](https://youtu.be/HM8WDZIhs3M?t=4680)\n\nHope this helps. Let me know if you have any other questions. As far as I'm concerned, Ibogaine is a fucking miracle!\n\nTake care!\n\n</paste>              \n\n\n\n\nUpdate as of 12/29/21 - I'm still clean. I haven't touched an opiate since Aug. 9th, 2020. Since February 2021, I've lost about 70lbs and can now run a 7 minute mile for 4 miles straight. I've also been studying microbiology and am learning to play the piano. For me, ibogaine changed my life.\n\n\n\nUpdate as of 9/5/2022 - Still clean. I'm now down about 80lbs. Been working out 5 days per week. Really watching my macros to get my bodyfat % down in the mid teens. My BF was over 35% when I quite opiates! Opiates are the last thing on my mind these days! Life is very good. Ibogaine is a miracle!\n\n\n\nUpdate as of 10/29/23 - Still clean. Wow, I can't believe it's been over 3 years. I live in a different world today. Best of luck to everyone fighting this battle!\n\n  \nUpdate as of 10/3/24 - Still clean. Opiates are just a distant memory now. I've now lost 100 lbs. Went from fat at 50% body fat 4 years ago down to 12% body fat. I live in a different world today. Not bad for a 53 year old. :) ",

I had an oxycodone habit that was costing upwards of $300+ a day and I wasn‚Äôt even getting high. My life was controlled by those little blue fuckers.\n\nBut even before the oxy my life was consumed with changing my state of mind in an attempt escape reality. You see i‚Äôve suffered from a number of health issues for years now that have greatly inhibited my quality of life and I was constantly trying to escape that pain with drugs and alcohol. \n\nAs an addict, I tried every way of trying to maintain a high without negative repercussions but I was never successful. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm only gonna drink and smoke pot on the weekends, I‚Äôm gonna take a bunch of acid/mushrooms/mescaline to come to this realization that I don‚Äôt need drugs, I can go back to casually using opiates, etc. I got it all figured out.‚Äù \n\nThose methods always worked for a short while, until they didn‚Äôt and I was lead back to what my heart truly desired - that blissful temporary escape from opiates. But everytime I went back, the consequences always got worse. The detox always got worse. My habit always got worse. No matter how long I stayed away, whenever I returned shit always got worse.\n\nIt wasn‚Äôt until I got involved with the programs of AA/NA did finally realize that there are only two realities for me: one where I am using and one where I am not. It took me a long time to come to peace with the fact that I cannot casually use drugs and alcohol because my whole life -social circle, free time, hobbies - all revolved around getting fucked up. \n\nI know a lot of people have been scared off from the rooms of recovery and for good reason. Just because people are clean (or claim they are) does not make them good people. I learned this the hard way when several people took advantage of my kind nature in the rooms. But please don‚Äôt let this scare you away, that is how people are in life regardless so you must be smart with whom you chose to associate with. \n\nToday my life is better. I have a good job, I don‚Äôt wake up dope sick, and I have my own place and a car. I‚Äôm not constantly checking my phone for the dopeman, or waiting in some sketchy parking lot for hours while I get ‚Äú5 minutes!‚Äù over and over. Am I still sick? Yes. I am still suffering with health issues that force me to be home bound (thankful to be working from home). Do I ever miss opiates? Of course. Especially during times where I feel powerless to my health issues, but I know that opiates do not provide an effective solution for my situation and that one is too many and a thousand is never enough. \n\nI would encourage everyone to give the programs of AA/NA a chance, but to really give it a shot. Get a sponsor, get a commitment at a meeting, try different meetings, meet new people (with caution). Don‚Äôt just show up and leave, make it a goal to share. \n\nThe most powerful thing I‚Äôve learned from the rooms of recovery is to take it one day at a time and to not stress about the future, this simple meditation has changed my life and allowed my to stay clean. \n\nI‚Äôve you made it this far, thanks for listening to my rant.

(Percs, roxies, hydros, and morphine are my other go to's) it's been well over a year of Dilaudid steady though. Before the Dilaudid, I was taking about 40mg of oxy a day for about 2 years. But I would cycle. 5 month on, one month off, 3 months on, 2weeks off, etc. Im 22 now, but when I was somewhere around 16 or 17 I fell deeply in love with Heroin. I managed to kick the Heroin by moving away from my home town, and it really wasn't too hard. But I just have no clue how to say no to opiates. I've been fucking with them on and off since I was 12.\n\nAnyway, now my girlfriend of 4 years and I are about to move in to our first apartment far away from where we have grown up. I decided to go cold turkey roughly two and a half days ago, and this is the first time I've had to deal with any of the bullshit that happened and it's fucking me up. I've taken 0.5mg of Xanax to try to stop the anxiety that is tag teaming the depression I have, and I don't know what to do.

Lie about taking pills, while high as fuck on them. All this while all of my plugs are constantly hitting my line telling me about the shit they have for sale, So all I have is me. \n\nI'm moving in 1 month and am doing this so that I can support my girl and maybe be a person who is worth a fuck and can provide something. I just see no end to this shit in sight. I want a future, but all of the suicidal thoughts I've had before this, are back in full effect, which make me not give a flying fuck if I even have a future or a tomorrow. I already dealt with manic depression and anxiety disorder before this, and this has just completely fucked it.  If you've read this far, thank you. This is the only spot I can vent.",

    "selftext": "I‚Äôve never posted here before but I‚Äôve read this sub religiously, and your posts were the impetus for me to quit. \n\nI was on prescribed opiates for 16 years. After that amount of time, even if you don‚Äôt move to something harder, you‚Äôll have quite the love/hate relationship with opiates. I was being tapered off as my doctor is retiring in a few years, and I was very close to suicide as a result of the pain and my chemical dependency fucking with me. In July I had enough - and I mean ‚Äòmade peace with every last facet of this situation‚Äô enough - and decided to quit without telling anyone, even my prescribing doctor. I jumped off 100mg of oxyIR/day. \n\nWithdrawal was brutal, PAWS more so (still is, of course, but manageable now). I‚Äôm not on MAT. I have nothing against MAT and think it‚Äôs an awesome resource for those who need it, but I didn‚Äôt want another chain to be elegantly wrapped around my ankle. I‚Äôm 38, and I‚Äôve spent virtually my entire adulthood with my opiate receptors flooded by pharmaceutical grade dope - and that reign had to end. Somehow I knew this was something I needed to go through, and in this way, for better or for worse - and I share this because I feel that we all have our own subjective take on sobriety, with one not being better or worse than the other so long as it works for that individual. \n\nIt feels really good to be clean. There is no more profound feeling in this world, and in this life, than experiencing pleasure, happiness and contentment while clean, especially when juxtaposed against the twin peaks of opiate highs and withdrawals. Also, not waking up in the morning in withdrawal due to the short half-life of oxycodone has to be on the short-list for my top three favorite things I can never share with normal people because they‚Äôll look at me like my head is on fire. \n\nAnyway, I want to thank you guys for sharing your stories and your struggles. You gave me something that I didn‚Äôt have whatsoever during that dark period of my life: hope, the motivation to kick, and the knowledge with which to do so. I‚Äôm grateful as hell for that.",

At around 6:30-6:40AM he woke up and immediately went to smoke more of them. I asked him not to but he still did it. He came back to bed after. He was nodding out but responsive, then i made him take a puff from his inhaler and he passed out. He was unresponsive, i tried slapping him shaking him nothing. Then i turned my flash on my phone and his lips were turning blue. I immediately started to panic and i woke up my dad and his girlfriend. His whole face was purple now. My dad helped me drag him out of my bed and on the floor, i performed CPR on him until the medics came and they revived him. Called his parents at the hospital stayed with him until he was discharged with them and i went to his house just now to say goodbye, hes going to detox/rehab today. I cannot get the image out of my head, he looked dead. I was crying so much praying that he wouldnt die. I love him so much, he loves me. Hes addicted and needed help but he wasn‚Äôt really taking action. Maybe this needed to happen for him to realize, but i cant stop thinking about what if i wasnt there, or what if i was asleep.

I had a 10+ year heavy IV heroin and cocaine habit. I was pretty much speedballing round the clock by the last year. And I would get oxy 80s off and on during that time too - that was when you could find the real OCs. I also had a 5 year attempt/run on methadone in there, which I abused and I was prescribed 2 benzos which I did not abuse.\n\nI cleaned up because I was backed into a corner that I couldn‚Äôt get out of with every aspect of my life- financially, spiritually, socially and career-wise.\n\nI did a way-too-fast methadone taper to give myself a softer landing. But my WDs lasted for months because I was coming off so many things. I got off heroin, coke, methadone, Xanax and klonopin. I still can‚Äôt believe I survived that.\n\nSince I‚Äôve been clean my life has changed is so many positive ways, and to a large extent I‚Äôve been able to start becoming the person I always hoped I could be.  I have achieved things I can‚Äôt believe were even possible for me. And I‚Äôm old! You young ones getting clean: the world is yours, believe it.\n\nQuick story: I had to get clean in the same neighborhood I used to score in - which has been a challenge. Today I was walking the dog, and up drives one of my main old plugs (who I hadn‚Äôt seen in forever), and he hollers at me out the window. He yelled ‚Äúhey MetaMeta it‚Äôs been 3 years right?‚Äù And I was like ‚Äúnope 4‚Äù. \n\nI swear he didn‚Äôt know my clean date. And of course it was implied that if I was not clean there was opportunity. But when I said ‚Äú4‚Äù he waved and drove off lol. I feel like that was some kind of sign from the universe but I‚Äôm not sure what it meant. Kind of blew my mind. I guess I‚Äôll take that as ‚Äúhey, this is your monkey... just letting you know I‚Äôm here when you want me...‚Äù You can‚Äôt ever let your guard down.\n\nEverybody keep fighting!

    "selftext": "It's tempting to feel like a failure when getting sober because, well, you did spend a lot of your life using drugs. And all the other stuff that comes along with that fact. But you're here. You made it. That's all the proof you need. So Be a success, own it. FUCK YEAH I DID IT! Not that people who die ARE failures, but that the intrusive thought that YOU're a failure is always a lie and should never be taken seriously, no matter what your \"past\" was like. It's all about perspective, the way you tell your story to others should be the way you tell it to yourself in your own mind, if you're sober right now your story is a success story, no catch, no exceptions. Own it. Congratulations. That's fucking awesome.\n\n Like everyone I've ever told \"I'm sober\" or \"I survived opiate addiction\" to or \"I was an alcoholic and almost died\", they're always SOOOO supportive, and always, ALWAYS, know someone who didn't make it, who actually died, and they're almost always overcome with emotion and compassion for me and so glad to see a SUCCESS in this world, to see something positive and beautiful.  I can tangibly feel their sincere gratitude that I AM a success, because I didn't let addiction Kill me, that I'm standing in front of them. You're whole life has lead up to this moment, think of all your fallen friends and artistic influences who's lives did not lead up to this, think of all the people who wanted them so badly to make it to where you already are, think of the suffering person you were who wanted nothing more than to make it to this moment, to say: I made it, I did it, I'm here, I'm fine, it's OKAY, finally.. And by living you honor them all, and you honor that person you were who wanted this so badly. Don't let that person's suffering be in vain. This is profound. Don't downplay how momentous an accomplishment it is to make it to one day sober, 2 days, 3 days... \n\n So I can't sleep and have been barely sleeping the last 3 or 4 days, and that's OK, because instead of laying there and letting my thoughts do a pointless negative loop in my head, I'm watching anime, commenting on posts, and writing this right now. I'm off everything, including weed, no comfort meds (I used the 20 valium I got  for withdrawls in a few days of course). So I got nothing. Except I have everything, as I believe everything is within and being sober allows you access to that everything you are, even if you don't feel it yet, it's coming. I was sober for 2 years so I know it's coming and it's there, you've just been cut off from it, from your pure self.\n\n It's over. I\"m just done now, with looking outside myself, I'm at the point of no return and that all addicts fear at some point. Jumping. I've done it before so I know this place I'm in and it's not forever. And I thought about getting some pot to comfort me and \"help me sleep\" but, for me, this time, I'm not going to do it that way, I'm going to try something new. I'm just not going to give in, because I do have that choice, I'm not going to put it off. I'm going to go through it. And it will pass. I'm not going to go buy tramadol (which I could do as I am in a country where it is OTC right now) to \"wean\" or \"taper\". I don't need it and I know it, I'm not in danger, I'm just uncomfortable, and that's not an excuse to risk my life. Because if I drink now, or get benzos, or even smoke pot, I could lose control and that could be it.  I'm just going to let my body heal and adjust with time and support.. And it will. It is. \n\nAnd so the biggest challenge is to keep my thoughts positive and loving towards my self and to believe this will get easier and better as it goes, as uncomfortable as it is to be coming off opiates and not able to sleep, it is still SO MUCH better than the hell of addiction or how it felt the first day, or second day.. I'm one week in off opiates. Two days off pot. I didn't sleep last night, it's 5 am, but I'm not a failure, and I'm not going to give up. And I'll get my precious sleep eventually, and when it comes I'll be so grateful I waited.\n\n Love to you all.",

    "selftext": "Today is my 5 month anniversary. I'm hoping I can share some encouragement that might help anyone thinking about detoxing or who's in the middle of it. Because I promise you that if I could survive the last 5 months, you can survive a week or two of detox!\n\nThis year I decided to come off a decade using high dose painkillers. Only 2 other people knew I was addicted during that time. Lived a successful life, great family and career, etc. I started using for a series of spinal injuries and ended up becoming addicted due to a series of emotional traumas. It was like a perfect storm. The pills gave me superpowers. I was able to  push my needs aside and focus on everything else that mattered. I knew I was addicted, but didn't think of myself as an addict. At that point I had been in episodic -- but not daily -- pain for years. My biggest fears were withdrawals and what would happen the next time I was in a pain flare-up. That kept me using for many years. I didn't think I was strong enough. \n\nThe first week went as planned. No sleep, awful RLS, chills, anxiety, pain, etc.  I found NA on the 3rd night. I was desperate for anything to help get through another sleepless night without using. This sub was amazing. I got some good tough love here when I asked about using some of the \"emergency doses\" I'd kept handy.\n\nThen on the 7th day everything changed. I had only slept a couple hours total in that first week and was pushing myself so hard -- doing yoga each morning, walking 1-2 miles daily, making healthy meals, etc. I just wanted to purge everything from my body as quickly as possible. but because I'm an addict I pushed way too hard! I injured myself in a yoga and ended up in urgent care by the next night.So here was the first flareup I dreaded - which had kept me using for years. My pain level was between a 6-9 day in day out, usually on the highest end. I tried to embrace it as a great test for my resolve...if I could get through a week or two in extreme pain then I was for sure serious about quitting!\n\nBut the pain never left. And it impacted every single area of my life - couldn't sit in chairs, walk, bend, lift, etc. Which means I suddenly couldn't clean, cook, work, exercise, anything. During detox I remember wondering how anyone in a wheelchair or severely disabled could ever get clean because exercising was like medicine! Now I here I was.\n\nI tried acupuncture, chiropractors, massage. Nothing helped but somehow I didn't take anything. 1 month in I got an epidural which also didn't help. 2  months in I got admitted to a chronic pain FRP (Functional Restoration Program), which is basically \"body rehab\" for 4 hrs each day, over 8 weeks. Didn't help, but somehow insanely I still haven't taken anything.\n\nSometimes it seems impossible to me that I've lived in this amount of pain for 5 months. No pink cloud yet, no life is so much better. The truth is life is hard and painful and some days I don't know how I'll get through. I still spend my days on ice packs, turning from one side to another and trying to push through. I eventually might have some tough choices to make down the road about the future. This level of pain may be what was underneath the painkillers or it might decrease as my brain heals. No clue yet. But no matter what I now have a beautiful support group with my NA family, and I am trusting that given the right conditions our bodies and brains can heal.\n\nSo for anyone out there who thinks they can't push through a few shitty days or weeks, dude if I could do THIS for 153 days straight, you so have withdrawals. I am not tough or hardcore or anything. And somehow I'm doing it one day at a time. You've got this!\n\nAnd if anyone out there is living in chronic pain and has some words of encouragement, I'm all ears.",

    "selftext": "The opposite of addiction is connection.\n\nThe addiction is not about the pleasurable effects of substances, it's the inability to  connect with other human beings in a healthy way. Many say addiction is not a substance disorder, it is a social disorder.\n\nA study had been done on rats that showed when putting a rat in a small cage alone, with one bottle of water and one bottle of heroin infused water the rat would choose the heroin water until it killed itself. They then put 20 rats in a \"Rat park\" with other rats, wheels, toys and lots of other resources. They also put a water bottle and a heroin infused water bottle. None of the rats chose the heroin infused bottle...\n\nMany of us addicts feel a major loss of connection, to other humans as well as to our true (higher) selves. Many of us alienate ourselves and lose ourselves while in our addiction pulling us further and further from the people we loved and who loved us as well as far away from the people we were intended to be. This leaves us feeling alone, broken with no real connection to the world. The only connections we have are people who do not hold our best interests at heart. We know this.\n\nIf we want to be well we must find true connection again. We must find our purpose and surround ourselves with people who align with it. People who are there to lift us up so we can lift them up. We must do the real work and for once go within ourselves to find ourselves again. Our truest selves. Only from within can we heal and regain our lives again.\n\nWe, as a society must also realize that we all have a little bit of addiction inside of us. It may not be drugs, however it may be sex, chocolate, the gym, smoking, drama, work, food, shopping, relationships, coffee, gambling, our phones or even sugar. We are all looking to fill an inner void externally to some extent. We will not grow as a society until we realize that not one of us are any better than the other. We have more similarities than we have differences!!!\n\nAnd after all we are all after the same things; love and peace!!ü§ü‚úå",

Gone for good. \n\nBut it put me in a weird headspace. That was the most I‚Äôve thought about pills in a long while. That was definitely the closest I‚Äôve came to using again since I jumped off last year. \n\nI just wanted to post because I needed a little support today after that.

I got clean 2 months ago getting off benzos, heroin, crack all at the same time.  I guarantee getting off all these substances is literally one of the hardest thing to do in the world. Ive been clean ever since, and right now i don't even have a single thought during the day of using nor do I even think about the drug. Im focussed on other things, hobbies, my job, and its something extremely new for me that I don't even have a thought about it. I was at a NA meeting the other day and I said my clean date. I later proceeded to mention I do smoke still. And someone shouted out your not clean. The people that came up to me and told me that they were offended that I smoke weed and call myself clean were at the meeting because they struggle with \"weed addiction\" . I actually find it extremely offensive that they are going to say that when stopping to smoke weed even after 10 year( ive done it many times) is literally a walk in the park. Not even. Comparing the two literally made me want to slap them(would never do that)thinking about all the shit I went through to get clean.. I know everyone has their own struggles. But it absolutely blew my mind that they said that.\n\nThey started recommending Rehabs for me to go to for my \"pot addiction\".  Listen I word a hard 70 hours a week.  I was able to get off crack ,heroin,fent/carfent, and xanax all at the same time.  And ive been able to stay clean for more than 2 months.. How are they going to telll me I need help because I smoke 3-4 times a month on the weekends when I am off to relax and sleep.  It is 100% my choice I havent smoked in 2 weeks not because Im trying because I simply don't have the time right now.

Been slowly dropping ever since, and I honestly can't remember what year it was that I had a legit *craving*. \n\nWell, early last week my 17 year old daughter had her wisdom teeth taken out, so of course the doctor wrote her a prescription for a small amount of Norco (20, I think).  Her pain was never too bad, so she only wound up taking 2 of them.\n\nMy wife and I locked the rest up in our safe in case our daughter got a dry socket over the past week, or something, while she healed.

    "selftext": "Not a lot of people in my life know that I had an addiction to Oxy. Only my parents and my husband. \n\nThis is long... probably no one will read it. But it's been 4 months since my dad passed away and 4 months since I've touched an oxy so it's been on my mind.\n\nBefore all of this I had been prescribed different things like Klonopin and Soma. I had been given morphine and dilaudid in the hospital. But never abused anything or took anything \"for fun\".\n\nIt started off when I was a server and a coworker asked if I wanted to sniff a Xanax with her in the bathroom. Work was slow, I was bored, and had tried Xanax before for anxiety so I thought sure why not. Fell in love with snorting shit. I know usually snorting things doesn't give the best high, but it was my choice RA. Crushing it, setting up lines, etc. Uhg. \n\nI also have chronic back pain and was prescribed tramadol. One month during my period, between cramps and my usual back pain, the tramadol wasn't cutting it. My dad gave me a couple of his 10 mg oxys to have. Then I got the idea to snort one. It was over from there. \n\nI mostly stole from my dad, sometimes he would give them to me when I asked. It started with just one two here and there. Then escalated. Idk how he never noticed they were missing. I knew he didn't take his whole prescription, 120 10 mg oxy/month, but damn be really wasn't paying attention to what he took. This went on for a few years without anyone ever knowing. I moved away, got married, had a baby, no one ever knew. I moved an hour away from my parents and when I would go home, which was usually every weekend for a day because my husband worked Saturdays, I would take a handful of pills from my dad. When I had my daughter my parents moved to be closer to us. One day my mom just happened to catch me taking the pills out of my dad's drawer. I had only taken two, so it didn't look too bad. She was upset because she said I knew my dad would give them to me if I just asked. What she didn't know was that my dad had already given me some. Around this time my husband also discovered my pad and straw that I kept hidden in my drawer. He knew I sometimes got Oxy from my dad, but now he knew I was snorting them. He confronted me and told my mom about it. My mom told my dad he was to absolutely not give me any more oxy. \n\nI'm a daddy's girl. My dad and I were very similar. I'm close to my mom too but we aren't alike the way me and my dad are. My dad and I both have addiction issues. He was an alcoholic (in the end this is what ultimately caused his death). He kept secretly giving me Oxy and I kept stealing them as well. He had started counting them and realized what I was doing. He started hiding them and I was no longer allowed in his room. But when I asked he would still give me a few. \n\nMy dad had liver cirrhosis from alcoholism but he never stopped drinking. Eventually this caught up to him. End of May he started getting really sick, but we didn't know there was actually an issue, we just thought he was drunk and taking oxy. He would nod off randomly, tell the same story three times in a row, forgot how to use things he used all the time like the tv remote, his phone, etc. But then one day he came to me and said he had too many oxy pills and could I count them and look at them to make sure they were all oxy. Weird and triggering for me, but ok I did it. There were a few non oxy pills in there for some reason, but also way too many oxys. His refill was due in 4 days and he had almost 30 oxy still. So I knew he wasn't high. We looked at his wine and he hadn't opened a new bottle so then we knew he wasn't drunk either. But he had a doctor appointment in a few days so we just blew it off til then. It was June by now.\n\nAt his appointment his doctor said he thought my dad had encephalopathy but he would need to run some tests. He sent my parents home while waiting for the results. He called a few hours later and told my parents to go to the ER and they would admit my dad to the hospital. My dad asked his doctor if he was going to die and the doctor said \"we all die one day.\" Two weeks later my dad was dead. I know it's super shitty, but I stole the rest of his oxy and snorted them all within a few days. I haven't touched an opiate or any other narcotic drug (except weed) since then. \n\nI know I was only able to stop because of the circumstances. If my dad was still here I'd still be doing oxy. In a way I'm really proud of myself tho, because I could have easily found somewhere else to get them or could have started another similar habit, but I didn't. Especially with the grief of losing my dad who was my best friend and knew me better than almost anyone I craved getting high so bad, but I didn't. \n\nA lot of days I still crave an oxy. I think if I could just snort an oxy, even half an oxy, right now I'd feel so much better. It's so hard even 4 months later. I finally understand what they mean when they say once an addict always an addict. I'll always be an oxy addict, I'm just no longer actively participating.",

It makes me feel strong and alive, helps me feel good about myself, and helps me sleep hard at night.        \n            \nI don't have a bunch of NA/AA crap to spout, but I did work through the steps once, and I stay in contact with a sponsor. It does wonders for some people - I've seen it. I'd recommend it to anyone in early recovery. I will likely stop going to meetings for good at some point.          \n           \nOne thing I will say is that coming out on the other side of this has made me into a new and different man, and my life is better than it has ever been before. I am fitter and sharper than ever, and I'm living life more fully than ever before.          \n             \nI love all of you. I wish you many days, weeks, months, and years free of heroin. NO MORE SUFFERING.       \n             \nPeace and Love",

    "title": "A legitimate miracle cure for opiate withdrawal",
    "selftext": "When you hear of anyone claiming to have found a \"miracle cure\", 9 times out of 10 it is probably BS. But this is not. I discovered something that truly IS a miracle for opiate withdrawal of any kind (herion, methadone, suboxone, kratom, etc) and I will spend the rest of my life telling anyone and everyone who will listen.\n\nHigh doses of Vitamin C has been studied and used for many years in the treatment of heroin withdrawal and the results have been astounding. Many doctors and scientists have fought to get the word out to the masses but it has been swept under the rug due to the amount of money that drug detox and rehabilitation centers would lose if everyone were aware of the true power of Vitamin C. \n\nHow does it work? \n\nEmpty opiate receptors is what causes withdrawal symptoms. Vitamin C occupies opiate receptors sites which is why it allivates withdrawls symptoms. When your opiate receptors are occupied, your body does not experience withdrawal. When the Vitamin C begins to wear off and leaves your opiate receptors, around 4 hours usually, your body goes back into withdrawal. It really does work and could help save SO many lives from opiate addiction if only more people knew about it. If anyone is interested in learning more about this, this video is very interesting: https://youtu.be/5jUCZpIGnUY\n\nDo your own research, try it for yourself and you will be convinced. As someone who personally used high does of Vitamin C to rapidly detox off of 24mg/day of Suboxone,\nI have some important notes that I want to share with you...\n\n- Vitamin C itself, even in *massive* amounts is nontoxic. However many Vitamin C products contain fillers or other vitamins which *can* be toxic in large amounts so you must be certain to purchase a product that *only* contains Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid).\n\n\n- You can not overdose on Vitamin C. Your body will absorb exactly how much it needs and you will poop out the rest. It is recommended to take Vitamin C \"to bowel tolerance\". Your bowel tolerance level will differ day to day depending on your body. If you are very ill, your bowel tolerance level will be higher because your body needs more Vitamin C. If you are healthy, your bowel tolerance level will be much lower. Because again, your body will only absorb as much as it needs.\n\n\n- The doctors who devoted their lives to studying the incredible power of Vitamin C all say the same thing \"take Vitamin C until you are symptom free\". If you are still experiencing withdrawal symptoms but have not yet reached bowel tolerance, then you have not taken enough. \n\n\n- Not all forms of Vitamin C are created equal. Vitamin C will not do you any good if your body can not absorb it. In my personal experience, I found Vitamin C tablets and chewables to be virtually useless due to their low and slow absorption rate. Vitamin C powder is absolutely the way to go. It absorbs very quickly. At the right amount, you will actually *feel* it working right away. You will feel a tingling sensation throughout your entire body and your withdrawal symptoms will quickly begin to subside. It may sound like magic, but as far as I am concerned, it truly is.\n\n\n- The amount and frequency that you will need will depend on the severity of your withdrawal symptoms on that particular day. Just to give you an idea, in clinical use, a daily total of 300mg/kg was used for patients in severe heroin withdrawal. I highly recommend taking it slow at first to get a feel for what your bowel tolerance level is. If you take too much, you may possibly poop your pants but that is the worst that will happen to you.\n\n\n- During the worst of my withdrawals, I needed 5,000mg three times a day to subdue my withdrawal symptoms. If I did not redose right before bed, I would wake up in the middle of the night right back in agonizing withdrawal. Towards the end of my detox, I only needed 2,000mg per dose. Once you feel your withdrawal symptoms beginning to creep back up, it is time to redose. \n\n\n- You do not have to use organic Vitamin C.\nSythenic Vitamin C has been studied and proven to be equally as effective in treating opiate withdrawal as natural Vitamin C. \n\n\n- This is what I used: https://www.amazon.com/BulkSupplements-Ascorbic-Vitamin-Powder-kilogram/dp/B00AYIM9Y8/ref=mp_s_a_1_2_sspa?keywords=vitamin+c+powder&qid=1562455363&s=gateway&sprefix=vitamin+c+p&sr=8-2-spons&psc=1\n\n\n- Lastly, and I can not stress this enough, DRINK WATER!!! You must keep yourself well hydrated!\n\n\nVitamin C for opiate withdrawal is something that I wish was talked about more often. But sadly as we all know, if it doesn't make the pharmaceutical company money, then no one wants us to know about it. Even doctors will pooh-pooh the idea but you can not dispute the fact that it truly works.\n\nMany folks are using Kratom to get through opiate withdrawal and although it *is* incredibly effective, you will likely be trading one addiction for another. Vitamin C is just as effective, even more affordable, very safe and is not addictive. Opiate withdrawal is just one of the countless things that Vitamin C is miraculous for. You will not only be amazed at how much better you feel in general, but how much better you look as well! \n\n**Disclaimer: I am a recovering opiate addict sharing my own personal experience and the things that I have learned along the way in an attempt to help others out there like me. I am not a doctor and I encourage you to *always* do your own research.**\n\nIf you have a friend going through opiate withdrawal or who wants to get clean but is scared of the detox, please share this with them. It is truly a life saving tool.\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è EDIT: DO NOT USE IN LARGE AMOUNTS IF PREGNANT ‚ö†Ô∏è",

    "selftext": "Ive been prescribed suboxone for 10 years. I used heroin for the last time in 2010, and I'm grateful to say I never went back. I never even considered it. I scoffed and rolled my eyes at those who didnt consider me \"really sober,\" and to an extent I still do.-- I dont frequent this subreddit, and I dont know the culture around subs, but I've also lived with the stigma of being a sub user for 10 years now. To say its highly subjective is an understatement, and most people have a negative view of suboxone. That's fair. I can agree that it's very often misprescribed.\n\nHere's what I know. Suboxone allowed me the stability and motivation to get my fucking life together. I got (and kept) a job, a car, a home, a beautiful daughter, an amazing girlfriend, and a college degree. I mended broken relationships, and I now have a support system I'm so so grateful for. \n\nI probably would have blissfully continued my way if it weren't for the side effects I've started experiencing. As a 28 year old woman, I have low estrogen which is causing horrible acne, hair loss, and I suspect low energy as well. I never spent adequate time in therapy or any sort of self help program, therefore I still struggle with a great deal of untreated mental illness. My toxic behaviors and coping mechanisms just arent cutting it anymore. \n\nBut I can stop this madness. I'm 24 hours into detox. I have 2 therapist appointments set up, and my family has thankfully agreed to help out. I do have past experience with quitting subs cold turkey (detox center when I was 24.) The withdraws didnt really kick in until 14 days and it was hell on earth for the following 30. It got much better after that, though I was a fucking idiot to pick it back up again. \n\nIf you took the time to read this, thank you. I realize its jumbled and somewhat of a vent, but I needed to write this out. Perhaps I can find strength and sobriety in the group, i know I need all the help I can get. \n\nI'm scared of what this next month will be like, but I'm more scared of suboxone. I want my freedom.",

Last year, when I went to detox to withdrawal from Methadone, I unknowingly bought a ticket to places and things I thought were unreachable for me. On this journey, I‚Äôve found happiness. Not a fleeting sensation brought on by ‚Äúlove‚Äù or the acquisition of any object, but a sustainable wholeness within myself. I found that elusive self-confidence that for my entire life escaped me. The sacred, apathetic, and nihilistic based thinking has begun dissipating and is replaced with self-worth and care. Not only for myself but for others also.\nThere is something amazing about coming to the realization that I have something to offer the world, and to be fortunate enough to be of use. It‚Äôs been a wild ride. My mother died from alcoholism; about 5 months into sobriety. I called others and cried in meetings. I needed to be vulnerable. I used to think I was a special snowflake with an immeasurable pain that others couldn‚Äôt comprehend. The truth is I just never talked about the way I felt. As a result, I closed myself off from the world. Through recovery, I‚Äôve found a way to relate to everyone and my world opened up in a way I never thought possible.\n\nThere is a lot of work still to be done. I am often lazy, I still vape, and over eat. But as I've seen it's progress not perfection. I've lost 50lbs over this year from light exercise and not eating (as much) ice cream. I signed up for and passed 3 classes (71.8 in spanish but I'm proud of that C).

    "selftext": "3 days and 17 hours since my last line of heroin. The other side is just hours away. But man, this detox was weird. What was supposed to be day one was a desaster. I did very little heroin the day before and waited about 20 hours before I started with 4mg subutex. No PWD, but not much relief either. So I did another 4mg and barely made it through the first half of the day. So another 4mg. And when 12mg buprenorphine wouldn't make me comfortable, I was quite desperate. Desperate enough to relapse on heroin at 10 PM. The heroin had little to no effect, all receptors blocked. But I slept like a drunk baby ‚Äî and the next day, I felt fine. Like, really fine. So I decided to wait for withdrawals to hit me again before I take my next dose of subutex. It's been over 3 days, still waiting. I can't believe it, but I cheated withdrawal somehow. I mean, sure. I AM in withdrawal. It's just so mild that I don't count it. Cold chills, sweats, mild stomach discomfort, unstable mood...but soooooo mild. Totally bearable. I even hung out with my family on the weekend and had fun. On days 2 and 3 of heroin detox.  \n\n\nThat's crazy.   \n\n\nOh. And I turned 40 yesterday. I wanted to be clean for my birthday and stay clean for the rest of my life. First part is a success.",

    "selftext": "Hello guys, I hope you‚Äôre all doing well. \n\nAs the title states, this February 12th will be exactly 15 months into my recovery from Heroin. Or:\n\n‚Ä¢457 days\n\n‚Ä¢ 1 year and 3 months \n\nI wanted to make this post because I‚Äôve seen a lot of people who are making posts about being a couple weeks into their recovery, and I‚Äôd like to show them or y‚Äôall that they/ you can also rack up your clean time to where you‚Äôre at 3 months, then 5, then 8, then 12, then 15, etc. \n\nIt really feels great with each extra month you hit, and to be 110% honest‚Äî the more months you rack up, the less you even think about, ‚ÄúOh, it‚Äôs month 18‚Äù, for example. \n\nI really do not want to come off like, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm soooo cool because I have 15 months‚Äù, not at all. I just hope to show you guys that it‚Äôs possible to get clean and maintain that clean time. \n\nHell‚Äî 3 days ago I was chilling with my girl and long story short we went by the west side to cop some bud, just because my guy who lives by me wasn‚Äôt replying and we wanted to take a blunt cruise to the city, (I live about 18 miles outside of a large Midwest city that has a lake which meets Mich).\n\nAnyways, I told her to grab 3 grams of bud from her guy, and she runs up and gets it and comes back, and she pulls it out and we both were like, ‚ÄúWhat the fuck..???‚Äù ‚Äî Long story short it was Heroin. (She ran it back and I got my bud though, but still...) \n\nAnd besides that, I have another friend who gets Norcos prescribed but also buys about 170 10mg Norcos every week to sell and also keep some for herself. So when I chill with her they‚Äôre like always around, (üôÑ), which I have brought up to her. \n\nIn the beginning of my recovery I wasn‚Äôt around Norcos or Heroin just because I just kinda stayed to myself and just worked and stuff, but it‚Äôs just funny how now I don‚Äôt even entertain the idea of relapsing‚Äî it‚Äôs absolutely laughable. \n\nI don‚Äôt know y‚Äôall‚Äî I just feel like the dope game now isn‚Äôt what it used to be even 2 years ago. Like I said, the other day I drove by where I used to pick up‚Äî my girl and I literally parked *right where* we used to to grab from our other dude we‚Äôd grab from back then, and she ran up but grabbed from her newer dude. \n\nBut I don‚Äôt know, I just feel like sobriety from H is so much better than doing the absolute most just to feel numb for 2 hours‚Äî because that‚Äôs how it is now with the Fent-cut *everything*, unless you‚Äôre fuckin with straight Oxys or script opiates. But still, just not worth it for/ to me. \n\n\nI hope y‚Äôall stay safe, and if relapsing is something you‚Äôre considering doing‚Äî please just don‚Äôt, it‚Äôs not worth it, but more importantly, be safe. Do it with people around, even if they don‚Äôt know you use. You‚Äôd rather have them call 911 to revive you if you were to OD than for you to OD alone and pass away.  \n\n\n\nTLDR; The dope game just isn‚Äôt what it used to be. Give sobriety a try‚Äî if you really don‚Äôt like it, the drugs will always be there. Feb 12th will be 15 months of sobriety from Heroin and opiates for me. It‚Äôs worth it, and though lately I‚Äôve been struggling‚Äî it‚Äôs so much better than struggling in addiction. Thanks, y‚Äôall. üíñ",

    "title": "Experiencing the symptoms of PAWS is an opportunity to practice walking through pain without picking up a substance to change the negative feelings.",
    "selftext": "\n\nPost-Acute Withdrawal Syndome (PAWS)\n\n\nPAWS may be a condition with a cute acronym, but its symptoms are really ugly. Let‚Äôs set the scene. You‚Äôre a month or two or nine months  into recovery, feeling better and starting to learn how to live sober. Out of nowhere, you start feeling different. Nothing horrible, just a little off, so to speak.\n\nBut the next day, it gets worse. Social situations become difficult to navigate. The work environment seems extra stressful. Sleep is evasive at best, and you have trouble with cognitive tasks. You may also find yourself daydreaming about executing a fatal judo-chop to the guy who gave you a ‚Äúfunny look.‚Äù \n\n\nWelcome to post-acute withdrawal syndrome.\n\nRoughly 90% of those addicted to opiates long term, like heroin or prescription pain medication, experience this uncomfortable condition. It affects virtually everyone who gets sober from substance abuse at some point. And it might be the most underestimated cause relapse.\n\n Some common symptoms of PAWS include\n\n‚Ä¢ Dysphoria \n‚Ä¢ Mood swings or anhedonia\n‚Ä¢ Sleep disorders\n‚Ä¢ Anger\n‚Ä¢ Lethargy or chronic fatigue\n‚Ä¢ Depression\n‚Ä¢ Anxiety or panic\n‚Ä¢ Inability to concentrate\n\nWhile the above list is¬†formidable, most people do not experience all the symptoms on the list (or all of them at once). Also, the human body is strong and resilient; with continued abstinence, the recovering person can be confident that his or her body and mind are repairing the damage. The above problems will come and go, and the symptoms will decrease in strength and duration as the body continues to repair itself and heal.\n\nDysphoria \n\nThe opposite of euphoria. A fancy word to describe the feeling of basically want to jump out of your own skin. \n\nAnger / Irritability\n\nAs in deep unfounded resovoirs of endless raging anger for no reason at all. The kind of anger that rages subtly like a small flame that even the slightest unexpected  event outside of your control will set ablaze into a blistering inferno of \"fire and fury\" !\n\nDepression\n\nLike serious everyday is dark and gloomy when will I feel better -holy shit -wtf -depression.\n\nInsomnia\n\nInsomnia doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean you are experiencing post-acute withdrawal, but it is often a tell-tale sign. You may notice your sleep cycle disturbed. You may endure nights of extremely restless sleep. Vivid dreams, often involving the use of alcohol and drugs, may also occur during this time.\n\nIn severe cases, you may go days without sleep despite months of sobriety. Stressful situations often trigger these episodes.\n\nWhen I experienced bouts of PAWS, there were times where I had no sleep. This usually lasted one day, but sometimes it continued into the next day. There were also times where I‚Äôd have trouble going to sleep, and times where I‚Äôd wake up too early. I endured just about every form of insomnia possible. In almost every situation, stressful life circumstances brought about the sleeplessness.\n\nAnxiety\n\nAnxiety and insomnia seemed to be two sides of the same coin. The less I slept, the more anxious I was. The more I slept, the less anxious I was.\n\nWorry and fear clouded my mental climate in early sobriety. I think everyone, to some extent, deals with anxiety when they get sober. But I feel opiate addicts, in particular, battle the soul-wrenching tension more so than substance abusers of different varieties.\n\nEarly on, anxiety intruded on almost all circumstances. I felt like the Tin Man with no oil when I was in a room full of people I barely knew. \n\n\nHeightened levels of stress and/or increased sensitivity to stress\n\nStress was never something I‚Äôd handled well. My mind amplified situations that shouldn‚Äôt have been that big of a deal. First, I‚Äôd never developed ways to take care of myself. Second, my mind invented fairytale perspectives, specifically relating to social situations. Third, I never learned how to say ‚Äúno.‚Äù I often pushed myself to the breaking point, piling on responsibilities to an overwhelmed schedule.\n\n\nTrouble with cognition/thinking\n\nIt was equally disturbing when I realized how simple the answer was to certain problems. Sometimes, my job required me to do simple math. 15+18 presented a mental challenge only Texas Instruments could solve.\n\n\nTrouble with emotions (overreaction or little/no emotion)\n\n\nThere were also times where I felt incapable of producing a single emotion ‚Äì total emptiness. It went as far as me giving names to my emotions when they surfaced and feeling incredibly insightful that I had reached such a level of maturity.\n\nTrouble in social settings\n\nGranted, there wasn‚Äôt much social exercise occurring in the using of heroin and other drugs. My social skills were never that sharp anyway, and years of drug abuse really rounded this out.\n\n\nTHE BEST DEFENSES AGAINST PAWS\n\nMeditation\n\nI believe With some good direction, you can begin to calm your mind.\n\nRegular sleep schedule\n\nThis is fairly self-explanatory and really just entails consistent discipline. I feel like there are three critical elements in cultivation of healthy sleep habits.\n\nThe first element is diet. I can‚Äôt sleep when I‚Äôm hungry.\n\nThe second element is target time. Set a window of time, say 10pm to 11pm.\n\n\nSober friendships\n\nIt‚Äôs time to say goodbye to all those terrific people with whom you drank and did drugs. If you truly want to stay sober, you must shut the door on the ‚Äúold playmates.‚Äù \n\nSober friendships add a layer of accountability to your program and provide people with whom you can confide in times of need. You must lean on these people when PAWS cycles start. Talk to them about how you‚Äôre feeling. Ask for direction and support.\n\nExercise\n\nExercise helps your body heal faster and may shorten the amount of time spent experiencing post-acute withdrawal.\n\nEven something as simple as a 20 minute walk can do wonders for your mood.\n\nDiet\n\nIt‚Äôs a good idea to keep caffeine to a minimum. These days, I‚Äôm a one or two cup guy. \n\nSugar should be treated in like fashion. A candy bar here and there isn‚Äôt going to kill you.\n\nI‚Äôve found on days I keep my meals restricted to eggs, chicken, oatmeal, fruits and vegetables, I feel fantastic.¬† Like recovery, however, it doesn‚Äôt take much to throw me off the beam.\n\nRecovery \n\nHave a healthy, active relationship with your sponsor will shield you from a potential relapse due to PAWS. He or she is someone you can talk with confidentially and honestly. An authentic line of communication can go a long way in calming the unwelcome side effects of your body‚Äôs readjustment period.\n\nHealing is a slow process, but there are things the recovering addict can do to help. It‚Äôs good to remember to be very kind to your body, mind and spirit. Get plenty of rest, eat well, and exercise. \nTake time to make nutritious meals, exercise, cultivate a clean living space and fellowship with friends. By finding time to unwind, you will help decrease the severity and frequency of post acute withdrawal symptoms. Form friendships with others in recovery and with people who are trying to live healthy. Take every opportunity to have fun. Laughter is a great healer, and especially when things are frustrating, it helps to laugh at oneself; this is possible with the knowledge that things are going to get better.\n\nAbove all, do not go back to using. Experiencing the symptoms of PAWS is an opportunity to practice walking through pain without picking up a substance to change the negative feelings.\n\nOne feeling you can cultivate to combat despair and the temptation to use is gratitude. It is really hard to ingest a harmful poison when you‚Äôre full of gratitude. It‚Äôs possible to be grateful for each experience, even pain. Allowing oneself to experience pain without doing something to change the feeling engenders strength and growth.\n\nHow long will this last? There‚Äôs no one-size-fits-all answer to this question. You can expect to feel progressively better the longer you abstain from your substance(s), but there can be days that you‚Äôre feeling depressed or anxious for no apparent reason. Just remember that this is normal and that it will end.\n\n\n¬†¬†¬†",

    "title": "November 1st, 2018. The day everything changed.",
    "selftext": "I forgot to post anything on here a couple weeks ago but I just recently celebrated 1 year clean from Heroin! \n\nI‚Äôve always been a lurker and too anxious to post on here, huge panic disorder. But fuck it, I did it. I made it 1 year without putting a single opiate into my body and I‚Äôm proud of myself. \n\nI‚Äôll make this short but a year ago, on November 1st 2018 I got arrested on my multiple warrants, out of state so I knew I was getting extradited. Laying in my cell, puking all over myself cause I couldn‚Äôt get up to the toilet, having seizures from also kicking 15mg of Xanax a day as well at the same time. I got so bad that the Jail literally ended up taking me to the hospital because my body physically couldn‚Äôt handle detoxing off a ball a day Heroin habit and a huge benzo habit at the same time and the Doctor ended up literally writing for the Jail to require to give me Suboxone 3x daily in Jail, I was shocked. But it saved my life. I had no intention of quitting I just wanted the quickest way out of jail at the time. \n\nI‚Äôm going to sum this up because it‚Äôs a lengthy story but I ended up getting extradited back to WA state, facing 8 felonies. I luckily took the best deal I could and plead to 3 of them for 6 months ran concurrent to drop the rest, which were 36 months I was facing. I ended up in work release, got a job, and this is about 2 months clean now, still just trying to get through it so I can go back to my thing. \n\nBut something happened. I started getting happy. At the littlest things. Seeing my family (who is also HUGE in recovery, they run our local ALANO club) tell me they were proud of me. Clocking in at a job. Coming back and knowing I was gonna pass my UA everyday I left for work release and came back. I got happy. And I knew I was gonna die if I went back out. \n\nAfter 8 OD‚Äôs, 3 month hospital stays from sepsis while having Heroin brought to me at the hospital so I could shoot it into my pick line that went to my heart, I knew I would die. I don‚Äôt know how I even made it to be honest all I know is I‚Äôm grateful beyond measure. \nSo I finished my time, started getting into the program, which I‚Äôve been around my entire life because of my parents, got a sponsor who is now the biggest role model in my life today, and my best friend. Fast forward a year, today, I haven‚Äôt used since the moment I was arrested a year ago.\n\nI actively participate in my life with my family, who trusts me again? What? ITS CRAZY! I met the absolute love of my life (who‚Äôs a normie) so that‚Äôs been its own beautiful journey, we live in our own home together that I GET to pay the rest for each month, and We are expecting our first child, our daughter, in February. \n\nI was terrified to post this but that‚Äôs the whole process of becoming a better me, coming out of my comfort zone, not being afraid or judged for what I write or post. I FUCKING DID IT, And I‚Äôm proud. I‚Äôm blessed, but most of all I‚Äôm grateful. I went from puking on myself in a jail cell having seizures, thinking my life was over and I was ready to die, to waking up every morning, with the person I love most in this world next to me and our daughter in her tummy, not worrying about being sick, actively trying to better myself constantly. And I still have flaws, plenty of them. I think the biggest misconception when I got clean was the whole ‚Äúonce you get clean your life will be better‚Äù and I was confused why that wasn‚Äôt happening, why this magical sober fairy wasn‚Äôt making my life better. And that‚Äôs when I realized, nothing changes if nothing changes. Getting clean is the backbone, the foundation, but learning how to live again is it‚Äôs own completely separate thing. And I live again today. \n\nNovember 1st, 2018. The worst day of my life, but the day i will forever carry as the day that my life changed forever. This took me days to get the courage to post but I‚Äôm happy i out my anxiety aside and did it. Stories like these, they can truly help people. I‚Äôve read similar stories that gave me even just the thought of ‚Äúmaybe I should get clean?‚Äù So if this teaches 1,000 people or reaches none, that‚Äôs okay. I just wanted to share my condensed journey of my recovery. It is possible guys, we do recover.",

So depressed I killed the nerves in my bladder, having delusions that I was dead or with no soul. I was starving and living in my car, and the fentanyl could not even touch my tolerance. I was sitting in my car, razor blades scattered and rig in hand, debating shooting up fentanyl by myself for the first time.

Several incident reports, behavioral contracts, and a 5150, I put staff through hell, but they saw my potential, and how at risk I was, and so they did everything in their power to help me.\n\nI read Bill‚Äôs Story in the big book maybe three weeks in and everything just clicked. I poured my soul into my recovery, and now everything seems to be falling into place. I‚Äôm going to college this fall, I have a place to live at sober living, I have a growing sober network, and I‚Äôve even been promised a job at my rehab in the coming months doing art therapy groups, so long as I keep at my recovery.\n\nLearning to love myself has been a bumpy road, but I‚Äôm making progress. \n\nTo anyone reading this who is still struggling, healing IS possible. And it‚Äôs so so worth it. And that‚Äôs coming from me, someone who has been in and out of institutions since I was 15, someone who did not have a will to live for years, someone who had no hopes for the future, someone who‚Äôs own mother suggested assisted suicide because nobody could see a way for me to get better. You guys, its possible.",

I deleted their numbers and then smashed my phone then went and bought a new one and changed my number. \n\nIf I could get through it you can too. I wasn't even able to stay clean longer than 30 hours a few months back. The withdrawal was SO bad. Probably the worst kick I've ever had in my 10 years of opiate addiction.\n\nI still am dealing with low energy and random spells of chills and headaches. I was slamming a half gram a day, sometimes a whole gram, before I stopped. I had nightmares and woke other people up several times a week from screaming in my sleep. Pure terror. Had super weird dreams for a whole month. I had acute withdrawal symptoms for 22 days! It felt like it was never going to end. I couldn't eat and my digestion was stopped so when I did finally get an appetite, it just hurt to have food going through my system. Crapped blood for a few days and had unbelievable headaches. One of the worst things was the extreme photophobia (Sensitivity to light). I couldn't open my eyes at all when I went outside. My eyes felt sore and they would swell up and start watering, lasted for a few weeks!\n\nNow, I have gained 30lbs and started lifting weights again. Looking beefy and I'm loving it. This is honestly something only God could have helped me with. I have been struggling for 10 years to get clean. Now my relationships are being restored. My family wants me around, I'm back with my wife. We just celebrated our 5 year anniversary. \n\nJust wanted to let you all know it is possible! If you can do it on your own more power to you, but I couldn't. I needed divine intervention. God will come to the rescue if you cry out to Him. Even if you don't know what God is.

I would be just now falling asleep from a night of celebration and congratulations to a year clean and sober, but instead I lie here shaking like a fish out of water, unable to keep my body at a stable temperature, unable to hold still for 30 seconds, unable to sleep except right after vomiting, just to wake up with every inch on my body hurting to limp to the bathroom and do it all again. Grown men are not supposed to shit themselves for any reason and yet I do it everytime I vomit. Don't have the energy to bathe so I lay in the shower as the water does the work I cannot. Did this happen overnight? Absolutely not. It all started as a troubled and naive 16 year old fresh into high school, smoked weed a few times and was absolutely in love with it, why? I'm a bi polar schizophrenk and for me the pot did what the meds couldn't quite do. No, due to my parents intellect they never allowed the doctors to provide me anything highly addictive, but I find xanax on my own. I was introduced to the little pill of pain at 16 years old in the lunch room of my high school, a boy had stolen his mothers prescription after his older brother hyped up the drug. For me, it lived up to all the hype. A drug to wipe my anxiety and not give a fuck who you are or what j think you're thinking? Sign me up for good. That was the beginning. After 2 years of heavy addiction starting at 17 I cannot remember a single moment of my junior or senior year of high school. I then had my wisdom teeth surgery and was introduced to opiates which was even more of a BINGO moment for me, the euphoria and energy I would receive in the beginning was a feeling of complete nirvana. I began with perc 30s and eventually progressed to fentanyl after dealing dog food for quite some time. Introduced as a money maker I fell in love ASAP and ran with it....until I found myself at 21 living under a bridge with nothing to my name but the clothes I had on and a half gram of fentanyl, at that moment I did all.i had left and went to rehab. On the 28th of February I should've celebrated 1 year clean, instead, I relapsed on valentines day of 2020 and I now sit here March 3rd after a heart attack yesterday morning from not taking any other medications of mine after being on them for 10 years besides 330mg of oxycodone. I am now back at home and seeking detox and treatment and believe I have found a bed come Thursday. I had been on suboxone and decided to get off it early and even after suffering through those excruciating withdrawals the opiates sang to me like the sirens in Greek mythology and I couldnt turn away\n I do not know why I am posting this maybe I just needed to talk to myself or what but my mind is a jumbled mess so I will not be proof reading any of this I just need whoever is going through the same thing that as long as your heart is beating the fight ain't over yet",

My pain was still there, there was PAWS, and I just wanted to feel better. I relapsed on my meds quickly for the pain, but I stopped the day after. I remembered what they didn't tell me in detox- that you need to recondition your brain to start creating and pumping out dopamine, serotonin, etc. The only thing that has allowed me to do this is...... \n\nWalking. Just walking a lot with increasing intensity til I can jog. Nothing felt bad when I was walking. My body still feels weak since my detox was recent, but emotionally, I'm not bad off lately at all. Just because I've been walking so much. Multiple times a day. If you have a dog, even better. \n\nYesterday, I didn't go outside at all and played video games as a rest day for my legs. My pain was more tolerable, no cravings. I felt ok. Anytime you start feeling bad, go on a long walk (listen to some music too) and work into jogging once your legs and cardio can handle it comfortably. When you're done, do something that brings you contentment like a hobby. This has helped me so much in what should be a more depressing time.

We‚Äôve struggled with the same demons and have been graced by the same angels that have helped us make it this far. You are not alone, even when the deafening silence is about to drive you mad, and it feels like the walls are closing in on you. You are not alone.\n\nWhen I was 13 going on 14, I took my first Lortab. I remember the experience better than my own high school graduation. I remember thinking that I would never want to feel anything else except that feeling, and I was okay with that. I had a physically abusive father who struggled with substance abuse issues and alcoholism. When he drank he would black out and go into a blind rage. A few times my mom had to ask her best friend to take us to the Motel 6 in the next town over, so he could ride his bender out. We‚Äôd come home to a demolished house that we‚Äôd have to clean up, while my mother cried and started packing our stuff, only to be fooled by promises that he wouldn‚Äôt hit us again. I remember another time that I came home from school and my mom and a different friend were talking about how my dad had been drinking that day, and I was hit with such a powerful anxiety attack that I barely made it to the kitchen‚Äôs trash can before I threw my guts up in fear. Fear of being hit, of him hurting my mom or my sisters and brother. The day I took that first Lortab, I remember thinking, ‚ÄúYou never have to feel that fear again.‚Äù\n\nI was wrong.\n\nI struggled with addiction for the next 17 years. I missed school trips because I was detoxing and couldn‚Äôt get out of bed. I forged doctors notes because I didn‚Äôt have a fix and couldn‚Äôt handle the anxiety of going to school. I had unnecessary surgeries just to get more pills and would beg the doctor to give me just one extra refill, which he reluctantly did. Even though I became the high school yearbook editor and had a good group of friends, I was expelled my first semester of my senior year from missing too much school because I was detoxing and couldn‚Äôt get out of bed. By the grace of God and taking night classes at the local Ivy Tech, I graduated on time. Do you think I learned my lesson?\n\nI enrolled in college, only to flunk out after my first semester when I found a pill mill to supply me with a ridiculous number of Lortabs and Xanax. I thought I was the shit back then. When I blew through my 210-pill script of 7.5‚Äôs and resorted to stealing from my employer I'd go to a dealer to buy IR morphine 15's at $10 a pop. The price wasn‚Äôt what mattered to me, only that I found a way to get them. When my employer got wise and the cops came, my grandpa bailed me out and gave me a stern lecture on our way to my parent‚Äôs house. I completed a year‚Äôs worth of unsupervised probation and was rewarded with a felony for my ‚Äúhard work‚Äù. I would be arrested again when I got pulled over and the police found 10 Norco‚Äôs I thought I could get away with by hiding in my right shoe. I spent the next three days detoxing in the county jail before my great aunt reluctantly agreed to give my best friend money to bail me out because my parents didn‚Äôt have the money. Luckily, my public defender got the charges dismissed for an unlawful search.\n\nFast forward a couple more years of the using and detoxing cycle. My mother had been in the hospital for chest pains, but since she was a volunteer EMT without health insurance, and my dad wouldn‚Äôt work long enough to obtain any, the hospital decided to skip some tests they‚Äôd deemed ‚Äúunnecessary‚Äù. 10 days later I went to see if she wanted any coffee and see if I could sneak one of her Roxy 30‚Äôs she had for chronic pain resulting in a neck surgery for a pinched nerve and titanium vertebra replacement that actually gave her legitimate pain. Who took pills for actual pain? I just wanted one for that nasty first-thing-in-the-morning dope sickness. She was sitting Indian-styled in bed but slouched over. It was an unnatural looking position, but I thought maybe she was trying to be funny or something. I walked up to her and went to shake her, and she was cold. I lifted her up and her jaw was slack, and her eyes were rolled up in the back of her head.\n\n‚ÄúMom?‚Äù\n\nNo Response.\n\nMore urgently, ‚ÄúMom?!‚Äù\n\nNothing.\n\n‚ÄúMA!‚Äù\n\nI heard footfalls coming down the hall. *How could my dad wake up beside her and not notice this?* I thought perversely. ‚ÄúDAD!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWHAT?‚Äù he screams as he busted through the door, obviously more worried I found his stash instead of something actually being wrong.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Ma! She‚Äôs not breathing! Oh, my god!‚Äù I sobbed.\n\nHe moved me out of the way and carried her to the living room, lying her in front of my upright piano my brother bought for me at a local auction for $50. I grabbed my phone and called 911.\n\n‚Äú911, what‚Äôs your emergency?‚Äù a woman asked through what sounded like radio static.\n\n‚ÄúMy mom. She isn‚Äôt breathing! She‚Äôs cold!‚Äù I cried into my mint green LG Chocolate phone.\n\n‚ÄúOkay, honey, I need you to calm down. Help is on the way. What is your address?‚Äù she asks calmly. *How the fuck can she be so calm?* I remember thinking.\n\nAfter I manage to recite my address, she asks, ‚ÄúDo you know how to administer CPR?‚Äù\n\nFuck. My mom was the EMT, not me. I was just her queer, loser-ass pill junkie son. ‚ÄúI think so.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôll help you. Just follow my instructions, ‚Äòkay?‚Äù she says with more determination I‚Äôd ever heard in my life.\n\nMy dad managed to fish her top denture out of her mouth, causing my big brother to retch. He always had a weak stomach, even though he could shoot and skin a deer. Realization was setting in on my dad‚Äôs face. A man I‚Äôd feared for most of my life was scared shitless, and it fucking terrified me. I push him aside and put the dispatcher on speakerphone. I follow her instructions and adjusted her head in the correct position. A clear, frothy substance oozed from her mouth, but I didn‚Äôt give a fuck. I was under the delusion I could resurrect the woman who gave me life.\n\nI put my mouth on hers as I plugged her nose. I breathed, but her lungs refused the air. I tried pumping her chest anyway. Another breath. Nothing. I heard sirens drawing near, and thanked God help was coming. I continued the CPR until my brother let the EMT‚Äôs in.\n\n‚ÄúShe‚Äôs right here!‚Äù I said hopefully, as I wiped my mouth of the frothy substance. The sound of their shoes was loud on our hardwood floor as they carry their medic bags in. The same kind of bag my mom used to save lives on her many middle-of-the-night ambulance runs.\n\nThey connected some electrodes to her and checked her vitals. The paramedics, a man and a woman, gave each other a knowing look. The man looks at me and says, ‚ÄúWe need to get her in the ambulance, now.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù I replied matter-of-factly. That‚Äôs why I called them. They had a miracle in the back of that thing, I just knew it!\n\n‚ÄúYou can follow us to the hospital.‚Äù the woman says kindly, but with a weak smile.\n\nI got in my mom‚Äôs car with my dad and brother, choosing to remain hopeful, completely forgetting about the withdrawals. The biochemical reaction of fear and shock was winning out on this one. We followed the ambulance nearly 15 miles to the hospital, but they didn‚Äôt run their lights or sirens.\n\n‚ÄúWhat are they doing?‚Äù I demanded furiously at my dad and brother. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt these assholes know this is a goddamn emergency?‚Äù\n\nMy dad and brother exchanged a look but said nothing. I slammed myself back down into the backseat angrily. I was going to tell Ma about how unprofessional her medics were. She‚Äôd know who to talk to. When we pulled into the ER parking lot, I ran into the hospital whose cafeteria I worked at all through high school. I knew my way around and exactly where to go.\n\nWe made it to the front desk and I give them my mother‚Äôs name. They don‚Äôt open the side door by the elevator to let us through, though. The lead us to the door by the triage room. The room reserved for the worst of news. *Eh, maybe the door is broken and that was the only way through*, I told myself.\n\nThe lighting was dim, and the room smelled so sterile that I wanted to puke. A moment later, an older gentleman in a white lab coat, a doctor I gathered, came in with a clipboard. My dad and brother exchanged another look. *The doctor isn‚Äôt smiling, which is strange since he surely has good news*, I thought manically.\n\n‚ÄúHow is she doctor? Is she awake? Can we talk to her now?‚Äù I asked confidently. If I willed it to be, It would be.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, but she‚Äôs gone,‚Äù he said sincerely.\n\nThe room spun around me and the air took on a life of its own. The ground wasn‚Äôt moving, but it felt like it was crumbling beneath my feet. In the back of my mind, I knew it was coming, but my delusions were the only thing that had kept me sane and calm during the crisis. But his words were like an incantation that invoked a carefully buried madness inside me. I hear a blood curdling scream, and a moment later, I realize it‚Äôs my own. My brother caught me as I fell towards the ground, and I scream again. ‚ÄúNOOOOO!‚Äù\n\nThe doctor winced and told my dad we could see her when we were ready. A part of my soul died at that very moment, and it wasn‚Äôt going gently. My brother wrapped his arms around me and says, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúShe‚Äôs dead, she‚Äôs dead, she‚Äôs dead.‚Äù I sobbed incoherently. My stomach twisted in knots and I couldn‚Äôt breathe.\n\nMy dad said nothing and began to follow the doctor out of the room. My brother lifted me to my feet and helped me out of the door. I must have looked a sight. Unconsciously detoxing, no shower, and tears falling from eyes that were now lifeless from loss and grief. I felt like a zombie. I walked down the hallway in a daze to see my mother for the last time before I‚Äôd see her in her casket. She looked peaceful lying on the ER bed, with a sheet carefully placed up to her neck, the one that had caused her so much pain. My dad cried, and it is one of the only times I can count on one hand that I‚Äôd seen him do that. I had to sign the paperwork in a numb haze that felt like I was in an alternate reality. Like the Twilight Zone or something.\n\nMy sisters were both living out of state at the time, and I tried to get them to answer the phone, but I forgot about the time zone differences. No answers. I call my best friend and numbly tell him. He breaks down in tears over the phone. She was like a second mom to him, and he loved her too. Everyone loved her. My oldest sister finally answered, and I deliver the news and hang up. I couldn‚Äôt console her. I couldn‚Äôt even console myself. Luckily, my best friend broke the news to my other sister, so I didn‚Äôt have to. For everyone else, I made a straightforward PSA-like post on Facebook. I couldn‚Äôt keep saying the words.\n\nThe week leading up to the funeral, and the weeks following it were a blur. I planned most of the funeral, and God bless my aunt who put it on her credit cards. I guess she felt she could do that much for her late sister. The day of the funeral, I managed to stay sober enough to tell my mother goodbye and watch as my aunt, cousin, and the rest of her fellow volunteer EMT‚Äôs gave her that one final call over the radio. It was like a knife pierced my heart. I refused to leave the cemetery until the groundskeepers lowered her casket into the ground. I wanted the closure and finality of that morbid symbolism. Once she was lowered into the ground, my sister that I didn‚Äôt have to tell the news to grabbed my arm and said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs over. She‚Äôs home now. We need to go.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI can‚Äôt leave her. She is alone.‚Äù I cried.\n\n‚ÄúNo, bub, she isn‚Äôt. She never has to be alone again where she is.‚Äù she murmured as she gently pulled my arm.\n\nI took one final look at her casket as tears fell and whispered, ‚ÄúGoodbye, Ma. I love you.‚Äù\n\nI skipped the wake and snorted some of her Roxy‚Äôs I found after we got home from the hospital. My dad wanted to fight me over them, but any fear I had of him died with my mother. I nearly kicked his ass and he conceded. They were *hers*, and he wasn‚Äôt getting them. He woke up next to her and didn‚Äôt know she was dead. He didn‚Äôt deserve anything that was hers. That week family had come from all over, and I was so high at a restaurant, I passed out in my plate. My sister woke me up and walked me to the car. Everyone forgave me at that time, given the circumstances.\n\nI stayed in a constant state of opiate-induced sedation, and to this day do not know how I didn‚Äôt overdose during that dark time. This went on for a few months until the reality that she wasn‚Äôt coming back set in. My family watched me closely, afraid that I was going to kill myself in my grief. Ironically, the thought never crossed my mind. I had to live for the both of us now. Days and weeks blurred until I finally realized that I couldn‚Äôt be there anymore, because every time I looked at something, all I saw was that she wasn‚Äôt there. The pills didn‚Äôt help the pain though. Not the real pain I was feeling. No matter how much I took, which was substantial, it did nothing for my grief. And that was before the coroner called and said she died of congestive heart failure brought on by 98% blockage in her arteries and an accidental overdose of her Roxy‚Äôs. I convinced myself that the coroner was doing that to protect the hospital from malpractice because they skipped those tests. My oldest sister believes my mom knew she was dying and chose to go gently in her sleep.\n\nTo this day, I still don‚Äôt know what to believe, but I don‚Äôt think that really matters, does it? It doesn‚Äôt change the outcome.\n\nMy mom‚Äôs sister bought me a bus ticket to my sister‚Äôs down south, afraid that if I stayed I wouldn‚Äôt make it through Christmas. During this time, I made sure to get to the pill-mill so I‚Äôd have my one last hurrah before cleaning my act up. It took a ton of mental preparation, but I wanted to do it for me, and for my mom.\n\nThe detox was brutal. It was the most brutal detox I‚Äôd ever had, and the first one I‚Äôd completed in my life. Even after the acute withdrawals were over, I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable in my own skin for a month. I was a pro though, and the pill‚Äôs hooks were deep. I made a 500-mile trip back home to get another script of Lortabs while staying with my aunt for a month. She finally had enough of me and got me a train ticket back to my sister‚Äôs. Luckily, this time I stayed for five years. The doctor that had supplied me for so long got busted, and lost his license, so even if I wanted to, I couldn‚Äôt get anything. I had no reason to go back. I detoxed again, staying clean for three months that time.\n\nI got a job working with my brother-in-law. Of course, there were people in there selling pills to make extra money, and I was making good enough money to buy. I learned to manage to take just enough to curb the cravings without getting dependent. That was, until I got a raise. When I inevitably got fired three years to the day after I got hired, I lucked out and got unemployment. I met a guy through a mutual friend whose girlfriend was stealing pills during her rounds at one of the local nursing homes. When my unemployment and 401k ran out, I got a job at a local gas station. My sister gave birth to my niece, and I fell in love. That tiny baby brought me more happiness than a pill ever could, so I stayed clean for a while. That didn‚Äôt last long because I stole one of my coworkers Norcos out of her purse and got arrested. My sister bailed me out, using my car title and a bail bondsman.\n\n‚ÄúYou do realize every problem in your life has been caused by pills don‚Äôt you?‚Äù she said to me after bailing me out.\n\n‚ÄúI know,‚Äù I said to acknowledge her grievance, and to get her off my back. We rode in silence for the rest of the way.\n\nI got another job, took a plea deal and got a deferral if I completed six months of supervised probation. The kind you had to pass drug tests for. In the meantime, my dealer‚Äôs girlfriend introduced me to my boyfriend, who is a silly southern man with a bad back but hates taking meds. He‚Äôs never even smoked weed. His mom was a Pentecostal pastor, you know, the kind that speaks in tongues and falls out in church? So, he had a clean upbringing and didn‚Äôt believe in taking narcotics himself. He was only getting Tylenol 4‚Äôs, but I didn‚Äôt know that for a few months after we started dating. He had two big bottles saved up from not using them, and I was in heaven, until I took them all. At first, he started to let me have some here and there, and when I moved in, I had free access. The poor guy loves me so much that he would let me get away with murder, let alone taking the pills he didn‚Äôt use. To be fair, I do love him and was upfront about my addiction and legal situation when we started dating, but he didn‚Äôt care. He loves me even with my flaws.\n\nI eventually talked him into telling his nurse practitioner that the meds weren‚Äôt working, and she started giving him the good stuff. Roxy‚Äôs, Percocet, even Xanax bars, even though I wasn‚Äôt a big benzo taker unless I was detoxing. I was taking all his meds and then carefully making sure I didn‚Äôt have anything in my system for my probation meetings. Honestly, having to quit smoking weed was harder emotionally than the pills. I was getting so tired of my life at this point. After a while, she made him start going to a pain clinic, and he was getting extended release morphine and Percocet. I‚Äôd take them, but I developed a deep depression because I couldn‚Äôt find a job and started to see my life for what it was.\n\nA fucking joke.\n\nThe following Thanksgiving, we traveled to my grandmother‚Äôs house. Everyone was there, including my dad, who was now living with my mom‚Äôs best friend who used to get us hotel rooms when he would get wasted. It triggered something in me, because I had been doing well, but we had his scripts because I couldn‚Äôt sell them before the holidays, so naturally, I got wrecked and embarrassed myself, made my grandmother cry, and made my whole family turn their backs on me at once. When we left her house, I knew I‚Äôd really done it that time. My sister said I wouldn‚Äôt see my niece until I got it together, and kept it together, and my heart shattered. She was like a daughter to me. I babysat her day in and day out while she went to nursing school and we had bonded. I knew I never wanted kids. Who would want to pass down addiction to someone? Plus, hello, gay! I live vicariously through my siblings in that aspect.\n\nSo, the next three months, I didn‚Äôt handle the pills, I didn‚Äôt want to know about them until it was time to make some money. This worked well. I stayed clean. Tired of our living situation, we moved back to my hometown. I couldn‚Äôt find a real job, and my online freelance writing wasn‚Äôt enough. My best friend was ecstatic when I accepted his offer to move into his house. I got a job offer and life was really good. I had a steady income, we had some money and eventually got a place of our own. After the pain clinic got shut down, the monthly trips stopped, and I became stressed and started researching online about ‚Äúat home opiates‚Äù. I discovered poppy seed tea. I lost the next year and a half, our apartment, and stability to this drink. I did gain a shit ton of weight. It was perfect at first. Half a pitcher satisfied me for a whole day, and I would save the rest for the next. By the end of the year, I would be drinking nearly two gallons a day and shoplifting Bob‚Äôs Red Mill Poppy Seeds from any store that had them. My sister ended up getting a nursing job here and we got a place together, but I was still struggling. My health was suffering, physically and mentally, and I saw my dad having a nose bleed one day. Turns out his years of substance abuse were catching up to him. He is dealing with liver failure, congestive heart failure, and diabetes to name a few. It scared me straight. The weight gain, 17 years of on-again-off-again drug abuse, and physical health, in general, has probably damaged my body and liver already. I tapered down and prayed. Prayed harder than I ever had in my life for any kind of help.\n\nI actually wanted it this time. Truly wanted lasting sobriety.\n\nLuckily, the taper worked, and I experience minimal physical withdrawal symptoms, even though poppy seed tea had given me insanely rough ones before. The post-acute withdrawal symptoms were hard at first, too. Luckily, I live in an area where the DEA shut down all the ‚Äúcool‚Äù doctors and whispering ‚Äúopiates‚Äù will get you the evil eye. If you want anything, you have to go to the methadone clinic, which isn‚Äôt even a temptation for me. Hell, I could order poppy seeds online or go to the store and get them easily, even if I had to drive two hours. But I don‚Äôt want to. Not even tempted, and I‚Äôve wanted to use. I just chose the better option.\n\nYou may be asking, ‚ÄúWhat is the point of this epic confession of relapse and deviancy?‚Äù\n\nI‚Äôll tell you. As I said, I am just like you. No better, no worse. I found this Reddit group, and I have been so grateful for advice, and the hope I find here every day. I‚Äôm almost two weeks clean, and even through the horrible post-acute withdrawal symptoms like anxiety, cravings, and intermittent crippling depression, hope shines through. Looking back and taking stock of my shortcomings has been truly cathartic. I‚Äôve forgiven my dad for the hell he put me through, not for him, but for me and my own recovery. I‚Äôve accepted my mother‚Äôs death at the young age of 50. Most importantly, I‚Äôve forgiven myself for my long list of indiscretions and accept that I am in control of my own recovery, as long as I choose to be an active participant in it. Hell, I‚Äôve even looked into NA meetings and plan on going to one this week. I‚Äôd start jogging if it ever quits snowing! By the way, the weight is falling off from the massive amounts of poppy seed tea I was drinking. I already feel so much better and can see my feet when I look down!\n\nIt does not matter how many times you relapse, or the bad decisions you‚Äôve made. What matters is the future, and your perspective on things. I am not perfect, and don‚Äôt expect to be. I am an addict. It is literally in my DNA. That doesn‚Äôt mean I have to give into it. One thing I really enjoy is that I feel human again. I‚Äôm not uncomfortably numb and living in a cycle of being high and detoxing, worrying about finding a fix. Even with the bad stuff like anxiety, depression, and cravings, which will be gone before I know it, I feel alive again. I genuinely laugh at movies. I cried watching a music video the other day. Hell, I cried three times while writing this. Like, ugly Kim Kardashian cried. It feels amazing. I feel amazing. I‚Äôve never felt this way before when getting clean. Something tells me that if I work at it, this time it will stick. I‚Äôve talked to my boyfriend and sister who have agreed to do everything they can to support my recovery, whether it be cutting me slack when I feel like they‚Äôre riding my ass, or just giving words of encouragement. Honesty with the people in your life is key, and you can‚Äôt worry about some of the consequences. They want you to recover as much as you do, if not more. Secrets will eat you up inside and cause relapse. I know there is a good chance this won‚Äôt work statistically, because it is the nature of the disease, but it can if I choose to make it work.\n\nI spent a long time trying to fill a void with opiates, a void only time, love, wisdom, faith and a dash of bravery can heal. I‚Äôve realized that I don‚Äôt need the opiates to be happy, and I don‚Äôt want them. I‚Äôve had everything I‚Äôve needed all along, but I just couldn‚Äôt see it past the cycle I was stuck in. I want to feel everything this life has to offer. The good and the bad. I want to be as extraordinarily sober as possible, so I can watch my nieces and nephews grow up and graduate. I want to cry like a big ol‚Äô queen at their graduations and weddings, and nearly have a heart attack when they convince me to let them drive when they get their permits and almost run a red light. After all these years of stupidity, I want to dance in the rain or enjoy the sun on my face without worrying where I can get another fix. I want all this life has to offer because when I‚Äôm gone, I want to be remembered as a kind, loving, kickass survivor. Not an addict lost to tragedy.\n\nThe way I see it, you have two options: letting your addiction own you, or you can own your addiction. I don‚Äôt know about you, but I‚Äôm going with the latter. If I own it, I take some of its power away. Ironically enough, it is kind of like when I came out of the closet.\n\nAfter everything I‚Äôve been through, the loss, the heartache, the pain I‚Äôve felt and the pain I‚Äôve caused others, I want to live this life as fully as I can. It isn‚Äôt going to be easy, and there will be days that feel impossible. I accept this. Even on my worst days, I know there will be tomorrow, and another chance to be a bad ass who knows their limits and knows how to cope with them. When someone makes me mad, I‚Äôll forgive them and turn away. When I argue with my boyfriend over something petty, I‚Äôll tell him I still love him and listen to music until the urge to self-medicate passes. When I get a job and have a bad day at work, I‚Äôll remember that I‚Äôm almost finished with my first book and I have the chance to really do something with my life as long as I don‚Äôt relapse. When my sister gets on my last nerve because she thinks it is my turn to do the dishes, when it‚Äôs really her husband‚Äôs, I‚Äôll laugh and do them anyway, because it isn‚Äôt worth fighting over. The real fight is internal, and if I can have peace from within, everything else will fall in place. Sweating the small stuff isn‚Äôt worth falling back into my old ways.\n\nAfter all, I‚Äôm too blessed to be broken. I‚Äôve made it this far.\n\nStay strong. If I can do it, so can you.\n\nAnother Recovering Addict\n\nQuit Date: 2-8-19",

It started when i broke my neck c-4-c7 fusion surgery and was prescribed them, like anyone i took them as told. I dealt with a vigorous rehab trying to maintain living with a broken neck. I did pretty good with them for while  never really over took them, then in 2019 my parents got very sick and i was basically the main caregiver, during that period with all the stress and craziness involved with dealing with a 2 aging parents i really started to go in on the opioids just to feel calmer.  Both my parents died a year apart 2021 then 2022. For the last 2 years i have really depended on opioids (oxys) to make me feel normal. i have spent countless amount of money to buy them off people and im so sick of playing this game going as far sometime to tell my wife i had to pay a bill only to spend all that money on buying enough oxys to get me through a weekend. My family is unaware of this problem ive been having Ive been good at putting that mask on showing everyone im normal. But i think this is it  i really feel like ive hit rock bottom just angry at myself for letting it get this far.  Im on day 4 of no oxys and i don't fell great but these posts have really given me the motivation to keep going,",

I been working six 12hr shifts in a row to keep my mind busy so I won‚Äôt sit around thinking about doing pills. I got my first check since I been clean and it feels great having all this money and not blowing 800 a week in pills . I fought through and I‚Äôm doing better . Let this be motivation.

I would have given almost anything to stop being that sick, but I didn't. I let myself be that sick even though I didn't think I would ever feel better, I stuck it out. I genuinely didn't think I was going to be able to at the time, I promise. If you're there right now you're not alone. We all were positive that it was impossible, but I've made it here and others have made it longer. You're not unique, that's not an excuse, everyone that's been through there has been there and they made it and so can you. \n\nWithin a month my life was getting better. I relied on a couple good friends that were GOOD influences, people that I neglected for years when my priorities were fucked, and I was lucky that they were there for me. \nI suddenly had too much time on my hands and unneeded distractions from how shitty I felt and how bad I wanted some shit to make me feel better. So I dove into my passion projects that I had pushed to the side for shitty years. \nI hustled hard because I needed a new life to immerse myself in. Find something you genuinely love and bury yourself in it. Make it your new purpose in life, and you'll do fine. \nI learned in getting clean that my drug use for years was self medicating. I think a lot of us addicts or just drug users in general are the kind of people that need more out life. We need excitement and adventure and we need challenges. When we're confused or stuck in life the drugs are an easy way to find excitement and adventure every day. Each day is another challenge; make some money, buy some shit, and feel the reward. But it's so fuckin fake and hollow. \nWe're the kind of people that can do really awesome things. We're the go-getters and hustlers and dreamers and people with aspirations. We got off track for a little while, wasted some time and fucked our lives up bad. But we're the kind of people that can rebuild and conquer and take all the lessons we've learned from the wild shit lives we've lived and bring those experiences into some really productive outlets of our abilities. \n\nYou just gotta find something you love more than heroin or pills. You've been addicted to dope and you know how hard you'll go to get something you love that much, and how far you'll go to get it even though you also hate it. \nFind something that you'll work hard at on the days you hate it, that day in and day out you'll chase down and score. Cuz now that you're getting rid of this huge succubus that's taken over your life for so long, there's a lot of room for new life. Fill all that empty space with meaning, whatever that meaning may be, and you'll quickly stop feeling like something it missing. \n\nYou'll be good. You'll be fucking great. Just keep going. \n",

It never really felt like the right choice each time I thought about it because believe me, I have thought about it. This is the longest amount of sober time I‚Äôve had since I was 17 (surprise I‚Äôve never said that part before). I didn‚Äôt necessarily choose to stop using this time, but in the end I knew I had to. Mostly for my well being but also because the other options were scarier than stopping. Things were getting too dark too fast for me to handle at that point anyway. Looking back now I am grateful that I got up and pushed on every day no matter what. Some days will always be harder than others and that‚Äôs okay. No part of this is easy. Some days I still wish I was using just so I didn‚Äôt have to feel what I was feeling or deal with stupid day-to-day stressors. The cravings and urges to use opiates are still there, but I‚Äôm (finally) starting to learn how to properly cope with the thoughts and feelings I have regarding relapse or other self sabotaging things. I know I can turn to my supports who have been here since the beginning (I still don‚Äôt know how guys deal with me). I have found hobbies to fill the void that I always felt within me like caring for my plants and buying new plants and reading and music (ily Taylor Swift), and so many other things that used to not bring me joy because I was too focused on getting high.

This time I choose to be clean, I checked into a 5 day detox with suboxone taper, they asked me if i wanted to go to their residential program, and I said yes. Turns out to be the best decision I have ever made. I know it is not always the same for everyone but The 90 days I spent in rehab were the most productive days I have ever spent fixing the problems of my life. My therapist was the most amazing person, and helped me progress more then I could ever have wanted. Since Feb 5th I've started making music full time, I've mended relationships, fixed wrongs, and became a generally overall better person, husband, and dad. If you are ever on the fence about going to a program, just go for it. Everyone there is in the same place as you mentally, the staff at my facility was mostly recovering addicts themselves from the technicians to the licensed therapists. What helped me the most to decide to stay was that I didn't have much to loose and everything to gain, and in the back of my head I always thought that even if I hate it, Drugs aren't going to disappear so whats 90 days. Well turns out 90 days was the start of a beautiful thing. Im proud of every single day, and I would not trade them for the world. So you the person on the fence unsure of the future, DO IT, take a chance, give it a shot, worst case you spent 90 days learning lessons for the time you are sure you want to stop.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-KH",

    "selftext": "Think about the first time you tried opiates. It was probably the most innocent thing. Maybe you had a surgery and wanted to see how it felt or just liked how it felt. You get that warm and fuzzy feeling like nothing could be better. \n\nNext thing you know you're asking a friend who sells you a couple. You take them on and off because it feels good. You probably forgot about your childhood trauma or the anxiety and depression you used to have. All you know is that this pill is making everything so much better. You start spending more money and getting them more often.\n\nNow people might be warning you that you're going down a bad path. You don't believe them because you have it all under control. People start saying things, like \"this shit doesn't discriminate, be careful\". Oh but you have it all under control, addiction could never happen to me. I have a good life, good job, the perfect fiance, nah that would never happen.\n\nFast forward maybe a year, now you're taking triple of what you started with. It was on and off but you accidentally went on a binge. Maybe things have been tough at work or in your personal life. So this binge lasts maybe 4 days. You get minor withdrawals but it's no big deal right? Now you know that you can go this many days without feeling terrible. So then you push it a little further and instead of 4 days now it's a week and a half maybe two.\n\nAt this point, you feel like absolute dog shit. You go back to the plug and get some Suboxone or subutex. You start taking it for the withdrawals. Soon you find yourself dependent on the subs. You're taking them every day and at a pretty high dose because you still want to feel relaxed.\n\nDays turn to weeks, weeks turns to months, and before you know it you've been taking Suboxone for a year. Of course inbetween you're dabbling with the oxy or opiate of choice.\n\nA year on Suboxone now and all those childhood traumas, the anxiety, the depression, it's all coming to light. You've lost motivation in anything and everything. You don't enjoy the things you used to. You're sitting back watching life pass you by thinking you have no purpose in life.\n\nOne day, you get sick of feeling like you're wasting your life. So you decide to stop taking Suboxone, however, you have no idea what you're doing or how to do it. You just know that you need to stop so you quit cold turkey.\n\nEach day that goes by you feel worse and worse. You keep telling yourself that tomorrow will be better. Eventually you've gone a few weeks and tomorrow hasn't came. You've tried anything and everything to help with withdrawals.\n\nThat's when it really hits you... Why did I do this to myself. Why did I let myself get to this point. HOW did I get to this point?! This could NEVER happen to me!! \n\nBut yet you're sitting there sick... Your new truck has been reposessed...You're a month behind on your mortgage.. and all you can do is sit there praying you feel better tomorrow... When will tomorrow come?\n\nPlease, if anyone is on here reading this, please, I'm literally begging you to think twice before you dive into this terrible world of opiates. It's not worth all that is to follow. Go smoke weed or something if you want to get high and relax. This path of opiates is one of disaster and heartache. You will lose personal belongings, money, your friends, your family, and most of all yourself. It's not worth it. I'm sure you'll do what you want, as did I, but please just consider the consequences.",

    "selftext": "I have been addicted to opiates and any other mind altering substance I could buy for twelve years. I‚Äôve tried every major drug out there except for mescaline, but if I had access to it I sure would have. My life growing up was great, got good grades, had loving parents, lots of friends, went to college. Nothing really caused me to use other than the fact that I liked the way these drugs felt. I started opiates, mainly roxi 30s and the original crushable OxyContin in 2010 when I was in 10th grade in high school. I lived in a small town in ocean county New Jersey. I supported my habit by selling weed at school. I started off small, and my dealing grew. A lot of people bought off me because I never cheated anyone and I was an overall great guy with a good personality. This made my marijuana dealing skyrocket, and with that came more money which fueled my pain killer habit. Fast forward to when I‚Äôm in college in 2013 and I‚Äôm still selling. Around this time the manufactur of OxyContin changed the formula to mak them uncrushable and would jell up. Doctors shoping as a whole dried up because of new laws which made it difficult to get pain killers. So I progressed to heroin. This decision led to a downward spiral in my life that I finally have come out of. It caused me to loose everything. I moved around from hotel to hotel, living with prostitution and drug dealers. I was selling heroin at this point to support my habit. I eventually meet my fianc√© in 2019. I moved in with her to her apartment rite outside Philadelphia, in merchantville nj. Once I started coping in Philly around 2018 heroin was no longer heroin. It became fentanyl. Philly does this nasty thing and laces the fentanyl with xylazine horse tranquilizer. This causes necrosis of the skin which leads to infection. Because of my fianc√©s and my own drug use, we both got nasty infections. She wasn‚Äôt so lucky, and the infection went to her blood and she died July 7th 2021. After she died I went into a huge depression. I lost the apartment we managed to keep together and became homeless on the streets of Kensington Philadelphia. The only reason I was able to stop using was because I ended up crashing my car after boosting from homedepot, and went to the hospital for the infection on my leg. I could barley walk when I got to the hospital because the infection was so bad. I went to emergency surgery, had 3 blood transfusions because my hemoglobin levels were at a 3 when they are supposed to be a 13. The xylazine apparently causes this life threatening anemia, and the doctors said if I didn‚Äôt come in when I did, I would not have made it a few more days. My infection was so bad that my bone was exposed. I put off going to the hospital because the fear of withdrawal. But thank god Jefferson university hospital treats addicts humanly. They performed emergency debridement on my legs to cut away the infections, and they put me on IV antibiotics, hydro morphone, and ketamine. I spent two weeks in the hospital on antibiotics and they microinducted me on suboxone. I had no where to go after My discharge, and my sweet mother let me stay with her in South Carolina. I haven‚Äôt lived with my parents since I was 17, but I had no other options at this point. The day I got discharged I got picked up by her and moved 500 miles away from Kensington. I got enrolled in a suboxone program where my appointments, therapy sessions, and medication is completely free. If I stayed in Kensington I would have died. That city brought me to my knees worst than any other place I have been. It‚Äôs 24/7 365 days a year open air drug market and no one cares if you get high. It‚Äôs an addicts dream and nightmare. I knew if I stayed around that area, it would be a matter of time before I relapsed . It‚Äôs been 3 months since I‚Äôve used, and my life and health is turning around. I just wanted to write this because I never thought I would get clean, and was planing on dying in the streets of Kensington. But life gets better, and no matter what situation your in, you can turn it around. I know it‚Äôs clich√© but take it one day at a time. If anyone is struggling and needs to talk DM me. It can never hurt to bounce thoughts and ideas with someone to get a new perspective.",

It was 5 days of administering opiates every 4 hours, and my aunt didn't want to feel like she killed her mom. It was my responsibility to physically give grandma her doses. \n\nAt first she could swallow, and the pills could go in applesauce. Then the nurse \"showed\" me (pretending all this pill stuff was new to me) how I needed to grind the pills up and dilute with water so I could squirt the medicine into her mouth. \nThen it was on to the liquid morphine for her last two days. \n\nI was there when my grandma passed and it was not peaceful. It wasn't brave and it didn't feel kind. I kissed her three times on her forehead (I love you) and called the nurse immediately to come. \n\nI was SO ANGRY. There was a lot of leftover medicine. I put it all in a pile and just had to leave. I walked around my grandma's neighborhood aimlessly. I missed them taking my grandma away. \n\nI wanted to use the leftover medicine *so badly*. And it made me hate myself, and feel small, and disgusting. And I have no one to talk about this with. \n\nI am happy I didn't relapse but... I'm sad it seems like I will never feel fully free of this addiction.",

    "selftext": "\nI'm 4+ years clean with 1 \"relapse\" several months ago. It was only 80mg roughly, so no high, just desperation. \n\n\nI have a chronic health condition which has given me chronic/life long pain. This was how my addiction started, as I was diagnosed at around 13 and sent home with a lot of opiates and oramorph. I wasnt living with either of my parents at the time and so no one noticed I was abusing them. My doctors believed me when, after a week of trying one opiate it \"wasnt working\", so theyd prescribe me a month of another. Codeine, dihydra, tramadol. Rinse and repeat for years. Round off with a seizure and my drug program contacting my doctors, I got clean. I think my age and background (well spoken, lower middle class) ment they assumed I wasnt abusing them.\n\n\nI'm still offered opiates for some reason. Maybe because my \"dependency\"** was before I was 18 so, in my country, I believe it was wiped from my medical record*. I always say no, even in inpatient for pain, because I dont want to remember how pain free I could be. I know if I do, I will get it back on prescription and fall back into my addiction. \n\n\nLast week my pain condition began to flare again. Bad pain, and I was losing some blood.\n\n\nI called my doctor and she asked if I had tried codeine for my pain, I explained I was previously dependent** on codeine and so hadnt gone near it in a long time. She asked if I felt safe with a prescription for it and I said that, honestly, I dont. \n\n\nShe said that in future a low dose of codeine may be a good idea if the pain doesnt end, but I know it isnt. They could give me 1mg pills and I'd still find a way. They could give me co-codamol and I'd just CWE the codeine, or fuck my renal system up taking them all whole. I appreciate she was doing her duty to keep my pain bearable but I wish I could ask my doctors and team to not mention opiates again. \n\n\nAnyway, I said no. I said no several times. And when my room mate mentioned he was prescribed it (back injury) I explained to him my previous issues and we agreed he would never, under any circumstances, let me have a single pill. Even if I was screaming in agony, no opiates. Ever.\n\n\nI dont really know the point of sharing this, other than to be heard by like minded people. I know not many other people here will be recovering from prescription pain opiate abuse but if anyone will, it will be someone here. \n\n\n\nI hope everyone is managing quarantine okay. Thanks for reading.\n\n\n\n\n*I live in the UK where adolescents medical records are hard to access after the person in question turns 18. It's near impossible to access your own adolescent health records even with permission, and a friend who requested his found most things had been removed. \n\n\n\n**I was told by a nurse to say \"codeine/opiate dependent\" instead of addict. She said I would be taken more seriously and treated with more respect. I'm not sure how true this is but thought I'd share if it helps anyone else. The language is a little less stigmatized, I guess.",

Running has been my medicine during this process. A few notes for those who are on the same journey:\n\n* I still want to use, but the cravings are FAR less than they were a month ago.\n* The roller coaster of brain chemicals has settled way down. I will still have a few good days and then a few bad days, but the good is happening more and more and the bad less and less.\n* I have much less anxiety. I'm far more calm and level-headed. Social confidence is much improved.\n* My mind feels sharper and much more present in the moment. I feel more connected to my surroundings.\n* I often get the warm and fuzzy feeling in my body that I used to associate with opioids. I assume this is my natural endorphins returning. It happens often when I wake up in the morning or after a good meal.\n* Perhaps TMI, but my testosterone levels must have increased because all sexual functions have returned to normal.\n* Beginning to run was a turning point for me. Things improved at an accelerated rate once I started doing that. \n\nOne thing that's very interesting and I've heard from other recovering addicts is how it eventually becomes apparent just how sick your addicted mind was. It will bend reality in every way it can to try to justify using again. It's truly no wonder so many people don't make it out of this addiction. I'm actually certain that my mind is STILL quite warped, and I will only realize how much at a future date. \n\nAnyhow, that's it. 61 days and still going.",

Earlier this week, I went to the running store and got fitted for a really nice pair of running shoes, bought a few other pieces of running gear, and set off to see if I could get some dopamine flowing with good old fashioned cardio.

Having never posted here then, I got a comment saying I was ‚Äúbaiting‚Äù or ‚Äútrolling‚Äù and it was disrespectful towards the members. I deleted my post but then got a message from a user, she said she saw my post and in case I was genuine, wanted to help me. I cried my eyes out that moment because I've never had someone who wanna help me irl, and for a random stranger on the internet who doesn't even know me to go out her way to dm me with empathy was my first time ever..\n\nFor the first time in my life I didn't feel alone, and that 1000s of people are going thru the same shit I'm facing.. Well, was clean for a month or so, and i felt like i gave a huge ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù to the person who was so kind to me when i relapsed. \nFast forward to February this year, I finally made the firm choice to quit for good this time, so after hundreds of withdrawals, hundreds of relapses over just a span of 2 years addiction, with 3 failed suicide attempts, I know it isn't that big an achievement but I'm happy that I'm over 7 months clean and don't have any desire to fall in that hell anymore.\n\nWhat saved my life was coming over here, and reading the posts yall made, how some of you are addicted for years, or been clean for years, and to compare that to my young age and my duration of usage, it was so small.. I used to think to myself, why should i ruin my life, why should I kill myself, when literally people has had it worse than me, and made it thru?\n\nFor once in my life, because of this sub, i realize that i wasn't alone in this hellhole, that you guys here are much more polite, helpful and welcoming than the people I have irl, and from the bottom of my heart I want to thank you all for saving my life. Even though I'm not even a year clean yet, I literally have no desire to ever use it anymore.\n\nI'm almost 23 now, still got my whole life ahead of me, will be graduating college in a few months and hopefully live my life to the fullest. I plan to move to a better environment, make new and good friends, and hopefully never fall in this trap anymore..

    "selftext": "Today I celebrated going one whole year without opiates. It‚Äôs been a long road to get here. Countless attempts to quit. I struggled with opiates for nearly a decade. And today I can say I have not taken any pills in ONE WHOLE ASS YEAR!!!! \nThat feels so amazing to say. So proud of myself. I never imagined I would be here. People. If you are struggling. Please just keep going. Stay clean. Life gets so much better. It is such a relief to not have the physical,mental and financial strain that comes with chasing pills anymore. I still have to stop and appreciate that fact every couple days it‚Äôs an amazing feeling. In the last year. I have started to fix my finances. I have lost 50 lbs. I workout. I‚Äôm working on my mental health with a professional. And overall I just feel so much better have so much more energy and a much more positive outlook on life. it is nite and day. I really don‚Äôt even come on this sub anymore. Once you get thru the first few months. And start to see and feel the difference It almost becomes easy when you are still able to remember how badly that life sucks. I remember being in the early days with all that dread and how much of a struggle it is when your counting minutes and hours. I would come to this sub and see people‚Äôs posts and it would give me hope. so please please stick with it. I promise you will not regret it.",

She talked often about how much this page meant to her. I doubt she ever meant for me to read any of it. She sent me a screenshot a year ago and didn‚Äôt crop out her username. I never read any of it to keep her privacy. I just remembered the screenshot last night so I scrolled back to find it. \n\nI spent hours pouring over what she wrote. So many things that made me smile and so many things that made me cry. I‚Äôm not an addict and she always said I couldn‚Äôt understand. She‚Äôs right, I couldn‚Äôt. But the way she talked to you guys is how I WISH she would have explained things to me. I‚Äôm in the stage of guilt and pain (Google the 7 stages of grief) and while we had a good relationship I wish I had made it better. Reach out to your loved ones. Tell them you want to confide in them. Tell it to them straight how you were feeling. One of her posts said that her dealer was trying to contact her during her sobriety (she later relapsed). If she had told me I would have helped her. I love her so much and I wish I could just hug her.\n\nSorry, I‚Äôm rambling.\n\nHer very last comment was celebrating another person‚Äôs 1 year sobriety mark. She was 3 months sober. A really big accomplishment for her. At this time we don‚Äôt know how she died. No drugs were found near her body and she was at home. Unfortunately her husband was still actively using and constantly putting her sobriety at risk.\n\nWe will be doing an autopsy and toxicology to know what happened. She had Covid a month ago and was still struggling with fatigue, dizziness, and other symptoms. It‚Äôs possible it was a blood clot and she didn‚Äôt break her sobriety.\n\nStay strong. She talked about this page often and how much she would lean on all of you.\n\nShe made a request awhile back for a funeral song if the time ever came‚Ä¶. She chose ‚ÄúJesus, Etc‚Äù Wilco.

    "title": "\"Addicts are notorious for not being able to tolerate discomfort\"",
    "selftext": "Hey you lovely people. I'm a 25 year old woman in the UK addicted to codeine and Pregabalin. But, as with all your stories, it's a lot deeper than that. \n\n\n\nI read this sentence in someone else's comment and I suddenly realised how I got here. \n\n\n\nWhen the pandemic began in March 2020, I stopped going to work in the office and worked from home instead. I stopped getting up early every day, walking to work in all weathers, stopped exercising almost completely. In essence, I totally stopped tolerating any discomfort whatsoever. I lost that drive to work through discomfort and pain in order to feel the benefit of the reward at the end, whether that's through cardio and weights at the gym leading to a healthier body and mind, or a long week in the office leading to a weekend of relaxing. \n\n\nI met a drug dealer last summer and went on a multi-month binge of rotating substances including cocaine, ketamine, tramadol, valium, morphine and dihydrocodeine. I almost lost my job because I couldn't stay awake during the day - being strung out and having my bed and sofa there whilst I was supposed to be working was too tempting. I started taking pills and doing lines from the moment I woke up in the morning, answering emails and phone calls intoxicated on whatever I was addicted to in that moment. \n\n\nI was also dealing with the end of an incredibly emotionally and sexually abusive relationship. I couldn't handle the overwhelming pain, distress and despair I was feeling; the obsessive, intrusive thoughts about everything he'd done to me, and the crushing weight of my newfound loneliness. I wanted to feel dead without being dead. I wanted to feel nothing at all. \n\n\nI'm still addicted to pregabalin and codeine, and I'd been feeling really awful about myself regarding these pervading addictions recently. I still go through withdrawal at least once a month. I still feel powerless and as though my entire life is going round in circles on an endless loop of the same shit. \n\nI suffer very badly from mental ill health including major depressive disorder, OCD, anxiety and a dissociative disorder, which definitely complicates things. \n\nBut - fuck, I feel a lot better for typing that out. Somehow I came back from where I was last summer. Somehow I've nearly finished my Master's in Creative Writing, somehow I kept my job in IT and even got a new weekend one at a vape shop to start building my savings back up. Somehow I've been going to the gym regularly, running 5ks and deadlifting and squatting and pushing myself to really feel pain and discomfort again. \n\n\nEverything is still messy as fuck but it's getting better. I'm on my second day of withdrawals from codeine and I'm determined to stop chasing my tail this time. I'll deal with the pregabalin addiction later.",

I used pills about 4 times and overdosed 2 of them, 110 vikes and 20 xans in a weekend. Now, my DOC bf pills was weed. I was certainly addicted to that. Smoking 6-8 times a day for months. I was addicted to alcohol. I used DXM, Acid, Benedryl, snorting my own prescriptions, whippets, etc,. I CANNOT handle drugs. I'm glad I know that today. I was at a crossroads.

We have a mail-order naloxone program that we started advertising to public in January. For anybody who uses opioids and anybody who interacts with them, naloxone is vital to have on hand. Ohioans can go to https://www.harmreductionohio.org/get-naloxone/ and order Narcan nasal spray or intramuscular intramuscular for free to be delivered via mail. I personally package and ship the majority of the orders. Five people last month reported that the kits they received in the mail were used to save somebody's life. Having this medication on hand can make all the difference during an overdose.\n\nIf you live in the US but not in Ohio, you can still get free mail-order naloxone at https://www.naloxoneforall.org/.\n\nIf you are financially willing and able, we would greatly appreciate a donation of any amount. We are a very small non-profit organization funded exclusively by grants at the moment. It costs about $5 to ship each package, including supplies and postage. I would like for this program to go on for many years, but that will only be possible if we can get the funding.

    "selftext": "Three years ago, I went to treatment for the last time. I was so broken in so many ways. The alcohol I was drinking and the heroin and crack I was shooting weren't numbing the pain I had inside anymore.\n\nIt wasn't masking the grief, the disappointment, the emptiness anymore.\n\nAbout a week and a half prior to my last treatment, I called my parents and asked them to drive me 3.5 hours to this facility. My parents always loved me and supported me, but knew that forced treatment would never work. I packed my bag and got high in the back of the car the whole way there.\n\nThis time in treatment was different than the ones before: I really wanted it this time. I took suggestion and didn't return home. I got honest with myself and did some pretty significant trauma work. I remembered the feeling of dopesickness and decided I never wanted to experience that again. And so I put in the work.\n\nI did multiple 90 in 90s. I worked in treatment. I set goals and put forth effort to accomplish them. Eventually, I got so caught up in my life the days just kept passing and getting high didn't cross my mind. The obsession was lifted.\n\nI've been through some pretty tough shit in the past three years. My boyfriend relapsed 13 months in and went back to rehab. One of my best friends died in a tragic car accident. I've dealt with stressors of jobs, school, and moving across the country. I used all the skills I developed in treatment and in the rooms to help me. And guess what, they actually work!\n\nToday I define myself as: a fiance, a homeowner, a graduate student, a dog mom, a loyal employee, a person who shows up when needed and even when I'm not asked to. I become a better person every single day. I love myself and feel so much gratitude toward everyone and everything around me.\n\nAnd I'm not sure where this post is going anymore. I remember when I was in very early recovery and I would hear people talk about how they had multiple years of sobriety and I would say to myself, \"I can't wait for that to be me.\" And today that is me. And I won't ever stop putting one foot in front of the other down this path of recovery. I thought the whole \"life beyond your wildest dreams\" was bullshit, but eventually it is true.

    "selftext": "\n\n\nFor 5 years on the daily, I would shoplift. First 3 years was Poppy Seeds(I am \"lucky\" enough to live in an extremely polish neighbourhood and they love their poppy seeds, so they were at every deli on every corner.) Then the last 2 years on Loperamide(Anyone who says this is a placebo is an idiot, using them to get high or to slow taper makes you a bigger idiot.) If you were to of asked me a year ago where I'd be today, it would be \"hopeless and lost, still on loperamide.\"  I think the best way to get yourself out of this mindset within the opiate haze is to think about just how non-sensical the world is. \"Pyrotherapy\" was a treatment/possible cure for syphilis. It included infecting the person with Malaria, which made your temperature 102+ Fahrenheit. This took the chance of death from 100% to about 30%. For some reason, it cured or completely suppressed it. Nobody knows why. Medieval\u001b royalty would wear bedazzled goats gallstones because when dipped into wine it would remove arsenic. There was no basis for this but science checked and it is 100% legit. It actually works. The Lobotomy won a Nobel Peace Prize. Nitroglycerin is used in micro dosages to help ease chest pain. Know what dynamite is? Nitroglycerin stabilized in clay. The aforementioned facts I would never believe in a million years if it wasn't for seeing it myself. Just like me being almost 11 months sober (4/8/17) now. I'm on 2mg of Suboxone daily(started on 16) and the taper has been near painless. If you feel like you can't get out, it's because you never knew freedom. Your life before opiates, and on opiates is not what your life is supposed to be. You cannot keep yourself trapped in all the cognitive dissonance. The thought of \"Things will never be the same.\" Yes. Things are going to change and change is scary. Especially when you don't know what beast this \"change\" is going to manifest as. You are going to be taking a complete shot in the dark when you quit. Look up an outpatient program in your area that preferably isn't state funded. I am in Chicago and went to Gateway after a 4-day taper and was truly hurting. If you make the call and go for the meet up with an addiction recovery specialist these people will give you the hook up to see a doctor that DAY within a few hours for Suboxone and other medications that may ease the pain as they see fit. For a little bit Suboxone won't get you through the day but you need to be patient and let everything strip off your opioid receptors. Avoid Methadone, unless it's absolutely necessary; Suboxone is a superior product. It will keep you from going back chemically and you cant really get high on it, whereas methadone you can get high on and the withdrawal is worse than any other opiate. It is just a slippery slope. What to expect is a  lot of crying, obsessions with primetime dramas, and obsession with time. Crying is a way your body releases cortisol, the stress hormone, so please do not stop yourself, let it all out. Find a show or several to be obsessed with, make sure it hurts to watch. Crying is the release of a lifetime within withdrawal. First I will list some activities and other remedies to avoid.\n\nMarijuana: You do not want to replace one depressant with another, even if Marijuana is incredibly less destructive. But it will prevent you from getting back on your feet. If you live somewhere where it is legal, then it can help with PAWS quite substantially, however, so does finding your way to the path to comfort. I don't recommend CBD either. \n\n\nKratom: Unless you have a family member administering this then stay away. This can start a new habit up, and there are withdrawals. But if your dosage is supervised then get Indo of the white variety as it is the most calming. \n\nLoperamide: This is an opiate, and it is very hard to find what a good dosage to take is. Avoid it unless you are supervised to be taking the recommended dosage. \n\nBenzos: Yes they do help, but unless you are prescribed them for something other than your recovery, stay away. They are even more addictive, and you think that opiate withdrawals are bad? Benzo withdrawal is a hell like no other and can last years. This include Klonopin(clonazepam) Xanax(alprazolam) Valium(diazepam) Ativan(lorazepam) Restoril(temazepam) and Halcion(triazolam)\n\nZ-drugs These are the common insomnia medications Ambien, Lunesta, and Sonata. Same reason as for benzos. Plus the side effects alone should be enough to have you say \"screw this\"\n\n\"Lesser Opiates\" (Codeine, dihydrocodeine, Tramadol) These are still opiates, just because they don't have the same kick doesn't mean you're sober. Codeine and Tramadol are pro-drugs, meaning when they break down in your liver they create morphine. This will only delay your recovery. \n\nOTC Sleep Aids: This is a case by case basis but these are anti-histamines which are allergy medications. The side effects of these amplify every single symptom of the withdrawal for quite a lot of people, and higher dosages have adverse stimulant effects, and even higher dosages have deliriant effects. Horrible hallucinations.\n\nAlcohol: It may sound smart to drink yourself into a stupor to get through the withdrawals. But along with the obvious issues of dependency, alcohol is a mental depressant that can very easily put you over the edge emotionally to do the thing you may be thinking of doing. On top of that, it is a cardiovascular stimulant so your blood pressure spikes and your body just wants it gone. The hangover mixed with withdrawals...are you crazy? Alcohol is the WORST idea.\n\nAny Stimulant: Avoid coffee like the plague, and all amphetamines along with the rest of the ADHD medication catalogue. You will feel better for a couple hours then the crash makes everything worse for days.  If you're prescribed any of these, my non-medical opinion is to take a break while you're going through the beginning of the withdrawals. I shouldn't even have to mention cocaine. If you're a smoker you will want to do it more, but try to cut back a bit. Not too much though, or else the withdrawals from the nicotine will just make everything worse. If you vape, monitor your dosage. Try not to smoke as much towards the end of the day so you have an easier time sleeping.\n\nPhone: This puts you into the world you were in as a junkie. Have a trusted loved one delete all of your contacts, texts, emails, any correspondence with friends that use or old dealers. Even have them go through pictures. You are removing these people from your life. They don't belong on your phone anymore.\n\n\n\nI'm not a doctor so I will not give dosages and this is more of a list of things to look into using while prepping for withdrawal. This is what I know works for me. I have an A.A.S and my major was Biochem for a year before I had to drop out of school due to my habit. I used the knowledge learned there to put this together for myself. . Once again. I'm not a doctor, just an educated idiot. I was essentially my own lab rat.\n\nDo not let the chemical names scare you, they are simple supplements I picked up at Vitamin Shoppe.\n\nl-tyrosine(I recommend using a lower dosage than anything recommended IF you so choose to follow my path. This is the amino acid your body uses to make norepinephrine and dopamine, so it can suck if your heart is going a million miles a minute and your legs won't stop moving. But this gave me the motivation to search out my plan of how I will occupy myself. I even had a few genuine smiles. The dopamine is welcome when everything feels so pleasureless.)\n\nDextromethorphan: This will conquer the flu-like symptoms. Also, this is an analogue of Codeine but is NOT an opiate and does not delay the recovery time. Take the dosage on the box, do NOT drink it to get high, this will just destroy a vital tool in your recovery.\n\nRegular multivitamin for whatever your designated sex was at birth(This is simply because your body needs all the help it can get achieving homeostasis, where it is making everything on its own again, vitamins are important! No need for extra b vitamins after this because after about 200% of your daily recommended dosage you piss it out.) \n\nOmega 3-6-9 Fatty Oils (I took this because it does wonders for inflammation, can also help with the depression. Is again apart of aiding your body in achieving homeostasis.)\n\nGlutamine(This is an essential amino acid that is used by your body to heal, and that is exactly what is being done during withdrawal. It is taken where a protein is needed and there is nothing else to be there. Also helps with the cramps and stomach pain. HOMEOSTASIS)\n\nMagnesium(Does wonders for anxiety. It is mind-blowing. Honestly taking a mega-dose feels like you popped a Xanax that lasts 15 minutes. But this is NOT what I did because magnesium cleans out the colon like no other.... Also, mega-dosing is not something I want to be doing as a recovering drug addict. It's addict behaviour. And I didn't need anything else keeping me in the bathroom.) I took this as needed and tried to not take too much at once. But sometimes the trade-off of being relieved of anxiety while sitting on the toilet for a few hours was worth it.)\n\nWhey Protein (I couldn't bring myself to eat so I would have small shakes twice a day. You really can feel the difference. You NEED sustenance)\n\nCayyene Pepper (Capsules of it. It helps with pain, inflammation, and stops you from going to the bathroom every 5 seconds. Also helps normalize glucose levels, glucose makes sweet sweet endorphins. Also speeds up your metabolism Its known to give people the sweats. I didn't notice a difference, however.)\n\nValerian Root: A miracle. I took very small doses throughout the day, then before bed took a bit higher than the normal recommended dosage. It creates sweet sweet GABA, the nurturing grandmother of neuroreceptors. I felt more hopeful, and it stopped the shakes along with the racing thoughts. \n\nL-tryptophan(the amino acid that creates 5-HTP, which breaks down into serotonin and melatonin. Do not take melatonin directly, as tolerance messes with your circadian rhythm and that is precious. It is apart of coming back to homeostasis, therefore a vital part of recovery.)\n\n5-htp: This is more direct than L-tryptophan, I took it at night to help me go to sleep while the L-tryptophan helped me stay asleep. In the beginning, I also took Magnesium along with it.(Less than the recommended dosage, so I didn't shit the bed.\n\nTonic Water: This has quinine in it. Along with it being very good at staving off Malaria, it also does a damn good job at kicking Restless Leg Syndromes ass. I drank 2 glasses before bed.\n\nMeditation: Never leave home without it! I was lucky enough to of done a 10-day Buddhist retreat back in the day to help me learn. My recommendation is to write down a mantra, something you repeat to get yourself aligned with your goals. (\"I am loved.\" \"I am conquering this.\" \"I am free from suffering\" \"I should shower\") Whatever works! Focus on your breath. How it feels. There are amazing phone apps for guided meditation if you need any help.\n\nLove: Reach out everywhere, you aren't as alone as you thought. Call up your parents, your kids, your NA sponsor, a friend. Anybody that feels like support is good. You may of let a lot of people down but you will find that the mental hurdle is forgiving yourself, not them forgiving you. So reach out anyways.\n\nThis might be taken down. I don't know. I tried not to come off as giving medical advice. It was just sad that I came here and saw so many scared posts and felt that I could quell some of the fear as someone who has been there. You are not alone. \n\n",

    "selftext": "If the instinct to pour water on yourself while you are on fire is selfish, then consider an addict selfish. Put any human in enough pain and every single one of us will buckle. That doesn‚Äôt make us bad, it makes us human. \n\nI am absolutely astonished to see how some, of what I assume to be, former addicts, talk about those who are currently sick. \n\nI have certainly noticed in in-person life how some in recovery talk about addiction as though they know nothing about it. They genuinely think they are clean because of their morals or willpower. \n\nI guarantee, that if you use the shit that‚Äôs out there today long enough, you too will get to the point where you will be sentenced to watch everything you do with utter horror, as though you were watching a monster on a movie screen. \n\nYou know you‚Äôre not a monster. You know you wouldn‚Äôt do these things if you could be free from the exhausting, relentless drive to use use use. But this is now your life, and only maybe, if you‚Äôre incredibly lucky and/or someone gives a shit about you, you may have a chance to escape. \n\nI got to the point that I was constantly filthy, my clothes were filthy, my environment was filthy, I spoke to no one and cared about nothing but getting well. I lied to, stole from, put in danger the people I love the very most in this world. Myself included. I could no longer recognize myself. \n\nI. Could. Not. Stop. I couldn‚Äôt *want* to stop. I couldn‚Äôt choose to stop. I could only desperately wish I could want to stop. 20 years-in and with fentanyl, fentalogues, tranqdope, etc. on the street, withdrawals are no longer 3 days and done. Not only has the dope gotten worse, the disease progresses. Withdrawals and cravings ramp up exponentially. \n\nI would leave a 30 day rehab with the same desperation to use as I went in with. I didn‚Äôt have insurance as a lifelong user and methadone and suboxone clinics were way beyond my financial grasp. I was the definition of hopeless and I did horrendous things on a daily basis. I‚Äôve been to some form of inpatient rehab 13 times. \n\nI wasn‚Äôt a piece of shit, morally bankrupt, or willfully malicious. I was incredibly sick. I didn‚Äôt know what to do, nor could I any longer see getting better as a goal which was attainable to me. \n\nThe disease of addiction sometimes begins with one bad choice, no different than any other of the stupid choices every human being makes in life. And sometimes it starts with doctor‚Äôs orders. After that, it‚Äôs a disease caused by the rewiring of the brain that results from drug use. \n\nHow did I stop? I had 1 person left who met the following criteria: 1. They still gave a shit about me. 2. They were able to make it financially feasible to get into a Suboxone clinic. 3. They were able to make it materially feasible to have a roof over my head. If any 1 of those criteria hadn‚Äôt been met, I would be dead or worse right now.\n\nI had torched the earth around me until there was nothing left to torch. I had hit the uttermost depths of rock bottom to the point that my only alternative was try or die. Can you stop before you get to this point? Sure, if you‚Äôre lucky.",

    "selftext": "I was an addict for more years of my life than I was sober. I used opiates to deal with the mental pain of life. I'm not going to write a sob story, but my life growing up wasn't sunshine and roses as I'm sure is the same for most people who are addicted. I was getting so far gone and pushing the pain I had gone through in life so far down and not dealing with it, that it was rotting inside of me. It was starting to make me legitimately crazy. I cared some, but not much, and not enough to get off drugs. I had tried before just to stop, but I didn't realize how much work was going to be involved, what I was in for, or where to begin. It took me three years of trying different methods like methadone, rehab, suboxone, meditation and therapy to finally get to the starting line of what I thought was the path to sobriety.\n\nWhile going through all of this it was like I was marching up a snowy mountain with a backpack on. I was tightly holding my shoulder straps, trudging through the snow uphill one step at a time. After a couple of months I would lift my head up to see I was still in the exact same place. So again, I put my head down and trudged on. For over a year it seemed like I was in the same place every time I looked up. I had learned a lot though while walking. I truly learned the meaning of patience and calmness and finally understood this is a marathon not a sprint. I learned that hope was the only thing I had in the most desperate times when I felt like just giving up and setting down in the snow, not to care anymore. In the mind of my mind, I was climbing a ladder or the steps of a pyramid. Every lesson was like an ascension of knowing who I was and what I had to do. Like going through the chakras to start at red over and over again, growing the whole time.\n\nOne day things changed a little as I felt some tension release. I didn't realize I was over the crest, just knew it was starting to get easier and I felt myself descending down the other side. Still learning in the mind of my mind lessons to take with me. I learned it is okay to just be okay with yourself. That being ashamed and the fear and anxiety that came along with it weren't going to help me on my travels, so I had to shed that baggage to get where I wanted to be. People don't look at you and see what you think of yourself. They just see what is in front of them at that moment. So, if you're doing better, that is the picture you project. They don't know the challenges you're facing in your mind and body to just make it through the day. So again, my head down I keep trudging through the snow down the side of the mountain.\n\nOne day I felt something completely different. I had accepted the snow and the mountain and without knowing where I was, I look up and there isn't any snow. I'm coming into a valley with a beautiful meadow, and I can shed some of my baggage knowing I'm in a better place. I still have my journey ahead but I'm feeling better about each step, still learning in the mind of my mind. I have this energy inside of me that wants to persevere. I want to be a good person and give off a good energy for others to realize anything is possible.\n\nFeeling light and free I walk to the edge of the meadow with my shoulders tall and straight from everything I've carried and learned to cope with. The mind of my mind gave way to me being myself and knowing who I was. I felt whole once more. As I make my way through the trees there is a beautiful little stream. I wash myself and stand up a clean person, free and ready to face the world as I had never known before. As I look around with my eyes clear, in that moment I realize, this is beautiful!",

We fell deeply in love through letters as crazy as it may seem. It was so nice to just have someone to listen. Someone who saw past all my bullshit to that inner child who is vulnerable and sweet. When I got out we were married within 4 months. She was my everything, the love of my life. She left me after 4 years. While she was gone I tried heroin for the 1st time. Actually my first shot was heroin and cocaine. Me and my wife patched things up after a month. She started using heroin with me when she found out. We were the same person, do as much as I can as fast as I can. Push the envelope. After a year of on and off using and trying recovery we decided it was best if I moved back home to get clean and she went to her moms. We couldn‚Äôt get clean together the moment I saw her sick I went and picked up. I just couldn‚Äôt bear seeing her that way. I moved home and cleaned up for about three months. She decided to go to rehab and right before she left she broke off our marriage. She said she was used to being alone. I of course relapsed. I found a dealer here and I‚Äôve gotten progressively worse since. There hasn‚Äôt been a day I‚Äôve been sober in almost a year and a half. I‚Äôm using iv fent about 1 gram a day and meth. I‚Äôve lost everything. My job, my wife, my car, my home, my dignity, emotion. I don‚Äôt know how to beat this. I think about cleaning up and I genuinely want to, but I just ask myself what‚Äôs the fucking point? I can never forgive myself for getting her on heroin, ruining our marriage.

I have been down a very long and dark road and lost everything to drugs. My home, baby pictures, everything to the clothes on my back. I am now doing better for myself getting my GED and everything. I wan't to let you who need to hear it know, it DOES get better. Cravings for me lasted a good year before subsiding. The first year is the hardest especially if you used all day everyday. You need to get over that year and it will get better. Also if you need to I would suggest Suboxone for the cravings I actually had such bad cravings that I had to take Suboxone in order to not relapse or drink my self to death on the really hard days. Some people judge the people on the Sub/methadone but its whatever works for you. Its worth it to do that than to continue the cycle. I am currently still on Suboxone but only 4 MG daily and it helped me ALOT. I started using opiates when I was 15 daily until 21. Started with pills and then you know the rest, next thing you know IV H use.  I am now 24 so all my brain knew was drugs it didn't know anything else so I felt it was the right choice for me. Anyway, if anyone here wants to talk or hear my story I am here! God bless all and YOU CAN DO IT!!! Nothing is impossible remember that even if it feels like it is. My DM's are always open. ‚ô•\n\nEdit: Wow thanks for my first ever reward!!\n\nEdit 2: Update in case anyone wants to know: 5 years clean in April! It's coming up! I think it's 5 otherwise it's 4 I actually don't count I know that's odd since alot of people do but I just never did . I know I quit around Easter and I met my boyfriend around the same time a little before and we are going on 5 years, so it's probably about 5 years clean! I hope everyone is doing well and hanging in there it's a tough road but it's absolutely worth it.

So I just finished doing yard work preparing for my son‚Äôs 2nd birthday this Saturday and I go to move out the cars from the drive way. As my girlfriend and I are walking down the front yard, out of the corner of my eye 5 feet away from my front door I spot a piece of foil. We had a small BBQ with close friends the day before in the back yard and I thought there‚Äôs no way foil is here cause I cleaned up after the bbq. As I got closer I say burn marks on the foil and I thought ‚Äúno fucking way‚Äù I pick it up and I see there‚Äôs still heroin on the foil, about 5 bucks worth. In my shock, I call out to my girlfriend and told her what I found and I told her to get rid of it and I went back inside the house to wash my hands. The devil is at work and I was tested when I least expected it. The wind blew it up to my front door.

    "selftext": "I see this debated all the time in comments, but I never see a good argument against it being an opioid. I would like to hear the arguments against it being one. Here is my logic.\n\nAn Opioid is a substance that acts on opioid receptors to produce a morphine like effect.\n\nKratom targets the mu and delta opioid receptors. The same receptors morphine binds to, minus the kappa receptor.\n\nKratom is also known as a pain killer, because it creates the same analgesic effects morphine does.\n\nBoth boxes are a check. \n\n\nIf you want to dive a bit deeper, opioids are broken down into 3 groups beneath opioids. Natural opioids like morphine, semi-synthetic like heroin or oxycodone, and synthetic opioids like fentanyl. Natural Opioids do not have to be derived from the poppy somniferum flower, which would make at least 1 chemical in Kratom a Natural Opioid.\n\n\n\nWe need have a consensus on this amongst ourselves. I see people recommend to use kratom as a comfort med all the time, but it‚Äôs not helpful toward the ultimate goal of getting off of opioids, unless you‚Äôre purposefully using it to taper. New comers should be well informed about kratom, if they read a recommendation for it. \n\nI am in no way discouraging long term kratom treatment. I am advocating for properly informing people to be aware it‚Äôs a long term treatment plan and is still an opioid before they start on it.\n\nThoughts?",

    "selftext": "Reposting under a different title.\n\n**STORY:**\n\n* Got sober at 23 and was a rockstar in recovery for 10+ years. But before I get to the 5 steps that changed my life and I swear will change yours, let me share my bottom. I was a white kid raised in the suburbs in an upper middle class family. ANYONE looking in would have never guessed what was coming. But having strict parents and never feeling \"comfortable\" at home pushed me to spend more time partying with friends. This trend continued through my second year of college where I was on academic probation and on the verge of failing out.\n* During that summer I was in a situation where I had stolen property on me. It was connected to 3 home burglaries and I genuinely did not know who committed them. I was charged with 3 counts felony burglary/ 3 counts felony theft/ 3 counts felony unlawful trespass. My bail was $100,000. My parents bailed me out and got me a lawyer. He had been a previous states attorney and we thought he'd understand, be able to help, be able to get the court to see the position I was in. But that was not my story to be. This attorney viewed me as a criminal, deserving to be punished, and scared my family and I pretty quickly into taking a deal. Or else risk 30 years as a first time offender for non violent crime. Maybe he was right, but most everyone in my life who knows this story has a hard time talking about what happened. What was the deal for someone in possession of stolen property you might ask? What is the punishment for a non violent crime, no drugs dealt, no body harmed, no weapons, not even a connection to the scene of the crime? 10 YEARS. 10 years in prison is what a states attorney and my lawyer thought fair for being in possession of stolen property. (on par with rape, manslaughter, and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon). I had never even been in a fight before.\n\n**PRISON**\n\n* I wound up spending about 4 years in prison. I did my time sober, which is not as easy as you might think. Drugs are everywhere inside, often brought by the guards themselves in exchange for cash on the outside. My first cellmate was a leader of the NYC Crips serving 2 life sentences for killing 3 rival gang members. This was not a movie, this was my real life. It sometimes felt surreal, as if I was going to wake up at any moment. I would CONSTANTLY have dreams I was home and this never happened. The line between reality and fiction had never felt so thin.\n* Prison was hard. I didn't know the rules, and being a white suburban kid didn't help. I'll tell one prison story that sums up my time. 9 days into my sentence I am in a 23/1. 23 hours in a cell, 1 hour of recreation. On this day; our cells unlock with the sound of a buzz and lunch begins. Shortly after an inmate stabs another with a melted down fork he had made as a \"shank.\" I am paralysed with fear. Within 60 seconds SWAT team is there. Stepping in sync with loud marching boots, helmets, shields, and German Shepards dogs barking I hear them yelling \"GET THE FUCK ON THE GROUND. DO IT NOW!\" I am so paralysed in fear, I am unable to register that I am the only person standing. At the tug of my heel, my cellmate says \"get down man!\" and I drop. This is my new life.\n* I was lucky (VERY LUCKY) that one of the people I connected with in there was one of the toughest guys who's reputation kept me safe, but also a guy who had experience in recovery. Let's call him Jax.  Jax was kind of a big shot in there.  Not big enough to do whatever he wanted, but important enough every cell block gave respect.  I remember once waking up at 3am to my cell lights coming on and my door being buzzed open.  Over the day room's loud speakers I hear  \"Listen carefully G block, when we call your cell, hands on your head and on your knees.  Don't fucking move until you are handcuffed and led out 1 by 1.\"  I am cuffed and dragged away before I can stand, squinting, still adjusting to the bright lights in my face, I make out almost 30 guards holding SWAT shields and batons staring me down in just my boxers. (cops use intimidation tactics like this often in prison, constantly trying to hold the upper hand in the balance of power)  I am brought to F block and minutes later, so is Jax.  Jax asks an inmate whom I've never seen \"what's going down?\" Guy replies \"someone got stabbed on night detail and they're looking for the weapon.  We could be locked down for hours, what do you need?\"  Jax says \"get me 2 sodas and 2 bags of chips.\"  Not 5 minutes later an inmate passes 2 sodas and 2 bags of chips to Jax.  He hands me 1 of each and says \"it's gonna be a long night, take this.\" (let me pause for a moment and add soda is NOT on the commissary list, meaning you cannot buy this.  You only get soda by having connections)  7 hours go by, the cops can't find the knife and give up.  We return to G block.  I ask Jax \"Hey, who was that guy you knew who hooked us up.\"  He replies, \"not sure, never met him.\" That's what kind of inmate Jax was.\n* Me being a college student offered value to Jax. He was working on an appeal and needed someone smart to help. In exchange for helping him study law, I was transferred to his cell where I earned a free pass in jail and for the most part...everyone left me alone. I even got to workout with the biggest guys who got me in great shape. This is a big honor on the inside.\n* It's now my 3rd year and I remember I once complained about the prison time I got having seen SO MANY violent offenders get a fraction of the time I got.  Jax looked at me pissed off.  I had never seen him look at me that way and I didn't know what kind of prison sin I had committed..or worse, what my punishment was.   Jax looked at me and said words that have stayed with me 15 years later. \"***If this is TRULY going to be the fight that determines what your life will be, why are you so eager to get it over with? Because it hurts? Because it's uncomfortable? Nothing in here or out there is easy. You want to succeed out there? Start in here. Accept what you've done, take the punishment whether it's fair or not, and let it hurt so badly you never make another mistake again.***\" These words are profound and change my life forever. From that moment on I accept my punishment, I accept my situation, and I accept the challenge of finishing my time regardless of length and getting out to do great things!\n* I reconnected with my parents during my 3rd year in prison and ultimately got released to their care a year later. I don't think they ignored me the first 2 years because they were mad at me, I think they felt guilt they couldn't protect me and couldn't bare to visit. My brother mentioned on the phone shortly after I went away that my mom had removed every photo of me in the house. He was upset.  I was not.  I understood...they were in pain.  They were doing time too!\n* My last memory of prison is my parole hearing one month before being released. It takes a long time for the parole board to set up before the proceeding starts: cameras, microphones, reading case files on the spot since I gather they don't prep much before, etc. So it's quiet for a while. Then one board member loudly announces \"sorry for the delay, we are unsure of the victims status and if they are prepared to speak today\". I reply \"I hope it's ok to address the board but I don't think I have a victim, do I?\" It's quiet for another minute, they do not respond to my comment. I hear one board member whisper \"if there's no victim why did this kid get so much time, Jesus.\" That's when I realized the board assumed I had tried to kill someone based on the length of my sentence. I am asked very few questions. They do the talking;\"Mr.Smith (not my real name), you have given a lot of your youth for a punishment we don't quite understand. I see your parents here today who have agreed to take you into care. This board feels you have served time far beyond what fits the crime and to be on the record for transcript, we are a bit disturbed by this case. We move to release you as soon as we can process papers Mr.Smith. The board would release you today if we could. Good luck son.\" I didn't cry when I was sentenced, I didn't cry when my girlfriend broke up with me 14 months later, I didn't even cry when I was told my own mother removed the memory of me. But back in my cell, digesting that even a parole board couldn't believe the unjust punishment I had served, I've never cried harder in my life.\n\n**THE ROAD TO SUCCESS**\n\n* It's now 2007 and I'm home. After years of dreaming of a better life, it's GO TIME.\n* I enroll in college classes a week after my release.\n* I apply to EVERY job I can find. I get denied many times bc of my record, I KEEP APPLYING.\n* Get a job working at the rehab I had gone to during court (which we had hoped would help in sentencing) but I genuinely wanted to get clean when I was there.\n* 2 years after being home, my daily regiment is school, AA meetings, working out, work, repeat.\n* I am taking 18 credits a semester in classes like advanced calculus and anatomy/physiology. I refuse to stop working on myself. I am taking winter classes, summer classes, morning classes, night classes. No vacations, no breaks. I am working 60-70 hours a week for close to minimum wage. I am not dating, I am focused on graduating.\n* And just 3 years after my release in 2010...I graduate Magna Cum Laude at the top of my class with a 3.94 GPA. My whole family is there, it is a day of celebration....a day of progress, something I HAD DREAMED of so many times. But I'm not done.......\n* I start applying to jobs in California where the question \"have you been convicted of a felony\" only applies to 6 years back. (My conviction date is now passed that) BOOM! I get a job at a tech company in SF and now have a 6 figure income. But still...sobriety keeps giving....\n* I get promoted 3 times over the next 5 years and am soon Director of my department. LIFE IS F\\*KING GOLDEN!!!\n* You might be thinking at this point of the story that I'm unique. That maybe \"he's just really smart\" or \"he must have connections\". None of those things are accurate.  **WORK produces RESULTS**. All of us can study and learn and apply. Put in the work and things will come, I promise you the sun and the moon if you follow this strategy!  **If you think you can't...I PROMISE YOU CAN!**\n\n**My relapse / my rebuild**\n\n* I got complacent during COVID. I had just moved to a new city for a new promotion and barely set up before lock down. I thought time was a tool and I'd never relapse. It unfortunately is not. In less than 3 months I went from asking my doctor for pain meds for a tweaked shoulder while lifting to snorting up to 30 fent pills a day. This disease is fierce, cunning, progressive, and as addicts we find ways to rationalise the money, the use, the neglect of others in our life.\n* But I had been sober long enough to recognise where things were going and having had such a low bottom before, I was terrified of such consequences again so I am now 6 days sober having lost nothing but money. (unfortunately a LOT of money, but luckily no other consequences)\n* Having been sober almost 13 years is not \"gone\". It doesn't die just bc I relapsed. Relapse can be a humbling and important part of our journey. For me, it's a reminder to KEEP WORKING! Work on myself: find hobbies I love, people I cherish, and find the strength to explore where I'm hurting and felt the need to medicate.\n* So without further ado, let me share the wisdom that was given to me to help build an amazing life out of an addiction that took me to brink of my sanity and landed me in prison with a decade long sentence.\n\n**HERE ARE 5 STEPS THAT CHANGED MY LIFE AND CAN CHANGE YOURS TO....**\n\n**STEP 1) BEAT WITHDRAWAL**\n\n* It's bad..but not THAT bad. I have a beautiful paramedic ex gf who I contacted last week and told her what was going on and my plan to detox at home. I thought she was going to say \"Oh my God‚Ä¶...fent WD is going to be the hardest thing of your life\". She did NOT. I will quote her...\"You FUCKING pussy! Yes, it will be a struggle but you want to see pain? Watch someone on benzos having a seizure as they bite their tongue off..that's pain! Suck it up, stop using, and in 1week it will be over. Watch some movies you weak bitch!\" She was not entirely wrong. I had bad cramps, I had some very negative thoughts, I had cravings, I could not sleep, I had gut wrenching anxiety...but I DID NOT have a seizure, was not vomiting on the floor, diarrhea was non existent with the help of Imodium. So basically‚Ä¶‚Ä¶it will hurt‚Ä¶but you will beat it.\n\n**STEP 2) GET MOTIVATED**\n\n* So now you're passed detox and feeling good. So good you \"might\" be tempted to use again. Remember your cause! WHY DID YOU JUST GO THROUGH HELL? Find your inspiration and wear it like a shield. Music was my choice for inspiration. But whether it's a book, or songs, or quotes, or people you know...you MUST genuinely want this.  **Recovery is NOT for people who NEED it. It's only for those who WANT it**. So next step in the playbook is strap up and find your inspiration.\n\n**STEP 3) FORGIVE YOURSELF**\n\n* If you've made it this far in the playbook...CONGRATULATIONS. You're feeling healthy, you want change and you're ready to work for it. Kudos my friend! But before all your sober dreams come true and you're living the high life, there's someone lurking who wants you to fail. It's YOUR GUILT. YOU WILL feel guilt and shame...it will pass. Beating yourself up will lead to relapse. FORGIVE YOURSELF for the mistakes you've made. It's in the past. You can't change it, move on. You will want to self loathe..you will want to be mad at yourself..that is your disease telling you that you're not strong enough. I don't care what you did in addiction or the issues you caused, you need to let that shit go NOW AND MOVE FORWARD. The gift of sobriety allows for amends. Amends are not \"sorries\" where we hope the person forgives us. Amend means \"to change.\" 99% of my amends were changing my life for the better and people around me being proud. The point of recovery is to open a new chapter of your life and YOU WILL be a different person. One life can be made up of many different story lines so let your past shame/guilt go! Staying sober is a war that can be won. But not if your general is berating the troops calling them all shitty people and putting them down. Put your arms around your soldiers (yourself in this analogy) and say....I'm sorry I haven't been the general you all needed, I'm sorry I let you down. But not today. TODAY‚Ä¶you get a pissed off general who is going to destroy the opponent. and when we go to war, there will be victory. So get your helmets on and strap up..it's a new day soldiers!\n\n**STEP 4) FIX YOURSELF**\n\n* To make it here, you've had to endure pain and make amends with yourself. I'm impressed friend, few make it this far! You're now ready to patch the hole. Facing ourselves and asking tough questions (wether with a therapist, in AA/NA, or self led can be really scary and uncomfortable.) BUT FEAR IS ONLY SCARY WHEN YOU REFUSE TO LOOK IT IN THE EYE. The basis of our identity during addiction is FEAR. It convinced me, to my core, as real as something I could touch that I was not strong enough to do this. I've heard it said \"the best things in life are on the other side of fear\". We all medicate to cover feelings of \"X\". And there lies the treasure box. You MUST find what is missing in your life, your \"X\" and change it. For me, I was masking loneliness this time around with COVID and being isolated. It starts with myself; I need a new hobby and to make better use of my time to avoid sitting around. Work out more, hike more, join more events, etc. I now also need to force myself to connect with others more. Call my family more, make an effort to make new friends, put more effort into meaningful dating. FIND YOUR X and fix it before you need to medicate it. But your destiny of endless sobriety doesn't end here, there is still one more step you must follow.\n\n**STEP 5) DON'T GET COMPLACENT**\n\n* Let's recap: You've sobered up, found the motivation to stay clean, looked inward and healed the pain that triggered you to use?!...well..done! But heed this warning or pay a price. Time is NOT a tool to stay clean. Somebody with 15 years of sobriety is no better or worse than someone with 6 days like myself. We all have the same 24 hours in the day and how we use them determines the QUALITY of our life, the strength of our sobriety. SO don't get lazy when things get good. I paid that price myself. Stay hungry, stay committed, and ENJOY the amazing life that you WILL build. I was told my life would change 15 years ago in rehab if I got sober and I laughed. No way did I think a totally different life could be made when facing the harshest of situations. YET HERE I STAND. (more like sit because I'm still tired from WD but you get my point).\n\nI hope my story or these steps help just one person on their journey! AMA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**BONUS CHAPTER**: Someone asked if I am dating and then someone else suggested I add this part of my story\n\n* My love life? That's quite the story too! Before I went away I had a love few people get to experience. Our souls were on FIRE for each other. We had dated for 3 years before I was sentenced. She was beautiful. Smart. A dancer (part time NBA Cheerleader). She was funny. Kind. A great cook. At times a brat. lol. I loved her with everything inside of me. But we were young, she was devastated when I left, and ultimately she started dating one of my best friends 14 months into my sentence.. I was heart broken when I found out...the ONLY fight I ever had in prison was less than 3 hours after I got the news. When I got out she was the first to reach out. She was dating someone else at the time, but I could tell she was torn on trying to make \"us\" work again. I didn't let her make the decision I knew she wanted to. I stayed away as much as I could even though she tried to get close to me again. She truly was SUCH a big supporter of mine. She never stopped caring. But I had so much guilt for being gone and everyone else I knew had moved on with their life. Graduated, got real jobs, married people, had kids. I needed to make my own hustle moves, and on top of that I was on parole for Christ's sake! I felt like her parents hated me and that I no longer deserved her.\n* So...I started to date someone else about 1 year after I got released, she was blonde and preppy. My ex HATED her. She would text me and say \"why HER? You can do so much better!\" lol. I liked this girl, I **REALLY** liked this girl. She was the kind of goofy that made you smile just looking at her.  Because you just knew, she was seconds away from breaking out into a dance or busting out a witty joke.  Once we were at a party in NYC where 2 guys tried to tease her for being \"too blonde and preppy\".  An EMINEM  song was playing on the radio.  She looked them dead in the eyes, put a finger to her lips to gesture them to stop talking, turned up the radio...and rapped every...single....line without missing a lyric.  People EXPOLODED with cheer and the 2 guys started clapping.  That's just who she was, the life of the party.\n* I knew she had an eating disorder at the time. She was thin. Not \"scary\" thin, no one else could tell...but we would talk about it often. I'd tell her how perfect I thought her body was. How she drove me crazy in bed! But just like addiction, we can't cure other people. About a year before I graduated college I got the call she had died in her sleep at the age of 24. The anorexia had stripped away enough fat from her heart that it stopped beating in the still of night. The funeral was brutal. Her mother was a mess, her sister inconsolable.\n* About a week later my ex (the first one in this story) drove to my work. It was a scene out of movie. I saw her car pull up from the office window so I went outside to see what she was doing there. She was crying. She didn't know my ex very well...she was crying for me. She asked me if she could hug me and I nodded. I didn't say a word and we hugged for what felt like an hour. She was sobbing hard and shaking and I just held her. I knew she wasn't just crying for the death of my girlfriend. She was, but she was also crying for us. The love, the pain, the anger, the sadness. Beyond it all, she still cared so much that she wanted to heal my pain, even if for another woman. THAT is love!\n* I didn't date for a while after that. I pretty much didn't talk to anyone after my girlfriend died. I worked hard, saved, graduated and moved to California to change my life and get away from it all. I've dated girls over the past 7 years but it just hasn't happened for me again. I guess despite all the great things I've accomplished, the ONE thing I seem to continually fail at over and over and over again is letting someone get close.\n* So yes....I'm on Hinge, and have had a few flings here and there but haven't been in a real relationship since my ex died. I hope I find a girlfriend before I get old. lol I've put in a lot of work into myself and I'm ready for that next step...God knows how badly I'd love to find a partner to take traveling with me! I'm a travel whore. Who knows...maybe 2022 will bring better luck there :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* PS. As a fun finale. About 7 months ago I get an instagram message from my ex. \"I know we haven't spoke in 5 years, and I'm living with my boyfriend now. But do you ever think about us? Do you ever wonder what would have happened if we met at a different point in our lives?\" The answer...of course I do. The reality...we are not the same people as we were back then but I wish her the best.",

    "selftext": "If we were to zero in on different opioid addiction treatment methods used around the world, the most effective would be Diamorphine Replacement Therapy, which has been practiced in Switzerland for 22 years, and ended their opioid epidemic. Diamorphine replacement therapy was recently approved in Canada as well as the UK. Trials of Diamorphine Replacement Therapy are set to begin in California shortly. Given the success rates of Diamorphine Replacement, it should have been adopted in the United States two decades ago. If we took advantage of Diamorphine Replacement Therapy, the drug war would end and Fentanyl overdoses would end. All of this has already happened in Switzerland.\n\nThe reason why our drug epidemic is so bad is because our \"solution\" to the issue is a multi billion dollar addiction industry that uses a 12 Step Model as their answer to everything. The only problem is that the 12 Step Program was modeled by a doctor 95 years ago and was written for alcoholics, not opioid addicted individuals. It is claimed that 12 Step Programs will work for anyone and everyone who suffers from addiction, but the sky-high failure rates prove otherwise.\n\nIf the United States REALLY wants to stop Fentanyl deaths, they would do what Switzerland did to end their drug epidemic. But the US hasn't done that because the drug war keeps DEA agents employed and keeps billions of dollars flowing through the private sector. Billions of dollars used by desperate addicts who want to get sober. Billions of dollars used on failed methods over and over again.",

    "selftext": "waking up from an overdose on my kitchen floor-with cops standing over me, surrounded by paramedics kneeling at my side-my face covered in blood and all I hear is my non addict fianc√© crying hysterically asking the first responders if I was going to make it.\n\nThe rest is mostly a blur due to the concussion,confusion, the bizarre state of mind I was in considering I had just overdosed for the first time. But I will never forget what the paramedic said to me next, ‚ÄúHey brother, someone or something must want you on this earth still, cuz your lips and face were blue and purple and you were dead, but your angel of a fianc√© proceeded to hit you up with narcan until we arrived. You would be dead if it weren‚Äôt for her.‚Äù\n\nNo words were able to form in my mouth. I just broke down emotionally and mentally. At 33 yrs old and after 17 yrs of struggling with addiction-getting clean for multiple years and relapsing-over and over and OVER...and surviving through that cycle for so long, I had finally overdosed. I had raised the white flag of surrender before sooooo many times but this one felt different on so many levels. There is no doubt that i will be dead very soon if I continue this cycle-and I want so much more for my life.\n\nThe paramedics proceeded to ask me their standard questions which seemed so difficult to answer due to the shock and awe moment of things. As they strapped me to the stretcher and hauled me off to the ambulance, I started thinking and asking myself how the fuck this happened. How quickly I pissed 6 months of clean time away (for the 15th time)But most of all, I couldn‚Äôt believe how selfish I had been. I put the love of my life through such a traumatic experience because I made the decision to use one more time. My decision to use gave her a traumatic experience she will never ever forget. will she always be paranoid that this is going to happen in the future? Will this forever change our relationship and the way she views me? Only time will tell. \n\nI arrive at the ER and due to covid protocol none of my family or my fianc√© can see me. Besides the cat scan for my head injury and the occasional nurse check in to make sure I am still breathing, I‚Äôm left alone at 3am in a hospital bed.  Just me and my thoughts and my disease of addiction. I knew I needed help and thank god I had been in recovery before so I knew who to call. \n\nSeveral hours later I was cleared to go home and I made an appointment with my addiction doctor for that day. I took the first step in getting my life back.  \n\nIt has now been 4 days since my overdose and I am now seeing life through a different lens. I‚Äôm so grateful for my loved ones and that I am being given another opportunity at life. \n\nCurrently I‚Äôm on subutex for a rapid 2 week taper and then the goal is to get back on my Vivitrol shot as fast as possible by using the naltrexone challenge. \n\nI know there will be plenty of ups and downs in recovery and in life in general, but one thing I realized is that I never have to walk through anything alone. And that‚Äôs what matters most. As long as we all have our loved ones to help, communicate, walk through something with, it is possible.\n\n*I love each and every one of you on this subreddit. This is an amazing community and it amazes me how much we are able to help one another. Because so many of the posts on here have helped me in a variety of ways, I wanted to write this post in hopes that it helps or contributes to saving a life of a struggling addict* \n\nThank you to anyone who took the time to read my post ü§ôüôè",

The fact that doctors were also handing them out like candy at the time didn‚Äôt help, if you went into see the doctor for an issue as simple as a sore muscle, tooth ache, just very ordinary ailments that did not require opiates made me wonder why doctors were so generous in prescribing these medications that lead your mind and soul to the gates of hell. Many times while in withdrawal I would beg for a spiritual enlightenment, it was like my being was screaming for my soul back. I felt like I was in a spiritual battle without a proper defence, I had no spirit and was therefore doomed to fail. At the moments of withdrawal I always wondered if I was the only one having these spiritual cravings, but if you think about it going through withdrawals you are absolutely reminded of how vile and horrible this experience called life can be and are therefore more likely to forsake any notion of there being a higher power of any kind whatsoever. Not only that but there was times when I was trying to get clean and I had a friend come see me who was going through withdrawals I just got this insanely bad vibe from him or something to the point where being around my bro made me nauseous and genuinely scared. Now my friend is not a violent or dangerous person and I was healthier and stronger so it wasn‚Äôt a physical fear it was honestly a spiritual fear or something. I read the title of this post somewhere and it was like a lightbulb going off in my head finally realizing that I wasn‚Äôt the only one who felt this. I‚Äôm not scared of being ridiculed for this post but this is absolutely true, opiate addiction is without a doubt a war on our spiritual being.",

And let me tell you, **it does get better.** When I look back to when I had 1 or 2 days it was fucking awful. I was obsessive over drugs. All-day the thoughts in my mind. I went through PAWS during this stint of sobriety. But I **made it through.** I have not touched a drug or drink in 30 fucking days. That's fucking insane to me. I've had many small victories. I gave my mom the shit I was selling so I wouldn't be able to get high when I wanted to. I looked at my mom's wallet and decided to **not take money, a thing I had never done before.** My life is truly changing. One fucking day at a time.

    "selftext": "Most often, we seek to use drugs for one reason, to get high. Because getting high means that we are above our reality and experience it from what we perceive as a better point of view. Drugs will often do that. Mask the reality with some vision that we hold of the world and of ourselves. But my discovery lead me down a different route. How can we experience highs when we don‚Äôt experience lows? I had to ponder it myself because it is a hard question for an addict to face. What lows? The only time I experienced low was when I wasn‚Äôt getting drugs. And this was quite low, so my perception of low was quite skewed as well. To me, low meant that there was no way up. Low was somewhere I did not even want to be, because I knew that low meant that I wasn‚Äôt high anymore. But the more I went to those highs, to keep me from being at the bottom, the closer I felt to the bottom when I wasn‚Äôt using. As I sunk lower and lower, I finally realized that the drugs weren‚Äôt helping me achieve what I really needed. Our world is certainly non-binary. There isn‚Äôt just low and high, but a million in between. We must embrace every part of this life and realize that there won‚Äôt be ‚Äúhighs‚Äù in our life, without ‚Äúlows.‚Äù As a matter of fact, the ‚Äúlow‚Äù points in our life are the things that are meant to make the ‚Äúhighs‚Äù even greater. And when I was using, all the million things in between became irrelevant so I only ever experienced high or low. If I don‚Äôt allow myself to feel everything and deal with it then it‚Äôs not going to work. \n\nThanks for reading, \n\nCody",

    "title": "The best post on tapering opioids I have ever seen. Can potentially save people a lot of pain.",
    "selftext": "I have been in the game a long time, and have heard all sorts of opinions about tapering off opioids. My best friend, who just got her md last year, told me that they are taught in medical school that you can taper off opioids but you are going to have a painful kick at the end, no matter how you do it. This did not jive with another friend's opinion, who is a nurse practitioner and spends a lot of time weaning infants off of opiates.\n\nLast year I tried tapering off a gram a day of potent heroin and ended up going cold turkey because tapering simply did not seem to work. I now know I was rushing it, way too fast. In any event, below is a post made by a doctor that treats addiction and manages narcotic withdrawals. It is the best I have ever seen and was contributed by u/vbwrg. The original discussion involved the use of 150 10 mg. norcos but it applies across the spectrum.\n\n\"So, tapering using short-acting full agonists is possible (at least if the person is taking them orally), but it's not the easiest way to quit and it takes either a lot of discipline or help from someone else.\n\nThe idea behind tapering is to bring the dose down gradually enough that frank withdrawal is suppressed. You don't have a ton of Norco to work with, so your taper will be quick by necessity. A quick taper is OK with short-acting opioids (I've tapered people in 7-10 days in the hospital plenty of times) - the risk, especially when there's a history of addiction, is that the person doesn't stick to the taper and/or that they relapse on some other substance. People often think that it's only withdrawal that keeps them in the addictive cycle, but then when they're on a controlled taper or MAT, many find that their psychological dependence goes deeper than their physical dependence - that even when they have no withdrawal symptoms at all, their cravings don't automatically disappear. With a quick taper, there may be *some* withdrawal symptoms, but they will be far milder than with a cold-turkey detox.\n\nThis is why it takes either extreme discipline (which can sometimes appear when a person is *done* with opioids and when their desire for abstinence is really high) or help from someone else. If you have anyone else who could hold your Norco and dispense them as required by the taper plan, that will probably increase your chances of success. If you don't have anyone who could do that but you *do* have money, you could check and see if any of the timed medication safes or dispensers can be programmed in a way that a taper could be completed. I haven't dug into that question, but a dispenser that can only dispense pills by the same dosing schedule every day won't help you.\n\nThe conversion is a little tough when a person is using oxycodone intranasally. We don't really know what the average bioavailability is for IN oxycodone b/c there are only a few small studies that got different results. There may be inter-individual or inter-product variability, too. Since oxycodone already has high oral BA, and IN BA seems to vary from \"much lower than oral\" to \"slightly higher than oral, unless *you* can say \"it takes X amount of oral hydrocodone for me to get the same effect as 30mg IN oxycodone\" we're all guessing here a bit.\n\nSince you're maxed out at 4g/day of Tylenol anyway (which is about 12 Norco), that's the place to start. It's also only a slight drop from my estimated conversion of your daily MME, which is about where you want to be.\n\nAnother option might be to maintain while your family is visiting (you don't say how long they'll be there) then detox when they're gone. But I think having your family there to occupy you might help you through this taper.\n\nWhen a person is tapering, the goal is to reduce, as much as possible, the spikes and dips in opioid tone in their brain. The easy way to do this is to use something long-acting that maintains even blood levels. The harder way is to dose a short-acting opioid frequently enough that the peaks and troughs are leveled out. Norco usually doesn't last much longer than 4 hours in most people, so unless you get a longer effect, I wouldn't stretch it out much past that. You tell me how long it takes after a Norco for you to start craving, and I might adjust this somewhat. You have enough Norco to do a slower taper if you'd like, and you have the education to do the arithmetic to figure it out, so this is just a sample starting place:\n\nDay 1: 12 Norco = either 1 Norco q2h (smoothest but least convenient), 1.5 Norco q3h or 2 Norco q4h.\n\nDay 2: 9 Norco = either .75 Norco q2h, or 1.5 Norco every q4h\n\nDay 3: 8 Norco = 1 Norco q3h\n\nDay 4: 6 Norco = 1/2 Norco q2h, 0.75 Norco q3h, or 1 Norco q4h\n\n(from here, I'd probably start using volumetric dosing where the fractions require it. Given your education, I'm sure you know all about that!)\n\nDay 5: 5 Norco - 5/6 Norco q4h, or 5/8 Norco q3h, or 5/12 Norco q2h\n\nDay 6: 4 Norco - 1/2 Norco q3h is easiest\n\nDay 7: 3 Norco - 1/4 Norco q2h, 3/8 Norco q3h, or 1/2 Norco q4h\n\nDay 8: 2.4 Norco - 1/5 Norco q2h, 3/10 Norco q3h, or 2/5 Norco q4h\n\n(you can work out the rest from here - just keep reducing by 10-25% per day, depending how you tolerate it, don't spread the dosing intervals too far, and get as low as you can before jumping off).\n\nGive the taper a try, but there's a decent chance you'll need some form of MAT. Your options are a Vivitrol shot (if you can get 7 days opioid-free) or bupe. You'll hear a lot of mixed opinions on bupe on these forums, but my experience has been that people like you (oral/nasal abusers of pharmaceuticals, with a relatively small tolerance, with financial and family support to really get their lives together) often do *really really well on bupe.* If this taper doesn't work out, please look into either detox then Vivitrol or bupe.\n\nIf you have *any* plans to try to get back into pharmacy, I'd say a blocking form of MAT is a necessity.\n\nBesides possibly MAT, the main thing you're going to need to get off the addiction track is *something productive to occupy your time.* You're 30, and it's true your 20s are gone - but 30 is still young, and NOT too late to turn things around. It's much easier to get your life re-started at 30 than at 40. If you aren't occupied for a good portion of your day, then the boredom, free time, and crippling guilt will consume you and drive you right back to pills. It sounds like you've used opioids to blot out your shame and disappointment over being kicked out of your pharmd program. When the opioids are gone, those feelings will come back full-force, along with all the shame/guilt/disappointment over wasting your 20s, freeloading off your family, being addicted, etc.\n\nYou've already got one good outlet for that: exercise. Exercise is great for anyone coming off opioids. It gets the endorphins flowing and provides an outlet for the sympathetic overactivation you'll experience coming off opioids (clonidine helps with that too, if exercise isn't enough). Just keep an eye out that you aren't getting dehydrated. But you can't spend your entire day exercising.\n\nIt's time to decide what would make you happy - whether you'd rather build a career on your background in bio/pharmacy, or whether you'd rather do something fitness related. Sounds like the latter is your true passion, but I don't really know. Your family is doing fine running their business - I think they'd rather you do what makes you happy than work for the family business out of a misplaced sense of guilt. If you actually really *love* bio/pharm, that's a different story - but it sounds like you don't love it the way you love fitness.\n\nOnce you decide that, you find whatever job, internship, or degree program you can get. The hard part for someone like you is usually just accepting that you can't jump your way to a position commensurate with your intelligence and potential when you have a 10-year resume gap. You need to take *any* position you can get in your chosen field and *prove* that you're a good employee. Nobody may doubt your talent, but they'll still doubt that you'll have the ability to show up, do what you're told, get along with others, accept direction, etc. You're lucky in that you don't really *need* to support yourself immediately. If you can't get a paying job, get an unpaid internship or even just start volunteering. You won't make money but you'll start building your resume, getting references, and proving your value.\n\nYou're really not alone here. I've treated plenty of addicted children from highly educated, upper-middle-class, supportive families. Can't tell you how many times I've heard, \"I wish I came from a bad family so I wouldn't feel so guilty!\" The best way to leave your guilt behind is to move forward with your life and become a man that you and your family can be proud of. I have kids and grandkids - if they're doing well in the present, I don't give a fuck what anxiety or worry or heartache they caused me in the past. All that matters is that they pulled through and they're ok NOW.\"",

    "selftext": "Hello all, \n The purpose for this post is to show that there is one less opiate addict in the world now and that it is possible to get clean and stay clean. \n\nI know how hard it is. Looking back, the times when I was withdrawling in that vicious cycle were the absolute lowest point of my life thus far. Ive never seriously considered suicide until I was curled up in a fetal position on my floor, begging to the walls to give me some sort of miraculous relief. \n\nI cannot claim to be addiction free, just oxycontin free. I used loperamide(immodium) to get off of blues. Now I do not reccomend this as its just replacing one addiction for another, lope is just as addictive and can have very negative health effects including death. I personally started with 30 pills every morning, over the course of a year pushed it to 80, and then, after meeting my current boyfriend (who steamrolled me to get clean) I have tapered until this current day when I took 7 along with 2gs of kratom(kratom use started about 2 weeks ago as the lope withdrawals were hurting pretty bad). If my plan continues, I will be 100% off of lope and kratom by Christmas.\nWhich is an excellent present for myself.\n\nIm a 25 year old woman, my addiction started in 2012 and lasted 3 years. Snorting was my method but I did try injecting twice(very faint veins-it did not work thankfully). I went from being a happy well adjusted girl to selling my body to a gross 70 year old man for 60 bucks(no intercourse, he got to touch my breasts and ass while I cleaned his house naked) and lying to my entire family while destroying those relationships that meant so much to me. I dislocated my own finger so I could go to the hospital and score pills. \n\nPoint is, I did some shit that I remember with red-faced shame. And im sure some of you have too. However the past is the past, you may be at rock bottom today but tomorrow is always going to be there, and you must choose whether to be strong enough to proceed into darkness willingly or cling to your safe spot that will ulitimatly lead you somewhere much darker than you are facing today. \n\nI did it (with crutches). Ive been free of hard opiates for two years. Ive also always considered myself as weak willed. If I can do this, you can too.\n\nIf anyone wants to hear specifics or needs someone to talk to: please pm me. I want to be of help in any way I can. My advice here is to try kratom. Its not 100% safe and can be addictive..but out of the options it is the best. Always do your research first. Good luck and positive thoughts for anyone attempting sobriety!",

    "title": "My Life Was Hopeless. 22 Years of Heroin Addiction. Now?",
    "selftext": "I am writing this for a couple of reasons. I want to share my story with others who may be feeling as hopeless as I was a few weeks ago. I also want to just get it out of my mind and into writing.\n\nI became a heroin addict at the age of 14. I stupidly THOUGHT I was in love with a man who was aged 24. He was a heroin addict. To my dismay at that time, he didn't mind I was only a 14 year old child. I just thought I was so grown up that he actually loved me. I now know he was a pedophile and he raped and abused me. Oh, and got me hooked on heroin. \n\nIt began with me nagging him to try it. It didn't take much nagging. He gave me some to smoke one day. Then the next day. And the next. Then he decided it would be better for us to inject it as it saved money etc. I agreed reluctantly. I couldn't (still can not) inject myself. He would do this for me. He would often inject me with blunt needles. Caused abscesses and lumps and infections all over my 15 year old arms. I would BEG to just allow me to smoke my half. He would not allow it \n\nThis went on until he would go to prison. Then I would cold turkey. I would be clean for the months he was in prison. I was lucky. I had good friends who welcomed me back into the group. I even had a good best mate who saw me through every detox. Anyway, then the nonse would come out of prison and I would be back on the heroin within a week. I tried many times to kill myself and almost succeeded twice. I would self harm. Not one doctor, police person or parent ever stopped this. I find that really hurtful. They all knew. The police knew as they would always see me with the pedophile, me looking thin and sickly. I would be there when they would arrest him. In the police station, I blew kisses to him in his cell in front of them, as he mouthed \"I love you\" through the little cell window. I told the hospital doctors and nurses why I tried to kill myself. It was over him and something he had done. They knew I was a 15 year old H addict as they treated me for my overdoses and detoxed me off heroin in hospital. And of course both my parents knew. My mother banned him from the house. She recently told me she DID phone the police several times to tell them about all this ..but they did nothing. This cycle went on for years. Until I was 18.\n\nWhen I was 18, I met my husband. He was an ex heroin addict. He weaned me off heroin with Subutex that he was prescribed. He saved my life.\n\nSadly, two young junkies together sometimes doesn't exactly make a good recipe for staying clean. We both began using heroin together. Only ever smoked it though. I have not injected once since I finally left that pervert. But still... Smoking heroin isn't great is it?\n\nSo, my husband and I would have stints of being sober and then would relapse. This went on for 17 years.\n\nThis brings us to the present time.\n\nI could not take anymore. About six months ago I finally reached out to professionals. I contacted my local clinic for help. I threw myself at their mercy.\n\nThe treatment took three months to begin. Those months were dark. I confess, I wanted to die everyday.\n\nTreatment consisted of me visiting the local pharmacy/chemist each day. I would be given two 8mg buprenorphine pills. The pharmacist would observe me taking them with eagle eyes. Eyes that I felt were judging. That may or may not be true. But my mental health was so very poor then that I couldn't tell which way was up!\n\nThis clearly wasn't working for me. The pills? They were great! It was this daily visit to the chemist and this observation every single day that was making me worse than before!\n\nI have to attend an appointment once a month at the clinic to monitor my progress. At each appointment I would cry and beg for the buvidal injection. I had heard ONLY good things about it. For those who do not know what it is, it's an injection once a month of buprenorphine that's slow release. You just have the injection. Have no withdrawals and get on with your life.\n\nI was told no so many times. I was told it's impossible. They no longer give them out. The funding and availability is not there and so on.\n\nAbout three weeks ago I finally got rock bottom. I wasn't going daily to the chemist. I was still using heroin. And I was still feeling like I wanted to die.\n\nI went to my usual monthly appointment and I just broke down. I told my key worker that it's not working for me. I'll never be free. My life has been hell for 22 years and it won't stop. I don't want to die .. I just want the pain to stop. I took out my phone and said to my key worker \"I've heard of this buvidal injection\". She interrupted me and said \"oh I know what that is. Let me get the doctor\". The next bit happened so fast! The doctor came in, she said \"you MUST go to the chemist every single day for a whole week. Then, you come here on day seven and we give you a week's worth or the buvidal injection. Then a week later we'll give you the monthly buvidal injection\". Just like that! \n\nI was amazed! I thought it was \"impossible\" and there was \"no accessibility\" etc? Anyway! Never mind that! I'm finally getting it I thought.\n\nI DRAGGED myself to that pharmacy each day for seven days. And I mean drag lol. One day I was forced to walk about five miles. But I did it. Because I knew this was my LAST chance for hope and change.\n\nSo... I did it. I got the weekly injection about three weeks ago. I admit, the first week wasn't perfect. But OMG! What a difference! No more waking up sick wanting to die. My mood was just lifted. I felt as though I had been living underneath a blanket made of black velvet crafted by the devil himself for 22 years. But now this blanket had been lifted off me!\n\nI went two weeks ago for my second injection. This one lasts a month. The doctor even said if I feel withdrawals after three weeks I can go for a top up. So I have security. And NO MORE CHEMIST TRIPS!\n\nThe only problem I have now is my husband is getting his help. His first appointment is tomorrow! \n\nIt's time to get my life back. If you read all that thank you. And if you're suffering right now, there's an answer out there somewhere for you too. I found my answer by asking loads of questions. Asking for other's experiences. Researching everything I could get my hands on. There IS an answer. There IS hope. It's really, really difficult to see this when you're in the throes of addiction. But you must fight! You can be well again. You can have a life. You are worthy and you're worth saving.\n\nThanks to the people here who helped me. You know who you are.",

I was clean after 2 weeks and stayed like that for only 4 days before relapsing.\n\nI told my father about my addiction. Then I told my mother. About 7 months ago I started taking Suboxone. It was a series of relapse after relapse every single week. My urine was never clean. I lied constantly and was in withdrawal more often than not. I lost a ton of weight and eventually ended up homeless. Luckily, I still had my girlfriend.\n\nOn November 20th, my girlfriend took this picture while I was living inside her dorm . I was still an active user.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/vaPF01e\n\n2 days later, November 22nd, I started methadone.

    "title": "As a long term methadone abuser I‚Äôm 90 days clean today and I just want everyone to know you‚Äôre gonna make it",
    "selftext": "I have kind of a unique path here nd I thought I‚Äôd just share my perspective as an 8 year long time methadone abuser \n\nI was diagnosed with a tumor when I was 21 in 2014 in my mesentery, which is basically the nexus of the entire GI blood supply, making the tumor completely inoperable. To make a very long story short, the most effective way they have to control the tumor and stop it from getting larger is to stun it with a 6-8 month long round of pretty intense chemotherapy. \n\nSo I‚Äôve been on chemo. A lot. Yes it sucks. There were definitely times when I was legitimately in pain. For sure. The tumor being right in the center of my GI tract meant it was growing into my small intestine, constricting it to the point where I could not eat. For 3 years. I had 1‚Äô6‚Äù feeding tube sticking out of my abdomen. It was considered too radical to stent it at the time, which is where they put a really complicated metal spring inside your intestine to hold it open against the tumor. So I didn‚Äôt eat. actually I lost 120 lbs and went from being severely obese to being at the ideal BMI for my height and that was a hugeeeee plus but that‚Äôs another story.\n\nBut anyways, it only took that first hospital stay for me to find out these painkillers they were giving me felt good and I wanted more of them, and I also learned that if you have a tumor and say you are in pain, doctors will take that at face value. I quickly blew through prescriptions, made new appointments, got my doses raised and did it all again. I would try and take my prescriptions in any way you could imagine, but after going through dozens of opioids and deciding which ones were my favorite (by far(old)opana, oxy, dilaudid nd methadone) I eventually found myself with a prescription for methadone. \n\nI got most of my prescriptions in liquid form because of my stomach issues, and it didn‚Äôt take long for me to figure out I was getting vials of pure methadone in liquid suspension which was qualified for IV use. I still remember the first time I put 2 and 2 together, sitting in a hospital because I couldn‚Äôt eat (again). Knowing the nurses cart is sitting out in the hallway unseen by anyone at 2AM. Stealing a syringe. Finding the bottle I had stowed away from home to supplement the doses they were giving me at the hospital. \n\nA lot of you are probably familiar with methadone by mouth,  but methadone str8 to the brain hits just as good, if not better than fent, dilaudid, morphine, anything. And lasts a damn long time too. But as any needle user knows once you cross that path, you can‚Äôt go back. It stops being about the high but about the rush. Soon I was shooting it up every chance I got. At the end, I was going through 4000mg of methadone and 2000mg of oxy in 3 week prescriptions. My life was falling apart around me but damn did I feel great.\n\nAnd it always does fall apart. \n\nCatastrophically. \n\nI blew through my whole prescription in a week. Over Christmas. \n\nThere was no doctor to save me this time. \n\nWith family at our house I completely fell apart into the worst state of withdrawal that you could even imagine. The problem that had been so obvious to everyone around me for so long couldn‚Äôt be ignored any longer. My family forced me to do the one thing I had always avoided to do at any cost. Tell the doctors the truth.\n\nLike I said. There definitely were times I was in unbearable pain. But the truth was, when the tumor was in remission, stunned by the chemo, I rarely noticed it was there. My eating issues were largely resolved at this point by unrelated surgery. When the tumor was sleeping, I lied about being in pain to feed this addiction and its unrelenting tolerance.\n\nIf anyone is ever scared about coming clean to medical professionals about your struggles I hope this part will help you.\n\nThe doctors were totally understanding, and took me in to the hospital to detox. They were professional pain doctors in a cancer hospital, they put people on painkillers who die on painkillers. In other words, they didn‚Äôt know a lot about taking people off painkillers. \n\nBut it was a big hospital, with therapists and psychiatrists on staff to help figure this out and get me off these meds. They were supportive of my achievements, listened to all my suggestions about which medications help with withdrawal (Valium, Clonidine, Doxepin, Pregabalin, Ambien and loperamide), and in less than 4 months I tapered from the staggering doses I was taking before to being opioid free for the first time in 8 years as of March 29th, 2023.\n\nI went to rehab for the first time in my life. I truly lucked out on this front, but the place I went to was the most supportive, caring, and healing environment I had ever been to. I figured out what made me start using in the first place (depression/anxiety over my illness) and what I can do to tackle the demons that made my real life so unbearable that all I wanted to do was escape into a warm opioid haze for the rest of my life. My life is moving in a positive direction for the first time in 8 years, and I‚Äôm reconnecting with all the things that I loved doing before I let painkillers consume my life.\n\nI know that there‚Äôs tons of bad rehabs out there and it sickens me to see how the industry has turned into a way to abuse addicts through their insurance companies. But there are good ones too, and I think that really finding the right place can make or break a recovery. \n\nBut I know now that I am on the right path, and I‚Äôm putting my life back together. \n\nToday it‚Äôs been 90 days. \n\nMaybe it‚Äôs too early for me to say that I‚Äôll never relapse. Maybe the tumor starts growing and the pain comes back again. But I know I‚Äôll try my hardest. I‚Äôm proud to say I‚Äôm proud that I‚Äôm 90 days sober today for the first time in my adult life. \n\nI‚Äôm sorry for the long post, I just wanted to spread some positivity because for the first time in a very long time, I feel positive about myself.",

    "title": "The Science Behind Rapid Micro-Induction of Buprenorphine (Suboxone) for Fentanyl Users: An Update on the Bernese Method. A guide backed by scientific articles for anyone trying to get off of fentanyl by getting on suboxone.",
    "selftext": " I posted this on r/fentanyl but figured more people who are interested in quitting would see it here. \n\nSo there seems to be quite a bit of confusion on this sub about micro-induction of buprenorphine, frequently referred to as the Bernese method of induction. How much sub to take? When to take it? How much fent to use? Does it have to be powder or pills? There seems to be quite a bit of ambiguity to the doses and schedule. The range of answers given by users on this sub is likely due to there not being just one correct way. Micro-induction of buprenorphine can be done a variety of ways. I have a B.S. in Pharmacology and used my knowledge to help get me off of fent, so I figured I should share what I know. I wrote this guide a few months back and thought I'd clean it up a bit and re-post it for anyone looking for a way to get off of fent and onto suboxone. I even added a google spreadsheet so people can follow a suggested schedule and plug in their dates, times, quantity used, and SOWS number. I'm really busy with work before I start medical school in the fall, but I will try to answer questions whenever I can. [Fuck Fentanyl.](https://ih1.redbubble.net/image.3371596429.8704/st,small,507x507-pad,600x600,f8f8f8.jpg)\n\n**Standard Induction**\n\nThe standard induction is what we have all originally knew about suboxone, wait until you are so sick you can't take it anymore and then take the sub. With real heroin or oxycodone this was much simpler. Wait 12-24 hours until you've got watery eyes and stomach problems and you were good to go; 8mg and 30 min later and you were on the other side. The American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) suggests that the person must be at least at a 12 on the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) before taking the suboxone. With fentanyl being mixed into every street opioid from heroin to \"30s/blues/percs\" pills, it is getting harder to make the transition to bupe using the standard induction. This is due to fentanyl and it's analogs being fat soluble and lingering in adipose tissue (fat) in the body for days or even weeks after last use. This is especially true for heavy, habitual users. Taking bupe too early will take someone experiencing mild withdrawal symptoms to severe withdrawal symptoms in under an hour. This is known as precipitated withdrawal (PWD.) The magic number normally given here is 72 hours, but can vary with users reporting no PWD after 48 hours to severe PWD after 80 hours of abstinence. Beside the mental craving to taking an opioid, having to sit in mild to moderate withdrawal for several days until an 11 on the COWS is reached has proven too difficult for many. Thankfully, there are other ways.\n\n**The Bernese Method**\n\nThis seems to be the most commonly referred to method on this sub for micro-dosing induction. [First done in Switzerland and published in German in 2010](https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/s-0030-1261914), they successfully transitioned a female heroin user who had difficulty with the standard induction. They first gave the user 0.2mg of bupe while she continued her regular use of heroin. Over several days, the bupe was increased so that by the 6th day, she was taking 8mg per day and no longer required heroin. The study reports that \"only minor stress and distress\" occurred for the patient. This is the only study that I will reference where I was only able to read the abstract and not the full paper due to a paywall. All other studies I will mention were available for free, primarily on pubmed central (PMC). The original study did not get much attention from others in the addictive medicine field. At the time, pill mill clinics were prescribing massive amounts of opiates from hydrocodone to oxymorphone and everything in between, and heroin was good ol' diacetylmorphine.\n\nAfter using the same technique to help multiple patients, Swiss Psychiatrist Dr. Robert Hammig, decided to it was time to [publish a case study showing how the same technique could work a variety of ways.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4959756/) The publication proved that it would work regardless of what opiate and dose, and that the time and dose schedule could be adjusted according to whatever the provider deemed appropriate, working in both inpatient and outpatient settings. I'll give a brief rundown of the schedule, but the actual schedules can be found in the link. The first example has the patient start day 1 with 0.2mg of bupe and 2.5 grams of street heroin. By the fifth day, she was up to 5mg of bupe and used the last of her heroin, half a gram. She continues upping the bupe and by day 9 is stable on 12mg. The second case in the study also started at 0.2mg of bupe on day one, and that's where the similarities end. This patient was not purchasing his heroin off the street, but instead was enrolled in a heroin maintenance treatment. A program where the government provides heroin for it's users twice daily, receive pharmaceutical diacetylmorphine while in the clinic (IV or oral) and then having a methadone take home to not WD at night. A formula is used to calculate the strength of his full opiate agonist and was converted to taking the equivalent of what milligrams of methadone. This guy was taking the equivalent of 130-180mg of methadone a day! It took 28 days for him to reach his stable bupe dose of 24mg/day. On day 28 he took his last agonist, 800mg of DAM and 40mg of methadone, equal to a dose of 140mg of methadone/day. The following day he reported yawning as his only wd symptom and it only lasted for that one day, followed by another 5 days of reporting 0 withdrawal symptoms.\n\nThe Bernese method has since been published in several scientific journals by multiple research groups using a variety of schedules and different opiates as the main agonist. [This publication](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7919736/) was the best I could find that compared different full opiate agonists at different amounts all being given the same dosing schedule. This article is proof that it does not matter which opiate you use nor does it matter how much you were using. It does go to say that the people who were receiving their opiate from a program, like a government clinic, all remind sober after one month. These participants also reduced their tolerance before starting micro-induction. However, Hammig proved in the previous study we looked at that dose tapering is not required to avoid PWD, as proven by Case 2 in his study that was taking 180mg of methadone. However, that patient followed a much slower increase of his bupe than this study. All participants avoided PWD, but lacking from this study is the COWS/SOWS/OOWS which would inform us how bad the withdrawal is. [In Hammig's Case 2 article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4959756/table/t2-sar-7-099/?report=objectonly), a table with time, bupe, SOWS, and even the actual wd symptoms is provided. We can rationalize that opiate agonist strength/quantity is inversely related to induction quantity/frequency. That means that the heavier users need to go easier with their micro-inductions.\n\nLets recap the Bernese method. [A typical dose schedule will look like this table](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7919736/table/T2/?report=objectonly), although the creator of the method recommends the first day starting on 0.2mg. Tbh, I don't believe there's much of a difference between 0.2mg and 0.5mg. While it is recommended to taper down the amount of fent you are using prior to induction, it's actually not necessary. Just know that the longer, heavier habits will have more wd symptoms with higher COWS/SOWS scores or will take longer because of slower increases of bupe to keep wd to a minimum or non-existent. There are several different jump off points. The most common is 8mg/day, although others stop the fent at less. Once you've hit 8mg of suboxone in one day though, you can stop the fent, and next day take all 8mg at once, and if that is not enough to get you well, keep taking 2-4mg every 2-3 hours until withdrawal symptoms are reduced. Minor withdrawal symptoms are normal and to be expected. As a person reaches 4+mg per day, the effects of fentanyl or whatever agonist will no longer occur. This is where our addictive brains will try to get us to stop taking the subs and get high \"one last time.\" Don't fall for it. This one last time shit does not exist. Do not be a complete pussy and start crying that it's just too hard because it took away your nod. No shit, you're not supposed to be falling out in public anymore. These are minor symptoms like the chills, some body aches, and yawning. All anxiety is really in your head realizing that you can no longer use this as an escape from life's shittiness. And all minor wd symptoms will be gone in a day or less. Congrats! You've avoided precipitated withdrawal! Looks like you wont be shitting your pants as you simultaneously vomit and cry to your creator for an instant death.\n\n**Rapid Micro-Induction of Buprenorphine (The Bernese Method on steroids)**\n\nAs I was looking up micro induction I happened to stumble upon this. [Comparing rapid micro-induction and standard induction](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7881636/) of buprenorphine/naloxone for treatment of opioid use disorder. It was the first time I had seen an article mention rapid micro-induction. I was shocked when I seen the dose schedule and amount. The first day involves induction with 0.5mg of bupe, but unlike the traditional Bernese method where you'd wait until the following day to dose again, this method involved dosing again every 3 hours to ideally get to 4mg on the very first day. Day 2 follows the same schedule to dose every 3 hours, except now the amount is 1mg of bupe. By the end of the second day, you would reach the therapeutic dose of 8mg/day, and there would no longer be any need to take fent after the second day. Day 3 you start with a full dose of 8mg or even 16mg and if still feeling symptoms of withdrawal, you could take an additional 4mg of bupe every 3 hours until wd symptoms are extremely minor or gone completely. I couldn't believe it, could it really be that easy? I thought the magic behind the Bernese method working was because of the gradual increase in dose given every 12 or 24 hours. This paper is advocating that it can be done in 48 hours and could possible have better outcomes than the standard induction method. Note, that this is just a proposed protocol for a future randomized clinical trial. There is no actual data here. When I first read the article on my induction day and seen the 48 hour rapid micro induction, I decided instantly that this is the schedule I'd follow and instantly took another 0.5mg of bupe. Only when I started to get minor wd symptoms and wanted to check the average COWS for it did I realize this was just a proposal...\n\nAdditional articles supporting the three hour dose schedule method could be found in the works cited. [The only one not behind a paywall as of a woman who underwent back surgery and was put on multiple opioids](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7147949/), including methadone in the 21 days after her surgery. To better manage her pain, on the 22 day post surgery, the initiated a 3 day induction. Doses were also given every three hours and her COWS was reported daily, never exceeding a 5. While this case is of a patient suffering from pain management, there were also articles documenting the 3 hour dose for patients suffering from OUD. Even though it is behind a paywall, [this article](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Rapid-micro-induction-of-buprenorphine%2Fnaloxone-for-Klaire-%C5%BDivanovi%C4%87/53dd6a8e2174190acc1c9463d518c97db861fc5f) states that 2 patients suffering from OUD were transitioned onto bupe without causing PWD. No info about their use history, but the two tables that can be seen along with the abstract show the dosing schedule. One patient was dosing every 4 hours and discontinued agonist after 4 days, whereas the other patient was dosing every 3 hours and stopped taking agonist after 2 days.\n\n*What if I run out of fent? Can I still micro-induce so I don't have to sit around and wait until its 72 hours?*\n\nThere's not loads of stud out there to support this being a good idea until at least 48 hours. There are some studies that talk about putting people on bupe patches that release slowly, like 20micrograms/hour and that people do fine on them even within 30 min of last use, but the moment they take 1mg before the 40 hour mark they get super sick. [This study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ajad.13069) even states that they tried to induce 4mg bupe on fentanyl users after 24 hours and surprise surprise, PWD. The study then says they took two other participants and waited until the 48 hour mark and dosed 2mgs, which was fine... but then they dosed another 2mg just another hour later and... yeah, not good. After all the research I've done, if I make it to 48 hours, i'd induce a 0.5mg then wait 3 hours to induce 1mg, and continue that three hour 1 mg until i notice a significant change. either things get worse and i stop or things start to get much better and I go to a higher dose.\n\n**The Science Behind Rapid Micro-Induction**\n\n[The Pharmacology of Buprenorphine Microinduction for Opioid Use Disorder](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8020374/)\n\nThis article is hands down the best written article on the topic. The pharmacology shows that microinduction of bupe does more than just push off full agonists off the receptor and then just partially activate it. The article states that microinduction on bupe can reverse the downregulation of the mu opiate receptor that occurs from prolonged repeated use of the full on agonists. This will bring more functional receptors to the surface and allow for more binding sites for the bupe or full agonist. The authors also mentions that there need to be more studies done to truly understand the MOA for why microdosing bupe seems to be so beneficial.\n\n**How I did it?** (not recommended)\n\nDay1- 0.5mg X 3 (three hours apart and then sleep) total of 1.5mg\n\nDay 2- 1.0 mg around 10am, 1mg at 1pm, got cocky and took 1mg at 2pm and then started to feel some super mild wd... took 1mg at 6 pm and another 1mg at 10 for a total of 5 mg finished all my fetty only 0.3mg worth over 2 days.\n\nDay 3- 1 mg at at 11am 1 mg at 2am... but since I was out of dope I was too scared to take any more... so i waited until I picked up after 8pm. then i took 2mg after not using all day and felt much better. picking up was pointless so 4mg total\n\nDay 4- Woke up, took 4 mg around 10am. Felt great. Tried to smoke some of the fetty I got the previous day but didn't feel shit. Took 4 mg that night with no problem. I then fucked up and threw away my fent thinking I was in the clear, which was a massive fuck up.\n\nDay 5- 8 mg in the morning and felt sluggish all day, which is to be expected. However, come night time, I woke up in the middle of the night and began vomiting. I was committed to staying sober, so I refused to pick up.\n\nDay 6- 8mg in the morning again. I was still puking throughout the day, had no energy...\n\nDay 7-10- took 8mgs and progressively got better each day. Could finally sleep and be a functional member of society.\n\nI then proceeded to reduce my dose of suboxone over the next two weeks. It was definitely a shitty month, but I got through it. I reached out the the authors of the study where they suggest doing the rapid micro-induction and told him what happened to me. He told me that to avoid the massive withdrawals I had, I should have taken as much as 32 mg of suboxone. I didn't have that much suboxone, so I just toughed it out. Perhaps taking 32mg of sub per day would have worked, but I think the problem was the abrupt stopping of my full agonist, fentanyl. When I re-read the article discussing the pharmacology of micro-induction I came across this. \"Several other methodological questions in BUP microinduction warrant further consideration. First, the optimal time to discontinue the full opioid agonist remains understudied. For instance, it is possible that different full opioid agonists (e.g., methadone, oxycodone) may need to be discontinued at different time points during the microinduction, based on their pharmacodynamic (e.g., ligand-specific effects) or pharmacokinetic (e.g., differences in half-life) properties.\" Instead of stopping completely when I reached 8 mg like in the standard micro-induction (the non-rapid version), I should have continued to slowly taper off the fentanyl.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nDoes rapid micro-induction of buprenorphine work? YES! The trick which is not mentioned in any of the articles however, is to still continue to taper off the fent for another couple of days. My suggestion would be that once you get to 8mg of sub, only take a hit of fent when you are extremely sick. The pharmacology articles also makes a great point. \"Second, the role of patient expectancy in mediating the success of microinduction should not be understated. It is likely that positive expectations about the microinduction process impact the likelihood of completing it, and vice versa.\" What does that mean? Essentially, if you believe it'll work, then it'll work! It goes to show that withdrawal severity really is all mental. Clearly do not fuck up like I did and just stop abruptly. Do the rapid micro-induction, get up to 8 mg in 2-4 days, and taper off the fent. Will you feel 100%? No. Will you die? No! You have to really want to do this. I also recommend doing the rapid version because motivation tends to come and go. You only need to be really motivated for a day or two to be committed to rapid induction. In the standard Bernese Method, I know far too many people who give up on day 3 or 4. Rapid induction really gives you the chance of getting onto suboxone with no withdrawal. The downside? You're sober and have to actually deal with life and its consequences: this proves to be too much for a lot of people who then end up relapsing, unfortunately. [Here is a link to a google spreadsheet with a suggested schedule.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zGF-oG_Q4vciQtSdw4d6PRgDIRPLaMWzPxoUCyQvbDo/edit?usp=sharing) It includes days, times, what drug, how much, and your SOWS number. The first two sheets are protected from being edited. The first is a guide, and the second sheet is a sample for you to copy and then paste in a new sheet. Please name your sheet to either your reddit username so I can look at it and reach out of I see something interesting. I realize the last thing you want to do is type shit while in withdrawal, but the more people who submit data, the more people we can help later on.

Many of the WD symptoms will be in your head. Your attitude is what will determine if you actual can do this, or if you're going to stay an addict. I believe in you.\n\n\\*I am not a doctor and this is not actual medical advice. This is just what worked for me.",

    "title": "Hey there! Randomly wanted to post my story- I‚Äôm now 3 yrs clean from fentanyl!",
    "selftext": "Heyyy everyone,\n\nMy name is Colin Burke. I‚Äôm a Lead Engineer and a Musician/Songwriter- I‚Äôm just celebrating 3 years of continuous sobriety from what became a fentanyl addiction. Still a bit surreal there. Here‚Äôs a documentation of my story- not all details included, but thought it may help some. We can ALL achieve recovery. (HMU @ linktr.ee/cb34r I make music but also sponsor folks- I‚Äôm here for support if needed). Well! Here it goes‚Ä¶\n\nI‚Äôm currently 32. When I was 18 I started having heart arrhythmias- it took doctors 4 years to figure out what the actual issue was. Meanwhile, I was in college and really had never been drunk or high in any capacity- although I have had ‚ÄúOCD‚Äù since about age 11- so I knew was depression was, and was taking antidepressants on and off.\n\nDuring this time, I was prescribed Hycodan for a cough. As someone with anxiety/IBS, was struggling with massive life threatening issues- it surprisingly solved all my problems at once. I could continue to make records and was not constantly distracted by my heart.\n\nI didn‚Äôt catch a habit until early 2011 for a couple months. I told my parents immediately and went to AA. I got clean on my own cold Turkey for the first time 04/2011. By the grace of goodness, I also found out what my heart issue was- and it was curable with an ablation (nearly outpatient minimally invasive heart procedure). I had this done 09/2011 around my 22nd birthday.\n\nI had been clean for about 5 months at this point- and since the hospital gave me opioids, I had a hunger. I had a lot of pain and was given Vicodin.\n\nFor the next 4 years I was mostly clean but have a couple binges a year. Ultimately, I couldn‚Äôt be who I wanted to for the woman I was with(even though I did want to marry her) and she immediately left, my parents moved, and a couple of my best friends stopped talking to me. The band I was in was taking off fast- but we had a disagreement and parted ways.\n\nI was very isolated and tried something called Tianeptine. This is some hardcore shit- look it up if you don‚Äôt know what it is. I didn‚Äôt expect it to work- but it felt better than oxy to me. \n\nI went up to 10 grams a day over the next year. I had to take benzos to even out the neurological effects. I gained 90 lbs. I wanted help but was afraid doctors couldn‚Äôt help given the unknown substance!\n\nGod intervened. In April 2016 I had a grand mal seizure at work. I just woke up on a stretcher, but I had nothing to lose at this point. I spent 7 days alone in the ICU shitting on myself because I couldn‚Äôt walk. No meds at all for withdrawal because the doctors were naturally afraid of this strange substance. I was then sent to the psych ward for three days because I was okay but still couldn‚Äôt walk or sleep. I didn‚Äôt sleep for 9 days, honestly.\n\nI was in a much better headspace and started walking 5-10 miles a day. The weight was coming off fast, thankfully I‚Äôm 6‚Äô4‚Äù so I was left with minor stretch marks and that‚Äôs about it.\n\nIn August 2016 someone introduced me to ‚Äúheroin.‚Äù I rationalized this by saying ‚Äúat least it‚Äôs traditional opioids and know what to expect.‚Äù I was living in the Boston area‚Ä¶it was fentanyl. I soon discovered up in Lawrence you could get this ‚Äúheroin‚Äù for as little as $15-20/g. \n\nI had two cars repossessed just before this and my license was suspended for getting in 3 accidents in just one summer.\n\nSo late 2016 I was taking the train to Lawrence, working as an engineer, and still making records. I was losing more possessions and friends though.\n\nI lost my job taking my friends car to go relapse. I wasn‚Äôt a constant user but couldn‚Äôt stay away- I would go to AA and leave after 90 days or so because I thought my problem was ‚Äúfixed.‚Äù\n\nEarly 2017 I was in the best IOP- Right Turn. It‚Äôs an IOP + therapy and meals for musicians and artists. MusiCares helped me get in- thank god because affording programs were always an issue.\n\nIt helped for the better but I wish I took it slightly more serious. I put in the work for a few months and moved on. Was in a relationship for the rest of the year and relapsed at the end- per usual.\n\n2018 was more of the same- getting great jobs but lost two because I was in withdrawal almost always. I couldn‚Äôt afford to use daily and didn‚Äôt want to steal. Was seeing a different girl. I even missed accepting the New England Music Award I won! Crazy.\n\nLosing my second job in 01/19 was the last straw. I was blacked out- lost my work and personal computers, wallet, glasses, fractured my face and tore my rotator cuff. My parents offered if I gave them $3k I could come live with them for 4 months. I jumped on that and knew it was my only way out.\n\nMy best friend Zach passed from an overdose in 04/2019. I wrote a fantastic song the next day, but then overdosed myself. Thankfully my girl at the time had a bad feeling. She saved me.\n\nWent to his funeral and got to sing- but it was tough at 4 days clean from an overdose.\n\nI came here with only my two boxes of clothes, my guitars, and the one microphone I had left.\n\nI went into intensive therapy and got off any unnecessary medication. \n\n08/2019 I got a fantastic job opportunity- which I am still at today nearly 3 years later!\n\nIt was frightening. I‚Äôve worked for many startups- but it was a new city, new company, and the smallest I‚Äôve ever worked for. I worked like my life depended on it, because it did in some sense.\n\nDuring this time my teeth were rotting at an alarming rate- oddly enough mostly due to genetics. \n\nSo the last 3 years have had their tough spots. I got my entire mouth reconstructed. Obviously moving down to a city (I moved into my own place 09/2019) 6 months before COVID made it tough to make friends- so I still had isolation issues. I took it all out on my work and my passion(music).\n\nI started making a 12-step based recovery group the focal point of my life- I was finally open minded enough to consider changes and trying the steps. I was introduced to a sponsor who walked me through it all, and helped me have what I certainly would call a imported psychic change.\n\nThese days this is what my life looks like: I‚Äôve raised a Pit/Blue Lacy dog over the last 14 months and he‚Äôs gorgeous. I love being an engineering lead and also doing design, and design for manufacture working, I love having impact at such a small company.\n\nI play shows several times a week, I do 3-4 livestreams on twitch and also play at venues. I‚Äôm writing the best music of my life- and have released two records in the last 14 months (one LP, one EP).\n\nI maintain my recovery consciously with good habits; eating well, exercise, meditation, gratitude work (huge for me), and trying to interact with real humans whenever I get the chance. I‚Äôm not always in ‚Äútoo spiritual shape,‚Äù but I do a decent job.\n\nI have a 1100 sq ft 2BR/2BTh apartment I share with my dog. One bedroom is the recording/live studio and I do a lot of work from home as well.\n\nI take accountability for all my actions. I settled all my debts from collections, the IRS, and people I‚Äôve wronged. My credits going back up so fast I was able to get a new car last year!\n\nI have furniture- what a blessing! I have a cool studio with lighting and do fun live-streaming shows- and it‚Äôs also comfy to write records in that room.\n\nI also volunteer my time helping other alcoholics/addicts.\n\nEnough about the material stuffs- that‚Äôs not what truly matters.\n\nI‚Äôm just here to say if I can do it, YOU can do 100%. I should be dead by all human logic. While I take some things more seriously- I still don‚Äôt take life too seriously. It helps. I have indeed found a power greater than myself.\n\nIt took me many years to connect the dots- that when I subconsciously think I need drugs to feel good or do anything- I am effectively ‚Äúworshipping‚Äù them. That was a mindblower for me when my sponsor told me that. \n\nI‚Äôve had experiences I cannot fully describe- and I have been fostering faith. I‚Äôm not religious, I may be some day but I certainly don‚Äôt believe life is a random accident from gross goo.\n\nSo much of what we go through has to do with our outlooks on life, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned. \n\nAnywho! I plan to keep making awesome music, being an upstanding citizen in my community, and stay in my recovery program forever! The recovery in South Austin is so amazing. I am so grateful and humbled to all that have helped me get back on my feet.\n\nIt feels righteous to have my actions be in line with what I want to do in life. It‚Äôs rewarding and reinforces my positive attitude :).\n\n5 years ago I was a cynical person who was certain he would die destitute and early. Now my outlook has truly done a 180- and I see that humans are so much more than just these temporary lives we live (my belief anyway). \n\nKeep trying! Never ever ever give up! I was sick for many years straight but kept trying!!! Even if I do relapse with many many years- I vow to promptly admit whenever I‚Äôm wrong- and make things right.\n\nI wish you all the best of luck. If you‚Äôre reading this- someone wants you on this earth. That I am certain. We are all worthy and deserving of recovery. \n\nLove,\nColin Burke",

The anxiety is horrible and the depression is back with a strength that I haven‚Äôt felt since I first quit dope back in 2019. That real dark, heavy, soul crushing kind of depression that makes you lie on the floor for days. I‚Äôm barely sleeping an hour a night and when I do sleep I am screaming and crying so it‚Äôs not restful. \n\nI‚Äôve been through a lot the last few months. But I went through it and am continuing to go through it WITHOUT using fentanyl ‚Äî or any painkiller. I can‚Äôt even recall having any real cravings for it in this whole hellish time period, which is fucking amazing because there was a time where if I had the slightest problem or inconvenience I would take it as an excuse to run back and relapse. Now, the world is shattering around me half the days and I never even hear the whisper of that old voice saying ‚Äúgo numb yourself with drugs‚Äù. \n\nAfter basically being in a depression coma for the last week I was suddenly inspired after some medical marijuana and some long therapy sessions to make this post. Because, well....\n\nThis is real. Updates about being clean aren‚Äôt always going to be sunshine and rainbows and Everything Is Great Now! Life keeps happening.

    "selftext": "I‚Äôm writing this for myself and posting it for anyone that it might help. I am a 30 year old male. I‚Äôm white collar, as if that makes me any better. Just more lonely. I‚Äôve been addicted to opiates for ten years now. Over the past decade I‚Äôve stitched together some sober months by ‚Äúwhite knuckling‚Äù but over the past 18 months I‚Äôve been able to put together more sober time than not.\n\nThe big difference over the past 18 months is that I‚Äôve started doing the work. I‚Äôm lucky and I have a lot of resources at my disposal. I‚Äôve started seeking help. My relapses over the past 18 months have typically been due to the emotions that arise from the work I‚Äôve been doing, which I consider to be an improvement.\n\nI‚Äôve been doing 1:1 therapy, group therapy, mindfulness courses, yoga practice, etc. I‚Äôm partial to holistic stuff and I‚Äôm too ashamed to go to inpatient. Realistically\n\nSide not to those that say every relapse restarts you at zero: that‚Äôs not always true. Every relapse over the past 18 months has been shorter and less severe than ever before. Catching myself and getting on track is easier with mild withdrawals. I am moving forward. No matter what some people will say.\n\nRight now I‚Äôm coming off a week-long slip on hydro. It‚Äôs Day 3 and it‚Äôs not that bad. I‚Äôm focusing on getting back on the schedule that has been helping me over the year and a half. I don‚Äôt always follow it completely and sometimes I quit tasks early, but I really find that just TRYING to follow this LOOSE structure really helps. Again, in the first few days after a mild relapse I really try to bring myself back to this routine, WITH KINDNESS. The first week I maybe did half of these things on half the days, but each week it gets better and you start to really remember how much it helps.\n\nMORNING\n\nWhen I‚Äôm clean I cannot sleep in for shit and I‚Äôve embraced it. I get up between 5:30 ‚Äì 6 am. I take a few deep breaths before I get out of bed and say some sort of affirmation (e.g. You Got Today) and then quickly GET UP.\n\n1. Make bed\n\n2. Drink water\n\n3. 5 min Stretch\n\n4. 30-45 min walk to get my blood flowing\n\n5. 10 min Stretch/Yoga\n\n6. Shower & wear something resembling real clothes\n\n7. Breakfast & Read something for 15 minutes\n\nAFTERNOON\n\nThe days are long when you‚Äôre sober. Especially if you‚Äôre up at 6AM. I try to re-center myself mid-day by:\n\n1. 15-30 minute walk\n\n2. 25 minute nap\n\nEVENING\n\nI‚Äôm usually in bed by 8:30 or 9, which is probably crazy to most of you. By 5pm I‚Äôm really winding down my day. I try to have an evening routine as well.\n\n1. After logging off from work, I‚Äôll take another quick walk.\n\n2. My appetite is still generally very low so I try to put together more of a grazing dinner\n\n3. Zoom with some old friends for an hour or so. I live alone and quarantine has been super tough on me. Ending the day talking to an old friend really grounds me.\n\n4. Music/reading‚Äîno screen time\n\n5. Smoke some sort of indica flower. This is my reward and my sleep helper. So many times in WD I would smoke 24/7, but two weeks later I‚Äôd still have no energy. DUH. These days, I don‚Äôt smoke during the day and it‚Äôs a bit right before bed.\n\n6.

    "selftext": "As of today, I‚Äôm 60 days clean from ~ a gram/day fent addiction. I‚Äôve been addicted to damn near every drug imaginable since I was 16 and in the past 10 years Ive done a pretty awesome job of fucking my life up and the situations of those that were unfortunate enough to be close to me. I‚Äôve had bouts of sobriety here and there, but it‚Äôs never really been my choice so it never stuck. \n\n60 days ago I made the decision to kick this demon of an addiction and get my life back.  The first 10 days were the most hellish experience I could have ever imagined. And due to not wanting to lose my job, I had to work days 2-9. The whole experience was the worst thing I‚Äôve ever been through, and I can honestly say that this time I am done. I never want to experience that again. Obviously I have days where I would much rather snort some shit and mask my issues rather than face them. But I‚Äôll take small life issues every day before I would go back to that nightmare. I am finally free to wake up in the morning and make my own decisions. I can contribute to my job and more importantly to my girlfriend, who one day soon I hope to make my wife and start a family with. \n\nI still struggle with depression on a semi-regular basis. I seem to have equally as many bad days as good. Not to sound cliche, but my worst day sober is better than any average day when I was using. I feel like I‚Äôm past the ‚Äúpink cloud‚Äù phase of sobriety, and real life issues are becoming more apparent. I‚Äôm no longer in the mindset that being clean magically solves all my problems. But now that I‚Äôm clean, I can look at issues as a challenge, rather than some insurmountable issue that I break down over. \n\nI know this is long, and thank you to those that have read this far. I guess if I were to describe my current state of emotion right now in one word, it would be ‚Äúfree‚Äù. I‚Äôm no longer a slave of my own addiction. It‚Äôs still there and will never leave. But now I‚Äôm in control, I‚Äôm able to make my own decisions, and every day I make the decision to stay clean and keep working. To those still struggling, reach out. You need support if you‚Äôre ever going to make this work. \n\nFor the first month of getting clean, I used Kratom regularly, along with a few other supplements. I slowly tapered off of that. I‚Äôve had a couple bad days here and there and taken 1mg or so of suboxone to kill the cravings and allow me to get through to the next day. If I had insurance I would have tried to get just Naltrexone, but I‚Äôm buying off the street so resources are limited. I also still smoke weed on a regular basis to help with anxiety and insomnia. Some may not consider me ‚Äúclean‚Äù, but consider me whatever you want. I‚Äôm finally free and I‚Äôm never going back. Anyone still struggling, feel free to reach out and PM me. I don‚Äôt have all the answers, I‚Äôm still finding them myself. But I‚Äôve made it 60 days and I never could‚Äôve imagined myself doing that. So if you have any questions, don‚Äôt hesitate to PM me. \n\nThanks everyone who read this far. I know I ramble.",

At this point the withdrawal symptoms are very mild and completely tolerable. I'll admit, the first week was absolute hell but I am still here going strong. Just a few tips if you're going through it:\n\n- Stay hydrated (Gatorade, Vitamin Water, Pedialyte etc.. Water is ok but you really need those electrolytes.) \n- Walk (This helped a ton with RLS and kept my mind off of the body aches. It also helps me sleep a little better.)\n- Keep Yourself Busy (Get some funny stuff to watch. Maybe a new hobby.)\n- Get Some Rest (This is a tough one, but you really need it so your body can heal. I don't have any tips except for maybe turning your phone off and reading a good book. It helped me.)\n- Vitamins (This was crucial for me. I stacked Vitamin C, B6, B12 and D3. I didn't go crazy high with the doses, just enough.)\n- Eat Bananas (This was also very crucial. The potassium in bananas helped my body tremendously with the muscle aches and tightness.)\n- Earplugs (I bought a set on Amazon for pretty cheap. I used these before bed and they really helped me stay asleep without getting woken up by the slightest noise. Your body needs that rest.)\n- Hot Baths (This is my favorite. It relaxes the muscles and helped me fall asleep much faster. I took maybe 3 or 4 a day during the worst of times.)\n\nThis is a tough journey but you can do it. For those of you who have already been through it and have not gone back, I commend  you. If you fail, do not worry. Just get focused and get back on track immediately. You can win the fight, you just have to believe in yourself!\n\nThat is all and good luck in your journey! \n\nSincerely, your boy,\n- 4ChanTheHackerMan",

What I thought was an impossibility a few years ago has turned into a reality. As I sit here reflecting on all I've been through all I've lost due to my issues with addiction I am overwhelmed with joy. Why joy you ask? Because all that I have gained in these short 9 months of sobriety vastly outweighs the past. As I sit here I am feeling something I haven't felt in a long time...pride. Pride because all the garbage and bullshit I fought through has made me the man I am today. A strong, hardworking, giving, loyal tough sonofabitch that now feels he can do anything he puts his mind to. But most of all humble. There is no way I could've done this alone. So many people have helped me get to where I am today.. People around me believed in me enough not to give up on me and it wasn't until I was finally ready to come to terms with the fact that I couldn't do this alone that I have succeed....so far. Tomorrow is not guaranteed. So just for today...I have succeeded. Thank you all so much. \n\n10/30-7/30. 9 amazing months...and I truly believe it can/will get better. \nIf you are struggling with substance abuse issues please don't suffer alone. Take the first step in LIVING your life and ask for help.",

    "selftext": "So I have been hooked on fent, for 2 years. My addiction grew from a monthly doctors script for 30- 5mg Percocet, to 100- 10mg oxy, to buying blue Mexican 30s (which we all know are fentanyl) from a dealer and easily using 25 a day. My husband is the same, doctors script to Mexican oxy, and we use the same amount. Our method of consumption was sniffing them, and doing it around every hour, eventually 2 at a time. I was getting ready to check into detox and dreading it, We‚Äôre parents, We have children and can‚Äôt just leave, so this wasn‚Äôt a very good option for us. ENTER vitaminC megadosing! Nobody was more skeptical than me! I did it purely to prove to my friend that it wouldn‚Äôt work, what a joke‚Ä¶ vitaminC? Seriously? I felt like she just didn‚Äôt get it. We weaned down as far as we could without feeling like dying, which was 7-10 pills a day, and bought a bottle of powdered sodium ascorbate (this is preferable to ascorbic acid) for $20 (the price of 5 pills I thought‚Ä¶) and I put 1/4tsp into each of 10-8oz water bottles, filled them the rest of the way with diluted fruit juice. \nDay 1 I drank 12 bottles, (15g vitC) used 3 blue pills, \nDay 2 drank 16 bottles  (20g vitC) \nUsed 3 blue pills\nDay 3 I added 1/2tsp this time to the bottles and drank 10 bottles.  (25g vitC) \nUsed 2 blue pills in 8 pieces\nDay 4 drank 12 bottles (30g vitC) \nUsed 1 blue pill cut into 4 pieces.\nDay 5 this is where I am now, I have not had any oxy, I feel great, I plan to drink 25g vitC, and taper to 20g tomorrow, to 15g, to 10g, and then whatever, I‚Äôll feel it out. I basically have no physical cravings, and nearly NO withdrawal symptoms, besides the mental and emotional urge, which is honestly not doing me in, it‚Äôs manageable. I feel hopeful again, I can see my future, I have so much HOPE!!!!!! Please please please, TRY THIS!!!! It can not hurt, you can not overdose on vitamin C. Google the protocol, I found a YouTube video called I‚Äôm possible, and an article on opiataddictionsupport dot com, and I also ordered a supplement called Elimidrol, they have a nighttime and daytime formula, they even have financial assistance, and I‚Äôve heard great reviews on it. This is amazing, I‚Äôm in disbelief, I just can‚Äôt even. This is it you guys. VITAMIN C IS THE WAY OUT!!!!!",

I tapered off of my usually daily dose over the course of 2 weeks, just halfing my dosage every day or two and pushing myself to go as long as I could between using. The 3rd week I forced myself to only use one time every 24 hours and would take as little as I possibly could to allow myself to sleep. The last 5 days without using at all have been difficult, but manageable, and much less intense than any of my previous attempts at getting clean. Ive been using liposomal vitamin c along with gabapentin, and a very small dose of kratom (like 1 or 2g a day) in the evening if I'm unable to sleep. Ive been mentally ready to stop taking this poison for at least 6 months, but feared the insomnia and overall shitty WD symptoms, now that I am slowly starting to feel better I only wish I had done it sooner. This sub has been a Godsend, I honestly believe it has saved my life... Thank you all from the bottom of my heart for that. I'm going to be traveling back home to California in the next week or two to visit my father whom I haven't seen in almost 2 years due to my addiction and depression issues, Im so excited to see him again and that I will be clean when I do. No matter what stage of your recovery you are in right now, just keep fighting and if you slip up, own that shit and get right back in the fight. Its not easy to stay clean, but it is so worth it.

    "selftext": "I‚Äôm forty years old. I was an alcoholic and opiate addict for over twenty years. My addiction took me to the psych ward, jail, rehab multiple times, living in a trap house, living in a shed, homelessness, and the loss of everything that was once important to me.\n\nI got sober on May 1st of 2018. I had to. I was on a path to death if I didn‚Äôt. If the drugs didn‚Äôt kill me I was surely going to kill myself. My life had lost all meaning. I was a hollow shell of the bright and principled young man I had once been. I was weighed down by trauma, guilt, and the shame of who I‚Äôd become. \n\nWhen I got sober it was tough. I had to really get honest with myself and others and I had to finally confront the trauma that had haunted me. I had to accept and move past the shame and guilt. These things were not easy and they took over 150 therapy sessions to work through. During that time I also had to learn how to live a sober life. It seems like such a simple thing, but for some of us our addictions are the only thing we know as we‚Äôve been trapped by them since our youth. \n\nI also had to deal with the daily stressors of life that normally would‚Äôve been my triggers. My home flooded and I lost everything with no insurance to cover it. My car blew the engine. My sister went into kidney failure. Other people betrayed my trust when I confided my recovery to them. These events where all devastating to me in my early recovery. \n\nFor a long time I lived in perpetual misery as happiness seemed elusive. Nothing could bring me joy. I accepted it as my punishment for the life I led and continued to stay sober one day at a time. Slowly things began to get better. I learned how to live a sober life and how to cope in healthy ways. I got a job and then a better one. But still I couldn‚Äôt find contentment. \n\nI moved and changed all my people, places, and things. I went through quarantine. I went through a period of unemployment and then under employment. I saw the birth of my fifth niece (the first i was sober for). I got a decent job with real opportunities. I began to share my story in an effort to help others. I began to walk for exercise and to destress. And, somewhere along the way little glimpses of joy and happiness began to peek in. \n\nSobriety is a journey. Each day is one at a time slowly building something greater. Rome wasn‚Äôt built in a day. My addictions didn‚Äôt happen in a day. While my recovery isn‚Äôt over and in truth never will be I‚Äôm finally beginning to see the fruits of my labors. I may never have the life I once I dreamed of. But, I can dream a new dream now. I have hope again.",

    "selftext": "I'm not sure exactly what I'm looking for with this post, but I'm out in the jungle in Colombia with not much to do and some very unwanted thoughts. \n\nI had a roughly 2 year opiate habit, starting on 30-50 mg Norco per day and gradually increasing to dosing up to 100mg multiple times per day, with the occasional oxycodone sprinkled into the mix when I could find it. After realizing the error of my ways and the future that this habit held, and also realizing that if 100mg of hydro at once wasn't even doing the trick anymore, I \"quit\" by method of the \"wondrous and not harmful at all\" plant, kratom. 2 years of excessive kratom use later, I was forced off the stuff by way of a 6 month backpacking trip to South America. My two-week supply of kratom that I brought with me ran out in about one week (surprise!). After that I toughed out the uncomfortable withdrawals with a bit more ease than I thought. Although throughout the ensuing 4 months my life as a backpacker grew more and more debauched... My previous habit of heavy drinking returned, leading me to suspect that kratom played a huge role in curbing cravings to drink. Also, with the cheap and plentiful plethora of drugs available to me in South America, I began a phase of the heaviest cocaine use I've experienced in my life so far. Almost every night, one drink led to five, which led to a bag of coke or sometimes MDMA, which led to heroic levels of alcohol use. My cigarette habit, cold turkey for almost one year, back with a vengeance. So, well and good, off the opiates, finally off kratom... Traded for just about all the other shitty party habits one could imagine. Much more self destructive than kratom, and I've had many thoughts of just getting back on the K when I return home, to re-stabilize my behavior and cut the insane death wish - style partying out. It's worked in the past. Well, 4 months after the cessation of kratom, I encountered a pharmacy in Colombia. Tramadol, cheap as could be. What the hell, right? Couple days of that stupid half assed high and I'm back at the pharmacy inquiring about hydrocodone. Yes, they have that. Cool. Day or two of that, and it's \"oxycodone\"? Sure thing, come by tomorrow. After this I spent two weeks in an opiated haze, consuming about 100-120 mg of oxy every morning and throwing in a couple Norco for the hell of it. Then nighttime would arrive and it would be back on the party drugs, and benzos in the wee hours to force a chemical induced sleep. Every new drug I ingested I wondered if this would be the combo that killed me. It was fucked. I escaped the city I was in as soon as I realized how deep I was in. I'm now at an isolated spot in the jungle, purposely having brought no opiates with me,  having realized I slipped right back into my old tolerance, my old dependence, after just 2 weeks. Apart from kicking the shit out of myself for having been stupid enough to consider purchasing that demonic substance again, now I am 3 days off of all that and, being far from any major civilization, a bit bored. But the point of this story is that now I'm experiencing, just as intense as ever, the craving. The fantasizing. \"wouldn't this be so much better if you were a couple oxy 40's in?\" I fucking hate these thoughts and couldn't have imagined how quickly they would creep back into my mind after years of not using true opiates. The slope was more slippery than I ever could have imagined. So, for lack of a better question, what the FUCK do I do now? -an open question to the world of Reddit.",

Long before I quit, I accepted I would die that way. My tolerance was so high, I was spending $300/day on heroin from Philly/Newark--which was about the purest in the country at that time. I had a job that paid 6 figures, so I could afford the dope (although I admit I struggled to to keep my lights on, and extras like cable or internet were above my budget.)\n\nEverything about my life is different today. I live 1000 miles away from Philly ( I had to move, I couldn't be successful there). No one in my life today has any experience with in active addiction.\n\nI am so grateful ",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\n[Before and After](https://imgur.com/7Xe2VDG)\n\n5 months ago today (on the left) I lost almost everything I knew that made my existence even worth living for. I had been on a run for about 2 years, lost multiple good jobs, multiple cars, my family's support for the umpteenth time, lost my place to live, friends not even wanting to be around me, and most importantly I lost my kids to CPS weeks prior to this photo. I've been in recovery before and had relapses but the consequences I endured were never as serious as they were this time around. I packed my things up that I had left to my name and got on a bus to get anywhere but where I was and go to a treatment facility that I knew would detox me, help me get my life together, and give me a fighting chance in recovery. I needed a change in the worst way possible. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n5 months ago today (on the right) I made a life changing decision to trust in my higher power and what he had in store for me. I did any and everything I could to not have to use again. Today marks 5 months clean from all mind altering substances, since then I've started working with a very prominent company doing what I love, I've gotten my g/f (pictured) out here and in treatment (4 months sober now), appeased all of my courts for my kids and charges back home, gotten back almost everything that I've lost due to my addiction, and most importantly I've gotten my sanity back. I've had stints of sobriety before longer than 5 months but I've never given my all to this program and trusted my higher power. You can have the same happiness that you see and you can have your life back but it has to start with giving up and asking for help.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you all that post in this subreddit because your posts and stories are what help me in my life even if you don't know it.",

    "selftext": "> Once you've seen a solution to the disease that's tearing you apart, relapsing is never fun.  You know there's an alternative to the way you're living and that you're going against something you've been given for free by the universe, this key to the kingdom.  Drug addiction is a progressive disease, so every time you go out, it gets a little uglier than it was before; it's not like you go back to the early days of using, when there was less of a price to pay.  It isn't fun anymore, but it is still desperately exciting.  Once you put that first drug in your body, you don't have to worry about the girlfriend or the career or the family or the bills.  All those mundane aspects of life disappear.  Now you have one job, and that's to keep chucking the coal in the engine, because you don't want this train to stop.  If it stops, then you are going to have to feel all that other shit.  \n\n> The chaos is always exciting.  There are cops and bad guys and freaks and hookers.  You're diving into a big insidious video game, but again, you're being tricked into thinking you're doing something cool, since the price is always bigger than the payoff.  You immediately give up your love and your light and your beauty, and you become a dark black hole in the universe, sucking up bad energy and not walking around putting a smile on someone's face or helping someone out or teaching someone something that's going to help his or her life.  You're not creating the ripple of love you're creating the vacuum of shit.  I want to describe both sides of how I felt, but it's important to know that in the end, all the romantic glorification of dope fiendery amounts to nothing but a hole of shit.  It has to appear enticing because that's why God or the universe, or whatever you want to call it put that energy here.  It's a learning tool, and you can either kill yourself with it or you can turn yourself into a free person with it.  I don't think drug addiction is useless.  \n> \n\nPretty interesting book.  In the last chapter he goes full on 12 step and it's not bad at all.  He has a very interesting take on it all.  I particularly like;  \n  \n>Addicts are sometimes described as egomaniacs with inferiority complexes.  Or, to be cruder, a piece of shit that the universe revolves around.  \n\nHah.  Anyway.

    "selftext": "5 years ago I got arrested. My wife had enough and was ready to move out with the kids. My employer caught wind about my arrest and subsequently my addiction.  Got fired. I had about $100,000 in debt as a direct result of my $200 a day habit.  I had no idea what I was going to do. All I knew was that the jig was up and enough was enough.  This was my rock bottom.\n\n\nI was able to hire an attorney for my legal problems.  He suggested I go to treatment as it would help my case. So I did.  I started IOP and it opened my eyes to the world of recovery. Until this, my addiction was a secret.  My shame i had to carry around alone. How could a young father of 2 with a professional career be a heroin addict?  I couldn't talk to anyone, it was embarrassing. Now, able to speak to others who were going through this, it became a lot easier to deal with.  I also spoke to a doctor and got put on Suboxone.  They saved my life, my career, and my family.\n\n\nFast forward 5 years and I'm off Suboxone, completely free.  The monkey is off my back. My kids are now teenagers and don't have to deal with a heroin addict father.  My relationship with my wife is better than it has ever been. I've financially recovered. I own a home and 2 vehicles. We go on vacations and I don't have to stress about having enough junk to last through it.  I can have fun again. I can laugh, love, cry, and experience life as it's meant to be. Not everyday is awesome but my worst day now is better than my best day while I was in active addiction. \n\n\nTo all who are in the shit.... Hang in there.  There's help if you want it.  There are people who genuinely care about your well being.  You don't have to do this alone and it's not shameful to tell someone you need help. Truly admit you are powerless and the addiction is unmanageable. Life is precious. You are loved.  You are worth it. You can do it. ",

This post is a reminder that no matter how much time you‚Äôve accumulated, this shit creeps up on you. What happened: I had to have surgery, non invasive, and no incisions, so no pain meds required. Well I take prescriptions nsaids and a biologic injection to maintain chronic pain from an autoimmune illness. I had to stop taking my meds for a week before and a week after the procedure. I was miserable. In so much pain, I could barely get out of bed. The addict deep down inside me justified buying dirty 30s because ‚Äúpain justifies this‚Äù. Well I‚Äôm an idiot. Those were gone in 3 days- I bought 8 of them. I had zero opiate tolerance but fuck it right? Next thing I know, I‚Äôm buying a gram of fentanyl and shooting up in my bathroom to ‚Äúkill the pain‚Äù. But really I just relapsed and was fully consumed by my addiction and refusing to admit it because ‚Äúmy back and hips hurt‚Äù. Even after almost 8 fucking years of beating this bullshit and building a beautiful life again, this insidious bastard took over and my husband and 6yr old son found me on the bathroom floor unconscious.

I‚Äôll never forget the fear in his voice. I‚Äôll never forget the fear in my husbands heart. I got up and flushed the drugs, broke the syringe in half, and fell into my husbands arms. I don‚Äôt deserve this man who is so quick to forgive and love me. I‚Äôm not really sure how long it‚Äôs going to take me to forgive myself. It‚Äôs been 3 weeks since that night, and i still cry thinking about how much I‚Äôve failed. I don‚Äôt usually share things like this but I feel like this group is a safe space, and maybe this is a reminder to anyone dealing with chronic pain: no matter how much time you have under your belt, addiction will always be a part of you, and there is no justifying opiate use.

    "selftext": "Just posting my experience for anyone who‚Äôs lurking, thinking about jumping off, dreading withdrawals‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm day 18 clean, I was taking 80-120 mg of Oxy a day but I tapered down with Kratom before jumping off. Here‚Äôs what helped during withdrawals:\n\n- Liposomal Vitamin C (4000mg every 4-6 hours for the first 2 weeks) takes away basically 100% of the flu-like symptoms aside from occasional sneezes. Total godsend, must have for withdrawals. Be sure to get Liposomal Vit C, other kinds of Vit C can be acidic and not great at taking in high doses \n\n- Loperamide (2mg every 4-6 hours for the first 2 weeks) takes away 90% of the stomach/bathroom issues for me, total godsend, must have. Stop taking after you‚Äôre 2 weeks clean though, you don‚Äôt want your stomach to get dependent on it \n\n- Magnesium Citrate helps a good bit with restless legs. I haven‚Äôt found a ‚Äòget out of jail free card‚Äô with RLS though, nothing really takes it away completely, but Magnesium helps enough that it‚Äôs totally worth taking\n\n- Black Seed Oil also helps with restless legs a decent bit. Nothing too miraculous but when the RLS get unbearable, this helps bring it down to a manageable level. \n\n- Wim Hof breathing. Just YouTube it and do the beginner exercise. It‚Äôs just breathing. Might not be everybody‚Äôs cup of tea but I highly recommend it, any time the doom/dread of withdrawals became unbearable I would do some Wim Hof breathing and it would totally soothe me\n\n- go outside and walk around somewhere, even if it‚Äôs just the dollar store to buy some water. It‚Äôs natural to spend most of the day inside while detoxing, just be sure to go out at least once a day, helps with the doom and claustrophobia \n\nAll this combined made withdrawals totally manageable for me. It‚Äôs still withdrawals, it still sucks, but you can cut the suffering in half. \n\nEverything I listed is something that 100% helped, I wouldn‚Äôt waste my time or yours by recommending something that didn‚Äôt make a noticeable difference. Best of luck guys!",

    "selftext": "Young dude here, 22. I started using opiates with weaker stuff like kratom, and codeine. As my tolerance rose I dabbled into stronger opiates, started snorting dilaudid's and then before you know it I'm smoking fent off foil everyday. If you use fentanyl be very careful, I had a few close calls. I hurt my family a lot, especially my mother and my sister. In my active addiction I had an overdose one night at 4 in the morning, I blacked out that night, spend hundreds of dollars and had multiple different drugs in my system.  Thank God my sister was around to administer CPR on me otherwise I'd be gone. It still hurts me to know my sister had to see me in that state.   I got clean almost a month ago, I chose to go to detox cold turkey, refused suboxone and methadone because I wasn't going to treat my drug addiction with drugs, and went through a gnarly WD. I feel much better now, no, my life isn't perfect but nobody's is. Opioid addiction is emotionally draining, stressful, a huge financial burden, and the routine of buying dope everyday or every second day is so fucking mundane. When I'd go to NA or AA meetings while I was still using, I'd see people with 5, 10, 20 years sober and wonder how the fuck they did it. But here I am, doing it and at times wondering exactly how, but I'm doing it, and I'm so damn proud of myself, I'm finally learning to really love and accept myself for who I am, and I'm never going back to the lifestyle I used to live. At times I still think of getting high, maybe one last time, but I know myself enough to know that I'd fall right back into using everyday, it's just not worth it anymore. Like an alcoholic, for me one is too much and a thousand isn't enough. I'm nobody special and if  I can get sober anybody can.  Here's to the rest of my life and yours too :')",

    "selftext": "Dear Addict Haters:\nHello, you don‚Äôt know me but I am an addict. I am one of the ‚Äújunkies‚Äù you love to bash whenever someone mentions addiction on social media or hear it in conversation. I know it‚Äôs hard to forgive the things we sometimes do because of our addiction, but I have a question for you. What is the worst thing you have ever done? Obviously, I won‚Äôt get an answer to this question but think about it. The thing that you hate that you did. You know, that one thing that not too many people even know about. Well, what if everyone knew about it? What if for the rest of your life you were labeled by that one act that you would erase in a second if you had the chance? That is what being an addict is like, kind of. Now, I don‚Äôt feel like being an addict is the worst thing a person can be or do. You, however, feel like it‚Äôs a terrible thing. Don‚Äôt get me wrong: If I could erase it from my life, I would. In an instant, it would be gone, but I don‚Äôt have that option. I can‚Äôt even do what you do and pretend that this thing I did didn‚Äôt happen. In order for me to ensure it never happens again, I have to work hard on making sure it doesn‚Äôt. If I don‚Äôt, my disease will tell me I can have a drink or do a line and not fall back into full-blown addiction, but I will.\nDo you work hard to make sure your worst thing never happens again? Let me guess... you are thinking, Addiction is not a disease. It‚Äôs a choice. Right? \nYes, all addiction starts with a choice.\nThe same damn choice you made when you were young and hanging out with friends. You drank the same beer I drank. The same pot I smoked. You even tried the same line of white stuff someone put in front of you at a party. You were able to walk away and not take it to the extreme.\nSince I have the disease, I will spend the rest of my life either struggling to stay high or fighting to stay clean.\nAs children, we don‚Äôt decide we would rather be an addict instead of a cop.\nYou don‚Äôt see children pretending that their dolls and stuffed animals are dope sick.\nWhen is the last time you talked to a little girl who told you she couldn‚Äôt wait to grow up so she could turn tricks to feed the insatiable hunger of her drug addiction?\nMy aunt didn‚Äôt tell me about her exciting plans to become homeless.\nMy dad, not one time, told my mother to think twice before marrying him because he had high hopes of becoming an angry drunk.\nMy best friend didn‚Äôt blow out the candles as a child wishing for a substance abuse disorder because she couldn't wait for the day her kids would go to foster care.\nNobody Wants to have substance use disorder.\nSome of us just do.\nSo always remember:\nYou made those same choices, too.\nYou just got lucky that it was me and not you.\nIf you still have doubts, you can take those up with the Center for Disease Control or the United States Surgeon General. They have classified addiction as a disease, but then again... I am sure you know more about it than they do, right?\nI pray that you don‚Äôt have to reevaluate these opinions because you find out your child or parent is an addict. If you do, just know that we will accept you into our community. We will help your loved one. Do you know why we would do that? Because we are good people who just want the chance to live like everyone else.\nSo please, before you write another post bashing people who are suffering, think about it. Not only are you hurting the people who have the disease, you could be hurting everyone that loves them. You have people on your friends list or people that may overhear you at work who have children who are suffering right this moment from addiction. What did they do to deserve the awful things you put out into the universe that do nothing but perpetuate hate and judgment?\nYou have a right to your opinion. But no matter what, hurting people is wrong.",

    "selftext": " \n\nMany of you may have stumbled on the video of a 4 year old child (Mikey Cadena) which made the front page of reddit yesterday.  I‚Äôm not going to link to the video because it‚Äôs not the purpose of this post. For those of you who didn‚Äôt view it it‚Äôs a heart wrenching video taken in a court hallway where an innocent child is told by a social worker that the judge ruled that he is to be returned to his horribly abusive biological mother.  The cries that come from that child are indescribable, filled with terror and dread. \n\nAs my heart was breaking the only thought that was running through my mind was ‚ÄúIf something doesn‚Äôt change for this child he will one day be found in an alley with a needle in his arm‚Äù.  How else does one numb pain of this magnitude?  How do you grow up to be healthy productive member of a society that failed you?  I don‚Äôt think that any rational person would fault him if this were his future...but they do‚Ä¶ How often do we hear ‚ÄúAddiction is a choice YOU made the choice to start taking drugs.‚Äù I know I‚Äôm preaching to the choir here but it angers me so much to read comments directed at addicts demeaning them, shaming, blaming.  \n\nIt is widely recognized that addiction (and particularly opioid addiction) is directly related to trauma and pain.  To add pain to someone who is already suffering so deeply is simply inhumane yet it is acceptable.  You may be thinking to yourself ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt physically or sexually abused and I had a good childhood‚Ä¶‚Äù If you find yourself in that position look deeper.  Pain comes in many forms.  Were you yelled at by a parent and learned to stuff your feelings never sharing and fully trusting the adults in your life?  Were your emotional needs met as a child? Did you ever feel abandoned? Do you suffer from untreated depression or anxiety? Pain is pain. It is not a contest to see who has suffered the most.  If one drowns only in 2 inches of water is it any less traumatic than drowning in an ocean?  The end result is still the same, as it is with addiction. \n\nIdentifying and addressing the root cause of one‚Äôs addiction is the only way that we can free ourselves from it‚Äôs grasp.  The strength that it takes it do this is indescribable.  Those of you in recovery I hope you know that you realize how strong you are to be doing what you are doing.  Those who are struggling I hope you find the strength that I believe is within you to start the process. \n\nSending out all the love and strength that I can muster to you all. ",

I had a 100g per day habit on Kratom with equilivent liters of Codeine and lived for my fix. I have also struggled with full-blown alcoholism for over seven years and spent much of my twenties stoned on pot constantly. Tomorrow is my first-month Alcohol-free, and my Cannabis use has leveled out to an average of twice per week, although I desire to push it further. In two months, I celebrate two years free of the chains of opiates without any methadone or subs. \n\nI had to experience a visceral living hell to get here. For anyone coming off junk, know that as hideous as the first few months without opiates are, life does and can get better! I once never believed I would stop being high on opiates, I loved them more than all other drugs combined. Despite only having a nine-month habit, it destroyed me as both physically and psychologically I could not imagine life without opiates. Never give in, and never give up on yourself for there is always hope! I am not by any means perfect (still smoke Cannabis twice weekly and have struggled psychologically to motivate myself to burn trees much less) but my life is even better than the miserable shadow it was two years ago.",

    "selftext": "**EDIT: For the curious.... she's been found. She is in detox. The plan is rehab. She won't go to in-patient. Only out-patient. I don't know if she will actually go to it or she's just telling us what she thinks we want to hear. Either way, I'm happy she's safe (for now) and at least she'll get some food and a week or so of detoxing. Thanks again for everything. I check this thread often and the support and feedback you guys have shown is... it's amazing.**\n\nSigh. \n\nWe're back here again. We've lost you to your darkness, and no one knows how to entice you back to us. \n\nYou and I come from the same people. Literally. So does our other sister. The three of us were born of the same blood and raised the same ways. This is part of what makes it hard for me to understand how you have been pulled into this dark web so many time for so many years. \n\nI've been to meetings with you. I've heard the horror stories from other addicts childhoods and thought, \"this is not her life. This is not what made the addiction so powerful.\"  \n\nSo I'm left with the thought that it is purely a chemical thing. Something in you has caused you to spend (what some would argue) the most formidable years of your life (16-24) chasing a fix that would never satisfy. \n\nTwo years ago you suffered through something so unimaginable and horrible I thought for sure it was your \"rock bottom\". Following your release from the house you were held prisoner in... Following the arrest of the sick piece of living shit that raped you for a week straight and kept you pumped full of drugs... post all of that, you and I had a conversation. We sobbed and you told me your eyes were open. That you NEVER wanted to put yourself in a position like that again. \n\nAfter years of dropping everything to come to your rescue, THOUSANDS of dollars spent trying to help, our parents stepped up yet again, and put up the money (they took out a second mortgage on our house) to send you to that amazing facility in Colorado. \n\nYou stayed in Colorado for a year. You got clean. You got happy. You learned too much about yourself and about your addiction. We talked and you said things that you've never said before. There was a clarity in your eyes and in your thoughts that I haven't seen in years. \n\nAfter the year was up they offered you a job. You were so excited. You wanted to give back to others like yourself. You wanted to teach others how to find the sobriety you so desperately now held onto. \n\nThen, mysteriously, you were fired. We all worried. As was the pattern, you told us your firing was \"unfair\" and \"not your fault\". You said you wanted to leave Colorado and move home. \n\nEveryone told you to reconsider. Everyone told you that moving home was a risky move. You insisted. You promised it would be different. You regurgitated all of the things you learned in sobriety. \n\nYou were only home for 5 months when our sister found that needle in your room. You swore it was a tiny relapse. That you had it under control. \n\nA month later you got arrested. You BEGGED to go on Subutex. You said that if you were on that you could go back into your recovery. So our parents got you into the best doctor and got you an RX.\n\nYou stopped taking it as directed. Then you just stopped. \n\nIt's hard to know the finer details because I've been living across the country all this time. I only hear what Mom and Dad tell me. Or our sister. I only know that when I come home you're distant. I only know when we talk you swear that your recovery is going fine. \n\nThen I get a call last week. You're back in detox. From detox it's back to rehab. That amazing job you were so happy about last time we spoke... you got fired. \n\nThen I get another call. You've left rehab. You're missing. You're back on heroin. Again.\n\nI've been through every emotion. I've raged at you. I've become furious for everything you've put Mom and Dad through. I've been pissed because they cry and try and POUR THEIR HEARTS AND SOULS INTO YOU and you stare at them with empty eyes and a blank face. You look through them. All they've ever done was be supportive. Maybe even to a fault. You don't even thank them for what they've done to try and give you support and help. \n\nThe anger subsides and I feel guilty. Guilty that I ever smoked a bowl with you. Guilty that I screamed at you for something that I know is out of your complete control. I feel guilty because, at this point, I don't think I am as invested as I once was. \n\nIt's with this notion that the guilt turns to sadness. Sadness because I realize that my lack of investment stems from the sobering reality that you're running out of time, luck and options. Sadness because you're 25 in June and no longer can I say, \"she's a kid. If she gets sober she has so much time to set things right\".  Twenty-five is past college. I'm sad because every year you're not sober is another year of precious adult-life you're wasting. Sad because I have become resign to the three options that remain for you: Sobriety, Prison, or Death. \n\nI don't want you to die. I don't want you in prison. You're such a nice girl. You're my sister. My little Roo. We are so damn similar in so many ways that losing you feels like I've lost a piece of myself. Our sense of humor, our sardonic wit... Such a happy older brother I was when I realized one of my two younger sisters was going to turn out to be just like me in so many ways. \n\nNow it's like I don't even know you. I can't trust a word you say. This last year and a half you had us all fooled. We thought you came back from Colorado with confidence. With a bit of self control.  Then we find out that too was a lie. Then we find out that you've been using from the moment you got back home. That for the last YEAR AND A HALF YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING US IN THE EYE AND LYING! \n\nSo here we are. No one know where you went when you ran away from rehab. No one knows what you're doing right now. Are you alone? Is it scary? Are you too high to give a shit? Part of me hopes so. Do you miss me? I miss you. I miss your silly laugh and your stupid jokes. I miss you so fucking much it hurts so bad.\n\nPlease go back to rehab. Please don't die, alone, with some needle sticking out of your arm. Please don't die at all. Just go back to rehab. You know that moving back home isn't the answer. You need the help. I don't care if you have to stay in rehab the rest of your life. I want you to do whatever it takes to NOT DIE A JUNKIE! \n\nI'm hoarse from crying. My head is pounding from whirling around the thoughts of what's going to happen next. My heart skips a beat whenever mom or dad call, in fear that they're calling to tell me we've lost you for good. \n\nI don't know what else to do. We've said it all. We've screamed, yelled, hugged, fought, made up, cried, begged, pleaded, reasoned, grounded, threatened, and begged some more. \n\nThe only person left to help you, is you. Please do it soon. I don't know if I can handle putting you into the ground. I really don't think our sister could. You know her. She's weak and dainty. She's super smart but as sensitive as the princess and the pea. Shit, you know Mom too. We BOTH know she'll implode if she has to bury you. \n\nbut more than that there are SO MANY REASONS TO GET CLEAN AND LIVE LIFE: \n\nlove, happiness, loss, awesome TV shows, McRibs, ska music, The Reel Big Fish, water parks, babies, babies laughing, Archer, having kids of your own, having amazing sex (with other people, not with me you weirdo!), so that I can share my success with you, so that you can share your success with us, because it's what Gey and Poppy wanted, because of Mom and Dad, because the world is actually a pretty cool place, to travel, to see the end of a rainbow (it's there, we can find it together), to hurt together and heal together. To be a family again...\n\nOkay. I'm at work and I'm crying so much I can't really see clearly anymore. I also think people are staring. Please come home. Please get clean. I don't care that you relapse. I don't care if you relapse a million more times. I care that you've stopped trying to get clean. i care that it appears you've given up. \n\nI love you. I miss you. Be safe, little roo-ha. \n\n\nWith More Love Than All The Atoms in the Universe, \n\nYour Brother. ",

I turn on the shower to try and drown out the heaves from waking my alcoholic mom. My eyes are spewing tears, and the back of my throat burns as i wretch. My stomach feels like it‚Äôs being plunged. My poor, empty stomach. I stick my fingers down my throat, determined to get this daily side quest over with. Finally, my spine curls up like a scared cat, and i gag out just enough bile to calm my stomach.  It‚Äôs  5am‚Ä¶i have to be at the methadone clinic at 7 am for my 80mg dose.  I turn off the decoy shower and slink into the living room to where my pull out coach bed is. I put on a pair of board shorts and a shirt, and out the door, i go into the early morning sunrise of lahaina. My flip flops thunk down the stairs  as i make way down the yellow brick road.\n\nI can still hear the birds their calls were so ethereal in that time in between darkness and light. I reach front street.  I see the ocean with all its splender. For a second, i appreciate the beauty. Then, a wave of naseau hits me. Im at the second stop of my daily quest.  This is where i dryheave some more with the rising sun on a island in the middle of the fucking pacific ocean. My snot and tears are washed into the blue warm water. I hurl over and over. Tears are cascading down my face i am crying for real. I am crying and lauging at the irony of being so miserable in paradise.  One last wrectch and im good go. My daily quest continues.\n\nI reach the liquour store its 5:45am. There is a line of other booze hounds shaking and making pointing getures to the poison they want.  my turn, i reach into my pocket and gingerly grab a handful of change i have been collecting. Shakingly, i drop the change on the counter. She knows it‚Äôs a few cents short it always is.  She hands me a pint of taka vodka with a look of sadness and then forces a smile and says her usual ‚Äúmahalo.‚Äù I genuinely smile and reply ‚Äúsorry‚Äù i was sorry for making her see me every day, slowly getting thinner and sicker. I walk outside, unscrew the bottle as i walk to the bustsop, and take a gag of vodka down. I force my mouth shut and use jedi mind tricks not to vomit.  I can feel the vodka move down my esophagus into my stomach. I sigh and take another as a warm, familiar feeling grows inside me.\n\nI reach the bus stop with 3 minutes to spare, i sit on the stairs and take another gag of vodka and watch the productive members of society socialize and act alien like me. I might as well be on another planet. I get my tiny ass on the bus. With the feeling of wanting to vomit hits again i stick my head against my balled up sweater and make a pillow and let the maui transportation AC hit me in the face like a long lost love who returned from war 15 years after it ended.  I stare out the window as the bright blue beaches pass me by like a postcard. I close my eyes and dream of being at the bottom of the ocean. So peaceful. So beautiful.\n\nThe bus driver wakes me from my dream. Im pissed and snot is running down my face. It‚Äôs 6:30 i have arrived at my stop at the wailuku mall. I exit the bus, and the hot, humid air slaps me in the face like an ex you know is cheating on you, and she slaps you after you accuse her. Asshole.  I start power walking for the next 1.2 miles. As i walk, i unscrew my pint and take a gulp and howl into the hawaiian sun as it burns my throat. I walk through the maui community college campus sweating,pale,gaunt, and deranged. I reach the jack in the box. Finally, i ask for ice water and dump half on my head and chew on the ice cubes. I can see the building.\n\nI reach the building. It‚Äôs 6:55am. There‚Äôs a group of addicts ahead of me waiting in line to get dosed.  The guy in front of me becomes my boss eventually. I reach the window, tell em my name, and scribble it down. They put the methadone wafer in a small dixie cup and mix it up. I grab it and gulp it down. Say maholo and walk out  the door. My snot is already gone, and my eyes are dry. I sense that euphoria hits me, and the walk and bus ride back is 100% better. Everything screams. it‚Äôs going to be okay, evan\n\nI did this for a year until i got arrested and had to cold turkey in jail along with booze, in maui county correections.\nThats a whole other story.\n\n\n",

    "selftext": "so i guess i just need to rant because i‚Äôm kind of freaking out about what happened. i‚Äôve been in treatment for a little over a month and there‚Äôs a guy who works here who‚Äôs a couple years older than me. we‚Äôve been flirting on and off jokingly, he has a girlfriend and a kid so i didn‚Äôt think anything of it.  last night we were texting about random shit, and he asked me to come downstairs where there are no cameras, he told me to be quiet and to shut the doors quietly. we ended up hooking up(sorry tmi only oral we didn‚Äôt go further than that) . i don‚Äôt want to get him in trouble or anything but he works almost every single day so i‚Äôm going to have to see him. i don‚Äôt even know how i could talk to my sponsor about this, or anyone for that matter. i do not want him to get in trouble. it all happened so fast that i‚Äôm still processing all of this, i‚Äôm only 36 days sober so my emotions are super sensitive. i‚Äôm hoping writing this down will help me get it off my chest lol\n\n\nupdate: i told one of the other clients about this and when i meet with my sponsor i will tell her. i‚Äôm scared as hell i‚Äôll get kicked out for this. if i ended up on the streets i won‚Äôt be able to stay sober. i have recovered the text that he told me to delete. i understand that there‚Äôs a bigger picture to this and it would kill me if someone else went through this. this happened on monday night and i can‚Äôt stop thinking about it and i hate it. i‚Äôm not able to process it in groups yet. i don‚Äôt think i was groomed, i don‚Äôt see this as abuse because i consented, but i understand seeing it from the medical standpoint of him having authority as a tech and i am a patient. thank you guys for helping me see this in a different way, i wasn‚Äôt thinking of others. will update again on what happens.",

    "selftext": "Long time lurker, first time poster. 1 month 16 days clean from a monster fent addiction. Grateful to be on this side of the dirt and be a part of this community. \n\nI arrived last night to my apartment where I live with my college best friends, after having lived with my parents for the last month after treatment. A commitment to sobriety at tender age of 21. Going up the stairs to my floor, it was such a routine feeling. A trip I had made many times before while sick and nose dripping, layers of clothes and sweat in my hairline, on my way back up from the dope-man‚Äôs car. This time was different, I felt renewed and healthy. With a bounce in my step, I felt lucid. I was met with many ‚Äúyou look great!‚Äù-type comments. I was met with a sense of normalcy. Being able to look my friends in the EYES while I talk to them because I am no longer too high with a glassy look to do so, not nodding off mid conversation. I feel empowered. My sparkle is back.\n\nToday, I accidentally found a wax-sealed bag of dope, deep in my drawer, unopened and inviting me just once more. Here comes a very real sense of heartbreak. My old friend. The one who kept me warm during the bad and lonely nights. The friend who stuck by my side, was always available for me, and knew just how to cheer me up. \n\nI held that bag in my hands for ten minutes, going back and forth with myself. ‚ÄúJust once more, who would it hurt? Who has to know?‚Äù\nI started to cry. What a manipulative bitch opiates are. \nThe friend who made me sell my body in order to keep them around. A pimp that doesn‚Äôt have a payroll. The friend who constantly has to have my attention, there is no more ‚Äúme‚Äù time, there is no more ‚Äúme‚Äù. The needy friend who purposely takes me away from those who love me the most, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need anyone but me‚Äù ‚ÄúIt's me and you against the world\". What a manipulative bitch opiates are. \n\nI flushed it, after much hesitation of course. Bye bye, old friend. The worst friend. I sat on the floor for an hour afterwards with a lonely feeling in my chest. This was an emptiness similar to when you‚Äôre all by yourself after the end of a great trip with friends, the silence is unfamiliar, and it simply doesn‚Äôt feel natural. But soon it will feel normal. \n\nIt‚Äôs me against the world. Today, I choose me. Today, I choose sobriety.",

He has been microdosing suboxone since last Saturday (was still using during that time) and is taking several prescribed comfort meds. So far his symptoms and cravings have been manageable and I'm cautiously optimistic that he can stay clean this time (first time he has tried getting off with MAT). Two tips we learned in the last few days: Hyland's Restless Leg tablets and an acupressure mat are doing wonders to help with the crawling skin sensations. Just thought I'd share since I've been reading that this is one of the most annoying/uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms. Fingers crossed I can make more progress posts about his experience. Good luck to any of you reading this who are trying to get off this stuff.\n\nUpdate: Almost 30 hours with no fentanyl and it's continuing to go better than expected. Even made it out of the house for a walk this morning.",

I can't believe I'm sitting here with heroin in my purse knowing how much it ruined my life and thinking about the friends and family that didn't get a chance to win this battle are probably looking down on me so disappointed..... I'm tempted to flush the rest of this bag just to give myself a boost in the right direction and so that I know that I'm in control.... any advice on mentally kicking heroins ass, I have been through way worse dope sicknesses in my past so I know I will probably just have to sweat this out and will be a little nauseated but mentally I am not as strong as I'd like to think...... praying for anyone and everyone dealing with this addiction... you truly have no idea unless you have been through it so help would be greatly appreciated üôè I don't have many people I can talk to about my relapse and the only who knows is my boyfriend",

    "selftext": "   \n*If I'm ever having cravings or thoughts about throwing my recovery away just so I can get a good nod, I look to this little story I wrote about my days of chasing dope and going on never ending drug runs. If anyone is thinking about throwing their sobriety away, maybe give this a read.*\n\nIt‚Äôs 11AM and I'm dopesick. I'm picking up homegirl who‚Äôs about a 15 minute drive from my place. I call her and let her know I'm outside. It takes her 20 minutes to come outside and get in the car.\n\nI've already got 35 minutes invested into this dope run and it‚Äôs barely just started. I strap in and prepare for a long ride.\n\nI ask her where we‚Äôre going so I can enter it into my GPS. She tells me to hold on, gets out her phone, and makes a call.\n\nBeing na√Øve about what she‚Äôs doing or who she‚Äôs calling, I assume she‚Äôs calling her connect so see where the meetup spot is. No worries. It‚Äôs always good to plan this stuff, right?\n\nBut that‚Äôs not what she‚Äôs doing...\n\nShe‚Äôs actually calling around to see *where* we can get something. She doesn‚Äôt even *know* where we‚Äôre getting it from. I thought she had this lined up.\n\nHer plugs don‚Äôt answer. So we sit there while she makes calls and texts people. Decades of addiction have resulted in the decline of her mental faculties; It takes her 90 minutes to complete what would take anyone else 20...\n\nMeanwhile, I‚Äôm sweating it out over here, dopesick out of my mind.\n\n‚ÄúMy homeboy knows where to get it‚Äù, she suddenly says. I put the address in my GPS.\n\n‚Ä¶.35 minutes away....\n\n2 hours and 15 minutes invested so far‚Ä¶.\n\nWe drive the 35 minutes to homeboy's house. She calls him and tells him we're outside. He tells her he'll be right out. So we wait.\n\nAnd wait.\n\nAnd wait.\n\nAnd keep on waiting.\n\nAfter twenty minutes, he comes out and gets in the backseat of my car.\n\nBest way to describe him: The embodiment of how the system routinely fails addicts...He‚Äôs tatted up, institutionalized, and hardened. Look at him wrong, and an all out prison-esque brawl is likely to ensue.\n\nHomeboy tells you to drive up the street. You‚Äôre thinking ‚ÄúOkay, we‚Äôve already been at it nearly three hours. Clearly we‚Äôre driving right to the dopeman and this nightmare is almost over‚Äù\n\nSpoiler alert: It's not close to over.\n\nI get where he told me to go. Luckily, this was just up the street. It‚Äôs a liquor store. He walks in and comes out with a bottle of vodka, gets back in your car, and tells me to drive.\n\nYup. Unbeknownst to me, I've suddenly become chauffeur to this random ex con. That's funny, I don‚Äôt remember putting an ad in the paper‚Ä¶.\n\nAt this point, I'm over two hours in, so I say ‚ÄúHey guys? Where are going to get this and how long is it gonna take?‚Äù\n\nHomegirl says ‚ÄúDude, you asking too many questions. That‚Äôs some cop stuff man\"\n\nHomeboy agrees ‚ÄúYo dude don't be sketching me out with all these questions--you sound like a cop. You look like one too, so chill.\"\n\nBecause apparently saying ‚ÄúWhere are we going and how long is it gonna take to finally get what I came here for?‚Äù Is what cops do.\n\nAll I came to do was get dope. So far I've picked up Frick and Frack, drove to and from four different places, and took Frack to the liquor store...and now they're here dumbfounded that I have some questions.\n\nFinally, homeboy tells me to drive to a strip mall. It‚Äôs in the city. That‚Äôs gonna be 45 minutes away.\n\nI knew this wasn't gonna be easy...\n\nI finally get there. I began this dope run in the late hours of the morning and I'm starting to think that by the time it's done, the sun will be setting.\n\nOnce I park, homeboy says ‚ÄúAiight, gimme the money.‚Äù I give it to him. He gets out of the car, supposedly to go get the dope.\n\nThe insanity of handing money to someone I don‚Äôt know who also has a criminal record is trumped by my body‚Äôs desperate need to ingest opiates. It‚Äôs a risk I'll take for the ultimate reward.\n\nHomeboy hasn‚Äôt come back for about 40 minutes...It‚Äôs starting to sink in that maybe he probably took my money and walked off. Finally he shows back up. I get giddy. I have butterflies in my stomach. I've been dope sick all day, driving aimlessly at the direction of these guys for hours. I deserve this. I earned this.\n\nHe gets in the car and I can barely maintain my excitement but I'm able to keep my cool.\n\n‚ÄúSo, how‚Äôd it go? Where‚Äôs the dope?‚Äù\n\nHe says ‚ÄúDude wasn‚Äôt home. It‚Äôs a bust.‚Äù\n\n\\*sigh\\*\n\nTime to strap in. This is one of those never ending dope runs...",

    "selftext": "It‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve posted here. Life is going ever onward. I think less and less about my addictions than I ever thought possible. I haven‚Äôt touched alcohol in just as long. My head is clear, my thoughts are my own, and I have money in the bank. Life is good. \n\nThat last sentence was hard to say because it‚Äôs so unfamiliar to me. That thought even makes my eyes wet. I‚Äôve learned a lot on my journey to sobriety. Life being good doesn‚Äôt have to mean it‚Äôs perfect being chief among them. Perfection is impossible. And, good can look different for us all. \n\nI‚Äôve made peace with a lot of things. I‚Äôm forty one and single with no kids. And, that‚Äôs okay. I still have family and people that I love and care about that also love and care about me in return. There are times when I‚Äôm holding my six month old niece that I regret not getting to be a father. But, maybe it‚Äôs for the best that I‚Äôm not. Maybe it‚Äôs better that I don‚Äôt pass on my mental illness and addiction. I also don‚Äôt have a true career and I work an hourly job making a fifth of what my brother makes. That‚Äôs okay too. I don‚Äôt have the high stress and responsibility that he has either. I wouldn‚Äôt say that I‚Äôm happier than him, merely that I‚Äôm happier at would I do than I would be at what he does. I‚Äôm not young and nor am I immortal. Some day I will die. That‚Äôs okay as well. I‚Äôve lived, loved, and learned. My life has been and still is full. And facing my own mortality I begin to realize that when, not if, but when my body begins to fail that there may come a time when I‚Äôm ready to go. That too is okay. Youth fades. Time moves on. It‚Äôs not the quantity of life, but the quality of it. And my quality of life is better than it‚Äôs ever been. \n\nI struggle less with who I am. I like myself even. I‚Äôve found things I‚Äôm passionate about and that I deeply enjoy. I‚Äôve found I‚Äôm more social than I once thought I was. I‚Äôve also discovered that the things I once thought were impossible or had given up on are within reach. I can still go back to school and get a degree. I can one day buy a new car. I can one day own a home. I can forgive myself. I can be tender with myself. I can love myself. All of these are things that when I was at my lowest I thought were beyond my grasp. \n\nI‚Äôm not sure why I wrote this. Maybe I just wanted to order my thoughts. Whatever the reason I hope it helps someone in some way. Life can truly be better than you can imagine. You deserve another chance. You‚Äôre worth it. And, as cliche as it is...if I can do it then anyone can. Time was that I was as lost and as hopeless a soul that ever walked this earth.  But, time moves on and things can change for the better. It won‚Äôt always be easy. Lord knows I still have days where I feel overwhelmed and like a drowning man gasping for breath. But, those days are fewer and fewer. So, to whoever needs this please know and believe that it‚Äôs possible and that you‚Äôre worth it and that you deserve it.",

Prior you that I was being treated for back pain and that was when they were basically passing out scripts for pain meds like it was candy no questions asked!  So I was getting the basic 30 pills a month...I would break them in half and make them last a long time! I wasn't addicted at the time I don't believe! (Surely lying to myself but ya know) \n\nI lost my mom in 2009 to a rare form of thyroid cancer...I have ptsd from seeing her pass... It sucks. She was my best friend! That's when I realized I had a problem. I was trying to numb the pain and anxiety I had from losing my mom. I started running out of my medication rather than always having some left and I was taking the whole pill instead of half. I moved and started going to a different doctor and they upped me to 120 pills a month my first visit. Pain clinics weren't a thing yet! So you can see where this is going!\n\nI eventually had to go to a pain clinic to start getting my meds because of the opiate crisis. I peed dirty because I smoked some weed. So that ended that! \nIn 2015 I was diagnosed with breast cancer and had a double mastectomy (with reconstruction) to remove the cancer. So I was getting loads of pain medication for that. I thankfully didn't have to go through chemo or radiation. But that didn't last! \n\nI have been buying from my person for over 5 years now. I only buy from them... No where else because I know they are their scripts and shits scary out there! I can't even begin to calculate the amount of money I've spent.....ridiculous! \nNo one knows that I have this addiction(or maybe they do and just don't say anything)...I feel so alone! I just think if my mom was here I wouldn't be doing this. Not blaming my mom because it's my fault I couldn't handle losing here. She's was only 63.\n\nI am a 50 year old mom to a beautiful daughter that is starting high school this year and I feel like the biggest piece of shit! She deserves the best! I live in a nice house in a nice neighborhood. I pay my bills and have a job that I've been at for over 10 years!\n\nI'm on day 3 of wd from an 80mg a day oxy habit. I'm only taking Kratom and I'm uncomfortable and my brain hates me! I know I need to pay the piper since this was my choice but ugh!!  If you have any suggestions on how to make wd more manageable please share! I'm scared.\n\nI'm not sure why I posted this...I guess I just wanted to put it out there so I felt like I finally... After 11 years... Told someone! If you got this far... Thank you for reading!",

There where a couple times that I would have relapsed if I could but between not being able to find it, and wanting to be accountable to the person I told, I didn‚Äôt get any. I love you guys and hope you are doing well. Even if you feel like crap right now, that‚Äôs just your body getting well.",

I didn't want to say anything positive to where down the line she might have some interest stemming from me saying it's the best fucking feeling ever and I'd throw away anything to do it right now. that not true, but sometimes i lie to myself and forget all the bad parts of my relationship with heroin. \n\n\nIt made me think about my first time trying heroin though. I remember feeling very underwhelmed. Sure it was great, I felt amazing. I guess I had heard so much with it being very prevalent in my area, and so many stories and a lot of built up dreams of what it might feel like -just unimaginable pure ecstasy. It was very imaginable though. Warmth, comfort, and I fell in love. And isn't that what everyone wants? The basic human needs? Warmth, comfort, and love. And thats what's so scary about it- the feeling is very imaginable, what you crave , you can have. It may not be real love. But when you have nothing else, it's there for you. You might be freezing, but that hit will be there for you. I can close my eyes and feel it. \n\nIf I told my friend it felt comfortable and warm, who knows where it would have led her? Even if it was an innocent question, with no intent, just curiosity. \n\n\nI'm having a rough time right now. I have had a good month or so mentally and financially, staying completely clean of ALL drugs and alcohol this month(8 months sober from dope) depression is hitting and I'm having a hard time handling it. I am trying to convince myself that dope will not give me that comfort I am searching for. That there is no such thing as a quick fix to any real problem. And heroin isn't going to help me. I know this, it's just so hard. It's so hard to just keep going sometimes. It's so hard to have to Be Depressed. Even though I'm taking healthier approaches to taking care of it, it's so hard to have to go through it, and take the time instead of just taking a bump and letting it all melt away for just a little while. \nThat's all I have for tonight.

She was digging through the trash when it happened and called 911. A week later I found her again and she gave me the dope that kept the sickness away. \n\nAt twenty-five, she‚Äôs resilient. Dark hair cut short to her shoulders, down to tan tattooed arms that bore track marks and blade scars. Some self inflicted, others a part of a history I would never know. *These? Love letters from another life*, she‚Äôd say. The topic would change and we‚Äôd talk about anything else. But I‚Äôve heard whispers. Of how when she first arrived a John took her to a motel in Desert Hot Springs and kept her there for three days. When she came back, they said she didn‚Äôt speak for a month. In the sun you could still make out the ligature marks that snaked around her wrists and throat.\n\n*Hold this.*\n\nWe‚Äôre here, at the People‚Äôs Market on 5th and San Pedro. Gina slips inside as I hold her bag and wait under the overhang as the torrents that started the day before continue on endlessly with reports that the rest of the week would persist with heavy, unabating showers. I wonder what this city would look like under water. The summer sun barely breaking the surface of the icy whiteheads that crashed on to other shores. A city lost to the depths. Well, I think, I wouldn‚Äôt have Gina.\n\nShe taps my shoulder and holds up two bottles of Sprite Tropical. *Arc texted. He has Christmas presents.* I smile and take the bottles and continue on behind her. Nameless nobodies trailing boot marks against the  soaking concrete that fade in seconds, leaving no trace that we were ever even there. \n\n*Loman said the top floor‚Äôs open. They‚Äôre doing construction or some shit on some of the rooms but only during the day and the penthouse is unlocked.* We squat under the awning of the Primo Wholesale smoking the last of Gina‚Äôs Marlboro‚Äôs as Arcade grips the fading Jansport against his chest with his left arm. *He hooked us up. These key cards get us up. All the way up,* he said. \n\nArcade had lost his right arm to infection after a habit of reusing one hitters he shared with his wife who now lay buried somewhere outside the city limits. Years prior, he had lost his home and his daughter to Hurricane Katrina while he was deployed, scouring the scorched plains of Afghanistan for other men who knew the land and hid in its shadows.\n\n*I got all the gear right here but we need to get inside quick. I seen Jump Out Boys hawking the parks.* Gina and I look at each other and just as soon, we‚Äôre gone. Arcade leads the way as we pick up from behind, cold spiking our hands and legs and ribs. Above, thunderheads gather and watch over us like Holy Spirits. We‚Äôre flocking towards the glistening towers of downtown.\n\nFrom this height the world around us is a drowning pool of colored light and amber glow that bleeds up past the mountain peaks towards the ocean dark center of the sky. It‚Äôs warm here, the sounds of the feral city don‚Äôt make it past the 12th floor and all those ghosts that follow you leave at the door. This, I think, is what money buys. Stillness. \n\n*Arcade isn‚Äôt bummed is he? I was stupid.* Gina pushes the words out of her mouth like honey. I watch her in the low light of the work lamps that spot this place like cave torches, shooting angled shadows against the tarps and dry wall.\n\nWe‚Äôve been slumped now for four hours and the mood has shifted. Arcade blames Gina for bringing in what he calls ‚ÄòThe Fog‚Äô. This insidious, all encompassing fever that we were constantly on the run from, never stopping and never resting. It It had caught Arcade‚Äôs wife, Gina‚Äôs sister. Everyone we‚Äôd see one day and not the next. The Fog wasn‚Äôt sadness or fear or abhorrence. It was nothing. A void in thought and feeling that found its way into your veins in the aftermath of persistent, unwavering isolation. \n\nWhat she had said was to invite friends. Getting loaded on the top floor of the Ritz was a group activity, but after searching through our phones for 40 minutes in silence, we realized that no one was left. We were the only friends we had. I try and assure Gina who nods awake, her pupils pin point and giving way to the raw umber that shone like hot glass in the sun.\n\n*If we actually lived here. Shit, can you imagine?* Gina poses on the floor and I laugh. *Imagine all the dope we could buy.* Arcade sounds off. *Or we could pay someone to be our friend.* Gina‚Äôs voice is low as she gets up and stretches her arms above her head and along the backside of her ribs are clear marks I hadn‚Äôt seen before. I‚Äôd ask, but I know better. *Wouldn‚Äôt that be something? Paying someone to be there for you.* *Isn‚Äôt that what you get paid to do?* Arcade walks over.\n\n*Nobody would pay to spend time with me. They pay to screw me the way can‚Äôt with their wives. But a friend? They couldn‚Äôt betray you or steal from you or fuck you over. I mean yeah, you‚Äôd have to pay them, but you‚Äôd have a friend for life. Wouldn‚Äôt that be something*\n\nGina looks over at me and smiles and I wonder for a moment who she would have been in another life. A smiling woman on some distant planet, enjoying the warmth of other suns. Outside the rains cease and for a moment the world is quiet and still. I think about telling her about the man I met in an airport in Phoenix years ago. I stand next to her as she lays her head against my shoulder. I think better of it and say nothing at all as I feel her heart beat slow like a muffled drum. \n\nSix months later my cousin brought me to my parents house, staging an intervention and three months after that I got a call from Gina telling me Arcade had left for Detroit.\n\n*I‚Äôm proud of you. You have people who want to see you clean. I want to see you clean. You‚Äôre all I have left.* Gina said, her voice low. \n\nTwo months later I got the call. She‚Äôd been found face down in an apartment. She was alone. Toxicology showed combined effects of fentanyl and diazepam. The manner was accidental. Sometimes I conjure her in my dreams, her voice and dry humor still intact. Except she‚Äôs with people. Surrounded by friends who care about her, who could do more than I ever could. I see her, the room a bit more crowded than that night at the Ritz. Sometimes we talk, other times she barely notices me. But she‚Äôs there, talking to her friends, making connections. And above all. \n\nLiving.",

    "selftext": "It's so crazy that I'm even able to say something like this.üòÇBefore this, I never made it past a week or two tops. But this time it was totally different. I'm pretty sure I've shared my story in here before so I'll only do a quick summary..\n\nStarted using in 2008 due to an unexpected health condition & was prescribed percocet. Had NO clue you could even become dependent on them & potentially fuck your entire life up. But after being on them for several months & just cut off one day, I felt wds for the first time & Iegit thought I was dying. Went to the ER and everything (which as you know, they didn't help at all).\n\nAnyways, started buying them on the streets. Did that from 2009-2015ish. First OC 80s then switched to 30s when OPs came out. Then switched to heroin because of the price difference. Then to fentanyl & did that straight through until I got clean.\n\nI tried rehab, detox, and suboxone an embarrassing number of times throughout that entire decade & always relapsed. But I got pregnant unexpectedly and had my first child in 2019 and that's when everything changed. Me & my bf (my sons father) both stopped using together on the same day and took recovery seriously for the first time ever. We also both tried MAT and IOP for the first time ever and the combo of that & having our child is what got us to stop using. We now had someone that soley depended on us and in order to be the best mother & father possible, we had to change everything. And I literally mean basically every aspect of our lives. So that's exactly what we did.\n\nWe also used to do other drugs too and once I picked up a needle in 2016, I started shooting everything. But we haven't touched heroin, fent, coke, ketamine, molly, any rcs, & haven't even smoked weed in 2yrs now. Not that I consider weed a \"drug\" anyways but yeah.\n\nI'm currently 32 weeks pregnant now with another baby boy. And how we're looking at it as our first son got us to change our lives & stop using. And our second child is just another kick in the butt to make sure we stay clean. We went from being homeless living in my shit box of a car, lost my good paying job, no money, panhandling, lost all friends and family. To now we have a nice home for our family, a brand new car, money for everything our kids could ever want, $ in the bank, we're able to actually pay bills (and on time!), and I have the best family & friends support in the world.üíô\n\nSo for anyone out there struggling, just know its never too late to turn things around. If two hopeless junkies could do it while having used for a combined 26yrs straight (11yrs for me and 15 for him), then anyone can. It wasn't easy but its so beyond worth it.üòä",

So, I'm a graphic designer thats getting into UX design.  I absolutely do not like most of the recovery communities like AA or NA.  As a passion project I'm considering designing an app that could connect people(with the option to be anonymous) for the soul purpose of finding accountability buddies, and or finding people in your area to have your own meetings with.  Basically a refined version of what I see going on here sometimes and for people that are truly committed to their own form of recovery, for people that just cannot get onboard with traditional recovery ideas.  Any advice or ideas would be appreciated, or if you think it's a stupid waste of time.  LMK!  Thanks ya'll\n\nEdit: name ideas for the app would be most appreciated.  Something short and simple that represents unique approaches to recovery, and or the importance of the communal aspect and support.  I'm also thinking about a feature that would allow you to find people in your area so you can meet and make your own meeting.. of sorts.  However you wanna do it",

I'm not using currently, not even maintenance drugs. Ever since learning of my infection, I have worried and fretted about a painful death. I dont have insurance and live in a \"red\" state where Medicaid expansion has not happened. Needless to say, I cannot afford the $700 a month premiums for a half decent insurance policy. I've been stuck in this endless cycle of stress and worry for 2.5 years. That is until about 3 weeks ago. \n\nBy chance I \"met\" someone on another subreddit (the cirrhosis one or hepc one I dont remember) who has been nothing short of my miracle. They have informed me of and directed me to 340B facilities which will help those who need it. I've since seen a doctor 3 times and am now headed towards getting my hep C eradicated. I cannot describe to you the weight that has been lifted from me after I learned I'm going to get help with many aspects of my recovery process. These 340B clinics can help with housing, food, utilities, addiction treatment, etc also. This has the opportunity to be life altering for me. \n\nI write this to open up a dialogue with anyone who may be in a similar situation. If you have hep C and need help, please message me and I'll put you in contact with my new friend, and they will help find a 340B facility near you. Please dont wait until symptoms start showing like I did. With focused attention, we can get your virus treated before it effects your body dramatically. Message me and together we will face this stuff head on. Much love to you all.",

As someone who never cared that much about their birthday it's very strange to not be able to do anything on said date of birth when I finally have something to celebrate lol. I literally just got a job for the first time since August and thank god it's in a supermarket and I get to keep working when sadly everyone is losing there jobs. The state of things is very strange to me and more anxiety inducing then I ever could have imagined but I also am happy.. I am happy because I'm not sitting here sick worrying about not being able to hustle up a get well with 2 Dollars in my pocket. I'm so happy because my partner loves me again and I can give her the love she wanted so badly before. Today is a good day no matter what happens.",

    "title": "Letter to my boyfriend of over 6 years, who just confirmed to me that he's been using again for a few months.",
    "selftext": "Where do I even begin?\n\nMaybe I will start with my immediate feelings, which are paradoxical and a little troubling to me. When you told me the truth, and you suddenly seemed like a real human being to me again, someone feeling a fuller spectrum of emotions, having answers and not just a deer-in-the-headlights look on your face when I ask questions, acknowledging the damage done‚Ä¶I felt a startling sense of recognition and attraction. This was also the case a year ago in December‚Ä¶the realness of you, which I missed so much without being able to fully identify it. This is the person I fell in love with, this is who I am attracted to, this is why I have stayed, waiting and hoping to see this person again. On top of that strange feeling, there is the sense of relief‚Ä¶I am not crazy after all, there has been a reason for my anxiety, which I feel deeply and physically. Going back over the period of time you checked out and filling in many episodes that left me wondering feels good to my mental health. I have been fighting with you day and night in my head, while feeling a bit guilty for it, infinitely frustrated, and still trying my hardest to find any possible way to motivate you, to get you to come back on your own, without having to catch you. \n\nI need to stress the point that to me, at this point, the amount of time lying is the worst part. Of course I have had to live with the horrible expectation that you could relapse at any moment. But the hope is always that you would choose to lessen the trauma for me by telling me the truth immediately and not putting me through the exhaustion and confusion of trying to figure out why, little by little, you seem less and less like yourself. It is horrible to watch you nod off and deny it, to see you melting in front of a screen, with your mouth open and eyes half closed, to see you twitch and remember to fix your composure a little bit. But it is not only that, it is not only the moments of being visibly high‚Ä¶its the whole general feeling of that state. Maybe I can compare it to these shows we‚Äôve been watching in which someone‚Äôs body is taken over by an alien and then that person‚Äôs loved ones start to feel that this is not the same person and then try to figure out what happened and what to do about it. It is very difficult to describe the feeling of you not being you, but it‚Äôs such a distinct sensation‚Ä¶for example, its very difficult to really catch your attention. One vivid instance fo this was the day I tried to show you some pictures I had taken of the greenhouse. I watched your eyes glaze over the screen as you pretended to look. I could see you looking at yourself in the reflection of the screen, and not being able to really take in the pictures, and then you were quickly preoccupied with some texts, which were not urgent. The inability to listen, appreciate, focus, and the quickness to switch your attention to any new stimulus quickly becomes unbearable. And yet, there are other things that do catch your attention, like the endless political commentaries, which you are then eager to explain at length, pontificating. I do not want to be lectured, especially on subjects that have been exhausted in my opinion. I want to have real conversations, I want to be able to capture your attention. But I am so tired of trying.\n\nI said I was grateful about you being there for me through the abortion. I really am grateful. But now of course, I also feel very stupid. I tried to comfort myself with the thought that even though this was a horrible experience, and another painful December, at least this time around you were fully with me. But you weren‚Äôt. I am grateful for the part of you that was there. But I guess what did make a huge difference for me was the fact that I was generally stronger and more emotionally stable. This is the result of a lot of work, time, intention, patience and love towards myself. It is kind of crazy to think that I went through the procedure completely sober, without any opiate crutch whatsoever. I felt the fullness of physical and emotional pain, and yet you numb yourself on a regular basis, just to pass a regular Thursday afternoon. I have made the decision to feel fully, the good and bad. You have not made that decision. I cannot force you to do that, it is a scary thing‚Ä¶but of course it is not just pain and fear that can be felt fully, but also joy, satisfaction, creativity, love. For me, the intensity and frequency of these positive feelings greatly outweighs the unadulterated experience of sadness, uncertainty and disappointment‚Ä¶and I work everyday to make sure that I am increasing the opportunity for good feelings in my daily life. One of the scariest things about staying in a relationship with you is the thought that you  continue to choose not to to feel fully, either good or bad. And in the inevitable terrible moments of life, one of which we experienced in December, I do not want to be alone in feeling the fullness of tragedy. Nor do I want to be alone in feeling the fullness of something joyous, like the prospect of adopting a dog. \n\nI have to make it clear to you that for me, the deliberation about ending our relationship does not begin at the moment of confirming that you have relapsed. It beings when I start to feel like you are not really you. When I feel disconnected and unable to reach your core no matter how hard I try. You are right that I am not just going to suddenly pack my bags and get out. I do not have the energy for any such dramatic gesture. This is a painful and long process, the conclusion of such a long and important chapter in our lives. I also have unresolved business, like my passport and my healthcare which require me to have a stable address for now. But I have been forced to make alternative plans. I have been prompted to give serious thought and energy to the versions of my life that do not include you. It is confusing and painful for me to now suddenly have you back, disclosing truths, awake from your deep slumber. A part of me feels hope that we can just pick up where we left off before you checked out. Maybe you will want to stay forever this time around. Maybe you will have a quicker turnaround if you decide to check out again‚Ä¶But another part of me feels too exhausted in this version of my life‚Ä¶ready, terrified, and excited about what my life could look like next.

One of those years he was clean, and he was everything I‚Äôve been looking for in a partner.\nBut he relapsed just over a year ago, and has been abusing fent. \nI have done everything in my wheelhouse to help this man. I have babysat him so he can‚Äôt pick up, drove him to detox (which he fled from instantly) and unconditionally loved him. But‚Ä¶he has lied so many times, stolen from me, he disappears for days. He even let it slip that the place he uses/picks up from is a females apartment (which adds a new type of worry for me)\nAnyway, loving him this much is destroying me mentally and I need out of this relationship . I‚Äôve tried ultimatums but they end up with him promising me he will get clean, I believe him, and he does try, but ultimately goes back to using and that‚Äôs the cycle we have been on. It‚Äôs difficult to call him out on his using, and hold up my end of the ultimatum , because he will deny to the bitter end that he is using (even though it‚Äôs obvious) and make me feel guilty. \nI am holding on hope that he will get clean and we can restart, I just can‚Äôt do this when he‚Äôs like this, it‚Äôs too heartbreaking.\nHe begs me to stay and tells me he can‚Äôt get through this without my love. I know he‚Äôs struggling and that‚Äôs what makes this hard. So I‚Äôm looking for advice on how to end this in a way where he won‚Äôt take it so hard that he spirals. I‚Äôm almost thinking of just distancing myself as much as possible so it doesn‚Äôt feel like a huge ‚Äúbreak up‚Äù but is that cruel? If your partner has left you due to your addiction is there a way you wish they would have done it differently? Or even in a way that helped? He has nobody so I‚Äôm scared of walking away, but I think I have to. Just looking for some advice, and congrats to all you working on yourself and your sobriety!!",

Now I KNOW that sounds nuts, but I will say there is REAL HEALING POWER in psychedelics. \n\nDid our last shot of our last gram Friday evening then ate some acid. It hit pretty good...we had this transcendent sexual experience...well I did. Had probably the BEST orgasm of my life then this emotional wave just crashed over me and all the tears, grief, anger and sadness just poured out. O shook and cried for about 30 minutes.  My guy just held me through it. It was a HEALING release like I have never experienced or seen even as a former therapist. \n\nYou all know how powerful the mind is?  It is the MAIN driver in your withdrawal experience.  I was so afraid of kick week that my mind was putting me into withdrawal at 6am after banging a gram the day before ever kicking. But after the LSD, something happened to my mind. I truly believe that you gotta heal your soul wounds first, then your mind, and the body follows suit.  So I was determined to mind over matter my week of withdrawal. \n\nLast dope shot Friday evening then LSD. Saturday morning and no feelings of withdrawal yet. They start later and we got our cottons to take the edge off. 2  cotton shots Saturday and Sunday and MINIMAL withdrawal symptoms.  Monday is kinda day 3, minus the cottons.  My dude caved and got a gram. We shot it up immediately. Then hated ourselves. Then we made the choice to push harder.  So it really began Tuesday with no more cottons or dope. Mindset is good. Determined. \n\nGot ALL the comfort meds lined up on the table.  Robitussin with DXM, pepto, vitamins, ibuprofen,  gabapentin, Lyrica, tons of Xanax, antidepressants, mood stabilizers, ( im bipolar 1, severe according to my therapist) and a TENS machine.  You can get one for about $25. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this for the restless leg and back pain. Its a lifesaver! The RLS is the worst for me. And the anxiety and depression are crushing. They break me harder than anything. I will say this. Youtube guided meditations are the only thing that can calm my mind and body.  I can sleep away day 1, but after that sleep is MINIMAL. Guided sleep hypnosis meditations are so helpful.  \n\nFORCE yourself to get outside every day for at least a few minutes.  Force yourself to get your heart rate up for enough time to get your blood flowing stronger.  PUT YOUR BARE FEET ON THE DIRT AND GROUND YOUR FUCKING ANXIETY INTO THE EARTH!. IF you don't know what grounding your energy is, look it up. The earth releases electrons into your body. It balances your body's electric energy. \n\nHeal your soul, heal your mind, then your body will heal.  Listen to feel good music.  Watch movies that have a feel good vibe.  We discover the series \" The Expanse\" on prime. 5 seasons of badass sci-fi  space shit got us through until today and we have a few episodes left. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. \n\nSo hear I am, Sunday morning. Yes, I prayed so much this week. I prayed to Jesus, Mother Mary, great spirit, and Thor, Odin and Freya. Christian witch. Its interesting. My soul needs both.  Its ok whomever you pray to. Just surrender your heart and let the healing energy in. Its day 5. No withdrawal symptoms left but a bit of restlessness and minimal sleep. I stopped taking the comfort meds. Hubby started his subs again.  He needs them. 35 year addict. His receptors are shot.  \nI did not take and suboxone.  Fuck that shit too.. He is 50. I am 44. We are TOO OLD FOR THIS SHIIT and will die from it if we go back. I gotta be there for my son. He is my only reason. But a funny thing happened.  I have remembered I can have happiness again. Earth is a beautiful place to exist. Life is a gift. \n\nIf you read this far, thanks yo üôè‚ù§\nWriting helps me too. Sharing your story helps. I was an addiction counselor only 4 years ago. Relapse happens.  So what.  Push forward and heal your soul. Everything follows suit afterwards.  Much Love üíò  to all of you fighting this battle. Don't forget you are a fucking warrior and you CAN win this battle. ‚ù§üôèüçÑ‚òÆüïâüßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüåà",

I know it's better than shooting heroin every day and stealing and lying and doing nothing productive but technically I am still on a drug. The difference is, on methadone I am actually creating a healthy stable life for my family and I, and I am doing productive things. Can anyone relate? Advice? Thanks",

It‚Äôs been hell knowing that I need help but being unable to take action to get any.\n\nTonight my good friend agreed to take him in, though she‚Äôs 12 hours away in the area I grew up in. I could‚Äôve used the distance as another excuse to refuse to help myself and I very nearly did... but I didn‚Äôt. I booked an Amtrak ticket and decided to check into my old treatment facility that helped me a lot a few years ago as it‚Äôs in the same area and is a bigger facility with more resources than the ones where I live. \n\nSo I‚Äôll be on the train this time tomorrow, and in the facility in less than 48 hours. From detox I‚Äôm hoping for residential, and when that‚Äôs finished I‚Äôm going to be staying with that same friend who will have my cat for a while and do outpatient, and after that who knows. My future is completely up in the air and totally unsure, which is terrifying. The alternative, however, the future that I see for myself if I don‚Äôt make an effort to help myself (and FAST)... that is 100000x scarier than the unknown. \n\nBecause it is only a matter of time before I lose it all anyway if I keep going on this way- including, more than just possibly, my very life.\n\nIdk if anyone read this whole thing or cares... but if you do and if you can... pls keep me in your prayers.\n\nI‚Äôm very scared",

From one blue 30 a weekend, to 10 blues per day when I jumped. \n\nI just wanted to provide you guys with an update and some positive reassurance on this beautiful Tuesday. I know what it‚Äôs like to be scared to quit, simply because you don‚Äôt want to go through the withdrawal process, or because you want to time it up with a holiday or an extended amount of time you can have off of work. \n\nI just want you guys to know you should put your health over any job every time. Your job will replace you the second you fuck something up, your health is much more important. I‚Äôm glad I took the steps I did and took a couple weeks off of work to put myself first. At day 15 I am gradually sleeping more and more EVERY.SINGLE.NIGHT (6 hours last night). My energy is starting to restore as I continue to push my body beyond its current comfort limits. I started working out again, and my first day back to work was more productive than I‚Äôve been in the last couple of years being on those devil pills.\n\nI‚Äôm not overthinking about PAWS coming up in the future or any of that shit. Your mental approach to getting through this has so much to do with your success. We‚Äôre not supposed to feel great everyday as humans, we have good and bad days. So if you have a bad day don‚Äôt jump and contribute that to PAWS, it‚Äôs just a bad day. It‚Äôs actually good because it means you‚Äôre healing. \n\nI‚Äôm telling you guys if you want to quit, just do it and don‚Äôt wait for the perfect time. I went cold turkey from a 10/day fentanyl blue 30 habit without any subs, kratom, xans, or anything. JUST STRAIGHT OFF THE MUSCLE. End of the day you just have to want this shit. Use the pain as motivation to push hard so you never have to feel this way again. \n\nMuch love guys, if anyone needs someone to talk to just reach out. ‚ù§Ô∏èüí™üèª",

I saw his name and I felt his presence. That meant the absolute world to me.\n\nI finally feel like someone, somewhere is understanding that addiction is so much more than the stigma. I feel like I have more friends that I want to have remembrance stones put up for. I don't ever want to forget the people that I've lost and I will always be living for them.\n\nI am very grateful for my life now and the second chance that I was given to live.

I can‚Äôt stress enough how important it is to have a good support system when getting clean. To this day, I am still jamming my schedule full with work, school, and family just because I‚Äôm terrified of being by myself with nothing to do.\n\nTo anyone still struggling, trust me when I say that the grass is TRULY greener on the other side.

Got up to 20 pressed pills per day at my worst. Finally jumped on suboxone in September 2018 and jumped off that in June of last year.\n\nThese days, I can't say I'm feeling great, but no longer having to depend on opiates has been the most freeing experience I've ever had. No more sickness. No more worrying about running out or getting my supply. No having to hide anything from friends and coworkers. The constant anxiety is gone. I'm off the roller coaster. Life is just normal again.\n\nThe downside is my depression and fatigue haven't lifted yet. I routinely sleep 10+ hours per day and caffeine is the only thing that makes me functional. I'm also having trouble finding the energy to exercise at all. I've gained a considerable amount of weight in the past few months. Frankly, I've never felt this depressed, weak, tired, or unmotivated before in my life. The pandemic probably hasn't helped either.\n\nI finally went to the doctor for the first time in months last week and my blood test showed elevated liver enzyme (though not alarmingly high). That could be a factor in how I'm feeling as well. I'm getting more tests done. Who knows? Maybe I damaged my liver a bit while I used.\n\nI took off from working for several months last year to give myself time to fully recover. It was the right call, but finding a new job after that was really tough. Many employers passed on me because of the gap in my work history. It took hundreds of applications and months of interviewing, but I finally got something good back in January. It's a demanding role, which may also be contributing to my not-so-great mental state, but the company is in a solid place despite covid-19 and my job is secure. I'm one of the fortunate ones right now, and I don't take that for granted.\n\nOverall, it's been a mixed year. Some days are good, most are ok, and a few are really bad. However, I haven't used in a year. I can't believe I've come this far. In fact, I barely think about using anymore, and that feels like amazing progress.",

Fuck no it doesn't, that's my time.  I worked hard for it.  I haven't lost all those days because 1 day out of 365 I said fuck it.  I told my sponsor.  I surrendered and got another white key tag.  I thought I cleared all my reservations.  Apparently there was that one that got me.  Never again will I make that mistake.  \n\n\nIn the beginning it was hard of course.  Felt like there was a hole in me.  Absolutely nothing would fill that hole.  I ate a lot.  I gained 40 pounds in 6 months.  I went from being so full of energy on drugs, to practically immobile from the depression and PAWS of no drugs.  Fucking sucked.  \n\n\nFinally in November I decided to hit the gym.  And holy shit after a workout I felt high.  I felt like I could climb Mt Everest.  I was in the gym every day looking for that high.  I pushed myself and got it.  I was sore everywhere, but it felt amazing.  It's been 3 months in the gym daily.  I lost 20 pounds, but I'm fucking enormous, like a tank.  I feel bulletproof, invincible.  Maybe that's a bad thing but god damn fuck it I'm gonna keep going.\n\n\nI go to NA meetings twice a week.  I should probably go more.  My brain is still fucked up.  I'm aware of all my emotional issues.  I'm aware of my trust issues.  I'm aware of the fact that I am a real dickhead sometimes but I'm working on it.  NA has given me an insight into how I work.  NA has given me a network of people who get it and who I can vent all this crazy shit to.  NA has given me sober friends who truly care about me being the best me that I can.  And most of all, NA has given me accountability.  I've never had a problem letting myself down, disappointing myself, but I feel like if I use now, I'd be letting down a shit ton of people who want to see me stay clean.  If that's what helps me stay clean, I'll take it.\n\n\nWhat a wild ride the past year has been.  I feel like I'm truly free now.  Being alive is a privilege.  As shitty as it may get, it beats the alternative.  I'm going to use the time that I have wisely and make the most out of it.  I want to help others make it through.

    "title": "Saved a man's life today. Ten people walked past him, I knew what was up and helped him.",
    "selftext": "Me again. I'm the guy from Ireland whose family moved to Aus and had a tough time but got through it.\n\nHere's a TL;DR: found a guy overdosed and unresponsive. Searched him and found H and pregabalin. Tried to rouse him but was unable. Found out he's a terrorist. Called him an ambulance and was told I'd saved his life. Brain is flooded with so much natural dopamine I feel like I've just done a line of coke.\n\n***\n\nSo I was standing outside my office having a fag, when I notice a man slumped over on a bench in the park. I stand and watch him for a minute to see if he moves. When he doesn't move I go over to him and try and rouse him by saying \"hello, can you hear me? You need to wake up and stay with me and tell me what you've taken\".\n\nCouldn't rouse him. Searched his pockets and found a blister pack of pregabalin with 1500mg missing, as well as some bags of H. As I was searching him he roused slightly and muttered something unintelligible. Eventually I managed to get out of him that he had taken methadone, and he claimed he had taken no heroin but there's no way that's true since I'd found bags in his pocket while he was completely unresponsive.\n\nI'm from Ireland, and while trying to get information out of him I noticed he had a UVF tattoo. The UVF is a terrorist organisation in Northern Ireland. When I saw that I walked across the park and called him an ambulance. I mentioned the fact that he had taken 1,500mg of pregabalin, methadone and likely heroin so they sent an ambulance on blues and twos.\n\nUnfortunately the 999 responder asked me if I thought the patient was dangerous and I mentioned the UVF tattoo, so they also sent a police car. I was trying to only get an ambulance sent but due to his membership of a terrorist gang that has murdered countless people the 999 responder said they were going to send a team from the CTU (counter-terrorism unit). I felt bad for a bit but then I thought about how many people his gang has killed, how many kneecappings they've done etc. and felt much better about the CTU being there.\n\nThe paramedics from the ambo had a look at him and said I'd probably saved his life. They said that he's going to be getting help for his addiction, help with his living situation and help in leaving the UVF. They said that if I'd walked past him like everyone else he would have died.\n\n***\n\nI am 100% going to start carrying naloxone now. This is the third overdose I've seen in that park this week, but the previous two patients were responsive and cogent so I didn't hang around.\n\nAgain I don't want to humble brag but things just keep getting better for me. While I was searching him to find out what he took I could have so easily nicked his heroin and pregabalin but I didn't. Instead I sat with him for ten minutes to keep him awake, kept an eye on him while I was waiting for the ambulance arrived, and got a massive natural dopamine boost from saving a guy's life.\n\nI don't want to jinx myself but for some reason this time getting clean is different. Everything just seems to be going my way. At work I had a chat with my line manager about promotion, he said he thought I was already a senior software developer since in his opinion I've been doing the job of one basically straight out of uni (known the guy for three years). He's going to help me write my promotion application and he says it's basically a dead cert I'm getting it.\n\n***\n\nIt truly amazes me the level of c√¶city heroin causes. When I was shooting gear I thought that was all there was to life: go to work, earn money for heroin, get home, shoot heroin, repeat. I feel ashamed of myself when I think of the things I've said to drug counsellors.\n\nTo anyone struggling: always keep at the forefront of your mind the fact that you have changed how your brain works on a physical level, and that the marvel that is the human body will fix itself. You will feel like fucking Neo in the Matrix when you're operating at 100%.\n\nNow I remember why I had headhunters after me in final year at uni. Because I fucking kill at what I do. But for the years I was on heroin I was just doing the bare minimum. You will be amazed at what you're capable of.\n\nApologise for the massive post, it turns out flooding your brain with naturally produced dopamine induces stimposts just as much as speed or coke.",

    "title": "How heroin almost sent me to prison, again.",
    "selftext": "Yes, prison.  Many people ask me how a pretty face like mine fell down the rabbit hole of the system.  How a girl from a decent neighborhood wound up not only spending time in a county jail, but being shipped off to the penitentiary.  I feel like I am finally ready to tell my story.  My name is Megan, and I am addicted to Heroin.\n    If even one person relates to my story or if it helps anyone I will feel like it was not all for nothing.  So here we go.  Fair warning: this is not a nice story.  It's gritty, dark, and sometimes upsetting.  However, there is a silver lining in every dark cloud so bare with me.\n     I was about 5 years old when my mother told me my father was \"allergic\" to beer for the first time.  I have two older sisters who up until then fought to protect me from our awful truth that my father was an alcoholic, and an addict.  I would tell my friends and teachers elaborate tales of my father being in the army or that he worked at Disney Land when he would be absent for weeks at a time.  You never understand how someone could leave their children, ruin their own life for a drink or a substance.  I pray some of you never have to understand.\n     He would have periods of sobriety throughout our lives.  Eviction notices or a missing t.v. came like a slap in the face when you realize those periods of sobriety were periods of deception.  They would turn out to be periods where we were blinded by hope that things would finally be ok.  He was fighting for his life and all we could do was watch, and keep loving him.\n     I was 15 years old when I tried heroin for the first time.  I remember how cool I felt.  I wouldn't bother trying to cover my track marks in high school because I thought it made me a \"badass\".  My entire group of friends did dope, so it felt normal.  People also always needed me to get it for them and it made me feel important.  I have terrible anxiety and I had the choice to make it go away with one shot of that \"liquid gold\".\n     One of my older sisters was also an addict, so when the day came that I woke up with what I thought was \"the flu\", she knew what was really happening.  She told me to do some dope and see if I felt better, and I did.  Within seconds of it pumping through my veins it was like I was a different person.  The goosebumps, the sweat, the knots of cramps in my stomach, all gone in one second.\n     From then on I was in constant fear of running out of my medicine.  Yes, I called the killer drug that is heroin my medicine.  I stole from everyone I cared about.  I remember the look on my mothers face when she found out why her money or jewelry always came up missing.  \"I have done this too long with your father I will not go through this with you girls\".  Me and my sister tried to stay clean but heroin was now everywhere.  I had gotten almost every one of my friends hooked already, it was just too hard.\n     Highschool ended with me going to jail for the first time.  Drug possession and shoplifting.  My mom paid the $2,500 bond and took me straight from county jail to rehab.  My first go at rehab was a complete joke.  I didn't try at all.  Heroin had become my best friend, and anything in the way of that friendship was nothing I wanted to hear about.\n     I finally got discharged from probation unsuccessfully, but all I heard was that I was discharged.  I didn't care about the felony being stuck on my record.  It was the first, definitely not the last.  \n     I got clean for the first time shortly after.  I met the love of my life, the one man who has stuck by my side through everything and got pregnant.  I had to go to back to jail while pregnant for old warrants i didnt know i had.  After a little over a month my mom had come up with the 5 grand to get me out.  I followed the rules until I had my son.  I never used while pregnant, thank you god.\n     My son David was 6 months old when I relapsed, yet again.  I was 21 at the time.  My bond was forfeited when I never went back to court,  so my mom lost the money she put up to get me out.  I dove head first back into addiction.  I finally understood how my dad could leave us for a substance.  I sold my soul for heroin and did it with a smile on my face. \n     I had never been so depressed.  Instead of teaching my son to walk I was with girls who didn't care about me in run down hotels barely surviving. But hey, at least I had my heroin.  My sons father would beg me to come home.  He would come searching for me if he had the slightest idea where I was.\n     I was on the run a little over 2 years until the cops finally got me.  I had almost 40 bags of dope on me when I got picked up for my warrant.  The beautiful thing about Chicago is that I didn't get charged for the bags because one of the cops was clearly an addict himself and pocketed them.\n    My mom told me she couldn't pay another 5 grand so I sat.  I sat until illinois sentenced me to 1 year in the Department of Corrections.  I watched a woman hang herself my second week there.  I lived with women that killed children.  I lived with women that killed many people, sat across from them at breakfast.  The monsters you see on the news, I shared a toilet with.  \n     I remember sitting the night before my out date just thanking god that I had an out date.  So many women will never leave that place.  Some don't deserve to ever leave.\n     7 months of hell and I was released.  You would think being on parole and just enduring that type of madness would make you stay clean.  I got high after being out 5 days.  Again diving head first into the needle.  I went on a couple month long binges until one day I realised I'm too tired to continue on this path.\n     My son got me clean this time around.  He is now 3 years old, and he can finally ask me to please stay home.  Please dont leave me again.   He said that to me and it's like I got slapped in the face with a memory of me begging my own father to do the same thing.  He is one thing I love more then heroin.  It just took me a long time to see that it was effecting him.  Heroin has a way of making you justify your actions.  You don't realize how bad it's gotten until you lose everything. \n    I am listed as \"absconder\" from parole on the IDOC inmate search, which means on the run.  I prayed that I could keep my promise of staying home but there was one more thing I had to do.  I had to turn myself in to my parole officer.  I was in her office begging for my life when she set the cup to pee in on the table.  She told me you pass this drug test, you go home.  If you fail, your going back to Logan Correctional Center.  Because of my child I passed that drug test today.  \n     God gave me another chance.  Today my father has 6 years clean.  My older sister has 7 months.  I have 3 weeks and 2 days.  I am finally sleeping at night, and still have nightmares almost daily about relapsing.  The future is never certain, but just for today I am clean.  Thank you to my future husband, my parents, and most importantly my son for loving me until I could love myself. \n     God willing I will stay strong and win this fight.  If you or someone you know is struggling with addiction love them from a distance if you must, but please don't stop loving them.  I am always willing to talk or just listen if you have nobody.  Just muster up the strength to ask for help.\n\n/r/reditorsinrecovery \n/r/heroinaddiction \n/r/addiction \n\n/r/opiaterecovery",

This time I'm doing intensive outpatient treatment and I think that is making a big difference compared to the other two times. I stabilized about 3 weeks ago at 80mg and feel really good  I'm actually able to enjoy life and feel emotions and have dreams again and live a normal life. The other two times I did mmt I purposely got my dose as high as possible like 150-170mg just so I could nod all day then I would do benzos and cocaine on top of my dose and I did this daily until last November when I got kicked off the program and lost my daughter. I'm so determined to get her back I'll do whatever it takes i quit the benzos in June and it was HELL! but eventually after having multiple seizures and the worst w/d ever I got through it stopping cocaine was a breeze but the opiates we're hard since I suffer with chronic back pain and have been using for 12 years.  I decided that I would do mmt again since I despise suboxone because it keeps me awake and does nothing for pain and I figured I would need a program to go with mmt not only for myself but also to look good in family court so my daughter can stop living with my parents and be with me.  This has been awesome and I hope anyone thinking about trying mmt for their problem considers doing an outpatient program with it because it makes all the difference in keeping on the right path.  I hope someday I can help people who are living the struggle of addiction. ",

    "selftext": "I hear lots of people trying to get clean asking when will I feel better when will i be able to enjoy things again? I can sure remember what that feels like.\n\nIt was February of 1987 when I went for the third time to rehab. I was 36 years old and had first used heroin at 17. I had been on methadone maintenance for 6 years previously and as a result had horrendous withdrawal and post acute withdrawal. I struggled every day at rehab for 6 weeks.\n\nI got out of rehab and went to a recovery house and was still in bad shape. I had restless legs and anxiety constantly.  We had a TV there and HBO but I couldn't sit still to watch anything. \n\nThis lousy feeling dragged on. One day, in early May two guys at the recovery house asked if I wanted to walk with them across town to a girlfriends house. I said ok and tagged along.\n\nSo I was still really antsy but when I was there they turned on the TV and don't you know the Kentucky Derby was on and it was post time.  I watched the race and really enjoyed it.  I laughed to myself that I watched the only thing on TV that was only two minutes long  :) \n\nSo yeah Alysheba was the horse that won that race and I'll never forget it as the first bit of enjoyment I had. It was about 80 days out and things got better from there. \n\nI watched the Derby today as I almost always do.  I have certain things I try to always remember.  I've been drug free ever since then.\n\nSo yes, hang in there it does get better. Try to recognize those little victories along the way like the Kentucky Derby is for me. Remember them as they are the signs that you are on the right path.\n\nI'm 73 years old now and semi retired. I have a nice retirement home all  paid for. And i plan on doing some traveling.    It's been a great life.  Oh, and I have a wife and kids who have never seen me using.  I'm proud of that.\n\nBest of luck to all.",

    "selftext": "Tomorrow marks four weeks clean from all opioids and all hard drugs of any sort except pot. \n\nI‚Äôve tried to get clean probably a million fucking times. I got on suboxone back in august of last year and i feel like it really helped me learn how to live without drugs. \n\nI slipped up a hand full of times but i try and not guilt myself over the times i broke my streak as Id still learned a lot and still felt like i could really do it. \n\nI moved states and lost my online doctor so i knew it was time to really try and kick the habit. \nMy withdrawal symptoms weren‚Äôt too bad just mainly excessive sweating, fatigue, and restless arms with some insomnia. \n\nNow i‚Äôm to the point where i can get some good sleep and actually wake up at a decent time in the morning from all the restless mornings with insomnia. \n\nThe mental withdrawal and cravings have been pretty bad. Sometimes when i get the gears turning and thing about getting high it‚Äôs been hard to get them to stop. I try and keep busy constantly and avoid idle hands. practicing the guitar has really helped me as it‚Äôs something i really enjoy and also something that i feel like i‚Äôm achieving after dumping lots of time into it. When i think about getting high i try not and feel bad that i still want to get high and rather feel good about how i‚Äôve learned to cope, avoid, and live with those urges and take them at face value. \n\nI started work at a new job a week ago and i feel really good about it and it‚Äôs helped me keep busy. Now that i‚Äôm sober i actually feel good everyday and actually can enjoy being at work and getting shit done rather than try to get high to numb the burden that work used to put on me. I just strive to do my best and stay busy and it‚Äôs honestly been awesome that Im just happy and in a good mood normally. \n\nThis time it actually feels like being sober is possible. I genuinely want to enjoy life as is played out and i‚Äôm baffled at how much my outlook on life has changed in one month. \n\nI used to tell myself all the time that tomorrow was the day and that i‚Äôm sick of this shit and i just want it to end. but the next day the thought wouldn‚Äôt even cross my mind. I was getting high. It just genuinely felt impossible to get sober. \n\nBut now i‚Äôve gotten sober and i know deep down inside of me that it‚Äôs possible to stay sober. \n\nI still think about getting high all the time and it is definitely intimidating as i feel like i could fall off of the wagon at any moment. But i just keep telling myself that I WILL stay sober and that‚Äôs what i want with all of my being. I‚Äôve learned to deal with the cravings and choose not to act on them. \n\nI just feel really good about it and want someone that could share this same experience with me to vent to. \n\nAny words of wisdom and things you‚Äôve learned over the course of your sobriety would be greatly appreciated.",

I definitely fit the profile of a chronic relapser and I can‚Äôt say that I know exactly what triggers me to use. I‚Äôll have a couple months of clean time and then I wake up some how two weeks into active addiction. It‚Äôs almost like I don‚Äôt even use when I feel like shit I use when I feel any kind of emotion, positive or negative. I over dosed at the beginning of December and basically had to come clean to my girl. Before my last stint with blues put me in the hospital on a breathing tube and I couldn‚Äôt leave due to being marchmen acted. I swore that was it and then bam. I‚Äôm back on the shit . I realize that this is bigger than me and that if I‚Äôm willing to die TWICE for a high there must be something deeper going on.

Do what you have to until you feel comfortable enough to actually come clean with the pep you love and care about. It‚Äôs pretty shocking how much support is actually out there.

I also did a rapid 7day sub taper the first week(bought from a friend) to get through the worst, and then jumped cold turkey. \n\nThe first few years I got heavily involved in the program - went to meetings everyday, gave back by helping newcomers, fellowshipped with other recovering addicts regularly (going to dinner, baseball games, cookouts, etc.) Immersing myself in the program the first few years was crucial for me and gave me the solid foundation I needed to stay clean. \n\nPersonally, total abstinence was the only thing that worked in the long term for me to truly stay clean. I tried bartering with myself- ‚ÄúI‚Äôll only smoke weed‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôll only drink on weekends‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôll get clean by taking a bunch of psychedelics to come to the realization that I don‚Äôt need drugs‚Äù - crazy mental gymnastics I constantly used because I could not let go of escaping reality with mind altering substances.

    "title": "Illusions of Freedom: One Year Sober",
    "selftext": "Happy 4th of July to all my fellow Americans. And happy \"just another day in July\" to everyone else :)\n\nIn my case, freedom is both a choice and a constant battle. I guess you could say that's true for many instances of freedom, they're earned - but mine has no finish line. I will never cross a threshold and be rid of the poison that travels my veins. \n\nAddiction never really *goes away*, I will never truly be free. \n\nBut it does get easier as time erodes the obsession and cravings to use. And as that has happened I've been able to take on a new perception of myself, and the life I lead. \n\n I fought like hell for this half-assed version of freedom, and I'm finally in a place where I'm in control, and that's a massive victory. It's like I can let my guard down a little bit, but never too much. If and when I have thoughts of using I know how to combat them. I know how to disarm my mind and rationalize the reasons why I shouldn't crush up that line....\n\nEesh. \n\nJust writing that makes me miss it. *That's my truth.*\n\nAnd I'm proud of myself for recognizing that, and moving on. It's been almost a year and 2 weeks of sobriety, and I've learned a great deal about myself and about the process of letting go. There's many cycles, and it isn't easy to see everything for what it is when you're immersed in it - such as many things. But I've come to a point of clarity, likely because it's a significant milestone and I have been doing a lot of reflecting on my (long) time as a user, and my time sober from opiates. \n\nAnd I'd like to share some things I've learned when reflecting on my first 6 months of being sober. \n\n- Simply quitting or abstaining from using my drugs of choice fixed almost nothing, except my bank account. Nothing \"changed\" until I began recovery, started asking for help, and acknowledged that I had a lot of work to do on myself, and that the problem wasn't using, really. The problem was *why* I was using. And the fact is that it was my coping mechanism, my way out of dealing with life, and the only way I knew how to feel happiness. \n\n- There are a lot of miserable days. Tears. Shame. Guilt. Fear. And in the beginning it was really tough for me to make sense of where any of it was coming from. Everyone kept telling me how great I was doing, how I should be proud, and it made me feel like I was broken because I felt none of that. \n\n- I also learned life is not unbearable without prescription opiates. Some days it felt like that still, but most were okay\n\n- I started remembering who I was before the drugs gave me a different identity. \n\n- I began to truly experience my emotions again\n\n- Acknowledging, owning, and ultimately accepting responsibility for my behaviors, choices, actions and words when I was an active user was crucial to moving forward. \n\n- I transitioned from a completely self-centered state of mind to being aware and sensitive to the needs and emotions of others. I am still practicing this, it has been challenging for me to step outside my own perception and hear/see things in the way someone else does. \n\n- I missed the relationship I had with opiates. Someone here compared the beginning stages of sobriety to losing someone you care for deeply. It felt exactly like that, I would describe myself as feeling incomplete, lost and alone for the first few months. \n\n- Holidays were really tough for me, along with other things. I began learning what my triggers were and doing what I could to prepare and minimize risk if possible. The decision to be sober takes planning and commitment on level I didn't think I had in me, but I just kept at it one day at a time. \n\n- Staying sober was my main priority in life during those first 6 months\n\nAnd in closing, something I've learned more recently is that I'm the happiest I've ever been in my life, and after using for almost my whole adult life (in one capacity or another) I can safely say that that is no coincidence. \n\nLet freedom ring, bitches ü§ò\n\n*\"Greater in battle than the man who would conquer a thousand-thousand men, is he who would conquer just one - himself\" (Buddha)*\n\nEdit: I added this quote because I love it, but I realized it's worth clarifying that I'm female.",

I know this is counter to what many suggest here, but honestly i'm so, so, so glad I did. It made the acute recovery process hurt a lot more than it could have, but that pain becomes a very strong tool moving forward. Additionally, and most importantly it was the desire to be totally clean and free from substance that ultimately made me decide not to pursue Suboxone or other aids. I'm very glad my doctor wouldn't prescribe it until I had been clean for a full week. \n\nAlso, be as active as you possibly can be. This is easier said than done but there is a reason so many people suggest it. It accellerates the healing process immensely. Just going for a walk, anything to get yourself moving.\n\nInitially, finding a way to burn time and keep yourself occupied from whatever agony you're experiencing. For some that's video games or a hobby. I found that watching television really didn't work because it wasn't engaging my attention.\n\nLonger term, after acute phase, I found that staying active as much as possible really helps. This isn't difficult for some people who work regular jobs or have families as you're forced into action. Do as much as you can as often as you can. Exhaust yourself.\n\nIn the future, months down the line, you'll start feeling pretty good and it is at this point where the most dangerous temptation comes. You're in a better space and feel like you could possibly have another dance. Step back and recognize that moment as one of your final tests.

They both turn you into shells of your true self, Ive been through the cycle a few times and getting off subs was the worse by far. This is NOT medical advice and you should always talk to your doctor and/or therapist before taking anything new. This guide is based on research and personal experience. I hope it helps even just one person make it through withdrawals.  I will not put sources for anything but a PM could help, most of this stuff is on‚Ä¶. I will try and put a proper dosage for the items, but everyone is different and some stuff doesn‚Äôt work at all for some but is a wonder drug to others. I do not know the science behind some of this stuff so ill keep the descriptions and what they help with in regard to the w/d‚Äôs themselves. Also get a gemini-20 scale or any scale that measures mg‚Äôs. If you want to be done with the cycle of drugs, then take 2 weeks off work if you can afford it. Make up any excuse like my Aunt is sick in another state. If you cannot afford to miss work, then use these drugs to help you beat w/d. Remember this is only meant to get you through the first 2 weeks. In my experience I am physically back to normal after day 4.\n\nDrink lots of liquids, root beer and ginger ale can help settle your stomach. Tea can help you relax.\nI know its hard to think of food but even just some soup or saltine crackers will help you feel better. Also, chocolate is awesome.\nMusic, Music, Music\nShowers obviously help a lot \nSwimming, walking, riding a bike\nOrgasm OFTEN!\n\nZMA- \nThese are good for RLS and help sleep a bit. They contain magnesium, zinc and vitamin b6. Take 3 before bed. \n\nL-Theanine-\nCalms your nerves, weak but nice when combined with coffee.\n\n\nLemon Balm \nI prefer the powdered form since its much more cost effective. They have it in liquid form too. This helps with nerves and sleep.\n\nPassion flower\nEither liquid or powder. Helps with nerves and sleep\n\nPhenibut and F-Phenibut\nThese are great drugs to use but only use them 3 days in a row at MOST. BE CAREFUL not to get addicted to them because the w/d‚Äôs are worse than the opiate ones. Phenibut is more enjoyable but it takes at least 2 hours to kick in but lasts awhile. F-Phenibut is stronger and faster acting but the effects are not as fun. F-phenibut is safer imo because the tolerance develops slower and the w/d‚Äôs are not as bad. TAKE THESE FOR YOUR FIRST 2 or 3 days of w/d then stop. DO YOUR RESEARCH BEFORE TAKING THESE.\n\nCyclazodone \nIf you have access to this stimulant and its better cousin N-Methyl-Cyclazodone from a well known vendor then get it. Use it 3x a week at most to help with energy and focus. This is the best legal stimulant I have tried. Just be careful and do NOT take more than 3x a week.\n\nKratom\nOkay this drug saved me but it also has a darker side. I‚Äôm currently trying to taper down and quit altogether. This is a much better option than opiates (Heroin, oxy, Vikes) and traditional maintenance drugs like Methadone and Suboxone. Just be careful and know that it is addictive and also has withdrawal symptoms that can be pretty harsh.\n\nBenzos\nI know benzos are terrible for us and the w/d‚Äôs can kill you but if you can find legal ones such as diclaz, you can use it for the first 3 or so nights but no more than that. \n\n\nDoctor meds. All depends on the doc, some will give you 90 percs, 90 zans and 90 addys while others will give you trazadone. If your upfront with him/her about you wanting to get off opiates but can‚Äôt/wont go to rehab or go on suboxone or methadone chances are they‚Äôll give you some meds to help with the w/d. Here are some Dr meds that are very possible to get.\n\nClonidine- Very helpful drug that helps sleep, temperature regulation and overall relaxation.\n\nGabapentin- A must if you know your about to detox, take them after eating a fatty meal with soda. I don‚Äôt know why but they work better that way. Helps with RLS, aches, anxiety and sleep\nLyrica- Depending on who you ask a better version of Gabapentin or a worse. I found it is better because it has a higher bioavailability. Helps with RLS, aches, anxiety and sleep. Probably hard to get from a regular doctor.\n\nOndansetron(Zofran)- This is the best stomach medicine I have ever used. It helps with diarrhea and nausea almost instantly.\n\nSimulants (Adderall, Ritalin, Concerta, Modafinil) The devastating laziness that comes with w/d is imo the hardest to deal with. So, if you can use any of this short term you should.\n\n\n\nWeed and CBD- I have not had weed in years (I‚Äôm glad its legal but I get super paranoid) but I can‚Äôt imagine weed not helping if you already smoke. CBD is nice, it lets you relax, stops minor pains, helps anxiety and promotes good sleep. CBD is not going to knock you out with its effects they are subtle.\n\nDXM- Okay this might sound crazy and dangerous but DXM at low doses for the first week felt like it really helped. 12-16 caps of the 30mg for 3 or 4 days. Or 36ml of the liquid.\n\nThey have several nootropic sites out there that have tons of stuff that could help addicts in recovery. This is just for the initial fear of an addict of w/d, when it‚Äôs not that bad if you plan ahead.\n\nI have several nootropic store links that are legit.\nHope this helps",

    "title": "Scariest experiece of my life - two hours in hell (precipitated withdrawal experience)",
    "selftext": "I just posted this on r/drugs and thought that you guys might enjoy it too.\n\nThis is going to be a very strange, unique (and long) story, so please bear with me. But I promise it's an interesting/bizzare experience report worth reading.\n\nQuick backstory. Over the past several years I have developed a MAJOR oxycodone habit. We're talking 350 - 370mg per day, divided into 60-70mg doses taken every three hours from the moment I wake up to the moment I go to sleep.\n\nUnfortunately, after years  I finally ran into supply issues mainly due  to corona. This meant that  I had to cut back SIGNIFICANTLY over the past week, reducing my daily dose by more than 75%. Obviously, it's been painful, but managable so far.\n\nThat all changed yesterday at night. I knew I had a bunch of Targin pills (40mg oxy/20mg naloxone) in my posession, but in the past I could never find a way to take them without giving myself precipitated withdrawal. I get precipitated WD even if I take 1 uncrushed Targin pill orally! I guess I'm just way more sensitive to oral naloxone than most people.\n\nBut being in a desparate situation with my stash dwindling fast, I decided to try to experiment with   them again. I read online that the melting point of naloxone (when it turns from solid to liquid) is around 200C while for oxycodone hydrochloride it's somewhere between 220-270C. So I got a brilliant idea. What if I set my oven to 210C and put the targin pill inside to get rid of the naloxone, leaving behind just oxycodone?\n\nI decided to use half of a pill, so around 20mg oxy/10mg naloxone. As soon as I put the pill in the oven it started to release a liquid and sizzle. I thought, hey it's actually working! However, after about 2   minutes in the oven the pill turned into this caramel-like stretchy brown goo which quickly turned hard. It looked weird, but when I re-weighed the leftover amount the mass of the pill dropped by how much I would expect it to drop if the naloxone got removed from it.\n\nSo I proceeded to eat (chew into pieces) the resulting hard, brown caramel-like substance. Some small pieces broke off when I was putting it on the scale, so to get them into my mouth I pressed my thumb against the digital scale a few times (this will turn to be significant later) to get them to stick to my thumb and then I put them in my mouth.\n\nAt that point, I had no idea that I just bought a fast-lane ticket to hell and had it stamped. At worst I thought I would get a bit of precipitated withdrawal like before when I tried to take Targin, or it wouldn't do anything. Boy, I was SO, SO, SO incredibly wrong.\n\nAfter 20 minutes, my stomach begins to hurt and I immediately rush to the bathroom. I sit down on the toilet and within minutes, something  weird is happening to me. The best way to describe it is as if my blood was suddenly replaced by ice water. I felt the MOST INTENSE chills and I started sweating profusely at the same time. I also felt nauseous. But that was only the beginning of the ride. Next, I feel my mind start to slip (anyone who has taken large doses of psychadelics knows the feeling when you suddenly realize that it's starting to kick in).\n\nWithin minutes I'm laying down on my sofa and I am completely losing touch with reality. I've taken a lot of psychadelics in my life, but this was  something else. I wasn't able to think straight. I would  completely  zone out for a few seconds and then come back and wonder if this was real life or a dream and keep praying for it to stop, asking myself WTF was happening to me over and over again. There were no hallucinations or visuals at all (just some audio distortions), but I was extremely confused and out of it. It was much closer to a delirium/psychosis than a psychadelic trip. I would compare it to my MXE experience, but while MXE was fun, this was extremely unpleasant and dark.\n\nOn top of that mental terror, I was also experiencing the worst withdrawal symptoms I have felt in my entire life. My whole body hurt immensely and it was violently and involuntarily jerking and twisting into weird and sometimes painful positions non-stop. There was a strange sensation in my mouth and throat as if I was about to throw up, but I never did, I just kept burping all the time. Of course, all the other typical WD symptoms like sweating, uncontrollable yawning, chills were present too. But the psychological aspect was by far the worst. It was like a bad dissociative trip and I seriously thought that I was about to die at one point.\n\nI couldn't understand what was happening and WHY it was happening - all I took was some oral oxy and naloxone! I even contemplated calling the ambulance at one point, but I could barely operate my phone. It took all my tripping  experience and willpower to remain as calm as possible given the  situation, remain grounded and to not do something stupid, but I was scared shitless. I was GONE. If anyone walked into my apartment  and saw  me they would have called an ambulance immediately (or an exorcist). I could also barely walk, my coordination was completely messed up.\n\nWhile this was happening I ingested 80mg of oxycodone hoping to put a stop to the nightmare but that barely did anything. I also ate a bunch of benzos  to try to stop the horrible jerking and body twisting and to calm myself down. These also only helped very little. For two hours I was in absolute agony, delirious, twisting and jerking on the couch, before the effects finally started to subside and I was able to lay down in bed. I don't know when I finally fell asleep, but it's been about 6 hours since the whole experience started and I feel mostly back to normal.\n\nThis wasn't anything like any opiate withdrawal that I have ever experienced. I have tried taking Targin before (even crushed) and at worst it made me feel shitty for an hour, but it wasn't unbearable. But this was literally 100x worse than any opiod withdrawal I have ever experienced. It was a trip. An awful, scary, painful trip that I wouldn't wish on even the worst criminals. It was pure mental and physical torture. It was my worst drug related experience ever by a long shot and I'm an experienced psychonaut who went through some challenging trips. I'm really struggling to even put into words how horrifying, painful and scary it was.\n\nOn r/drugs I originally posted 3 theories as to what happened to me:\n\n1. Burning the pill in the oven lead to some weird chemical change, creating a different chemical compound (very unlikely).\n2. That it was all a result of precipitated withdrawal.\n3. That my digital scale that I bough a few months ago from some guy online (it looked brand new and was in original packaging) was either malicously or mistakenly contaminated with a highly potent dissociative/deliriant drug which I ingested when I pressed my thumb against the scale a few times and put it in my mouth.\n\nAfter doing research, I found case studies of two heroin users going into precipitated withdrawal involving delirium after switching to suboxone. I also read that: \"A high incidence of delirium (20% over a period of 1 year) following rapid opioid detoxification with naltrexone and clonidine has been reported in methadone-dependent patients.\"\n\nSo now I'm starting to think that it was just an incredibly bad case of precipitated WD involving delirium caused by the naloxone, which I didn't actually manage to remove. The only question that remains is why I'm so incredibly sensitive to oral naloxone. There must be something about my physiology which dramatically increases naloxone uptake into the bloodstream from an oral dose.\n\nEither way, I feel lucky to be alive and I'm really shaken by the experience. Please be EXTREMELY careful when taking any opiod antagonist (naloxone, naltrexone, buprenorphine). If you have a big habit these drugs can cause unimaginable amount of pain and suffering as I learned yesterday.\n\n\\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_\n\nUPDATE 02/02/2021: I just came back to this post and throwaway account and it looks like people are still stumbling across my story every once in a while. I just wanted to let everyone know what really happened that evening, because I only figured it out a few days after I wrote this post. The burnt Targin pill that I talk about in the story had nothing to do with it. In the story I failed to mention that around 20 minutes after I ate the burnt Targin pill, I felt that nothing was happening and that I was in fact feeling a bit worse so I decided to snort a bit of oxy from my stash of regular oxycodone pills (without naloxone in them).\n\nThat's where the fuck up actually happened. I had a leftover 1/4 piece of a Targin 40mg pill which ended up among my stash of regular oxycodone pills by mistake. You probably see where this is going... Yes, I snorted that piece containing 10mg of oxy and 5mg of naloxone thinking it was a piece of a normal oxy pill. Now while naloxone is barely active orally, it gets absorbed pretty damn well and pretty damn fast if snorted. So I basically narcan'ed myself by accident while already feeling shitty as a result of being on much lower amounts of oxy than I was used to taking. The hell that I describe in the story started a minute or two after I snorted that piece, so that's what actually set it off, not the piece of burnt Targin pill that I ate (although a small amount of naloxone was probably absorbed orally even from that piece to add to the misery).",

I agreed there was no way I could ever be with another addict. \n\nI met my boyfriend at the methadone clinic. We both had group together. He told me he kept his head down most of the time but when he heard me talk, he had to look up. What I was saying was real, relatable & familiar. \n\nI fell in love with him the first day we started talking. Honestly. The things him and I share are things I've never ever shared with anyone else. The feeling of being so desperate, and so low, and so worthless. The feeling all of us addicts are too family with, I don't even have to explain to him. He just knows. \n\nI've come to realize all of this...everything, the addiction, the hitting rock bottom. All of it was to lead me to this life now. I'm the happiest I've ever been. Period. My mental health is progressing. We have a beautiful daughter together & he's a wonderful stepfather to my 3 kids. \n\nBut you're probably wondering if we've managed to stay sober. He is a substance abuse counselor and has been sober for the last 4 years. I had 2 years under my belt when I got sent to jail (first time ever) on a motion to revoke probation for a class c misdemeanor. I was devastated. Obviously i was sick coming off methadone and my mental health completely deteriorated the week I was there. When I got out, it was even worse. I got back on methadone immediately but the feeling of depression and anxiousness didn't go away. I did unfortunately have a slip. But he didn't. He stayed clean. He stayed by my side. He got me back on the right track and here we are....as happy as can be. \n\n2.5 years in to my relationship with my boyfriend who's also a recovering opiate addict and I've come to realize how can an addict NOT be with anyone but another addict? Being an addict is so much of who we are, so much of what we work on...there's no way I could be with anyone who didn't fully understand that. And yes while it is twice the risk, it's also twice the support. \n\nSo there definitely is hope for anyone who's ever wondered. \n",

You can read my posts for more details of my story.\n\nI won't make this too long but if you've read my posts you will read how much my life has turned around. I couldn't be happier. I moved out of a state to another and made the most positive friends in this world. I dont tell people my story in real life  because I'm scared they won't want to be friends anymore. But I now have a new car, new job, I get paid almost $20 more then a year ago, and i have nothing but positive people in my life.\n\nI didn't think I would make a year but I did it. I wish I could tell my friends and parents but for now I'm proud of myself. ",

    "selftext": "Unbelievable. The way I feel right now compared to the way I felt on Jan 19 is indescribably different. If I try my best to recall what I was going through, I can say that every day began with waking up and hating myself. Going through the motions, fighting like mad inside with the burning question: To pick up, or not to pick up. My health was terrible, my mood swings were volatile. My finances were in ruins, and to just think for a few minutes about how in the hell was I going to turn all of this around, well, I couldn‚Äôt bear the weight of it.... I‚Äôm never going back to any of that. Ever. \n\nThe feeling I have now is really one of deliverance and redemption. There is *possibility* in my life now, and that feeling wells up inside like a tide and fills me with such an enduring sense of happiness and gratitude, I thank God for the miracle and gift that is my life. I‚Äôm now back to building my life up again. Practicing music everyday, eating well and exercising, getting plenty of regular sleep and so on.... in short, the only kick I would get from scoring and doing opes would be nothing less than a severe kick in the balls. And then the head. And torso, over and over and over until I‚Äôm nothing left but a throbbing, bleeding mass of pulpy regret and defeat. \n\nFor those of you struggling, please hang in there? It‚Äôs hard at first. Hard... only begins to describe it! But just endure a little while and your agony will pass like everything else time eventually conquers. There is a life after opiates, and all of its solar joys and beauties stand as a polar opposite to the ugliness and nihilism of opiates. Don‚Äôt give up! Don‚Äôt go back! If you remember back to your bible classes (if you had those), Lot and his family were told to flee Sodom and Gomorrah, and were commanded not to turn their gaze back towards the devastation... imagine yourself in this scenario, only opiates are the taboo object you must not look back upon, lest you be turned into a pillar of salt. ...anyway, something like that. Our lives have far brighter futures, for all of us, as long as we press forward enthusiastically, with emboldened spirit, towards that better life. \n\nWith love,\n",

I couldnt care about shit else. \n\nI used to walk around the grocery store and sit every chance I got because I was sick. I'd see people shopping for groceries and their problems consisted of, at that moment, what was for dinner? coke or pepsi? american or cheddar? I envied them. They were able to shop for groceries, like a normal person. Today, I see those same people at the store and since I'm looking at them through different eyes they seem miserable. The same people I envied 4 years ago seem miserable today. They don't understand what they have. They take life free from alcohol and drugs for granted. Today I dont. Today I'm glad I'm a junkie.

    "selftext": "Hi yall, first time poster here. \n\nFrom 17-25 I was an opiate addict starting with hydros and eventually moved to iv heroin. After having a couple near death experiences and 6 rehabs I eventually decided it was my rock bottom and got clean. I was clean for nearly 7 years. \n\nFast forward to this year I had to have a major surgery to repair something. It‚Äôs a very painful recovery and the protocol for the Dr was prescribing everyone oxy for a month. I fought with myself tooth and nail if I should take it or not but ended up taking it. It opened the door back up. \n\n2 months later I decided with my condition I could manipulate my dr into giving me hydrocodone. I started abusing them immediately and when the script wasn‚Äôt enough I started buying blue fentanyl‚Äôs off the st. I got back into junkie habits and was hiding this from my year and a half relationship who I was about to propose to. \n\nShe caught me in about 2-3 lies and broke up with me last week. I‚Äôm heartbroken, and I knew this was gonna happen eventually if I didn‚Äôt stop but of course I did it anyways because that‚Äôs what junkies do. I‚Äôm not sure if we‚Äôre gonna get back together, but regardless I decided I need to get clean again. She said only time will tell if she can trust me again. She‚Äôs a normie so she doesn‚Äôt understand our behavior when we‚Äôre using. \n\nSo here I am in withdrawal and with a broken heart. I‚Äôve been praying I could win her back. This is the only girl I‚Äôve ever fell in love with. \n\nLife sucks right now man‚Ä¶",

    "selftext": "This is so hard for me to admit but I want help. How do I beat my addiction without letting my friends and family know I'm an addict?? I realize I am the true definition of a functioning addict and no one knows about it! I am a 46 year old grandmother of 3, I am the head of the household that includes my 2 adult kids and grandkids. I have been on oxy for almost 10 years and taking them daily for the past 5 years. Daily I MUST have about 60 in me. That means at least 2 -30s or 4 -15s or 6-10s just to feel normal. That cost about 100$ per day.  I have been able to hide this for multiple reasons. Taking pills is very easy and u can do it with no one seeing u. Ive had the same job for 15+ years in finance with the same company. I am still very good at my job. I have been able to hide my problem physically because the meds don't make me high due to my tolerance being super  high. I also look a lot younger than my age and am a plus size woman. I can take 3-30s at one time and still work without nodding off or showing any signs of being on oxy. It's really scary when I think about the fact that I have to take 4-30s to actually feel high. that's 160 total!!  I been lucky enough to juggle bills and rent making the payments happen in just enough time to prevent shut offs or eviction. I've had a lot of struggles due to the cost of my addiction. Ea few examples...Im constantly borrowing to make it to pay day... I lost my car because I couldn't fix it leading me to borrow my son's car for almost a year but now I'm on the bus because I havent been able to save for a car....I don't have some of the simple person things I need and I feel like I'm falling off more and more. I don't even get high from the meds. I have a legitimate pain related illness fibromyalgia which is how all this started. I want to stop 100% but the sickness I feel within 24 hours is so much that I'm really scared. I've tried to stop. I can't so I know I'm a addict. Please help! ",
