0,"i just survived a suicide attempt. and i just felt like i needed to say that to someone. (nsfw) i actually went through with it. i chugged half a bottle of scotch and swallowed down a bottle of hydrocodone acetaminophen. it had been expired for 6 months- and though i kept it in a cool dry place since getting my wisdom teeth taken out, it must have gone bad because i'm still here. waking up from that was so disappointing. i'm still here- alive- and i seriously don't want to be. but that's life ha. 

anyway i can't tell anyone about it. felt sick for hours and hours afterwards and just dealt with it alone. tried to call a friend but they ghosted. now what. people always tell me ""oh you've been through so much you're so strong you're so resilient"" i'm not trying to be resilient anymore i'm tired. i guess i'm either stupid enough to take bad pills or resilient enough to not die haha. i'll just have to figure out what i'm supposed to do with my life now. 

i just think it's wild that it didn't work and that i'm fine.",1,1

3,"i tried to end my life and woke up—twice. i don't know how and here's what happened. on january 20th, 2025, after a rough day and months of feeling like i'd lost everything, i decided i'd had enough. i got into my car with what i thought was the ""perfect recipe"" to go peacefully. i drove to a quiet, meaningful spot in the city—an empty, dimly lit street—around 12:30 am. i parked, sat there for a while, and even wrote a note apologizing to whoever might find me later.

around 1:30 am, i decided it was time. i took 10 mg of rivotril (clonazepam) to numb my body, hoping for a quiet passing. after that, i smoked two pre-rolled joints, thinking they'd make me drowsy. by 2:00 am, i felt the weed kicking in, so i started drinking shots from a 70cl bottle of jack daniels, believing the mix of alcohol and clonazepam would do the job. about 4–5 shots in, i felt weightless, my hands and feet went cold, and i thought, *this is it.* i said my goodbyes in my head and closed my eyes.

but instead of never waking up, i opened my eyes at 10:00 am to the sound of cars driving by. i saw a random guy carrying groceries and realized he hadn't noticed me. i still couldn't feel much or move properly, but i had another 10 mg of clonazepam with me, so i took it with some gatorade i found in the backseat, thinking this time i wouldn't wake up.

somehow, i woke up again at 4:00 pm to the sound of the same guy starting his car. i sat up, confused, still feeling like i was dreaming. i even reversed my car down the street for no reason, just acting on autopilot. i stared at the empty pill jar next to me and felt completely numb. in that haze, i made the poor decision to reach out to an ex, hoping she'd understand. she didn't—she just told me not to contact her. that hit hard, but i didn't have the energy to process it.

after sitting in my car in silence for 30 minutes, i slowly drove home. i don't even remember what someone said to me when i walked in. i just crawled into bed and slept for 16 hours. when i woke up, i whispered, *fuck,* partly amazed i was alive and partly frustrated. life quickly pulled me back in—work, friends, and random distractions like video games, late-night drives, and walks.

looking back now, i'm glad i woke up. that moment was a low spell, not my end. i still feel empty inside, but i've promised myself i'll never try to end things again. i'm seeking professional help, leaning on loved ones, and taking life one day at a time.

i just wanted to share this unfiltered story with the void. writing it all out feels oddly comforting, and i hope anyone reading this knows they're not alone. better days will come. i'm working on believing that, too.



tldr: i tried to end my life by mixing clonazepam, alcohol, and weed in my car late at night, thinking it would lead to a peaceful passing. despite taking multiple doses and feeling completely numb, i woke up twice—first at 10 am, then again at 4 pm. after failing to find comfort by reaching out to an ex, i drove home and slept for 16 hours. now, i'm reflecting on how i survived, seeking professional help, and holding onto hope that things will get better. writing this is part of my journey to heal.",1,1

me and my girlfriend were both female and our family in bith sides doesn't know this and her family is strict because of her religion and now i just spilled it out to her sister about us. i told her not to tell it to her, but when she went home, she decided to ask her what's her sexuality.

i know it's my fault, i made her out without her knowing and it's not my intention at all, all i want is an advice because i don't know where to go.

i got angry at her sister and she got angry at me too. my girlfriend got angry at me. i know she already agreed to meet me next month, but now she doesn't want to see me anymore. she said she almost gave me a chance but now she doesn't want to and told me to let go and move on.

to the people reading, i am so, so sorry you are trapped in atrocious circumstances or suffering such as war, unjust treatment, domestic violence, inescapable poverty, loneliness, crimes against humanity, the terror of being your biological gender but not having the resources and support to transition, and so many other injustices you do not deserve. this world is unabashedly brutal and horrible and i'm disheartened and disgusted that this the world we live in. i see you're trying to defend your fire against forces greater than yourself, and i am proud of you for living another day. some days are more overpowering than others, but i want you to understand that is no reflection of inherent unworthiness or lack on your part. you are doing what you can with the tools (if any exist) you understand how to use, so please do not beat yourself up more than you are already breaking. thank you for the chance you read this and we met. i wish to you all for external and internal resources come your way, freedom from suffering, empowerment, autonomy, courage, healing, resilience, personal fulfillment, growth, mercy and comfort for yourself, total fulfillment of your basic and inherent needs, and an abundance moments of expansive and loving joy. ♡

i even wish this for the people that have hurt me or willingly harmed others, because if we all possessed these things—especially the latter (as suffering is inevitable to some degree)—there would be no need or desire to cause harm. they could connect with others and themselves in the most positive and fulfilling of ways. at least.. that's how i feel.

i wish i could have made a great and bright impact on the world. the reason i am probably so hesitant is that my life has barely begun. i'm twenty years old. if i gave myself twenty to thirty years, i could probably gauge my impact, figure out what is wrong and strive for something better for everyone. i wish everyone felt that way to some degree. though, some people are afraid of opening pandora's box and don't realize they're actually in it.

if you read all this, thank you for reading. i hope i could make your day a little bit better. thank you.

  
**update (10/04/24)** :

i missed my ticket.  a few days ago, i tried to die and woke up the next morning with the most excruciating migraine and bodily weakness of my life. i still feel a bit weak. i see where i messed up a step and why i lived.  as of now, i'm on the margins of figuring out what to do next. even though mind is in a weird place, i do know that i'd like to thank and hug everyone who felt moved by my note. 

it is fact there is endless and boundless suffering in life. i am so sorry you cannot escape your undeserved agony, and i have my deepest compassion for your trying. you do not deserve this in the first place. for those whose suffering is more than they are capable of enduring, and whose challenges are practically insurmountable, i send you the highest and brightest peace, self-love and courage and my respect for your autonomy to make the best possible choice for yourself. to those who choose to pursue living, i eagerly support you to continue! i know it is hard. this cycle of inner struggle—spiraling, self-doubt, bitterness, frustration, delusion—is baked into our humanity, and we may never fully step out of that cycle until our last breath. but you know what? while we are alive, i rejoice in the days, moments, minutes, and seconds to spare you aren't caught in that cycle and feel connected with and free.

i purposely didn't elaborate what pushed me to suicide in my note, because this note isn't about me; it is about you. whether you sobbed, felt your stomach drop in fear, or clenched your fists in self-frustration, i dream you confront what your subconscious yearns for and achieve it. 

if i may include, this world *is* unbelievably fucking awful and cruel and full of suffering. i cannot dress up that undeniable truth in pretty words and still keep my integrity.

 knowing this—nearly dying—i realize there are things i wanted to do. i wanted to make the world a better place. i wanted to make people smile, to make people laugh. i wanted to lower people's guards and help them feel joy again. i wanted to ease people's stress and invite laughter. i wanted to help people open their pandora's box and show them there is still merit in staying in this world despite the horrors. i wanted every interaction i have to be raw, energetic, vulnerable, and alive, so that no one ever felt warranted to question my intentions; instead, they remember the humanity flowing in their veins. i wanted to wake up every morning and feel self-confident from sunrise to sunset, knowing that this is the gift i would deliver to you personally, and i would do it again and again and again. 

...now, despite that..

 ..i am just as much as hesitant to live as i was to die. even though i feel in tune with my life's purpose, the lack of noise in death fulfills a large part of me that life cannot. if i had given myself another twenty-five to thirty years, i could have departed on my deathbed with my head held high and spine erect. but that isn't now. frankly, a part of me wishes it were. i type this in hopes that maybe it will resonate with someone out there, and know that you aren't alone in feeling this way. 

thank you for reading this. have a good day, everyone. ♡",1,1
31,"nothing can save me, not even myself. some of you, may be suicidal, some of you have that shimmer, the light inside of you, flickering off and on. that light is your hope, your salvation, meaning, purpose.

some of you however are like me, the light that once flickered is now completely shut off. completely detaching you from this world, making you a worthless entity.

i am a nihilist, that is my view on the world, i believe things matter inside of this world but it has no value, it only matters to those who perceive it but ultimately we are equivalent to 0. because of my nihilistic views i struggle to be understood, instead people try so hard to convince me of their false optimism, i can't connect with others because i view their optimism as being disingenuous and i do not relate to those who aren't authentic.

i have no reason to be alive, everything feels dull, i have a low libido, i can't connect with anyone, i don't have anything i want to do, instead i want to watch the world descend into chaos. i want us all to crumble and break in the pressure of the world. i want us all to just perish. of course i don't want anyone to experience pain but i want us to all have our revelation, our revelation will be the realization that the chaos we live in is all for nothing.

i am so tired of talking, trying to escape my fate, trying to be ""helped"", i've accepted the reality and i will never live under the false pretense that my life should continue. i am so tired of talking, i wish i could just blow my brains out already.

this is gonna sound incredibly stupid,but i don't want there to be confusion in case my suicide somehow makes news and becomes another stupid study on mental health or whatever. i mean,even if it does,it won't matter since most strangers mourn for a few days before forgetting about it and moving on to the next tragedy or whatever. sorry if this is one of the stupider posts to grace your feeds.",1,1

38,"alone in my pain the weight of my thoughts is suffocating me. each day feels heavier than the last, and i can't shake this feeling of despair. i've been struggling with loneliness for so long, and it's like a never-ending cycle of emptiness. the people around me don't seem to see the depth of my agony, and i feel invisible in my own suffering.  i've faced heartbreak after heartbreak, losing loved ones to the cruel hands of fate. the pain of losing my mom to cancer still lingers, and now, with the news of my dad's cancer spreading, i feel like the ground is crumbling beneath me. the thought of being an orphan is unbearable, with no one left to share my memories or dreams. it's like a dagger in my heart, twisting with each passing moment.  i'm teetering on the edge of giving up, of succumbing to the darkness that whispers of an end to this agony. the idea of ending it all feels like the only escape from this overwhelming sorrow. i have no one to turn to, no one who truly understands the depth of my despair. the pain is searing, and i feel like i'm drowning in an ocean of grief.  i don't know how much longer i can hold on. the thought of meeting my mother again in a place beyond this suffering is a flicker of solace in this endless night. maybe in death, i'll find the peace",1,1

42,"whst a life this is. so, i'm 17 now. everything feels so different and the same, i still feel like i did when i was 12 during peak covid, i'm laying in bed every day doing nothing but it had real consequences now, i'm close to being kicked out of college because my attendance is so low and honestly i don't care. i'm clearly not okay and it feels like nobody is noticing, my sister recently got diagnosed with cancer and i want to be there for there because she's going through so much, she has two kids and i want to offer to babysit but i'm so unreliable, i skip out of plans like they don't matter because i can't bring myself to get up. last year i got so close to ending it, i told my mother, she kept pressing and pressing when i sent her a long text telling her exactly what i needed from her in that moment but she basically ignored it. then in november i actually tried and it was pathetic, i thought i could jump into a river and it would do most of the work but it didn't, it was waist deep, i just stood there and then had to wade through the water to get out, it left me aching and so, so cold. i got home and had to lay under my blankets for hours so i didn't become hypothermic and it was pathetic. my room smelled like mildew until i could bring myself to put the clothes covered in the much from the river into the washing machine. i'm starting to turn to substances and my mother is helping me indulge in it and i know it's wrong but i can't bring myself to care, she says i can smoke or have weed because she's scared of losing me, she doesn't know how to help and it's damaging but at this point i feel like i need to get high to make it go away for a bit. she took me to the gp the morning after the night i told her i was going to end it and the guy was nice but not even he could do anything, the youth service said two years ago i've done everything they could recommend and they accepted that self harm was just something i did. the man i saw in the gp said i most likely couldn't get onto antidepressants until i was 18 because they can make teenagers more suicidal but i honestly don't think i can be more suicidal at this point. i need help and i've exhausted all the resources. every day it gets harder and i'm just doing nothing, i can't go to college without pain, any amount of light gives me migraines, people on campus won't stop meowing at me or asking about why i don't use my cane on campus and it's exhausting, i have to wake up at 6 am to go at 8 am to college and i get home at 5 which doesn't seem like a lot, especially for people with full time jobs but i can't handle it, i come home in pain and exhausted, i can't even use willpower to get myself to college every day, when i was going in the first term, i had 100% attendance for the first two weeks and even then i was planning what days i would have time to shower, wednesday's are half days so usually i'd shower on wednesdays and monday mornings and that's it, i feel gross and disgusting for it but at this point, i've attended college twice this year and i haven't showered since then, i'm disgusting and i hate it but i can't even bring myself to take care of my hygiene or anything, i've had two of my molars surgically removed already and i'm still not brushing my teeth, i haven't gone outside, i don't know if i nescaserally want to die but i do know i don't want to live like this. my ex who i never properly broke up with started dating someone else and unadded me on everything when we were actually on good terms. i have a few friends in college but i don't know if i can even keep going for them, they're all so nice and they deserve to be happy and i can't stop thinking about how much it would hurt them if i was gone, one girl i talk to most is so nice, whenever i'm in college she talks about how she missed me and it makes me happy that someone cares but i also want to distance myself from everyone so it doesn't hit so hard if i do end up gone forever. last year i got the confirmation that my hospital can't do anything else for my eyes and they've steadily been getting worse, my nystagmus has too and it's exhausting, i can't sleep and when i do it's always too much, i stay up for days and sleep for twenty hours, i want to tell someone, to get some kind of help but i've lost hope, i've already been failed multiple times already. i don't want to fail myself by giving in and letting go of everything i've been working so hard for. i never got my gcse's because my attendance in secondary school ended up being 0.05* in the end. my college attendance is 43% and there's always a meeting lined up about it, they're going to kick me out and i won't have a path to follow anyone and it's terrifying. i'm scared of growing up because i was never treated like i would, if i didn't make an effort to make myself look as unique as possible, the only thing people would look at me and see is my blindness. i want to be someone and i'm afraid of the very real possibility that i never will be. i lost my binder a little after christmas and even though i don't use it all of the time, it was oqe if the only things that made me feel more comfortable and gave me agency over how i looked. i'm so scared.

51,"i'm sick and heartbroken and depressed i'm sick. and i don't know what i'm sick with. i've been sick on and off for three years, but it's really bad right now. i can't do anything and everything is falling apart. 

i was making something of myself. spring of 2022, i started dating the love of my life. he was my best friend. i was living with my parents and he moved in with us for the summer. i was the happiest i can ever remember being. last january, he told me he needed space. it came out of nowhere and i felt so blindsided, but i agreed. i gave him space. but then he wanted less space. we were long distance and he lived a couple of hours away but before christmas we'd been seeing each other almost every weekend. after christmas i didn't see him until february. 

i was working on my masters. i was getting my life together, working hard. but my health started declining. i spent a month in january/february taking classes from home because i was too sick to make it to the school. i didn't know what was wrong. i still don't really know what's wrong. some things have gotten better and i've done some tests, but i'm so tired all the time. i spend most of the day sleeping and the rest of the day lying down. i get so dizzy and i keep fainting and my heart rate is constantly through the roof. 

my partner and i broke up in the summer of 2023. i thought i was going to die. i wanted to die. he'd told me i could rely on him, that we were going to get a house together someday, that we could get a pet. he told me  that he couldn't picture a future without me in it. he told me that he didn't know if he wanted kids, but if he did, it would be with me. but by the end, it was like he didn't care about me at all, even though he said that he did. he kept saying he would come see me, but he cancelled every time. even when we were breaking up, he said he would come so we could talk in person, but he never did. he told me i could talk to him about anything, but when i tried to tell him how hurt i felt, he blew me off. he never wanted to hear it. 

the final straw was when he said he was going to stay where he was the next fall and start a school program. he'd said we would discuss our plans together, but then sprung that on me. there was no discussion. there was no room for me in his life. i'd had this stupid dream that we'd be together that fall, that we'd make it work. but he didn't want that. he didn't want me. not badly enough to try to be with me. 

and i just keep getting sicker. it's been six months since we broke up and i'm supposed to be working on my final project for school, but i'm too sick. i've had to break my lease in my apartment and move back to my hometown, back in with my parents, because i don't want to take out more student loans if i'm not doing schoolwork and i'm too sick to work. i'm in my parents' basement, in a room that's mostly being used for storage, living out of suitcases for the last month. i'm trying to find a tenant for my apartment and i'm trying to take a leave of absence from school and i'm trying to make living here work. but i'm so tired. and everything is so difficult. 

and the worst part is that he's here. the program he'd been planning to do was in another town, but he decided to take a job here instead. he's living with my brother and his wife (they were all friends before he and i got together). he's just across town. but i can't reach out to him. i can't put myself out there when he's given no indication that he's willing to put in any effort for me. i can't open up to him only to be shut down again. 

he said he wanted to be friends but i barely hear from him. and i can't pretend that i'm not still hurting, that i have no anger, no pain. i can't just be friends and act like everything's okay. 

but i miss my best friend so much. i miss my boyfriend. i miss the love of my life. i miss having hope and excitement for the future. i miss having someone who loved me more than anyone, and who i loved. i miss feeling alive. i miss doing things and spending time with the people i care about. i miss having a purpose and drive and ambition. i miss going out with the dogs and hiking and going to hot yoga and dancing. 

and i hate it here. i hate this room. i hate that he took his stuff out of this room but he left his ex's stupid fucking wine rack that she didn't want. i hate that he's not here. i hate that every inch of this house reminds me of him. i hate that i've lost everything i've worked for, and i don't know if or when i'll have the energy to fight to get it all back. i hate that he's going to move on and meet someone else, and i'm going to be stuck in this basement, too sick to be wanted. i hate that i'm barely a person anymore because of this illness. i hate that he gets to have a life and move on and be happy. i hate that i'm in pain all the time. i hate that i'm getting fat because i can't do anything. i hate how pathetic i am. i hate pretending i'm okay when i'm not.

depression has been a part of my life since the age of seven, i can't imagine life without depression and suicide thoughts because that's all i ever think about, no matter what. yes, of course i have times where i feel wonderful and where my life is going somewhat decent but life is completely fucking with me. even though i have amazing friends and a wonderful boyfriend that keep up with my shit. 

my best friend, ""m"", has never met a me without depression. when i moved away from the place i grew up (which really effected my mental health because i had to leave the people i grew up with) she was the first person i talked with. the first friend i made, the first day of second grade, she was there. she smiled at me and we walked home together. ever since that moment i knew she was a keeper. and she is, she's seen me in the worst possible states but also in some great ones, and i appreciate her and her presence. she is a great person, just like her boyfriend. ""l"" is my male best friend, and i brought him together with ""m"". they are like siblings. siblings that listen to you and want you to feel alright. 

but now, to the people that made me depressed. my family. my father is pure hell but i love him, even though he is a shit father. i try to keep up with him and to spend time with him because he has cancer and diabetes. but i haven't talked to him in a while, even though we literally live in the same house. everytime we talk it's just yelling because ""i'm the reason why he's dying"" and ""everything is my fault"" and because ""i'm ruining this family"" everytime he says shit like that, i believe him. i am a shit kid because he is a shit dad, but i can't control myself. i'm the black sheep. the one with the dyscalculia, i'm the one with depression, i'm the one with bpd. i'm just the mentally ill one out of the other 3 perfect kids my father has. i am the outcast, i've always been. 

my mama.. i don't know what to say about her. she met my dad at a very young age (she was 15 and he was 32) and they've been together ever since. she is.. complicated. i can talk with her but i can't. she's very irrated after work and she works almost everyday so i get yelled at and shit at when the house isn't clean or something. but mama listens to my cries because she sees that i'm struggling mentally, but she's never sent me to a therapist because she tried to ""fix"" me herself. (she's a psychologist.) she is a total sweetheart and an amazing mother, but when she's pissed, she drops very hurtful things. she always says i'm like my dad. last time she said that i broke down crying, saying ""i don't want to be like him"" and she just said ""then don't be."" which didn't make it any better.. :/ but, me and her had many deep and sad talks. i once asked her ""why didn't you leave?"" and she was like ""because he wasn't like this back then and now i can't leave because.. what kind of shit move is it to leave the guy that cared for you so many years, right as his health starts to get worse?"" i just looked down and nodded, saying that i get what she is saying, because i do get it. 

to my siblings.. they are complicated. they treat me like dirt but they love me. one of my little sisters, ""i"", always tells everyone irl that she loves me and that i'm her favorite sister but at home she puts me down. probably because she sees that dad gives her praise, but oh well, what do i know? and yeah, the youngest, ""c"", just purely and truly hates me but also loves me sometimes. everytime she does some shit, she puts the fault on me and they believe her which pmo so bad sometimes. but do i put up a fight? hell no. and well, my older brother, ""a"" is.. scary. when we were little we were best friends and hung out together. but now he hates me. i don't even think he remembers the shit he's done to me. i remember so vividly the one time he tried to f*ck me. yes, f*ck me. he was like.. 13? and i was 10. he wanted to stick it in till he heard our parents car pull into the driveway. i thank god that nothing happened that day. i don't hate my brother, i just find him weird. he hates me but he doesn't? i don't know. i feel uncomfortable around him most of the time. but.. yeah.

and now to.. my baby, my everything, ""k"". kevin has been my boyfriend for two months now and he's heard about the shit i'm going through. he wants me to go to the police the whole time because my dad sometimes still tends to be abusive but my heart can't handle sending a cancer sick diabetic old man in jail for treating me like shit for years. he's a huge prick but he's my father and somewhere i still love him even though i want him dead sometimes. but, ""k"" has been there for me in every single situation, trying to make me feel better and to cheer me up, he's the best boyfriend a girl could ask for, like.. seriously.

this is a long ass fucking vent and i'm so sorry to anyone who's reading this but i just can't anymore. 

i want to stay alive but these thoughts and voices are getting louder everyday. i have a lot of reasons to live, ""m"", ""l"", my mom, my boyfriend, ""k"". but i feel like they are getting tired of me. it's the same shit everyday. i'm happy, i lose energy and ignore them because i'm crying or slitting my fucking wrist like a fucking selfish bastard. i promised mama so many times that i'm going to stop but i can't. i seriously cut to feel something else than this crippling sadness. the sudden bursts of energy and happiness make me insane, i don't want to he happy for few minutes/hours, i want to be happy for a few days, weeks, maybe even months! but i guess that's too much to ask. 

i'm sorry for venting. i'm sorry if this is tmi. but i don't want to keep on living, not even for my favorite people, i'm just fucking tired. sorry.

i've taken care of enough failed suicide patients at the hospital. sometimes these failed suicide attempts result in them being disabled for the rest of their lives, so i guess you could say that i've learned from them. i know what i have to do to be successful which is a bullet to the head. i have been making plans on buying a gun and finally having my peace. i don't have the gun yet but i've researched on how to obtain one in my state which seems pretty straightforward. 

i'm going to utilize the next couple weeks to get my belongings, assets, accounts, and money in order to make sure that everything is easy as possible for my parents to manage. i already have made an entire ""to do"" list before i finally go, figuring out who to address in my note, ensuring beneficiaries are in place, usernames/passwords to my accounts, those types of things.

my heart is heavy. i really thought i would accomplish great things in this world. as a little girl i always thought i'd do great things and daydreamed a lot about a happy, successful life. instead i'm a lonely, failure, friendless loser. the one ""kinda"" friend i have… yeah i tried opening up as a last ditch effort and i got left on read. i tried calling my friend and he ignored me and never called back. just little shit like that that adds up. if i had a friend that needed me… man i'd drop everything for them if i knew how bad they were struggling. i'd do anything for my loved ones. it's just not the same for me. i am perpetually lonely. i try to make friends and it seems to backfire on me more often than not. that's the least of my worries though. all in all, trying to do anything in this life is just painful. even the things that used to bring me happiness… yeah. not anymore. i used to be a drummer and toured around the country a few times. really good times. i've sold most of my gear at this point and still working on selling the final last few things so my parents don't have to deal with that.

the only thing that sometimes gave me a purpose was being a nurse and caring for others - but i'm completely burnt out and hate it - and it's part of the reason that i am going. getting a degree in healthcare was one of the worst possible decisions i could've made for myself. it has truly ruined me. but that's just a piece of the puzzle. anyway, i'm gonna stop blabbering.

 i plan to end my own life.

 i have no time or date set yet but i know it is inevitable. and i know my death with be a relief to every person i have ever loved or cared for as my existence has been whittled down to just receiving and giving pain. they will sigh and thank me for relieving them of the burden of having me in their life. the burden lifted off their shoulders.

i truly ask,  what is the point of living in this cruel and heartless world any more?

 all i do is suffer and cause pain to anyone that comes into my life. i can't work or provide for myself. i am an emotional wreck and a dried up and useless husk of a person. i have lost the will to try, and i'm so tired of begging for help with no relief.

i'm 34 years old with no family, friends, education, job, house or car.  i don't have and can't afford to have kids.  i have no ambition, and no way to improve myself or my life. i'm stuck. my existence now is only meant to serve others. i get taken advantage of, used, manipulated and lied to. and the men in my life only want to use my body for their sexual gratification. i have no soul and they don't care about my well-being or happiness. just what i can offer them.

i have nothing to fight for and i'm tired of wanting to be happy, aching to belong and to be understood and loved only to be abused and abandoned. 

what really solidified this choice is the people i love and care about most, they have shown me how little importance my life really has because they walked away no longer caring if i live or die. showing me such coldness and neglect.  for god sake, my own abusive, belittling and demeaning family has even turned their back on me.

it's just too much.  too painful. i cannot handle another 60 years of this half life, scared to leave my home, scared to talk to anyone because i'd just recieve pain and rejection. i'm scolded for feeling emotions, i'm scolded for loving others and wanting to be loved. i can't do or say anything right. i'm always doing something 'abusive' or 'unhealthy' with no one in my corner supporting me or encouraging me.

i truly believe i have been cursed to walk this earth alone. and i'm not willing to do that.

it's been 34 years of misery, child abuse, neglect,  rejection, pain and embarrasment. and no amount of hospital visits, therapy sessions or medications can ever 'fix' or 'fill' this enormous void i feel inside myself. that in fact, i have always felt.  i've run out of patience, time or care.

i want peace. i want this unbareble pain to stop. i want the nightmares and ptsd memories to stop. and i want to be able to choose when and how i go out.

i've tried everything to love myself and to get better and be better but i just don't think that's possible for me any more unfortunately.",1,1

after 3 days of not speaking, i gave him a long speech how betrayed and disgusted i was, and how he should quit porn. he blamed it on being high. we started talking again, everything resumed like nothing happened.

some people also mentioned it probably wasn't weed but some other drug, and looking back they are probably right. i've seen him high many times before and after this incident, but that day he went to the bathroom and when he returned his behavior was very unusual.

reporting him to police realistically won't have any legal consequences for him. telling to my parents is way too scary for many reasons, and it seems too much to unload on a friend either. i will however try to gather enough courage to go to a therapist and start locking my bedroom door at night. thank you for your advice and kind words.",1,1

my partner has been emotionally unavailable for days and i don't know why. i've been having a panic attack sense i woke up and he just told me ""fucking stop"". so i'm crying in the bathroom until it's time for me to leave for work while he sleeps. i don't know what i did to deserve to be this miserable. i've been self harming sense i was 9 and i'm trying so hard not to relapse. 
eveyone else gets to be emotional. everyone else gets to have bad days. the second i do i'm a fucking problem. i don't get bad days. i don't get to be reckless. i don't get to get any sort of care i fucking need when i'm down. 
i tried killing myself last year and no one even fucking knows. no one would give that much of a shit. i wanna die. it feels like life rewards the worst fucking people with the best while i spend my days looking for an out. i'm waiting to snap one day and become the worst fucking person on earth. im scared that's gonna happen. the things i like about myself are gonna be gone. that's not worth it to me. i wanna die. i wanna actually do it. i'll leave my savings to my partner and hope he'll be okay. but i can't fucking be this person forever.

163,"i need to vent about my life . i honestly dont know how to keep going, i had these thoughts before as well, but now theyre back and i really feel like im ready now. 
i havent had the best life, started off as a mistake, mom and dad werent even never together. got a shitty narcissistic stepdad who basically took everything from me, my mom, my dad and even tried taking my life. luckily i left my toxic excuse of a family a few years back and moved with my grandparents. otherwise i would really have committed then and there. but what really hurts the most is how my mom decided to stay with that man, how she quietly watched how he treated me and saw me leave everything behind just so i could save myself, and still chose him over me. 
im not in contact with my dad too much either, but more than my mom. i really feel like an orphan, but its even worse when you have parents, but theyre just not there because they abandoned you. 
i havent got much friends either, or ones that really care. the only person by my side is my grandma and im so terrified of the day she passes, what will my life become then, then i can truly say that i have no one. i should be studying but i got no motivation, i just cant do anything, i dont care about anything, i have no dreams. the only thing that somehow has kept me going is my dog, but now even that doesnt make me want to go on. i didnt write my whole life down and left out the gruesome stuff and all. in my 18 years of life i cant really remember anything good happening, a whole life should be ahead of me but regarding the life i have had so far i got no hopes for a better one.  i really thought that once i got away from my stepdad id be happy, seems like that isnt the case, just when i thought i got better, depression decides to make a comeback.

165,"worried my life is over before it even had a chance to begin. my whole life story. not set up to succeed. kept imprisoned since birth. you may have heard most of this before. but now i am sharing it publicly on my main account. because i am desperate and no longer have any shame or fucks left to give. there is no life for me here and i have felt suicidal all my life and almost committed suicide last year because i can't find a way to escape. i can't let this be my life and this is pure torture and torment, so i was going to escape the only way that was available.

no one has my best interest in mind and they treat me like i don't matter. like my needs don't matter and like i don't deserve a good life. i was born in a really bad place (a third world country) where i don't belong, i don't share any values or worldviews with them, and nothing about this place is normal to me or reflects who i am at all. there is no life for me here. i didn't have a life, a childhood, or any relationships with anyone i love or respect. i hate this place and always have. i was abandoned as a newborn, but it's not like it matters, since the people who adopted me have not given me a good life, because, quite frankly, no one here can give me what i need. they think a good life is superfluous. but they were especially abusive, and even people here would probably agree. they are religious extremists, moralists, and pro-life. i am irreligious and pro-choice. i used to be an atheist/materialist (even as a kid i never believed in their religion, they could never condition me), now i am quite spiritual/idealist and woo woo. but still very much an individualist and independent thinker. i am not a realist or practical. i believe in the impossible. i am very sensitive, so being in this hostile environment that is not aligned with my soul's truth is really harmful and distressing.

i don't know how this was allowed to happen to me. the fact that they think they know what's best for me or that they are my people or that they are good for me when they have abused me my entire life and i feel so uneasy and disturbed by their presence is so unsettling. i have nowhere to turn to. this place is so crowded. i hear everything and just being in this environment is so disturbing. even in my room. i can't get any peace. and knowing that if i open the door and go outside it gets much worse. even if i was in a soundproof box. i would still feel disturbed by just being here. just because it's normal for them, it's not normal for me. nothing about this place is normal. and they treat me like i'm the problem and that i am crazy and i am not allowed to feel the way i feel and think like i think. that who i am inside doesn't matter. they think they own me and that i belong here, when i don't. they are not my family. just hearing their voices makes my skin crawl. they never were. but they keep getting away with this. this is not my life. i need to leave.

i just want to be able to live life unburdened by the expectation to be someone i am not. and free from this fake identity and role that were imposed on me and do not reflect me in the slightest.

they think i am the problem and it took me a while to heal from the damage of the years of being invalidated and gaslit, including by the dozens of therapists i was forced to see. no matter who i talk to here, and explain i've been psychologically abused by my parents, they always take their side and say i should be grateful and have nothing to complain about, and that i need help, but not in a nice way, they just think the way i think is wrong. that i should be grateful i don't technically live in a slum, and that i was adopted, that i am educated (when everything i know i had to teach myself), that i am not starving. and, like, i have nothing. i don't have a life, i have none of my needs met, but i am expected to give up who i am and live for other people i don't even like, people i absolutely hate, because the little that i have is apparently too much. that i should just accept this and stop complaining. they are unwilling and unable to understand me and the extent to which they have wronged me. they think they own me, and that i shouldn't have a choice as to who i am. i need to leave.

i don't understand why i am expected to have to deal with this and talk to these people and have to interact with people who disturb me to my core, and be surrounded by them, being forced to hear them playing their disgusting music. i literally have to have something playing 24/7 on my headphones, so i don't hear what's going on outside and the noises people make, because then i am reminded of them and who i am surrounded by. i also can't meditate or listen to something relaxing, because some of the outside noise will seep through and ruin the vibe and throw me off completely and make me panic. i have to wait until i literally pass out every time i sleep because i can't just lie down quiet, it's not my thoughts that are the problem, it's the environment and noises that don't let me relax, and i am pretty sure i wouldn't have to worry and would be easier for me to dismiss scary and intrusive thoughts if i knew i was safe, but i am still here. i am still in the dangerous situation. i watched a reading a few weeks ago that summed up a lot of what i am having to deal with pretty well, she said what she was picking up on was ""the dichotomy between how you feel within your own being and what you know to be your truth spiritually, versus what the world shows you and how the world treats you"". it's about the fake life i am forced to live and about how people project their stuff and expectations onto me here and that it's an ugly duckling type of scenario. they could never do right by me.

i have really tried up until a couple of years ago, i went to therapy, i sort help, even saw a few local spiritual practioners, but they only ended up doing more harm than good because of their perspective and how they see the world, i am glad it didn't work out because i was seeking help from the wrong people, people who could never understand me or my needs, i literally couldn't physically continue this charade or pretend to have this fake life, or having to continuously interact and deal with them and have that be my life. and i came to learn that was the correct thing to do, gave me some peace of mind and brought me back to my energy. me having to ""live"", work, study here, interact with them, i couldn't do that. it would destroy my soul, and just being here does. every time i am forced to talk and interact with them is torture. they don't care about me and my feelings or well being, i don't care about them either, this situation doesn't benefit anybody, they are energy vampires and survive off draining me, they know that once i am gone, they will stop being able to feed off my precious and rare energy, they just want to dim my light because they know what i have and am, they could never have that or be that.

someone left me somewhere, at a sort of social work department of a maternity hospital when i was approximately 2 weeks old, and what had happened to me up until that point is a mystery.

it's really messed up because in my adoption papers it says that someone was handed me to hold by presumably my mother nearby the hospital while they would make a phone call and they would come back and never did, but then apparently someone talked to the people who worked there a nurse at the time, and she said what she heard from the people who worked at that department that it was my mother herself, a teenager apparently who went to the social work department directly and left me there and didn't provide any identifiable information and they just let her leave.

and then i was put up for adoption. but anywhere i ended up here would have been just as bad. they came up with this whole story that the person who got handed me on the street, was handed me by an east asian lady, so confusing, it's what's on my adoption papers, but there aren't many people other than locals here, because who would want to immigrate here, and i did one of those genealogical dna tests in order to find who did this to me, and never got a close enough match, but i am not of asian descent, they just said that because to them i looked like it when i was a newborn, so they just came up with this whole story to cover up for her, and they didn't take a name or anything. probably gave birth to me in the hospital and was told to bring me back later, and forego the whole adoption process.

so cover ups, deceit, and lies from the off. a whole conspiracy against me. there is no one or no where i can turn to. i was told all the time as a kid, that i was a bad person, and should live in fear of some karmic retribution, consequences, and having to pay. that i was a liar, and a bad person, and that life was going to get me (when it already had. they were trying to make me fear hell, when i was already in it, lol), when the reality was they were just too strict. and also being told that you have to work hard and toil and suffer and that life is struggle and sacrifice. they just made me live in fear. that at any point i could lose anything. and things could get worse. and i would just have to learn to live with it. and they told me that life is sacrifice and struggle. and that suffering is somehow a virtue. they have no concept of quality of life, mental well being, or hobbies. anything. they don't know what that is. they don't care that i wasn't set up to succeed, no one here cares about that. they think life here is normal.

my parents made me get into local universities four times. and every time i had to take this stupid exam, because they don't have something like an sat exam or a-levels, and i had to take this exam every year and can't ever reuse the scores or anything. but i would attend the first few classes and then start skipping and going to the library to be on my laptop because i literally couldn't physically bring myself to attend them. like, they don't have many course options here, nothing interesting, and it's a very closed off country to the world, the way they teach things is wrong. everything they teach is so wrong, they are so closed off to the world at large and really ignorant about stuff. so, it's not like a course i could sit through. i couldn't have a job here or have most of my time be spent listening or talking to these people living this fake life.

there is no institutional support here and i have spent all my life in therapy and they have done me more harm than good, people here don't know what quality of life and wellbeing is. i have had to learn myself to undo the damage they have done to me.

i have literally been forced to interact with those people for decades now, i literally can't stand this anymore. i feel like i will go insane and start banging my head against the wall or something if i am forced to have a life here and have to interact with these people.

i can't even bear to be here. i will never feel good here. this is agony and torture. life is asking too much of me. to figure out a way out and to have some mental and emotional well being. well, i can't whilst living in this place. it's just not conducive to that. i don't know what i am supposed to do. i can't be okay with everything going on around me and just being here. i can't be focused or at peace or have a game plan. i can't function at all. i can't do anything about the situation and i can't bear to even be in this country. i might start banging my head against the walls. how can i do anything? be expected to focus on anything and just be fine when i am in this shithole. i will never be happy in this place. i am not okay. i need help. and it's not available. not mental health help. they have tried for years to ""fix"" me with therapy and meds. i am too good for this place. i will never be happy or feel good or even function here. no institutional help, i have no rights, nowhere to turn to. well, this place is the problem. can't go asking for help from the people that are the problem and have harmed me. not that i haven't tried. and i want nothing from them anyway. they literally can't understand me. i can't stand all the gaslighting and abuse. this place is the bane of my existence and my personal hell.where i am being forced to live is the reason for all my trauma, there is no quality of life here, it is a culture i don't belong in, i am being abused, there is no life for me here and i am constantly disturbed to my core by the surroundings and external stimuli, because this place is unsettling and disgusting. and i can't do anything to leave because of my debilitating anxiety, ocd, intrusive thoughts. i am in constant fight or flight mode and mid-trauma and have been for all my life.

i struggle with constant intrusive thoughts and ocd. i feel like i spend 24/7 battling them and fending my deepest fears off. they are mainly thoughts of me becoming someone i am not (someone from this place), or that i could start thinking and feeling like them or find this place appealing. those who are familiar with pure o and intrusive thoughts know they attack your core identity and values and try to convince you that you are or could become someone completely opposite to what you are.

i just feel this constant threat looming over and that i have to be hypervigilant, because sometimes the intrusive thoughts come so i have to keep reassuring myself all the time of my true opinions and feelings about things, and try to keep them at bay, and sort of worried about doing enough to correct the intrusive thoughts when they come. because i can't find myself in the things around me and this environment and there are a lot of projections and expectations on me to be someone that is the opposite of what i am, so it's like my mind and my sense of self is the only thing i have and that's so at odds with reality and circumstances, and this ""life"" right now and the people i have surrounding me. i have always felt like i had to protect my self and my whole identity and being was constantly under threat.

this has always felt like an ugly charade they have put together just to torture me, and it feels like i am stuck in this nightmare. life is asking too much of me. when all i have needed since i was a child was safety, security, and a home and i never had that. it's a miracle i have survived this far. i remember thinking when i was a kid that no one in the history of humanity had suffered as much as i had or felt like that, even if their circumstances had been worse on paper, because that was my personal hell and i feel things very deeply. and honestly, i am still kind of convinced no one has. 27 seven years. people get less time for murder.

if it's not clear from the text, i am being forced to ""live"" in a squalid third world shithole, and people here are extremely ignorant and backwards.

there is no one or no where i can turn to. i was told all the time as a kid, that i was a bad person, and should live in fear of some karmic retribution, consequences, and having to pay. that i was a liar, and a bad person, and that life was going to get me (when it already had. they were trying to make me fear hell, when i was already in it, lol), when the reality was they were just too strict. and also being told that you have to work hard and toil and suffer and that life is struggle and sacrifice. they just made me live in fear. that at any point i could lose anything. and things could get worse. and i would just have to learn to live with it. and they told me that life is sacrifice and struggle. and that suffering is somehow a virtue. they have no concept of quality of life, mental well being, or hobbies. anything. they don't know what that is. they don't care that i wasn't set up to succeed, no one here cares about that. they think life here is normal.abandoned and left behind to rot and be misunderstood, abused and psychologically tormented, and expected to live a fake life. i can't get out of this on my own. but people are unwilling to acknowledge that i am not the problem, i have been wronged. and i can't pull myself out of this situation on my own. i am in a disturbing environment that disturbs me to my core, surrounded by abusers. if my needs were acknowledged i wouldn't be in this mess.

i have spent all of my teenage years and up until a couple of years ago. going to the therapist every week. and gone through many psychiatrists and psychologists and prescribed all the depression and anxiety medications there are. honestly, everything they have told and how they treated me only did me more harm than good. nothing they have ever said has ever helped. completely ineffective treatments, it's almost like i wasn't the problem and it's the case that i am in a traumatic situation and don't have my needs met. i have been working on myself and undoing the damage that they have done. started listening to myself. only after i went off on my own, and started awakening spiritually that's when i started, well, finding myself, and that, you know, acknowledging my own needs and seeing how abused and wrong i was, because all they could do before was gaslight me and side with my parents. and i used to be really depressed and pessimistic, the most pessimistic person ever, now i have found hope within, you know, even when i used to think the only way out of this was to off myself, it was from a place of self-respect and self-love, and not resining myself to these circumstances i was optimistic and looking forward to getting a new life, hopeful for a new life. i was looking to the future with a sense of hope and possibility. so, yeah. i know enough about this place and how things work here, and also, you know, not wanting to deal with them because they disturb me, and i know they'll never understand me or my needs.

and i have been on anxiety medication. on benzos at some point. and medication for ocd, that it was me who had to find out that i had it. because they had misdiagnosed me so much in the past. but honestly, i never felt any difference. because that would be periods between treatments where i would come off them for a few months and or between treatments. never felt a difference, it never got worse or better. it's almost like that wasn't the problem. because how could i ever be satisfied with a fake life. and when you are not living your truth, it's meant to be uncomfortable, otherwise i wouldn't leave. i would just live empty and apathetic because i here i am living this lie in a role imposed on me by others that has nothin to do with who i actually am, and not surrounded by anything that has any meaning to me or reflects me, my purpose, or truth in anyway. because my soul knows i deserve more.

they have treated my needs for safety, home, quality of life, and to be around my people as fanciful pipe dreams all my life. they would just tell me to get a life here and make friends here and have a job here, and maybe one day i could leave, when i can't let this be my life, or become this fake person. this isn't even the real world. everything about this place is completely backwards. being forced to live like them and speak their language, and not have access to any of the experiences, stimuli, or environments i needed. it's not like they didn't force me. and i had been living inside their ugly charade they built until i couldn't take it anymore. they were asking me to sacrifice my whole being. and i was doing that. not anymore. i like this quote that goes ""before you diagnose yourself with depression or low self-esteem, first make sure that you are not, in fact, just surrounded by assholes.""

206,"being gay is a curse. an affliction. the only cure for it is leaving  i was gay since i was very little,  before i even knew what it was or had seen or heard of it as a concept. i remember i was like 6 or 7 and the commercial for the first harry potter movie came in the tv and i had my first little crush. i had crushes like that until around 11 or 12 when i hit puberty, then the physical changes happened and i really knew what i was. and i knew what gay was by then but from then on, until 8th grade,  every day i'd tell myself ""don't worry, you're fine, this won't last, you'll be normal soon"". i'd also pray every night for ""god"" to make me normal. when i got to 8th grade, i realized it wasn't a phase and there was no ""god"" who was going to cure me.  that's the time i had suicidal ideation.

every year that went by,  the more i learned and experienced just how despised my kind are by most people. and every year i felt worse and worse. and i learned to hate myself at the very core. there's part of me that every time i look in the mirror, all i see are every single words that people think of me as. i'm a blight that's infecting this world. i'm a demonic, satanic, degenerate, perverted, sick fucking freak who has no place here. it doesn't even matter if i believe it or not,  the fact is most people in this world do, and that's all that matters. to them, i am one of the worst things one can possibly be and i am incompatible with a good society and a threat to the very foundation of family. 

i have other issues as well, typical life bs. no friends, hardly any family. still don't have  a career. fat. the place i'm in right now with all that is mostly my fault, i see that now. i've sabotaged myself so many times are purposefully wrecked so many good opportunities because of that self hatred i hold. its like i could never allow myself to succeed because i don't think i deserve it.  and i guess i don't. 

throughout the years i've had small slivers of hope or moments where i tried to just push through and live the best i can. i went back to school this past semester to try and do what i've always wanted to. but then the election happened and it truly cemented what i've always known. in a way it's a good thing, like a band aid being ripped off. they want me gone and it kind of makes it easier because i know that leaving actually makes so many people truly happy. there's tons more of my kind out there but at least i'm doing my part. i dropped my classes, quit my job and i'm just wrapping things up. before spring is ideal..there's something really comforting about the cold and earlier darkness.

also it really fucking pisses me off and makes me think about life and what this all is, if anything. i never asked to be what i am. i didn't want to be a homosexual, i never chose it. the natural opinions of us by the vast majority of people make it clear that we shouldn't exist. i'm just unlucky that i end up with this infliction. despite all of that, it's still hard to actually do but i know it's the only option that makes sense. it's inhumane that safe, legal options aren't available to leave ",1,1

215,"just feeling guilty. just came across a call recording of my ex bestfriend(m) whom i(f) had a crush on . our friendship got fucked up when another girl(call her a) jumped in the scenario. i didn't know much about her but i started being friends with her with my other friend(call her b) so then shit got messed up more and more . 
the a girl started dating my crush even after being aware that i liked him.  she just came and within 2 weeks he was hers. i got so stressed that i got sick. she made fun of it and said that i was faking it . she was always negative to me that i am flat and dark skinned while comparing herself to me and telling that she is better and ending it by saying it's just a joke. 
soon after they started dating i cut off contact with my crush because she was a bit jealous types but she wouldn't show it. and apparently he got very emotional and cried and stuff . so after that him and i rarely spoke . 
after some weeks their relationship started fluctuating. they used to take breaks and stuff . and whenever they used to take breaks he used to contact me saying i'm lonely and all . which obv i felt used . so one day that girl said smtg to me and she didn't clarify it which i should've maybe kept it with me .
 and soon after 1 or 2 months my friendship with a also started going downhill . soon i ended friendship with a . meanwhile me and b became close and we are still besties . after a was gone b told me about the things a used to say. i was hurt . but i let it go . and a's exes told me stories about her(which was basically her being a cheater), which i tried telling my crush so that he doesn't get hurt . but that day when i told he sort of listened to me and was nice. next day he started behaving rude and said those are all fake stories . i agreed to it and i just backed off .
 so i told this whole story including that unclarified text message . i told around 4 close ppl of mine. one of those close people was her current bestie(call her v) . but during that time v hated a and a hated v too . so while telling it just slipped and i told the whole thing to v . i didn't know v would go and tell everyone about that unclarified text. it spread like a wildfire and i wasn't aware of it. then my crush and a would call and ask why i did that . 
but actually it wasn't me who told anyone . and i would get so overwhelmed i would just avoid talking about it . only me and b knew that it was v but it was too late . i found out that v was the culprit an year after all this happened. i felt guilty about it . this wholeeeee thing has left a deep trauma on me and whenever i see any of them i go numb asf. nobody understands it . and i'm not saying i'm innocent in this whole thing , but i didn't intend to do that too . i didn't want to spread rumours about them but yeah . now i don't want to sort it out with them too . but i sometimes sit and wonder where did it all go wrong . anyways i didn't want a in my life . but that guy atleast as a friend maybe yeah. i wouldn't have dated him but that bond is gone . i was sooo cheerful and bubbly when it was him. when he was gone from my life , i lost myself too . 
now i'm happy in my relationship no doubt . it's not like i miss him in that way but i just miss him as a friend or atleast that he should've just been there if not involved in my life . i just wanted to get it off. any advices would be appreciated too.",1,1

i have a fear of being elderly and alone. i am divorced, don't have kids, and don't have many friends. i'm afraid of living in an old folks home and just being forgotten about. and then today i realized that i pretty much already am forgotten about. i moved across the country a couple years ago, none of my family or friends ever call me. my mom never calls, my sister doesn't call. the only time my best friwnd messages me is to complain about her life. she never asks me how i'm doing or what's going on with me. i'm always the one calling them, and if i don't we simply don't talk. it's like my fear of being alone has come true, the only difference is i'm younger and able to take care of myself still. i do have an amazing boyfriend, but lately i keep screwing shit up so i wouldn't doubt it if he left me soon too.

so ya. it may not be today or tomorrow, it might even be 10 or 20 years from now. but unless i have an accident of some sort this will probably be how i die.

hi everyone, i just need to vent because i feel kind of ridiculous being so emotional and upset about this. i (26 f) was in a relationship with my ex (40 m) a few years ago. back in 2019, i moved from california to arkansas to be with him after dating long distance for a few months. at the time, i was in a rough spot with my family, and he convinced me to move in with him (though he denies ever doing that). in hindsight, we weren't very compatible, and after facing a lot of disrespect from his family—who were racist toward me because i'm mexican—i decided i couldn't take it anymore and moved back to california in 2021.
being young and hopeful, i thought the relationship might still work out, so we kept up with the long-distance thing. before leaving arkansas, i left behind some of my things, including my cow plushie collection, which holds a lot of sentimental value. some of the plushies were given to me by my father, who passed away in 2015, and others were from my grandmother, who passed in 2024.
the last time i saw him was christmas 2021, and i asked him to pack up my stuff and send it to me. he agreed, but ""forgot."" we broke up in march 2022, and since then, i've been asking him to send my things, especially my cows. i don't care about anything else; i just want my plushies. but he keeps saying it's not a priority for him, and it's ""not on his radar.""
i know it's a big ask, but i've offered to pay for shipping, give him extra money, or even come pick them up myself. he says he's not busy, but the response is always the same. i last spoke to him a few days ago about it, and he said it's not a priority and he's not sure if he even has my stuff but that he'll clean out his attic or barn to check.
i'm so frustrated and feel powerless. part of me knows i should just let it go, but i can't seem to. i feel like i'm being strung along, and i'm exhausted from crying and pleading for something that should be simple. it just feels like a power move on his part to keep communication going, and i'm done with him.
i know it might sound ridiculous to be so upset over stuffed animals, but they mean a lot to me. if anyone has advice on how to either get him to send them or how to let go of this, i'd really appreciate it. thank you.

253,"i was raped by my girlfriend i am a 36-year-old guy and i was raped fifteen years ago by my then-girlfriend, who was 19.

i was 21 and she was the cutest girl probably on campus, and we took half the same classes. i was literally head over heels with her and after a few months, i asked her out and she said yes. we went on two or three dates and i thought i'd found the one. this girl was amazing, she was beautiful, really smart, and fun to be around.

she was driving us back from a restaurant on the fourth date, i think it was, when she stopped the car off on a side road all of a sudden. i looked at her, and she went on top of me. i tried to push her off but she pinned my hands down and started kissing me. i asked her what was up, and she said she was going to ""reward"" me by having sex together for the first time. i tried to say i wasn't really in the mood, it had been a long day and i wanted our first time to be more special but she'd already unbuttoned my pants. i really tried to get her off then but as much as it sucks to admit it, i'm not a very big guy and this girl was strong enough to keep me down. i decided to just let her go on, maybe she'd get tired. after her getting on me, though, i'd had enough.  
""i'm done,"" i told her. but we had already started. her eyes were closed and she went on for about five more minutes before she got off and i sat up and buttoned my pants.  
""you raped me,"" i said, and she laughed out loud. i honestly think she didn't believe she had raped me, because i was a guy and guys always want sex, don't they?  
""you're welcome,"" she said and she put the car into gear as if everything was fine. i let her drive us up back to my dorm which was only a few minutes away and when she tried to follow me, i told her i felt really sick and would catch her later. she scoffed but left and i went upstairs and just lay there all night long, not able to sleep.

i told my roommates the other day what had happened and they both clapped me on the back, telling me ""good job"". i decided i wasn't raped. there's no way a guy could get raped by a girl two years younger than him.  
i tried to forget about it. when she texted me a few days later asking if i wanted to go to this party her friend was throwing, i went, and then before it was over, pulled her aside and broke up with her. i blocked her out and ignored my friends telling me ""she got away"" and i made a huge mistake.  
for fifteen years, i've been telling myself nothing happened to me, i'm not a pu\*\*y, i didn't get raped by a girl.

today i admit it. yeah, i was raped. yeah, she was two years younger than me. yeah, i'm a guy. i don't fucking care. i was raped. i was raped and it's destroyed me, been destroying me since the day it happened.

255,"i have pretty bad dyslexia, but for the first time as an adult i've read 3 full books since the beginning of august! 3 whole books! i have no one to tell, because it's not really an achievement, but to me it feels like a big deal, the highlight of my year. no one around me really seems to care, because if we are being honest, it's not really that big a deal, especially because i am a grown man of 31yrs old. 
but to me this has been such an invigorating achievement!
  
  
 all my life i have struggled with my reading, comprehension and learning. it's not that i cannot read, i can, it's just that it always feels like a huge chore, i get mixed up at times and have to re-read, and wherever possible i always avoid reading out loud, as some how i get things muddled up in my head and never read things accurately. i made my way through my school days always messing up and being teased and laughed at because of the slow pace of my reading. because of this i made a big effort to make sure that as best i could i would never allow my professional career to be effected, i wanted to insure that all my emails and work would be of the highest standard, i wouldn't allow myself to look stupid as an adult. which for the most part i have been able to do, but a quick glance at my posts and comments will show that i am still prone to mistakes, which of course on reddit means you are totally spell and grammar checked instantly and belittled if you slip up. reading even on here mostly feels like work, it takes my brain a large amount of extra effort to accurately read anything, i get ""strain"" headaches and quickly tire when reading, even if it's short titles on posts. 
 
 
so for me reading has never been my idea of fun or enjoyable, it's always been a step towards learning or work and i've never gotten beyond that with my attempts at reading for pleasure. i am a big fan of military history and of medical study to do with emergency medicine or first aid, i even studied at becoming a paramedic for a short time before my study opportunity was abruptly ended. so in a way i find those subjects the easiest to begin to read in. one of the first books i've ever read that wasn't because of study or school, was the diary of anne frank, it took me 2yrs to finish cover to cover, but i was 17yrs old and it was my first ever book away from school and i still felt accomplished! i found a series of books, 4 in total that were first hand fictional stories based around the real conquest of genghis khan, imagined stories about his planning and conversations etc. i took me 7yrs to complete the books, but at 26yrs i decided that recreational reading wasn't for me. at age 29 after watching the series band of brothers for about the 50th time, i brought myself major richard ""dick"" winters book, recounting the events of wwii from his vantage point. it combined my love of military history with my love of the tv series, and over a 6 month period i read the book. but it still really really took so much effort. 
 
 
now with covid-19 effecting everything, and a prolonged bout of severe illness on top of my disability, combined with a less than ideal living situation and battling my chronic depression after attempted suicide earlier in the year, i found myself with a tremendous amount of time, isolated in my tiny bedroom bored out of my mind which was further whittling at my mental health. i picked up a book entitled sas: ghost patrol, which was a historic telling of the very beginnings of the sas fighting with a special unit known as the long range desert group, who specialised in crazy daring deadly raids on the nazis in northern africa during wwii, and focused on a hugely brave and bold attack on a nazi port of tobruk. i began reading, and soon i was realising that i was reading well into the early hours of the night, night after night! and just like that i had finished the book, in less than 3 weeks! i had actually thoroughly enjoyed it! then i picked up the next, and then the next and soon within a short 8+/- weeks i had completed 3 books, three entire books read and most crucially enjoyed! i am so excited and proud of myself! i just had to tell someone. i have just picked up my next booked entitled ""march battalion by sven hassel""!  thank you for listening.

256,"my dog died terribly and i feel horrible lying to my mom about it. short little rant, but it feels like i need to tell someone. 

we took my dog of 16 years to be put out today. he was well past his time and suffering, and the date was long overdue. i arrived at the vet, they weighed him, and took him to the vets office. this is where everything kinda went to shit for my boy. he felt scared and didn't know what was going on around him, since he has trouble walking for too long so me and my family never take him on long walks, and when we go to the beach with him it's always quiet, so he's not used to many other people or strange smells. i was trying my best to calm him, but when the vet came in he was still rather anxious and it didn't help when they tried sticking a catheter into the top of his paw. he tried with his other paw to scrape it off and that forced the assistants to have to hold him down (he's a big labrador). after struggling for a few minutes, the vet told us to stand outside and he gave my boy a sedative.  
  
 we could hear him howling and crying from outside, and i felt terrible leaving him. when we came back in he was lying down hyperventilating with a catheter in his lower paw. the vet then injected the euthanasia, and look, i've seen dogs go to sleep before, but mine didn't lower his head peacefully and close his eyes, no, he started crying louder, and then the muscle contractions started, but he was still howling and crying out. the doctor quickly injected a second dose of euthanasia, but as he was doing it, his muscles were still contracting, so a big spurt of blood came out when the catheter opened up. it was harrowing watching him continue to cry out while his hearth stopped. it probably took around 2 minutes, all while the dog was scared, confused and feeling alone. the vet's best explanation was that the sedative slowed down his heart making the euthanasia take longer, which caused the botched attempt,  and that sucks. it was terrible to watch, but i'm glad i was with him until the end. 

i know how my mom would react if she knew. i told my dad how it happened first, and he told me i should tell my mom our dog died peacefully. i hate lying to her, especially when the truth is so much worse, but at the same time i don't want to upset her. this whole thing just sucks. it sucks that the euthanasia was botched. it sucks that my dog was not in a good space before or during. it sucks that i have to lie to my mom to keep her heart from breaking.

sorry if the writing is bad, i don't really care if this gets any engagement. i just felt i needed to get the truth off my chest, so i searched up this sub and viola. for anyone wanting to euthanize their pet, just make sure the vet knows what's its doing. ",1,1

i cant handle life, its to hard, everyday something negative is happening, i cant breathe without pain, constantly something bad happens. and yes there is a few good things in my life, but it is sufficated by all the bad parts. im going to therapy, and i recently got out of a mental hospital, but nothing positive has happened. and i know i have a good future, i know it takes time, i know all that shit. im not willing to wait. no future is worth this pain. i have no one irl. i have a barely existing mom, a lil sis who is the golden child that uses it for her advantage against me. i had a few escapes besides self harm to keep my away from suicide, like playing the piano, and the guitar. but the piano broke and i dont have the money to get it fixed, and i have to give my guitar away to my stepdad (my mom and him divorced and its technically his guitar) so i have no distractions. recently i got broken up with by someone i thought i would be with forever and that has hurt. rn im constantly alone, with only one person helping me, but he has been gone alot recently. idk what else besides suicide to do, waiting for it to get better is not an option, and i cant do anything to make my life better. self harm is the only reason im here rn. i wanna live i rlly do, i want to have a great life, i just cant handle waiting any longer. im not even sure if ill be able to handle one more hour, please help",1,1

edit: first off i'd like to say thank you to everyone that has reached out to me privately and in the comments. i did not expect any of that. also, i'll share my story for those that have asked. 

when i was a child i was abused mentally and physically by my parents and grandmother. despite the abuse i loved my parents and looked up to them, they divorced when i was 7 and i was completely devastated by the fact that my father was never going to come back home. the abuse did not stop however until i was in my early teens. in high school i was extremely depressed, had few friends and never a significant other. never any aspirations for the future. when i graduated i went to live with my dad, that experience ended when we had physical altercation which resulted in him having a broken finger. he and i do not have a good relationship to this day. in the 7 years since, i have tired but have failed many times to get through college. ive had many failed relationships that ended because i was always lied to and cheated on. ive been addicted to various drugs over the years and i feel that my brain has turned to mush. though now i only smoke weed and drink often. recently i've gone through a break up that i feel has tipped me over the edge. we used to live together and we were happy for a while. for the first time in my life i felt that i had a purpose. i thought i could build a future with her, which is something i was never able to visualize with anyone else. for the first time in my life, i saw a future that wasn't grim and full of failure. unfortunately i could not meet her expectations and she ended the relationship. we've been sleeping together almost weekly and each time i feel that there's a chance i can fix things. but she shoots me down each time. about a week ago she told me she's taking a job that will require her to travel for 13 weeks at a time. she will be leaving in late august. before i even got this news i was already planning on ending my life. i had my suicide note ready. i've been packing things away and trashing other things. so that my loved ones won't have to. but now i'm afraid that when she leaves i will not have the strength to push through until december.",1,1

 when i was 13 i told the school counsellor that i had suicidal ideation, and was taken out of school and put to online school, and move in with my grandparents so i could be watched. despite this, my parents, and entire family really didn't take it seriously. i'm separated from my dad so i don't see him often, and he's not really involved, but my mum didn't believe that i was suicidal at all, and just thought i was trying to get out of school. 

after this, i'm now 17, and have struggled with depression throughout the years, however no one notices, or believes anything. they attribute my behaviours and feelings to being emotional, hormonal, or being a bad kid/person. 

i'm at the point where, i truly believe i could attempt if i find the means. how can i help them realise, and save me? i don't think they care about me enough in the first place to bother, but it's possible also that they're too afraid to let themselves believe i'm suicidal and have intentions to go through with it.

i'm also on day 17 of lexapro(escitalopram). i don't know if this is whats causing the suicidal thoughts or not, but it's getting worse, and i just wish someone would take me seriously. 

i don't know what i should say or do. i'm scared i will stress them out if i tell them, even if they don't take it seriously. so maybe i should just do it, and then they won't have to bother any longer.

340,"on new year's day, i wrote the first half of my note. five out of these past six years have been nothing but hell for (24m) me. it's just been nothing but failures, self-loathing, weakness, sorrow and loneliness. 
* every goal that i set to do, has been slowly burning away. either due to failure and my inability to find a competent alternative, or simple inactivity. when i fuck up on one thing, i sort of obsess over fixing it and i ignore everything else. 
* no matter how hard i try, i don't amount to anything. my existence or presence is never enough! kindness and sense of humor is not enough for good relationships:
    * my interpersonal, logical and even emotional intelligence is in a very poor state. i end up portraying the funny (and i'm barely that), but idiotic buff guy or the hard, vapid and shy dude in my friend groups. idk if i'm on the spectrum or just have social anxiety & general awkwardness. not to mention, i'm not very innovative or astute. 
    * i'm look much to look at. i don't have pretty eyes, nice hair, a good sense of style or masculine charm at all. i'm 6'2, deep-voiced and muscular but overweight. (even with all of my dieting and exercise, i can't escape being that fat, ugly kid with a constant chip on his shoulder) i've a lot on not being bitter, it's poisonous. although, there's still a good dose of edginess that's still curdling. my resentful, vindictive and determined, yet brutal thoughts are a testament to it. that's why i try to keep it in control, because i'm scared of that fragment of me.
    * confidence is a concept that i've never fully grasped. my athletic ability, intelligence and personality have never been things that i can count on. sure, i can feign confidence  and i'm exactly afraid of making mistakes…but i'm afraid of making myself look weak or trash at things. do you know how many times a day that i think about building upon my interest or even ask more girls for her number, but never could because i'm a fucking pussy?? finally, it's began to fuck with my identity. i've started to paint the persona or me that's ""interesting"" and ""unique"". let me just say it now: i'm not this caribbean dude with this interesting story on how i got here, i'm just a regular black guy from the midwest. there i said it! 
    * never had an actual gf. i'm not a virgin but i haven't experienced any form of strong intimacy in a very long time. where somebody understands and trusts me as i do them. you know? as i list all of these things, no wonder nobody wants to date me. i'm not confident, super disciplined, ambitious or assertive (i stand up for others but rarely for myself). nothing about me is manly or worthy.
    * lastly, i basically fucked up my future because i was too weak to adjust to my overall grades are definitely not graduate school quality. to think that my cretinous-ass could be a neuropsychologist. plus, my parents think that i'm graduating this semester. i just told them that to ease their minds from their funds.at the moment, there's no future in sight that i want to experience. 

""listen, i'm going to give my absolute best attempt at achieving something significant in this life, but if i'm unsuccessful…december 31st, 2025 will be my last day with all of you. i'll write out the goodbyes, the apologies and that'll be it. remember when i told you that i don't break promises, well i made this promise to myself at 18 and i intent to keep my streak! the least pussy thing that i'll ever do is be a man of my word, right? you can find me on the ceiling in my room, you can't miss it.""
