    "selftext": "Years ago, I worked at a Home Depot warehouse. It was steady work, nothing special, but it felt secure enough for me to get by. For a while, I thought I could just keep my head down and exist there, unnoticed. But that all changed after one night‚Äîand my life hasn‚Äôt been the same since.\n\nShe was a coworker, someone I occasionally ran into at a bar. We knew a lot of the same people outside of work, and we‚Äôd had casual conversations about them before. One night, she walked behind me at the bar, and I asked her a question, just small talk. Things seemed fine until she said something that struck me the wrong way.\n\nI didn‚Äôt handle it well‚ÄîI shut down, stonewalled her completely. When she kept talking, I waved my hand sarcastically, brashly, and told her to leave me alone. She looked offended, but I thought it was over, just one awkward moment that would be forgotten by morning.\n\nBut it wasn‚Äôt forgotten. The next day, everything fell apart.\n\nShe went to human resources and told them I‚Äôd yelled at her, followed her home, stalked her outside of her apartment. To this day, I still don‚Äôt know the full details of what she said about me. Instead, HR started interrogating me, asking questions that felt more like accusations:  \n‚ÄúDo you know what kind of car she drives?‚Äù  \n‚ÄúDo you know where she lives?‚Äù\n\nI didn‚Äôt. I couldn‚Äôt have answered those questions even if I wanted to. But my ignorance didn‚Äôt matter. I could feel the judgment in their tone, in their eyes. It was as if they‚Äôd already decided I was guilty.\n\nFrom that moment on, the warehouse became a minefield. The managers stared at me like I was something rotten, something they wanted to get rid of. Every glance was heavy with judgment and disdain. The other employees weren‚Äôt any better‚Äîwhispers followed me everywhere I went, loud enough to let me know they were talking about me.\n\nEvery day, I walked into that warehouse feeling smaller, more isolated, more powerless. And eventually, they fired me.\n\nI thought losing my job would be the end of it, but the nightmare followed me beyond the warehouse walls. The bar where I used to go to unwind‚Äîthe one place that felt like a safe haven‚Äîturned against me too.\n\nShe was dating one of the bartenders there. After everything that happened, I decided to try talking to him. I wanted to clear my name, to tell him that she‚Äôd lied about me. But as soon as I brought it up, he flipped out. He wouldn‚Äôt even let me explain, wouldn‚Äôt listen to a word I had to say. He told me to leave, and that was that‚Äîone more place I‚Äôd been shut out of, one more piece of my life taken from me.\n\nAnd now, years later, I‚Äôm still living with the weight of it all. PTSD is what they call it, but that label doesn‚Äôt capture what it feels like. The way your chest tightens, your heart races, your mind spirals into memories you can‚Äôt escape. The way your body reacts before you can even process what‚Äôs happening.\n\nI can‚Äôt walk into a crowded bar or a workplace without feeling like everyone is staring at me, judging me. I can‚Äôt escape the fear that someone will make another false accusation and take away whatever stability I‚Äôve managed to rebuild.\n\nI didn‚Äôt deserve this. I didn‚Äôt deserve to lose my job, my reputation, or my peace of mind over one interaction. I didn‚Äôt deserve to be exiled from places that once felt like home. And the worst part? I still don‚Äôt know the full extent of what she said. I only know the damage it caused‚Äîand I‚Äôve been living with the consequences every day since.\n\nI‚Äôm trying to heal, but some days, it feels impossible. The stares, the whispers, the rejection‚Äîthey‚Äôre etched into me like scars I can‚Äôt see but will always feel.\n\nIf you‚Äôve read this far, thank you. It means something to be heard, even by strangers. And if you‚Äôve been through something like this, know that you‚Äôre not alone.",

    "title": "From Survivor to Thriver: My Journey with Complex PTSD",
    "selftext": "For most of my life, I thought I had made peace with my past. My childhood was marred by horrific sexual and physical abuse. One of my earliest childhood memories is realizing that to protect myself, I could hide in the boxspring of one of the family beds and stay quiet so my abuser wouldn‚Äôt find me.\n\nI‚Äôve always had an extraordinary memory. Like many dyslexics, I experience the world through vivid, moving pictures rather than an inner dialogue. This ability helped me overcome challenges in life and thrive in my career, but it‚Äôs also a double-edged sword. The same memory that allowed me to retain information with incredible clarity can replay events from my past over and over again in graphic detail. It creates a kind of torture that‚Äôs hard to explain, as I relive moments I desperately want to forget in perfect, painful clarity.\n\nWork became my escape. It was my anchor to a sense of normalcy. In my role, I was able to help others, and it gave me a feeling of being less damaged, less defined by my past.\n\nBut then I worked for¬†*my former employer.*¬†They were a company that touted themselves as a shining example of ethics and excellence, yet their treatment of employees painted a very different picture. I stood up for not just ethical issues but also possible financial improprieties, refusing to look the other way when I saw wrongdoing. I believed it was my duty to protect the integrity of the organization and the people it served. Instead, I paid the price. The retaliation was relentless.\n\nI stayed with this company for more than seven years, even after my PTSD was retriggered by an assault outside of work. I went on short-term disability to try to heal and was placed on anti-anxiety medication. But the medication came with devastating side effects, including severe cognitive dulling.\n\nAs someone who overcame dyslexia to become a high-functioning leader, this was shattering. My brain had learned to process words by the page instead of word by word, allowing me to absorb and retain information at an extraordinary speed. Reading and memory were not just my tools‚Äîthey were my superpower.\n\nBut on this medication, I lost the ability to read. Suddenly, all my childhood struggles came rushing back. I would look at words and they no longer made sense. The moving pictures in my mind became scattered and incoherent. I felt like I was losing myself. Combined with the bizarre behavior I had never exhibited before‚Äîlike driving aimlessly around my town for hours with nowhere to go, mood swings, and an all-consuming sadness‚Äîit left me terrified. I didn‚Äôt recognize who I had become. In some ways, this loss of control and identity felt even worse than the PTSD retrigger itself.\n\nAs if that wasn‚Äôt enough, I faced betrayal from my employer. A Human Resources disability manager accessed my behavioral health records without my consent and confronted me about the sexual abuse I endured as a child and my dyslexia. She told me I couldn‚Äôt use my past as an ‚Äúexcuse‚Äù to avoid my work obligations and said my claims would be denied because the company wasn‚Äôt willing to let me take the time I needed to recover.\n\nWhen I reported this interaction to leadership, I thought they would act ethically. Instead, they moved to protect their own. Despite confirmation from the short-term disability provider that the HR manager had accessed my behavioral health information, nothing was done. Their lack of accountability left me feeling more betrayed than ever.\n\nWhen my disability claim was denied, I returned to the company. But the retaliation for my ongoing ethics reporting of improprieties (outside of the HR conversation about my disability benefits) became too much. On one occasion, the company outright lied on a document that had to be affirmed as true and accurate‚Äîdespite the form explicitly stating that providing false information was a crime in my state. When I elevated this to senior leadership, my whistleblowing was met with a cease and desist letter.\n\nThis letter triggered the largest panic attack I‚Äôve ever had. I was left numb, unable to process what had just happened. It was during the recovery from this event that I knew I had to take a stand, protect myself, and leave this toxic environment. For the first time in years, I realized that to be better, I needed to evaluate what was best for me. I had spent so long putting others ahead of myself that it was time to put myself first.\n\nWith the help of my incredible husband, my therapist, my doctors, and even my pets, I began to rebuild. I left that toxic workplace and found an employer that truly embodies the ethics they preach. They treat me well and encourage me to set healthy boundaries. I‚Äôm no longer a workaholic, but I‚Äôll admit that the joy I once felt for my industry was stolen by that other company.\n\nPTSD is a brutal, unrelenting battle, but you are not alone in this fight. You are stronger than you think, braver than you realize, and far more valuable than the darkest moments in your life would have you believe. If you‚Äôre reading this, know that you are important. You matter. You are loved.\n\nHealing is not linear, and it‚Äôs okay to stumble or feel overwhelmed. It doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôve failed‚Äîit means you‚Äôre human. Together, as a community, we can support each other through this journey. There are resources, people who care, and a wealth of understanding from those who have walked this path before. Lean on this community, and never be afraid to reach out.\n\nTo anyone enduring complex PTSD: you are not defined by your trauma. You are defined by your strength to keep going. Each step forward, no matter how small, is a victory. I salute every single one of you who continues to endure, persevere, and grow. And to the loved ones and therapists who stand by our sides in our darkest hours, you are the light that helps us rebuild. Thank you for everything you do.\n\nEven in the darkest times, there is hope. Healing takes time, but it is possible. You are worthy of happiness, peace, and love. Don‚Äôt ever forget that. Stay strong, and remember: you‚Äôre not just surviving‚Äîyou‚Äôre thriving.",

    "selftext": "CW: Childhood Truama, Suicide\n\nBalance‚ÄìReflections on Hope\n\nI wobble and fall when I try to walk now.\nThe doctors are uncertain why,\nneurological, psychological, physical \nor maybe a bit of all three. \n\nBalance is the issue at hand.\nBut it has always been the issue.\nNow it is simply manifesting itself visibly. \n\nMy foundation of life was not stable. \nI did not have a secure childhood.\nThere was profound abuse involved. \nIt left me traumatized and splintered.\n\nThe balance, most young people develop\ndid not develop in me.\nI was self-destructive in every aspect of life, physical, mental, or spiritual. \nThe Marines gave me cause to maintain control and discipline. It gave me purpose. \n\nThe hallucinations and alters (which I only understood as time loss) were manageable and when managed, I appeared ‚Äúnormal‚Äù.\n\nNormality, for those who live with it and never have to strive for it; is something that is easy. Yet, those of us who must struggle for it, it is far from easy.\nStriving for some abstract concept of acceptable behavior, when what is acceptable behavior is always changing, is exhausting and problematic.\nIt creates its own dissonance, and explains why the suicide rate is so high in LGBTQ+ youth. When you cannot achieve an always changing definition of ‚Äúnormal‚Äù appearance, hopelessness is created and far too many suffer the ultimate consequences. This was equally my dilemma. \n\nThe balance of my life was barely maintained while in the Marines. I learned liquor was an enemy. I rarely got out of control drunk. Sex was abused, as an escape from my trauma, even as sex was part of my trauma. I maintained few associates and fewer friends. Contact to the ‚Äúreal world‚Äù was to only a handful of people, that while they had no clue to my trauma, I trusted them. This life was maintained for a decade before being medically retired after ten years of service.\n\nI was destroyed when retired. So much so that it led to my first suicide attempt. How I survived I cannot say. I pulled the trigger, the pistol fired, and yet, I missed my temple. Miracle or jerking the trigger, take your pick. This eventually brought me to a fellow veteran who saw in me‚Äìdefeat. He reached out, listened without judgment and then convinced me to seek help. Time would pass. Therapy and medication together brought me to a place of control. Enough that I started my next chapter‚ÄìAcademia. \n\nAcademia became my second love. Like the Marines It required a focused mind. Unlike the Marines it allowed for many ways to be academic. I attended what is now Augustana University in Sioux Falls SD for undergraduate studies, then Seminary in the Twin Cities for my Master‚Äôs and finally the University of Mumbai for my PhD. The voices were, well not completely controlled, manageable. The alters, which I still only perceived as time losses, were there but not problematic. Life was at best fine, on a scale from 1--10 with 10 being the best, it was a 6. \n\nI progressed through life being fine, many people do. It wasn't until I had completed my studies that the wall of distraction, i \n built, came tumbling down. I went through years of hospitalizations, changing and adjusting medications. The one factor that made life remotely pleasant was my wife. I had somehow developed a relationship with an angel, who loved me, for the person I am. She knew the trauma, saw the scars, wept with me and hugged me tightly when I suffered. She is the reason I am alive today.\n\nThrough countless suicide attempts and months in a locked psych ward she stood with me. She rallied to my care. She governed how it was applied, ensuring the best possible care and potential outcome. For some unknown reason this beautiful woman loved me, and fortunately for me, she still does. She has been the stability in my life. She brought me balance. When everything else was treating symptoms her love was healing me‚Äìinteresting how love can do that.\n\nToday, I am more balanced than I have ever been. The hallucinations are well managed. The alters come out to play when they know it is safe. Other than that they seem content to allow me to remain driving the bus. The one lasting dilemma is the nightmares. Those remain unchecked. Every night, more than one a night, I am faced with the nightly haunting. They are now a blending of childhood and military trauma. They are oh so delightful. I wake from them often discombobulated and nearly always dazed. The after effects last minutes to hours. It depends on the severity and if I can escape the nightmare. Medication has not helped and I have yet to find a therapy that has lessened their power.\n\nBut I am blessed. I am the luckiest man alive. I have a healed, abiding faith. I have my friends and family that hover over me, protecting and caring for me. And just as important, I have the Veterans Hospital to care for all my medical needs. I am the luckiest man alive.

    "selftext": "Hi!\n\nMy husband and I were in a car crash. Car flipped on the road a few times. He was badly injured resulting in emergency surgery, i came out with a few bruises. We got blue lighted to a hospital about 2-3h away, my husband was sick all throughout the ambulance journey.The experience of the night before the surgery in the hospital ward was really bad. My husband was sick, vomiting, almost choking on his own vomit several times. Support staff were incompetent, they did not know they shouldn't move my husband, I kept yelling at them to not touch him. When he was sick I was running in the ward to get competent staff, while leaving my husband chocking and yelling at the support staff not to try move him (because they wanted to sit him up and he was meant to lay flat on his back, and be moved with more people, due to him breaking 2  vertebras in his back and paralysis danger). They gave him pills without water and again I lost it with them, as he was vomiting 5 minutes earlier.\nEventually I managed to advocate for better staff that looked after him as they should. Post curgery he was moved to a different ward with proper support.\nI was very traumatised by my experience in the ward which was about 8-10h after the accident.\nNow I am home, 4 weeks after tha accident and hospital and my anxiety is still there. I spoke to the GP they gave me propanolol. I take it almost every day, but only when I feel really anxious...it's mostly evenings and at night... my heart beats fast, takes me 2 hours to fall asleep, I toss and turn, i feel tired but i dont sleep and feel rested wake up startled at every noise my hisband makes sleeping. I started wearing earplugs to muffle any sound and moved to sleep in a different room, so I get some sleep.\nI feel very agitated and fragile inside. \nI feel sick having to go back to work, having to face a mess on my return as the other managers haven't done anything to resolve some issues in my absence. I need to go back to work, we don't have much money left.\nAnyway.... I am in general in tune with all my emotions, but I am not able to get a grip on this anxiety. All my life I have been okay (tough cookie), I coped fine with any anxiety, I never needed medication, but I am not able to escape how agitated I feel inside and be able to feel in control. I know it's all in my head and yet I can't overcome it.\nI exercise 4 times a week (weightlift), I take daily walks, I go to a weekly dance class, I meet up with friends, I stopped watching news, I do streching, take supplements...nothing seems to work... I am able to rationalise all that is happening with me in that moment, but still feeling very heightened and agitated.\nHas anybody gone through something similar?\n\nP.S - I am not looking for advice to sue the hospital or anything like that. I already spoke with the management. I am not looking for a lengthy legal battle. All, I want is the staff just to do better for other patients that might not be able to advocate for themselves. ",

Father was very physically abusive (not sexually that I know of).\nMy childhood is a blank. I can't remember most of it. I do remember tho that I was pleasuring myself around 6 years old. I'm a male. I would always do it. Around 7 years old (that I remember) I used to masturbate to the idea of putting on my mom's make-up, and being a girl. Growing up, into early teenage years I started getting sexually attracted to everyone. Literally. My mom, sisters aunts, etc. I was a very screwed up kid. What I also vaguely remember from my childhood is that I was alone most of the time. And didn't interact much with anyone. \n\nWhen I was 12 I touched my half-sister who was I think 4 years at the time. This happened like 4-6 more times after until I was 17. I knew what I was doing was wrong only cuz I knew that being with a relative is wrong, but the fact that my actions could have hurt her, I didn't realise until I was an adult ( I used to think she liked it). I'm trying my best to be there for her now . We have a good relationship.\n\nIm attracted to women now. But the idea of being a woman is most attractive to me. Which I don't like tbh. I'd rather be normal. \n\n\nSorry for such dumping of traumatic shit. But I really wanna know why tf was I so sexually deviant at such a young age.\n\nThank you.",

However, when I was waking up and in recovery, I tried to ask for water, and my throat was so dry (I think they intubated me, but no one would confirm it to me >:( so I'm not positive) that it was hard to get the words out. The nurse in recovery screamed at me that she couldn't understand me and could I just shut up and stop trying to talk so she could do her work. I was still unable to move and this experience made me feel so unsafe. There were a few other bad experiences during this surgery, like hearing the medical team talking about me like I wasn't there while I was still awake and a few other things.\n\nI have not been diagnosed with PTSD, but I have had several panic attacks, including vomiting and numbness in my limbs from hyperventilating just thinking about having another surgery.\n\nI can't convince myself I want surgery, I don't trust my medical care team, and I feel like if anyone touches me while I'm helpless I'll feel dirty and violated and I just want to end it all rather than live in a body that's been violated like that by strangers. \n\nMy surgeon has said I could do an epidural if being under general anesthesia would be bad. Has anyone had success with fear like this? How did you get help for dealing with it? Especially anyone who has had an epidural for a surgery. It's gotten to the point that it's all I think about and my daily life is very affected.\n\nEdit: I know you can get anxiety medication beforehand, but from experience I beat myself up afterwards for anything I let them do while not \"sober\" and myself.

    "selftext": "Tw: institutional abuse\n\n\n\nSo the abuse was a combo of abuse from a person, institutional neglect, and institutional covering up of abuse. \n\n\n\nIt happened when I was pretty young, 12-13, and I self destructed for a long time after that. Pretty much ruined my life for a long time.\n\n\n\nFor a long time after I had a problem with triggering myself on purpose. Reading similar stories, looking at photos of myself at the time or photos of the building, remembering what happened, getting angry at anyone I could, looking up the primary abuser, listening to the songs that were constantly playing on the radio at the time, etc. I did it a \\*lot\\*, even though it threw me into fight-or-flight and triggered panic attacks.\n\n\n\nTried therapy, told my story to a billion therapists, tried groups, etc, but it just made things worse and I'd feel worse about myself. Few years ago I decided it just... wasn't going to be a part of my life story anymore. Pushed it down any time I thought about it, and basically decided it never happened and I'd never ever speak about it again. \n\n\n\nThing is, I'm doing better. \n\n\n\nYesterday I walked by the place it happened, for the first time since it ended, and I felt nothing. I realized I couldn't even remember what window was mine from the outside. Before I'd take a longer route just to avoid passing the area, and even thinking about the place would make my heart race, but yesterday I felt nothing.\n\n\n\nI feel like I should still feel something though. It feels wrong for it to \\*not\\* make me panic. I'm still angry that there will never, ever be any justice, and angry that my abuser ended up in an even higher position of power, but it's not the same uncontrollable rage. \n\n\n\nIt feels stupid not to be happy about this, but I feel really weird. \n\n\n\nLike, I know I had even worse anger issues, I know I had nightmares and panic attacks, I know for a while I had to sleep in my closet, I know I constantly needed to know I had an exit and couldn't walk into anywhere that needed a key to get out. But the fact I'm doing a lot better almost makes me feel like my ptsd doesn't count, or like it couldn't have been that bad. ",

While I don't have an official diagnosis every professional I have seen has agreed I have CPTSD. \nGiven that I have obviously had some horrible flashbacks in the past and ongoing that are debilitating to me and change my everyday life. For example slamming doors brings back the memory of being beaten by my dad at age 8 because the wind slammed a door and I was nearby.\nHowever within the last year or so I've had other memories come through with the same intensity as a flashback but they are really stupid. For context I have ADHD and autism and they will be memories of when I lost my fight against impulse control and said something weird far too loudly. Every time they come back my gut reaction is to slam my head against the nearest surface and they honestly can make me spiral for a good few hours. \nI don't know what to think of these memories because they obviously aren't horrible so they can't be classed as flashbacks but sometimes they really do feel just as debilitating.\nI don't know what to think and it's honestly making me spiral so I would really appreciate some advice.",

Nothing fazed me, everything just went straight over my head. I‚Äôve been a weed smoker for as long as I can remember, so you can imagine I was pretty layed back. \n\nThroughout the relationship even whilst being beat up, controlled, bullied, I still never said a word, never stuck up for myself for obvious reasons. \n\nWhen I finally got out, I felt SO LIBERATEDD I can‚Äôt even tell you the feeling. For the first few days I would dance infront of the mirror and tell myself that we did it. It‚Äôs just me and you baby, WE DID IT. \n\nFast forward a year, I‚Äôm with my new partner who could not be any sweeter to me. Lets me do whatever I want, be whoever I want.. however.. I have this crazy anger towards him when I first wake up in the morning.. I have thoughts of him cheating, I hear voices telling me that everything he says is a lie, and that he‚Äôs only with me for an easy ride.. why is this? my ex partner never cheated on me so why do I carry this paranoia with me? Why do I carry this anger that I can‚Äôt control? I can only stop these thoughts when I smoke some weed in the morning..\n\nBefore anyone says, yes I KNOW I need to quit, or certainly cut down. I‚Äôm aware of the mental problems that weed can give you especially smoking it from a young age but it‚Äôs been the only thing that‚Äôs helped me to manage my BPD, and now this PTSD journey. \n\nHas anyone experienced anything similar?

I have C-PTSD and autobiographical memory.\n\nCW: abuse, harassment, addiction, SA\n\n\nQuick recap:\nSo, I‚Äôm suffering of C-PTSD. Everything started when I was 6 to 18 years old. Many events as abuse, SA & harassment, school harassment and negligence. Both school and house was unsafe. Alcoholic and agressive in the family, every weeks I was scold by ‚Äúfriends‚Äù and manipulated at school (so I was skipping school a lot) and weekends my parents (mainly stepdad and mother) was drunk and fighting, screaming.\nAnd SA started with one in the family at the age of 12 until 18. Sadly, at school, adults were worse than children, and did nothing, and when they could, they just made it worse because my bully said: ‚ÄúBefore I was kind with you, this time I will be mean.‚Äù \n\nYou know, I dislike and like my autobiographical memory because I can remember and see everything as emotions, the places, the moments, the smells‚Ä¶ as recent memories or moments.

    "title": "Seeing normal families makes me feel like crap",
    "selftext": "It‚Äôs always been tough with my family. My mother had a traumatic upbringing‚Äîshe was unwanted as a firstborn female child and suffered violent consequences from her parents. She has severe PTSD and depression, and when I was little, she completely crashed. She hasn‚Äôt worked or pursued any education since. She spent many months in a psychiatric ward and has been on medication for decades now. \n\nMy father stuck around, but he had to work long hours to pay for everything, so he wasn‚Äôt really present either. My mother has a Stockholm syndrome-like relationship with her own mother, who‚Äôs now in her late 80s and still drags her down with constant comments about her weight and appearance. Despite this, my mother never set boundaries with her. Instead, she constantly recites her mother‚Äôs toxic comments and gossips about her behind her back.\n\nThis behavior extends to everyone‚Äîmy brother, me, even random people. She‚Äôs immature, entitled, and spends her days flipping through gossip magazines, watching TV, or meeting up with toxic ‚Äúfriends‚Äù who come and go because she can‚Äôt maintain real relationships.\n\nI moved far away from her as soon as I could, but because of the housing crisis, I ended up moving back closer. Now I see her every couple of weeks, and it‚Äôs exhausting. I‚Äôve worked hard to build a successful career and am constantly trying to improve myself, but she only sees me as a housewife. Both my partner and I work full-time, yet she‚Äôll make comments like, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you still need to cook for your husband today.‚Äù It‚Äôs infuriating.\n\nI‚Äôve been interviewing for new positions lately, and I keep hearing her toxic, minimizing voice in my head, doubting my achievements and making me feel small. I can‚Äôt stand it anymore. My dad is a good man, but he‚Äôs never stood up to her or her toxic family, which leaves me feeling so unsupported.\n\nWhat really drives it home is when I see ‚Äúnormal‚Äù families. For example, there‚Äôs a lovely woman who used to be my kindergarten teacher. When we run into each other, she‚Äôll ask thoughtful questions about my work and seem genuinely interested. My mother, on the other hand, doesn‚Äôt even understand what I do. She only asks about chores or household tasks, and it‚Äôs like she reduces my entire life to being a housewife‚Äîsomething she‚Äôs always done.\n\nI don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôve worked so hard to overcome my toxic childhood, where I was stuck with her while my father was absent working long hours. She never believed in me and constantly told me I wasn‚Äôt smart enough. Now, even when I‚Äôve achieved so much, I feel like her voice is still in my head.\n\nI need to get that voice out of my life. I can‚Äôt keep living like this, constantly feeling like I‚Äôm not enough, especially when I see glimpses of how normal, supportive families interact.\n\nWhat can I do? How can I stop letting her toxic influence control my thoughts and self-worth?",

I was self harming to cope with this at 11 but worse after all of this extra trauma. I got diagnosed with PTSD at 14. Around this time instead of self harm I started drinking and vaping and doing drugs so I didn‚Äôt have to deal with the constant memories of what happened and stuff. \n\nNow I‚Äôm such a loser.

Relationships can become strained with PTSD and moods are affected with triggers, right?\n* Also I read posts of people with cPTSD who are married or in long term relationship, holding down jobs and seem functional (pls don't take this as not believing the cPTSD diagnosis, I get that a short post doesn't tell the whole story, but it's confusing me about the definitions). Is it just differing levels of functioning for both PTSD and cPTSD?\n\nAgain, I really hope this doesn't come out as invalidating, minimising or insensitive.

But things still did. Although it was consensual when the encounters were happening, after we parted ways months later I had realized it was all tricks. They were calling me baby and claim themselves ‚Äúbf‚Äù and me ‚Äútheir woman‚Äù balabala cuz I thought them I‚Äôd want a serious relationship. But at the end they still said ‚Äúyou had wrong impression and expectation‚Äù.  Afterwards I was basically ‚Äúbegging‚Äù to see him cuz I didn‚Äôt want it to turn into a casual thing(although it still did), it lasted 1.5 months and finally he said those things and we cut off completely. \n\nI was so desperate cuz I never had any relationships or sex before that and I thought I was unworthy of it.

I also cannot help resist the sexual urge to fantasize about the encounters and to masturbate.

I just remember seeing the car and saying fuck. The next thing I know I'm waking up in the hospital with my hands tied to the bed and a breathing tube post surgery. I spent almost a month in the icu. All my injuries are on the left side of my body. I broke ribs 2 through 10, had 3 surgeries. One was life saving on a ruptured bladder. The other were both thumbs broke and needed pins and screws. And my clavicle broke and needed pinned.  I have my sternum broken and 2 vertabree t1 and t2 are broken, I had a collapsed lung, also  had a bad concussion and a massive hemotoma on my thigh the size of a football. \n\nI recently got a therapist because I haven't been able to cope mentally. I'm honestly still not there.  On the way to physical therapy the other day a bike pulled up next to us and I froze. I was the passenger thank goodness. Didn't even realize I froze. Then all of the sudden tears. The waterworks just started. Uncontrollably. All I could think about was him dying. Or my friends getting hit and dying. \n\nI wake up in the night with terrors. I am remembering more of the accident my brain blocked out. My friend was with me and confirms what I remember now is valid. She and a stranger kept holding my head telling me \"don't move and it's OK buddy you'll be ok\"\n\nI'm not educated in any of this but I was surprised that an accident could cause ptsd. I thought it was only things like war vets could get.  Please forgive my ignorance. I genuinely just didn't know. \n\nMy therapist wants to get me a new kind of therapy called EMDR therapy.  I really hope I can shake these feelings. I used to love riding. It was almost my entire personality. I've been down in the past and was able to heal and get back on a bike. Riding genuinely made me happy. It saved me from my darkest spot in life. I don't have really any other hobbies. I'm afraid I'll never get over this fear and worried I will never ride again.

He has been taking 50mg of zoloft for one year, then was recently brought up to 100mg.ocer Christmas, when he has almost Zero Social interaction with his closest friends. He went away and didnt take the zoloft. In addition he has been pro actively been on top of taking his supplements, and vitamin D.  In addition to stem cell therapy, he was also given testorone replacement therapy which he has not taken due to his wifes addiction to her cellphone, and promises she will do it but despite constant naghing of the patient she continues to forget or not communicate. He has not had had a testorone shot in 3 months. \n\nThe patient has become increasingly withdrawn and neglects his children, has completely withdrawn from his wife. They are non-speaking terms but only Co-exist for their two children. The eldest is 14 and youngest is 8. The patient concerned that the mother without notice moved to another room and both children no longer sleep as they did from the time they were born until last month.\n\nThe patient was pined to a gap and a Train smashed him in 2008 and his entire pelvis, bladder, bladder neck were destroyed. To be presice he was brought to hospital in Paris suffering from Pelvic, acetabular fractures, lost his prostate, suffers from incontinence, and erectile dysfunction. \n\nSince the accident, he has become more and more emotionally withdrawn (probably more over the past), isolated and suffers from tremor nerve pains, had an 18 hour surgery where he coded for 5 minutes from a dbt. He was in ICU for two weeks, and has had close to 7-8 months of being in bed from Orthopedic Surgeon instructions. In addition for 8 months and maybe a year from normal funcfioning this traumatic event  caused him treamandous stress being  unable to care for himself.  Ihas become a full blown addict. Physical examination shows titanium rods in lumbar of spine, left and right hip and Internal fixatures for them. Scars in his left and right legs and back. \n\nI am concerned my main concern that I am spiraling. Even though l live in Philippines I am willing to put the time to get the help I sincerely desperately need. I have contacted Standford and UCSF hospitals but I am open to suggestions for assistance in private practice.\n\nI am forever grateful for this opportunity that I can share and find support I need.\n\nFrom bottom of my heart thank you‚ù§Ô∏è",

Lately, we‚Äôve been fighting daily‚Äîor every other day for a year‚Äîabout him not showing up for me emotionally in the ways I‚Äôve clearly asked for. I‚Äôm not asking for grand gestures, but for small things, like showing interest in me or wanting to date me again.\n\nThe lack of emotional connection feels deeply triggering, as I grew up with a narcissistic parent, and this dynamic has started to mirror that. It‚Äôs sending me into a headspace where I feel like I‚Äôm losing my grip‚Äîstruggling to sleep, feeling more paranoid, and fearing a return to the psychosis I experienced years ago when emotional abuse was at its peak- i‚Äôm not saying that my partner is emotionally abusing me. It‚Äôs just triggering the same feelings I had when I was. I‚Äôve taken every approach with my partner and I‚Äôm at a point where I just don‚Äôt feel like he even likes me as a person. He claims to like me and says that he loves me, but he talks more than he does.\n\nI‚Äôm currently in therapy, medicated, and working with my doctor to adjust my medication as needed. I‚Äôve decided to stop begging for my partner to show up for me‚ÄîI‚Äôve even tried making a list of small, inexpensive date ideas to make it easier for him to engage. Nothing has changed, so I‚Äôve shifted to gray-rocking while I figure out my next steps.\n\nThis whole situation has left me crying every day, feeling emotionally raw, and honestly, just‚Ä¶ exhausted. I have a degenerative physical disability, no family, and no friends to lean on, so I‚Äôm doing my best to hold everything together. My ACE score is a 7/10, which I think can let you know my experiences without having to talk about them.\n\nIf anyone has advice on how to cope with situations like this‚Äîhow to hold onto your dreams, your sense of self, and your mental health when everything feels overwhelming‚ÄîI would really appreciate it.\n\nThank you so much for taking the time to read this.\n",

Here, we applied TMR in PTSD patients to strengthen therapeutic memories during sleep after one treatment session with eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR).\n\nEffects of TMR on sleep were assessed through high-density polysomnography. Effects on treatment outcome were assessed through subjective, autonomic, and fMRI responses to script-driven imagery (SDI) of the targeted traumatic memory and overall PTSD symptom level. Compared to sham stimulation, TMR led to stimulus-locked increases in SO and spindle dynamics, which correlated positively with PTSD symptom reduction in the TMR group. Given the role of SOs and spindles in memory consolidation, these findings suggest that TMR may have strengthened the consolidation of the EMDR-treatment memory. Clinically, TMR vs. sham stimulation resulted in a larger reduction of avoidance level during SDI. TMR did not disturb sleep or trigger nightmares. Together, these data provide first proof of principle that TMR may be a safe and viable future treatment augmentation strategy for PTSD.",

    "title": "Do I have PTSD, severe depression or something else?",
    "selftext": "I never had depression, panic attacks, or sleep problems, but that all changed in December when I started taking high doses of methylated B12. I would also like to add that I do not work. I am at home with my family.\n\nAfter two weeks of taking the vitamin (December 13), I had severe panic attacks at night, psychosis, derealization, I had the worst thoughts, I had no idea what was happening to me. I didn't sleep the whole night. At that time I didn't know it was from vitamin B12.\n\nIn the following days I felt better (I wasn't taking the vitamin at that time), until I took large doses of B12 again on December 17. The same thing happened again as on December 13.\n\nThe next few days were a real nightmare. I cried all the time, I couldn't do anything. I sat on the bed all day and didn't move. I had the worst thoughts, terrible depression and anxiety. Each minute felt like an hour. I felt that my life was over. I had a strong pressure in my head. I had panic attacks even before getting in the car. I was terrified of literally everything (darkness, tight spaces, loneliness, etc.)\n\nI didn't know what was happening to me or what I could do to feel better. I found out that high doses of B12 can cause methylation issues and that niacin/niacinamide can help. I started taking them and felt marginally better.\n\nThen I reduced my niacin dose and started feeling worse again. I feel a huge trauma inside me. Every time I feel a little better, I think it's going to get worse again.\n\nI don't even know how to describe the condition I'm in, but I'll try:\n\n* First, my brain has completely shut down. I have absolutely no thoughts. And when I do, they are highly negative.\n* My perception of time has changed. Time moves very, very slowly. Every day seems excruciatingly long.\n* Depression. Everything makes me extremely sad. Wherever I look, I feel deep despair. I can't watch TV, read books, talk to someone or anything, because I constantly feel such negative feelings that I want to explode (it's slightly better after I cry). I feel numb, dead inside.\n* I can't sleep (I fall asleep at 4am and for just 2-3 hours and it's been like that for a MONTH).\n* Horrible anxiety and occasional panic attacks (+ adrenaline rushes)\n* Complete anhedonia (I have no feelings and I haven't felt any positive feelings for a month), lack of interest in anything.\n* Depersonalization (everything seems artificial, I feel like I'm alone and somehow I see the world around me differently).\n* Very little desire to eat (or no appetite).\n* Dizziness, nausea, headaches, vision problems etc.\n* It's hard for me to do anything (cook, clean, etc.) because it constantly reminds me how terrible I feel.\n* I don't really feel exhausted. I feel overstimulated. I'm not sleepy.\n\nI don't know where to seek help anymore. I went to a psychiatrist and he said it was depression and anxiety, although I didn't even have time to tell him half of what I've written here.\n\nI definitely feel terribly traumatized after all of this. I keep saying that I need to forget everything that happened and that it will help me feel better.\n\nI'm afraid of many things now. I'm especially afraid of situations that made me feel worse. I had a few of those in the car. I felt absolute terror, an indescribable depression. It was as if all the negativity in the world had thrown itself at me. Every second I thought about jumping out of the car and ending it all. That traumatized me the most and that's what I'm most afraid of. I would do anything and give anything to forget about it completly.\n\nI just feel like my whole life has been destroyed, I feel like a zombie. I can't do much. I feel crazy. Unable to function normally. I live in my head all the time and I feel a huge fear that it will all come back again.\n\nI don't know if it's PTSD or something else, that's why I'm asking for advice. I'm grateful for any suggestions!",

    "selftext": "Hey, so I already made a post about this a bit earlier - how I realised one of my main traumas may be being stuck in a car with my dad and mom, him driving recklessly and telling us he will kill us and I felt like I couldn't breathe or even blink or show emotion or nothing, because I was worried that if he catches a glimpse of me, he will get upset even more and we will die. I remember the feeling of how I just wanted to be invisible....\n\nMany times I would tell people that my parents didn't really allow any emotions of mine and people think it is the classical \"SHUSH DON'T CRY\" in the shopping mall. But I guess it is a bit different than when you really fear for your life.\n\nI am going through an emotional period now and I realised I did breathe in a very shallow manner. Factually - I have always had the feeling like I don't want to breathe a lot or when I woke up, my limbs were just incredibly heavy and I felt like I could not move. I wanted to, but everything took so much effort. It was like I was trying to push through liquid sand.\n\nANYWAY back to now - I did notice the shallow breath and so I told myself I will try breathing deeper. I did. And the emotions came. And I knew it would happen, but I wondered why. Because so many times just taking a big breath feels SCARY. Then I tried to sway from side to side a bit. Again - fear, discomfort, and a huge wave of emotions. Just tears. And I guess I just realised it is because my body is afraid of moving because it signals \"YOU WILL DIE\". And this is.... Quite nice. To show up for myself and show myself it is in fact safe to move and nothing will harm me. It is uncomfortable and I almost feel nauseous.  \nAnd again yes, it is something I knew my entire life that may be because I am afraid. But now knowing the CLEAR example of a moment when I felt that way.... It helps.....\n\nThe thing is - do you think this is enough? Can I do this on my own to heal? Or do you think I should find a trauma therapist? I was in therapy and they did not grant me the trauma treatment because they said I have no trauma as I do not have ONE nightmare or a flashback. And I don't have money to just go to a private one, but maybe I can just talk to my GP.... I don't know.",

I truly am so scared that I eventually have no choice but to kill myself. I don't see any way this can get better and I don't see a way I can ever make new friends or meet a man and want the goals I want in my life to be fulfilled. I go back and forth every day with trying to kill myself . I have already had one unsccusssful attempt. I really want to know if it will get better because I honestly don't think that it will ever. I don't see a way out of this. I also don't see a way of making this better. I know everything below is my fault and I fucked up my life and now I can't live with myself. Please read the below story for context. I am mentally suffering and I am really afraid.\n\nI got engaged on my 29th bday (31F currently) to a man (now 32M) in 2022. I was so happy because I truly loved my partner. Rewind the times a bit - when I had first met him all was beautiful, his family loved me , his friends adored me. They were happy to see their family / friend with someone like me. Like every whirlwind romance, I had gone through some phases with him. I had gotten pregnant (and ultimately decided was not ready to be a mother) . When I brought up the pregnancy, I figured he loves me so much he will support me. To which he did support my decision but the first thing he brought up after me telling him I was pregnant was his ex girlfriend and her child which left me feeling extremely hurt , as really what does that have to do with you or myself? I got over it. I won't forget how we went away a week after and I was advised not to have sex. He told me I was exaggerating and against doctors orders I obliged to my partner.\n\nUnfortunately I wound up pregnant again, not from that incident and I was not ready to be a mom. I did what I had to do - again not that there wasn't support but it just felt like I had to get over it quickly. And that's very hard for someone who is going through those things. Fast forward few months after that, his sisters (who are around my age , one is the same age as me) would always get together and go out and do brunch with my partners brothers gf who was much younger than me but often felt she was the voice of reason.\n\nUnderstandably so my partner saw they were going out and stated why don't you invite her (meaning me), they huddled and contemplated and stated they didn't want a fourth person to join. I was also not offended by this as his sisters are heavy drinkers and I am not , also I don't want to be anyone's babysitter when they can't control themselves. Weeks go by, it is now August and it is the fathers birthday. I along with the others were invited for a bday dinner. I thought the night was going well until the sister who was my age showed up and the brother and his gf and they flat out ignored me the whole night. Anytime I tried to engage in conversation I was just shut down or ignored. This left me feeling completely horrible as I put my head down because it was evident by everyone at the table they were doing it on purpose.\n\nAfter that night I was completely ignored by two of his theee siblings - to this day I will never know why. I told my ex it's not right - that I can't do a relationship like this. He did stick up for me but it only got worse. We got engaged , his siblings did not show up or congratulate me on my engagement, leaving me to feel very horrible about what I could have possibly done when I was very friendly with them, bought food over anytime I came to visit , would try to befriend them or send memes or texts or try and plan things.\n\nI should preface this post by saying I am a calm person, passive, quiet. Him and his family are loud and obnoxious. After we got engaged my fianc√© told me they all hate me because they thought I was a gold digger. I had never in my life asked for my ex to pay a single thing of mine, I never asked him for money, I never even brought up money. I have a career in health, I went to college. Eventually when things got nasty between my ex and I he would remind me that his sister who is merely a receptionist was more successful than me. Which is not true btw lol.\n\nEventually things got worse. I went through his phone and found him talking terribly about me to a friend who actively cheats on his wife - talking about how he wants to \"bang\" this girl but doesn't want to get caught (we were engagd and went through so much) his friend encouraged. Him to cheat and said as long as I don't find out who cares. I found other messages, stating from his friends when are you gonna dump her already - you can do better - turning fights that he started on me - things about wedding planning he would say the opposite. We bought a house together.\n\nAt the same time of the closing my mom was going to treat me and pay for a small bridal shower- what girl doesn't want to feel like a queen? He told me if I did that he'd dump me and that I needed to only focus on the house. Eventually after the house I wanted to get a part time job as he always worked and rarely spent time with me. He told me I will make him look broke and forced me to quit my part time job. I wanted to purchase my own car - he told me nope forget that idea. I had to one day corner his sister after MONTHS of verbal abuse - there was an incident in the summer where she called me a moocher and told me I suck and he should leave me - eventually I confronted her, while I was dealing with my last relative being alive from cancer . She told me it's not you it's my brother , bullshit.\n\nI couldn't keep up with the family's itinerary as it was all about them and never about my life or the things I wanted to do with my fiancee. I couldn't even visit my mom at some point. He eventually forced me to almost take my life because of mental distress . There is so much more to this story, I am furthest from perfect but I tried. Does this sound normal to you?\n\nI should also mention while we were engaged he wanted to continuously hang out with his exes family although I stated it made me uncomfortable. She was also always I. The picture. His friends would often bring her up and I could never chime in on the convo bc it was awkward for me.\n\nFurthermore I want to mention the first time I ever met his best friend he asked me what kind of house I lived in and what kind of car I drove. Do you think he must've painted me in a bad light for all of this to happen? I'm so lost, ashamed, embarrassed. 32 and I feel like what is my life anymore. Sometimes I want to just give up. I hate myself.i Want to also add in - I did try and talk to the father and let him know how I felt when the sister was being awful to me. His words were , well what did you do to her?\n\nHis aunt also told me that she (his sibling) never wanted me around because she didn‚Äôt want to babysit me. His grandma , who has 8 granddaughters always told me oh hunny you need to let the man lead the way and you just follow‚Ä¶. Lady it‚Äôs 2025.\n\nNeedless to say now I am going to be 32, I am broke, no direction in life and literally nothing to show for my life besides my career. I just want to get my feet back on the ground - but I literally don't know how. This whole situation has consumed my mental health so badly. Please no judgement , apologies for the long post.\n\nI don't want to join an app. It is overwhelming enough to sit with these problems. I am still unraveling from all that has happened. I don't know what to do anymore",

I told my mom about the sunglasses and she told me the ones I was describing were NOT the ones he would wear. I needed answers so I took out my mom‚Äôs old scrapbook and there he was with me with sunglasses on the same ones I saw in the memory. That memory is sticking with me so hard. I‚Äôm not sure if anything bad happened with him however I can feel my child body on the sheets. I can feel the sheets underneath me and then I feel weird and gross. I haven‚Äôt thought about him or even remembered what he looked like until that EMDR session. I am afraid I am making up the memory. And that is where I need the advice. How do I know if I am making this all up? I feel like I am going crazy.  Thank you.",

    "title": "Childhood bullying messes you up",
    "selftext": "Before you read, know that I'm typing this more or less to just vent. If there's any advice you have share it.\n\nI am a 24M. In essence, I got bullied for pretty much my entire school life, age 7 till 17, so around 11 years. I classify it into sections, the earlier stuff, up till 6th grade, I can chalk up to kids being assholes. It's from grades 7th till 12th which I consider far worse, because the bullies got specific and definitely knew better. I will mention that my parents were pretty cool, so fortunately no abuse at home bar some cases where the \"disciplining\" went a bit far.\n\nI can't stress enough how pissed off I have been getting about this, and always have. Even though after school when I met new people they seemed to like me far more, een though college was pretty smooth and I made great friends, I still get so damn angry. Like, I would suddenly remember being kneed in the back for a \"laugh\", or held down, or put in a chokehold, or just being laughed at. The nicknames didn't stop, I was short and not very strong and it was like a damn crime. People like saying how \"height isn't everything\" and yet I still get teased, and when you have been trated near subhumanly for being short, it doesn't really count as fun.\n\nWhat's more is since being young I can remember that I developed serious fantasies of being hurt and then lashing out. When i was in 2nd grade, the fantasies were pretty much buried alive and turning into a dinosaur or  being so hurt that they would perform surgery on me and I'd turn into the terminator. As I have grown up, the fantasies have become far more serious. Only recently I have figured out why this happens, but stopping is really difficult.\n\nAny nightmares I have are always about school. I can have a nightmare about being eaten alive and not bat an eye, but being back in those damned hallways makes my skin crawl.\n\nI had hoped that the good experiences would eventually surpass the bad and I'd be okay, but it's only now that my parents' \"Get over it, forgive and forget\" advice sounds so hollow. How the fuck do I forget?? Feeling that powerless. . . The \"fight back\" thing didn't work because unlike movies the bullies wre indeed fiercer and stronger, they saw me fighting back as an insult and hit harder. I couldn't leave them alone, and eventually you get tired of the same thing over and over. You get tired of being told that you are overreacting. . . \n\nAnd what's worse is I still don't know if it is valid or not. The fantasizing especially makes it difficult, because I think \"am I just forcing myself to be sad?\" because I genuinely can't remember a lot of the grades. What if things weren't that bad and I'm concentrating the bad into it being years of shit? \n\nSo many of the experiences people have in high school I didn't have. When I graduated and everyone was taking picture with big friend groups and making memories I was alone. I only made actual friends after school, in college, and even then now that I have graduated, everyone is on their own path. While my friends have their own childhood friends, I have none. And now because I am an adult, I can't \"hold onto a grudge\", even though a lot of times I find myself wanting to bash their heads in. But that wouldn't happen. Back then I couldn't fight back because I was weak, now I can't because it's not \"mature\". Even when I was a kid, i could get hit, but the moment I did something \"naughty\", I'm far worse than the actual fucking bullies.\n\nWHat stings the most is, they don't care. I doubt they even remember. I have spent hours finding and stalking some of their socials, to see what they're up to. Honestly, it soldified that they have moved on. They have their own lives, while I have to deal with the shit that isn't my fault. Even \"live a good life\" sounds hollow sometimes. . . Good in respect to what? The bullshit is still there! Add to that the severe low self esteem, and you have a wonderful package. It's not exactly easy to just have self worth after being treated like you are deserving of every bad thing that happened. . . self worth is NOT infinite!\n\nTL;DR - Childhood bulying sucks and I fucking hate every single one of them.",

Divorce isn't simple or easy. I realized I was slipping away, moving beyond passively self-destructive into active. I found a psychiatrist after so many turned me down as too complex. Btw, my diagnoses are: MDD, AD, and PTSD from childhood. Throw in that I was diagnosed with ADD in 1975, it gets hard to find people.\n\nI found a clinic that's walking distance from my place and lo, and behold, after one session the doctor said she felt Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation offered the best path forward. Please know that it's a commitment. I went 36 straight work days from late November to early January. They say that consistency is critical in ensuring a good outcome, and I know the alternative was not good.\n\nIt has done a truly amazing job lifting my emotional floor from deep sobbing several times a day to now, where I'm realizing the toughest work might be moving forward without tears or the level of self-loathing I've spent a lifetime perfecting. \n\nI'm not cured by any means, but now that my floor has been lifted so much, I feel like my job is to learn how to be happy instead of avoiding pain and the mountain of emotions behind the pain. I also know that none of these therapies are consistent in application.\n\nFor me, TMS has been life-saving. Do I still have the thoughts? Yeah, but now that my emotional well has been filled in a bit more, I can find time to actually use the tools instead of using them and hoping today is a good day.\n\nThere are a lot of therapies. I've done CBT, EMDR, and now TMS. I'm told the relief will keep building over the next month or two; today I can say is maybe the best day I've had in years.",

    "title": "Dating with PTSD - my experience ",
    "selftext": "\nI was thinking that I wish there was a resource or something I could have read before I got back out there that could have prepared me for the psychological thriller that is dating for first time since the events that caused my PTSD.\n\nThis isn‚Äôt going to be that resource. It‚Äôs just one man‚Äôs journey, what‚Äôs worked, what hasn‚Äôt and what I‚Äôve learnt along the way. Most of this literally happens in my head. I really wish someone (a therapist, a psychiatrist, a psychotherapist, anyone) that my brain on PTSD would be unreliable.\n\nSo spoiler alert üö® in my experience all of the dating difficulties I face as someone living with PTSD stem from shame, wanting acceptance, fear of rejection, impaired thinking, seeking external ‚Äòlove‚Äô in place of self love and a complete inability to sit with my feelings. Funnily enough the feelings most difficult to sit usually follow positive experiences.\n\nA bit about me for context, I am in my early 40s, male and l spent most of my adult life in one relationship although remained childless. I have been out of that relationship for almost 2 years now (it was the PTSD symptoms that ended up putting a lot of pressure on the relationship). I haven‚Äôt worked since the events that caused my PTSD but have been financially stable through insurance related to how the PTSD occurred, this is also how I have accessed treatment.\n\nI was in a major city for the first period of dating and have spent the past 4 months dating regionally. I have done almost all my dating exclusively via dating apps (tindr, bumble, hinge).\n\nFor added context, the events that caused my PTSD occurred 6 years ago, I was diagnosed a year later but by that time I was heavily drug addicted and spent about 4 years in addiction so I couldn‚Äôt really get my symptoms treated until I was clean and sober. It‚Äôs been almost 2 years that I have had my PTSD symptoms treated. There might be some overlap with the comorbidity of PTSD and addiction and definitely feels like a lot of baggage to bring to a relationship.\n\nTreatments I have had include 3 three week inpatient stays at my countries leading trauma based psychiatric hospital, group therapy, weekly therapy (recently moved to fortnightly) and monthly psychiatrist (recently moved quarterly). Medication that I‚Äôm currently on is Mirtazapine (helps me sleep and is meant to be anti anxiety/depression) and clonadine (is a blood pressure medication but can be used for PTSD and has really helped in reducing my physical reaction and the intensity of flashbacks). I was on another medication called Prazosin which literally stopped nightmares. I only have nightmares now when I‚Äôm triggered or stressed. \n\nAdditionally I have ADHD and I use stimulant medication as prescribed.\n\nFor the past 2 years I have done a daily mindfulness program. This includes reading affirmations, praying, writing a gratitude list and meditation. Every evening I journal about my day and my feelings.\n\nI thought I was ready to get back out there way before I was. At 6 months clean and sober, 7 months out of a relationship and 4 years of PTSD I got on tindr. At this point I wasn‚Äôt comfortable discussing my diagnosis so from the drop there was no chance of me forming any sort of authentic connection. I got a decent amount of matches and was able to organize a handful of hookups. Regardless of how well (or badly) the hookups went they wreaked havoc on my mental health. \n\nLooking back at now it‚Äôs clear I was seeking was some sort of validation. This was probably my lowest point emotionally since becoming clean and sober. Although most of the women were cool and some of the experiences felt very validating in the moment it wasn‚Äôt the connection I actually yearned for. My PTSD symptoms got to an all time high around here, my nightmares got worse, flashbacks and anxiety were relentless and I became almost obsessed with getting more matches. Around this time my ex was hitting me up for hookups but even with a women I was very familiar with they were ultimately very detrimental to my mental health.\n\nThe validation I sought from the hookups was related to some internalized  insecurity in my masculinity. It was related to my inability to accept that I had PTSD and why I turned to drugs and alcohol. I couldn‚Äôt accept that I had been a victim as  my life experiences/influences had taught me that victims were women or men who couldn‚Äôt perform masculinity. Not being a victim had become part of my persona as a child as a way to deal with the neglect, abuse and abandonment I experienced from all my care givers. This translated into having terrible boundaries and taking in way to much as an adult, getting all my self esteem from status, achievements and eventually put me in the position to experience the events that left me with PTSD.\n\nI am really grateful that I had regular therapy at this point as well as mates I trusted. With support I was able to realize I needed to work on myself because no woman from tindr would be able to fix me. I also read a couple of books by Bell Hooks which helped me understand some of the shame I was feeling.\n\nAround 6 months after my initial foray into tindr I was getting ready for my 3rd inpatient stay at a psychiatric hospital which coincidentally coincided with my only experiences with (nearly) dating women I knew from real life. \n\nA woman I knew from recovery started calling me and wanted to meet up for coffee. We had a couple of chats over the phone but I didn‚Äôt make myself available to meet up with her and eventually ghosted her. At the time I just couldn‚Äôt think of a more constructive way to manage it. I do regret ghosting her as it was just a shitty way to manage it. I did run into her a few months later and apologized and told her my anxiety was just out of control which was essentially true. Looking back now tho, we had nothing in common and the only reason I even contemplated meeting with her was because I found her attractive and she seemed to like me. Again, it was validation seeking.\n\nOn either side of my psychiatric hospital stay I met women through mutual friends. Both showed interest and made the first step in contacting me and asking me on a date. I didn‚Äôt take either of them up on it and eventually ghosted. \n\nThere was a lot of fear, avoidance and lack of self love involved in this. Both of these women knew my story in terms of PTSD and addiction so I was able to convince myself they must be a bit emotionally unstable to want to date me. When the part of me that craves connection, acceptance and intimacy would push me to get back to them I would catastrophize with imagined scenarios about a disastrous relationship that ultimately destroys all my friendships. Seriously, this is where my PTSD mind took me when all that had happened was a nice woman asked me if I would like to go to an art gallery with her and another if I would like to meet for coffee. I have regret about being too afraid to go on these dates and I genuinely did want to at the time but my anxiety and impaired thinking just wouldn‚Äôt allow it. I wish I had understood how low stakes first dates are (intellectually I did but PTSD).\n\nThe reality is that the later 2 never dates was it only ever came up once with my friends. My mate asked me if the woman who asked me for coffee had rang me. I replied no (she texted) and we never spoke about her again and our friendship carried on. With hindsight being what it is I can see I was driven by avoidance, fear, unworthiness and being a bit disconnected from reality in general. \n\nFor the next few months I was on and off bumble. I would create an account (sometimes paid) and would spend hours crafting the perfect profile to attract the type of women I‚Äôm interested in which would be validated by the metric of likes, matches and messages received. I would then be overwhelmed with the imagined pressure to respond, maybe message with a couple of women then delete my profile only to run the same loop again in a few weeks. \n\nI only had 2 dates throughout this period and both were pretty disastrous. My loneliness and desperation for acceptance made everything seem incredibly high stakes. I was also incredibly insecure about how I had spent the past 5 years of my life and trying to show up and be authentic and genuine was impossible. Pre PTSD my career had been central to my identity and I carried a lot of shame about addiction and having PTSD.\n\nI spent the next couple of months off the apps as I was planning on leaving the city I was in and I was doing a lot of intensive therapy. I focused on friendships and getting out of my comfort zone in safe and playful ways.\n\nWhen I relocated 4 months ago I got on bumble straight away. There has been a pattern of when my life circumstances are uncertain and/or I‚Äôm dealing with triggering legal proceedings and/or dealing with adversarial insurance companies I hit the dating apps the hardest. This definitely hasn‚Äôt been healthy and is more evidence of my complete inability to sit with my feelings. \n\nIn the past 4 months I have had a total of 9 dates with 6 women the first 7 happening in late October and early November. In this period I have learnt the most about myself, modern dating, how my PTSD affects me and some much needed boundaries. \n\nI was pretty pessimistic about my chances of getting matches with my preferences after moving to the country but was pleasantly surprised.\n\nI had 4 first dates in quick succession. What I learnt was that was I cannot book multiple dates in the same week. If I have a bad first date on a Thursday afternoon and have another booked for Saturday morning, I‚Äôm gonna bring that same bad date energy to Saturday morning. I also felt somewhat disingenuous having multiple dates booked with different women. I realize it‚Äôs a reality of modern dating but for me to manage my PTSD symptoms I can only date one person at a time even if I‚Äôm talking to more on the apps.\n\nThe first woman I went on multiple dates with was really lovely. When I gave her a hug at the end of our first date I experienced butterflies in my stomach that I hadn‚Äôt experienced since the late 90s lol. It was unexpected, nice and hasn‚Äôt happened since.\n\nI still wasn‚Äôt comfortable to share about my PTSD diagnosis or my addiction history. I framed my PTSD symptoms as burn out from my career and said I didn‚Äôt drink because it made my anxiety worse. It turns out when I‚Äôm being inauthentic it makes my anxiety worse.\n\nWith hindsight I would have canceled our 2nd date as I was completely triggered for it. That day I had received a summery of facts from my barrister and seeing the incidents that caused my PTSD in dot points felt incredibly reductive. I actually talked about it on my date and described some of the events which was so much more triggering for me. In my experience trying to avoid the whole story just makes what I share worse and more triggered. The woman I was dating was a real trooper tho, she worked as a medical specialist and I feel like she used her professional skills to save the date.\n\nThe 3rd date we played board and card games at her house. I genuinely believe she was screening me to make sure it was anxiety that had me acting weird and not an intellectual disability. At this point I really wanted to be upfront about my history but was in avoidance mode. She initiated intimacy which I initially went with but then freaked out, apologized and left.\n\nI can‚Äôt say for sure what was going through my head in the moment. I had a realization on the way home that I want real intimacy where I feel known and I was the one withholding it. In effect my shame had me abandoning myself when all I wanted was acceptance but I wasn‚Äôt allowing my authentic self to be seen.\n\nI drafted a couple of texts explaining that it didn‚Äôt feel right as I had withheld information etc but never sent. A couple of days later she sent me a message wishing me the best but she wasn‚Äôt feeling the spark. I felt sad but also incredibly relieved. I was shocked with how relieved I was. \n\nThe following days I deleted my bumble account and ruminated on how amazing she was. Maybe she was the most amazing woman I would ever meet etc. I did some embarrassing stalkerish shit I would have never expected from me. I googled her, found her work and community organizations she was on the board of. One of the organizations was in a walking route I did with my dog‚Ä¶ I genuinely was already walking that way and continued to but I would day dream about running into her and explaining everything etc. \n\nI still feel embarrassed thinking about those dates and how I obsessed in days following. I am grateful for the experience as there were some really nice moments and I learnt I need to be authentic and vulnerable for a chance at the intimacy I want.\n\nI had a psychiatrist appointment in December and he told me he wanted me to go on one date a month. I honestly can‚Äôt remember his rational but it seemed achievable so on 4 Jan I went live with my hinge account. I purposely chose hinge as I have anxiety around sending likes and receiving none back. Because of this anxiety and a tendency to be pathological I kept notes on my activity.\n\nOn the 4th of Jan I sent 2 likes with messages and got responses to both of them. 1 woman was 2 hours away and the other 1 hour. There was a lot I like about the woman who was an hour away, she had done a lot of work on herself and healing from past relationships, she was curious, passionate and used language that demonstrated emotional intelligence. She was also conventionally stunning, I remember thinking that she was probably out of my league. \n\nI asked her for a date on the 7th and we met halfway on the 10th. We walked and stopped for coffee and ended up spending around 4 hours together. Over the course of the date I told that I had been diagnosed with PTSD and shortly after the incidents that caused my PTSD I went into addiction. She was much more interested in what I was feeling emotionally at those times than what had happened and what I was doing. It felt like a really natural way to discuss it. She discussed her passions and some of her trauma and her journey to heal it. \n\nShe initiated a hug when we rapped up and said a bunch of nice things and that she would like to do it again. I was on a real high.\n\nOn the drive home I got incredibly triggered. I started having flashbacks of trauma, the PTSD trauma as well as childhood trauma. I got into a really dark place thinking if anyone knew everything that had happened to me that would never be able to see me as a worthy partner, they would just pity me. I was in a real spiral. I wanted to call her and tell her all my darkest traumas‚Ä¶ at least I was able to see that thought for the madness it was.\n\nI arrived home and she had sent me a really lovely message saying how much she had enjoyed the date and she would like to do it again. In my triggered state I did way too much. I have a general rule of text that I only use 2 emojis ever which are üòéüòÇ because I feel self conscious otherwise. I was using all the emojis and just couldn‚Äôt contain myself.\n\nEmotionally I was going from elated thinking about the woman to complete despair thinking about how damaged I am. It was maybe the most triggered I had been in dating life since my hookups stage. \n\nWe had one more date but I couldn‚Äôt tell my communication was concerning her. I could feel she wasn‚Äôt that into it when we next met up and we didn‚Äôt spend long together. I can imagine her position as well we have 1 pretty good date but I drop a lot of heavy stuff then she has this addict with a mental health diagnosis acting completely over the top trying to move to a relationship. \n\nShe sent me a really long, kind and clear message explaining that where she was at in her personal journey of healing she had realized she couldn‚Äôt give herself to a relationship. I felt like I had definitely put to much pressure on her and I was honestly shocked with how easily I abandoned my curiosity to get to know her to just desperately wanting to be in a relationship with her. \n\nAgain, I had a real deep sense of relief when I got her ‚Äòit‚Äôs not you it‚Äôs me‚Äô message. I was disappointed but I had been really aware that I was doing too much. I had been unable to sit with a feeling whether positive or negative. There‚Äôs a concept called emotional sobriety where you are comfortable being present with all of your feelings without any one of them defining or controlling you.\n\nI‚Äôm aware of emotional sobriety.

I also said just was grateful to have met her and thanked her for the space she held as it had been very easy to show up and be authentic and vulnerable. She did hit me back with a message along the lines of ‚Äòaw that‚Äôs so sweet‚Äô so I deleted the message thread from my phone as I could feel the rumination coming on.\n\nI got triggered again when I saw she had unmatched me on hinge. I completely overhauled my profile to (what I imagine would) speak to a woman just like her. That was on the same day, I have since paused my account. No cyber stalking this time so some growth.\n\nI think dating and what it brings up for clearly shows me where I‚Äôm at. Unfortunately where I‚Äôm at is not where I want to be at. I want to be more healed. I have to accept where I‚Äôm at tho. Acceptance will get me closer to healing.\n\nI think I‚Äôm going to try my psychiatrists advice and go on a date a month. I need to be really aware that I am going to be triggered and that I will have to sit with my feelings if I am going to get the acceptance and intimacy I want. I  am worthy of love and self love is where it starts.\n\nI realize this might be more of a manic rant than a useful resource. The inspiration for this manic rant was the idea if I had just know that these emotions were possible or likely I could have perhaps sat with them and not had them control me at every turn. \n\nI‚Äôm too tried to edit this atm but gonna post regardless as probably won‚Äôt when I‚Äôm rested.\n\nFinal thought, if this comes across as red pill or disrespectful to woman I will delete as its definitely not the intention. \n",

But recovery is so damn exhausting, you probably know what i am talking about. its a hell of a rollercoaster ride and i just ask myself if i¬¥ll ever be able to live normally again. i dont see the light of the tunnel yet, or is there even a light, idk.\n\ni know, i am still in recovery and its probably normal but i feel so lost after this medical shitshow that happended to me. i dont know who i am, i dont know where to go in life. i was a young, innocent girl full of dreams, that are now all replaced by fear and doubt. i don¬¥t know this person i once was anymore. literally, all the ‚Äúbig goals‚Äù i had for the near future are now out of reach. in the past i had energy and i believed in me, nothing seamed impossible. now i am happy if i make it trough the day successfully and if i can cope with daily life.\n\ni also feel so out of touch with my peers. barely anybody my age has or had similar issues like me. i only wish i had ‚Äúnormal‚Äù problems that people experience in their early twenties. i also feel that i scare anyone my age if i share what happened to me and why i basically diappeared for almost a year. i simply cannot continue my life where i once left. i feel so alone and out of place. i have a lovibg and very supportive family that i am very grateful for and that helped me in those troublesome time, but yeah other than that i feel isolated and lonely.\n\nim soon finished with my education, which i dont see myself working in anymore. so far i got students support which soon ends, so i also have to find a job soon. i also have to move out from my dorm soon. So a lot of change is about to happen, since i rather crave stability atm but it is what it is. well, some day this thought of getting a cute and cheap little place for myself, and some part time job, would give me some motivation and energy to get my life back on track. on other days its seems to be completely pointless and surreal. well lets see.\n\ni know, it¬¥ll have to give myself more time to heal and i¬¥m still in the middle of recovery, but yeah, sometimes its just hard. i know it could be much worse and other people have it much worse, but yeah. like i said i dont know why i share this, maybe someone can resonate or tell me that there is some light at the end of the tunnel. \n\nthanks for reading, much love and hugs for my fellow fighters,\nxoxoxo\n<333\n",

The work was so difficult and the server assistant position wasn't worth it at all, as we were weren't treated kindly by most manager (minus one bless his heart). I had gotten put back to silverware rolling due to my complications with blackouts and seizures. A lot of which people barely believe me on, though he did, but I've finally got them under control now. People will say what they will, but I started to work with an older gentleman, Bob I believe his name is I'm can't remember much else. I was going through well extremely tough times with several people. So I wasn't always aware and very spacey. Though I wore a small pride bracelet and one day he asked me if there was a lot of us around here. I wasn't sure how he meant it at first so I didn't jump immediately to any conclusion. As time passed I kept talking to him as he never said anything rude and we worked well together, always chatting. Then he one day finally told me a bit about his life and told me he was an gay veteran, had a best friend he had lost years ago. So he had a temper and could get jumpy which I understood and always talked again with him. Just enjoying hearing his life story. Then one day the managers had made him be a server assistant. I couldn't believe it especially because I was only 20 at the time and it about broke me down. That day he got done, sat his tub down and had begun gagging from how over worked he was. I watched him run out to the trash cans and I quickly followed to see if he was okay, asked him and sat with him. Eventually he cooled down and told me he hasn't had anyone in over 20-30 years ask him if he was okay. I was the only, even that day no one went to check on him other then me. \nWhen I went through rough times he tried so hard to help get my job back, but I wasn't able to. I will never forget his effort for me, and I am glad I heard his story. I just know times are so hard now so I keep my best to try to be as kind as I can when I know it's for the right reason. The small things matter so much to some and this was one of those moments. And well if you got this far thank you!

    "selftext": "I can't help but automatically assume that that narrative I believed firmly in my head is true - that I'm innately inept and the lowest of the low. That I'm subhuman, and undeserving to even go outside and be in the presence of other people. That I deserve to die. That I deserve to rot in a room, but not even that. That just like when I was 13, I deserve death because of how badly of a person I was, for whatever reason.\n\nI guess my 13 year old self thought that because I couldn't attend school that I was a bad person. Something had to have been wrong with me because I wasn't like other kids - not like the other girls, specifically. I wished I had a boyfriend. Before I stopped going, the girls left me out and I had no friends. No boys looked at me or talked to me. One female was mean to me. She was new like me and got friends but I didn't. I almost attacked her. That was when I told myself I was bad and dangerous and that it was a breaking point. \n\nI had been suicidal and was having thoughts of fighting other females - so thoughts of harming others. That's when I knew I had an issue and took my own self out of school. I told my mom any and every promise and lie I could to get her to put me in home school, not knowing I had underlying ADHD.\n\nWhen I finally got homeschooled, I couldn't focus on work, and instead self taught unknowingly, but considered myself a giant failure who deserved death even more so.\n\nI turned to my mother for help, but she denied any problem. Sometimes she told me that I had an issue in myself. A secret moral conflict that I should ask God for forgiveness for. Sometimes I believed her, other times not. I equated this to her killing me. She was the only person who could do something about my situation. She denied my feelings. She told me they were my fault, validating only the narrative that I was an evil person who deserved death. In south Dakota, because we moved a lot, you had to have your parents consent to get treatment for mental health.\n\nAnd so I sat, for 5 years. Chronically suicidal, and crying only with emojis, having the internet digitally wipe my tears for me. I wasted away inside a trashed bedroom - neglected, wearing the same clothes, my hair in knots, and having not showered for a month, believing there was absolutely no hope and that my dreams were dead at age fucking 15.. 13.. 14, whatever.\n\nEven the slightest thing will tell me that I'm back there in the isolation as that person who is subhuman, worthless, deserves to die, so disgusting...\n\nI believed it for so long and that's why I get triggered so easily. It sends me back there again, too. It always feels like I'm there again, I've realized. I've realized it all started from this. This is a giant realization for me. A starting point for my future therapist. Thanks for whoever reads this.\n\n******\n\nAfter 18, well, I left to be on the streets because I couldn't stand being inside or my mom's house. Unfortunately the world was cold and ate me alive and I got addicted to Methamphetamine. I wanted to fit in so bad. I've been trying to quit for almost five years. I've been on it for three years straight. Recently been making a lot of progress recently with new medication on board ü•π. \n\nGot back from a narcotics anonymous meeting not too long ago. I've never felt more free in my life. That says a lot considering I'm addicted to intravenous methamphetamine. My dreams are alive and well today I can be whatever I want to be and do whatever I want with my life. Hope exists today.\n\nMy mom is much more healthy, as am I.

    "selftext": "I was raped as a teenager which has practically changed me overnight. Since then I've been fantasizing about raping, being raped, being humiliated, being tortured, etc. I feel absolutely disgusted every time I do this and it happens basically daily. I tried living in denial and with constant excuses and justifications of my thoughts. Outwardly I'm the complete opposite, when I'm not doing this I'm a creative, introspective, empathetic person who has talent and potential. But when I get aroused I turn into a monster.\n\nI've stopped living in denial because I met the most wonderful person I could ever meet. Shes a lot like me, sexual trauma and all, and I'm not sure if she has the same thing happen to her when she's aroused because we haven't opened up about it fully yet. But I do notice we both get incredibly kinky and rough while having sex and we have the tendency to feel immense guilt afterwards.\n\nThe thing that pains me is that when I feel myself get horny when she isn't here, the part of my brain gets switched on even harder than before I met her. Probably because I've been suppressing it. I'll spend an hour masturbating to the most disgusting and most degrading fantasies in which after I'll be so disgusted I feel like she should leave me.\n\nI'll get really graphic with my thoughts because I need this off my chest. Feel free to judge, you're only human. >!I often fantasize about getting anally raped to the point of internal and external bleeding. I fantasize about doing the same to others as well. Anything from drowning in cum, being raped by my family, having knifes plunged into my chest while being raped. Basically anything nonconsensual and violating!< \n\nI hate this so much and I'm afraid it'll cost me everything. But with arousal being a subconscious brain mechanism, and my association with sex being my first sexual experience (being raped by an older man), I feel like a slave to these urges. Sometimes you'll wake up horny before having the chance to even stop it. Sometimes you'll be caught totally off guard. Sometimes I'll see someone who looks like my abuser and I'll become a slave. It has only gotten worse. And I hate how the urge to go jerk off to rape fantasies is calling my name. I hate how it tells me that nobody has to find out. I hate how it tells me to do it in secret and lie to everyone. Because if I do that, I'll hear praise from my gf about how amazing of a person I am, and it genuinely breaks my heart knowing she has no idea I become a slave to the urge of another man raping me. If she told me she did the same thing, which based on the similarities of our personality is what i suspect; I'd feel incredibly relieved. But I'm scared to admit this in case she doesn't feel this way and I'll make her feel crushed.\n\nI'm going to emdr therapy soon, but what can I do in that time to help myself as much as I can? Does anybody have any success stories from something similar? I'd really appreciate hearing them",

    "selftext": "Okay so my dad has spent the last 30 years working super high stress jobs. My dad was on the fire department in the 90s. He tells me this story of a guy who lived in a camper. The camper caught fire and the guy melted to the floor since the floors in old campers had vinyl flooring. That was the first horrific story I‚Äôve heard. From there on his jobs and story‚Äôs have gotten worse. \n     He was in the army during all the Middle East stuff. He was a medic so he constantly saw horrific stuff. Such as people missing limbs/blown up, people getting shot, mass graves, unloading trucks full of body‚Äôs, smelling and dealing with full body burn victims. There‚Äôs tons of stuff I could list off but I assume you all get the point. \n     He then got out of the army and started working medical in a prison. All day it was people getting violently beat, stabbed, raped. He would show me pictures of cell floors COVERED in blood. \n     After working medical he then transitioned to custody, which is the actual prison guards. He has been assaulted, and has had to fight inmates. A job like that makes you stressed and alert all day for 10 hours a day. There‚Äôs not really a time where you can relax. \n    Anyways he just retired and I can tell he is really starting to lose it. He gets angry at any little thing. He seems to be stressed and nervous all day even when he‚Äôs just sitting around. He thinks everyone is out to get him and that everyone is a threat to him and his family. Any little thing can make him snap. He tried cooking breakfast, dropped the pan and lost it. Today the neighbors dog was barking and instead of talking to the neighbors he wanted to grab a BB gun and shoot the neighbors window. I don‚Äôt see how anyone would think that‚Äôs a good idea. It wasn‚Äôt ever like this. He has always been a super sweet person and he‚Äôs a great dad and husband. I think since he just retired he doesn‚Äôt know how to calm down and has to make every situation stressful because that‚Äôs all that he‚Äôs used to \n     He‚Äôs against therapy and believing in mental health. He thinks that people who see therapist are weak and don‚Äôt know what real problems are. He has real problems but won‚Äôt admit it. \n     How do I get him to see a therapist? ",

    "title": "Discovered my ex was a sadist, I made her lose her job by exposing her to her boss. I can't shake the pain off.",
    "selftext": "(This is a hardcore story of mine, be kind, don't judge me)\n\nI met her in February 2024. The day after I turned 30 years old.\n\nShe was 27yo asking for political signatures as her main job in the streets of the city. She was sweet and caring, dark humour and we vibed.\n\n2 weeks into getting to know each other I spent time with her. She told me she had an abusive father who was completely ostracized from her family. She also told me her previous exe's were abusive. She told me they isolated her, raped her, made threats of suicide if she didn't come back. She told me about her exe's wanting to kill her in the streets of her home town. Told me she had to carry scissors in her jacket.\n\nShe told me she was epileptic since age 13 because of a drowning incident. She told me her best friend (a guy) committed suicide in 2020 and she is now carrying a medallion in his memory. (I saw the guy's picture inside the medallion and also checked his social media accounts).\n\nAs the first two weeks passed I felt like I met an angel, the person I had waited for my whole life. Traumatic childhood just like me, lost my father and I also have an incurable medical condition...a match made in heaven.\n\nShe told me she liked domination, I thought she seemed very confident about her sexuality. Turns out she was outright telling me what was going to happen to me in the coming months in an inverted subtle way...\n\nShe told me she wasn't going to be here for long, claimed she needed to go back to her home town to get a new job there. I was disappointed of course and gave her confirmation that I was now \"binded\" to her. (I didn't know she was manipulative at the time of course...)\n\nA day after that statement she made, she wanted me to meet her male friend. I agreed since I'm not possessive and don't get overly jealous. As I shake the guy's hand in the pub we sit down and my \"girlfriend\" goes to the bar to order beers. I politely asked the guy friend what was my the nature of their relationship. The guy tells me \"it's for pleasure\" And boom, just like that she tried to \"use\" me or coerce me into having an unconsenting threesome. By using triangulation, cunning two people against each other, male competitiveness and so on she loved to see me anguish that night.\n\nI know I should have walked away and never talk to her again. But boredom of my life, might as well get to experience something and perhaps help this epileptic girl? Why would she spend her time to get to know me for two weeks straight?\n\nI stayed in the relationship for a total of four months.\n\nShe was a parasite, asking for money, favors, meals. She had two cellphones. She told me about cults late at night while I smoked weed and she didn't. I had been off from weed prior of meeting her. She reintroduced weed into my life because she claimed it would help her prepare for sodomy (something I didn't ask to do in the first place...)\n\nLate at night, while I thought she was being thoughtful and while I was on weed, I heard phrases like:\n\"tell me one good thing about your mother or father\"\n\n\"Your father who left you when you were four, do you think he loved you for abandoning you? Why are you still keeping in touch with him?\"\n\n\"I really feel sorry for you, it looks like your family didn't give you enough love\"\n\nFellow readers, if you had to ask these questions to your partner directly, what would be the intention or purpose?\n\nIsolation in progress, while she took advantage of my trust. I gradually stopped talking to my friends and family. I was also too damn busy fixing her curriculum and dealing with her horrible job and medical condition.\n\nOne day I had an eye infection and went to the ophthalmologist, there my eyes were spread open and held firmly tools. She was in the room because she wanted come along and support. When we got home she told me about a movie we should watch. She said it had a \"scene\" in it that I would like very much.\n\nTurned out the \"scene\" is a woman who goes to the ophthalmologist and gets her eyes openned by claws (very similar to what I experienced 2hrs before..) The lady gets her eyes burned by laser as she is unable to close her eyes. She dies horribly falling from the building, from the shock of impact, her burned eye rolled out on the road and ends up smashed by a car passing by. I paused the movie and saw that she was smiling. A smirk of satisfaction. I asked her: \"why are you showing me this?\" Her answer: \"I don't know üòã\"\n\nScene: https://youtu.be/oJGlE1S99tw?si=POXCuPjthk1okcfS\n\nShe burned a dog who was resting between chairs on a terrace. She spilled the coffee on top of the dog as she was passing over him. I didn't know it was sadism at the time and the dog owners believed it was an accident. I know she saw the dog there and greeted him as she was about to order coffee. She saw that dog but yet was able to fucking trip over him and spilling hot coffee.\n\nShe flirted very subtly with men while humiliating me when I wanted to get physically romantic with her in public.\n\nShe introduced me her boss very early on into the relationship. I did tell her that it's not a very ethical thing to do but she didn't seem to care. So one day she asked me to go get her paycheck directly from the boss hands and I did it. Her boss was a witness of my devotion for her throughout the 4 months of this insane relationship.\n\nShe had a family of two sisters and a mother. The family was calling her frequently to see how she was doing... Or maybe to check if I was still breathing lol. I thought if the family is still supporting her then it's not hopeless.\n\nBut then one day she went too far at a bar and started to flirt way too much with a guy. She made sure her sentence mentioned her \"ass\" so that all the drunk guys would turn their heads. As one of them whispered something in her ear I knew the relationship was no longer sustainable.\n\nI called her sister the day of the breakup and explained the behaviors I saw and the things that she does. The sister called me insane and mental. She hung up on me. We broke up, she stalked me for a month by gravitating close to my apartment. She made sure id see her flirting with other men as I'd walk by.\n\nThen I typed \"narcissist\" on Google out of frustration. (She called her exe's narcissists) And to my shocking discovery I notice that narcissism is filled with images of a white \"mask\". A mask that I see is included my partners profile picture. All her social media has a picture of her with a mime in a costume wearing a white mask. She stands next to him making the heart shape with her hands.\n\nTurns out my whole relationship is based on a strategy, lies, deceit, profit, emtional rape, psychological torture and sadism.\n\nHer very first words when I met her \"I checked your Instagram to make sure you weren't a psychopath\"\n\nI realized that the medallion she was carrying was someone that she had pushed to suicide. I realized that all she told about her exe's and what they did to her had happened to me. I realized that she was a sadist and that she used love as a weapon to make me fall hard so she could better abuse me.\n\nUpon realizing that my girlfriend is a nymphomaniac sadist who could potentially give me HIV I panicked. The humiliation was so strong. I felt like jumping out of my apartment just to end the suffering.\n\nI spent a full week not sleeping nor eating. I left messages late at night to her boss who was probably witnessing weird shit from her as well. I knew it was immoral to do such a thing. I ended up calling the boss as I had been driven by ambulance to the hospital for suicide attempt.\n\nI told him everything on the phone. He told me I was the confirmation he needed. He explained to me that she was tyrannizing the whole team, humiliating them, belittling them, flirting with men, lying to create chaos between coworkers, making highly inappropriate sexual suggestions or innuendos. He told me she had sex with a coworker of mine.\n\nShe filed a complaint against me for calumny and death threats as I mentioned to her boss my will to kill her. No wonder all her exe's wanted to kill her.\n\nHer boss fired her about two weeks after we broke up. She was still stalking me at the time. Our last conversation at a caf√© near my apartment, she slapped my face and and threw water in my face in public as I was asking for an explanation for her mad ways...\n\nShe blocked me and disappeared never to be seen again. Her boss saw her a month later dragging a new insecure guy, likely her next victim, vulnerable people.\n\nObviously she just jumps from men to men while abusing them altogether.\n\nMoral of the story I dated an antisocial personality disorder individual. Her psychopathy was so high on the spectrum that she needed domination and sadism in order to feel good about herself. She cannot attach to any living thing. She will hurt anyone, even her family or the family's dogs.\n\nIt is extremely scary to come across such an individual. It made me grow up but I feel like I've been given a glimpse of what should never be seen. Her torture movies, the lip sewing while the lady screamed. The sadistic pleasure of seeing someone in pain. The proudness of having killed someone and wearing a medallion as a trophy. Knowing that she's a dead man's trap.\n\nShe doesn't feel remorse for what she did to me or other living beings before me. I do feel remorse for contributing into her getting fired. I feel like I had no choice, I believe she wanted to deceive me and hurt me so fucking hard I'd kill myself. Like in ww1 germans used gas, so what did the french end up doing? retaliating with gas. I became like that but I had no choice. She wanted confrontation because it makes her feel good. A very sad wasted life.",

    "selftext": "Throw away account for this as my friend knows my usual username\n\n**Trigger Warning this post mentions not graphically Domestic Violence, Suicide and Self Harm**\n\nLooking how I can help said friend. For context we‚Äôre in the UK but this is about helping her accept so she can move forwards so happy to hear from anyone all over the world.¬†\n\nMy friend (35/F) is the sweetest, loveliest kindest woman you will ever meet. She‚Äôd literally give you her last ¬£ if she saw you struggling. She buys food for the homeless, she gives to food banks and other charities, she has previously volunteered in schools and nurseries reading with children and helping with trips. She is quite literally perfect if you meet her day to day.\n\nBut she has a massive flaw. She refuses to accept her Mental Health and it‚Äôs affecting her life badly.  \nShe has two children (Both female, aged 9 and 7) who are currently in Foster Care due to her lack of insight into her MH. They have been there for coming up to 18 months now, she wants them home but will not give any acceptance to her MH and until she does I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôll get her children home. The children where generally well cared for, but where a little bit babied and my friend struggled with their behaviour in the 6 months before they were taken off her; nothing hugely bad but she struggled to say no, there where times friend would be very disorganised and the children would go to school or groups without things they needed like a jumper or their PE kit (not massive issues but show her not coping), she relied far too much on takeaways when stressed, would stop washing their clothes and just buy new if the washing piled up etc. but it was starting to affect the childrens behaviour in school so it was decided by Social Services, School and my friend that the children should go into foster care while she got herself sorted out ‚Äì she sees them 5 times a week including once over the weekends and is allowed to take them out unsupervised. She has no family as they all cut her off when she left her husband as they said she messed up her marriage and must face the consequences alone.\n\nShe has experienced Domestic Abuse and most likely violence from her childrens father but she refuses to accept it, says it didn‚Äôt happen and on the rare occasion she says she deserved it and made him do those things to her; she has a scar on her wrist I strongly suspect her gave to her, and another similar one on her shoulder ‚Äì I met her after they split. There is a court order preventing him having any contact with any of them (hence the FC instead of them going to him), which makes her being isolated from family all the worse ‚Äì her family don‚Äôt believe she was abused because she doesn‚Äôt act like she was according to them, she‚Äôs very quiet, private about her life and just wants to keep her head down and get on with it.\n\nShe‚Äôs had help to get on top of things in the home, but feels very self-conscious about it so won‚Äôt have things like a routine on her walls/doors to help her with organisation which SS say show no insight into moving forward and improving.\n\nShe‚Äôs had some courses via Women‚Äôs Aid (Domestic Violence Charity in the UK) but found it unhelpful as she said she didn‚Äôt fit in with the women there as they‚Äôve all experience real Domestic Violence unlike her. She didn‚Äôt feel any sort of connection with any of the women who all seemed to make friends and she was glad when both courses where over.\n\nHer CPN (think it‚Äôs Community Psychiatric Nurse ‚Äì she‚Äôs with the local MH team but not part of her GP surgery or anything) organised some therapy both 1-1 and group for trauma victims but she found neither helpful. Says the therapist just wanted to talk about her marriage and when friend told her that they split because others believe he was violent the therapist kept asking her for examples of the violence and she couldn‚Äôt think of any then she didn‚Äôt want to talk to the therapist so just did each session without contributing anything personal so it was very much a textbook type thing where the therapist tried to get her to do breathing exercises and think about her feelings which she says made her feel stupid and like a naughty school girl. She felt out of place in the group setting again because she felt she hadn‚Äôt experience trauma or had a reason to say she did so she sat there in silence ‚Äì when she was given an excuse to not go friend didn‚Äôt go which is apparently unusual as most people want to go back after a few sessions in the group setting.\n\nHer CPN has that friend doesn‚Äôt seem to know why she has to see the CPN ¬†and is in total denial about her MH and how bad it is. According to Social Services reports she‚Äôs diagnosed with PTSD, Social Anxiety Disorder and Panic Disorder. However she is low risk for self-harm and suicide as did the therapist for the 1-1. She is also low risk of harming others, probably because she‚Äôs so indenial about her conditions.\n\nSocial Services have said she needs to have some insight into her MH to be able to fully sort herself out because if she doesn‚Äôt then the risk is too great of harm coming to her children so they cannot return to her.\n\nAs I said she‚Äôs the loveliest, sweetest, kindest woman you‚Äôll ever meet but completely shut off when it comes to herself. She blames herself for every little thing and Social Services have noted this too, so when her elder daughter fell at school and hurt her knee she blamed herself saying she‚Äôd not warned her daughter to be careful at school that morning, similarly her younger daughter has a perfectly normal accident while at a playground where she fell and broke her arm, friend took appropriate action by taking her to the hospital where it was put in a cast which her daughter loved but friend blames herself saying she should have been standing under her daughter as she climbed the steps on the slide (she fell off the side and snapped her wrist when trying to stop herself falling ‚Äì perfectly normal childhood accident that any child could have even the hospital said this!).\n\nSo how can I help her? I love her, she‚Äôs like a sister to me and her children are my nieces but I know she needs to have this insight. I want her children to be back at home with her, where they want to be, but I know she needs to accept her MH is poor and try to improve it to be able to. Anything I can suggest? Even if that is to the CPN or Social Services.",

This couldn't be any further from the truth, I even have him 80% of the time and treat him amazingly!\n\nI recently got remarried and it's been very hard for my son, but it's especially hard because my ex is working even harder to keep my son's PTSD of me leaving the family alive and healthy, despite our son going to therapy now to work through it. \n\nWhenever my son is upset, he goes into a rage and panic attack about how I'm leaving him, how I no longer love him and want nothing to do with him, etc. One time I made the mistake of bringing up a little trip I went on to a friend's birthday out of state during his time with his dad. He had another panic attack about how I've left him and that it's proof I never want to be with him and that he should just stay with Dad forever.

I very specifically schedule my work to be while he's with his dad whenever possible so I only have to work a couple days when my son is with me to be mindful about his PTSD.\n\nI can't handle this anymore, I'm at my wits end. I've done everything I possibly can to cater to my son and his PTSD that ‚ÄùI'm leaving/have left the family.\" I've proven my son's entire life that I'm not leaving him and it feels like the situation isn't improving at all. What else can I do?? I need tools and advice on how to cope with this, please!",

    "selftext": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd it lasted for two hours, and I probably lost all of my hair during. No, I wasn't screaming nor crying nor shouting. But I was, very visibly, in massive, huge distress.\n\n\n\n\n\nI haven't really slept in several days due to nightmares.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi, community. I might possibly (hopefully not but) post here a lot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI was diagnosed officially a while ago. But I've known I had PTSD quite likely since the age of 15.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI was, and for most of my life so far, subjected to severe sexual abuse, and abuse in all forms imaginable, and then gaslit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI was also surrounded by stand-by-ers, liars, and by people who protected the abusers all in different ways and thereby ensured that the abuse would continue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI said in all forms: sexually, verbally, mentally, psychologically, materially, financially, exploited for gain, socially and physically and beyond more.\n\n\n\nThese abusers also kidnapped me or had me kidnapped. Multiple times.\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm more than brave enough to post this now though I'm not sure exactly why. Perhaps knowing that, as protectively selfish as I can sometimes be, someone out there is suffering as much as I am.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sheer hysteria, as I called it, and extreme distress was seemingly triggered not only by the nightmares and the subsequent-physical-body-sleep-refusal, but the physical breaking of a few of my belongings today.\n\n\n\n\n\nA few of my things got broken. And I am, even now, too exhausted to go out and find replacements for them. I'm too dead to cry, too sleepless to go outside, too numb to function, all at once.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut let me say: the day needed to come where I write all this down, and I didn't know it would be now and it would be here.\n\n\n\n\n\nThousands of us suffer, and at the same time we feel alone, and at the same time we often want to be alone. I know I certainly value my solitude. And often, my independence I rank higher than all else.\n\n\n\n\nI am so lucky to have a supply of clean water and a bottle to put it in. I drank some of it and took one long, deep breath. I still feel awful. Awful and numb at once.\n\n\n\n\n\nI cope by writing songs and poems and long stories which capture almost the exact things I was subjected to while I was a literally tortured child.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlmost all my writing is PTSD-based, PTSD-fueled, nightmare-inspired and memory-crafted. I tend to post my songs online, and on a \"scheduled\" automatic basis.\n\n\n\n\n\nI normally don't fall apart while *in the middle of* writing songs but today I absolutely did. I still mostly blame the physical-self-protection-hypervigilance-survival-refusal to sleep.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI still have a few self-harm tendencies. But by the grace of God (please replace these concepts with those of your choice to fit what you, the reader, believe) and karma and the universe, my tendencies towards self-harm are genuinely so much less than what they were ten years ago; when I was 17.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI turn 28 later on this year. I have accomplished so much; at times, it feels like so little. It feels that way sometimes. It does, and when it does, I hate it. I have a path in front of me. Just like we all do. And we all have to walk it.\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm staring at a screen now to write a message like this but today is when these words had to come out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm a writer, so love or hate me for a long post if you must. All that matters is that I did write it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake the hurt a tool to turn you into the best version of you and not into a monster, because the world already has too many of those.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's gonna keep hurting but we made it this far for a reason.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep on fighting every single day, my fellow survivors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDanny\n\n\n\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntl;dr(?)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere really isn't one",

    "selftext": "I'll start by apologizing if I won't be able to express myself 110%, but I'm Italian and not exactly familiar with more specific technical terminology. \n\nI have been treated for about 7 years with cognitive behavioral therapy and EMDR, I have a partial diagnosis of borderline disorder resulting in depression and a history mainly based on a sense of guilt and insecurity, linked to parental figures (and para-parental ones, like my uncle /brother, having only 15 years difference, who completely replaced the father figure during my father's shortcomings). \n\nMy mother is the most important person in my life, in childhood she was violent to the extent that a mother from the 90s is who responds to crying with a slap, also a victim of a family that raised her in this way, it led me to become her mental caregiver in giving her \"as little trouble as possible\". She worked her whole life to give me everything and redeem herself from her father. I always saw my family as me and her even when my father was still with us.\n\nMy father is a gambling addict with a clear narcissistic gray area resulting from a possible trauma that made him dramatically childish and self-centred and consequently take on his responsibilities with anyone (after the separation with my mother he always used me as an implicit messenger of his being a good person, making nice, fatherly gestures towards me just to prove something to my mother). He never tried to teach me anything, putting everything on my mother‚Äôs shoulders, even if she was working night and day on developing her company and have enough money for all of us.\n\nMy uncle, when I was growing up, due to the loss of his mother at a very young age (21 years old) and the consequent transfert of the maternal figure in my mother, was a constant and very important figure in my life who built 90% of my personality, stimulating my actual passions and ambitions. even if he was ‚Äúmy hero‚Äù, very often I took part to conversations without filters and naivety (as if I was an adult as him) when it comes to discussions about sex that, in particular during puberty fueled this mythologizing of the sex world.\n\nIn 2020, during a psychotherapy session I innocently \"confess\" to my therapist that up until the age of 15 (when I firmly began to oppose it), my father used to kiss me on the mouth (passionate kisses, with his tongue ) and \"tenderly\" stuck his tongue in my ear, believing these were normal things fathers do, no?\n\nMy therapist, although it wasn't the first time I talked about this dynamic, on that occasion made me understand about a potential dynamic of \"physical\" abuse from my father, as well as \"psychological\" on the part of the other two key figures of my life that made me constantly self doubting about reality and live without a fair point of reference in my life. \n\nI rack my brain for two years, despairing because I can‚Äôt remember or recall any actual memory of an actual abuse but only detached pieces (burnings in my genitals, games with a profoundly sexual nature during my 5-6 years old) and I also start to tell myself that maybe this never happened and I'm exaggerating. \n\nIn all of this I experience a distorted sexuality made of extreme voracity of hard experience and desire for humiliation, swingers clubs and very dangerous encounters that my therapist reads as \"passive suicides\" combined with alcohol and substance abuse (of course).\n\nHowever, I managed to move forward very well in my career and in my life, quitting alchool and drugs to resolve myself just enough and meet the man who would later become my husband, the man of my life and perfect teammate despite his very deep traumas and with whom we are still doing a psychological journey as a couple to resolve ourselves together before thinking of having children (as our parents perhaps should have done before having us, but those were different times). \n\nThe problem is the following: we cannot have a peaceful sexuality. \nWe are very strong in everything: work, home, family, planning. \nWe love each other infinitely, there is great intimacy and tenderness but we are no longer able to have sexual relations with each other. He knows that I like a more aggressive type of sexuality, I know that he seeks a tenderness in sex that has never been part of the \"things I like\" in sex. \n\nI'm starting to think that it depends a lot on that missing piece of my story, also because after an enormous sexual voracity that has always characterized my life to the point of making me more than precocious in my experiences, since I reached certain awareness with therapy I‚Äôm not attracted to sex anymore, except when I happen to drink and dissociate (increasingly rarely). \n\nDo you have similar studies/advice/therapy/experiences to share? \nI'd like to feel less alone in this :) \n\nThank you",

The other two games were just me quietly sobbing at my table in the corner while I ate my fries...I feel like such a fucking loser right now, I'm almost 28 and I'm breaking down over bowling of all things.\n\nBut I don't even care about winning that much and it wasn't even about that, I just REALLY hate losing (or at least losing in a way that makes me look like I can't do anything right...) \n\nNo matter how hard I try to be social, make friends, push myself out of my comfort zone and heal/grow as a person, shit like this always sets me 100 steps back mentally and sends me spiraling as soon as I get home.\n\nEvery time I feel like I'm finally starting to get better, something always has to immediately knock me down all the way back to square one, to remind me that this is where I REALLY belong...I probably wouldn't even be able to rot in the ground without fucking something up...\n\nEvery time I try to let go of my old/unhealthy coping mechanisms (smoking weed/eating snacks and junk food cause I can't be bothered to make an actual meal when I'm like this) I have a day like this and I cave in as soon as I get home to lock myself in my room and binge the rest of the night.\n\nI feel so hopeless and selfish...I know I'm not the only person in the world with problems and that there's plenty of people that have it way worse than me, it's just really hard for me not to feel singled out sometimes when everyone else around me acts so happy and oblivious.\n\nFitting in is effortless for them while I always end up making myself look like an angry, crying, unstable mess that no one should ever be around.\n\nI have zero talent or passion for anything, I peaked in elementary school and those days are never coming back. I'll never get to be the \"gifted\" art kid that everyone loves and praises ever again.....I hate art now and I stopped practicing years ago.\n\nIf I'm still in this exact same spot by my 30th birthday then I might as well just make that one my last...",

Stress tolerance is going up again...\nThis was a lot of work and stress I put me in to keep me going back to \"normal\". A lot of times when sth went south I was trying, I kept on standing up and do it again, most of the time this is my way to those success I think. \n\nBut thos spark is bothering more, sometimes I got a glimpse of it back.\nBut sometimes it feels like this spark is never coming back.\nI've been to a lot of concerts,plays etc.. but most of this stuff I've been doing on my own, because I'm too affraid that sth happens then I'm not feeling well and then I'm not that person that they used to know, I also won't crash the good mood and let everybody down. But mostly I'am afraid of myself, that's not the selfimage I want and I had from me.\n \nI hate that I'am afraid of going out with friends and then been stuck in the negative.

    "selftext": "Okay so there's a lot to unpack, there is also a lot of SA in my past and my dad was very verbally abusive as well, but I want to maybe get your opinion on other kinds of situations.\n\nMy dad was very abusive even at home, many times I was just so scared and my mom was holding the door so he didn't get to me. I was always totally terrified not knowing what is gonna happen in the next few seconds. Will she manage to hold the door? What if not? What will happen then? Will I die? He would eventually calm down but then he would get another wave of rage and it would rinse and repeat - so I never knew when it is really over. I think that is why I don't feel safe till I really know for sure the issue is in the past. I also totally hate hearing people walking or talking behind the door of my apartment etc :))\n\nI also remember him beating my mom. And he got to me a few times too. I remember once we were out skiing, I was having a snow glider. I was little. And I accidentally let the strap slip from my hands and the glider.... glided away lol. He got upset that I am ungrateful and the only thing I remember afterwards is that I was flying in the air after the glide lmao.\n\nAnother thing is that once my mom was not home and he called me for a lunch. I did not hear because I was playing my guitar. Then he came in raging, threw the guitar away and I just remember being on the floor. I don't know what he was doing but I knew I was curled up and taking some hits. You know when you are kinda disconnected so you don't feel as much, you just feel the slow warmth from the punches spilling over your body. Ringing in ears from the hits and so. Then he started walking away. And I wanted to get up. But that triggered him. So I just knew I have to keep being still so it doesn't repeat itself. There is quite a sad thing I realised recently - what I felt because he was usually calling me pretty bad names, and then praised me in front of people, because he had the need to look perfect for others. While I was just lying there not moving, I felt shame. Shame that I must look so ugly lying like that on the floor. That my limbs are positioned in an ugly way. That I am just puffy and red and gross and pathetic because I am crying. I wanted to at least maybe wipe my snot, so I don't look so bad in front of him. But I could not move. Because then he would start it again. I was feeling shame that I am not good enough for him after he abused me. And that I am not a pretty victim...\n\nAnyway now to the most recent thing. It was happening quite often that he would get angry while driving. I kinda remember mainly one incident. Him driving. My mom next to him. Me on the back seat. He got upset and started shouting and speeding. And telling us how we are c\\*nts and wh\\*res and bi\\*ches and he is gonna kill us all. I just remember being so scared. Totally frozen on the back seat because I was afraid that if he catches my face in the back mirror, he will not like it and it will anger him even more and he will crash the car. I did not even want to breathe or blink. I was really afraid that I will move one inch and he will steer the car. At the same time I felt like I was on fire. Again, I know it was happening quite frequently, but one of them I remember quite clearly.\n\nAnd situations like this kept happening on a regular basis, I would have more problems figuring out when there were actually ok moments. Lmao some people say that children look towards their parents as they are gods. I never related to it. Because I guess if you pray to god, you pray for love and happiness and good stuff. I felt like I was praying for my life. So if he was a god for me, then it must have been a god of death.\n\nAnd I think related to this... I also realised why I have issues \"leaving\" conflict? I know rationally that when I get upset or when I am triggered by something, I should leave and take it easy and navigate situation when I am calmer. But there comes point when I cannot even think and the thought that I have the option to leave is nowhere to be found. I also really HATE public transport. I always sit in the front seat. Or by the door. If I am stuck somewhere by the window and it is full of people, I get almost panicky because I feel like I cannot escape and I am trapped. It happens on buses and trains too. I hate that I cannot feel fresh air - one thing I really do not appreciate about modern trains lol. I do get into cars but when people start driving a little bit too fast for me (which doesn't have to be fast at all), I am getting uncomfortable. \n\nI was assesed for PTSD but they told me I do not have it because I do not have ONE flashback or a nightmare to which I am returning to. I mean but the topics are quite similar. It is always being trapped, not having a say in the situation and having my autonomy taken away. My nightmares would usually involve me being - again, trapped. In my childhood house. Many times I would be running away and jumping from the windows. Hoping to catch the bus and escape without him knowing where I am. Or knocking on the doors of neighbours and feeling hopeless because it takes them so long and he will get me. \n\nI think all I am asking is to know if I am unreasonable for thinking they may have underestimated it?",

I can‚Äôt sleep correctly, I‚Äôve had stomach aches just from thinking too hard, and I feel so lonely all of the time but when I‚Äôm around others I‚Äôm scared of them leaving me or getting bored/tired of me. Yes, it was a frequent thing in two previous relationships both friend wise and romantic wise. Even now I‚Äôm up at night nauseated and in pain because of the anxiety. I think I just need support to know I‚Äôm not crazy and that the things that happened to me were real and I do start therapy on Monday, but I just feel so.. Out of touch. Did it happen? Am I just crazy? I have been diagnosed with PTSD also before this too.. Idk. I feel like I just need some advice. :(",

    "title": "Crawling back to Calm\ndifferences in meditation for people living with PTSD\n",
    "selftext": "\\-insight from 5 years of focused PTSD recovery after witnessing my fianc√©e take his own life/ years of abuse\n\n\\-this isn't a guide by any means, simply my own experience trying to live with PTSD\n\n\n\nI felt prompted to write this out after seeing a post about why trauma survivors shouldn't meditate by typical definitions. The post resonated with me on an incredibly deep level and took me back to right after my big trauma event, and the healing path I went on. Like many others facing suffering I was advised to meditate on what I was struggling with, a kind suggestion that had viscerally opposite effects on me at that stage in my healing. I felt frustrated and convinced that I was simply just doing it wrong, as I had seen firsthand the wonderful results of long-term meditation. Still I persisted, and began listening to guided meditations from Plum Village.¬†\n\nIt was not until I heard one monk state how it is not necessary to remain still, to allow natural twitches and physical response to flow through you during meditation, that my efforts started to feel like it was actually doing something different within me. I let go of the notion that my meditation had to be in the sitting position, as the little twitches I was told to not ignore would often bring me to very physically expressive motions, and it was in those moments of movement that I felt the ease so many others described getting from traditional sitting meditation. The practice of aimlessness became my go-to for grounding in difficult situations. What had been characterized as pacing my entire life became re-defined. With my body and senses engaged in the world around me I would begin to sift through the cacophony of debris stuck inside my head. I had so many unprocessed memories waiting for their chance to be understood in my short term memory bank. Through aimlessness I was able to begin letting them arise in my mind and follow the train of thoughts and feelings that the memories evoked.\n\nI was re-introduced to the flow arts around this time in my healing journey (something I had only ever known as a fun and visually stimulating activity you see at festivals or in performance) and picked up poi.¬†\n\n\\[For people unfamiliar with flow props - poi is a ball at the end of a rope/string, typically utilized in a set of two\\]¬†\n\nI made my first pair out of some cord knotted at both ends with a tennis ball over one of the knots. Holding them felt right, like a security blanket. I took no traditional guidance in learning popular tricks, opting to just swing them around wildly in ways that seemed fit. I began carrying them with me everywhere I went, fidgeting with them almost constantly and in times of stress pausing what I was doing all together to step back and spin them in the patterns that had become familiar. The comfort felt while engaging in these practices compelled me to explore more activities of this nature, as poi had become a habit I would indulge in constantly - often being up throughout the night practicing the motions until dawn. Though I must clarify, it was not the activity keeping me up, trauma had long sense rendered me unable to sleep through the night, often only achieving rest once exhaustion was met. Flow gave me something to occupy that time with something that made me feel different, and better yet sped up the exhaustion process which resulted in me finally being able to get some sort of regulated rest back into my cycle.\n\nAt some point or another it clicked in my head that the physical exertion was beneficial to easing my suffering, and I became addicted to chasing that high (this is the language I would use with myself about the situation, as it felt like a guilty pleasure to find inner healing and growth. A form of self-deprecation that allowed my traumatized pattern of thought to slowly fight itself out). I restructured my life around being able to be physically active, bringing my poi with me to work and spending all my free time either at the gym or flowing in my backyard. I got physically strong as a result and discovered a feeling of self-pride and confidence that I had never known. My physical appearance was not the centerpiece of this pride either, but the confidence that I was capable of making changes in my life for the better.\n\nFor the first time in a long time, I felt the urge to expose myself to strangers and meet new people (I had kept myself secluded to only groups of people that were familiar with my trauma and capable of handling my outbursts). I had something I was passionate about that finally wasn't just obsessing over the life altering experiences I had gone through. Even if it was just a step away from the trauma and often led conversation back in that direction, it was different and that was good. Talking to people felt foreign, like learning a language for the first time. I had countless failures, but I grew to learn that these interactions would not hurt me like my anxiety anticipated. It felt freeing to disagree and to disappoint while staying true to myself and being genuine with others.\n\nMaking my first friend after the incident taught me so much, namely that there was so much more to who I was than the trauma that consumed my existence. I was not just some ‚Äúthing‚Äù that these events had happened to, I was an entire individual that had been a person before and continue to be a person after. Having someone want to know who I was felt transforming, and daunting. For a time I was convinced I needed to create a ‚Äúfixed‚Äù personality to introduce to people to be accepted. My outbursts transformed into an almost performative display, masked by things I had discovered could be expressed in polite company. I operated like this for a while, slowly rebuilding my understanding of strangers, leaving room to dismantle so much of the fear that had ruled my existence during and after the trauma.¬†\n\nOne of the changes I had experienced immediately after my event was a drastic change in perspective of what was important to me. Things that so often vexed me before seemed trivial compared to the big picture, like a switch had been shut off to caring about these things as a whole if it wasn't solution oriented (Don't like what you have to eat? -Get something you do like. Need money? -Shoot for careers that meet your needs. Person upsetting you? -Tell them and find common ground. Have a crush? -Confess it to them. Taxes? -Just file them and see what happens‚Ä¶etc). This mentality clashed heavily with the majority of strangers I came to interact with, but it was my perspective and continued to let it dictate my input into interactions I had. Part of me desperately wanted to care about such seemingly small things again, and so I would practice and allow myself to fall into situations that would typically evoke these ‚Äúsmaller‚Äù feelings in a safe environment I felt I could control.\n\nIt was not at all a speedy transition from forcing myself to experience little guaranteed let downs to letting myself cusp the idea of being happy. I came to recognize that the feeling of elation was far more uncomfortable to me than I anticipated. Seeing as it was ultimately the goal, it came as a depressing shock to find my body responding in ways I can only characterize as rejection. I often denied the possibility of feeling happy, for when I was experiencing it even if it was slight, my body would react negatively. I didn't trust that what I felt was happiness, because why would being happy feel so wrong? I did a lot of reading during this point in my growth, and I stumbled across the sentiment that happiness often feels ‚Äúwrong‚Äù when a person has amassed a majority of negative experiences and feelings. Regardless of its supposed ‚Äúgood‚Äù nature, happiness was not a regular response of my body. I felt more comfortable in an anxiety induced state of sickness than I did enjoying a genuinely positive experience. My body was scared to feel good.\n\nThis realization hammered in the notion that the body and mind experience things separately even though they work in tandem. It seemed like such a ‚Äúduh‚Äù moment of connecting the dots as to why I had seen greater improvement when I was focusing on my physical body. This encouraged me to focus less on what I thought would evoke happiness of mind (something I still viscerally struggled to accept within) and reconnect with the feelings my body would express. The majority of my physical journey had involved pushing myself to extremes, overcoming hurdles, and an overall sense of overstimulation. Even the state of meditation I was able to achieve was only reachable when physically activating all parts of my body ( I had invested in a yoga hammock so that I could flip myself upside down in the air, keeping my entire body focused on not dropping on my head allowed the thoughts within it to flow). I was stressing my body out to achieve ‚Äúrelaxation‚Äù.\n\nI didn't feel worthy of being allowed to experience simple physical happiness. How could I when I couldn't even achieve such base good feelings like being well rested or well fed? In learning to let good physical responses in, I unearthed many more traumas that had unknowingly faded into the foundation of who I was. Each one, when discovered, needed its own space to express and understand itself before being able to transform. As a whole I felt unfixable, but these realizations did not pop up all at once, and beginning to tackle them as they arose felt more and more manageable once I got the first few under my belt.\n\nEasing into gentler exercises I began flowing with a hoop as my prop, in my eyes it was much simpler, more room for error than poi. Spinning and learning to hoop was delightful in such new ways. I compared myself less to other artists, letting my flow simply become a dance between my mind and body. Practice sessions left me feeling light and hungry. My appetite slowly returned, for food and for excitement. I thought less of the struggles around feeding myself, indulging in foods I would otherwise ‚Äúnot waste money‚Äù on. It seems I had accidentally found my spark for life again. My writing progressed in new directions as well. Immediately after my event (and for some time prior) I could not string a set of words together that had any notion of joy or optimism. And yet there I was, seemingly suddenly able to add a glimmer of hope sprinkled throughout my expressions of despair.¬†\n\nThese small victories felt like conquering mountains along the path to cast my PTSD back into the fires from which it came. I still struggled heavily with having compassion for myself (even though in some part of me I knew I had to at least have some to have come so far) but I was able to provide it to others in droves again. My compassion for others had returned after being clouded by the pessimism that I would never feel better. Sharing kindness in turn gave me more examples of how I could be kinder to myself. I found a middle ground in self-communication after a practice from the Plum Village teachings seeped into me one day. The idea was to try to stay in balance while acknowledging life's situations. When life is going poorly, remind yourself of the positive times experienced, when life is going well, do not forget the struggles from which we come, and the eventual return back to either state at some point. This sentiment made me feel that perhaps there was still a place for me in this existence after all, even as negative as I had become.\n\nI let that notion of balance drive the next chapter of my growth. I started acknowledging that I was nurturing my suffering and creating a space for me to heal within. As I kept claiming to be making changes for the sake of myself, I noticed more and more areas of my life that were unconducive for improvement. I needed to start making larger, more drastic changes if my goals were to be reachable. Situations and places that before had brought me comfortability were now glaring me in the face as sufferings I had become complacent with. So, I pressed on, giving people in situations the opportunity to change, and when they were unable, I would plan my evacuation route and find ways to cut ties that would be safe for all parties involved. These were incredibly difficult shifts and came with many sufferings of change. Yet overall, the changes made way for greater joys and meaningful steps forward.\n\nNow I was entering one of the more treacherous stages of healing, I had shed ties with many dangerous comforts from my existence and was paving my way into a life I felt I could call my own. Up until this point I had had a great many inspirations for self-preservation, but I noticed the further along I got, the less examples I had of people who had progressed past just ditching the harms in their surrounding circle to feel peace. I began to recognize the potential damage of lingering in this in-between stage too long. I had a front row seat of my concerns playing out before my very eyes, one of my former mentors. They had been pivotal to inspiring me to push to make some tough jumps and cut certain ties. It was discouraging to see them not seem to grow past that same stage from the time they had inspired myself to make the shift to the point that I now felt I would surpass them if I kept going. I hadn't known what the next step could be, as now I lacked examples of success beyond this point, but after observation of the continual ‚Äúpushing away from harm‚Äù stage‚Äôs backfire, I knew whatever direction I went needed to hold space for others to exist and heal as well, rather than just prioritize my own.\n\nI became somewhat obsessed with checking myself to be sure I wasn't destroying my valued connections with the wonderful people I still had left in my life, which I came to realize meant letting other people become priorities again now that I had thinned the crop to only those capable of supporting my growth. I had spent so much time focusing inward that I almost forgot there was a whole world still operating around me. Self-healing had been my only focus up until this point, and now it was time to slowly sift into the life I had been setting up for myself. At this juncture the ‚Äúsmall things‚Äù had begun to matter again without me even realizing it, I was able to deepen connections with those left in my circle by creating space for them and their emotions as I had done for myself. Now when I spoke of suffering, optimism lurked around every corner.\n\nThis practice of communication has carried me into the stage I currently reside in (for the time being). It feels unnatural to say that life is going well, yet to claim the opposite would be false. One of my biggest struggles that I am working on currently is my own ability to self-sabotage. When things finally begin to feel like they are going right, doubt and suspicion rear their heads. Though rather than fight or silence it like I would have been previously inclined, I try to nurture it for what it is and hear out the fears. This can help determine if they are based in reality, and rather than reacting to the ones that are, I talk through them with myself or others. It does wonders for my fears simply to be heard.",

    "selftext": "I have diagnosed PTSD from having dealt with emotional abuse from a close friend for a while. I wish I could be able to sleep, but for the last 4 months I haven't been able to sleep at all. Whenever I finally get to bed, the flashbacks come flooding in, and I feel too stressed and anxious to fall asleep. I'll often roll around for hours and hours, panicking and crying. If I am able to get to sleep (often with the aid of physical exertion or alcohol), I can only sleep in 30 minute-1 hr increments, before I end up having some sort of nightmare pertaining to the abuse which swiftly wakes me. As soon as I wake up, I always begin crying, panicking, and hyperventilating, just as I was prior to getting to bed in the first place. I feel that my relationship with sleep has become incredibly tainted. I now just have intense anxiety whenever I think about sleeping or merely sitting in my bedroom. There was one instance lately where I was up for 40 hours straight due to all of these negative emotions I was having. Less dramatically, each night I can really only get myself to rest 4-5 hours at the maximum, and my attempt at rest is so tumultuous, that I just feel more exhausted than I did before. I hardly feel alive anymore, especially considering I can't have the solace of sleep. I haven't seen good, proper rest in such a long time and I feel hopeless in ever fixing that since i've already tried so much. I had to see my abuser yesterday and every time I get sharp pain in my chest, have a panic attack (or get close to it), and immediately feel hopeless, afraid, trapped, and infinitely on-edge. Seeing her immediately reaccesses all of my trauma in the most disturbing way. I was able to sleep for like an hour before a nightmare about seeing her yesterday woke me up. Besides that, i've been up for over 24 hours. I keep replaying everything she has ever said and done to me, and I continually feel worse and worse. I'm afraid that if I don't get to sleep soon, I may have a mental breakdown and start sobbing, but i'm trying my best to keep it together. I'm going to try and distract myself for a little bit even though it'll likely be unsuccessful. I just wanted to vent in hopes that i'll feel even marginally better because I really don't know what to do right now. I feel so tortured. ",

For comparison I was diagnosed with BPD at the age of 15 in 2000, recieved no help, experienced abuse from the place I was diagnosed, and was not aware of this diagnosis until 2016 when I went back to the hospital that diagnosed me as a kid (which also refused to acknowledge that I had PTSD until 2020, never acknowledged or treated my ADHD diagnosed in 2003, and treated me like a pariah due to the BPD misdiagnosis). Throughout this time I was a person with unrecognized autism trying to make it in a workplace without accommodations, facing profound discrimination leading to repeated terminations, and coming home to copious amounts of abuse and rejection from relationships I stayed in to meet my needs, my dysfunctional family, and the every present demands of just living as a moderate support needs autistic person who internalized the profound ableism, judgement, and emotional abuse of the world around me.

Throughout all this I had minimal if any friends, everyone left, and once the denial broke and I entered therapy I faced abuse while there, including being thrown out of a treatment program and forced to move back to the abusive home I tried to leave 3000 miles away from my best friend and the first time I was ever able to develop a safe community. \n\nThroughout all this time I tried to work and live as independently as possible.

I couldn‚Äôt afford to do what I went to school for and when I finally got a job doing what I wanted to do I lost it within 4 months because despite using the job as the push to escape an abusive relationship and move across the country, I found my self in yet another abusive relationship, this time 3x worse than before. And this was a pattern. Find some piece of shit to rescue me and take care of me because I knew that the job would not last and in the process lose the very thing that could allow me the means to escape the abuse. Again I had NO idea I had autism and while I knew I had ADHD I just was told to take stimulants which much of the time I couldn‚Äôt afford, suck it up and work my ass off despite going through hell my entire life. \n\nI kept running, finding some stupid ass low paying job where I was subjected to repeated accounts of secondary trauma (and even witnessed trauma myself including watching a child almost starve to death), lost the job, spent several months trying to find another one, only to lose it 6-12 months later over a misunderstanding or some bitch ass, sociopathic supervisor not liking me and treating me like so many of the mean girls and bullies I experienced from the time I was 4. I even once got fired for ‚Äúpoor judgement‚Äù and ‚Äúunprofessionalism‚Äù while I watched my supervisor repeatedly stalk clients on their social media and openly mock them to other coworkers (she also made fun of my disabilities to my face and did not hide her disdain for me). I had yet another supervisor tell me how talented I was as she fired me and I received an award for the work I did (and self financed because the program did not have a budget and I was essentially fired for requesting one and getting upset that I had to use my AMERICORPS salary to finance this) two weeks after the program terminated me and I saw none of the grant money I worked my ass off to get.  \n\nSo for all this on November 12th, 2023 there was a misunderstanding at work. I was frustrated and exhausted because I had no PTO to take time off to see a show because all my PTO was used for ‚Äúmental health days‚Äù and to recover from the multiple illnesses my body acquired from working with children and dealing with a lifetime of chronic stress. I said something that was intended to poise a question, but was said in the wrong context. People freaked the fuck out and due to client confidentiality and fear for the safety of the client I could not say anything to defend myself. I dealt with this only to enter a meeting where a parent (not the parent involved in this situation)sat there for 20 minutes accusing me of lying about what I said, not giving a shit about their kid after spending hours trying to find specialized care for them, and telling me I was a piece of shit. I just lost it then and gave up trying to fight. 15 years of fighting gone. \n\nSo for those of you who have suffered copious amounts of abuse and trauma, how the fuck do you reconcile that because of the shit people have done to you, you will never be afforded the opportunity to break free and will always be stuck dependent on people who may very well be just as abusive as the ones who initially caused the PTSD. \n\nI did every fucking thing people told me to do. College, internships, graduate school at an elite private school, study abroad, unpaid practicum, volunteering, etc and for what? To face the possibility of receiving $1200 a month for the rest of my life if someone who has never met me decides that I am worthy of such a ‚Äúgenerous‚Äù sum of money and if I was sick enough during the time some fucking government agency decided the hell I was subjected to was enough to determine me eligible for SSDI and not SSI and if me going back to work after being told I was crazy by a boss that denied me access to my therapist and 2 weeks after I nearly died from a gallbladder surgery is worth it. \n\nFor those in this situation how the hell do you make sense of the idea that because of the actions of others your safety is again compromised and if it were not for my boyfriend‚Äôs generosity (he‚Äôs safe and kind thank god) I would be homeless and/or back in the home I‚Äôve been trying to escape since I was 19. Please make this make sense because I spent my life trying to help others after all most did was hurt me over and over and over and over again. \n\nI guess the 25 year old idealistic, naive, and hopeful young adult who looked at my mother, while in deep denial of the situations that had occurred and were currently occurring around her, and told her that I ‚Äúwant to suffer too‚Äù had no idea what she was in for and got a bit of sweet poetic justice people only wish upon their worst enemies.

He has PTSD which remains untreated, anxiety, and bipolar 2 with cluster b personality disorder. \n\nHe does take seroquel and a mood stabilizer but I don't think that's helping him with where he needs to be. I love him more than anything on God's green earth, but I need him to take action about his mental health. We have not been able to speak since this took place, as a no contact order was put in place. \n\nBefore this happened we had finally taken big strides in our relationship, and he was open with me about alot of his insecurities. We talked about getting help for him. \n\nHis family \"cares\" but not in the way that they need to in order to really be supportive. They blame me for his behaviors, and have been attacking me since I tried to talk to them about what's going on. \n\nHe knows how out of control he can get, but I think he might still feel betrayed. \n\nI have reached out to the public defender, the ER justice outreach, and I am going to file a waiver of prosecution.\n\nObviously his mental health is the priority and making sure everyone has a stable environment. But do you think he will be so upset that he won't speak to me again? \n\nThis has been tortuous. He's by best friend. I haven't had a day apart from him really in three years except when he goes to see his kids. \n\nDoes anyone have any legal advice for the situation? \n\nAlot of people think I am stupid, but I don't think he is an abuser. I think he does have a problem. I am going to use the time period of this no contact order to try to cope with my own emotions and triggers around his mental illness and other meltdowns and fallout. \n\nI really hope that after this, we can focus on our healing and be together again.  I know separation right now isn't the end of the world, and we can each benefit from the space. \n\nSidenote: he and his siblings own the property together. He asked me to move in a year into our relationship. We've been together since. His brother lives elsewhere. Since this happened, he has tried to change locks, put dirt in my stuff, turned off the power to the home. He is very rude to me and won't listen to my concerns. It's like running salt in a wound. \n\nAnybody have any advice at all? I wish I had any insight into how he might feel right now by people who understand. He served in afghanistan and Iran after 9/11. \n\nWhether we have to end things, or he doesn't want any reconciliation, I still don't want his life ruined when he could be rehabilitated. \n\nI'm so stressed and scared. \n\nAnyone? \n\n",

    "selftext": "I am a 17 Year old who lives with both Parents and a Brother (19 year old). We were raised in an not bad household. Our Mother was always watching out for us since we were kids. She had her eyes on us 24/7 and loved us much. Our Father also loved us much but showed it us indirectly. But things turned tables when we got to like 8-10 years of Age. My Father started influencing us alot by talking about problems and stuff. We always got blamed at relatives for doing things you dont do at this age anymore. My Father always told every secret of our family to them and stuff. It was exhausting. My Mother was also against it and tried always giving him his fault. They always were argued and it started at like 14-15 were it started to hit us mentally. They always did this on purpose. My Brother wasnt hit mentally as hard. He lives like a normal life. But it hit me very hard since i was 14-15. This always arguing wasnt the part that got me mentally killed tho. It was that my mother always watched out after me since toddler and developed and phobic psycho issue were she always had to watch out for me. When i was 10 she tried everything for me to stay at home. Whenever i had school she followed me to school with her bike till the age of 13! I always told her i dont want this but she never did listen. She was already called by relatives a psycho of her phobic behavior. The teenage years of 10-17 she never let me out. She always tried to look after me. Whenever she saw like an car driving near me she screamed in public watch out and stuff. Like an real psycho. Whenever she did this tho i always started to get mentally ill. I always walked away from her in public like i dont know her. She always tried to help others. Even when its meant to laugh at her own children or tell their secrets nobody should know to satisfy others. \n\nNow that i am 17 Years Old things have gotten alot worse. I actually started resisting. Whenever my Father comes home i tell him hey. Sometimes he fells good and when he feels bad he dosent say anything but just tells me to fuck off. I started my Business at 15 because i wanted to do something out of myself. My Father was very proud at first and told all my relatives that i did this and that. But then when things didnt went to good. He didnt stick to me. He started talking bad about this and that that you are destroying the family with this business so his mood was either when things went good and bad. Now that i have gotten Mentally completely ill (skipping work so i dont feel bad, having depression) he starts saying my son doesnt do this and that. He always puts me down everyday. EVERY fucking day he tells me i am this bad and this bad. And this isnt even the bad thing. My family always argues every day literally it got to the point where its impossible to just do my thing. I hardly try to speak to them but hey always involve me in stuff and then tell i do everything wrong my father then says i wish i never born children. Go out of my house. My Mother then argues with him and they almost fight. This is now everyday minimum 2x times a day and it drains my energy i dont eat most times or dont do the things i want i dont leave the house because i have depression. Now the even bigger problem is my mother does prevent me from sleeping. When it gets to like 9-10pm my mother just randomly starts saying now you go to sleep. And i am okay with that. But then she repeats it everyday minimum 10 times. So her Goal is to fuck my head over to sleep. Then when i actually lay in Bed at like 11 pm she screams now go to sleep. And i say yes i will then she comes in my Room again and again and again then she starts screaming and then she goes at living room and starts banging on my wall aware that my father is sleeping. She wants to make me sleep on force rather than find my sleeping schedule. Whenever i ask my friends parents if they do this they never said yes. I have no parent seen do this. \n\nAll in all i know there might be many opinions on this but all i can say for me. This family is not normal. Sleep prevention, Always screaming giving each other faults. Enjoying the process of killing your son mentally. I just dont know what i can do anymore to this. Everybody in this Family is literally bringing hate in family everyday and i just cant stand it without getting physical abusive with them. They never hit me or anything like that but sometimes i just always think about it.\n\nI have found out that i may suffer from one of these things:\nADHS (However, suppressed by depression i am not angry all the time i never am, i am just very active when my depression fades a way for 1 hour or so rather than that i am always down 24/7)\nSocial Anxiety\nInsomnia (probably because of Parents)\nPTSD\nHyperthyroidism\nbehavioral disorder\n\ntelogenes effluvium\n\n\n\nPlease tell me what i can do and feel free to ask any questions.",

    "selftext": "Hello! I (23f) have recently been going to therapy as I feel like I have things that i was in denial of that I need to work out. I see my therapist every other Tuesday. Last time I went (about a month ago due to me and family getting COVID) she said that she thinks I have PTSD. I would agree with her. \nI have experienced several forms of trauma. My uncle is an abusive alcoholic who put a gun to my mom‚Äôs head. My grandfather was too handsy with me. When my mom married the second time, the guy was really nice until after they married. Then he would beat my mom and I. I had carbon monoxide poisoning (due to our landlord) and was sitting on the back of an ambulance while the doctors checked my brother and I. All the while, I watched my mom, grandmother, aunt, and other firemen go grab ALL of our stuff and moved it out. I‚Äôve been stuck in the middle of a ‚Äòrapid rising‚Äô river, almost not making it back to my group. I‚Äôve seen my entire town flood. When I was a kid I broke my jaw really bad. \nSince I was a child, I‚Äôve had nightmares. I‚Äôd wake up screaming and crying for my mom. For the past year (at least) I‚Äôve been having what I call stress dreams EVERY night. It‚Äôs to the point that I‚Äôm tired all the time but I don‚Äôt want to sleep because I know I‚Äôll stress more and wake up more tired. I did get a little bit of a break the night of my brothers wedding. I had officiated and made another speech. By the end of the day, I crashed hard. No dreams. The next night it went back to normal. \nNow, my dreams aren‚Äôt always about the actual events of my trauma. I often have dreams of the world ending and the sky getting red. The darker the red, the closer to the end of the world other dreams, we are in the woods, running from something. Other times, the world is flooding and my mom and I cannot contact anyone. When we try to leave, we get blocked by the police because everything up ahead is already under water. I‚Äôve dreamt that I‚Äôm on a boat in the middle of the ocean in the night and it wrecks. I would look under me in the water and a shark was right there, mouth open. I‚Äôd have dreams about needing another surgery. I don‚Äôt wake up screaming but my dreams leave me very distressed when I do wake up. I am anxious, sad, mad, stressed, and overwhelmed when I wake up and those feelings last all day. Last nights dream was particularly intense. \n\n‚ÄòMy brother and his wife were giving birth. It was a home birth in their bathtub. My mom and I are sitting on the couch in the living room, waiting for the news. My brother and sil come out with one baby. A boy. They say they had twins. I ask where the other one is and brother said ‚Äòin the bathroom‚Äô. I asked if I could go in and see the baby and he said ‚Äòyou can go in‚Äô. So I do and I see a pale baby with the umbilical cord still attached, floating face down in the tub. I grab the baby and while pulling it out of the water, I noticed that it is cold and stiff. It‚Äôs a girl. I try to do CPR and holler out to call an ambulance then I wake up.‚Äô I cried when I woke up. \nIm exhausted all the time and I just want simple happy dreams or none at all. Im so sorry for the lengthy post I just don‚Äôt know what else to do. The I‚Äôve tried so many medications and they haven‚Äôt worked. Anyways, no more pity party and back to the question.\nWhen I describe these dreams, I don‚Äôt know what to call them. Whether they are bad dreams or nightmares or stress dreams or what have you. Any advice is much appreciated and if anyone has any ideas on how to manage my feelings I will happily ready everything! Thanks in advance and good night! ",

    "selftext": "I‚Äôve been in treatment for my eating disorder since July. I‚Äôve really enjoyed the program and this is the longest and best I‚Äôve ever been in recovery. Last week we were introduced to the new psychodrama therapist. I have zero experience with it, and quite frankly roleplaying negative experiences of my life (not even the traumatic ones) in a group setting just does not appeal to me.\n\nThis was our first actual group and from the very beginning I knew I was in for a shitshow. The therapist starts off by saying ‚ÄúI want you to think of a time when you were truamatized‚Äù. The first thing I thought of was my sexual assault in the psych ward by another patient while I was in a medication induced psychosis.\n\nNow look, one could argue that I could‚Äôve just chosen a little T trauma instead, but for whatever reason I went with the worst moment of my life. Either way though if you ask me about trauma and that‚Äôs where my brain goes, so immediately all of the memories started surfacing again. 5 minutes into the group and I‚Äôm already distressed.\n\nShe made us one by one tell her about our traumas and most of the clients voiced their discomfort, but she seemed very dismissive about it. When I told mine, she asked ‚ÄúSo that was traumatizing for you?‚Äù Uh‚Ä¶ no shit?\n\nOur next assignment was to close our eyes and envision what we were feeling in that moment, essentially having us relive our traumas. For obvious reasons I did not do this.\n\nAfter that she passed out paper and markers and had us draw our emotions. Fine, whatever.\n\nShe had us get up and talk to the drawings like they were the source of the trauma (i.e. a family member, an abuser, etc.). The first girl that went was no issue.\n\nHere‚Äôs where it gets worse.\n\nThe next person that went had trauma revolving around a family member. I won‚Äôt give details obviously, but as he progressed the therapist started mirroring him and essentially saying what she thought he was feeling internally. \n\nThere was a point where she just yelled something that was clearly very triggering for him and he broke immediately. He started sobbing and yelling the things he would‚Äôve said to this family member and it was incredibly distressing to watch and made a ton of repressed memories of my own familial trauma resurface.\n\nOne of my biggest triggers is yelling, even if it‚Äôs not directed at me. The second the yelling started I felt like I became detached from my body, like none of this was actually real. I‚Äôve never felt like that before and it was genuinely terrifying. Obviously I do not blame the client for one second, but for the first time since I started treatment, I got up and left group.\n\nThe second I closed the door to the group room I started sobbing and hyperventilating. I‚Äôll be real, it takes a lot to break me so when the clinical director saw me she immediately knew it was bad. She went and grabbed my individual therapist who basically had to sit there and help me ground myself until I could speak again.\n\nWhen I explained to him what happened during group he told me that essentially I derealized. I have friends who experience it, but this is all new to me.\n\nI‚Äôve been texting back and forth with the other clients and every single one said they felt incredibly uncomfortable with the whole process.\n\nSo yeah, not a fan of psychodrama. :)",

    "selftext": "Being here in LA for these catastrophic wildfires this past week, seeing these entire neighborhoods ravaged and shattered, and having to evacuate from the fires myself has triggered some kind of trauma I (30y/o) didn't realize I had been holding on to for the past 12 or so years from living in an affected community in New York during Hurricane Sandy. \n\nThe year prior to Sandy, my family had evacuated for another hurricane (Irene in 2011) and ended up getting hit worse where we evacuated to, so we had decided to stay in place for Sandy. The power went out. The floodwater began churning through the streets and rising higher, engulfing our driveway, our lawn, pouring in through the doors. We tried to save as many of our belongings as possible, wading through thigh-deep mucky seawater as it filled our house in total darkness.\n\n  \nIn the days following as the flooding subsided, we ripped damaged furniture, carpeting, walls, appliances, and belongings out of my childhood home with our own hands before rot could set in. A nor'easter followed just days later, dumping nearly a foot of snow and downing power lines across the community. Weeks went by without power restoration. We lived in the wreckage of our house for months, without heat or insulation, without clean water or a way to cook. My parents were among the many to be taken advantage of and scammed and run around by bogus contractors rushing to make money in the wake of the hurricane and though I have since moved, they are *still* struggling with shoddy repairs and fraudulent permits, more than a decade later.\n\n  \nWhile my current partner and our pets and I were in the car last week evacuating from the wildfires, I was fighting to suppress rising memories of this time. It's been a week and my mind is flooded with these thoughts of losing everything. We and our animals are safe, and our dwelling and belongings have been thankfully untouched, but I still find myself inundated with strong and complicated emotions that I am unable to organize in my brain. I've been crying every day. I haven't been able to work. I've been struggling to sleep. \n\n  \n\n\nI don't know where I was going with this, I just needed a place to get it all out onto paper hoping it would help. Not sure what else to do or how to get back to normal. Thanks for listening.",

    "selftext": " ok this is like totally tmi and i‚Äôve never shared anything like this before, especially not online, but about two months ago, on the night of my son‚Äôs first birthday, i was raped anally by someone very very close to me. since then, i can‚Äôt seem to process anything. i have similar trauma from my childhood that i can think through in detail and map out on a mental timeline. but with this particular event, my brain will not let me think about it. every time i try to think about the events leading up to it, during it, or even weeks after it, i feel like my brain just shuts down and i can‚Äôt properly remember anything. i‚Äôm in a near constant state of dissociation. \n\n i have a one year old son and i‚Äôm honestly kind of glad my brain is responding like this because it allows me to behave relatively normally and take care of my child like a regular mother. in my high school years i behaved incredibly recklessly due to past trauma and landed myself in rehabs and mental institutions more times than i‚Äôd like to admit. obviously i‚Äôm a very different person now and would never act on my impulsive thoughts considering i have a baby in the picture. however, after my son goes to sleep it‚Äôs like all hell breaks lose. all of a sudden i feel like i can‚Äôt sleep despite being EXHAUSTED the entire day. no matter how hard i try i just can‚Äôt get myself to lay down. my brain floods with thoughts of self harm, suicide and other risky behaviors. and i can‚Äôt shut it off no matter what i do. i feel so helpless. the whole night i‚Äôm trying to keep calm and make it to morning. pacing back and forth or watching tv to distract myself. God forbid the show has a joke about anal though or i literally start tweaking the fuck out lol i know that sounds stupid but i genuinely get panic attacks from jokes like that even if it has nothing to do with rape. which sucks cause we live in a culture where anal is a very normal thing so jokes like that are in basically everything. i usually only can get myself to go to sleep at around 5 am after my fianc√© comes home (he works night shift) which is absolutely not sustainable as my son has a normal sleep schedule (asleep by 9 pm). and when i do finally get to sleep, it‚Äôs just brutal gruesome nightmares. i never ever feel rested. most days i find myself sleeping in past noon, usually around 2 or 3, while my fianc√© takes care of our son. i feel so guilty. this is killing me and it‚Äôs absolutely not sustainable. \n\n when i do wake up, i genuinely feel like a zombie. no amount of sleep ever feels like enough. \n\n taking care of my son comes naturally to me so that‚Äôs not an issue. i usually just play with him all day and we go for walks and to the park and everything is fine. i smile and play and talk to him and it reminds me of a time where i felt happier and wasn‚Äôt just faking my way through life. the whole time i‚Äôm barely hanging on. but like i don‚Äôt even feel sad. i just feel empty and out of it. so exhausted and just completely beat down. nothing feels okay anymore. i‚Äôm totally dissociated during the day and completely hyper vigilant at night. it‚Äôs literally driving me crazy. \n\n i seriously don‚Äôt know how to fix this. i can‚Äôt take medication to sleep cause i need to not be knocked out if my baby starts crying in the middle of the night and needs me (which he frequently does). obviously can‚Äôt smoke weed or anything. i have no one to talk to either. the only two people who know are my fianc√© (who kind of acts weird about it and is also very close to the man who assaulted me so it‚Äôs kind of an odd situation where he doesn‚Äôt want to fully admit something bad happened) and my ex best friend. when i told her she said that i absolutely have to go to the police and when i refused, she ended the friendship and called me a bitch lmao. i‚Äôm catholic and the only thing that‚Äôs sort of helps and brings me some sort of peace is going to church. but it‚Äôs not a cure or anything. i still live with my parents (i‚Äôm only 19) and they have no idea. it‚Äôs so disturbing watching everyone act like everything‚Äôs normal while simultaneously harboring this dark secret that could blow up my whole life and the lives of so many other people, while also being the victim of it all. i almost feel angry at the whole world for not realizing something is wrong. but also i would never ever want anyone to find out. anyways i‚Äôm considering going back to therapy but i lowkey don‚Äôt have a drivers license and my fianc√© takes the car to work everyday so not sure what to do. if u have any advice PLEASE  share. i‚Äôm so desperate and willing to listen",

Because of the trust issues stemming from my PTSD, I'm quite delayed when it comes to romantic relationships. Last month, however, I met a girl and we've really hit it off. We've been on multiple dates, text constantly, and she's even spent a few nights at my apartment.\n\nI like this girl a lot. She is so kind, patient, and understanding, and talking and spending time with her is really fun. I feel like I have so much more energy after spending time with her, and like I can feel my life getting better in real time. Not to mention, she's really cute. I should be euphoric, right?\n\nInstead, I'm constantly worrying. Can I trust this person? Will she try to control me? If I don't do what she wants, will she hurt me? Despite the fact that she hasn't shown the slightest bit of violence or controlling behavior towards me, these are the thoughts that plague me whenever we're apart and sometimes even when we're together. I can be enjoying an evening with her, having a good time, and then suddenly, I'll feel trapped and overwhelmed and like I just want her to leave. Fortunately, she's very understanding. Though I haven't given her the gory details of my trauma, she knows I have PTSD and I've given her a basic overview of how it affects my relationships (namely, how it makes me freak out and think people who want to get close to me are bound to hurt/kill me). She's said that if I ever need it, we can just drop everything and do separate things for a few hours or even that she can just go for a walk so I have some private space to calm myself down.\n\nI'm just really frustrated at how these feelings make me feel like shit even when she's so wonderful, and especially how they seem to dull the positive emotions I should have. I'd like to ask how you all coped with the difficulties presented by PTSD in your romantic relationships. Did you just push through them until you'd finally developed trust with the other person? Were there strategies you used to quiet the negative, fearful voices that constantly intruded on the relationship? I'd also love if you all could share any resources that were helpful to you, like books, worksheets, videos, etc.  \n\nThank you!\n\n(BTW, I have also recently started seeing a therapist again, in case that's relevant)",

Nope, not a damn thing lately. But here I am, out of work for now because going there sends me into a spiral. Staying home feels safe, but every day my spouse goes into work I am met with going into a spiral again just a lot less. Insurance sees it as a work issue, not covered by them. WCB sees my medical file and sees I'm trans, says that there is no way to prove my stress is only work related, no coverage from them. Police see it all as an interpersonal conflict, no help from them. Union sees it as \"we have to listen to all sides\" issue, no help from them. Employer keeps asking if I just want to quit already (they sent me paperwork to give for unemployment filings encouraging me to given my notice), no help from them. Gone through a number of therapists, some stating beyond scope, others trying but so limited on what can be done about the situation, no help from them. Friends of ours just don't know how to help, typically just start weeping, or have been so burnt out by it all so no help from them. Spouse is a mess some days, but dissociates easily. Field we are in is best paying, best benefits, without it our life saving medications are not available.

I'm in resilience training and I can say that other's in similar situations as me are struggling to find worth from the whole thing because what can we realistically get out of it?

I can function daily well enough that I don't warrant disability, but when I go into workplaces that find out (and do to legal things with background checks it's not hard to figure out) I am met with hostility. What the hell do I do? What therapy can help me through this? Shitty life syndrome makes CBT feel like a stupid gaslighting chore of accepting that life sucks and suck it up buttercup, enjoy your harassment. I know that is not what it is but when the therapist says, there is nothing I can do to help you, I don't think anyone can. What do you fucking do? I feel failed by life because of populist politics using me as a scape goat. \n\nI breathe, I exercise, I eat well, I do physio, I do somatic exercises, I do journalling, I do therapy, I spend time with friends, I engage in hobbies, I limit screen time, I wash myself up and take care of myself. I don't drink and I don't do recreational drugs. I still feel dread, panic, and then have flashes of images of people harming my loved ones because I'M trans. I promptly dissociate and I dissociate a lot. What more can I do? I took medications but the side effects after six months were great and I stopped showering and no longer enjoyed my hobbies at all. I have tried others with no luck, and I don't want medication anymore when things are so situational based. \n\nThis isn't hopeless and I find joy in little things involving my spouse, involving friends, in the joys in life. There is so much joy in life. Employment brings me no joy and it is painful, I've already lost 3 jobs because of my trans status. \n\nI have attempted radical acceptance of this situation I cannot control but I am left feeling a level of rancor which impacts my ability to enjoy life. I don't want to accept that people like myself have to accept harassment and persecution. I have been active in social movements and it gives me some purpose but I find that they are being met with so much hatred that I don't know how many more violent assaults I can endure witnessing. What the hell do I even do? \n\nDoes anyone know resources for those trapped in violent areas, or just like... Resources that can actually ease this? I hate this and it feels like the more happy I am, the more bitter certain individuals become towards me. Even with cisgender (the opposite of transgender, just a non-transgender person) folks I know have told me how it isn't fair that I can access therapy and they can't. Or it isn't fair I'm married and found someone and they can't as a non-trans person. It isn't fair that I can still laugh and smile when I play with my pets, etc. and how lucky I am I'm not working right now and \"milking it.\" It isn't fair that I have stable housing and they don't. This is such a joke to me and I find it weird that folks like this exist that would say these things. \n\nA ramble to say the least, but I just hope there are resources out there online that is available internationally to people (I am not based in the US).

I never thought it could lead to ptsd, because I was so used to the pain I was in all the time. I'll try to keep it short (tw: self-harm, suicide)\n\n1. When I was 14 I started to harm myself.  My dad was emotionally abusing my mom, but we were forced to show off a fake smile everyday. He was never abusive to me though (this is important for the bigger picture). So I started to cope by hurting myself. This went on for 4 years during which no one figured out. I only stopped once I realised in therapy how unhealthy that is for me.\n\n2. My sister tried to end her life at 13, three years ago. It was out of the blue. I had my first severe panic attack that day and things were never the same. I was left with flashbacks, recurrent panic attack, I started abusing alcohol and cigarettes. I was also recurrently losing contact with reality for brief periods of time. The pain of the memory was too great. \n\n3. Last month my gf passed out in college. She has multiple health issues, two of which are pretty serious (an autoimmune disorder and recurrent bouts of urticatia, the reason she passed out and ended up in the ER). You see, this seems pretty little, but it triggered something inside me. I can't say why, but it made me go back to my panic attack, anxiety, I am in constant stress that something will happen again, I get flashbacks and intrusive thoughs, I am very distrustful of people. It's like I'm waiting for something to happen again. \n\nConsidering this, my therapist recognised ptsd. I was surprised because none of the above happened TO ME. But something did happen to me, because I'm not the same and I haven't been in a while. I have most of the textbook symptoms, except I only learnt recently they are ptsd symptoms.

    "title": "How Do You Handle Nightmares?",
    "selftext": " (TW: S-side, Dr*GS, Domestic V.)\n\nBefore stating this, I want to say I go to therapy and I try to stay on top of triggers and noticing when I'm going to start shutting down. By the end of this it will make sense why I'm here.\n\nSo, my first memory was at the age of 3 or 4 (parents can't verify what age) and it's a heavy one. During an argument between my parents, my dad pushed my mom. Since he had sworn to never do that (and he suffered from untreated illness and loved drugs) his first response was to grab a steak knife, drive it into his wrist, and pull up. I vividly remember the skin separating as the blood spurted on our off-white colored fridge. My brother was less than a year old at the time, so I grabbed the baby carrier he was in and went running for help at my grandparents who lived just down the hill. From there on is mostly a blur. I remember sitting at the hospital with my mom and brother, both of them crying uncontrollably as little me tried to comfort them. He survived that attempt, luckily. But it was far from over.\n\nOver the next 20 years of my life I saw him die, attempt, or come close to attempting 8 other times. 4 of those were the same method as before, the one that stuck with me the most being when he paced around outside of my grandparents' house for some time before using his pocket knife while leaning up against my grandma's bus. Another that always comes up is when he took a family member's pistol and put it in his mouth with full intent. My sister was just a toddler then and I made sure her and my brother were inside without much of a clue that Dad was about to do something irreversible. My grandfather managed to get the gun away from him just in time. He was in martial arts, so disarming someone came naturally. But that's not the end to it all either.\n\nOn three different occasions I witnessed him overdose and begin to cross over. The first was when I was 5. After an argument with my mom he decided to smoke something off of foil (I was born in 96, so this was before fentanyl, he was doing heroin) afterwards he slumped down in the couch as his eyes rolled back, nothing I wasn't already used to. But this time he stopped breathing altogether, and began to turn blue. I was oddly calm about the situation, telling my mom \"dad'll be okay\" or something along those lines. I thought he was just really high. But that image is burned into my head. Like I said, there's many more of these memories that I won't discuss here, as these are the biggest ones.\n\nFast forward to 2023. After seeing him relapse 8 years prior, I knew the day would come. One day after work I had the urge to get taco bell. He forced my mom and siblings out of the house so he was all alone, with me checking in him nearly every day, staying as long as I could stomach the company he kept. This day I didn't see any cars there. For a split second I debated whether to check on him or go get us Tacos and check on the way back. When I went to the door, I heard light movement, but got no answer at the door. My instincts from childhood kicked in, so I kicked in the door to find my father turning a shade of blue and growing cold fast. I immediately called the emergency services and frantically paced back and forth, waiting for help to arrive (if I knew CPR I would have tried, but I didn't want to make things worse). Medics and police arrived, tried narcan, and when it didn't work, rushed him to the hospital. It set me back what felt like years on my healing journey, and threw my whole life off. He survived but he hasn't been the same since. It still hurts my heart, but I don't speak on it much.\n\nSince then the nightmares are more frequent again, with the most recent being today. After finally falling asleep I had a crazy dream where close to the end, that pistol attempt was successful. The image was so vivid I don't know if I can go back to sleep. I guess all I'm really writing here for is some support and advice. Like what do you do when it becomes impossible to sleep without seeing things? I usually take trazadone to sleep when this happens, but lately it results in my brain doubling down on said nightmares. How do you navigate these kinds of things? For the most part I feel I've reached a point of high functionality but these nightmares put me in a headspace that physically feels weird.",

Men look at me all the time and I am unfazed and don't care.  \n\nEventhough I am very beautiful I know that it's a doubled edged curse.  It's been weaponized against me by sick, crazy men throughout my life.  I though going for a normal appearing awkward guy was safe.  My husband played the \"pick me, I'm safe\" role.  He played it so well that I did not realize that he was a total empathy empty person until after I was pregnant when our cat died.  I think I am actually a victim of marriage fraud and reproductive coercion.  Impregnated almost immediately, even directly following a miscarriage without healing first.  He was finally arrested for misdemeanor assault during an exchange of our son.  He harasses me still filming me at every exchange.  He is legitimately insane, and I believe a danger to our child.\n\nI'm not sure if I will get advice.  But after all the years of abuse in my life, sexually I am now repulsed by men.

Why would I ever live with someone or be legally entrapped in another abuser's sick web of lies?  It's not as if an abuser is like, \"Hey ladies, I mistreat women, because I can and I do it and enjoy it.\"  They do not show you who they really are until you are caught and they think they can keep you no matter how badly they treat you or how many enablers justify their behavior, even at the expense of a child.

Additionally i remember he used to consistently as me to sit on his lip, where he‚Äôd caress the inside of my thighs and upper leg. i have this one particular remember (and i know it happened more then once)  where he once again got me to sit on his lap, and he kept bouncing me on his leg, and then got really handsy, keep in mind i was in primary school, i remember because i hadn‚Äôt started wearing bras again, and it was at that weird pre-teen phase (around 11-12) and he put his hands under my shirt and up, all over my chest.\n\nI still till this day don‚Äôt know if this was ‚Äúnormal‚Äù grandpa behaviour, because i never told anyone until i was 16 and had a breakdown that ended me in hospital, where my mum told me it was a ‚Äúgenerational‚Äù thing and that elderly men just do that. It was never like that for my older sister or brother. Just me. I have never talked to any therapist because it felt like snitching and even till this day i feel like i may be overreacting. The worst part is however, is they had their own key cut for the house (i still live with my parents), every time he‚Äôs over i feel wildly uncomfortable and just hide out in my room. do you think this is a normal experience ?

At this point in my life i hadn't had sex fully because one time i tried it failed to penatrate due to vaginismus which i now know was from SA/Rape as a child that i didn't know at the time. So for all intents and purposes i was still a virgin to my knowledge. \n\n>!Now, i get into the ultrasound room to see a male doctor, there was a female nursing student in the room aswell to chaperone. I had no issues with this until he started to do the test and put the probe in, i stop him and explain how painful it is but he just huffs and explains that if i want answers then we need to do this test. (There was no answers btw). He attempts to force the probe in saying i just need to relax but still the same severe pain and i try to breathe through tears and he doesn't stop the test. I couldn't say anything at this point and i feel sick and in tears. But its feels stupid because he said the test was needed and is huffy about needing time to relax before pushing further. I walk out with the student. I was shocked/crying and not really knowing what the hell just happened.!<\n\nLike i know now why it was so hard with my muscle issue but why continue with a test thats obviously hurting someone. Its not like my pain tolerance is low as i get chronic pain anyway so my baseline is different.\n\nI don't think the nursing student was far enough in her career/too timid to know what to say. \n\nA few years later i explained to a nurse what happened and she said he never should have done that test if i was still a virgin..... i was like so what the actual hell was the need to do that. I felt sick again over the whole thing and now when i have similar tests i can see this in my head. \n\nThen i feel stupid because it was a 'necessary' medical test and it can't be assault right?\n\nSo i'm honestly not sure what to do as its been so so long and i'm not sure it was assault. I'm going to try and discuss this to my therapist when i next see her. \n\nI could likely get the name of the person who did the test if needed but i just don't know, am i being too sensative despite normally having a high pain tolerance. Am i making a bigger deal of it than it is due to previous trauma? \n\nSorry for the seriousness of this. ",

    "selftext": "TW: mentions of various abuse, self-harm/suicide attempts.\n\nLong story...very long story, and probably not one I'll bother boring anyone with, but basically, the past few years have been hard, mentally and emotionally speaking. Now, it's to the point where it's affecting my health. Sleep paralysis, blood coming from my nose, migraines, nausea...you name it.  \nAnyway, for about 2 yrs now I've been pouring my heart and soul into a novel with the intent of helping myself and others heal from trauma and PTSD, or at least to know they're/we're not alone. It's been liberating at points, yes, but also ridiculously suffocating and...just...too real. It's sci-fi, and I love the genre, but it's just too damn real. My emotions are already a jumbled mess, so this project is kind of added stress even though I know I'd be failing to quit it altogether. I just need to push through harder, ig, but it's FRUSTRATING when I feel so alone with it.  \nLike, I have some people who cheer me on from the surface, but there's still a huge disconnect, or so it feels. Then there are others who've ghosted me about it. Still, more who have gaslit me about it. Been judged bc of how controversial and NOT like a lot of present media is regarding certain topics. It's still the first freaking draft! ON BOOK ONE! JUST BOOK ONE! I'm stuck and fuming at this point, even though I technically know what's next.\n\nWhat are the topics?  \nWell....  \nTwo of my three MCs were abused as kids and teenagers--emotionally/mentally, physically, and sexually. Yup. And I went through similar things myself, which owes to a lot of my PTSD.  \nMMC puts up walls and an aggressive front as a coping mechanism (largely what I do), and sometimes gets into self-harm and suicide attempts (I did years ago...) bc of all of the shit he's been through. FMC (friend and eventual gf) understands him and tries to prevent his...attempts in a way that's, well, empathetic and non-judging. Meanwhile, she's dealing with her own shit bc her primary abuser is back in town and working for the villain. She opens up to MMC about what happened to her, and it pisses him off badly for her sake.  \nYeah, and the MMC also grew up surrounded by a cannibalistic, satanistic (not in name, per se, but lots of similar practices) cult that treated love like a taboo and all sorts of twisted bullshit. Hard stuff.  \nAnyway, this makes the project...close to home, and...controversial.\n\nDuring some research, out of curiosity I looked at how various books on the market dealt with stuff like SA. At \"best,\" (not really good, tbh) it was glossed over or flat out ignored. At worst, it was ROMANTICIZED. Like, 9 times out of 10. I found out about Haunting Adeline. Straight up disgusting frickery from hell. Like, WHAT THE HELL IS THAT STORY? WHO COULD WRITE SUCH EXPLOITATIVE AND FILTHY GARBAGE THAT IS A DIRECT AFFRONT TO ANY SA SURVIVOR? Object rape with a gun. Are you kidding me? Full-on rape for literal dozens and dozens of pages straight. Shit like this \\*supposed\\* \"good and hot guy\" saying, \"your body reacted. You want this.\" Straight from the fucking rapist's handbook of lies!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  \nAnd, as if that wasn't bad enough, a side character, also supposedly good and the MC's best friend, CONDONED OBVIOUS RAPE! WTF? THEN...THEN...SOMEHOW, the MC FALLS IN \"LOVE\" WITH THE DIPSHIT? Okay, I know there are twisted accounts of people feeling confused and having feelings, but seriously? Not like that, folks. And it SURE as hell isn't love. Love does not damage someone else's boundaries or take advantage of them.  \nAnyway, after seeing such things, you might say it bolstered my drive for writing my own story. To do JUSTICE to things, or at the very least to the best of my capabilities.\n\nNow, I'm a survivor, yes, but have had zero relationship experience in the sense of trying to navigate...things in light of it to a healing/feeling safe(ish) point. So, in order to do it right for my characters who are, I reach out in effort to get opinions from survivors who've had relationships after such abuse. Many have been quite supportive, BUT...  \nI still feel alone, honestly, bc...well, I go to a different subreddit to get advice for this and I got downvoted to pieces. Like, what gives?????? I pour my LITERAL blood, sweat, and tears into this book and that's the reaction I get? Why??? I'm trying to help my own tribe here, in whatever small way. I'm pretty sure I explained things in a very sensitive and respectful way too, with the exception of slamming that damn Adeline book in order to show that I'm writing DIFFERENT from it. I mean, I get it, I knew my WIP would be super niche from the start--that's okay. What's NOT okay is feeling constantly judged, ignored, or outright battered for it when I'm already struggling enough as is just to get it onto the freaking page.  \n\"Your main character is a temper tantrum throwing maniac and a spineless wimp.\" Dude, he's been through hell and back. He has his issues, yes, but that's seriously a slight to PTSD as a whole, and he's more resilient than a lot of folks in spite of it.  \n\"His reasons for self-harm are stupid.\" Seriously? In what way? He's had his mother figure crucified in front of him, had a close friend betray him and sell him into slavery at which point he was trafficked and used as a sex toy, gaslit, beaten, branded, and loads of other shit.  \n\"His relationship with the FMC is repulsive.\" What? Why? In my and a lot of other opinions I've managed to scrape up, it's beautiful and tender.  \n\"He should honestly die.\" UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURGH.  \n\"This project was a shitstorm from the start and I've no confidence in it at all moving forward.\" \\*angry emoji\\*  \nThat's just a sample of the negative feedback I've gotten.\n\nFurthermore, I'm having other issues. Possibly projection ones. I've started to question myself (my characters question themselves too about the same literal thing), \"are they even allowed the intimacy they get later?\" Reason tells me, \"YES, OF COURSE!\" etc. But like, idk how to explain it. Some of you probably get what I'm saying. Like, \"okay, how is it possible for something meant to be safe and beautiful to be that after it's been so damn mangled, tainted, and butchered?\" And then there's questions like, \"Sexuality is gross.\"  \nYeah, my characters are sex-repulsed like me, but the thing is...I WANT them to be able to share intimacy with each other without feeling so bad about it. (Context, they wait to have sex until they feel ready enough for it and it happens slow with questions and reassurances and breaks throughout the, uh, process.)  \nI want them to have their babies. I want them to have that kind of happiness (even though they'll be happy apart from it bc, let's face it, there's WAY more to life than just sex).\n\nI don't give a rat's ass if I don't get that. Truly. I \\*\\*\\*prefer/want\\*\\*\\* to stay single, and I'm possibly asexual. But the...subject is nonetheless tainted for me too.\n\nAnyway, I don't even know what to do at this point. Maybe this was a stupid and painful-only endeavor after all.... :(\n\nSorry if I sound so mad. My PTSD is also getting pressed by other things....\n\nOnly thing keeping me from blowing up even more rn is listening to Stand My Ground by Within Temptation on loop....",

And it was a point  where I was struggling with him and (I tripped alittle ) and when he so me tripped‚Äîhe tried to force me down on the bench and he did. (BUT I THINK HE HEARD SOMEONE IN THE AREA.) Because  he let me go and grabbed my bag that had my personal stuff in it. Like my: Birth certificate, Ssn, and medical Card in the bag. So I followed him to get my stuff. And he went in a darker area. And when I caught up with him I saw him sitting down on the bench. (The darker area bench.) And i was in a standing  scared position. And he basically said ‚Äúwhy u acting like that.‚Äù---(basically  making me feel like I was overthinking the whole situation. ) so I tried to play it off and at like I was not scared.

    "selftext": "I lost my younger brother when he was only 30 in 2016. Two years later I had the ptsd diagnosis while in the hospital. I tried to see a couple of therapists but I really hated it. I hated sitting there and reliving the whole thing and even worse, feeling like the therapist wasn't even listening to me. I kinda just gave up.\n\nThis really took over my life and contributed to my divorce. My ex would always tell me I needed to go back into therapy or he would be done. Whenever I would hear this from him or feel like he was angry with me, I just shut down. Sometimes I wonder if he thought I didn't care but that wasn't the case at all. I just got to such a low point that I was convinced I was a burden.\n\nI won't have insurance for much longer now that the divorce is almost complete so I'm seeing a therapist while I can. She seems to be more knowledgeable than any of the therapists I had in the past. \n\nShe told me that more recent research shows the traditional methods of treatment just weren't effective. She described how trauma is an automatic nervous response and we can't control it. It can also exacerbate other issues like my ADHD, which explains a lot in itself. \n\nShe described a technique we are starting next week called trauma tapping. The gist is that trauma is activated on one side of the brain. This technique activates the amygdala and gets the other side of the brain to react so that we still have the ability of logical thought when we are exposed to a trigger. By having both sides of the brain activated instead of the side that handles trauma, we are better able to regulate ourselves and not go into a panic attack.\n\nI've gone through the past few years believing I must be a terrible person because I can't get help. But I REALLY didn't want to see a new therapist and tell my story all over again. With this lady I haven't had to do that at all. She says research shows the old method of having patients describe the trauma in detail has turned out to actually be horrible, not helpful. \n\nHearing this almost kind of woke me up. \"Wait so I'm not a complete dirtbag incapable of caring? It was always a nervous system response beyond my control?\" For once in a long time I'm actually eager for our session so I can see if I get results. I blame myself for contributing so much to my divorce, but now I feel like it was something I was never going to get control of until meeting the right therapist. I mean, the last therapist I had would do phone calls and I could hear him driving around while talking to me. Therapy doesn't seem like the time to have divided attention. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\nAnyone else try this technique? Sorry idk if this is a rant or a post looking for advice.

    "selftext": "I should start this by saying I'm not diagnosed with PTSD, but I do have a lot of trauma to work through. It affects my daily life so much that I'm often isolating myself in a dark room, because it is the only time I feel safe. I'm safest when there are no people around me.\n\nI get the anxiety attacks, the panic attacks, the restless nights and appetite changes. I use substances. I don't take care of myself and don't eat enough. I have lost a lot of weight. The worst part is trying to socialize or being in a public place, such as my work, because I'm so overly cautious, quiet, and clumsy. There's a man whose face I can't look at, not even for a second, because his face looks so much like the person that gave me this trauma... \n\nAnyway, I have this really bad habit of pretending to be perfectly fine. I try to smile at people, although not so much now, since they don't like me anymore. These are people I see five days a week. They talk badly about me. I don't handle rejection well, so I break down and cry in a dark room or I keep doing my job, but I mentally space out and just go through the motions. It's a cleaning job, so I keep cleaning but get lost in my head. I have stopped looking at these people and talking to them, but they now talk about me more. I pretend not to hear it.\n\nUnfortunately it's a very social job, and that's the thing I cannot do. I panic when I have to talk to somebody. They could ask, \"Hey, how are you?\" My response is *always* \"Good, how are you?\" It's automatic and it feels robotic, like I'm not human or something. \n\nI've done this for so long. It's how I survive the day, by simply smiling and saying I'm good. I don't know how to stop.\n\nMaybe it doesn't help that this workplace isn't healthy for me. I had just started this job, not even three months in, when a trauma happened. It involved a coworker, and people talk about it but they don't know *anything.* They treat it as some little mishap, maybe a bit of an inappropriate interaction. It's no big deal to them and it happened \"so long ago.\" Hearing stuff like that pisses me off, because it wasn't some minor thing. A coworker took advantage of me, fully. \n\nIt's so hard to just say the words. I've gone back to avoiding my problems, whisking them into my mind while I force a smile. The place I work in now is the same as when I was traumatized. So I already know, I can't heal in this environment. Worse than that, nobody knows what happened to me so nobody understands my trauma responses. They think I'm weird, or stupid, or they avoid me. I was hurt and I have FOUGHT to be where I am now, only to hear daily smack talk about me, and not a single person there understands. One guy even wears a SI prevention jacket and still doesn't get it... he talks the most crap. \n\nI'm so tired of fighting. Every day is a fight. I'm not eating, sleeping, and I always want to SH. I'm making myself ill. And nobody checks on me either, because I have mastered how to pretend I'm fine. They don't know that I still have flashbacks. I still panic. I fear it happening again, all of the time. Like someone is going to pretend to be a friend just to take advantage, like he did. I trust nobody. How much longer can I do this?\n\nOh, and I'm in therapy, but I don't fully talk to my therapist about this. I'm too ashamed, so I pretend to be better, when I'm actually so much worse. I'm just tougher now. I don't let it show when I'm hurting, and I put on a smile. Even when I see him, hear him, feel him. Nobody knows, nor would they care. It's been three long years.\n\nI know there's a simple answer here, to quit my job and never see those people again. I already did once. I quit for six months and was unemployed for that time. Then I came back. I thought I was ready to go back, but I wasn't fully healed and I have screwed everything up. At this point I've considered outright telling people, but that is a terrible idea. People can't know. I just wish they understood I am struggling, and yet I continue to pretend to be fine. Even though they know I'm not. They think I'm hung up on a guy or something. \n\nI'm sorry for the rant.",

I feel the need to share the things I went through because I haven't really talked about it to anyone and hoping that maybe it can provide some relief because I don't feel comfortable sharing with those around me. Preface when I started this relationship I was 22 years old and he was 28. We grew up together as his parents were basically family to me and his sisters were my best friend. I always had a little crush on him growing up but was really insecure when I entered the relationship. Since then I've worked a lot on myself but consider myself to be asexual because of trauma response I have developed since our relationship.\n\nThese are the things that I experience from my PTSD that pop into my head. PTSD is strange in that random things can trigger it and you have no control of the memory (Sorry about any typos, this was initially a note I made for myself because writing is something I use to help me process things):\n\n* The comments he made about my dad and mom (about them having sex) that were completely inappropriate and the amount of times that he had made them despite expressing how uncomfortable it made you just for him to constantly do it. It got to an excessive point where it became something we constantly fought about and always resulted in him calling me uptight.\n* The time I had sex with him at my sisters because he wouldn‚Äôt leave me alone even though I asked him not to because I was with family and then how he weaponised it against me later because said I said no to sex initially but then had sec regardless. His reasoning for forcing me other times was because he no longer believed I was telling the truth when I said no.\n* The time that I had literally just told him that I had been sexually assaulted just for him to grab me by the neck to the point I couldn‚Äôt breathe and I nearly let him get away with it but then drove him home. Where on the whole ride home he blamed it on me and the fact that I was goth and how he misinterpreted the situation despite the several conversations of the fear of sex that I had with him before entering the relationship.¬†\n* The many time that he would make me suck his d\\*\\*\\* or else he would get mad or just in the middle of sex would just shove his d\\*\\*\\* in my mouth when lying down and then force it to the back of the throat till I was crying or about to throw up.\n* The time that he got out of the car because someone was being a jerk and cut you off because he was a ‚Äúmanly man‚Äù despite that I asked him not to and just the fact that it was literally insane.¬†\n* His complete fascination with guns and how he talked about wanting kill someone.\n* The times that he begged me to take a shower with him every single day while house sitting for my parent and would just force me into sex or guilt trip me just because I was just flirting with him (not in a sexual way either but just because I was trying to be a good girlfriend) or because he did something nice for me.\n* How he used my openness to trying new things and having fun during sex as a way to guilt trip me for being a slut.\n* Forcing me to be on the phone with him every minute I wasn‚Äôt in school and how I let that affect my grades.\n* Driving in my home city after we broke up and maybe seeing him behind me in his new car and having a full on panic attack and the realisation that I could never step foot in his families house ever again\n* How he told everyone that I cheated on him and my friends and family believed him over me¬†\n* When he told me that he would fuck his biological sister if he could¬†\n* How he never made an effort or had any interest in anything I actually did besides that I was smart¬†\n* The fact that he said he wishes that his niece was abused the same way he was because he thought it would be good discipline for her because she didn‚Äôt say I love you too when he dropped her off for school\n* The fear that I felt every time he would get angry from the pacing and punching that he would do making me feel unsafe in those situations\n* The literal lunacy that was him telling lies about his therapist sexually assaulting him but when offering help how he stated he only wanted to see her because she was a good therapist and yelling at the planes that flew over the day that I broke up with him.¬†\n* The genuine fear I have to this day to come across him ever again¬†\n* The disappointment, disgust and shame I feel for letting someone do all these things to me because of the insecurity I felt about myself and how that lead to so much more trauma in my life and the way that people treat me when I let them in to anything that happened during the relationship making it clear that this is not something I can talk about to anyone in my life",

    "title": "Not knowing what to expect is a trigger for me (TW for abuse)",
    "selftext": "In working with my therapist, I've recently realized a commonality between a lot of the events that send me into tailspins and activate my fight-or-flight. Very often, the theme is that I don't know what to expect from an interaction with an individual, so my nervous system goes \"harm imminent; must prepare\". \n\n  \nUsually, this comes out in instances where I'm dealing with interpersonal issues and the other person doesn't respond. Like, if I say something like \"hey, there appears to be an issue between us consisting of XYZ; how can we address this and come to a resolution?\" and they don't say anything in response, there is something so deeply, deeply embedded in my psyche that takes that to mean that they are readying to harm me. It's the calm before the storm, so to speak. This originates from trauma with my dad, who used to always go completely silent right before he'd >!pull out his gun !<or  >!beat the hell out of me!<. And it was always immediately following instances where I tried to advocate for myself or bring up an issue. I had a different abuser, too, who would always go completely silent before doing something awful, so that, for me, is just always there in those prolonged silences. They are terrifying, even if there is no solid reason for them to be at this point.\n\n  \nI know I can't *make* people talk to me, and I don't want to be disrespectful of anyone or their boundaries. But especially when I'm bringing up conflict or an issue with someone, I am always so afraid that they're gonna harm me when they just say nothing and stonewall (and I will call it stonewalling, since I express myself clearly, ask for a response/clarity, and am able to see that they read those messages), such that these interactions - or lack thereof - *become* traumatic, themselves. My nervous system is waiting for the blow to come, waiting to fight or run, and living in that space around these kinds of people is incredibly stressful. Please, I do not care how impolite you are in addressing me; I do not care if you dislike me or if you have some grade-A smack to talk about me. Cuss me out, yell at me, tell me you hate me with every fiber of your being, but please say *something*. \n\n  \nMainly, it's a situation at work/school with a colleague. I have gotten the sense since I met this person that they have just outright hated me from the start. I have tried to build a rapport with them, tried to establish some kind of connection there so that I can work with them without issue, but their cold body language/tone/facial expressions/passive aggressive little comments/scoffing/eye rolling/judgmental remarks have all persisted. I do not trust them at all because I find them incredibly unpredictable. Once in a blue moon, they'll act like we're besties and wave at me or like a bunch of my social media posts, all the while ignoring the actual attempts to address this issue. And having to work with them, as I have in the past, has led me to completely shut down and go nonverbal in their presence. I have always left those interactions early, without fail. I've brought this up multiple times, thinking *ok, maybe they just aren't aware they're coming off this way and it's all a big misunderstanding.* They've not responded to any of those attempts to address it, so I'm just increasingly distressed even being in the same room as them because I don't know what to expect. The not knowing what to expect has me in this constant state of fight-or-flight near them, so I've been avoiding them. Unfortunately, this also means avoiding many of the spaces and communities I otherwise would have loved to be part of and connected to, but I don't feel like I can safely be in those environments because all my brain can focus on is *where are they, where are the exits to this place, do not get near me, what will I do if \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_* and that's exhausting; I no longer derive any joy from those communities or experiences because my body won't stop acting like there's a predator afoot.\n\n  \nMaybe they are totally harmless and it *is* all a big misunderstanding. But I wish they'd communicate that and not leave me to guess - because my guess will always be \"they are going to harm me\" since that is the background I have to draw on. I understand I am not owed this communication and they are not responsible for my nervous system's responses to them, but I will still continue to be terrified around them and avoid any instances where they might be till I know I am not in danger. Unfortunately, that means not going to a lot of things, which is becoming isolating. \n\n  \nI'm not sure how to tackle this. Thoughts?",

    "selftext": "Life has been hell for me these past few years ever since I started noticing and picking up the mental and physical abuse I endure home during the eighth grade life just been going downhill getting worse year by year and day by day.  Just being mentally and physically abused it took a toll on me and I had no idea at all. I had no one to talk to at all and I just tried to shift my focus by fitting in school. That just made shit even more worse.\n\nI just dealt with the same neglect and embarrassment and shame as I did at home. And I‚Äôve been having constant unwanted flashbacks of the trauma in eighth grade. I was ashamed of who I was as a person so I acted differently than who I was to have people I could rely on to forget about the abuse. I fucked up badly. I was just making shit worse for myself and now I‚Äôm ashamed of how I acted to forget about the abuse at home. I‚Äôm incredibly ashamed about this but this one time I joked around with my friend saying fatty patty at first he laughed but when I said it again he said he was gonna smack my mouth. I never meant any harm at all. I had no support during this time and I was dealing with so much abuse I did anything to make friends. This other time, back then I used to act tough to Impreza people because I cared what people thought about me because I was Ahmed of who I was and a person because of the abuse and this one time I joked around with someone who I thought was my friend and was like fuck you up. I meant no harm but I was an idiot but he was with his actual friend and he yells  stfu at me. I was traumatically embarrassed. It reminded me of all the belittling and yelling and constant neglect I was receiving at home for no reason. I meant no harm all I just wanted to have friends to forget about the abuse but all I received back was the same treatment I was getting at home and it just made my mental health even more worse and I feel ashamed  as a  person for making those mistakes of fitting in to forget about the abuse at home.I feel like I‚Äôm the problem.\n\n\nMy mental health got even more fucked up as years go by. I‚Äôm not even the same anymore. I can‚Äôt focus at all I barely eat I could barely even function and been dealing with anxiety and depression since freshman year because of all the abuse. Now I‚Äôm failing school because of all the stress and just the motivation and focus it‚Äôs all gone. I could barely even focus in school because I‚Äôm always on edge. I always think something bad will happen and I‚Äôm always worrying. Ever since freshman year I‚Äôve been having constant unwanted traumatic memories and flashbacks about past and ongoing home and school trauma roan in my head which gives me significant distress. My heart and chest gets this weird feeling to the point where I could barely even breathe. This is an everything thing and it just won‚Äôt stop. And all this is happening while I have to go to school. I barely even do anything because I just can‚Äôt focus and I lost all my love for school because of all the abuse and trauma I‚Äôve endured at home and school. Everything around me triggers these traumatic memories and the people I have to look at and see everyday triggers them.\n\n\nA lot of people contributed to the trauma and abuse but for the mental and physical abuse it‚Äôs from my grandmother and aunt. My grandmothers boyfriend also played a huge role to the domestic violence and abuse which is why I chose to not say anything to him and just not be around him. I‚Äôm currently failing school because I just can‚Äôt function at all and anxiety and depression hit me badly. Every single day my grandmother gets these messages of me coming to school late and just antagonizes me about it. The more she does that the more I feel less about myself. Now, she has gotten messages of me failing my classes and now trying to ask me why am I failing what‚Äôs going on with me like she‚Äôs not enduring me in all this abuse and being constantly hostile and disrespectful with me for no fuckjng reason. They expect me to be good in school but they‚Äôre enduring me in all this abuse. I barely even feel safe here.\n\n\n\nEspecially if it‚Äôs just my aunt and me. She has this thing where because of one small situation goes on a rampage and goes crazy in the house attacking me throwing stuff banging stuff just going crazy. And they‚Äôre confused why I‚Äôm failing school. This specific situation with my grandmothers boyfriend that really just urkes me because it makes me realize I‚Äôve been abused and taken advantage of so fucking much and I just acted like it was nothing because I was too scared to talk to anybody about the abuse and I tried to act like it‚Äôs nothing even though it‚Äôs a very big deal . But freshman year my grandmother with her usual antics and started antagonizing me and she asked me about a slip and I didn‚Äôt know what she was talking about so I asked to clarify and all of a sudden her boyfriend pressed me and started to threaten me saying he don‚Äôt care if the cops come and slammed the door on me. Next morning I‚Äôm the dark he woke me up in a fucking military suit and forced me against my will to do all these exercises and drills like I‚Äôm on beyond scared straight. I was incredibly traumatized. All this abuse really affected me and it‚Äôs all coming to haunt me now and it‚Äôs the fact that the mental and physical abuse is still continuing. I really be thinking there‚Äôs something wrong with me to be enduring In all this abuse.",

My self esteem was destroyed and I basically threw everything about me away so I could be an empty, depressed shell and fit in with the rest of the sheep. \n\n(US public schools are extremely ableist. It's like you're a square being shoved through a circular hole by force, and if you don't like it then you get punished and diagnosed with Oppositional Defiant Disorder. Special Ed here is a fucking joke.)\n\nWhen I was a kid I used to really be into art, I loved drawing and I even used to win 1st place in contests sometimes. But ever since then, I was always made to feel like nothing I ever did was right or good enough and that I was forever destined to be the black sheep that didn't deserve to be happy or at peace with themselves.\n\nSo I completely gave up drawing and stopped practicing for years. Not being in school anymore as an adult didn't change that mentality.\n\nI could've been so good by now, but instead I'm starting over from scratch and I still have so much internalized hate and shame for myself that I can't even finish a basic sketch before immediately giving up and \"saving it for later\"....I've never had a sketch book that wasn't just wasted paper.\n\nIf I'm not good at something right away then that ends up being a reflection of me, even though I know I shouldn't be feeling that way or expecting to be perfect on my 1st try. I'm still not used to not being \"gifted\" anymore.\n\nGaming was my escapism for a while, but creative life sim genres are my favorite (ACNH, Minecraft, anything that gives you a lot of creative freedom to express yourself), which also sends me down the social media rabbit hole of comparing my work to others and impulsively deleting my save files. Taking a break and switching to other types of games doesn't help.\n\nI could play a game for years, have countless hours built up on my switch, and not have a single save to show for it. \n\nNow I'm stuck in a horrible cycle of slowly killing myself with dopamine (smoking weed, binge eating, watching brain rot to avoid thinking, phone scrolling, bedrotting) to procrastinate my greatest fear (happily expressing myself in a safe, creative environment with no one around to judge or make fun of me for it).\n\nIt doesn't make sense for me to avoid something I've always wanted, but the main issue besides the shame is just straight up not knowing who I am anymore since I turned myself into a blank slate and shut my brain off. Being blank isn't an empowering opportunity for redemption to me.\n\nWhat if I finally managed to build the perfect virtual world or finish the best art project ever, just for it to still not feel \"right\" or \"me\"? What if nothing ever brings me happiness or closure and I'm stuck self loathing forever?? I also have extreme commitment issues from being forced to move all the time.\n\nNo matter how hard I try to redeem myself and succeed in life in other aspects, my creative \"purpose\" still proves to be the bane of my existence. Sometimes I wish I could have a free trial of death (not just closing my eyes to sleep) and see if that would be truly worse than living like this...",

    "selftext": "this is a pretty long and rambly post about feeling guilt, shame, and embarrassment about my PTSD.\n\nso every night before bed I do my \"PTSD check\" which is what I've begun to call (in my head) the thing I do where I going around the house making sure the doors are locked.\n\nwell tonight my mom woke up for the morning as I was about to go to bed and she caught me checking the front door (the last one I check before bed as it's the closest one to my bedroom). it was dark as I had already turned the lights off so I couldn't see her, but I heard her quietly call my name as to not wake anyone up. it scared the shit out of me. I haven't felt that scared for my life in a while; like genuine \"oh fuck!\" fear. I turned around and just stared across the room but it was too dark to see her. she called my name again and I said \"hello?\" while trying not to panic more than I already was. I could barely make out her body coming through the darkness. it wasn't till I could see her face that the fear fully eased. turns out she just wanted a hug before I went to bed. \n\nI felt a pretty intense need to explain what I was doing but I was overcome with shame and embarrassment. no one knows I do that every night. it's been my little secret. my shameful act of patheticness that I do every single night despite the fact that I know logically I am safe and don't need to worry so much anymore. it's my delusional anxious bullshit. my guilt to carry. yet she saw me do it. \n\nor at least I think she did. it might have been too dark for how to make out what I was doing. luckily she didn't see me stare out of the window for a few seconds \"just to make sure\" like I did just before I made sure the door was locked, which is when she called my name. but I didn't realize till writing this post that she might have just thought I was locking the door before bed, which is at least a somewhat normal behavior I think. oh well.\n\nI hate how much shame, guilt, and embarrassment I feel about my PTSD. I feel like no one believes me; like I'm just making it up or massively exaggerating. when I do tell someone I have PTSD I almost always mention that it's diagnosed so they won't think I'm being dramatic; despite the fact that I firmly believe that self diagnosis is valid. maybe it's just not valid for me? maybe it'd only be \"being dramatic\" if it were me? why do I have so much guilt and self hatred because *I was abused?* what sense does that even make? how did I get here..?\n\n.\n\n***edit/update (kind of):***\nI want to thank everyone for sending me so many nice messages and helping me see this from an outsiders perspective.\n\nI'm sorry I'm taking so long to reply to everyone! this is a very hard subject for me to talk about so I've only been able to reply to a couple comments every few days. I promise I will get to yours tho, I'll read them all, don't worry! all the ones I have read and replied to have been very helpful and supportive and I'm sure the rest are too. thank you again and I'm sorry again for taking so long.",

I didn't think I needed it, because I will just go into situations even if a bit uncomfortable, it was never a big deal. I realize now that that is because I was dissociating and now, everything is unravelling in my life where I don't feel comfortable doing anything where everything has some level of more intense discomfort. \n\nI was the one to check out new places, interact with people, talk to the waitress or the cashier, just make a phone call to a place, go dance on the street to music with others. Addressing some issues with avoiding work related spaces and now I have realized I was dissociating through it all my whole life. It feels like everything is beginning to unravel in my life and that I am trudging through mud that keeps rising higher and higher. \n\nI'm now reluctant to leave my house, I'm reluctant to interact with anyone besides one person in my life. I don't want to interact, or be perceived. \n\nExposure therapy work is now me actively trying to be mindful and ground myself back while then battling the slew of negative emotions and thoughts that send me into ungrounded states. I am EXHAUSTED. Life goes on so I still need to go out and do certain things but now that I am aware of how I have been interacting with the world this whole time, I feel even more alienated and strange. \n\nMy anxiety and depression is still low overall, coming up situationaly to reasonable triggers. I still do things around the house. Most medications end up having side effects that worsen the dissociation by further emotional numbing. I'm contraindicated for anything that effects heart rate including things slowing rate heart. \n\nNot sure what to do or where to go from here. When I talk about all this I tend to hear \"this is beyond my scope\" and the like, or \"what you are feeling is normal, our society is sick.\" The latter is great and all, but where do I go from here?

Potentially   youngest i was was 6? \n\nSo i remember a particular pair of pink pjama bottoms, the top had a white front bit and pink long arms. I feel sick remembering them honestly, like theres a pit in my stomach. I remember a feeling of fingers touching in these PJ bottoms and the pants themselves having been moved around/twisted when i woke up later.

I remember feeling like i had to keep it a secret. I think i only know a vague age because i remember these pjs have ages 6-7 on them ive no idea why that detail i remember or even if any of this is true. I mean i could have just been exploring myself right? But the whole things feels wrong and is stuck in the back of my brain and i can't get it out. \n\nCould this have actually happened? \n\nI always used to have dreams of people coming for me, breaking down doors and coming to take me away. But this could just be normal childhood nightmares. Theres one specific one when i remember an adult but they were a monster and had these long claws and they clawed through the toilet door which is where i would always hide when upset and lock myself in. \n\nI don't know if i just had an over active imagination. I don't know what i want with this post i'm just wondering if im making things out to be worse than they are, likely nothing happened. ",

    "title": "Traumatic Stress",
    "selftext": "# Sexual abuse is a horrific and traumatic experience that can have long-lasting effects on a survivor's life. One of the most common outcomes of sexual abuse is Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), a mental health condition that can develop after a person has been exposed to a traumatic event or series of events. PTSD can have a significant impact on a survivor's daily life, relationships, and overall well-being.Individuals who have experienced sexual abuse may struggle with intrusive thoughts, memories, and flashbacks of the traumatic event. These symptoms can be triggered by various stimuli, such as physical touch, certain smells, or situations that remind the survivor of the abuse. As a result, survivors may experience heightened levels of anxiety, fear, and distress, making it difficult for them to feel safe and secure in their [surroundings.In](http://surroundings.In) addition to intrusive thoughts and memories, survivors of sexual abuse may also experience emotional numbness, avoidance behaviors, and hypervigilance. Emotional numbness can manifest as a disconnection from one's emotions and difficulty expressing feelings or forming attachments with others. Avoidance behaviors may involve avoiding certain places, people, or activities that remind the survivor of the abuse. Hypervigilance is a state of increased arousal and alertness, where the survivor is constantly on edge and scanning their environment for potential threats. Furthermore, sexual abuse can impact a survivor's relationships with others, including family members, friends, and romantic partners. Survivors may struggle with trust issues, intimacy challenges, and difficulties in forming and maintaining healthy relationships. They may also experience feelings of shame, guilt, and self-blame, which can contribute to a sense of isolation and loneliness.It is important for survivors of sexual abuse to seek help and support from mental health professionals, such as therapists, counselors, and support groups. Therapy can help survivors process their trauma, develop coping strategies, and learn how to manage their symptoms of PTSD. Medication may also be prescribed to help manage symptoms of anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbances.In conclusion, sexual abuse can have a profound impact on a survivor's life, leading to symptoms of PTSD and other mental health challenges. It is crucial for survivors to seek help and support in order to heal from their trauma and regain a sense of safety and well-being. With proper treatment and support, survivors can learn to cope with their symptoms and move forward in their recovery journey.¬†[¬†](https://www.my-story.vip/)",

She was SAed when she was maybe 7, but raised by a loving family, then beaten by her wife and eventually nearly killed by her wife stabbing her with a knife and lost her child to the court system. I was abused both emotionally and physically as a child,  there were a few times the abuse could have killed me as a child, I was SHed as a teenager, and SAed as a barely adult (first time was at 18, 2nd was last year at 27), but what really set off my ptsd was one intense incident of plain old harassment (not sexual or physical) so that's all I would tell a new therapist when I first saw them and got brushed off so many times that it took me 6 years to get a ptsd diagnosis. My condition was also made worse by emotional abuse that continued into adulthood. I  still feel like she's kinda right, I was never stabbed or really attacked with anything that would traditionally be called a 'weapon' and I was never physically abused BY MY LIFE PARTNER, or SAed AS A CHILD, and I certainly don't know anything about what it's like to loose a child in any way, I don't have one. The fact that I still have ptsd and she doesn't makes me feel really pathetic too.

As far as I‚Äôm aware my brother is okay and that friend‚Äôs partner is at least at a distance from them but my brother still checks the abuser‚Äôs twitter frequently to make sure he‚Äòs not doing anything crazy or planning anything, since he used to harass my brother and his other unrelated friends too.

    "title": "Why did it take 8 months for things to get bad enough to be considered PTSD? Is this normal? How do I tell the people close to me?",
    "selftext": "I was in an abusive relationship for 2 years and got out a little less than a year ago. I didn't feel too terrible afterwards, I didn't really feel traumatized, I was pretty indifferent. I had mentally checked out of that relationship 6 months before it ended but he basically wouldn't let me break up with him. I would have the occasional nightmare or flashback, but I was able to kinda push it out of my mind. I mean I do have triggers, but I just avoided those. I've been in therapy this whole time and I've been trying to avoid the topic. I would avoid it when I was still with him because I thought it was my own problem and I was also embarrassed. After the fact, I just felt like not talking about it and trying to forget would be best. Well, I have been having flashbacks and nightmares every few days for the past month, and have been extremely paranoid and anxious and its been getting worse and worse. She told me I probably have PTSD but I don't understand how. I thought time heals all wounds, so why is it now getting bad? She told me I need to talk it over but the idea of that is scary, I've been stressing about it since our last session. I don't know if I can talk about it like that. I'd rather not tell anyone how it was. \n\nI was kinda dumb and started dating again pretty soon after. I met my now boyfriend about a month or so after I was finally able to break things off fully (we were no contact for a month prior to me finally being able to end it). Me and him clicked instantly and became really good friends, then started dating. He's a wonderful and kind man. I wish I knew that I would be as affected by it as I am. I genuinely thought I was fine and processed everything while still in the relationship and in the month of no contact/month after. \n\nBut now I'm dealing with this. I'm sure he's noticed I've been a bit off these past few weeks, but how do I tell him \"hey I'm sorry but I actually have PTSD\" and have him understand? He knows my ex was abusive but I don't think he realizes how bad it was and how bad it apparently affected me. I'm afraid he will get upset and tell me I shouldn't have started dating if I have this. I cant stress it enough, I really had no idea that I was as affected as I was and I wouldn't have purposely dragged someone into a situation like this. The last thing i want to do is mess things up with him. I can't just uproot my whole life since things are getting bad, that will probably make things so much worse. I'm doing all I can to make sure that I don't hurt my boyfriend. I keep reminding myself that he is not my ex. He doesn't think like him, he doesn't act like him, he doesn't look like him. I know I'm safe with him, he has shown me time and time again that he is trustworthy and has a kind heart, so I don't know why I'm still afraid of him. \n\nIts weird because I do trust him for the most part. My body doesn't though. Like I could want him to do something or he could do something that in theory- I'd enjoy, but are a trigger. My body just reacts. I just start feeling so trapped and helpless and scared and anxious that I go into my own head and think about all the bad things my ex did. Something as simple as cleaning makes me freak out. My boyfriend loves to clean and I have really bad anxiety around cleaning that only got worse with my ex. Every time he suggests we clean up a little I just get so anxious even though I want to do it. He always tries to make it fun by being silly and playing music but I always end up shutting down. BUT I WANT TO DO IT! I know he isn't going to belittle me or ridicule me, but why do I react as if he already has? He could come in and tell me \"oh wow, good job!\" And ill immediately think that he doesn't mean it and is just making fun of me. HE IS NOT. I don't understand why I'm like this and its so frustrating. He tells me I'm beautiful ALL the time. He has never done anything to make me think or feel otherwise. Part of my brain thinks he's lying. There are some times all I can think about is how ugly I look and that he feels the same way. It happens alot when we're being intimate and its terrible. Its horrible that I don't believe him. I want to belive him, I want to be happy with him without having that little voice in my head telling me these things. I genuinely love this man and I am so angry with myself that I cannot fully believe anything he says. And I know thats on me and it hurts. I've been trying to act normal, I haven't told him that I've been thinking like this. I need to figure it out on my own and its not fair for him to know that. I feel like that's upsetting to hear. \n\nI feel like I'm at war with my brain. I'm constantly shutting down terrible thought after terrible thought. I know that what I'm thinking and feeling is wrong, but I don't know how to stop it. I have never experienced my mind working against me so horribly. I am autistic and have experienced alot of bullying and maltreatment which has left me with trauma, if I ignore that stuff then the anxiety goes away. I have always been self conscious, but nothing like this. I feel like everything is against me. \n\nWhat the fuck do I do? I'm so confused and stressed out. I know I probably should talk about it with my therapist but I don't want to relive that. Ive told her the basics but idk, I just don't want to talk about it. \n\nAlso, how exactly do I talk about this with my boyfriend. I feel like he should atleast know that I'm dealing with this. How do I explain that I have no idea why its only really becoming an issue now? I dont want him to get the impression that I'm hung up on my ex and missing him or some bullshit like that. I mean, I guess I'm still hung up on the fact that I was abused for 2 years and was manipulated to be convinced it was my fault. \n",

I finally got to do an intense trauma therapy which actually helped a lot, and in that euphoria of finally feeling better I decided to just move across the country so I could \"start a new life\" (what an odd thing to think). Since I couldn't afford a own flat i looked for a room in a shared one and actually found some really nice people.

Of course, how naive could I be to even dare to think I could have been cured. I get a lot of flashbacks again which lead me to breaking down, I am incredible depressed, got problems with taking care of my body, and so on. I barely leave the house except for university. The worst part is my enormous paranoia. I am scared of anyone, i can't trust anyone - it's the worst with my flatmates.  I have to listen for a few minutes if there's really no one out of their rooms so i can go to the toilette and so on. I am scared they just hate me at this point and something bad will happen soon, even though i rationally don't think this is true. But maybe they will one day if i keep acting that weird and all over the place. And now that's the thing i want to talk about:\n\nI did not tell them about the severity of my health condition when i applied for this room. I just did not want some strangers to know how bad I was doing - I though it was over! And now I feel so guilty.

I just can't tell them about all those horrible things, not talking about the traumatic experiences itself, but more about how it affects my whole life.\n\nThanks for listening, I would be so happy if anyone could give me some advice.",

Since almost one year, I‚Äôve been able to come down to 50 and since 2-3 months to 25mg. Even though this seems so low, compared to where I‚Äôve been, and with it (25mg) my sleep is awesome, comparing to how it was in the past. But I can‚Äôt get the step off the 25mg, mostly because i just can‚Äôt fall asleep and I take it because I prefer over not being able to fall asleep at all. But I really wanna get rid of it totally, so I just think about not sleeping for 1-2 nights and hoping it will work that way long time. Has anyone made experience with that medication and getting rid of it? Or with the sleeplessness without taking it?",

I have pretty bad sexual trauma (continuous violent rapes for a few years plus an encounter alone with many men watching as I was assaulted by a stranger) and have been to psychosexual therapy. My partner at the time obviously knew all about this and was present for my therapy journey. He told me in detail how he'd had sex with this other woman. I know this may sound absurd but my brain has related this encounter to him having actually raped me. I keep seeing myself in the scenario but it isn't consensual. The physical cheating is just so personal to someone with sexual trauma. Does anyone else relate to this? Any advice?",

    "selftext": "Hello I'm 20 years old, around 6 years ago I lived through a traumatic event that kinda changed me forever, sadly it wasn't the only event of this kind, in total there were 3 violent events that made me think at that moment that I'm going to die or get injured.\n\nI drank alot and smoked w\\*\\*d during my first highschool years because at that time I didn't even know what was wrong with me. It peaked during covid when the second event happened combined with a bad breakup quickly after that (because of my mental issues) at that time I tried to h\\*ng myself and changed my mind last minute before losing conciousness. But that's when my biggest suffering started, the constant pressure of my hypervigilance was and is still driving me crazy. I did alot of physical self-harm back then. Also I only remember fragments of what was actually going on so this is my best take on it. I tried EMDR but the person who did it with me refused to go deeper into my trauma and mostly focused on other childhood stuff. It did help with that but didn't ease my symptoms at all.\n\nIt started getting worse again after I finished highschool and it peaked before and during Christmas of 2024. My parents are divorcing and dad is an alcoholic, I had to physically stop him from killing himself and quickly after that I got cheated on in a starting relationship with a very mentally unstable girl. There was one violent event on New year involving me and my father which made me go completely insane. That's when my psychologist recommended psychiatric treatment. I had to quit Kratom which I was very dependent on for 1.5 years and probably caused alot of issues on it's own.\n\nI was perscribed Zoloft, Pregabalin, Trazodone (for sleep) and recently Quetiapine for night terrors.\n\nDuring the first stage of taking the meds I tried to cope with my PTSD by watching extreme g\\*re. Now I kinda feel like it was more of a self-harm. It's been around 10 months of me taking the medication but I still have big issues with anxiety and hypervigilance. It's hard for me to date someone since I'm constantly scanning my surroundings and fear that they will get hurt or attacked, it's hard for me to find a job because the longer I spend on the way to work the more energy the hypervigilance consumes (I currently do freelancing mostly from home).\n\nWith my medication, really horrible nightmares came, it started slow but now they happen quite frequently, almost everynight. It kills my whole day sometimes and I find it hard to function normally.\n\nWhen I encounter a direct reminder of my PTSD I go haywire and have to fight myself to not be agressive, then I suffer for the rest of the week which includes flashbacks, night terrors and overall a very bad mood. This is also a reason I carry we\\*\\*ons on me (all legally acquired). They actually help me feel a bit better when outside but I know how extreme this solution it is.\n\nI sometimes drink and rarely smoke w\\*\\*d when I go outside with my friends because if I'm not at least a bit drunk I cannot let my guard down and calm down to actually enjoy the time with them. I also smoke when going somewhere which also makes me a bit calmer but still it's just a toxic bandage on a bleeding wound.\n\nThe meds helped me go from completely insane to socially acceptable stability but inside I feel like something is very wrong, almost beyond a point of no return wrong.\n\nPlease if you have any experience or advice write it down, I'm starting to give up again and don't know what to do next. If you have any experience with therapy or just similar diagnosis/experience feel free to share it.\n\n(P.S. English is not my first language).",

    "selftext": "CW: Non-graphic mentions of homicide, murder, gun violence, mass shooting, police.\n\nIn May of 2024, I survived a mass shooting. During this event, I witnessed multiple homicides, including that of the first responding police officer and the shooter. I did not think I would live through this event, but I did.\n\nIn the direct aftermath of this event, my friends and community came together to support me. I could tell everyone really cared about me, and I could also tell that no one had any actual reference point for the level of violence I encountered and the horrible things I witnessed. For them, these things are still unimaginable and still so intangible. It has been both beautiful to see how much my friends care about me, and also very isolating to see how impossible it is for them to understand what happened to me. \n\nThe 20 minutes I spent embroiled in this near death experience changed my life and my view of the world completely. Everyone else is in the same world they were in before. Enough time has passed that for many of my friends, what happened to me has faded from their minds somewhat. But it is still affecting me everyday, and it is painful to hear people close to me talk gleefully about reading a murder mystery, watching a police procedural, playing a gun centered video game, or referencing horrible news items with a cynical humor. Like, for me, murder is not something that is only in entertainment, and giving (retraumatizing) evidence to the police isn't something that only exists in movies, and it never will be again. It is something that I lived through first hand and which is truly, truly awful.. \n\nThis past Monday, I completed a PHP (Partial Hospitalization Program) for my PTSD symptoms from this event. Before going, I was having nightmares, stress vommitting, having intruisive memories and flashbacks multiple times daily. I was able to do the basic things I needed to in order to keep alive-- report to job, do my laundry, cook food, take out trash. But I was not able to do any of the things that make life enjoyable at all. The PHP really helped with my physiological symptoms and I'm grateful for that and how it has expanded my capacity to interact with my life. I am now able to encounter triggers without feeling like the event is happening again. I am able to see a picture of a gun without having a panic attack.\n\n But, the work that I did in the PHP did not alleviate my feelings of isolation and I'm unsure of how to navigate this. The blas√© attitude that people have about the news of mass shootings and gun violence and violence in general, and the callous jokes that people make about violence and murder, and the prominent spot that murder and guns have in entertainment remain very painful for me. I do not see these things changing and I'm unsure of where my place in this world is. With my close friends I feel able to have conversations about this and how it is hard for me. But with coworkers, and etc, I don't feel able to and I don't feel interested in being vulnerable and sharing what I went through. It feels really hard. \n\n  \nWith this post, I'm not even really looking for advice. I just wanted to be able to say it, and hear if other people have the same issue. I don't want to feel alone anymore. If you can help, please help. If not, that is ok. ",

That was the straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back, compounded with childhood SA (from a cousin).\n\nAt first, I tried to drink it away and tough it out. That carried on until about 2022. Then the dissociative fugues started. Around that time, I met a friend (not saying the city), and we became physically involved. She eventually urged me to seek help and stop drinking. Oddly enough, she knew lots of great books on PTSD recovery. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π\n\nThe day after I went to a shrink, she broke up with me‚Äîwinter of 2022. At the time, it really hurt. I didn‚Äôt know then that she also had PTSD and couldn‚Äôt deal with her trauma and mine at the same time. So I sobered up, focused on physical fitness, and poured myself into life-affirming things.\n\nFast forward to summer 2023. Out of the blue, I got an email from her asking how I was doing‚Äîand asking for advice about a career change.\n\nWe started corresponding again, and by spring of 2024, we met in person. Over the course of the year, she opened up to me more and more. I knew how big of a deal it was for her to trust me with her PTSD‚Äîit‚Äôs like holding a baby unicorn.\n\nYes, our friendship has had its highs and lows, and that used to bother me. But then I realized: it‚Äôs the PTSD. It‚Äôs hard for her to believe someone could love her unconditionally, with patience and no judgment. So, very often, she tests me‚Äîto see if I‚Äôll stay.\n\nI tried to gently convince her to see a professional, but she said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not weak, and I won‚Äôt.‚Äù\n\nNow, she‚Äôs going through an early mid-life crisis, and I‚Äôve been there for her‚Äînot to fix her, but to hurt with her. She calls me her angel. ü•π\n\nI won‚Äôt lie‚Äîit‚Äôs hard. We‚Äôll make really good progress, and then the PTSD kicks in. Recently, there were horrific events in her city. When you compound that with financial pressures, there‚Äôs only so much a person can take. She‚Äôs letting her protector/persecutor persona run the show now. The lights are on, but no one‚Äôs home.\n\nI do what I can to help‚Äîemotionally, spiritually, and financially‚Äîbut always in a way that respects her autonomy. I never let her feel obligated.\n\nShe is my best friend in the world, and I‚Äôm so worried about her. I‚Äôll keep being her rock, but something‚Äôs got to give before everything breaks.\n\nIf for some reason she‚Äôs reading this:\nYou are loved. You are cherished.

We recently moved to an area that‚Äôs not exactly prone to the LA wildfires, but we can be affected once in a while. Out of my MANY anxieties, one of them is having to make a quick escape in a fire with my cat, who is almost impossible to wrangle into a carrier and I always fear I‚Äôd have to leave her behind. \n\nWe got an alert of a nearby fire and evacuation zones were getting closer and closer to us. The moment I realized this might be happening, I full on LOST it. Hyperventilating, crying, and what I do is I start hitting myself in the head because it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm trying to snap myself out of it. My husband has never seen me like that before because I had it very under control but this was beyond me. He was a saint though. Meanwhile my sister, who lives up the street, is blowing up my phone to get our go bags ready, pack up the car, and get ready to grab the cat. I‚Äôm just‚Ä¶ useless at this point. We got everything ready and got into bed. I didn‚Äôt even change out of my clothes. \n\nWe are very lucky so far that the fire changed direction and we didn‚Äôt have to evacuate. However it was a very long night with zero sleep as I furiously refreshed fire trackers and tried to get everything I could. I didn‚Äôt sleep at all. All day today I‚Äôve been obsessively checking the fire maps. Every time my phone goes off, I think it‚Äôs either a notification about a fire nearby, or my sister texting to say we gotta run.  \n\nNow it‚Äôs time for bed‚Ä¶ and I am so exhausted and desperately need to sleep. I just can‚Äôt stop crying because I am so scared to get into bed again. My mind is racing, what if there‚Äôs another flare up in the middle of the night? What if there‚Äôs nothing but my anxiety is so bad that I don‚Äôt sleep?\n\nI‚Äôm breathing, I‚Äôm doing mantras. I‚Äôm trying to remind myself to be FREAKING GRATEFUL because so many people have lost their homes and I‚Äôm sitting here crying for no reason. I am so scared this is going to stay with me for a while. \n\nI have Xanax prescribed that I rarely take. I took one last night and one again tonight. This is very unlike me, I usually have to toss the bottles because I don‚Äôt finish them and they expire.\n\nLuckily I have my therapist appointment tomorrow but I just wanted to reach out and‚Ä¶ get support, I guess?

    "selftext": "Hey folks of reddit, I hope we are all moving into a better new year for ourselves, at least I certainly know with the chaos going on round the world, I'm wanting to find more value from bettering myself. I just was hoping at least someone can just read what I have to say about my experiences. \n\nBefore I write anything, this post will involve DV, Physical (not personally), Psychological and Emotional abuse, non sexual child abuse and mental torture from a family member. I'll try keept this as short as I can, I'm sure we all know our limits here, but I don't want to make anybodies day feel worse.\n\nIm a 26 year old male, and from as early as I can remember up until I was about 6, the situation between my parents was horrifying for me to put up with at that age. I think things happening so early really effected aspects of my development, and I guess unfortunately, Ive had to come to accept that I'm still that same terrified little boy. Fights would always begin from the smallest things, many times it would be fueled by alcohol, but a lot of it wouod be instigated by my fathers bullshit mind games with my mother, and over time just build up to a critical point. Once the fighting started, he would get really violent, throw her into furniture, drag her around by the hair outside, screaming at the top of his lungs at her, swell her entire face up. Of course she'd try give it back to him, but he was an extremely fit person and overpowered her. From about the time I could walk, when this would happen I'd run down the road, often in the middle of the night I would run over the my Grandparents house down the road, in a rural are mind you, screaming, pissing myself pleading for them to stop him. Most of the time I would be to scared to go back home for a couple days, I'd stay with my grandparents for abit then be lulled into feeling safe to go back. I don't know how many times I went through that same process, I love my grandparents and they were really the only people that made me feel safe, but as an adult myself now, the same age my father was when all this happened, I don't understand and feel a sense of anger that they would let me go through with that over and over again.\n\nOn top of all that, something else happened that I think fucked my little mind up, and this is kind of dark, and Im sure it would make a few stomachs churn, I would classify this as Psychological abuse and torture. I've had problems with blocking this out a lot. When I was around 3-4, my father sat me up on the computer, and would show me gore pictures and videos. Yeah, I was in preschool. Pictures of suicides, pictures of murders, executions, a dude that accidentally boiled himself in a bath tub with a heating element. The violence was one thing, but I really think that pushed my mind over the edge, and at such a fucking young age, now I am older, I've had to process what sort of fucking sicko shows a child whos favourite passtime is Sesame Street and the wiggles, the most disgusting realities of humanity that even adults have trouble processing. Again, I've had trouble acknowledging this ever happened, I think its been the hardest to deal with because coming to realise any innocence I once had was taken away from me by my own father. Theres a certain feeling of betrayal that gives me that the violence did not. I only told my mother about this maybe 2 years ago. Its taken me a full 30 minutes to type this out.\n\nThe DV went on up until I started 2nd grade at about 5-6. My brother was about two years old then, and my mother told me she got to the point she feared one of them were going to end up murdering each other, she finally got the courage to move to a womens refuge in town. A couple days after she did that, our countries equivalent of Family Services came and took me and my brother away from my father while my grandparents were baby sitting us.\n\nMy fathers torment didnt end here. Through a court order, most of the remainder of my childhood I had to go visit him every two weeks. For a good 5 year period up until about 10, just getting gradually better as time went on, everytime I'd go to see my father, something would stuck up that fucks ass. Whether it was his rants about murdering my mother if she ever remarried or murdering my relatives if she ever brings me around them, or murdering any future siblings she might have with anyone. If it wasnt that, it was him reminding me how much of a dissapointment I was to him, he'd always try to show me how to do something, but end up getting emotionally abusive out of frustration, and he'd never realise my failure to absorb anything he taught me was his own doing. Most of the time he would have zero patience for me and that really made it hard for me to learn things in moments of adversity.\n\nI guess he was a hard ass on me up until I got to about 12 and started giving his shit back to him, and when I started ditching school and doing drugs I think some part of him just stopped doing whatever the fuck was going on in his brain.\n\nI guess I don't want to seek therapy through a subreddit, so I will leave it here. I guess I just want somebody to vent this to. The remainder of my story is filled with emotional instability, destructive behaviours of drug abuse, difficulty forming friendships and relationships, co-dependency. I've been through therapy since about 16, but I just don't think my brain has been actually ready to feel this shit surge through me until now. I'm trying to get these free appointments for a Trauma specialist from the government, just trying to be patient about that. I've always denied I have PTSD, but a part of me feels like I've been in denial because its been easier for me to just ignore it, and unfortunately the world just sort of tries to dictate what your own issues are, so try rub a little elbow grease into It and think \"ah, everything's fine\".\n\nBut I just keep following the same path of slowly destroying myself, trying to mask everything but I'm just so darn sick and tired of it. I want to love myself more, and I feel I'm ready to acknowledge I need help with that.\n\nIf youve gotten to the bottom of this, I don't expect a reply, Im grateful youve just taken the time to read this, but at the same time I would really appreciate any guidance or thoughts people would have on myself or my experiences. Thank you.\n\nEdit: Forgive some of the grammar mistakes lol. Also, I wanted to add dissociation has been a big part of my brains way of coping, Ive done this a lot especially as a kid, Im not sure what that changes though.",

Things were made especially worse when i was prescribed drugs that seemed to only makes things worse.   I went from episodes to full on manic/fugue about a few months.  After another dr stepped in and changed my meds up m wife would tell me she would try tell me there was something wrong, but its hard to see the house is on fire when you are in it.  During this time i charged up thousands of dollars in dept and apparently went on a spending spree of my retirement fund.   I quite literally have memory of any of this.  I almost had a heat attack when i called them and they told, through the records what i had done. I am now getting bills from the IRS, and dont know what to do. i cant pay them.   I have been hiding the full horror from my wife, i dont know hot to tell her.   I have tried to kill myself three times, all failed, my thinking is when my life insurance comes in, she can pay off the bills and collect my social security benefits.   I have ruined my family's life, I am afraid it may happen again.    \nas for the reaction to the drugs, that is the real kick in the balls.  I was able to find a new doctor that took me off everything but some basic low dosage meds, that really are working.  Things have been great for years and now its all going to crumble down around me, and take everyone and everything i love.  I have been bawling my eyes out for days. I really have no idea what to do.  I feel like a coward, and cant seem to shake the guilt of what i have done to these people, maybe they are better off without me.  Sure it will hurt for a while but they will get over it. ",

    "title": "A Story of Healing from PTSD",
    "selftext": "Hello amazing community. I wanted to share my story in the hopes that it can help at least one of you. After  10+ years of struggling with chronic stress, insomnia, crippling anxiety, eating disorders and even a digestive disorder that was AWFUL and so embarrassing (all the result of a traumatic event when I was 24 + cumulative childhood traumas)... I am so happy to report that I. am. fully. healed. I never thought this was possible. I've had the darkest days, for YEARS had dark days. My healing didn't happen overnight. It was an 18mo journey, but after about 6mo I saw a lot of improvement so I kept going. And I have to keep at it every damn day bc healing is a lifelong endeavor I've found.\"\n\nSo, how did I heal from PTSD?\n\nSomeone recently told me that \"everyone heals in their own language\" and I loved that. Bc I had to try a BUNCH of things before I found my medicines. And only a few of them made an impact that was noticeable day-to-day... most of them were obvious only after reflecting and looking back and saying things like \"woah, that work drama didn't send me into a downward spiral this time\" or \"my kids bad behavior didn't make me flip out\" bc that was my life before. \n\nI started my healing journey with traditional talk therapy. I am blessed bc I had insurance that would cover it to begin with, but then I decided to really invest in a GREAT therapist (goodbye, new clothing budget but it was worth every penny). She helped me a ton (based in California) by validating that my childhood was messed up, my partner was really abusive, etc + giving me tools and leading me in somatic experiencing practices and exposure therapy practices (all really good!) that moved the needle.\n\nI started doing yoga more, and read a TON of books, so many of which changed my life (You Can Heal Yourself, the Body Keeps the Score, the Law of One, Start Here: Understanding Narcissism, The Codependent Child, etc).\n\nBut I still felt my trauma INSIDE OF ME. If that makes sense. It still reared it's ugly head. I was still struggling on and off with digestive issues and sleepless nights and anger explosions and anxiety. It was getting better, but it was still there. \n\nThen my older brother (a 4x Iraq war veteran with PTSD) told me about therapeutic psychedelic medicines and how he had done some sessions. He started with mushrooms, then ayahuasca, and both were really impactful. He tried ketamine too... but the organic medicines were the most impactful for him.   \n  \nI was SO against these \"drugs\" you guys. I never did ANY drugs, other than alcohol (which began to be a problem for me so I cut way down on drinking). I was so judgmental. But I was also desperate. I wanted JOY and PEACE and LOVE and all the things that are my birthright. So I tried it. I found an INCREDIBLE healing group in the Bay Area that is super affordable and actually certified (who knew you could get trained on this?!!!) and helps you prepare before and then integrate after the experience. So I felt fully supportive. I'm actually still in contact with my care team there... Anyway, after my first dose there was a really meaningful shift. One that I could only describe as experiencing serenity for the FIRST TIME. I didn't wake up in a panic, I could take deep breaths and get through the day, it was really nice. \n\nAfter my third session, plus an ayahuasca experience with an AMAZING trained man in Denver, CO that really helped me trust men again (THAT was a big step!), all the digestive issues went away. I mean, completely away. I started sleeping so well that I had to set an alarm again! I woke up feeling so good you guys. It's hard to describe. \n\nThe people I worked with for mushrooms gave me a bunch of holotropic breathwork practices and meditations that I do every day. Plus affirmations that I say to myself in the mirror each morning (at first it was super cheesy but then they showed me the science on positive thinking and it works!). The breathwork really helps set me up each day, and so do the affirmations. \n\nAnyway, just sharing in case anyone is searching for HOPE. Healing can happen. Keep the faith. If you have questions, feel free to reach out to me - just reply and tag me here. I've been called to help others heal now, and encourage people out there that have suffered the way I did for so long. Blessings. üíï",

I disclosed my diagnosis (PTSD) and my boss said something that I can't stop thinking about. My boss said: \"Our expectations regarding your work, and your role, will not be lowered simply because of your diagnosis. I will hold you to the same standards of success like the rest of my employees who do not have your diagnosis.\" Fine, that's fair. I get that. However, what my boss said next slightly alarmed me: \"If you continue to struggle with achieving goals related to your job, we might need to start thinking about whether or not your job - your role - is the right fit.\"\n\nNothing else. \n\nIn hindsight, I wished my boss stated something along the lines of: \"If we see that you are productive, we will move you to another role that will better accommodate your diagnosis.\" The fact that my boss didn't even say anything like this is - worrying to say the least.\n\nIs my boss's statement normal for a situation like this? Or problematic? \n\nFor people who are unable to quit their jobs due to financial concerns, but had a less-than-understanding boss like mine, how did you cope and continue your job in order to put food on the table?\n\nI am going to succeed out of spite now.\n\nUPDATE: Thank you so much, everyone, for all of your encouragement and support. I no longer feel alone, and I feel heard and understood. The bad news is: I can't just quit because I am the main breadwinner in my family right now, and I need to stay in this job for as long as I can to support my loved ones financially. It's emotionally and mentally exhausting to pretend that I like my boss in the office, especially when my boss continuously makes tone-deaf statements about my \"lack of interpersonal skills\" as someone with PTSD, but I am also reaching a point in my life in which I am starting to feel more self-confident about myself and about my skillsets as a professional. I am feeling mentally and emotionally stronger every day, and I am not going to let my boss stop me from being successful at this job. Kill em with kindness, as people always say.

    "selftext": "I am stepping away from an EMDR session because I am too stimulated to continue and frankly I just needed to get this out. I hope in some way it can help you.\n\nI guess three years ago now I was diagnosed with PTSD, ultimately that was modified to C-PTSD. Although because of the DSM, blah blah blah, for insurance purposes it says something else. I don't know why that matters but it feels invalidating. They don't recognize my truth and they control my ability to get treatment.\n\nI did this thing called an Adverse Childhood Events or something. I scored a 10/10. I remember the first time I took it I told myself I was exaggerating or lying, trying to blame my parents at 47 years old. I reread the questions over and over and the memories just kept coming. It fractured my mind causing me to disassociate. It was very frightening.\n\nWhat I can tell you for sure is that for the first 18 years of my life everyday, I lived in fear and the things that were done to me over and over again, are unspeakable. Every imaginable offence. Most was done by others while my parents were neglecting me although they had their share of abuses too, neglect, abandonment, physical, phycological. My parents weren't evil their lives as children were hell too. My parents paid for my silence. Not intentionally, but through guilt we stayed in a negative contract for 45 years. I mismanage my life. They give me money. I am the problem.\n\nI couldn't break free of the cycle because I couldn't examine what had happened because I couldn't hold them accountable. That money has held me in guilt and shame my whole life. The money kept the abuse going. And now I don't know how to live without it. Even as I am capable of running a multi-million dollar company. I have traveled the world doing business and I don't know how to live outside of this dynamic because it's all I have ever known. No matter how much I've made it was never enough. I punished myself by selling everything I love to a pawn shop. My computers, my guitars, everything. That's how much I hated myself. I left myself with nothing. Because I was nothing.\n\nI have lost what it means to be me. I am fighting with every fiber of my being to figure it out. I understand mechanistically why all this happen. the Bayesian perspective if you will. How I couldn't have done anything else because I did what I knew. I understand how my amygdala is high jacking my responses because of the reduction in pre-frontal cortex. How I have neuronal groups that should have long ago processed into deeper parts of my memory but the taste, the smells, they are all there.\n\nKnowing hasn't helped the pain, the chaos, the overstimulation. Nor did the drugs. I can't take most because I get serotonin sickness. So my only hope is EMDR. I've read all the books, examined the case studies and believe in it. But the process is hard and the progress is slow. It's like lying on a table with a shattered femur and they put the bone back together one fragment at a time, while you are awake.\n\nI keep fighting and I'm tired of fighting.

The only recollection I had is what I described. For a while (as a child) this memory confused me, all I knew was I hated being touched and had an intense fear of men.

    "title": "Am I having flashbacks?",
    "selftext": "Hey all, so this is a tough one to explain. I‚Äôll take it from the beginning. I am currently a 24F. \n\nI‚Äôll begin by saying I have experienced trauma, but what I am about to describe may or may not be related. I have never been able to connect these ‚Äúoccurrences‚Äù to a specific event/memory.\n\nI have also consulted multiple doctors already. \n\nWhen I was 17, during class, I had my first ‚Äúflashback‚Äù (that‚Äôs what I‚Äôll be calling these ‚Äúoccurrences‚Äù since I have no other terminology to use). One second I was focusing on the lecture, the next, a feeling of familiarity‚Äîsimilar to nostalgia but stronger‚Äîstarted taking over my body.\n\nIt felt nice at first, like when you rewatch a movie you loved as a child for the first time as an adult‚Äîcomforting. I almost wanted to hold onto the feeling. I wasn‚Äôt sure, though, what had triggered this or what I was even feeling nostalgic about. Then, the feeling grew and grew. I saw flashes of images (memories?) and kept telling myself, ‚ÄúI need to remember what I‚Äôm seeing,‚Äù until the feeling was no longer pleasurable but instead painful. Overwhelming. The building joy and tingles had lasted maybe 30 seconds, and the proceeding discomfort felt to be the same.\n\nThe images, thoughts, and feelings that were blasting through my body slowly began to ease and fade, until the images and thoughts stopped completely. The feeling, however, lingered. It was weak, but it was there. It followed me for a few hours that day, but most times nowadays, it only follows me for a few minutes.\n\nThe weirdest part, though, was that after that feeling of overwhelm became too much to handle and I began to slowly calm down and settle back into myself, I quickly realized I had no memory of the images I had seen or the thoughts that I had had. I remembered that I had had them and that I wanted to remember them in that moment, but there was zero memory left of what they were. I had a vague memory of maybe being at my grandma‚Äôs old house. I didn‚Äôt feel sure of it, though. I felt as if maybe I was a child. Other than that, nothing.\n\nI told my mom about what happened that day on the car ride home from school. The experience had felt exhausting physically and emotionally. It had felt confusing too, and I was honestly scared. I was shaken.\n\nPLEASE DO NOT LEAVE ANY HATEFUL COMMENTS TOWARDS MY MOM üíó, but her response was that I was overreacting and needed to sleep it off. I would feel better in the morning. It was nothing‚Äîprobably a hot flash. Girls get those. I began to cry. I was confused and wanted to understand what had happened. But I brushed it off and moved on.\n\nIt didn‚Äôt happen again until the following summer (the first one had happened in winter‚ÄîI have not kept track of any dates). That summer, though, it happened a lot. Sometimes I felt as if it was triggered by music (it was triggered twice at the start of playing one song in particular, and then once at the start of playing a different song years later), but I never knew for sure. The music that would have triggered it was newer material, though‚Äînothing that would have even been around when I was a kid.\n\nI continued to brush it off, though there was a definite growing curiosity and yearning to know WHAT exactly it is that I was seeing.\n\nFor a while after that summer, it didn‚Äôt happen. I moved in with my boyfriend after high school, and it was happening maybe twice a year at that point. I continued to brush it off, never bothering to worry about it. The flashbacks rarely ever happened anyway, and it wasn‚Äôt like it was hurting me.\n\nIt happened for the first time with another person present (one that I felt comfortable talking to, at least) when I got drunk for the first time. I was still drunk, actually. I was sick on my bed, dizzy, sitting up with my head down next to my fianc√©. I felt a flashback ‚Äúcoming on,‚Äù and I announced it to him. I quickly slurred out that he needed to ask me what I‚Äôm seeing before slipping into it completely.\n\nHe reported back that during the flashback, I couldn‚Äôt really speak. He was talking to me and asking me questions, but I seemed to be completely out of it. I was able to ‚Äúbarely mutter out,‚Äù as he puts it, a couple incoherent phrases.\n\nI was hoping that whatever I had managed to say during my flashback would be insightful, but it only further confused me. I had said random words such as ‚Äúoctopus,‚Äù ‚Äúit‚Äôs cold,‚Äù ‚Äúorange,‚Äù and other words of which I unfortunately and stupidly did not write down at the time.\n\nI continued to brush it off (a theme, if you can‚Äôt tell üòÇ spoiler alert‚Äîthis post, which I plan to share to a few different subreddits, is one of the first moves I‚Äôve taken in seriously trying to figure this out). But after that, they grew more and more frequent. I also began smoking weed, so that‚Äôs likely related (I don‚Äôt know for sure though, as it happens often even in periods where I am not smoking, and it began way before I had even tried pot).\n\nAs probability could predict, after the wedding there were more and more instances of my husband being around to witness, but each time I said nothing of substance.\n\nThe only pattern we have noticed is that I tend to mention things in the vein of ‚Äúcold,‚Äù ‚Äúwinter,‚Äù and ‚ÄúChristmas.‚Äù I had also always mentioned a smell. Sometimes I had said I loved the smell, sometimes hated. I always said, however, that the smell was familiar. One time I said it smelled of Christmas. Other than that, it was all a lot of random gibberish, all of which I still have no memory of afterwards.\n\nAt my parents‚Äô house during the holidays one year, I ingested 100mg of THC, thinking it was 5mg. What followed was something that I would compare to a mushroom-like psychedelic experience (I have done mushrooms as well, but nothing related to my flashbacks has ever occurred during those trips‚ÄîI‚Äôve only done it twice and never will again; no other drug usage, except for prescribed).\n\nAfter realizing that I was blasted out of my mind high, watching the Transformers movie with my parents, I quickly said goodnight and scurried, scared, into my room (the guest room). I immediately dialed my husband for comfort. I was panicking.\n\nGiven that this mindfuck of a high had hit me with no warning and without my permission, I was a bit frantic already at this point.\n\nI had the call on in the background as I got out of bed to turn on the LED strip lights that ran along the ceiling. They flashed bright red, and I felt like I got ‚Äútransported‚Äù into one of these flashbacks, but it was more real‚Äîmore intense‚Äîthan usual.\n\nI felt as if I was actually standing in the room with someone. I couldn‚Äôt tell who or where I was. This time, that familiar feeling was missing completely.\n\nIt passed quickly, however, and I proceeded to cry and freak out until the high wore off and I eventually stopped caring about it, per diem. But I remembered it this time. I still remember it, to this day.\n\nLife moved on. Then, a few months later, I had a flashback while standing up and doing my hair. I fell to my knees. My body felt weak. I had never ‚Äúfallen from weakness‚Äù before during these.\n\nAs I began to reflect, though, I realized I had almost always (I wish I could just plainly say always, but I don‚Äôt have 100% trust in my own memory lol) had flashbacks either sitting down or nearby enough something or someone that was easy to grab onto.\n\nCombing deeper through my memories, I began to realize that there had actually been multiple instances where I leaned into walls or shoulders for support. During one flashback in particular, slightly drunk at a friend‚Äôs wedding, I had nearly passed out on the shoulder of my husband during the groom‚Äôs speech.\n\n‚ÄúDo I always feel so weak during these?‚Äù I asked myself, for the first time.\n\nAnother time, a flashback began to hit me as I was walking my grocery cart to my car. I felt it coming, but was able to reach my car. Once I got there, though, I felt an uncontrollable urge to pee. I had enough conscious to know i wanted to avoid pissing myself in the Safeway lot at all costs. I went for a hardly less embarrassing option and squatted on the spot. I sat in the squat there staring off for a bit, I thought I had peed myself for sure. \n\nI had not peed myself, luckily, but I think I came close? I have no idea, really, all I can remember is thinking that i had. \n\nThen, I had a flashback while checking out at the grocery store. The clerk was talking directly to me, and I was staring straight through her, seeing and hearing nothing. I couldn‚Äôt manage to keep my cool and ended up regrettably causing somewhat of a scene. I had nearly collapsed.\n\n‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù she had asked me.\n\nI don‚Äôt know, I thought.\n\nI already had a regular psychiatrist at this point, and a previous one before that as well. My first psychiatrist, after explaining all of this shit to him, said he didn‚Äôt know what it was. He couldn‚Äôt call it a flashback because I had no images or references to what I was seeing or experiencing. He said it was incoherent and likely just some type of ‚Äúhot flash‚Äù or ‚Äúfaint spell.‚Äù My current psychiatrist, as well as my regular physician, have said the same thing.\n\nI went on with my life and continued to have flashbacks regularly, on and off. I‚Äôm 24 now, though, and I want to understand what‚Äôs been happening to me.\n\nThis hasn‚Äôt happened to me while I‚Äôm driving (thank GOD), but I‚Äôm scared it will. I can‚Äôt stop driving. I have responsibilities. If I had a flashback while driving, though, I don‚Äôt know what would happen. I don‚Äôt have much confidence that I would be able to keep control of my car, but PLEASE‚Äîbefore anyone jumps to leaving negative comments‚ÄîI have stopped anyway despite it being highly inconvenient.\n\nShoutout to my amazing husband üòΩüòâ who, if you couldn‚Äôt already tell, is the best.\n\nSo, folks and friends of Reddit, I come to you for answers! I have no idea if this is a trauma issue, a brain issue, a medical thing, or what. Or, if I am indeed overreacting!! I am open to that.\n\nFeel free to ask any questions in the comments‚ÄîI‚Äôm more than open to answering them.\n\nIf you took the time to read this, thank you, you wonderful human! üôÇü©∑üò∏",

    "title": "Friend's traumatic experience ",
    "selftext": "So my friend shared me something that happened to her when she was in 5th grade.\nThis is her pov-\n\n\nI was in 5th grade when this event occurred. I was friends with some boys in my class who sat next to me. They had a strange habit of playfully grabbing each other's balls for fun, similar to how girls playfully hit each other‚Äôs butts. One time, while I was at the front near the blackboard doing something I can't remember, I felt someone touch my behind, but it felt like more than that, so I looked back only to find no one there, although I made eye contact with a few boys who were seated. I thought this might have been a mistake, so I brushed it off. The next day, it happened a few more times until I finally figured out who was doing it. He was someone I knew and chatted with but wasn't really friends with. He tried to run away but couldn't, and sadly, I didn't say anything back. I just ignored him. I don't know why I didn't respond. My parents always taught me to not let anyone touch me and to speak up if it happened, but that day, I just couldn't. I went home and felt too uncomfortable to talk to my friends, maybe because I didn't know how to bring it up. How could I start my story? What if I was overthinking it? What if no one believed me since I didn't have any proof? I was 10 years old and didn't know much about situations like this. I felt awful and violated, especially since I knew other boys had seen him do that to me, some of whom were close friends, but they didn‚Äôt intervene. Moreover, I didn‚Äôt act either. So for about one or two days, I skipped school because I was afraid he would do it again, and I wouldn‚Äôt speak up. At home, I tried talking to someone‚Äîmy brother, dad, or mom‚Äîbut I never felt safe enough since my dad is very protective of me. I still can't pinpoint why I didn't speak out. There are many reasons for this that I‚Äôll explain later. So I couldn't skip school forever. I returned the next day but didn‚Äôt leave my seat even for a moment, and during lunch, I spoke to my close friends, all girls. They laughed at first and made fun of me. I even asked if I was the only one or if they had experienced something similar, but no one said a word. The girls felt uncomfortable discussing this, but later agreed to support me after a group of boys tried to push one of the guys onto a girl in our group, likely intending to touch her. We decided that we would keep an eye on their actions and support each other if they touched us. I felt empowered. In the next period, I acted as the monitor, observing everyone. I noticed a girl leaning over a bench, and the same boy who had squeezed my behind approached her to try to touch her but didn't. Worse, he was showing another guy how to do it. When the guy hesitated, he demonstrated what to do. That was when he made eye contact with me, and I rushed over to him and slapped him twice, as well as the other guy who was about to act and didn‚Äôt..\nI'm not lying, but I think many people knew about this, and no one‚Äîliterally no one‚Äîtried to stop him. They never agreed, but I don't think my opinion was wrong. He was trying to deny it when I slapped him, asking why I was raising my hands and abusing my monitor Power onto him. I couldn't say anything because of his confidence. Everybody watched, but nobody supported me. I took one of my friend's hands and went to the staff room. I cried and felt awful and weak because I couldn't confess. In the end, I couldn't say anything, and my friend had to explain everything to my headmistress. She was angry and took those two boys to the staff room. The rest, I don't know; school was over, and everyone went home. I still didn't say anything to my parents. There could be three reasons: 1. I felt maybe I would be blamed by them somehow, like why I talked to him, why did I sit in the row beside the boys' row, etc., and they are the last people I want to hear from. 2. I thought my parents wouldn't blame me but would become controlling of my actions. 3. My father has a habit of repeating incidents from my life that ended up affecting me negatively, reminding me of what I shouldn't do again. I was worried they might keep reminding me of this incident to tell me how I should stay away from men. The next day, I went to school and heard how he was slapped by every single teacher in the staff room and that his parents were called. He claimed he did this to 20 girls in class, which was surprising since nobody came to talk to me about it, even when I tried. The second guy pleaded his innocence and said I misjudged him. I asked other guys why they didn't do anything, and they acted like they didn't know. I thought I was okay at that time, but as the years passed, I didn't really recall that incident. However, when I learned about rape, abuse, and molestation, I started feeling those emotions sometimes, but not always. The first guy I dated‚Äî I couldn't open up to him about this. I only hugged him; it felt nice, but I'm always afraid of intimacy. I'm scared of what I will feel if I let a guy get close and touch me in any way. I never got close to anyone to share this story with. It's strange how guys feel awkward when discussing these topics. I understand they don't know how this feels, but I want any reaction, just not silence. Anyway, I moved houses, and when I was in 9th grade, the guy DM'd me, apologizing for that incident. I don't clearly remember what he said, but he was apologizing after 5 years. He said he was just a child and immature. He didn't realize how his actions could have affected me. I cried but didn't tell him. I said it was okay and that I was fine. I didn't talk much about this topic as I was avoiding it. Honestly, I don't know if I should say I forgive him. I probably do, because he might genuinely feel terrible about what he did, but I still feel strange. I'm 19, and I'm still scared of any form of intimacy, whether emotional or physical. I only appreciate that he feels bad about his actions. I can't imagine how I would feel if he didn't. I think he may have acted that way because he didn't understand the difference between guys and girls and that we can't behave the same way with our genders. I remember that incident often, and it hurts deeply. I cry because I never truly expressed my anger towards him or the other guys. I feel anger towards the guys who didn't stand up, the girls who laughed, the girls who didn't admit they were touched too, and my parents who never created a connection strong enough for me to confess this. I cry about this incident every time I remember, and I'm exhausted. I don't think this is trauma; girls go through worse things like rape and abuse by loved ones, which I did not experience. That guy didn't intend to assault me; he was young. I remind myself of this every day, but it doesn't help. Whenever I see my parents fighting or in a bad atmosphere, I get reminded of this incident, even though these are different situations. I watch abuse-related content and hurt myself and cry because I empathize a lot, even though I didn't go through something as severe. I read stories about women who experience these kinds of things. Sometimes, it feels like I'm not really trying to forget but to remember, but why? I should forget and move on. Why am I torturing myself? What should I do?.\n\nAlso therapy is out of question ig.\n",

    "selftext": "I, 30 FTM , have always loved dancing. Becoming a professional dancer was my life's passion. I started dance classes at 5 years old and danced ballet until I was 12 and had to take a couple years off from an injury but went back when I was 14. This was also around the same time that my abuser started to do what I now know was grooming. This continued until I was 15 or 16 (time gets fuzzy around these years) when it culminated in SA. I blocked that time out so intensely that I couldn't even acknowledge it had happened at all. I just knew that I suddenly needed to avoid certain things. These things were seemingly small but was ultimately me isolating myself, trying to hide from any reminder of the event. I stopped wearing makeup, I stopped wearing dresses, I stopped wearing form fitting clothes, and I stopped dancing.\n\nI have always been a freeze type, which I have only just figured out. I would freeze when my parents would fight, when I was assaulted, and now I freeze when I try to dance even when I'm alone. The feelings that come up are that I feel stupid, ugly, ridiculous, out of my depth, worthless, and disgusting. Those are just the identifiable ones, there are other feelings that I don't have the vocabulary to describe accurately. I feel like I want to cry, to scream, but nothing ever comes out. It's like I'm frozen solid in ice so thick you can only just make out my shadow.\n\nI've done a lot of work on myself in therapy, once, sometimes twice a week for 6.5 years. That's the reason I can even type this. I plan to continue therapy once my new insurance kicks in. I've mostly done CBT but I'm hoping to try other types of therapies like EMDR or somatic therapy, and eventually I would love to be able to dance again. I miss it terribly and I get so sad whenever I even think about dance and I feel like it would be a significant boost to my emotional regulation and self love and compassion.",

I get heart palpitations. I have migraines, body pains, dissociation, brain fog, and so many symptoms after our fights. He once abandoned me in the middle of nowhere without my wallet/purse, and now I get anxious about being abandoned in strange places. He once put a knife to his throat and threatened to slit it in front of me, and now I have flashbacks to that moment whenever I see a knife. When he's angry, I keep a mental note of all the weapons in the house. I locate the keys and plot my escape route to run out the front door. The hurtful words he's said randomly pop into my head at inopportune times while I'm trying to relax: bitch, cunt, whore, disgusting, psycho, etc. The way his eyes become dark, empty, and full of rage scares the shit out of me and invade my mind.

So, in 2017 my mom was cheating on my dad and he found out I know my dad has anger issues also he has a toxic masculinity mindset but he found out and he woke me up to tell me what happen cause he will use me to see if my mom is texting other guys and go through her phone also I was 9 at the time I told him everything cause I was scared that he would do something and he said he would not beat me well he lied he went upstairs and beat my mom out of her sleep with the belt then he came in my sister's room grab her by her hair and told me to get up and after he let go of my sister hair and came and he yell out my face I was confused and scared cause he said he would not beat but he did this night lasted for hours I fell asleep I don't know how but I did and I woke up and it was still happen but it did cool down until I woke up and he started beating us again he would call my sister a bitch and called me a f slur I thought this was never going to end until me and my sister called the police they came fast went upstairs and they arrested my dad he went to jail for a day I wish it was longer. Fast forward I'm 16 now and of course that trauma that I went through when I was 9 is affecting me alot now my mom went back to my dad yes she went back after all that I love my mom more than my dad but I hated her for doing and me and my dad's relationship is bad we keep arguing with yelling at me and when he yells at mad I start feeling things really strong like I get really mad like I just want to yell at him back also when I get mad when he yells at me I walk back and forth and then I start crying not in front of him and I talk to my self saying how much I hate him tell him to go fuck himself but not to him only to myself then every time something happens between me and my dad I always tell my friends im going to run away I need to go to house then after a few hours or the next day I realize then that was a dumb idea but I keep saying it after something happens between me and my dad also the abuse of dad has been happen before 2017 he would slap my mom and hit us my mom and dad will argue alot. Ok so now you know the story its time to tell why I think I have mild PTSD or showing early signs of it so the first thing I said about after my dad would yell at me I would get really mad and start crying also when they argue like when its just yelling and im in the room with them some times I would just wish the earth would swallow me I dont know if that is a symptom of PTSD but when it gets physical and just really bad I start crying and putting my hands in my ears and I dont have night mares but I get mild flashbacks like its not all the time but in my mind I always think about that day in 2017 thinking if I could do something different I will talk to myself about that day and I do get intrusive thoughts that would make you think I have OCD but I experience the intrusive thoughts alot more and I will think about what if it happens again and its worse the 2nd time and I do avoid my dad sometimes not all the time but thats it for right now I think I dont know if any of these are symptoms of PTSD or early signs of it but I do know that there is something wrong with me and my mental health I had a fucked up childhood and a 9 year old should have not experience that I got my childhood robbed from my dad and my mom but if you do have PTSD can you pls tell me if Im showing early signs of PTSD or its just mild or I dont have it at all im scared and confused and im also scared of getting PTSD I just need help. Sorry if this was long and dark also my dad won't let me see a therapist or psychiatrist he thinks if I just pray all my mental problems will go away and it don't it just gets worse so I don't really know what to do it will just get worse and worse until my mental problems are not mild but again sorry if this is long Thank you for reading this and I hope everyone have a good day.",

I still have pretty vivid memories of the whole event and struggle with talking about it with anyone. It's had a huge effect on my parents which in turn had a major effect of me. When I was 17 I tried weed for the first time and I've basically smoked every day since. I found it helped my anxiety and depression but I still struggle some days. I don't really talk about ptsd or any of my issues with anyone as thru experience It's hard for anyone else to truly understand what i've been thru and How I feel. I've accepted I'm addicted to weed now but have been trying to quit nicotine since I found it calmed me too but it's not worth the health risks. Any suggestions would help a lot.",

    "selftext": "Do I have repressed memories of sexual abuse as a child? \n\nA couple weeks ago, I experienced what could have been a repressed memory of being SAed as a child by my older brother. At first I thought it was just some twisted idea my brain came up with but now I'm not so sure. Looking back I've always been drawn to reading fanfiction with SA in it. I never enjoyed reading it but I just kept coming back to it. It made me feel like a horrible person even though I would never wish those things on anyone. I also tend to seek out connections with SA survivors. This, combined with me being hyper sexual but also terrified of sex at the same time has never wondering if there is more to this than just an intrusive thought. ",

    "selftext": "I‚Äôve been prescribed benzos antidepressants and antipsychotics for years and it got worse and worse over the years. Now I‚Äôm at a point to where my Benzos don‚Äôt work I take them to not withdrawal. I tried tapering a long time ago and I tapered in 5 months and had withdrawls for 7-9 months can‚Äôt remember. I would feel like people were watching me , like people were out to get me , like people were looking through my windows and watching me , I would not go for a ride in the car. I was originally diagnosed social anxiety and major depressive disorder at 17. Then at 18 made the worst mistake and took klonopin. Started at .5mg twice a day. Then .5mg 3 times a day. Then 4 a day around 22. At 24 about 1mg a day 3 times so 3 mg. Been on Paxil 40 mg which helped but caused major gi tract issues and sexual dysfunction. I am scared of my future. I am about to turn 28 this April. I got off of the Paxil and lowered the seroquel because I felt like a zombie and got tired of the side effects. I‚Äôm not sure what to do at this point.  Everything scares me now and panics me. At 21 I was diagnosed schizoaffective. I have delusions and paranoia mainly from PTSD but it‚Äôs gotten worse over the years. I lost a relationship of years and I know eventually I am going to need to taper. I don‚Äôt know how to. I don‚Äôt wanna loose my job. I don‚Äôt wanna loose years of my life. I don‚Äôt wanna go through the withdrawls I went through when I was 24. I see the doctors and they want me to get back on Paxil and also antipsychotics. I‚Äôm terrified of everything. I‚Äôm scared that I‚Äôll develop long term pssd if I get back on the Paxil. My sexual function has been altered since being off of Paxil for 3 months and it‚Äôs like sometimes I can get it up sometime I can‚Äôt. I‚Äôm needing to vent and determine if benzos are part of the problem and I‚Äôve been to so many careless doctors where do i reach out for help anymore because it used to be people who scared me who traumatized me then turned to everyone and now objects. I‚Äôm scared of my future. I am a smart good looking guy and I feel like my life is over. 27 year old male. How would I find the right doctor to taper. What is the right taper and would you guys reccomend taking other meds to stabilize me while going through the taper. I‚Äôm just at an end point. I‚Äôm not asking for medical advice I‚Äôm just asking if someone can have a similar experience or what to do to help me as I‚Äôm reaching a dead end I also have cptsd and I feel like I‚Äôm misdiagnosed ",

My dad passed 8 years ago and ever since hate snow.. I never saw his that day until was too late, but then again I'm sure my family members  watch him pass was worse. He was shoveling which induced a heart attack.  I was told the type of heart attack he had was \" ticking time bomb\". We sinced have moved to a new house ,but i now hate snow . My mom sometimes shovels and doesn't tell me ,but that is not always the case. I know she doesn't mean to do in a malicious intent. Anyways , it snowed a lot and I I heard her shoveling in my room. I looked out the windows and knew she was okay . I ran downstairs with tears in my eyes and made sure she had her phone with her. She is overweight and I got nervous . I offered to shovel and to tell me when she going out again. She didn't later in the day ,but i could hear her and see her from my room so I went back to bed once I felt she was okay and she had a neighbor shovel next to her and my windows was cracked in the slightly before I slept.  I feel bad I cried and made her upset. It crazy because my dad always made us shovel ,but didn't that year because it was all ice. I know he would of died regardless of the shoveling ,but yeah.  It hard because he wasn't really the dad i always wanted until after high school until I was 21.  Then it was poof just taken aback . Apartently his grandparents died of heart attacks and idk if he even knew that . It is sad because the night before I had feeling compelled to tell him something, but my mom told me not to. My mom did a psychic  reading 2 months before and said the marriage would end. My dad never believed in the spiritual stuff so I also didn't think it be worthwhile.  Plus he was so happy and excited that night with his friends and telling me about the movie he saw. I didn't want to end it on a bad note. He was rarely in that mood and the morning he passed I did hear his voice in the hallways but I was in and out of sleep. He opened my door to let the cat in and when I woke up again he was gone.\n\nI think this happened last year too in regards to freaking out with my mom and tbh im not ready to have another parent pass away .. Im grateful I can vent on here. Also I'm not looking for any sympathy about my dad. I got through today!F29",

    "selftext": "I‚Äôm in such a dark place. I was always such a sweet kid. I was nice to everyone. But I never got that same kindness back. I used to be sweet and inclusive and extroverted. But over the years I‚Äôve become introverted and I was still kind but the last year I don‚Äôt even have that anymore.\n\nMy whole life I‚Äôve been abused and raped and bullied I‚Äôm 17 now but it started to get bad when I was 8 years old. So really more than half of my life I‚Äôve been hurt. And I never understood why. I didn‚Äôt deserve it. I‚Äôm in the UK so I started college at 16 but wasn‚Äôt allowed to go straight to the course I wanted because I went to a special needs school since I was 13 and they thought I wouldn‚Äôt be able to handle it. So I did a one year foundation course then this year I started my main course. And it was awful. \n\nMost of my year group were awful. There was this girl who accused an older student of being a rapist. And to further push the narrative he was a creep she told people that I had sex with him. Knowing he was a rapist. To make him seem like a creep since I‚Äôm way younger than him. And make me seem like I don‚Äôt care about rapist. \n\nAnd the whole class turned against us even though I wasn‚Äôt even close to him and definitely didn‚Äôt have sex with him or even really speak to him. She and a group of her friends would get really mad if people spoke to me. They would give me the silent treatment and if other people wouldn‚Äôt give me the silent treatment they would turn people against them too for supporting a person who ‚Äúsupports rapists‚Äù. They also said that I sent this guy nudes and that he was sharing the pictures of me online. Which is obviously not true either.\n\nBut everyone hated me. And even in group activities would ignore me and talk infront of me or walk away from me so that I‚Äôd not know what to do and look like an idiot. \n\nSo I ended up leaving college. Because of that and I ended up in hospital because of a chronic illness and when I came back they wouldn‚Äôt tell me what to do in the group project. So not only was it physically difficult to go in but they was making it almost impossible for me to get any work done.\n\nAfter I left my friends told me that the girl who accused the guy of rape had ‚Äúforgiven‚Äù him. And became his friend. \n\nI lost it. I needed to ruin them. I used an old phone to spam call them and used a text to speech thing when they‚Äôd pick up telling them awful things and threatening them. It was big news and my friends not knowing it was me told me the college called the police and so did the girl but the police said it was no big deal. This made me take it further and keep doing it. And I made fake social media accounts saying awful things to them. \n\nI know I‚Äôm just as bad as them and my friends keep telling me how scared they are but I don‚Äôt care as much as I should. I hate that my whole life everyone‚Äôs treated me awfully and I never got the chance to defend myself. I‚Äôm a suicidal drug addict for fuck sake. It shouldn‚Äôt have gotten to this point. I don‚Äôt get why my whole life has been like this. I just wanted to be the powerful one for once. But now I‚Äôm just as much of a monster as them. And it‚Äôs been ages and I‚Äôm still doing it. \n\nThey‚Äôve given up trying to stop it. Because no one will help them. They feel powerless just like I did. And people are turning against them because they think they are attention seeking. The main rapist accuser actually left the college. \n\nI really am such an awful person. Maybe I feel a bit of guilt Ive definitely taken it too far. But it‚Äôs just I‚Äôm so angry my whole life I‚Äôve been treated like dirt. I want to die. I‚Äôve given myself more reason too. I‚Äôm just as bad as everyone else.",

    "selftext": "I am not told of a PTSD diagnosis but there is definitely trauma in the past.\n\nI was told by my partner that they had been for a few years in the past on the receiving end of abusive behaviour including an ex trying to strangle, being on their guard, and the ex being sectioned.  The ex refused to move out and for a number of years they continued to pay all the bills and lived in the same house as non-romantic but instead as a 'carer' and then as a 'friend'.  I could never get my head around why they stayed for years afterwards?  Any insights?\n\nI'm aware they they receive counselling for the past couple of years, and takes and take a low dose SSRI for anxiety.  I'm not privy to what actually went on in counselling.\n\nMy partner and I over a year of dating had such loving and happy times, for 99% of the time, and were planning a future.\n\nHowever, my partner claimed they wanted a 'drama free' existence and avoided any situations that might be perceived as stressful however minor the conflict.  This was frustrating as sometimes they would cut short my reasonable conversation where they seemed disinterested or perhaps perceiving a potential conflict.  Or make a controversial statement and refuse to justify and stonewall and shut down.\n\nI have anxiety myself.  Perhaps once a month these incidents escalated where I lost patience and challenged this behaviour and there was always a strong sensititivity to a raised voice in particular and where I continued to press my point.  It seems they were overwhelmed.  A distressing argument ensued.  We agreed that if this continued we would seek counselling as everything else was so beautiful.\n\nI am desperately sad and sincerely sorry to say that before that happened on the last incident I shouted at them.  I'm told close up but not sure I was that close.  Even though I apologsed profusely soon after, the next morning they left suddenly and unexpectedly, stopped communicating until ending things after a couple of days, then not collecting valuable things or accepting calls.  I got essentially one chat for half an hour where I was told I was abusive and this would not be tolerated.   I did push for a resolution over the following days but this proved counterproductive.\n\nAll the beautiful parts our relationship were briefly acknowledged but quickly 'blocked out' and refused to be discussed.  The total blame is put on me.\n\nThe personality changed overnight and there was a numbness (that I think is known as disassociation) that was hard to cope with as we were so chatty and tactile normally, they heartbreakingly flinched when I tried to gently touch an elbow, a hostility as if protecting oneself when I only ever loved them.  I vowed the 'shouting at' would never happen again and that it was a one off and offered to get help to be certainI would not.\n\nAll my friends say the reaction to end things so brutally was wholly disproportinate for someone who appeared to be so in love with me when they saw us together not long before.  I was asked to send on their remaining things which I did.  I'm told in that letter, that they 'wish all the best for me',  but they 'must put their mental health first' and that they do not want to see me again.\n\nI do need to make contact over something they is aware is necessary and would accept.  I have waited a number of weeks before doing so in the hope they will be amenable to me reaching out to try to make peace and heal in a way they were not before.\n\nPlease be kind for any ignorance I show.  I did my best but was human and made a mistake, was immedately sorry I did not consider their past trauma in the moment, but seek to understand what happened, and why, and don't want to cause any more distress to them but for me they is throwing away what was for the most part such a beautiful loving relationship.  It's heartbreaking.\n\nI accept the prospects seem poor of reconcilation but I love them and would do anything to help them and I heal.  Is there hope if I use a careful approach when reaching out?",

This went on for about 10 minutes before someone spotted me and took me out of the room, and she passed 10 minutes later. My mom arrived about 6 minutes after she passed and I was the one who told her.\n\nMy mom beats herself up about the fact that I was alone, but I'm glad I was the one there to witness this and not her or my sister. While I'm glad it was me, I'm so traumatized. I'm trying to remember her in any other way but I can't. Every time I close my eyes I see everything happen all over again. I don't want to sleep at night because I know I'll see it. I had a panic attack while washing my face today because I couldn't open my eyes. My heartbeat has been elevated since then and no matter what I do I can't calm down. I get so nauseous thinking about her and I feel terrible that I'm like this. I can't grieve her normally. \n\nShe raised me and it's so hard to remember the woman who raised me and not the woman who was dying in front of me. \n\nWill this feeling ever go away? This changed me and I don't think I'll ever go back to the person I was before this. ",

    "title": "Bad experiences with lamictal?",
    "selftext": "Hi. I‚Äôm just looking for people who may have had similar or relate-able experiences to me while using Lamictal. \n\nI have PTSD (and CPTSD but am in the US, so only unofficially) due trauma that occurred during my teens (am 27 now). I have dissociative features with the PTSD too (my doc says even though I am diagnosed DPDR, it actually is PTSD causing the dissociation and DPDR is the label given to people who have no traumatic explanation or association with the symptoms). There recently was a trigger that made my PTSD flare up and thus I decided to seek medical and therapeutic treatment for it.\n\nOn the medicine side, apart from Lexapro (which helped a little), the other drug I tried was Lamictal. I have heard Lamictal helped a LOT of people with reducing PTSD symptoms and even lowering dissociation. However‚Ä¶for me it seemed like Lamictal did 100% the exact opposite. My flashbacks became WAY more frequent. I would get lost in my flashbacks and be nearly psychotic as I would just keep repeating saying the things I said during the actual trauma. I would cry for hours and be dissociated for days before and after the flashbacks. In fact the whole time I was on lamictal, and 2 months afterwards, I seemed to have terrible dissociation. My long term memory and short term memory were hazy as hell and a lot of my trauma related symptoms flared up too (validation seeking, avoidance of triggers). Mood was also unstable as hell and very sensitive to external stimuli. My brain seemed completely destroyed - i was a very mathematical and engineering oriented person but on lamictal i couldn‚Äôt do basic thinking. \n\nIt just seems so strange to me given so many people vouch for it. Anyone else experience negative experience on lamictal?\n\nFor what its worth‚Ä¶i also have ADHD‚Ä¶i mean i am diagnosed ADHD but it could be just a manifestation of complex trauma. ADHD med finally kicked my brain back to what i think it used to be before the lamictal. ",

    "title": "(Advice needed) Failing school and need to tell my mum, but it will trigger my PTSD.",
    "selftext": "Before I ask anything I want to talk about the event that caused my 2nd round of PTSD. A fun bit of abuse.\n\n4 years ago me and my mother lived seperately from my father after she thought it was unsafe, 3 years ago she decided we needed to move back in with him. I did not want to, I already had PTSD from childhood abuse and it seemed like a total non-option at the time. My mother (in all her wisdom) when I was having a panic attack over moving in decided to cut herself so she could come in and show me while yelling at me that it was all my fault she hurt herself for not wanting to move back in with him. (I've recently come to realise that this is the first time I know of her cutting herself. She is usually quite open about her struggles depression, and has not mentioned doing it before, neither does she have any scars. Which is not helping. I dont know if it was genuine or if she was purposefully trying to manipulate me.)\n\nSince that event I've become terrified of worrying or upsetting my mother, avoiding doing or saying anything that could upset her. Whenever I've tried to talk to anyone about it I've ended up sobbing before I can finish the extremely non-discript and normal sentence, \"I dont want to worry her\". Just thinking about telling her something that might upset her has me rattled. So its got me BAD\n\nAnyway, this year I have failed a college course. Before the second term of college. My health and social care course has a discriminatory policy that was not advertised, and if you fail one unit you fail the entire course. This policy has prevented me from completeing two units and theres nothing my school can do about because the policy comes from the board yada yada whatever . I failed through no fault of my own and have since stopped attending because why would I, a fail is a fail and I dont feel comfortable continuing under a discrimatory board. I need to tell my mother this. I have an exam real soon and she's going to get suspicious when I dont give her results at the end of the year. I need to tell her basically right away, and I've waited so long my tutor is offering to email her instead. \n\nSo you can probably tell thats the one thing I really do not want to do right now. Even though me failing was so out of my hands I cannot bring myself to tell her. Recently she has expressed being extremely depressed. So I extra don't want to tell her. I could ask my tutor but he really wants to know why im so worried  and I really dont want a phone call home. What am I meant to do here??? Every option, telling her, having my tutor tell, lying and have her find out in 6 months anyway, all seem really really bad. Really bad. I super dont know what to do and its affecting my other classes and general mental health.",

    "title": "Tips for young children with ptsd please",
    "selftext": "Hello, this is my first Reddit post so forgive me if this is in the wrong group and if this is way too long. My son is 5 years old and in kindergarten. He broke his arm running at PE at the end of October. I believe he was in shock and he is a shy kid, and he didn‚Äôt mention his arm hurting as bad as it was and he sat there for at least 2 hours before the teacher noticed the swelling and called me. I immediately raced to the school to get him and all the color was gone from his face. I knew it wasn‚Äôt a normal fall. We went straight to the hospital where the X-ray showed what I was afraid of. He had a nasty fracture in his elbow. The Dr. starts saying he needs emergency surgery. There are a lot of things that happened at this first hospital, the nurse couldn‚Äôt get the IV, there‚Äôs blood all over his arm, it is sending my son into total distress. This is a small farm town with a little bitty backwoods hospital. I start having a gut feeling to leave but everything is happening so fast and my husband is leaning towards staying at the little hospital once the orthopedic surgeon tells him its a super common fracture and he can operate first thing in the morning. We decide to stay for the time being, my son just wants to rest in bed and I lay with him all night. He also has asthma and I am increasingly worrying how that will affect surgery because it seems to be flairing up. Morning comes and his second IV literally falls out of his arm and he now needs a 3rd IV. More distress. My amazing parents come and at this point I am a wreck and I am done with the hospital and ask my mom how to get out of here. She sets out to get us transferred. The nurses are acting so weird and saying ‚Äúdon‚Äôt tell anyone we told you how to request a transfer‚Äù it was so strange and I wanted to get the hell out of there asap. The transfer is approved to a great women and children‚Äôs hospital. We have a 2 hour ambulance ride. It is now probably 24 hours after the break. We get to the new hospital and immediately they start prepping him for surgery stating that while his fracture was common, the way his bone fractured was actually really rare. My son goes into surgery, it goes perfectly. The team at this hospital are angels, truly amazing people. He gets 3 pins in his elbow and a small incision to ensure the nerve doesn‚Äôt get damaged. He gets a soft cast to allow swelling and we spend the night resting and getting asthma treatment. We leave the next day about 48 hours after the break. I am going to try and wrap this up. He missed a week of school, we got his hard cast on, he returns to school. He is definitely reserved and a little nervous but he does fine at school. He was not allowed to play at PE under Dr orders, so he sat out with the teacher. Fast forward to the cast removal. He gets his cast cut off and X-rays. His arm looks great! Now it‚Äôs time to remove the pins though. I hold him tightly as the nurses quite literally tug 3 pins out of his bone. He is in absolute distress but it‚Äôs over, we made it and his cast is off. I think this is finally the beginning of the end of all this. But it‚Äôs like a switch flipped. He withdrew, he started panicking about returning to school. He is saying over and over that he can‚Äôt leave me and he cant go back to PE. He is genuinely terrified and anxious. At school the teacher calls me and explains he can‚Äôt stop crying. She asks if she can get the school counselor involved and I say absolutely. I also call an outside children‚Äôs counselor and get him an appointment the next day. He cries and clings to me every morning but he is opening up to the school counselor and sitting with her at lunch and PE. He is still teary and is having trouble focusing in school on his tasks. Each day is pretty rough but it seems to get just a little better each day. School lets out for Christmas. He has a great time off, but is worrying about leaving me and returning to school. Over the break during the counseling he is diagnosed with separation anxiety and ptsd. A little background, I am a stay at home mom and PreK last year was his first time ever really being away from me and he struggled with that but ultimately had a good time at school and had no problem making it through the day. Anyway, today is the first day back at school and last night was super rough. He cried himself to sleep in my arms while I told him these feelings are okay and they won‚Äôt last forever. This morning was rough. My husband does drop off and I do pickup. I could barely get him in the car seat. His teacher has been so amazing and communicative and willing to help any way she can. Counseling is still in the very early stage and while we have received a diagnoses, we haven‚Äôt started actually figuring out what to do. So I am sitting here writing this asking for any advice or help or tips from anyone who has possibly been through this with their children. The beginning of this year was so great for him. He loved his teacher, he had friends, he was excited about school, and now he is a totally different kid with a totally different experience. It‚Äôs heartbreaking. Of course I wish I could just keep him with me all the time and protect him. I just want to get back to a place where he feels safe at school again and secure being away from me temporarily. Any advice will be greatly appreciated, thanks so much for taking the time to read this. \n\n  \n",

    "title": "I am just now coming to terms with my PTSD",
    "selftext": "I was diagnosed with PTSD around 11 years ago (I‚Äôm 26 now). I was confused by the diagnosis because I thought I hadn‚Äôt experienced trauma. I found out I was diagnosed with it when I was admitted to the psych ward after a suicide attempt when I was 15. I was confused. \n\nI‚Äôve been in therapy fairly regularly since then. It dawned on me slowly. My dad currently has acute myeloid leukemia, but before that he had polycythemia vera. He was diagnosed when I was 3 when he started bleeding internally. He got a chunk of his GI tract and his spleen removed. When I was 8, he had another catastrophic internal bleed. Hospitalized for months, more surgeries. \n\nWhen I was 11, my mom‚Äôs mom came to live with us since her dementia had gotten to a point where she couldn‚Äôt live independently. I also have a sister who‚Äôs 3 years older than me who is autistic, has severe epilepsy, is nonverbal, and requires round-the-clock care. Shortly after my mom‚Äôs mom moved in with us, my dad had another catastrophic internal bleed. I remember him showing up in my bedroom doorway looking white as a sheet and saying he had to go to the hospital. I didn‚Äôt see him again for three months. In the meantime, our house was hell. Once I went upstairs while my mom was taking a shower to get a book, and she came out of the shower while I was still upstairs. She grabbed me, pulled me to the top of the stairs, and told me I was a murderer, that I could have let my sister or grandmother die and I was a murderer. She screamed at me so loud that my oldest siblings came and literally shielded me with their bodies and begged her to stop. \n\nI remember my sister screaming so loud that the cops were called on us multiple times. She would scream and bang her head against the wall when she got overwhelmed. When she screamed, I started to cry too, because it was hard to see her in pain, because at the time she was my best friend. My mother would say, don‚Äôt you fucking dare cry. I couldn‚Äôt stop crying so I would just go hide, and she would say, why are you running away? Why do you hate your sister? \n\nI love my mother, and we have a great relationship now, but she is mentally ill and becomes a different person under severe pressure. Once during that hospitalization of my dad, she served dinner to all us kids and we started eating before she sat down‚Äîvery normal for our family, she‚Äôs stressed to us that she hates the normal etiquette rules and we can always eat if we‚Äôre hungry‚Äîbut this time she screamed and pounded the table and called us ungrateful idiots. My sister started scream-crying. I started crying. I wanted to go to my room and calm down, but our mom screamed at me to stay at the table and eat. It was Mother‚Äôs Day. One of my oldest siblings said, ‚Äústop being mean to him.‚Äù She screamed ‚ÄúNO‚Äù in this voice I‚Äôll never forget. Our family dog started to growl and snap at her. I remember everything eventually quieted down and we ate in silence. I was trying to stop crying and not throw up. \n\nMy dad eventually came home. He was very weak and sick for a while. He eventually got his strength back and started working again, and he would have to go on business trips. I remember being 12-13 and begging him to please not leave me alone with my mom. My oldest siblings had gone to college by then. I was so scared. He didn‚Äôt know what it was like without him there. I told him how scared I was of her and he just told me to listen to her and be polite.\n\nTo be a better brother, I downloaded a recording of my sister scream-crying to my iPod and listened to it over and over again to desensitize myself. My mom calling my name still scared me. If I didn‚Äôt run out of my room and respond quick enough, she‚Äôd be furious. To this day, I‚Äôm scared to wear headphones or earphones because I‚Äôm paranoid. I always have only one ear in. I‚Äôve lived outside of my parents‚Äô house for 8 years. \n\nI attempted suicide at 15. I truly felt my family would be better off without me. Someone my parents were boarding at the time found me and raised the alarm. I remember coming in and out of consciousness on the way to the hospital and my mom screaming why? why? why? She then read all the diaries I‚Äôd kept fastidiously since I could write. I remember her coming to the hospital and telling me she‚Äôd read all my diaries and my vision just going gray. We‚Äôre both writers, and she‚Äôd read everything that was precious and personal to me. As an adult now, I understand why she would do it. At 15, I felt like nothing would ever be okay again. I had access to a notebook in the hospital and I wrote ‚ÄúI hate you, I hate you,‚Äù etc. over and over again. When I was discharged, she threw that notebook away. It was also full of things I wrote about wanting to live again‚Äîpoetry about what I‚Äôd seen out the window of my room. \n\nMy mom has since apologized for how she treated me when I was a kid. She‚Äôs calm and kind and I feel comfortable disclosing things about my life to her. Just tonight we went to Home Depot together and laughed to the point of crying over me carrying a huge bag of rock salt that had a tear in the bottom and me trailing rock salt everywhere I went. We talk candidly about our depression and anxiety. When I recently had a horrible back-to-back series of panic attacks, she was there and talked me through them and sat in the mental hospital waiting room with me for six hours. \n\nI went back to therapy this month after a year and a half without it. I‚Äôve always felt like what I went through shouldn‚Äôt be considered trauma. But I have night terrors about it. Both of my exes and my current roommate have complained that I wake up screaming and thrashing, and I do wake up screaming. I did a sleep study once to address my insomnia, and they told me the data was inconclusive because I was awake too much. I punched my ex in my sleep once. Most nights I wake up screaming not remembering why I‚Äôm screaming. Day-to-day I often get panic attacks that render my body unusable. I have to hide at work. Sounds that are tonally similar to my sister crying trigger them. I can‚Äôt stop them. They‚Äôre very physical. I stopped listening to music because tones similar to my sister crying trigger panic attacks.\n\nI went back to therapy recently after a therapy hiatus. I tried to talk as honestly as possible. My therapist and psych said I don‚Äôt have generalized anxiety, just PTSD. My ‚Äútrauma‚Äù feels stupid, even now that I‚Äôve accepted it was trauma. I wish I‚Äôd been stronger. I wish I had been a better kid to my parents. I wish I was better. ",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\nI haven‚Äôt been officially diagnosed, but I believe I may have CPTSD. I grew up in a DV household, and the abuse continued until I was 24. After that, I moved in with friends and eventually became estranged from both of my parents a couple of years ago.\n\nAt 26, I finally got my own place, and I‚Äôve worked hard to stay off the grid‚Äîchanging my number and cutting contact. I‚Äôve found peace being away from my parents and truly don‚Äôt want any contact with them. My boyfriend and his family have been amazing and supportive, and I‚Äôm grateful to have found a safe environment with them.\n\nHowever, a situation with my best friend has left me feeling betrayed. She knew everything about my trauma, but she ‚Äúforgot‚Äù and gave my aunt my phone number after I specifically told her not to. This led to my aunt and later my mom contacting me, which forced me to change my number yet again.\n\nWhile I initially tried to brush it off, I can‚Äôt shake the betrayal. My boyfriend‚Äôs mom gave me great advice and said it‚Äôs time to end the friendship because I can‚Äôt trust her. It‚Äôs been hard because I‚Äôm sad about ending a friendship I‚Äôve had for so long, but I know I need to protect my peace.\n\nOn top of that, I‚Äôm still struggling with the trauma of my past. I keep having nightmares about my parents, and being alone sometimes makes me feel scared or sad. I‚Äôve also been on edge, dealing with low self-esteem and confidence issues. I‚Äôve tried therapy before, but it wasn‚Äôt solution-based, and I didn‚Äôt find it helpful.\n\nI‚Äôve found a new place for therapy and really hope it works because I‚Äôm tired of feeling stuck in this pain. When things get overwhelming, I sometimes turn to wine or weed gummies to escape, but I don‚Äôt want that to be my only way to cope. I‚Äôm an artist, and painting has been a part of my healing process, but I don‚Äôt always feel motivated to create.\n\nMy question is: How do I begin to truly heal from the hurt of my past and the loss of trust in people I cared about? How can I manage the overwhelming feelings without feeling like I‚Äôm drowning?\n",

    "selftext": "Working in project for my kids, future vets, families.  Specifically trying write from framework of the chaos of ptsd without using specific traumas or shaming my partner and those who were part of my journey through the suffering.\n\nLemme know what think or should expand into. Thanks\n\n********\n\n Chapter 1: The Unseen War\n\nThe first thing they don‚Äôt tell you about PTSD is how invisible it is. Not just to the outside world, but even to the people closest to you, the ones who love you, depend on you, and look to you for strength. And when you can‚Äôt explain it, when even you don‚Äôt fully understand what‚Äôs happening inside your own head, the silence becomes its own battlefield.\n\nI loved her. God, I loved her. She was my everything andmy best friend, the mother of my children, the guide who kept me anchored when life felt like a storm. But love isn‚Äôt always enough. That‚Äôs another thing they don‚Äôt tell you. PTSD doesn‚Äôt care about love. It doesn‚Äôt care about the promises you made or the dreams you built together. It creeps into the spaces between you, turning connection into distance, joy into frustration, and safety into something foreign.\n\nI didn‚Äôt mean to hurt her. I never wanted to be the thing that broke her spirit. But when you‚Äôre fighting a war inside your own head, it‚Äôs hard to see how much damage is spilling over onto the people you care about most.\n\nThe Weight of Responsibility\n\nWhen you live with PTSD, the world expects you to carry the weight of your own healing. You‚Äôre supposed to explain it‚Äîto your spouse, your kids, your friends. You‚Äôre supposed to find the words to make them understand why you‚Äôre distant, angry, or numb. You‚Äôre supposed to reassure them that it‚Äôs not their fault while simultaneously trying to figure out how to put yourself back together.\n\nAnd when that explanation doesn‚Äôt come‚Äîor worse, when it comes out wrong‚Äîit‚Äôs your family that suffers. She suffered. She tried so hard to love me through it, to hold onto the version of me she fell in love with. But the truth is, that version of me was slipping further away, and I didn‚Äôt know how to stop it.\n\nThe Struggle to Make Her Happy\n\nI spent years trying to make her happy. Not just because I wanted to, but because I believed it was my responsibility. I thought if I could just do more, be more, give more, then maybe I could fix what was broken between us. But the harder I tried, the more I felt like I was failing.\n\nPTSD makes everything feel like a fight. Even love. It turns everyday interactions into battles you‚Äôre not equipped to win. I wanted to respond to her needs, to her hurt, but most of the time, I was just reacting‚Äîreacting to my own pain, my own triggers, my own inability to explain what was going on inside me.\n\nShe deserved better. She deserved the man she married, the one who made her laugh and feel safe. And I wanted to be that man. But PTSD doesn‚Äôt just take from you‚Äîit takes from the people who love you, too.\n\nHonoring Her\n\nHere‚Äôs the hardest part to admit: I wasn‚Äôt the only one fighting. She was, too. She fought for me, for our family, for the life we built together. She was strong in ways I didn‚Äôt always see at the time. She carried burdens I should have shared with her but couldn‚Äôt.\n\nShe‚Äôs the mother of my children, and I‚Äôll always honor her for that. She taught them how to love, how to care, how to navigate a world that can be so unkind. She gave them pieces of herself that will always be a part of them.\n\nAnd she was my guide. Even in the moments when we were lost, she showed me what love and resilience look like. She stayed when it would have been easier to leave. She fought for me even when I didn‚Äôt know how to fight for myself.\n\nOwning My Part\n\nBut love isn‚Äôt about erasing accountability. I have to own my part in what happened. PTSD may have been the villain in our story, but I was the one who let it control me. I was the one who let my reactions dictate my actions, who didn‚Äôt have the tools to communicate my needs, my pain, my hope.\n\nI let the weight of my own struggles blind me to hers. And that‚Äôs a truth I‚Äôll carry with me for the rest of my life. It‚Äôs not self-pity‚Äîit‚Äôs responsibility. It‚Äôs knowing that while PTSD shaped my actions, it didn‚Äôt absolve me of the impact those actions had on her and our family.\n\nThe Unspoken Hurts\n\nShe once said something to me that still echoes in my mind: ‚ÄúI just want to understand.‚Äù She wasn‚Äôt asking me to be perfect. She wasn‚Äôt asking me to be someone I wasn‚Äôt. She just wanted to know the man she married was still in there somewhere.\n\nBut how do you explain something you don‚Äôt fully understand yourself? How do you put into words the way your heart races at nothing, the way your mind replays scenes you‚Äôd give anything to forget, the way you feel disconnected from the people you love even when they‚Äôre right in front of you?\n\nIt‚Äôs not fair. None of it is fair. Not to me, not to her, not to anyone who‚Äôs ever had to live with the ripple effects of trauma. But fairness isn‚Äôt the point. Healing is. Growth is. Redemption is.\n\nMoving Forward\n\nI‚Äôll never stop loving her. Not in the way we once were, but in the way you love someone who shaped your life and gave you three amazing children. I‚Äôll honor her not by trying to fix the past, but by learning from it‚Äîby becoming the man I wanted to be for her, even if it‚Äôs too late for us.\n\nThis journey isn‚Äôt about erasing the hurt. It‚Äôs about transforming it. It‚Äôs about taking the lessons, the pain, and the love, and using them to create something better. For me. For my kids. And maybe, one day, for someone else.\n\nBecause at the end of the day, PTSD isn‚Äôt the whole story. It‚Äôs just one part. The rest of the story is still being written, one step at a time. Always forward. Never alone. \n",

    "selftext": "I'm telling you my experience hoping someone can help me understand what to do: after giving birth to my daughter I suffered from severe anxiety. Various psychiatrists prescribed me SSRI‚Äôs that didn't work. I would wake up in the morning with anxiety and go on like that all day. In the evening when I returned home from work it was the worst part: I had many intrusive thoughts that literally scared me to death. I felt huge waves of fear and I couldn't do anything. I couldn't cook or wash my daughter. It was horrible.  I had a lot of paranoia, a lot of anxiety, fear, I thought I was going crazy. The mere word \"crazy\" or \"psycho\" made me scared because I was afraid of becoming one. The worst time as I was saying was around 5pm until just before going to sleep when everything faded away and became livable. All this went on for 4 years until a doctor decided to have me do blood tests which revealed a hormonal imbalance. They prescribed me the pill (bc) and since then things have definitely gotten better. I no longer have anxiety and only when my period comes and during the first pills I feel anxious again. I forgot: at first they gave me a pill that was probably too strong and it sent me into a deep depression for a few days (until I stopped taking the pill and things gradually got better).\n\nI'm finally better but I have several memories of these past four years that often make me worry and don't let me live my life well. In particular when I hear about depression I get very scared because I have really bad memories of the days that I had to go through. Furthermore I never live the afternoon well. Those hours from 5 to 7 pm always scare me a little and I'm not happy. \n\nThere are days when I pay little attention to it and days when everything becomes dark and I cry a lot for what happened and for the fear that it could happen again.\n\nThis is my story, and I would like some advice on what to do. I‚Äôm really afraid i might get worse with emdr but i don't want to miss an opportunity to be really well. Or maybe cbt could be enough?\n\nI am currently on 10 mg of paroxetine and the contraceptive pill.\n\nPlease be kind and reassuring. Here is a mother who has suffered so much and who would like to free herself from all this to be able to live better with her daughter and her family.\n\nAlso: I hope my story can be useful to some other mother too ü©∑",

I am in a really good relationship with my boyfriend, we are so happy and he is so perfect. The only issue we have is that I don‚Äôt like that he watches porn and masturbates. He does it often, multiple times a day and multiple times during the night. We have talked about how I feel and he has been doing it less, but he also lies to me about doing it when I know he is.

It makes me really uncomfortable and makes me feel very anxious. \nA little back story, when I was younger, about age 9-13 my mom dated a guy that used to groom me.

I‚Äôm a 28(M)\n\nI have 3 major traumas I experienced in the last 4 years that have made it nearly impossible to work because of panic attacks and constant intrusive thoughts and physical discomfort\n\nTrauma #1:\nI got a call around 7 am from my dad around 4 years ago that my little cousin overdosed on fentanyl and died at 18 years old, my cousin and I had been best friends since he was just a toddler, he was basically the closest person to me out of, best friends doing many things together\n\nTrauma #2:\n3 years ago I was on my way home from work around 1 am when a person ran a red light and hit me in my driver side door, the impact knocked me out and threw me into the passenger seat, i crawled out of my passenger door and the ambulance and police were already there or just pulling up, the entire thing was a blur. I was transported by ambulance to the hospital and had no major injuries. My injuries consisted of heavy bruising, stitches in the side of my head, and a few cuts and scrapes. However I found out recently when requesting medical records that the hospital never checked my head, they gave me an X-ray of my head thats it and I‚Äôve been struggling badly since this accident. This accident is what I have been blaming for my mental issues \n\nTrauma #3:\n2 years ago i was at work, at the same job I had been in the accident driving home from. It was about 2 hours into my shift when I got a call that my sister was in a motorcycle accident and was being taken by lifelite to the hospital from the accident scene, my mental health at this point was already bad from my accident and losing my cousin. My sister was intubated in a coma for a couple of months in the icu with brain damage and other serious injuries. I only went to the hospital to see her twice because I was having severe panic attack issues. Fast forward to now she is in a nursing home in the small town I live in with a traumatic brain injury. She is completely disabled on a feeding tube, the only thing she can do is talk and is in severe pain. I don‚Äôt go see her like I should but I still do visit even if it‚Äôs only once a month. This led me to ultimately leaving this job because of my mental health and relating working there to the trauma.\n\nTrauma: A 4th thing √ç should add is when my cousin overdosed my grandpa blamed me for his death, because at the time I was also experimenting with the same type of drugs, I had quit for a couple months and was trying to help my cousin stop using them. Then he overdosed, and soon after my grandpa put the blame on me, then he got Covid and died, me and my grandpa were always very close but I almost have resentment that he blamed me. It caused a massive blow up in the family with my dad going and having issues with my gpa because of him trying to place the blame on me, as if losing my cousin wasn‚Äôt already extremely hard.\n\nBasically √ç just wanted to share my story because I know everyone goes through different things in their lives that can be traumatic but I‚Äôve been having a terrible time coping. I am seeing a therapist every other week and go in for intake at an intensive outpatient counseling center next week. I‚Äôm physically shaking typing this out it‚Äôs pretty crazy. I also have been on lexapro which gave me some relief for awhile until I tried going back into my main field of work and experiencing panic issues again. Right now I doordash for income which is going terrible because I‚Äôm having issues leaving my house with panic attacks. Thankfully my parents are helping me as much as they can as I have my own house, girlfriend, and 2 kids to look after.\n\nI am very much considering trying to go on disability so I have some type of income so I can focus solely on my mental health and trying to get better. The stress of bills and trying to make money makes it very difficult to heal myself and try to move past the trauma\n\nMy question to you guys is do you think it is okay to sign up for disability? Are there any medications that have helped you with panic attacks and physical anxiety symptoms with intrusive thoughts and constant ruminating? I‚Äôm currently not medicated which is probably making this a lot worse. Just any advice in general could help. Thank you! ",

    "title": "Trauma from long term relationship morphing with existing PTSD - I feel like I‚Äôm spiraling. ",
    "selftext": "Hello everyone, I very recently finally left a very toxic relationship. I was with this person for a few years and should‚Äôve left truthfully after the first few months. Me and this person were kind of on and off give or take every few months for about the first year and a half but once we were on again there wasn‚Äôt another off period until the recent official break up. I have 0 intention of ever going back to this person or even talking to them. Initially it felt so freeing to finally be away from this person. It was painful as well as I stayed due to holding onto the good moments in the relationship hoping more of those would come and there would one day be no more bad moments with this person. I had a major wake up call in an argument with this person that made me realize, this person is never changing and I need to get the heck out of here so I did. (I‚Äôm sorry for the vague information I‚Äôm scared to put too much information). Recently, in the heat of the moment of New Year‚Äôs Eve, I slept with a good friend of mine. I thought at first it was a good idea, it was fun I enjoyed it and it was keeping my mind off of the relationship I had left not too long before. Things were fine until immediately after. Like literally, we both got cleaned up and dressed and it hit me. I started to slowly have flashbacks of traumatic moments in the relationship i was in. Most in which i thought i forgot about. One of the biggest thing that keeps circling in my brain is, this recent ex instilled a deep anxiety in me regarding sex and STDs. I want to add, I am clean and have been tested throughout our relationship at my yearly appts. I had not done anything with my ex since about the beginning of 2024. My friend who I slept with is also clean (I‚Äôm not putting their sex history online but it had been a minute and they were tested as well, all clean). This ex basically made it seem like if I left and got with anyone else with my body count being (11) I was gonna get STDs because my body is ‚Äúworn down‚Äù. While I like to think I‚Äôm smart enough to know this is not at all how this works, my brain is a twisted mess and it‚Äôs creating narratives and anxieties over something super unrealistic. I want to add my ex‚Äôs body count is well over 20 and he was tested multiple times as well over the course of our relationship and he‚Äôs all negative. I was diagnosed with ptsd when I was 17 from previous SA and abuse. Over the years I‚Äôve had multiple other traumatic events that have added bits to my ptsd. And now here I have this multiple year relationship. In long short, I‚Äôm terrified my ptsd will make it hard for me to ever get into another relationship again or ever even have a sex life. My ex tore me down with my confidence during intimate moments and now I just feel like a walking blob. Sorry for the rant if you made it this far i appreciate you. If some of this doesn‚Äôt make 100% I‚Äôm sorry I woke up in the middle of the night from a flashback nightmare and I couldn‚Äôt go back to sleep. ",

    "title": "Getting ostracised in career because of PTSD",
    "selftext": "I just need to get this out of my system. Long story short I had trauma since I was around 6 years old, mum turned alcoholic, had behavioural problems through teens, have been very alone most of this process. Around 3 or 4 years ago started heavy-duty therapy to deal with all of this, and around August I finally started processing things that I went through. \n\nI want to be an opera singer. I‚Äôve been studying for around 7 years or so, and I‚Äôm very fortunate with the opportunities that have been given, but I knew from early on I would not have an easy ride to this career.\n\nAll throughout my undergrad I had severely low self esteem, and eventually made it so that my teachers told me I could never pursue this career. My voice was also very quiet, and I sounded very shy and, quite frankly, shit. If I were in their shoes I would have said the same to me, cause it did not sound like an amplified voice at all. I took a year break and had a major breakthrough. I had a better teacher during that time who was great, and I felt more confident in my abilities. By that point everyone knew I had mental health problems (I would almost constantly cry when things were bad)and I got quite frustrated with myself. I started therapy around this point, and after a year or so things were looking up.\n\nMy teacher recommended another teacher, and I had a trial lesson. We hit it off right away, but they were quite strong-headed. I wanted them to be my mentor because they said they related to how I felt, they were the same at my age. It was fine for a while, until I didn‚Äôt get into a programme I went for. They basically said I couldn‚Äôt be my authentic self because people don‚Äôt want to be around miserable people. I understand what they mean, but I read it as ‚Äòmy authentic self is wrong and I have to change that‚Äô. So I worked really hard for a year and a half to ‚Äòfix‚Äô the way people perceived me. I hardly cried, or if I did, it wasn‚Äôt as big of a deal. I thought I was finally getting somewhere, and I auditioned to the same programme again, and a couple of days beforehand, my teacher told me to say these specific things. I trusted her, but when it came to the interview (which she was on the board so she knew what questions we‚Äôre going to be asked) they wanted the exact opposite. I didn‚Äôt get in. I now realise, and have been validated by my partner (who‚Äôs also a singer) and colleagues of all ages that I was manipulated and kinda emotionally abused by her. Regardless, the people with the most important opinions don‚Äôt see it that way.\n\nA trusted person on the board later told me that they didn‚Äôt think I was strong enough to have a career in opera, and they didn‚Äôt choose me not because of my vocal ability (which I worked so hard on and I feel is definitely fit for the stage), but because they felt I couldn‚Äôt handle the stresses of the job. I was heartbroken. I still am.\n\nToday, I got a message from someone that a summer program that I auditioned for and got on the reserved list for (I‚Äôve been twice before, there are 2 people on reserves for each voice type) had a drop out and I was not the first pick of the reserves. I also have not been chosen to participate in an opera company that I‚Äôve been a part of for 10 years, and I just know this is all connected to the fact that my PTSD and my upbringing are the main factor. \n\nI‚Äôve never had a support person, except for my partner who I‚Äôve been with for 8 years. I don‚Äôt have money (was cut off completely by parents at around 17). Im just so scared that people will always think I‚Äôm too weak, that they won‚Äôt listen to what I have to say because of my ‚Äòproblems‚Äô. I‚Äôm so sad and disappointed and angry. I know I‚Äôm so fucking strong, and I know I know I have something to say with my voice. I just need to get out of my country and start fresh, but even so you need references to get in any young artist programme, and I‚Äôve got no one to turn to. I‚Äôm so mad that these are the cards I‚Äôve been dealt. I just want to tell my story to others, because I feel so misread and mistaken. I want people to know how many obstacles I have against me, I just want to scream from the rooftops that this isn‚Äôt my fault, and I‚Äôve been trying my hardest, and that I‚Äôm only human. But I‚Äôm so scared to alienate even more than I already have been. I dunno, what do I have to lose?",

    "title": "How to Help a Friend With PTSD ",
    "selftext": "TW: Very brief mentions of suicide,  sa, abuse, extreme violence, and drug abuse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI could have just as easily titled this 'Don't Believe These Stereotypes About PTSD' and some of this is veiled venting. I do have ptsd myself, but this would have read weird if I kept switching from third to first person and back.\n\n1. They Are All Different, Just Ask\n\nOne of the first steps to supporting a friend, partner, family member, etc. with ptsd is to ask them what you can do to support them. They are all different, and just going off to do research on your own can lead some people to jump to conclusions and cause misunderstandings and even sometimes hurt feelings. That doesn't mean learning about it from other sources is always a bad idea, but sometimes going directly to the person effected isn't sufficient, for example if someone just started developing ptsd or isn't even aware they have it yet they might not have the knowledge and experience to know what would help them best. They also might focus only on what you can do and leave out the warnings of what not to do. Honestly, that all goes for any condition, mental or otherwise, but someone with ptsd specifically might just say that there's nothing you can do for them due to the feelings of hopeless, confusion, and disconnection ptsd can cause. That isn't true, of course you should encourage them to seek professional help if they haven't already, (though do be gentle about it as some of them have bad experiences and even trauma from therapy) but there are things YOU can do to help someone with ptsd.\n\n2. Their Trauma Their Business\n\nDon't ask them what caused their trauma or assume that if they tell you about an event that might have been traumatic that must have been what caused them to develop ptsd. It's not important for you to know what happened in order to help them and it is private information. Some therapists don't ask traumatized people to share the details of their trauma for a long time because the distress of sharing those details too early can do more harm than good and even a lot of professional help can be done by focusing only on the responses to trauma. Some people have had others minimize their trauma as 'not bad enough' and sometimes it's just a long story or a long series of stories as it's not always 1 event that caused someone's ptsd. It's also possible that they went through one or more events that could be considered traumatic but did not develop ptsd from those experiences as going through something terrible does not mean you have ptsd, in fact of all the people that experience life threatening trauma only 1 out of 3 end up with ptsd, and some people have the symptoms of ptsd for a while (no longer than 6 months) after the traumatic event,  but don't end up developing ptsd.\n\n3. It WAS Bad Enough \n\nIt doesn't matter if you've been through much worse and think you're fine or what they've been through really does seem trivial, if they got ptsd from the experience clearly it was bad enough to them. There are people who have been through SA, life threatening abuse, murder attempts, etc. who still think their reaction is disproportionate and they don't deserve help, this particular feeling must be even deeper in the people who developed ptsd from years of bullying or emotional abuse. Saying someone's overreacting will not help them or change their reaction it will simply tell them you are not a safe person to be around and if it looks like they've 'stopped their whining' what's really happened is they are hiding any trauma and unpleasant feelings from you because in their mind you have let them know you don't care about their feelings anyway. It can even help them to say out loud that what they've been was very bad, it might help them to feel validated and blame themselves less. People with ptsd, especially the ones who were abused, have trouble trusting people and making and maintaining connections already, so an experience like that can be very destructive.\n\n4. They Are Not Just Stupid Now, But Could You \nDumb It Down Sometimes Anyways?\n\nSome lesser talked about symptoms of ptsd are trouble focusing and memory issues. This can lead to worse grades in school, performance at work, paying less attention in conversations and much more. It can also be one explanation for why ptsd tends to cause lack of interest in activities someone used to enjoy because something like watching TV might just be harder for someone to focus on now. People with adhd will probably relate to some of this and there is an overlap in symptoms and someone who was born with adhd's symptoms might be noticeably worse after developing ptsd.  It can be difficult, but please try to be patient if they seem like they aren't paying attention and keep forgetting important things, it's not by choice it's because they have to learn new ways of navigating the world and slowly resolve the underlying problems.\n\n5. PTSD Is Not a Disease, But It Is a Disability \n\nPhysical pain is also a common symptom of ptsd. There are some people who have ptsd from experiences with chronic pain,  but ptsd itself can cause headaches,  body aches, stomach problems, heaviness in their body's making it hard to move around and more. It's yet another fact about the condition that can make simply living life much more difficult and that's one reason helping someone with ptsd do chores can be helpful. It can also be tiring to have to explain over and over that what they have isn't going to spread to someone else and it can be embarrassing to admit they get so stressed out it effects how they feel physically. If it seems like they aren't doing much then try to understand and get them help with the actual problem instead of calling them lazy. If they tell you they are struggling with something because of their mental health,  remember they aren't just making excuses they are dealing with genuine disability that at times can be quite debilitating. Do you think you'd function just as well on no sleep and afraid to close your eyes?\n\n6. It's Not Contagious Unless It Is \n\nOf course, ptsd isn't literally contagious, but being around someone who is suffering constantly can cause your own mental health to suffer and someone who cares about you would feel guilty if their issues were causing you a lot of distress. It's great to want to help someone, but you can only do that if you look after yourself. If you need a break, take it, and don't let your worries about them take over your life. \n\n7. You're Not in Danger Unless You Are \n\nNot all mentally ill people or people with ptsd are dangerous or violent, and not all abuse victims end up as abusers themselves. Don't assume you are in danger, even though some actions can look scary from the outside. Everyone behaves differently during ptsd flashbacks and other mental breakdowns and some people get quiet and still, but some people can yell and self-harm during flashbacks and that can look very scary but does not mean that person would ever hurt anyone else, so don't assume they will.  That being said,  people with ptsd are not all saints either,  they are just as capable of harming others as anyone else,  just not more so, and there are some cases where people with ptsd are violent during ptsd flashbacks, which isn't in their control and therefore isn't their fault, but you still need to protect yourself and,  at the very least, remove yourself from the situation long enough for them to at least get better to the point where they don't do that anymore if that does happen. Let's not pretend that a condition known to cause irritability, anger, and a lack of control can't make some people act in harmful ways. Once again don't let their ptsd be contagious and spread to you, for many reasons,  but for one it would be extremely difficult to repair a relationship between an abuser with ptsd and their victim who they caused to have ptsd. It actually might be better for you both to keep your distance in those situations. Basically,  people with ptsd are just people,  not monsters, not angels,  just people who can be good, bad or anything in between. \n\n8. They're Not Weak, but They Sure Feel Like They Are\n\nRegardless of what the trauma was, traumatized people tend to blame themselves for what happened and never feel they are doing enough to move on and grow. Tell them out loud it isn't their fault and celebrate their small victories even if they won't. Flashbacks in particular can make them feel like they aren't making progress. Flashbacks are more than just a very bad memory,  in their head they are reexperiencing the trauma all over again,  they might even act it out and feel retraumatized afterwards, so it's important to minimize flashbacks and for them to do something to calm down after having one. Recognizing and avoiding triggers is one way to have less flashbacks. Being triggered isn't hearing something that makes you a bit uncomfortable,  it can send people into a full-blown mental breakdown or cause them to reexperience their trauma. What triggers someone isn't always obvious,  even though at times it can be, someone who was yelled at by an abuser might be triggered by yelling,  but it's possible for that same person to be triggered by silence or a certain smell or being touched unexpectedly or in a certain way. Flashbacks can be seriously damaging to someone's mental health and that's why it's best to avoid triggers, when possible, but because it isn't always possible sometimes, they will have to manage triggers. This means doing something to better tolerate a trigger like taking a deep breath or going to a different room. You can help them by observing what might trigger them,  not setting off their triggers, and if you notice they're are getting upset or notice that one of their known triggers is present then don't touch them as that might be startling or make the situation worse, but tell them in a soothing voice that they should take a deep breath,  or do whatever psychological exercise seems to work for them. \n\n9. Reach Out but Not Too Much \n\nThe treatment for ptsd is based on connection so it's important to reach out even if it doesn't seem like they are always reaching back. That being said they will need space sometimes as well. It is on them to tell you that they need space, don't just assume they do, but if they say it then please respect it and try not to take it personally, it's most likely not even about you anyway, they're probably just exhausted or need some time to themselves to process something.\n\n10. No, They Can't Help It\n\nDealing with any mental illness at least requires life adjustments and will usually require professional care, significant amounts of time, effort, and support, and may even require hospital visits and treatments from specialists and ptsd is no exception. Even if the problem is in someone's head it doesn't mean they can just mind over matter it away. So, if someone can't help screaming during flashbacks for example, then they really cannot stop themselves any more than someone could stop themselves from having a seizure. If you really must have physical proof than look at the brain scans of mentally ill people, they are different from the ones of mentally healthy people. If they say they can't do something they mean it is not possible, not just that they don't want to do it or that it is very difficult, but that it is actually impossible, even if it's not obvious to you why they can't do it.\n\n11. The Answer to New Risky Behavior is Harm Reduction\n\nNew risky behavior is any behavior that could lead to them being harmed in some way that they did not participate in, at least as much, before. That could be anything from risky and/or more frequent sex and drug use to crossing streets without looking or speeding more often. You can talk to them about possibly getting help to stop these behaviors, but they will need professional help to do so and will only be able to quit when they're ready. The focus should be on making sure they are as safe as they can be even if they participate in risky behavior, that's what harm reduction means. For example, \nit would be better to make sure someone is practicing safe sex rather than commenting how much more sex they're having now or make sure they are testing their drugs and/or using clean needles rather than immediately forcing them into recovery. A lot of new risky behaviors are also unhealthy coping mechanisms and they won't be able to get rid of unhealthy coping mechanisms without learning healthy ones that work for them.\n\nIt is possible for symptoms to improve if they get the proper care, but it's very possible that ptsd will be something they will have to deal with for the rest of their lives. They might not ever be the same, but you can help on their journey towards healing.",

Maybe it‚Äôs the childhood I never had that I‚Äôm mourning, or maybe the fact that I was unhappy, IDK. I‚Äôm not diagnosed with PTSD (however, my therapist suspects that I have it), but I am diagnosed with depression. Sadness and depression goes hand in hand, but for me this is another type of sadness. It‚Äôs not the numb sadness that comes with depression (but I still feel that as well), instead this is a new sadness that came along with the therapy. It feels like I‚Äôve lost something or that someone died.\n\nI had dinner with a friends family the other day, and the impression I got (a happy, normal and most importantly peaceful family), increased this feeling a lot. I had a massive panic attack the day after and didn‚Äôt know how to handle the feeling of devastation that I felt. That‚Äôs probably me overreacting a lot, but here we are.\n\nThis post is probably messy, I hope it makes sense to someone at least. I just wanted to ask if someone can relate. Maybe there is a more fitting subreddit for this, but I‚Äôm choosing to post it here since I wanna know if this could be a symptom of PTSD. Of course a Redditor can‚Äôt answer that for sure, but I hope you get the point.

But soon, things began to fall apart. The environment at my base (the airport where I worked) was incredibly toxic. The people there were rude and unwelcoming, making it difficult to form friendships. At the same time, I was in a relationship with a toxic boyfriend who constantly invaded my privacy due to his jealousy. He insisted on picking me up from work because there was no public transportation nearby, and I had no other choice. Every time I spoke to colleagues, he would interrogate me about who they were. His psychological abuse wore me down. Saying \"no\" to him often led to dramatic, exhausting confrontations, so I avoided it whenever I could. Eventually, I became pregnant. Even then, he continued to scream at and manipulate me. At just six weeks, I suffered a miscarriage. They put me in a hospital with women who were there to give birth, so I was listening them to have cute talks with their husbands about their babies, and I was there in a lake of blood crying.  In the same devastating period, I lost my dream job as well. From there, life only seemed to get harder. I desperately wanted to return to flying, but every airline I applied to rejected me. I attended several open days, where I was given false hope, only to be let down after waiting weeks for a response. During this time, I met someone new. We spent some time together, and he texted me every day at first. But when I told him I was quitting smoking, his response showed his self-centeredness‚Äîhe immediately turned the conversation back to himself. The dynamic quickly became forced, and after a few days, he left me on read, and that was the end of it. From my past relationship, I‚Äôve also developed an aversion to physical touch‚Äîbeing hugged or kissed makes me uncomfortable. This has made me seem distant and cold to others, even though I don‚Äôt want to be. I feel like my life has come to a standstill, like there‚Äôs no hope left.

Im struggling so hard it makes me cry and it‚Äôs a crazy cycle. I feel like Im triggering myself sometimes, when I don‚Äôt know what to do then i think what would he do. Idk journaling seems to be helping me more lately. ",

    "title": "Cancer survivor; discovered a rare trigger today (TW: mild suicidal ideation, medical stuff) ",
    "selftext": "So for context I (23NB), was diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer when I was 18 years old. To top it off this was in 2020 when the COVID pandemic was going on and I was immunocompromised due to the chemo so the whole thing was a lot scarier due to that. I took a gap year in my education 2020-2021 to go through 9 rounds of chemo, two surgeries, and over 7 weeks of radiation therapy. After my chemo was extended in Nov ‚Äò20 my mental health took a sharp nosedive and for a couple months or so I wound up in the worst mental and emotional state of my life because I felt completely hopeless that I would get better and I got to a point where I really wanted to die. But treatment did eventually end and I slowly got better mentally and emotionally. I had a small recurrence in 2022-23 that didn‚Äôt need chemo to treat and I have been NED ever since. \n\nI am a much happier person now and I‚Äôm glad I survived, but pretty much every single day I remember my experience with cancer and how it could come back at any time and wreck havoc on my life and my plans like it did back then. It‚Äôs something I‚Äôve mostly accepted and grown used to. It sucks, but those are the cards I‚Äôve been dealt and I try not to let it get to me too much. \n\nMy therapist (60sF) who I‚Äôve been seeing since the end of my treatment in 2021 is also a breast cancer survivor and we bonded a bit over that. I had a zoom appointment with her today and she told me that she‚Äôs had a small recurrence that might require chemotherapy to treat. She seems pretty sure of her survival and didn‚Äôt even seem upset at the thought of losing her hair when I suggested making a wig out of it. I wished her all the best and I plan on checking up with her soon. \n\nFor a couple hours after the appointment I just relaxed in my room but then out of nowhere it really just hit me and I had a meltdown I guess. It kinda feels selfish but I started to really freak out about the chances of my own recurrence. It was like in my mind I was going over the same thoughts I go through over and over again every single day but with these deep feeling of helplessness, fear, terror, anxiety, and despair. \n\nI just got a PET scan a few weeks ago and it came back completely clean but during my meltdown it felt like I had just been told I had another recurrence. I just had these horrible feelings in my gut and tears just kept flowing out of my eyes like a drippy faucet. I haven‚Äôt had a genuine freak out moment about just the POSSIBILITY of a cancer recurrence in a long time. Then I remembered that something similar happened in 2021 when I was finishing up treatment and my friend J had a recurrence of his leukemia (he‚Äôs healthy now). I remember when he told me I wished him the best obviously but just felt this deep sense of anxiety and helplessness about my own chance of recurrence. \n\nI kinda realized that, at least in my eyes, this fit the bill for a trauma trigger, and I don‚Äôt use that term lightly. I almost never get triggered like that. Other than the two times mentioned above I remember during my recurrence my docs put me on some new pills to treat it but when I got them in the mail they were in this big ziploc bag labeled ‚Äúchemotherapy‚Äù with a biohazard symbol on it. It really freaked me out as it looked just like the bag my epirubicen syringes were in when I got my first chemo infusion. This made me feel scared and helpless but instead of melting down I went on a spending spree and bought over $100 worth of edibles (its legal where I live) in a sort of ‚Äúwell I might be fucked let‚Äôs live it up while I can‚Äù attitude. Then there was the time just about a year ago when I got my annual mammogram and they thought I might have had fat necrosis (I didn‚Äôt) so they scheduled an emergency breast ultrasound for me; when I was in the waiting room all alone I freaked out enough to kinda forget that fat necrosis isn‚Äôt cancer and then I literally felt my emotions just turn off. It was like I knew panicking was pointless and I barely felt any emotions at all in a sort of ‚Äúlet‚Äôs get this shit done‚Äù attitude and then after the ultrasound when I got the all clear my emotions came back and I just felt exhausted and relieved but mostly exhausted and a bit annoyed. \n\nI guess the proximity and tangible reality of the possibility of a recurrence or chemotherapy is what triggers me. I get monthly injections in my belly to prevent a recurrence and I don‚Äôt get triggered there. When I get blood draws or scans I don‚Äôt get triggered there. I never really thought of triggers with regards to my PTSD before today because it almost never happens to me. \n\nMy mom came home during my meltdown today and I tried to calm myself down but eventually let her in and we talked it out. I guess I‚Äôm still a bit freaked but I‚Äôm feeling better than earlier. \n\nI guess I‚Äôm wondering what I should do if/when I get triggered like this again. Any advice or tips? I‚Äôm also very open to answering questions or providing more context for my experiences if wanted/needed. ",

Not like \"I have no friends\" empty or \"I'm estranged from my family\" or \"I have no value and cannot be loved\"; I mean, wherever you go to stitch together the memories that make you who you are and you realize there are these holes, blacker than black, the expanses of which stretch into the past by measures far greater than the actual time elapsed between the shore you embarked from to the shore you find yourself on. You might cross them in the mere instant of passing through a door, or you might find many small voids suddenly coalescing into a years-long sprawl with your existence all this time now just islands in the nothing.\n\nI don't know if I'm making any sense. I don't even think I should be talking about any of this. I already don't want it to be real, but it's the only thing I see that no one else can and it's very, very hard to describe what it is and what it's doing to me. I'm already falling apart as a person, but I can't give up, not while my wife is with me, the one person who I will never be able to do without. I could shut off everything except incidental human contact and be okay if it meant still that I would get to be with her every day.\n\nI'm getting off topic. \n\nOver the last four years, I've had floor therapists retire. I've had two psychiatrists retire; I've had one psychiatrist closed off to me by their corporate overlords because I lost my Medicaid and got backbilled a few hundred dollars I cannot afford, and I've rejected two psychiatrists for being wildly out-of-touch. Then there's retired oral surgeons (I need all my teeth replaced), two retired neurosurgeons (who said surgery for the problem with my spinal cord is so high risk for complications they would only do it in an emergency situation), and retired general practice. \n\nI can't find any escape. I need to dissociate HARD. I'm fact, if I could dissociate and give someone else control of this body and all my memories and personality, they could have it. I can't find escape in the things I once loved. I gave up TV and film ages ago. Reddit is the last patch of social media I use, and I've already blocked all notifications so it's only a matter of time until it will be the last time I remember to open this app. YouTube is in the same situation. If not those, what do I have left but my games‚Äîmore to the point, my semi-interactive fictions, though a game of Balatro or Civ can hardly be called literature. It's so hard to find good stuff to play, and so much of the good stuff anyway just reminds me of how big those voids are getting with every one of them I finish. Some days, I can't decide if it's time to do little more than wake up, eat, interact with my wife when she wants, but otherwise just do nothing I am not compelled to do. Laying awake, in bed, head empty, basically catatonic, empty. Capable, but empty. A rich internal life, but empty. Friendly, empathetic, real, emotive, genuine, but empty.\n",

I am still a virgin but I have been terrified of sex my whole life. And it has kind of been wavering with my fiance. \n\nI literally can‚Äôt be fingered because it triggers me so bad. My fiance can‚Äôt even play with my breasts without me having flashbacks and my whole body shutting down because I have so much shame and guilt flood through my body. I have so much pent up resentment because of them. Also, I have so much fear and anxiety that my fiance is only with me because of sex (when I know logically it‚Äôs not true because we‚Äôre waiting to actually have sex until we‚Äôre married bc we‚Äôre both virgins) and everytime I get triggered by him showing me his dick or him asking me if he could see my boobs immediately gives me serious flashbacks from my teenage years where I would do it for men but then they would leave. and I have serious abandonment trauma anyways. \n\nMy fiance knows all of this stuff and it‚Äôs so hard sometimes. I love him with all my heart and soul and he is so wonderful and patient. He is constantly trying to help me feel safe and never pushes me to do anything. And assures me that even if we can‚Äôt have sex because of my ptsd that he would stay with me. (He is a literal GEM) \n\nI just feel so much guilt, shame, and unworthiness. I am in a trauma therapy but my body will not let me open up and process it. It‚Äôs been really hard trying to deal with these things. Sexual trauma isn‚Äôt the only thing I have, along with PTSD, I have anxiety, OCD, and ADHD. I just need advice.\n\nIs there anything I can do to work on that trust with my fiance and help myself work through these things? Is exposing myself to doing sexually intimate things with my partner making it worse? Because when I am not triggers I love being intimate with him but when I am triggered (80% of the time) it just ruins it. Ugh I‚Äôm just frustrated and idk what to do. \n\nSorry for the long post.

They are convinced that I'm not trying hard enough, in my dad's words \"you're making yourself depressed and you're addicted to misery\". What I went through destroyed me and my body was affected badly as well as my mind. I don't know what to do or how I can work my way out of this. Can someone give me advice",

My counselor was ofc upset by this response and redirected me to another clinic where I was met with understanding and amazing worker's who took my condition seriously. I was signed up for a trauma focused CBT treatment that started in early spring. I spent 1-1,5 hours there every week for months. It was hard, a lot of times I had to force myself to go there, but I went. My therapist said early on that the goal is not to completely get rid of my PTSD since it did not seem attainable but rather to make the symptoms more manageable and to make me feel like I had controll of my life. She said that I will still choose to not do certain things but it is important that that is my decision to make, not the decision of my condition.\n\nIt helped me to understand how some of my behaviours are connected and how I can overcome them.

I just don‚Äôt talk about this stuff and I suppose telling it to internet strangers might help me digest it. \n\nI have been a career firefighter/paramedic for 9 years. Love the job but it‚Äôs come with a cost. Lots of bad calls just start stacking up. Intrusive ‚Äúmemories‚Äù like flashes of scenes or details. I am great at my job and excel on those ‚Äúbad calls‚Äù but afterwards, sometimes months or years later they hit me. My body and mind seem to reject them. The memories are altered. Like they have been redacted. The most obvious and weird part is all of the faces are blurred. I can see the bodies, clothes, scene. I can see what I did (treatment wise) but the face is always blurred. I wouldn‚Äôt recognize any of them if they were sitting in my living room. \n\nI avoid talking about bad calls. I just shake off the intrusive ‚Äúscreenshots‚Äù that pop up. But if I can‚Äôt immediately shake it off my heart starts to beat harder and faster, my body starts to shake, jaw tensed. It‚Äôs not like a bad feeling. I feel like I‚Äôm thinking faster, smarter, more observant. Like I‚Äôm ready to do work. But it‚Äôs exhausting. Because once I reach that heightened state. I‚Äôll be there all day, then not be able to sleep. \n\nSleep. I can‚Äôt sleep. I‚Äôll lay in bed just wide awake. I‚Äôve turned to alcohol for sleep.

Waiting for something to go wrong so I can go to work. \n\nI also fought in Afghanistan 2008-2010. I was infantry and got my fair share of ‚Äúaction.‚Äù I came back a little fucked up but pushed forward. Now I can‚Äôt even begin to go back into those memories without going into that heightened arousal state, then subsequently use alcohol to bring me down. I‚Äôve done my best to leave that part of my life behind me and not ‚Äúreminisce.‚Äù\n\nA guy from the unit I was with wrote a book. ‚ÄúDamn the valley‚Äù I bought it and it‚Äôs been sitting on my shelf for two years.

    "selftext": "This might be long... but thank you for reading anyway.\n\nOn November 4th, I had the worst panic attack of my life. I thought I was going to die. Since the beginning of October 2024, I had been seeking professional help due to a relapse of my depression and anxiety, caused by PTSD that was triggered when I had to get on a plane.\n\nI‚Äôm not from here, I‚Äôm from another country. I had already received psychological help before, and I was able to improve a lot, get stronger, and move forward, of course with the help of a psychologist and anxiety medication.\n\nI ended up seeking professional help here in the United States. I went to the local mental health center in the city I‚Äôm living in, it‚Äôs free. I managed to get them to prescribe me medication (even though I feel like they never really properly evaluated me to give me the right medicine). They gave me medication for anxiety and depression.\n\nThe thing is, everything changed on November 4th, 2024. That day, I was fine, I had a lot of things to do, and I was feeling okay, with a little anxiety, so I decided to take my anxiety pill (which I had only taken once before, this would be the second time) and it caused the worst effect instead of calming me down. I felt like I had lost my mind. My boyfriend wasn‚Äôt home, only my roommate was there. I called my boyfriend to come home because I couldn‚Äôt calm down. I started screaming with all my strength, I lost the strength in my body, I was falling, and I could only scream. I started twitching in painful ways, I really thought I was going to die. My boyfriend ended up calling 911 because he got scared. When they arrived at the house, not only the ambulance came but also the police. Imagine a person having a horrible panic attack, with police and paramedics in their living room, in their safe space. I couldn‚Äôt calm down, seeing them and them cornering me made me feel so sick. They took my blood pressure and temperature. They said I had a fever and needed to go to the hospital to rule out an allergic reaction to the medication I had taken. That was from the paramedic, who was quite sweet and helpful. They asked me to go in the ambulance with my boyfriend, but I just couldn‚Äôt move, I was so scared to go with them. So that‚Äôs when the police intervened and told me that I had to go or ‚Äúthings were going to get worse.‚Äù I wanted to go but mentally I just couldn‚Äôt, and my body was flooded with panic. Since I didn‚Äôt comply, the police forced me onto the sofa, hurting me physically while handcuffing me. I screamed in pain and fear, I never thought something like this would happen to me. My panic was beyond the sky, it was uncontrollable at this point. With my hands handcuffed, they took me to the police car, barefoot because they didn‚Äôt let me find my shoes. I screamed, I cried, I begged them not to make me do this. The police officer just told me to shut up and started driving at high speed down the highway. We got to the hospital, and I entered, barefoot, handcuffed, screaming, and crying. Everything hurt. They took me to a room and handcuffed me to the bed. The nurses mocked me and told me to be quiet. They didn‚Äôt want to give me water. One nurse came with a glass, a mocking face, and told me, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll only give you water if you stop crying.‚Äù It was so humiliating. They kept me in the hospital for 9 hours, not telling me anything. They took off the handcuffs because ‚ÄúI was behaving.‚Äù I was just crying. Later, I got to see my boyfriend, and then I called my family, who were worried in another country, thinking the worst had happened to their daughter. I left the hospital 9 hours later, with a police officer saying, ‚ÄúYeah, sorry, it was all a misunderstanding, you can go now.‚Äù\n\nI never felt so humiliated in my life. Now my nervous system is completely messed up. I have trauma from that. Since that day, I‚Äôve been in fight or flight mode. The therapist I sought here simply didn‚Äôt help, and neither did the psychiatrist. I‚Äôm dealing with so much anxiety every day, I‚Äôm having a lot of relapses, and it‚Äôs becoming really hard to move forward. I haven‚Äôt gone out with my friends in months, and this is becoming difficult to handle.\n\nI just wanted to vent. I hope this doesn‚Äôt happen to anyone else, and that they train the police in this country better to learn how to handle panic attacks or anything related to mental health.\n\n",

But I started hearing explosions in the distance and people yelling and I don‚Äôt know why, but I stayed.

Then after it was all over, we took a head count, nobody was injured and we continued our work day. \n\nBut nowadays whenever I think of that, I get emotional, I feel scared, weak and just less of a person. I think about how my friends would‚Äôve seen me if I would‚Äôve been killed. It‚Äôs even worse when I think about my mom seeing me like that. In a casket with an American flag over me.

    "selftext": "I am a 14 year old boy and today, while trying a recipe, I started a grease fire. The recipe I had in mind included some hot oil and, having never experimented extensively with it, I never knew how to handle it. I researched sunflower oil's boiling point and, without further a doubt, I turned the stove on and waited for it to heat up. Now, oil doesn't react to heat as water does, and it's very hard to see the signs of overheating. \n\nThe last red flag I should've seen was the oil producing smoke and smelling burnt, right before the inevitable flame started. I was at all times near the stove and when I saw the fire starting, I got immediately weak and overwhelmed. It was like watching a fiasco starting to happen and having to stop it ASAP. \n\nNow, I was informed about grease fires and how if water is thrown on them they immediately expand, so I quickly took a bowl and placed it over the fire, after which I quickly turned the heat off. The scariest part of this is I was alone, my parents away for 2 days and having to handle the fire all by myself. Images of it expanding and wrecking down my house were flying across my head as I closed the window and door of the kitchen so oxygen wouldn't circulate and fuel the fire. I tried switching the bowl on top of the kettle with the fire to a lid, but immediately after I took the bowl off the oil caught fire again, even more intensely. The fire kept going under my bowl and getting stronger, then weaker, then stronger again. I was terrified.\n\n  \nThe fire got pretty darn big, but I managed to suffocate it. The questions left were... What would've happened if a week previously I wouldn't have watched some insignificant Youtube video about grease fires and the dangers they behold? What if I would've thrown water on the fire, unknowingly, and expand the fire? I got 2 burns on my hand, but what if I wouldn't have known how to settle the fire? What if this fire would've ended my life horrifically?\n\n  \nNow, at night, I struggle to sleep while looking through other fire stories. I know my incident isn't nearly as overwhelming as others -- heck, my fire was around the height of an average arm, but I am still unable to sleep. I feel the smoke again, how I felt when I saw the flame and how I felt knowing the fire may start again, or the bowl might break which would make the oil fire spill across the floor. I feel like at any moment, somewhere in my house, a fire could start, I imagine how my whole building is engulfed in flames and I am left surrounded in them, basically just worrying about how the situation could derail, only having not had the information about grease fires. Perhaps, a decision of reading an article one month ago is what saved my life now.\n\nPSA: My parents DO know about the incident I had.\n\nI want to hear more fire survivor stories and how you got over the trauma of it. Thanks!",

I usually am very private and secretive about my PTSD, my best friend is the only other person who is aware of it, and I'm generally a pretty emotionally guarded person. Lately I've been trying to push myself to be more open and communicative about my emotions because I feel like that emotional avoidance is usually what pushes me to feel self isloated and lonely, and is often the downfall in my relationships.My boyfriend and I have been dating for about 3 months now, he has mental health issues of his own and we've been able to help each other open up in ways we haven't in other relationships and we have a strong mutual understanding that I haven't felt with another partner before. \n\nSo instead of my usual self isolating in this situation I texted my boyfriend and asked him if I could crash at his place for the night because I was freaking out a little going to sleep and thought it would help if I had another person in the room with me. When I got to his place he started offering solutions to help me sleep but I explained to him that I have PTSD and that I probably got triggered by something earlier in the day that made my fight or flight react and that j just needed to calm my anxiety and my heart rate. He didn't seem phased or reactive at all when I opened up, instead he tried to accommodate me as best he could, invited me on an outing with his friends for the next night, told me he loved me, and checked on me intermittently. Writing it all out now is making me realize that it's probably not as big a deal as I'm making it out to be, but I can't help feeling stupid, ashamed, and guilty for telling him that I have PTSD. I'm second-guessing if telling him was the right thing to do.\n\nI've noticed a lot of posts of other people with PTSD/cptsd saying that it's better off to never tell anyone about their condition, and that no one really needs to know because they'll never understand. But honestly I feel like the opposite is true, I think if you want a healthy long-term relationship with someone you should put everything out on the table and communicate, but on the other hand I still feel very anxious about the entire night.

But I didn‚Äôt want my baby to die. I got pregnant at 14 from rape. I had already been raped and abused multiple times in my life. And this time I was humiliated online because my rapist filmed and took pictures. And posted them and sold them online. \n\nThe police didn‚Äôt do anything. So a few weeks after the rape I tried to kill myself and was in a coma for a day. After I got released from hospital I was still suicidal. So I was drinking and doing drugs to cope. For months but a started to gain weight rapidly and get sickness and cravings and stuff and I was worried. I looked pregnant too. I was in denial though. My whole life I wanted to one day have a big family with lots of children. But like WAY in the future.\n\nI was scared of taking a pregnancy test because I didn‚Äôt want it to be true. But I did stop hurting myself and doing drugs incase I was pregnant because I didn‚Äôt want hurt my baby if I was pregnant. I was so scared of my family and friends disowning me I didn‚Äôt tell anyone about my fear of being pregnant. I wasn‚Äôt allowed out of the house on my own because of the suicide attempt. So I didn‚Äôt want to have to ask my family and I was scared if I‚Äôd ask the GP they‚Äôd have to tell my parents.\n\nA few more months went by and I started to accept it. And I decided I was going to take a pregnancy test. Because my parents allowed me to go to town with my friend in a week from when I decided to take the test. I decided I was going to steal a pregnancy test without her noticing while we went shopping. And I honestly started to in a maybe messed up way love my child. I thought it was a sign I needed to get better. And stay alive. So I could give my baby a good life. \n\nI knew it was going to be hard but I also thought it would be worth it. And I started thinking about names and looking at baby clothes and saving money up. I for some reason decided I didn‚Äôt want an abortion at this point. And I didn‚Äôt want to have to give up my baby so I was going to keep it and I felt comforted knowing I would have someone who needs me. Which I know isn‚Äôt the way to go about having a baby but I genuinely thought the universe was giving me this child so I‚Äôd turn my life around and all my problems will be solved. \n\nBut then a few days before meeting my friend I started my period again. I was in extreme agony and within seconds the blood had already soaked through my underwear and my bed. And I was screaming in pain. My parents thought it was just a really heavy period and my mother gave me these really thick pads she uses when she has her period. And I was telling her I don‚Äôt think this is normal and she said it happens to her sometimes when she has a heavy period and she gave me paracetamol. I ended up crawling because I felt really faint and in pain and couldn‚Äôt walk to the bathroom to put on the pad but threw up when I got there. Then I was putting on the pad and the deformed baby came out. Like it was a fully formed feetus but in peices. I could make out its and hands and feet and head. And I started sobbing. \n\nI felt like it was all my fault. And I still do. I shouldn‚Äôt have done drugs or alcohol or tried to kill myself then my baby would‚Äôve lived. And it was pretty far along so it might‚Äôve felt the pain by that point. \n\nI‚Äôm not against abortion I was considering abortion but I had chosen to have this baby. Now I have fertility issues and will probably never be able to have a baby. And even if I could I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be mentally able to. After the miscarriage I went back to my old ways of drinking and doing drugs. And trying to kill myself. The baby was what I changed for. Yet that still wasn‚Äôt good enough. ",

    "title": "What happened at the shelter (CW: severe animal abuse)",
    "selftext": "Hey guys, so it‚Äôs a little hard to talk about but I wanted to write a bit about a traumatic experience I had in the past, as well as the effects its had on my mental health. I figured this was the best place to talk about it since it‚Äôs a really difficult situation to explain to anyone who hasn‚Äôt gone through a similar experience. I also find it really hard to actually verbalize rather than just writing it out.\n\nThis happened a few years ago, the summer before my freshman year of high school. I had one of my really good friends who was a few years older than me come out to visit family for the summer, and we decided to get volunteer jobs together. We went to this animal shelter a little bit out of town to find work, and we were gladly accepted since they were severely understaffed. \n\nThe shelter was‚Ä¶ terrible to say the least? It‚Äôs hard to actually describe it in words, verbal or otherwise, as it‚Äôs such a visceral memory. Firstly, it was filthy. I don‚Äôt even think the word filthy even describes it accurately, its was decrepit and so vile that even remembering some of the things I saw make me ill. There was rotting food and maggots everywhere, pretty much every kind of excrement all over the floor, mold on the ceiling and walls, just to name a few things. This isn‚Äôt even to mention the overcrowding, this shelter was taking in at least 3x the amount of animals as it should be.\n\nWe were repulsed. Soon after, we found out that the shelter was being ran and almost exclusively care-taken by only one old woman. This lady was insane, theres no kinder way to put it. She was an old polish lady (and was also an ex navy seal instructor if i‚Äôm remembering correctly???) She lived out of the office at the shelter and slept on a lice infested futon. She used to scream at us for what gelt like hours, berating us for anything from using the wrong setting on the washing machine to taking too long of water breaks (mind you we were trapped in an unventilated acrid room in the middle of summer in the tropics). One memory of mine involves her forcing me to hold a door shut while several aggressive, large dogs were growling at me to let them out. My friend also recalls a time when she was forced to bury 2 dead kittens out in the front yard.\n\nI don‚Äôt know why I didn‚Äôt quit, or call animal control or something. I think I felt like I was making a difference, and I was scared of what would happen if I left. I worked mainly with the cats, and when I would take even just one day off the room would be trashed. Plus, the shelter was apparently in the middle of relocating to a different town, so I think I thought it would get better after moving and gaining some more employees. For some sick reason I felt like it was my responsibility to be a caretaker to all of these animals, like I was the only one keeping them from living in revulsion.\n\nAnyways, I stopped working there my first week of freshman year and I thought that the whole ordeal was over, that I had made a difference with the work that I did and that was that. \n\nOn the Wednesday of that week, about midnight, I woke up to my mom pulling me out of bed.\nMy boss had killed herself and left all the animals alone without food and water for a whole week. In the middle of summer. \n\nI was so so devastated, I can barely describe the way I felt in that moment. I ended up having to testify to the police and draw them a map of the shelter since they didn‚Äôt know what to expect when they went in there. My mom, trying to be a martyr as per the usual, insisted that she brought over dog food to the animals at the shelter. I told her not to go, since it was a crime scene, and I couldn‚Äôt stress enough the things that she was about to walk into. Also it was dangerous. A bunch of animals who hadn‚Äôt had anything to eat for a week except for each other, can you imagine? Still, despite my begging she still left. I‚Äôll never forget the feeling of sitting on my couch bawling my eyes out thinking that I had failed those poor babies. \n\nThats what hit me the hardest, was the guilt about how I could have stopped it all from happening. I forgot to mention it before, but my boss was always talking about how she was going to kill herself, and in retrospect I always felt like I could‚Äôve stopped her from doing what she did too. \n\nI didn‚Äôt tell very many people about what happened, it would be too difficult to explain even if I wanted to. I still have only told my closest friends and my therapist about everything, and I doubt many others will get to hear about it straight from my mouth. Did you know my mom had actually forgotten that all of this happened to me? I brought it up in conversation and she was like ‚Äúoh I forgot that your boss killed herself‚Äù like what?????\n\nI struggled really hard after it happened, I wasn‚Äôt able to drive past the shelter without physically gagging or throwing up in my mouth. I still have a very hard time with certain things, especially things like noises or smells. I used to work at a florist, and pretty much had to quit because our backrooms reminded me too much of the shelter. Certain acrid smells make me freak out, along with certain noises like dogs barking. I just recently adopted a kitten to help me cope with some of the things going on in my life (his name is spider, he‚Äôs a little tuxedo cat‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs sitting on too of me right now while im writing this üê±), and I found it so incredibly difficult to clean his litter box without thinking about the shelter. I was also having bad nightmares about everything for a while, but then I started a new medication which made them stop.\n\nAnyways, thank you for reading this if you made it this far. I know it‚Äôs a pretty unusual story, and theres a lot more I could go into about the whole situation. If anyone has any advice on coping with traumatic experiences, or even just any comments I would be happen to hear them. I hope you have a great day!! ",

And counterintuitively, how greedy it makes you feel towards keeping that trauma, holding onto it even though it makes you feel awful, changes you into a monster, wracks your mental health to the edge and then shoves it over.\n\nHell, look at Smeagol/Gollum.  If he isn't a prime example of self-isolation, I don't know what is!  And he stopped at nothing, chasing that dragon of despair and awfulness.\n\nIdk, maybe I'm reading too much into it.

    "selftext": "So, long story short, I randomly got what I think is a memory to being SA'd by a family member when I was very young at a family reuinion, but I don't know if it's real or just my mind making things up. \nI got this \"memory\" about 2-3 years ago because I was watching a video about something similar. During the video I just suddenly got extremely uncomfortable and started crying and felt panicky and I didn't understand why until I suddenly had that memory. Before that I remembered a lot of things about that family reunion except the memories just cut off after a certain point during the reunion. I never really thought about that but it makes sense as I was about 4 or 5 at that time and all my memories of back then are hazy.\nBut I still have doubts the memory is even real. Did nobody see it happen when there were tons of people at the house? We were outside but wouldn't I have told someone? Maybe not as I barely tell anyone even now, but wouldn't I have not understood and told someone? The actions that they made me do don't make me uncomfortable at all when I consent to them now, shouldn't it? The feeling I get when I see certain things or hear about certain things (kids being SA'd or family members SAing each other) is far different that normal discomfort, but it's not like every time I hear that stuff I have a panic attack. But sometimes when I hear that stuff I just feel scared and want to cry. Maybe that never happened at all though and I just made it up because I wanted something wrong with me. I know I used to want something wrong with me because people caring for me felt good, but then again I don't tell anybody about it really. I'm perfectly fine with sex and even have been hypersexual a lot of my life (especially as a kid) but I guess it can make me really uncomfortable sometimes and I can even be disgusted by sex sometimes. \nIs this kinda stuff normal to experience with PTSD? I don't get nightmares, and if those spells of being really uncomfortable and crying and kinda dissociating (sometimes to the point I will change personality entirely and feel like I'm watching myself from outside my body while someone else controls it until I feel comfortable again, but that's really rare for me) count as panic attacks they're not super dramatic like a lot of panic attacks I see are. Things related to my trauma don't make me panic but they can do that uncomfortable thing I was just talking about, but only occasionally. Maybe that's just because it was so long ago? I don't know. I have no proof this memory even happened and I feel like I had no recollection of it before I got it, so maybe it didn't happen and my brain is lying to me, but maybe thinking its a lie is also a way of coping. I'm not sure. Does this even sound like PTSD?",

    "selftext": "im so tired of nothing making sense anymore.\n\nthere's so much wrong with my family, but my immediate family is probably the least messed up. it just feels like everything is one hit after another in my life most of the time and i dont know how to deal with it being slightly more stable right now.\n\nin the past 4 years ive moved between my mom and dad's houses 4 times, 2 of which was because i was kicked out and made to live with the other parent for various reasons.\n\nwhen i was 13 it was because i came to the realization that im not cis and would rather be a boy than a girl most of the time, im still trying to figure out what exactly i am, but ive figured out that much. my mom found out, had a temper tantrum, told me she \"wouldnt trade her daughter for a son\" and that \"im a girl, so i better start acting like it\". she locked me in the car after we dropped my sister off at school and yelled awful things at me the whole drive home. she told me that im sick in the head, should be locked in a mental hospital, that she didnt raise a \"disgusting transexual deviant\", and how people like me shouldnt be allowed to live. she kept me locked in the car an additional 10 minutes after we got home and continued to scream at me. when she finally unlocked the door, i flung myself out of the car, ran inside, and sat in a burning hot shower. im not very religious, but that day i remember praying through my tears, sobbing to any god that was out there that would listen to me to please make it all a bad dream; to just let me wake up in my bed and realize it was all an awful nightmare that didnt actually happen.\n\ni was made to live with my dad after that.\n\nwhen i was 15 i was kicked out of my dad's house after he looked at my search history and saw me looking up the process of emancipation and looking into HRT. i had come out to my dad that summer when i was 14, and he didnt have a particularly supportive reaction. he told me that he doesnt believe i actually want to be a boy, but that i think it would make my life easier and that im doing it to be different. as if i would want to be part of one of the most targeted communities in the american south to \"make my life easier\". makes absolutely no sense. the whole reason i was looking into emancipation was because i saw a news article about it. the idea that i might try going for it was there in the back of my head, but it wasnt an active plan. me and my dad spent most of our time arguing. we'd get into fights about things that werent important, and he would yell and scream at me. sometimes i would threaten to call CPS, because a few testimonies from me and he'd never see his kids again. a couple of times my 5 year old brother stood between us and told him to leave me alone and that if our dad hurt me, he would hurt him.\n\na week before my baby brother's 4th birthday one summer when i was living with my dad, my grandpa burst into the living room yelling at me to stop being such a fuck up and actually be apart of the fucking family. that if i would just act right we wouldnt have any of the problems we were dealing with at the time, and that i was being disgracful.\n\ni had told my dad about it when i got home, and he apparently told his dad to knock it off, but left me to believe he didnt care and never told me he handled it. then it was somehow my fault for not talking to my dad or grandpa unless i had to for a few weeks.\n\nevery time me and my dad would argue, he would throw the fact that he married my mom and adopted me when i was a baby in my face. i hated it, still do. im not even allowed to look at my DNA test results because it makes HIM uncomfortable, even though we havent spoken in half a year.\n\nim back to living with my mom now, because my dad told her that he was done with me and couldnt deal with me anymore. she ignores me not being cis, pretends that im her sweet little girl and her precious daughter. at this point ive learned to just hide the discomfort when she calls me that and try and keep myself from physically cringing. she lets me wear mens clothes and use mens products as long as i dont say i would rather be a boy, so theres no sense in complaining.\n\ni had tried to see my dad over the summer, i really had. i made it a week before we got into a screaming match. he yelled at me over mens bodywash, and escalated the situation to saying that im a disrespectful, manipulative, pathological liar of a brat that twists the narrative of anything to victimize myself. all i do is tell it like it happened with the information i have if someone asks.\n\ni was fully expecting to be kicked out and homeless by now, because i havent managed to stay with one parent more than a year at this point. fortunately, i wasnt, because i dont have much, let alone the means to support myself, im only making 100 bucks per paycheck right now.\n\ni had a major problem with my old math teacher at the beginning of the school year before i transferred classes. she yelled at my whole class and called us idiots and said we were all dumber than 6th graders, in a fucking algebra 2 class. the yelling made me have a flashback, and i had a panic attack in class. my poor friend, alex, was trying to help me, but i couldnt register that it was him. i thought he was my dad and i started crying before he managed to help me realize where i was.\n\nmy mom had me switched out of her class.\n\ni was harassed by a boy in my ag class at the beginning of the school year. its not the first time ive been harassed by someone, but it made me scared to walk to class alone, because his friends would yell after me asking why i didnt like him. it wasnt even full blown sexual harassment, he just wouldnt leave me alone depite me being obviously uncomfortable.\n\none of my friends found out about it after he quit bothering me for the most part, and he keeps telling me to let him know if he ever starts it up again any time this kid says anything to me, since he sits on the opposite side of my friend to me in my ag class.\n\nhell, just this week, my mom told some random guy she drove around for uber where i work despite being hyperskeptical of strangers after multiple cases of family members being taken advantage of. she told him where i work. he showed up at my job asking for me before my shift started and my manager told him i wasnt on the schedule for the day just so he wouldnt show up again later. after i heard about it, i asked my mom why she would tell some random guy where i work and her response was \"because we were having a conversation, dont question me\".\n\ni turn 16 in less than a month and im already so fucked up in the head.\n\ni cant sleep with the door open because my parents have thrown my door open in the middle of the night multiple times and started yelling at me or raiding my room, so now im scared to leave the door open because there wouldnt be a warning if someone was coming in.\n\ni cant have my closet fully closed or open because my mom raided it in the middle of the night when it was fully closed and left it open for me to see that i have no power and she can take whatever she wants when she wants when i was 13 shortly before she kicked me out. i have to have one of the doors open and the other closed or else it stresses me out.\n\nbeing yelled at is enough to send me into a panic attack or put me on the defensive depending on the day. i'll either breakdown or i'll start picking someone apart at a fundamental level just to make them stop.\n\nif i bring up any type of traumatic event from when i was little, my parents tell me that my childhood wasnt abusive or traumatic and that i have a warped sense of reality because they dont remember any of what im talking about or they dont remember it happening that way, so now i feel like i cant trust my very limited memories of my life.\n\nim so sick of feeling like im crazy or waiting for the other shoe to drop, its insane. at this point i dont know what actually happened and what my brain made up as an excuse for any of my shitty behaviour.\n\nif any of you have similar experiences, or understand where im coming from, please let me know. im sick of feeling like im alone with this.\n\ni hate the fact that theres only one place i can sit in the car that doesnt make me anxious thanks to being yelled at for entire car rides. i hate that i still have nightmares about when my mom kicked me out when it happened almost 3 years ago. \n\ni hate that i dont like most people touching me because girls in middle school would grab and harass me at school and call me things like \"girlyboy\" and say i have \"henti thighs\". \n\ni hate that i lost most of my empathy because of being relentlessly teased and constantly being kicked out of friend groups for things i either didnt do or didnt know i did because no one would tell me in the most humiliating ways possible, typically either in school hallways or cafeterias. i hate that it always left me in tears, running off into the library barely keeping it together before i could find i secluded area to completely lose it. i hate that i never know what i did to make everyone else hate me a treat me like some sort of freak or a toy they can throw away without rhyme or reason.\n\ni hate it all, and i wish i wasnt so damn fucked up. im not even done with highschool. im almost 16 and all of this shit just keeps hitting me and the punches dont stop. im so sick of it.",

From this experience i got severe trust issues and became fearfull of any person I don't know.\n\nThings came to a breaking point during COVID since I wasn't going out wich helped me to be relaxed but worsened my social anxiety. I started therapy because I needed to go back to college (I was sa'd in campus). I was able to leave my house and go out with minor issues but my fear of people persisted. I keep't pushing on therapy but couldn't get over my fear of people to wich My therapist sugested opening a dating app profile saying I don't have to meet them in person unless I feel safe, this didn't work for me, I don't have social media and had a lot of issues to translate a conversation on app to a real life meeting.\n\nSo to help myself with my fear I try to go out alone and do whatever I feel like wich happened when my job closed for one day and I went to eat alone. Being there the a guy asked for my number, I feelt a lot of fear but tried to give this a chance since I was already meeting him offline. Went to a number of shorts dates and got to his house a couple of days ago, i feelt really comfortable and even feelt like I was going to be able to have sex sobber but got really anxious and tried to back out. To this point i don't have any real reasons to feel afraid of this guy but the moment I tried to back out he got really insistent and tried to take off my clothes by force leaving me bruised in my arms and chest, i told him to stop or i would scream which worked and got to my house. Since that day i have this awful feeling of guilt, i don't want to admit to myself that he was going to hurt me and since is the first time i go to a date in 6 year i just can't stop hearing my mind going paranoid telling me that is always going to be this way.\n\nHow do you guys cope with this? I really can't see myself dating again, the future just seems so bleak, i barely have Friends since i'm so anxious around everyone. Of course it doesn't help that i have to look at my bruised self but i just don't know where to go from here. Does anyone has any tips for meeting people safely?",

Obviously I‚Äôm a fucked up mess.\n\nEverything has been taken from me. My first kiss,my first orgasm,my first time masturbating. That all happened when I was 8 because my rapist made me. Also all of my friends throught my life have left me because I‚Äôm too mentally fucked up.

And now even my parents. They were the only ones I had left but recently they told me once I‚Äôm 18 I‚Äôm being kicked out because they can‚Äôt deal with me being like this anymore. But I‚Äôm so mentally and physically ill I can‚Äôt get a job. And because I‚Äôm 17 most places in my area either take unpaid people my age or only hire people who are 18+.

The thing is, sometimes when something triggers me, my flashbacks start as remembering what happened (which involved >!psychological harm and physical touch but not physical pain<!)but then evolve into even more traumatic stuff (from my perspective at least) which never happened. This evolvement includes >!physical harm and pain<! which is intense. Sometimes it's related to something I watch or read (especially watch), for example a scene involving someone who lives through a traumatic event related to the ones I had. My mind immediately goes forward and even if the person on the TV ends up getting saved or manages to stop the event, I see and feel flashbacks of what could have happened and I literally feel the pain and all the feelings as they were mine and the victim is me. But the false flashbacks can happen also randomly, like normal flashbacks.\n\nIs false flashbacks even a thing? What's happening?\n\nNow some possible TMI which do relate to false flashbacks but aren't necessary for the understanding of the post:  \n>!Yesterday I was doing something relating to the trauma topic with someone else but it was something good and I didn't get flashbacks or anything, it was a good event... and then the other person hurt me. 100% unintentionally. The pain was the same pain I always felt in those false flashbacks, this time it was real pain though. I ended up having an awful trauma response, first fawn (which prolonged the pain because the person didn't realize at first), then freeze then flight... It was awful and fighting very hard to not add this to my existing trauma.<!",

I think the way it happened is that i came to see my sexual trauma as a \"contamination\" that made me disgusting forever, so to avoid that ever happening again I've gotten this fear. One thing i particularly struggle with is if my partner has had other partners before me, because it feels like I'm getting contaminated by not just my partner but their previous partners as well.\n\nI know logically this doesn't make sense and i don't want to think this way. I believe in sexual freedom and that people should do what they want but I can't shake this discomfort even tho it goes against everything I believe in. I recently got a new partner (online) and they told me they'd had less than 10 partners before me (I've only had 1) and just now got tested positive for >!gonorrhea!<, this severely triggered my contamination anxiety even tho they got treated for it immediately.\n\nWe had plans about meeting irl but now the thought of intimacy with them makes me repulsed and panic. Logically I know this is just a human thing that can happen to anyone and I don't want to judge them because I still care deeply for them. But it feels like if me and them ever meet irl, especially if we were to do anything unprotected that I'd inherently be \"contaminated\" by them. \n\nIt'd basically make it feel like the trauma was happening all over again and that I would be getting \"tainted\". I've been trying to rationalize for hours and hours, telling myself about how cells regenerate, how they got the treatment for the STi and trying to reframe it as them having more experience/practice instead of it being a bad thing. It helped a bit, but I simply can't shake the idea of it inherently \"tainting me\" forever if I were to do anything with them.\n\nI can't afford therapy as it is now so I'd really like self help type of advice or if anyone else has had a fear like this and how you dealt with it\n\n",

This morning at like 10 am I went to the shop and brought a big bottle of vodka I‚Äôm 17 but I have a fake ID. And the cashier knows me by now because I regularly buy alcohol and vapes from him. And today he gave me the big bottle for the price of the small one which was kind. But I get home at like 11am and by midday I drank like a quater of the bottle. Then I had to go out somewhere with my family. I got back at like 2pm and drank more of it. \n\nThen at like 6 I found out my parents had actually brought me 2 cans of these mixed flavoured vodka things because they wanted me to not over drink I guess.

I‚Äôm surprised I haven‚Äôt vomited because like I‚Äôm still gagging even now. It wasn‚Äôt even fun I just can‚Äôt stop because I want to forget about the trauma. And I‚Äôve been watching videos of little me on Christmas and new years and it just hurts a lot. Everything was fine back then. I was so happy. And then when I watch videos from when I was 8+ you can see I‚Äôm not happy anymore. Because of the trauma. \n\nI‚Äôm so suicidal. And I‚Äôm embarrassed because I was messing everyone happy new year but I spelled it wrong. Not the most embarrassing drunk text but I‚Äôm building it up in my head that everyone hates me.

    "selftext": "I learned recently that as a young child when I was being sexually abused by my dad, my mom had walked in on it once and instead of leaving him and getting me and my siblings into a safe place she just talked to him and she said he promised he wouldn‚Äôt do it again. She said it so casually like it was no big deal. Like the thigns that happened to me that haunt my sleep and my memories and my dreams every single day could‚Äôve stopped bc she knew and she just didn‚Äôt do anything. She chose her own comfort and her own image over my safety. I‚Äôve been having a hard time having a good relationship with her for a plethora of reasons but this is the thing that‚Äôs always in the back of my mind. And the craziest thing is that when I told her what happened a year ago she acted surprised like she didn‚Äôt know anything and acted completely oblivious just for her to tell me later that she knew and just trusted that he would stop. She saw what was happening with her own eyes and continued to leave me alone with him all day long for years. What can I do? How do I just move on from something like  that? How can I forgive her? \n\nEdit: just so ppl understand my circumstances a little more, I know it‚Äôs very unpopular especially on this sub but cutting her off is just not really an option right now. Her mental health is very fragile and she is currently already suffering with suicidal ideation to the point that she is not working and doing therapy full time. I am financially independent from her but all of my younger siblings rely solely on my mom and are pretty much compeltely dependent on her to which if I cut her and she attempted to hurt herself (which I truly think she would do) it would only make things worse for my family. Also culturally, cutting people off is very frowned upon. I‚Äôve cut off my father for what he had done to me but my mom is Asian and it would be an absolutely disgrace to my family to cut her off.\n\nWith all this, I really wanna know what I can do now to cope with this as I will have to be in contact with her. I just don‚Äôt wanna feel so haunted by what she‚Äôs done everytime we speak. Is there anything I can do to help myself get a bit of a grip on it for the time being at least? And I truly do appreciate any advice or insights on the matter even if you believe i should choose to cut contact. ",

    "selftext": "Not exactly sure what to title this. It feels like it was yesterday, and it‚Äôs just been ringing through my head ever since. This Christmas Eve might have been my worst Christmas. Christmas time has never been good for me. Growing up in an old immigrant family that didn‚Äôt believe in mental health problems for women I was locked in the attic or made to walk the streets due to my inability to hear certain noises or I cry. (sensory issues. I am on the spectrum) \nLast year I thought was going to be my worst Christmas. My brother (25M) is a big guy and has a lot of problems. A lot. He attacked my veteran father in front of my grandmother at her home and then blew up screaming, running out of the house. She was sobbing frantically, in the beginning stages of dementia. She passed in October, that was her last Christmas. My mom had left to go home when I was home with a friend in the garage. She texted me to get inside immediately, afraid my brother was going to come back and try to kill us because of previous incidents he has done so. We were fearing for our lives, my dad waiting at a nearby bar to try to catch him walking by since it was a very long walk. He wasn‚Äôt wearing shoes or even a coat and since it was winter and freezing some people called the cops. That stopped him from hurting us. \n\nBack to the present\n\nThis Christmas Eve was‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt know how to even explain. My brother has been destroying our house and aggressive to all of us, shoving us, eating all of our food (holiday and not) won‚Äôt let us in the kitchen or he becomes aggressive, ect. He‚Äôs unemployed because he can‚Äôt keep a job and he‚Äôs a few months sober from substances after he had a massive overdose in September and had multiple seizures so he can‚Äôt drive either. He‚Äôs made our lives a living hell in so many ways I don‚Äôt have room to type. He can be so kind, but yet he can be so cruel. His personality flips instantly and he can become hostile. \n\nWe were driving in the car on the way to church for Christmas Eve at 11pm. I was sick and had just gotten off a long shift at work but I was bearing through it because it was the only thing my dad asked of us. Not even a few minutes in and my brother who was next to me was beginning to flick and prod me painfully, trying to provoke me. He suddenly began to spew all of this hateful stuff, cussing me out and then hitting my leg. I can‚Äôt even remember what was happening but he has these moments of delusion and violence. He was saying something about how he was the happiest person in the family (he is severely depressed and aggressive and is never happy, and makes all of us live in fear) and I finally had enough. I told him that he was not happy, because he was mean to us constantly. There was a pause, I thought he‚Äôd be quiet from there. Without warning he struck me multiple times, as hard as he possibly could. I screamed, and the car stopped immediately as both of my parents began to break down. My dad was about to cry, yelling ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do this anymore. Why (brother name), why?!‚Äù And my mom was crying and begging him to stop. Everybody jumped out of the car at once. I was frozen on the road as my dad ran to my brother making sure he wasn‚Äôt going to hurt me anymore and my brother ran up to my dad and was holding onto his arm. My mom took the car and had to coax me and nudge me in because I was frozen. I just started sobbing from there. \n\nThis is summarized as short as I possibly can with context, but I now have massive bruises all over my body. Massive. They hurt. They‚Äôre ugly. They‚Äôre still dark purple now and turning ugly yellow. He‚Äôs hurt me a lot in my life but it hasn‚Äôt been this bad in a long, long time. Customers were staring at me at my job the other day. Some of them whispering about the bruises. That was just my arm, but they didn‚Äôt even see my leg. It‚Äôs so embarrassing and I want to curl away. I‚Äôm 21F. He is 25M. He is so much bigger than me, twice my literal height and weight. I kept telling myself it wasn‚Äôt that bad until the next morning I saw how large the bruises were, and how many there were. \n\nSorry for how long this is. It‚Äôs going through my mind so much and I‚Äôve been going through so many emotions. I‚Äôve been leaving my room to work, but I‚Äôve just been sleeping so much more now. Staying in my room. My parents bought him an apartment for Christmas because of how violent he has been to everybody. Then Christmas Eve happened. He‚Äôs caused my dad‚Äôs health to deteriorate, his hair instantly greying over the course of a year. The doctor says that he is at high risk of a heart attack over everything my brother is putting my dad through. None of us can take it anymore. \n\nEver since then he‚Äôs been so mean. Shoving us, cruel, I stay away as much as I can. ",

So I usually check \"not at all\" or \"rarely\" for that one.  \n\nBut here's the thing: I often avoid sleep.  Like, I'll find literally anything to do if it means staying awake.  Like, it'll be 3am, and I'll be doing dishes by hand because while I avoided them all day, suddenly now is the best time to do it, even if I'm exhausted.  Only when I'm well and truly about to keel over do I trudge into bed.  Or if my wife drags me there by the ear (and not in the fun way).\n\nWhich has left me with a theory.  What if I *do* have nightmares about my trauma which I repress, but my subconscious remembers and wants to avoid the nightmares by not going to bed?  I've brought this up with my therapist and psychologist, and they've agreed that it's certainly a theory.

I'm tired of being hypervigilant all the time and never letting my guard down, even around people I love and trust.  To quote Henry Caville, \"I can't fucking sleep!\"",

Redoubled my already alarming drinking, blacking out every night as close to my barracks room as I could get. Raped no less than a dozen times.\n\nMany friends die.\n\nI leave the military, start trying to get my shit together. Stay with parents. Mom steals my medication.\n\nNext relationship ends with her saying I'm physically abusive and tells my family and friends I am actively homicidal so I have nowhere to go for help.\n\nTurn to an old friend.

And whenever I start to think that it can‚Äôt get worse it somehow does\n\nWhen I was a little kid I was severely abused by my father, he has never in his life touched a drop of alcohol but that does not matter, rather it makes what he did worse, I would be punched, kicked, slapped and threatened for doing anything, the worst of it was when me and my brother were caught swearing, he absolutely lost it, I was told to go to my room and I peeked out to see him grab my brother by his head and slam him as hard as he could into the doorway. Then I was told to come out, he had a knife in his hand and pointed it to my face and told me and my brothers that he wanted to kill us (I believe I can‚Äôt fully remember what he said), then what I remember next was him taking us to his room and telling us to show him the YouTube videos we heard the swearing from, he would tell me to come to him and he would kick me as hard as he could sending me flying across the room (he used to be a judo champion so his kicks hurt like hell) and he would tell me to come back for the cycle to repeat. Then he took me and my brothers to shower and watched us shower while holding his hitting stick telling us if we took to long he would beat us while we were naked. The next day we came to school and he told our teachers that we fell over. (I was like 7). I‚Äôm 16 turning 17 in a few days now, I am 6‚Äô1, built like a tank and could destroy my father if he ever laid a finger on me again, but still whenever he gets angry I freeze up and panic and my heart starts pounding uncontrollably.\n\nIn primary school I would get beaten up daily by multiple groups of kids for my race. I don‚Äôt know why they had such a problem with it. One day my only friend at the time heard something about my family‚Äôs religion and was terrified of me, he ran away from me screaming and crying and had to be consoled by a teacher. This all went on until I moved schools\n\nDuring that time when I was abused by my dad and beaten at school my mother was the only person there for me, in hindsight she was just relatively better that‚Äôs why she was on such a pedestal in my eyes, she would simply watch me get beat by my father without empathy or any attempt at stopping him. Anyways, one day we were at ikea getting food after buying stuff, and I dropped a little food on my shirt and she looks up at me with a deadpan expression and tells me ‚Äúyou‚Äôre a disgrace‚Äù. I start silently crying (tears just falling down my face) and she continues like nothing was just said and even joked around later. For years I would bring it up and she would either lie, get angry, or manipulate me. I also noticed the type of person she really was which I don‚Äôt want to get into because I have a lot more other trauma\n\nThere was an ongoing war a few years ago (proxy conflict technically) which I won‚Äôt specify which one. During that time there was a barrage of missiles every few weeks that would get shot down above our heads, one day one of them slipped through and blew up and oil refinery abt 2-3km from my house. My cousin runs into my apartment (we lived in the same complex) and incoherently says smth abt a bomb and throws open the window showing the fire as high as a sky. The fire burned for days and the smoke stayed even longer. As soon as I saw it I called my parents who were away to check on them, then I called my brother to check on him and he didnt pick up, I called him again and again and again and again but he didn‚Äôt pick up once and I thought he was dead, he ended up calling me back later, he was fine but just didn‚Äôt pick up his phone bc he just doesn‚Äôt notice it. \n\nThis is more recent happening less than a year ago, but I was scrolling on TikTok and came across a suicide note posted by someone, I immediately messaged him asking abt stuff and trying to talk him out of it. I ended up stupidly putting my phone down and saw a message from a few minutes before saying ‚Äútaking the pills now ahaha‚Äù. I spammed him and he replied hours later in the hospital. I would sometimes see how he was doing and he was just getting worse until he eventually never opened my messages again. I know when someone is in pain and when they‚Äôre fucking around because I‚Äôve been there before I get called an over trusting teenager. I still blame myself and it‚Äôs a guilt I live with now and probably will forever.\n\nI am not constantly unhappy, angry or scared, I never get a break from my brain and the only thing that brings me true comfort is drugs and alcohol. I only get worse and I think I will be like this for the rest of my life whether it ends by my own hands or not. Therapy hasn‚Äôt helped either",

We weren't big gun people, but the gun was an old Russian rifle, so he had lot of ammo because of how it came. \n\nNow I've been in a relationship for about a year and a half. I kinda knew I wasn't ready, but I really liked the guy and I thought if I waited until I was ready, I would be waiting forever. I thought I could learn as I went. I was retraumatized when I was arrested for a DUI and again when I went to jail. Now I'm on probation and two months sober. A few months ago I began to feel like I just wasn't ready. Things have gone generally well, but he's wanting to move in together. In the beginning I fantasized about living together and how nice it would be, but I think I was deluding myself. I have a bad habit of taking on the dreams of my romantic partners and convincing myself I'll be happy living the life they want. Now the idea of doing that all again is horrifying to me. I don't want to live with someone else. I need a lot of alone time and I like having my own space. I don't want to have to compromise or feel out of control. I still have a very difficult time saying no. I don't want to have joint accounts or shared bills. I don't want to rely on someone else. I don't want to feel trapped. It doesn't help that my son, who is now seven, doesn't really like my boyfriend that much. My boyfriend does great with him, but they just have clashing personalities. I'm also starting to feel like we don't want the same kind of life. I feel terrible. I know I need to end it. He has been so nice and patient and supportive. I owe him a lot of money which makes me really uncomfortable. I was trying to let him help me, because I'm not good at that, but I feel like I should have said no. Right now I feel like I just want to be alone. I don't have the energy or space to be in a relationship. I'm a shell of who I used to be. Making dinner for a man is triggering. Doing his laundry is triggering. Cleaning for him in general is triggering. Sometimes being told I'm beautiful or sexy is triggering, I went through a hoe period after my husband died and heard things like this from a lot of men, I used to enjoy the complementa but it makes me feel gross now. Like I'm an object, prize, or trophy. Something to be obtained and kept. I need to put everything I have into me and my son. I need the space and freedom to live the life I want. I've felt a little pressure from my father to be in a relationship. He thinks I need to figure out my issues with relationships and that my son needs a father. But my son doesn't have a father. He's gone. And forcing a man on him that he doesn't really like isn't better. \nLately I haven't wanted to see my boyfriend at all. I don't miss him, I dread seeing him. I feel bad that I feel this way, but I can't get around it. I try to be there and be present when we're together. And I enjoy our time while I'm there, but eventually I start getting antsy and I want to go home and when I'm home I feel how wrong it is. I think I understand now why you should wait to have sex in a relationship. It muddles things. It feels like our relationship got ahead of the conversation. I like him, I'm attracted to him, he's sweet, and supportive, and patient, but we have different lifestyles and want different things. I just feel so guilty. I don't know how I let things get so far. I feel like I woke up from a daze. Like I was just going along. I wasn't really present. \n\nThanks if you're still here. \n\nETA since I've been sober a lot of stuff has been coming back up. All the shit I pushed down for years. I miss my husband a lot. I'm grieving him in a way I hadn't before. He was mentally ill, but he was still my best friend and the father of my child. He was angry and controlling, but he got me in a lot of ways that one else ever has. I had a great love, especially in the beginning, before I got pregnant and things got bad. I don't know if I need another one. I want to be the cool aunt with the cool son. I want to put all my energy into making life the best I can for me and my son. We've had such a hard time and we both deserve that. I want to live all the dreams I shelved to be in a romantic relationship. And maybe along the way I'll meet someone who actually wants the same things. But for now, I just want to be alone. I want to feel peace and relationships just don't give me peace. Is it ok if I'm never ready?",

    "selftext": "Hey guys, first post hoping for some advice. I went through a mental breakdown early this year, Severe anxiety and panic attacks and eventually depression. When I first started getting the panic attacks I had no idea what was going on and was extremely scared that I was losing control of my mind. At first, I thought it was just anxiety and panic, so I tried to 'fight' it the only way I knew how, being ex military and kept pushing, and going into work and not letting it defeat me.\n\nI eventually got some really good therapy and did a lot of work on the causes, the deep held beliefs and stuff that happened in my childhood. I then went into a depressive period (that I had clearly been avoiding for over a decade) and again did lots of diferent types of therapy and learnt how to be comfortable with it.\n\n10 months on and after feeling generally better about life, I couldn't understand why I kept getting triggered and feeling like I was back in those panic attacks with intense fear of losing control and something bad happening, plus all the other symtpons of severe anxiety and exhastion/fatigue/tinnatus afterwards. It was really frustrating because I felt like a lot of the childhood stuff was healed and I was more comfortable anout being me.\n\nBut when I frequent the places where i had the  bad panic attacks, and the places where I just kept pushing through during the breakdown (such as my office) I get those almost emotional flashbacks. In addtion to this, in anywhere unfamiliar i am now hyper vigilent. I push through and try to be gentle with myself and be patient but it can be super exhausting and disorientating To me it feels, like the period of time during the bad breakdown and panic attacks have caused this and I've inly just realised it could be PTSD.\n\nTrying to be compassionate to myself, continue therapy and yoga/gym as well as connecting with my close humans. Any advice or reccomendations would be super useful.\n\nThanks so much  ",

The car he took away from me in an attempt to destroy my support structure and get me to come crawling back to him. Well, during his failed attempts to get me to come back, he got really drunk one day and drove the car into a wall. Nothing super crazy, he accelerated from a dead stop into a wall about 15ft away, but it still did some decent damage.\n\nToday was the first time I saw the car and the damage done to it and I froze. My stomach dropped, I immediately ran to the bathroom and had one of the worst stomach aches I've had basically since I left that toxicity a year ago.\n\nThis is the part that confuses me though. Throughout all of the negativity of blaming myself for what he did (which I know is wrong and I'm still unlearning) and how I ruined everyone's lives who were involved, I had a sense of what I can only call....... satisfaction......\n\nI feel SO incredibly guilty for feeling some sort of pride (might not be the right word?) in making my ex so upset that he went and did what he did. Granted, he has been dealing with alcoholism for about 3-4 years now but apparently, I made him relapse hard. And at the time he was telling me this (as another attempt to make me feel bad and come crawling back) I felt like a horrible person and that maybe I should've never left. But now, after seeing the car, my feelings are completely different.\n\nHas anyone else experienced anything like this? I feel bad for completely uprooting myself and in turn forcing everyone else to uproot themselves but also, I'm so glad I got out and I'd do it over again in a heartbeat. I also can't help but feel petty and childish for enjoying his pain? I don't know. I don't think that's okay or fair but I don't know how to process this.",

I feel like i'm being rejected for having complex-ptsd and i'm a sick burden on everyone related to me because of this mental illness i cant control due to trauma i didn't ask for... my ptsd assistance dog is the one thing keeping me alive in this world.. keeping me fighting these trauma demons for a better tomorrow instead of ending it all today. why do i feel like such a coward for it? is anything worth pursuing anymore knowing it's likely my family won't want anything to do with me?\n\nUpdate: my mum hates what i'm doing now too, it's like her words then meant fuck all, she only care about \"our principles\" ffs",

    "title": "I have no Memories but such strong Emotions",
    "selftext": "Hello guys, its deep in the night. I've never been here and this is a throw-away until I have an answer on what I am. I ask for your help and for your experience because i feel like i am lying to myself or finding excuses.\n\nFrom the get-go: i have a great support network and i am at a time and place in life where i am safe. I have suffered for a decade now and I think that me being safe is a reason im starting to grasp my emotions. I am in therapy and my therapist asked me to not go into the emotions too deep over christmas, as she wants me in reach when i do. She didn't elaborate further. I am there for ADHD and depression, not trauma.\n\nTRIGGER WARNING: i will explain my emotional reaction in depth and emotional abuse, aswell as talking about self harm (not about me)\n\nI have no memory of anything extremely traumatic. But i've always been depressed and i always had stretched periods of time of deep depression, mostly by trying to live my fucking life. I am trying to study, but i always crash into a wall at some point. Not because i'm studying, but because i'm *living*. My emotions just get stronger and stronger, i get more anxious the farther i go and i start spiraling if i ever set a foot forward, but just in emotions, not in memory. \n\nIt's bad at the moment. I lost a pet a few month back and i think that set me down this path. I freeze when i have to go to bed. I am terrified of closing my eyes and *feel*. Because if i do, this always nagging feeling is just right in my breast, a feeling of primal fear. It's what i grew up with and i'm basically never without. If it's bad, it'll start spreading in waves throughout my body, making me feel fight or flight - well, flight. But i don't freeze intentionally or because i think \"sleeping terrifies me\" i actually like sleeping and going to bed (normally). But my body freezes. I don't want to feel the emotions that get me just when i finally put away the phone at 3am because i CANNOT drag this out longer. I have to close my eyes. And then i will start feeling the fear, because there is nothing else i can occupy my brain with.\n\n But i don't feel them ahead of time. I repress them, i just think \"ah another chapter\" \"another post\" \"today we gonna go to bed early\" \"why would you stay awake so long\" and it's been 2 hours.\n\nI made it into bed, 3h after i wanted to. And i'll read, or watch smth. 2h longer than i want to. And as soon as i stop i feel. The recent months i have tried to loose control over my emotions, to not regulate them and let them break free. Because i've always kept them in check since i've been young, it's ingrained in me. And it's crumbling, just... without memories. I don't know what i'm terrified off, I just know that i *am* and that it's from the *past* (woohoo improvement after 10 years!). \n\nBut my brain is trying to fill the gaps and i kind of have to know if this is me having a hunch, or me desperately trying to find an explanation.\n\nTbf i don't know if i have ptsd. I have trauma, but i talked about it so much, it just confuses me. Ah im a mess im sorry im trying to stay structured.\n\nI have trauma sprinkled throughout my life: rough family life, screaming daily, throwing doors, no emotional space for child me; one of them is just child me crying. Because i wanted to be read a goodnight story. My family has worked very hard on themselves and we all survived it together, but it for sure did not give me a stable foundation to lean on.\n\nIn school.... i had undiagnosed adhd (god diagnosed last year, wow. In my early 20es.). I was traumatized, had odd behaviour, didnt fit in at all..... etc. I did get bullied (lightly) as in, always being last, not getting appreciated by anyone, people disliking me without ever talking to me, trying to disagree with everything i say and sometimes physical stuff like throwing balls at me. I had friends, it just always felt wrong. I do think my friends kinda gave it their best? But well, it wasn't great.\n\nOut of school many of my friends were online, mentally ill. Mentally ill people just find each other and it isn't healthy. My first internet best friend was my age at the time (11) and she wasn't good. Well, she gave me her attention and for once i was nbr 1, truly, but she was toxic. If i said no to something, i didn't like her. If i didn't make time, i didn't want to spend it with her. If i criticized her, i hated her.\n\nTRIGGER WARNING: description of self harm and emotional blackmail\n\nI visited her with 13. Our parents switched contacts, no shade to my mom. She made triple sure i was save and i wanted to do this. I don't fault her. I was 8h away from home. It was great, 2 weeks. Until one night.\n\nI was blocked in my fieldbed, in a corner, she infront of me. And she went on, all night, how i am a terrible person (i had told her month before i believe i had a crush on her - which i hadn't. But it was a bit back and forth. She used this as an explanation why she's behaving this way now.). That i am at fault for her depression. She proceeded to describe to me in excruciating detail how she would go down and end her life, and how she would do it. And that it was because of me. \n\nWell, thats a trauma. But it isnt something i havent talked about. In all the deatils, i went over this multiple times in my life. But i feel like i never truly. Comprehended it? I believe i. In the attempt to tell people about it, i shut off emotions so i could. And i never reached out to those emotions. And well, i mean. I was troubled prior, already.\n\nI needed a year to change. I ended contact 3 month in. After a year, i started to become deeply depressed with \"i do not want to go on\" thoughts (never any attempts or smth, just that \"no power\" feeling.). I started light self harming in a way noone could see - biting - and shortly after that i asked for therapy, as i knew these Symptoms from around me. I was emotionally distant, didn't want anyone to show affection or hug me (it just made me uncomfortable to show affection).\n\nTrauma, coupled with undiagnosed adhd, made my therapists basically completetly inable to help me. I had trouble expressing my emotions and many struggles came from my adhd and not depression. It made no sense.\n\nJust in recent years, especially as i worked through my school traumas, have i started to actually grasp who i am and how i work. But this chest feeling is still there.\n\nThank you so much if you've read so far. I need help and i just. My thoughts are a mess. Not help in a professional sense, i think i just need some impressions.\n\nWhy am i posting here. Well, i feel like this event might either have more parts to it which i repressed - as thinking about it does. Upset me. But not to the extent of panic attacks i summon by letting my emotional stone thing go from control. Those attacks dont feel like they are mine, they feel like ones from years back that just were stuck in a timefreeze. It's weird. And because my brain is kinda trying to find a reason.\n\nDid she abuse me physically in any way i forgot? Is it not this event, am i just trying to find SOMETHING? to explain my hurt? Is it my family? I am utterly terrified that i am repressing something from my family, cuz im living with them and i want to keep it as it is today. Hence why i feel like my brain is kinda panicking and just tugging at any strings it can find.\n\n(Adding: my family is completetly different compared to my childhood!! Everyone has been in therapy and *everyone* is still on close speaking terms. There is a lot of love now.)\n\nI am utterly terrified of what my emotions hold. I just stopped myself tonight, with my therapists words ringing in my head, as i was trying to loosen control over my emotions (i know she told me to not but i feel so fucking shitty atm.). My body felt aloof, i started getting dizzy, my legs and hands went cold, i just stared into the night, crying. But no Memories, just the feeling that my Brain is trying to repress SOMETHING. Luckily, i have full consciousness and could just... stop. But it made me think. \n\nIs this ptsd? \n\nI kinda. Want it. Because it. Gives me something to hold on to.\n\nI have tried it with depression for years, but no amount of therapy could lessen this panic making void i have in my chest. After having that thought i cried and just felt bitter, but a bit lighter. \"I wasnt imagining things\" \"this isnt normal to feel\". \n\nMy therapist also told me to start with anti depressiva agin just before christmas, as she was worried about my state. (I was even able to organize everything on my own and started them 2 days ago :)  ) But im kinda. Am i just trying to find an excuse? Is it something else im just tpp cowardly to stand up against? Like... i dont fuxling know, im just lazy???? \n\n\nIm so sorry this is so long but im just fucking hoping someone out there takes time to read it. I am expecting no absolution, just some... experience? Thoughts? Everything else i'll handle with professionals.\n\nThank you. To somebody out there. Hopefully. I am doing... okay.\n\n\n",

But of course I just couldn‚Äôt tell him at the time what was really going on with my mental health. \n\nIt‚Äôs honestly making me really suicidal. I just want to be done with it.

I'm just afraid that if I try something new I'll get flooded. Will push everyone away.

    "selftext": "Hello, sorry if I am doing this wrong as this is my first time posting. I (23f) have been diagnosed with PTSD ever since losing my house to a fire about 3 years ago. To accurately talk about what is goin on right now at work I have to give y'all some history. \n\nWhen my house caught fire we were all home and luckily everyone made it out, however we were displaced for about 1.5 - 2 years. The fire in my home was not the first one I had experienced in a relatively short period of time. About 3 months prior the root seller underneath my porch caught fire. After that and about three weeks before the house fire the two sheds on my property burned completely to the ground. After my house fire we moved into hotel room and we were there for a few months. There we had another fire in the hotel room we were staying in. From there we moved into a rental house that was in the woods. There was a storm and the woods around the house caught fire. \n\nAll this to say shortly after the house was lost I was diagnosed with PTSD. I am really triggered by loud sounds, fire alarms, the smell of smoke and for the longest time I could not even take a shower by myself - I had to have someone sit in the room with me. A few months passed and I got a SD named Calliope (Callie for short) she is a Standard Poodle and she has saved my life more times than I honestly care to admit. She helps me everyday to have the strength to get out of bed and is there to hold me during my panic attacks. \n\nI recently started working in my dream role in a major hospital in the states. I am working as a medical assistant and from there hopefully going on to become an RN. At this job I am rooming patients to be seen, getting a medical history, drawing blood, removing casts, etc. I have had no problems in this job and find myself feeling quite proud about how far I have come from not even being able to leave my room. I did not even request to being my SD to work. My only accommodation request was if there is a scheduled fire alarm going off to let me know in advance. This is where my problems started. \n\nI am in an ambulatory role meaning I am not technically hired in this department. I, as well as other members of this program are trained in a clinic and then told to apply, with the expectation to most likely get into that clinic. Well, the manager in the clinic I applied to, we will call her \"Amy\" had been checking in on our progress. I decided to be open about my diagnosis to the people in my clinic so that they are aware  if something happens to me - especially since I do not have my SD with me during the day. Two days ago I was pulled into a meeting with Amy who wanted to check in and see if I was planning on applying. I let her know that I was. She then asked me about how I was doing and about accommodations. I let her know that I am doing well and re stated that I only wanted to be informed about scheduled fire drills and casually mentioned and issue about where I needed to sit (we don't have set spots in the clinic and one of the rows of seating has its back to the rest of the clinic which is triggering to me). Amy then proceeded to ask if I was planning to apply to other clinics. I let her know that no I did not want to work in another specialty. Amy told me that while she knows I am meeting expectations with my skills, she thinks I would be better suited for working in a smaller clinic due to my PTSD. I let her know that this is where I wanted to work and I know it will be hard but I believe that I can do it. She told me that she is still going to interview me but agreed that it was just checking a box and she already knows what she's going to do. \n\nLater that day I asked Amy to send me an email recapping what we had discussed and the said this \"Summary of conversation from 12/26:\n\nWhen rounding in the morning you asked if we could touch base and I actually wanted to chat also to schedule our interview at that time we agreed to meet after I rounded on all the clinics. You started by explaining to me about your appointments and living with PTSD and how you have to advocate for yourself. You also took this time to explain that you feel people have looked at you different when you tell them about your PTSD. You explained that you have chosen to tell everyone about that so people can understand why you may have challenges with certain tasks or environments. I am not sure why you wanted to talk to me about these concerns as I think this more appropriate to bring to your current manager. I am glad you have a meeting set with her next week to talk through everything.\n\nThen we shifted the conversation to talk more about how we have multiple candidates interested so we have to conduct formal interview and make sure it‚Äôs a good fit for both the candidate and our team. I then asked you if you were exploring other options, to which you said no because you only wanted to work here. At that time I suggested you look into other places to continue to keep your options open and in my opinion you may thrive in a calmer, more routine environment. We talked through how we have a extremely busy clinic, multiple providers in one POD, variety of specialties, ages and tasks needed to work here. We are unpredictable and our CMAs are asked to function at a high level. You need to sit in certain seats in the clinic to feel comfortable and like warnings on change of plan for day. You have asked me to tell you when we are having fire drills and other events in the building. I wanted to be honest on how this clinic works as I would with any other person interested in working here. I want to be honest in challenges we face and expectations we have of our team.\n\nMoving forward I would ask that you address your concerns with (Current Manager) as she is your current Manager. I also ask that you limit your personal conversations with our team members and focus on learning about Orthopedics and getting signed off on the MA competencies.\"\n\nMy biggest issue with all of this is that she told me she did not believe she can accommodate me and that  despite having all the skills I need she does not want me to work there  due to my PTSD. I understand that she is not my current manager however she is the manager in the building and how the program works is that we don't go through out \"current manager\" we are supposed to be working under the clinics manager i.e Amy.  I would understand if I am not the best candite skills wile but she said that is not the issue. She has already hired all of the other people in my program that trained in her clinic. I just do not know what to do. \n\nSorry for the long post I just really needed to vent and hopefully get some advice. Thank you all for taking the time to read this. ",

He is just starting therapy, a few sessions in. \n\nIn short, at times he has been very verbally abusive, mean, nasty, throwing things, terrifying over the last 2 years of our marriage. Eggshells doesn't quite describe it. It's more like don't be around me at all. (And then I get blamed for abandoning him). The first year he worked so much I barely saw him and I was taking care of our newborn. I believe he is finally turning a good corner, but progress is so slow and uncertain. He has been like this almost all of his life. \n\nI love who he is as a person, but I also am a realist when it comes to this problem. We have only been married 2.5 years and we have one child. I just don't know that it is \"worth it\" to stick around. I hate saying that like that but he seems so far gone sometimes. Like it would take 5-10 years of therapy to get him to be the husband I would want to be married to. I want more kids and a stable harmonious family. That's one of my dreams in life. I was codependent when we met and we got pregnant accidentally extremely fast and I've been in therapy for codependency. \n\nI don't not want him in my daughters life but it truly feels like the pressure and needs of a family are too hard for him. So it all falls onto me. I get resentful and angry. Plus I'm trying to recover from toxic caregiving and this really doesn't help that.\n\nI hate ditching him when he needs his wife most. But I also don't feel like it's right to just take the abuse while he takes his time working out issues. We live separately right now but he really wants to move back in together and it's like why? So you can just blame me and take out your fear on me all the time and make me carry all the responsibilities for you? No thanks, I don't want a husband who is basically showing up as a child. I don't say that meanly, it's just that is truly where he is. A terrified 10 year old boy who just wants his mother to function. I don't want my sympathy for him to fuel my codependency. I can't do therapy for him. Only he can get better himself *with professional help* and taking it out on me just makes me hate him tbh. ",

    "title": "My stepbrother sexually abused me and said he doesn‚Äôt remember ",
    "selftext": "I‚Äôm in the process of coming out to my family/parents that my stepbrother sexually abused me when we were kids. I‚Äôm looking for support, and possibly advice, as I share my story/journey during this. This is a long one, so, if you‚Äôre willing, find a comfy spot to sit and read while I bare a small piece of my soul.\n\nI‚Äôm currently 29 and struggling with a situation around my csa. When I was around 11-12, and my stepbrother was around 15-16 (4 yrs age gap), he sexually abused me for a brief period of time.\n\nBackstory:\nMy parents (dad and stepmom) have been together for around 27 years, so my stepbrother has been part of my family since I was 2yrs old. When I was little, I think around 3-4, my babysitter‚Äôs husband sexually abused me. I can recall some of the details of the abuse; how he looked and smelled (the smell was nasty, I think he was a mechanic or something, he was dirty and smelled like grease), that we would sit on the step of the living room when it happened, and that he would give me all of the dirty coins in his pocket as a gift for our little secret of him sticking his hands in my pants to touch me. I can sparsely remember my childhood, I‚Äôd say about 90% of what I do remember before my teenage years was the sexual abuse, most everything else is either fuzzy or nonexistent in my memory. I know this is a result of trauma.\n\nWith being exposed to sexual abuse when I was little, I‚Äôm sure my brain initially reacted much different to the situation with my brother than the average brain would. I cannot recall the first time/how it happened, the exact length of time it continued happening, or the time of year it happened in, but I do know it was around the age of 11-12 for a brief period of time. I have very specific and detailed memories of what he did to me in that period of time. For example, I can remember the bottle of lotion he made me use when he wanted me to touch him; I remember the scent, the color of the lotion, the shape/size of the bottle, and the lid/opening the lotion came out of. There are numerous other things I remember; things he said and made me do, things I said to try to get out of the times he came to my room, etc.. \n\nFast forward a few years and I‚Äôm in high school around freshman year; I miss my period and it‚Äôs like everything hits me suddenly and I get this intense panic of ‚Äòwhat if I‚Äôm pregnant‚Äô despite me literally knowing at the same time that it‚Äôs not physically possible because it had been years since anything happened. Despite knowing that, my brain catastrophized and said what if it was while I was sleeping, and that intense anxiety continued until my period happened a couple days later. I had that fear because, if I was pregnant, people (specifically my family) would find out what happened. Totally illogical. The only person who knew in high school was my best friend. \n\nDue to my genetics and trauma as a child (emotionally abused by my stepmom at the time as a cherry on top) my BPD developed through high school. I ended up self harming quite a bit my senior year, had some suicidal ideation with a test to see about it here and there, and went from an honor student to barely passing my classes. I finally came out to my parents about the self harming one day when my stepmom wouldn‚Äôt stop verbally beating me down. They put me in therapy, but that didn‚Äôt do jack squat. A month after I graduated, I moved out of my parent‚Äôs house without a word while they were at work. \n\nFast forward another ~2 years and add on two sexual assaults and a school mass shooting. I‚Äôve been seeing this therapist for a few months, he‚Äôs now the second person who knows about my childhood. I get my parents to come to a test therapy session and disclose my adhd, they‚Äôre accepting and my stepmom was like ‚Äòmakes total sense.‚Äô Cool, now here‚Äôs the real test I tell myself, I have them join another and I tell them about the childhood sex abuse and two sexual assaults in college, while also stating I don‚Äôt want to share the names of anyone (outside of babysitter). My dad shuts down, my stepmom bawls her eyes out, and I end up comforting them while hugging her and telling her it‚Äôs okay. \n\nFast forward another ~8 years to current time. Since that therapy session 8 years prior, my stepmom is a different person, I can‚Äôt remember the last time she said something mean to me, and I‚Äôm pretty close to her relative to how close I am to my family in general. My relationship with my family is much better, but there‚Äôs this invisible wall - the abuse from my stepbrother I have kept secret for almost two decades. Through ~10 years of my journey with personal research/internal work during my bachelor in psychology to figure myself out (yay logic and treating myself like a subject to study), lots of self harming behaviors, hospital stays, drug abuse, close calls with death, unhealthy relationships, individual therapy, learning to advocate for myself and others, EMDR, neurofeedback, group therapy, etc., and what feels like a 100 different medication attempts with my psychiatrist, I have finally hit a stable spot in my life. I have a career, I‚Äôm applying for my masters degree, I‚Äôm newly married to my partner of almost 5 years, I‚Äôve been on a medication that‚Äôs held my BPD symptoms in check enough to be managed for almost 5 years (whole other journey on that one with my relationship) and I have a great family of friends I‚Äôve built for myself. \n\nYet. Yet I still can‚Äôt pin point where all of this self hate is stemming from. Then, in therapy (yay), I realize it‚Äôs that secret, the secret that makes me feel like a liar and a fake to my family, the secret that I have taken and built into being my responsibility to keep so it doesn‚Äôt negatively impact anyone else - my responsibility because he obviously would never tell. I have lots of fun control/ocd struggles as a result of my life experiences, so that adds to that weight a good amount. That experience heavily impacted every part of my life, and still does, yet it is the one thing I push down because of my intense feelings of responsibility for my impact on others. In the last month, I realized I cannot move on with my life and let go of this (what felt like permanently) coiled ball of anger, hate, fear, and sadness until I tell my parents the truth. Two weeks ago I decided I need to talk to him first. Through EMDR I realized I don‚Äôt want our family to change, I am fine keeping my distance from him at family gatherings like I already do, I forgive him with the understanding that it doesn‚Äôt make it okay, and I want to move on with my life having minimal impact from this truth. They are my family, I love them, their feelings and choices are not my responsibility, and I deserve to be heard. \n\nStep 1: talk to him on Christmas Day about the fact that I remember, and that I plan to talk to our parents about it. We live 2 hours away and only gather a handful of times a year, so it was my best opportunity. \nStep 2: meet with my parents the following weekend to tell them. That goes back to how often we meet, doing it now gives a large gap of time between now and the next gathering.\n\nI swallowed my nerves, nausea and shaking hands included, and went up to him when there was a moment of privacy when he went to the bathroom to wash his hands. I bring it up gently in a vague sense without directly saying it, wanting to avoid being accusatory or threatening in my delivery, and am waiting for the backlash of angry denial. It doesn‚Äôt come. Instead, he acts genuinely concerned and confused with a somewhat gentle tone. He says he doesn‚Äôt know if he blocked it out or what, as he has no idea what I‚Äôm talking about, but that he wants us to talk about it more, maybe in a phone call, before I talk to anyone else about it. I say okay, and he holds out his arms to me and asks for a hug. I‚Äôm in so much shock from his response that I just freeze for a moment, then reluctantly hug him. \n\nExcuse my language, but what the actual fuck. My head is gaslighting me so intensely saying that maybe all of my memories are somehow fake and he is genuinely innocent, which makes me a horrible person who could ruin his life if I did say something, but I know it happened. With how he reacted, I can‚Äôt tell if he genuinely can‚Äôt remember, or if he‚Äôs trying to manipulate me into not talking, and maybe even gaslighting me into changing my truth. I spent the last few hours researching if it‚Äôs even possible for him to forget/block it out. I have this fear that, after I left, he told our parents I accused him of something absolutely crazy, so don‚Äôt believe anything I say if I come to them. I‚Äôm meeting with my therapist, we preset a meeting to go over how the talk might go. I was prepared for anger, outright denial, essentially anything but how he responded to me. I don‚Äôt know what to think, do, or feel right now. \n\nIf you‚Äôre still with me, thanks for reading something less than a handful of people in my life know about.",

I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs behind me animal or a person but my instinct is to run into the field of grass next to the tree line. i‚Äôm frantically explaining to my mom something or somebody‚Äôs behind me. I can barely understand what my mom is saying as I‚Äôm running i can hear footsteps behind me coming closer. I turn around well i run and it‚Äôs a black figure. I frantically tell my mom ‚Äúmom there‚Äôs a guy following me, mom he‚Äôs chasing me.‚Äù and as i turn my head toward trying to run to the cars in the street. suddenly i get tunnel vision and realize how far the run is. but before i can even think i get tackled to the ground. i feel his arm wrap around my neck as my head is face down in the dirt I am still trying to let my mom know im in danger. and the worst thing to hear as a mother is ‚Äúmommy help.‚Äù I feel his arm pull backwards around my neck. I manage to roll over but that was my mistake. I squirm and he takes his thumbs and digs it into my windpipe. I can feel the air leaving my throat. and my lungs. my vision slowly turning into patches and it slowly begins to fade black. he‚Äôs silent. as i‚Äôm begging for help trying to scream but it‚Äôs as if i have no voice. i can only hear my faint helps. and the sound of his jacket moving around. everything is dark. my last thoughts are ‚Äúi‚Äôm never gonna see my mom again.‚Äù ‚Äúi‚Äôm never gonna see my sister again‚Äù i say a prayer to god and give into the darkness. \nI remember, this feelings. a feeling of warmth. I‚Äôm warm, really warm. i feel safe here. in this darkness i know something happened but i‚Äôm not sure exactly what\nslowly that warm and safe feeling fades. I feel my stomach drop. ‚Äúam i dead?‚Äù i slowly hear my thoughts in my head. I feel as if I‚Äôm spinning I think to myself ‚Äúam i in a car, please god don‚Äôt let me be in a car.‚Äù I smell dirt. I realize I can‚Äôt see. I lift my head up and I was face down into the dirt. I see a rock next to me\nI‚Äôm scared thinking he‚Äôs sitting right next to me. I lift my head up and stand up. my pants and underwear are pulled down to my ankles. Without a thought i pull them up well i run and i manage to run out of the trees. my fight or flight wears off and im dizzy. i fall straight to the ground. I‚Äôm crawling now, I keep repeating to myself ‚Äúmommy‚Äù because it‚Äôs all i remeber saying. i‚Äôm crawling gripping the dirt in my hands digging my nails into the soil. I manage to stand up, not for long tho. I manage to run but all my weight moves forward with my body i fall face first into the ground. This repeats until I fall into the lake and feel as if i should give up here. I remeber my mother and my sister and look around. Houses, i run to the houses. I‚Äôm scratching at the windows. I bang on the windows i‚Äôm banging on the door. nobody answers. I manage to run to the second house i‚Äôm banging on the door screaming for help. a boy on a bike, bikes past me. I can‚Äôt see well \ni‚Äôm thinking rational and i think he‚Äôs the guy who just ditched me in the woods. I start cursing at him telling him to ‚Äúget the fuck away from me‚Äù at this point i fall on there front door crying banging and screaming for help. unfortunately i realize he doesn‚Äôt speak english that well when he spoke he said in a Spanish accent ‚Äúur mom sent me to come find you‚Äù I rush over to him and hug him. Im crying I keep repeating ‚Äúhe raped me, he raped me.‚Äù he rubs his hands on my back. I feel safe. \nthe peoples house i was just banging on come outside and ask me what‚Äôs happening. I‚Äôm dizzy and i walk up to them crying and all i keep repeating was ‚Äúi was raped. he raped me he raped me.‚Äù they ask me who i try to explain a guy chased me and choked me. as im stumbling they tell me to sit down. the kid on the bike runs off to go find my mom. I‚Äôm crying, they call the cops and they ask me some questions on the phone. as my mom drives up into her car she runs up to me and hugs me. i‚Äôm trying to explain but all i say is ‚Äúhe raped me.‚Äù i apologize to my mom for lying about having a ride. she understands. the cops arrive, i‚Äôm going in and out of concussions I get put into a ambulance and i‚Äôm taken to musc, a hospital in north charleston sc.\nas I sit in my wet clothes i feel disgusting. i‚Äôm covered in dirt. i‚Äôm soaking wet. i feel weird. \nI get changed into a gown and go use to restroom. blood, lots of blood.

His housemates were there and I'd met him in a public place, which made me feel slightly more safe. But after we had dinner and started watching a movie, he started to kiss me. Immediately, he put his hands around my neck and strangled me...hard. I had never been strangled before, and it shocked me. It lasted a few seconds and I couldn't breath and was on the verge of passing out. While it was happening, I genuinely thought I was going to die.\n\nAfter he stopped, he smiled at me and asked if I liked it. I told him no and that I had not expected him to do that. Then he told me how stupid I was to agree to go on a date with him, smiling with this really creepy look while saying that I didn't know who he was and he could have killed me. If it was a joke, it sounded more creepy than funny. I felt the hairs rise on my body, but I continued to \"play it cool\" out of fear of triggering him to do it again or get rejected and act crazy. I spent the rest of the evening with him, pretending to be enjoying myself, not wanting to do anything to upset or reject him. When I left, I told him that what he did disturbed me and was not okay since he had not asked for my permission and it frightened me, then blocked his number, and tried to forget about the whole thing.\n\nAt the time, I had no idea how dangerous strangulation can be. I'm learning now that even a few seconds can cause serious brain injury, unconsciousness, and serious health problems. My current partner occasionally puts his hands around my neck to jokingly \"pretend\" to strangle me (without any force or pressure), and even that action without pressure makes me feel a sense of panic. He knows about my past being strangled, but still thinks it's a funny joke.",

I had to be out by that sunday so none of them would get in trouble. Of course during all of this going on kei is still callin and calling and callin along with the group. They add me to group chat to group chat trying to get me to talk. I tell them ‚Äústop adding me to these group chats i need time, i do not wanna talk to anyone right now‚Äù. I leave the group chats of course. I get private messages from friends of mine from school because kei reached out to them to get me to talk to him. I tell them ‚Äúno i dont want to talk to him, please block him he wont stop at this point harassing me. We are no longer together, idk what hes saying to you but we are done‚Äù.

No mother fucker im not ready in 5 fucking minutes. My grandmother is keeping up with whats going on the whole time. I tell her everything that i knew about from my end. I told her about the group chats, the private messages, the nonstop phone calls, and everything. Fast forward 2 days later my parents beg to have a conversation so b and i go to the local McDonalds and meet up with them. Moms in the car crying while dad b and i are inside. I cant remember much about it but i do remember leaving on not so good terms. By that point i had been living in b‚Äôs truck with him. My grandmother finds out about that and offers for me to stay with her. B helps me move my stuff in there. During all of this b and i are getting closer and closer. Lsl catches wind of everything going on and she shows up to my grandmas house. She lectures me about everything and how its irresponsible and this and that like i cared about any of that at the time. A few weeks go by and i finally talk to kei and the group. Overall they badgered me again and i ask ‚Äúwhere are you getting this information that im cheating on you from‚Äù he doesn‚Äôt wanna tell me. He will show screenshots but he has phone numbers and usernames crossed out. Well one of the pictures he sent me was a picture of me and b in round one. Who were we with at round one? Lsl. What was the picture of? My leg lifted and b checking out my bloody foot. She said i was signaling for sex. I in fact was not. I was injured and she knew that. I told him ‚Äúand you still badger me over something i had already proven to you that that was not the context of the picture. Why do you still believe that after i proved it wrong without even knowing if the picture.‚Äù Of course we fill my grandmother in and everything. Well turns out lsl was doing more and more than just that. Shes the one who called the housing company, caused the drama between me and the group, and between my family. The very last time she came over i told our family friend who lived with my grandmother that i was done with the bull shit and her overall. She took care of her for me. When i tell you she screamed and screamed at lsl i mean it. I actually have a recording of it. I would share it if i could share videos. Overall she asked why lsl was interfering and she said ‚Äúcuz kei called me saying he wants to kill himself‚Äù. Bitch you were the one who caused all this mess dont just say ‚Äúhe called me wanting to die‚Äù. Thats not the full story hoe now is it.

That happened 16 years ago.\n\nI pretty much can't function. \n\nHow am I supposed to get therapy for this when the therapist is the thing I'm terrified of\n\nI was finally able to make a therapy appointment. A lot of it was eaten up by the therapist realizing I lied about my exact address and lecturing me. I lied so they wouldn't be able to send cops after me and forcibly institutionalize me if something went south. Now they could.\n\nI can't tell the therapist my PTSD is from violent coerced forced institutionalization, because the therapist IS the person who puts you in violent coerced forced institutionalization. They will never understand or be on my side because they are a tool of the same system that traumatized me. Their response to my extreme emotion about this would just be to violently coercively force institutionalize me.\n\nI've thought about twisting the truth and saying I was kidnapped and held against my will as a child, or my parents placed me in a cult, because I do believe those both accurately describe my experience. But it leaves out a lot of vital information, like the medicalized aspect, the fact that it's condoned by society and seen as good and a deserved punishment for being mentally ill... the fact that it could happen again.\n",

    "title": "Can greening out cause PTSD?",
    "selftext": "I want to start this off by saying that this is my first ever post and I‚Äôm sorry if this comes across as insensitive to others in this subreddit, as it normally houses much heavier topics than what I feel I am about to get into (that could just be me invalidating my own feelings, idk). I am not looking for a diagnosis, in fact I would appreciate it if responses strayed heavily from that, as I am kinda a hypochondriac, but this situation has really altered my life and I was wondering if anyone had advice in next steps for me. \n\nI am a 19yo girl who has smoked every night for the past year now in order to sleep (insomnia). Even with smoking every night, I don‚Äôt have much of a tolerance and I absolutely know my limits. I have greened out once before (when i first started smoking) and that consisted of the well known side effects such as vomiting and heavy confusion. However about a week ago I had an absolutely horrible experience. \n\nLet me set the scene: I am playing stardew valley in bed when i look at the time and what do you know? It‚Äôs 4am. I‚Äôm not super tired but I figured i should get to bed so I pack a bowl by my window. I smoke a bowl and a half (my usual limit) and go lay down to sleep. I am petting my cat and telling her how cute she is, I am high but chilling. At 5am, while I‚Äôm drifting off, my train of thought immediately warps into one of deja vu and dread. I startle and my body tenses up and shakes. My eyes are open and crying and my neck is locked in an upwards position while pain shoots down the right side of my body. I can‚Äôt move for about 15 seconds (felt like forever in my head), and after i could, I immediately jump up and out of bed, seeing weird patterns on the wall. My body feels weak and I‚Äôm shaking as I move. I leave my room and look in the mirror in the bathroom, calming myself down and breathing. I fully believe I just had a seizure. Even after looking up the symptoms of a seizure, I think I had one. \n\nI am still so incredibly out of it as I‚Äôm pacing back in forth in the hallway in front of my mom‚Äôs room debating on waking her up. When it comes to mental health, I always assume the worst, however I also have a really bad habit of invalidating myself. For example I tore my ACL and my Meniscus in my senior year of high school while playing soccer, and I thought I was just being a wimp about the pain and that it was just a sprain. Eventually, I worked up the courage to wake her up and told her I thought I had a seizure. She asked me if I had smoked, I confirmed I did, but nothing had ever occurred like this before, and she took me seriously for the most part. As I talked to her about it more, I started feeling like an idiot, but I was also so incredibly out of it because of what had just occurred. I ended up saying I was comfortable with sleeping in my bed about 10 minutes later, and I‚Äôm still shaking a little bit. \n\nAs I am laying in bed again, it feels like the same thing is about to happen, and i immediately jump up and run back into her room saying I think i‚Äôm about to have another one. She gets me to lay down and I start heavily shaking, all the while fully conscious (no pain this time and I can still respond to what my mom is saying). Her boyfriend is checking my pulse and I tell them I‚Äôm terrified and think I need to go to the ER. We get in his car and go, I barely remember to commute except being terrified and thinking that the seizures are ongoing, or that I was laced. \n\nWhen we get there, I have to be in a wheelchair to move around and my face and body feel numb, but i can still move them. At the ER, the doctors tell me that they think I‚Äôm just really high, while i‚Äôm still basically tweaking and in an absolutely awful mindset. I tell them that I‚Äôve smoked everyday for almost two years now, and I‚Äôve never felt like this. They say that they hear that all the time. They said if I was laced, that I could basically go home and sleep it off. I peed in a cup and all that came back was THC (out of what they tested for, drug testing for what I could have been laced with would take a lot longer, and i already felt terrible that I had dragged my mom and her boyfriend out of bed at 5am to take me to the ER just for them to tell me that I was high). \n\nI was back in my bed by 9am and slept until 4pm. This was about 2 weeks ago now and ever since then I have only smoked about 4 times (twice if getting smoke blown into my mouth doesn‚Äôt count) and every time I smoke I am in a very different mindset than what it used to be. It always feels very fragile and like i‚Äôm waiting for the other shoe to drop. Even sober, when I‚Äôm trying to sleep my mindset will suddenly warp to what I was feeling that night and it will terrify me enough to where i have to jolt up and breathe and make sure I can still move. \n\nI am posting this now because It‚Äôs currently 3:30am and i just had another one of those episodes. I am spending the night at my best friends and she is well aware with what‚Äôs been going on, but I took one small hit of the bong with her around 1am and we continued to watch Rick and Morty and drink tea. That was honestly the best i‚Äôve felt while high in a long time, however around 30 minutes ago (pretty much sober and trying to sleep) my train of thought again completely changes and my body is tingling, just like it was that night. \n\nIt‚Äôs hard to explain what occurs, But imagine getting the gut-wrenching feeling that your current reality is one that your mind has concocted for itself, when you are actually in a completely other place/situation and having an overdose. I immediately sat up and said ‚Äúoh no‚Äù, trying to grasp onto reality, causing my friend to awaken kinda and after getting my bearings I told her I was tweaking and to go back to sleep. I am shaking a little bit but nothing like what was happening that night. \n\nI‚Äôm not sure what happened to me two weeks ago, and at this point I don‚Äôt think it was anything in the weed that did it to me (as this has now happened on different kinds), but It has honestly completely changed my mindset and I am having an even harder time sleeping because of it. If something strange happens through my day, like the TV glitches or I get deja vu, my mind immediately thinks that my reality is not reality, and that i‚Äôm back in that same state. I need to take a couple deep breaths to calm myself down, and the feeling usually takes a while to fade. \n\nIn order help people relate to experience or identify the problem I‚Äôll say that I‚Äôve also been vaping for almost 4 years now (obviously not a big deal but I know it contributes to anxiety), and I also recently started taking prozac about a month ago. I have probably only taken it about 4 times since that night because I was scared that what happened to me was because of serotonin syndrome (yes i know i‚Äôm a hypochondriac). I am also in therapy and talked briefly about this with my therapist, but i downplayed it a lot because our last session was the day after it happened and I was still feeling so incredibly embarrassed that I had made my mom take me to the ER for being too high. \n\nMy next session is monday and I wanted to talk to her about the possibility of PTSD, because this experience has completely altered my mindset. \n\nLast thing I want to throw in, Schizophrenia (not diagnosed but I can go into further detail about why I am sure my mom has it) has also been on my mind lately, as during one of the worst periods of my life last year I was smoking heavily and seeing stuff out of the corner of my eye and even being paralyzed with fear over something that was not actually there, like seeing a man staring at me even thought it was a pile of laundry. I have always struggled with paranoia, especially when I‚Äôm high. \n\nObviously, I know the right answer here would be to stop smoking, and probably not try shrooms like I had planned to/bought before this happened, but I wanted others opinions on what they think my best course of action is going forward. \n\nEdit: I would like to clarify that Even after being completely sober for >72 hours, my mind still warps like this as i‚Äôm trying to sleep or go about my day, which causes me severe mental distress. This is why i don‚Äôt believe that I just got ‚Äúsuper high‚Äù that one night \n\nUPDATE: my therapist said it is very likely that I have drug-induced psychosis. I haven‚Äôt smoked since I uploaded this post which has definitely helped with the side effects, however it will probably be another few months until they go away completely. ",

    "selftext": "Hi guys,\n\nI just need to share in an understanding space about some triggers and hurtful behaviours received ... and how I handled it (or didn't). It's a lot and a bit rambly... but even being able to share helps things calm a bit... so, however much you show up to this, thank you. The wound is around not being heard/seen (despite my best efforts)>\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nI was successfully hibernating over the Solstice period (approx 21-25) but on Xmas eve chose to join my neighbours in a wee hallway party. It's the first one here. It's meant to celebrate having our space again as we were , in different ways, dealing with a psychotic, unwell neighbour who was diabolically disruptive and even destructive while unmonitored and skipping his meds. (I'm not exagerrating in my language... and I won't say more in case, randomly, he figures out its me posting here)\n\nPolice were involved again and again.\n\nI lived right below him and became a target for abusive even sexually harassing content. He was tall, strong, and when unwell, quite scary.\n\nThere's a housing shortage here and after moving in, I was sick and offwork (partially due to an allergy to my then-partner's weed) and scammed by someone else out of my remaining savings in a scheme that left me in debt, of all things, to the government for money I never received.\n\nSix months after that scam, this unwell neighbour escalated worse than ever... neighbours had let him misbehave for years. People had dismissed and minimised my concerns and fears... or would sympathise to a point and cut me off.\n\nI'm still dealing with the fallout from everything. Dealing with this neighbour had me running (and he stalked me) trying to find safe places to stay (let alone sleep). Nearly a year was taken up navigating this and then, when he was evicted and legally forced to stay away, it took months to sleep and eat properly again. (btw, restraining orders are not an easy thing to get.... proof of criminal harassment is a pre-req and charges for that... and *that* is extra hard to get)\n\nSo I go to this party and people start sharing different things... but when this happens, I find it hard to not say what others would feel is \"too\" much... so I shared how I am still dealing with the effects of what happened... how what hurt as much or more was how some dismissed and undermined me, even though some came around later... and how if I could have sued I would have... but had no resources and didn't want bad relations with my neighoubrs (I own that this was not the best to say)... I was longwindedly trying to make the point that I'm still paying the cost.\n\nThis longwinded share was triggered by hearing how some people wanted to save money on a cheaper lawyer (rather than keep the one who helped end nearly a decade of this guy's terrorism).\n\nHearing this reminded me of all the times I felt unsafe and unworthy of care or protection. Which was so hard and painful.\n\nA neighbour who also experienced harassment and his noise (but didn't leave right next to him or under him as I did... thus not always subject to all his noise and scary rantings), cut me off.\n\nShe cut me off to be all positive and \"celebrate\" reclaiming the space.\n\nI get people are supposed to be all positive... but I feel so much shame... I try to so hard to not overshare and notice neighbours will open up with me about how things harmed them here... until they need to stop talking. But there's little space for me to share how extra-scary this was as a single woman who was already vulnerable due to poor health and brutalised finances. (I haven't been explicit that there's also previous trauma)\n\nThen, today, on a walk to clear my head and heart of this, I go on a trail and a woman is puffing up a storm on weed. There's a no smoking policy in the park. Metres and metres of the trail wreaked of it. I'd had a nice interaction when the couple's dog ran up to me (by then she wasn't smoking)... but as I kept walking and the air was thick with it, I was triggered by that - the break up and poor health from months of reacting to my partner's smoking (leaving me with permanent dry-eye at 34 as a gardener who usually works outside). \n\nSure, I should've just kept going... but I was so rattled I called out that it wreaked of weed. She owned up to it. But I said I was allergic and she turned and just kept walking... and, again, being unheard and unacknowledged *in a situation that can cause or trigger harm.*\n\n  \n\\* \\* \\*\n\nI'm doing everything I can to heal, even keeping away from people, places and things that will trigger me ... I try hard to not overshare but realise that, the only protection, is to simply stay away from certain people - even neighbours - no matter how kind/lovely they can otherwise be.\n\nNot being heard is a wound as painful and old as I am. Same with not being acknowledged. More and more I try to not seek that outside of therapy and safe people ... but it leaks out... especially during a trigger.\n\nWhile I am grateful for this awareness, I feel so much shame and powerlessness because I cannot protect myself from all triggers all the time ... and I am barely able to control the confronting part of me that needs to compulsively speak my truth once triggered.\n\n  \n\\* \\* \\* \n\nI just needed to share in case anyone has any comforting words. I'm a proactive person. I take healing and responsibility seriously. It hurts so bad to feel this way at these times... and not be able to be regulated and un-triggerable enough to fully keep myself safe ... \n\nThank you so much for reading... I usually offer comfort out to others, but tonight, really need it from anyone able to offer it. <3 Thank you again\n\n",

And eat whatever I want. I‚Äôve had an eating disorder for years but fuck that. Who cares if I gain weight? I‚Äôm gonna die anyway. Would be good to actually eat nice food for the last few weeks of my life.",

    "selftext": "Hey gang. I am asking this to see if anybody has experience with the drug Temazepam. I get terrible nightmares. I'm back in Iraq. I see the bodies. That's all. \n\n\nThe darkness has eaten me for years. I was on 6mg of Clonazepam for 7 years. Then they switched me to Diazepam 40mg. The equivalency charts seem not to make sense in my case, as Diazepam helps more with general PTSD symptoms. \n\n\nI also was prescribed Temazepam for insomnia. It was odd. Honestly it wasn't good for me because I'd not take it - have tons saved - and binge. I had 30mg which didn't help much but in the end would be taking 90mg+ every few nights. I passed out on the couch but it was similar to abusing Alpazolam back in the day. \n\n\nI saw Diazepam and Temazepam quite literally metabolize into many of the same metabolites, so opted out. My nightmares have become a daily occurrence. They are intensifying and getting more real. \n\n\nSo I spoke with my doctor. He said that he wants to put me on something called \"prazosin\" which I've never even heard of. He told me that it is much more effective for veterans than Temazepam. The addict brain basically told me \"accept this 1mg script, take it, next month tell him you want back on Temazepam\"\n\n\nBut rational brain is telling me maybe there is hope here and this might be a miracle drug like Diazepam is for my daily PTSD. Does anyone take it or have any help on what to expect versus Temazepam? Thank you",

At the time, I was 17 and had an extremely toxic home life that made me do literally anything to get out of that situation (anything including doing or acting in certain ways for my abuser/employer to get extra money to leave my house). While I did eventually get out, I only recently processed the trauma last year. These past 4 years have been as healing as they have been hard. \n\nI had a trauma anniversary a few weeks ago and couldn‚Äôt so much as eat or look in the mirror without sobbing.

    "title": "Ex from almost 2 years ago still blames me for everything pt 1",
    "selftext": "      Where do i start. Well im going to start with some background information.\nmy ex best friend. Her name was taleah and now i call her lsl (lopsided llama) as a code name. I was friends with this questionable girl for a bit and my litte sister still is. Well Im no longer friends with this girl after this whole situation took place and im glad shes no longer in my life. (She comes into the story later on)\n      I used to be with this guy named kei or is it michael or is it erebus. Idk anymore tbh he changes his name like he changes his underwear. I was introduced to him by an ex of mine, honestly dont know why i trusted him but i stupidly did. Well the ex that set us up also introduced me to the friend group (they come into the story later on). \n     He lives in New Jersey and i lived in Pennsylvania at the time so it was a long distance thing. When we first started dating everything was fine until 3-4 months into the relationship, that was our grace period. We were together for a total of a year and 4 months. He started to show his true colors around the 4 month mark. He started to seem kinda sick of me tbh but i was too blind to see it. We would fight a lot, we fought more towards the last few months of our relationship than we ever did. people have tried to say i was cheating on him on numerous occasions, I was not. The first time someone sent him random iMessage screenshots. I didnt have a phone number nor did i use imessage, i used an app called textnow which is basically the same thing as a normal service provider but also different at the same time. He blocked me, sent the screenshots to literally everyone in the group and refused to talk to me directly. He used people in the group to talk to me. Well after spiraling into a depression (ended up self harming because of the situation) and panic cuz i was so confused about the whole situation, i was literally in the dark about what was going on. Eventually someone (cant remember who specifically sent it) sent me the screenshots i had mentioned. 2 things i noticed that were off about them; 1) that wasnt how i text and 2) the little white slide bar that the iphone x and above have, i used a first generation iphone se with the home button at the time (yes im just as shocked as you are that the thing still worked in 2022). Well i brought these things up to the group and they refused to hear it. I pulled some strings to make him talk to me and actually talk shit out (i called his dad). Calling his dad worked. I brought the screenshots to our chat and pointed out said details i had previously mentioned. He didnt believe me of course and it took a lot of convincing to get him to listen to the facts. Eventually everything went back to somewhat normal after that. That was 7 months into the relationship. Weve had continuous arguments about other things like my dad and sister not liking him (he pulled the race card, it wasnt a race thing my family didnt like how he was treating me) and school officials teaming up with the cops to do something to him (also pulled the race card with that too. If they were truly after him they would‚Äôve done something already as they have everything they need to find him right in their hands). Just bull crap like that constantly. We had lots of petty arguments that didnt even need to be an argument. \n      Heres where things spiral and spiral really fast and badly. Fast forward to maybe the last month of our relationship where lopsided llama comes into play. I had just turned 18 February 1st of 2023. Lsl takes me out about a week after my 18th and we go shopping, i get my 3rd tattoo, and overall had a good day just the 2 of us. The first good day i had in a long time. I didnt have kei spamming my phone constantly (it died so i didnt see anything til i got home). Well when i finally get my phone charged up i had gotten idk how many instagram calls and texts from him and the group. I had literally told them all that i was going out with a friend for a birthday shopping trip and surprise tattoo they didnt know about just the night before so i wasnt going to be on my phone or anything. Well that really didnt end well. ‚ÄúWhere have you been all day‚Äù ‚Äúwhy didnt you answer our calls or texts‚Äù ‚Äúwhy didnt you get on fortnite‚Äù boy i was out having a birthday shopping spree with my friend that i had told you about ahead of time why are you on my ass about it. Its not the first nor last time thats ever happened during that relationship. I couldbt even go to the grocery store with my own mother without my phone getting blown up. (Oh did i forget to mention he had to have all my logins on everything. I didnt have any of his. Forgot to mention that earlier and trying to edit what was already typed is a pain in the ass on here.) fast forward another week, lsl invites me to meet some people. She brought me to meet some of her college friends (an apartment of 4 guys and one of their friends. She was sleeping with 3 of the guys mentioned, tried getting in both the other guys pants). Well the whole night i was getting blown absolutely tf up. I had told him the night before i was going to meet some new people. The beginning of the night it was just me, lsl, and b. Im not going to mention any of their names for their privacy. B picks me and taleah up and we go to round one which is an arcade/bowling alley. At some point while we were there i got a sharp pain in my left big toe. I take my shoe off and what do we have? A piece of glass in my toe. For context i didnt know there was glass in my shoe even tho i literally shaked out my shoes before putting them on. How did the glass get there? Im assuming it was a piece that flew from a glass cup i broke in my room (because of kei, he really pissed me off just a few days before and the glass didnt even get cleaned up off the floor til weeks later tbh). Well i flag lsl over like hey i need help and she sends b over. I tell him generally ‚Äúhey i need a napkin or something to soak up this blood and help me to the nearest table please if you wouldnt mind, somehow there was a piece of broken glass in my shoe.‚Äù He gets me a napkin and helps me over to the table (tbh im a big baby when it comes to getting hurt) and lsl since she worked in a nursing home she had that sticky stretchy tape stuff in her bag so she gave me some to secure the napkin for the time being. We decide as a group right then lets go to b‚Äôs apartment so i dont gotta do much more walking but still have some fun as a group. Before we left i went to call my mom to let her know where we were going and what had just happened and all of a sudden my phone that was at more than 50% charged just 10 minutes prior was all of a sudden dead. I had an ongoing issue with that phone doing that just randomly üòê never figured out why it did that. I asked lsl for hers to call her but her phone was about dead so i asked b and he let me borrow it. Called my mom and explained what just happened and what our plans were after that. We get to b‚Äôs apartment and all the guys were there. Lsl introduces me to the rest of them. We all get settled in we get my phone on a charger and we all start getting to know each other. About 10 minutes into everything my phone powers on and im immediately blown up by phone calls from kei and the group. In that moment i get a phone call from kei. As soon as i pick up the facetime and put it on max volume (my speakers were trash and thats how you could hear anything out of it) you hear is him screaming and cussing accusing me of cheating yet again. Something i had forgotten about was the confederate flag right on the wall behind me. That was ad‚Äôs (there are 2 boys in that apartment with A names for context on that) and kei got all upset and started screaming and cussing about that too. I repeated ‚Äúim not cheating i literally just met them and i have nothing to do with that flag‚Äù about 2 minutes into that FaceTime call i end up saying ‚Äúblah blah blah were done with this conversation‚Äù *hangs up*. He starts blowing up my phone again and again and again and again. He does not quit. All the boys listening to that phone call gets concerned for my safety and asked if im ok. I explained this isn‚Äôt anything new and idk whats going on with him this time but it was really mentally draining. Kei keeps callin and callin and callin. I eventually answered again and said ‚Äúdude im out right now which i had already told you about the day before stop calling me and we will sort this out later‚Äù *hangs up*. He doesn‚Äôt stop there. I get more into detail about whats going on and his delusional behavior and how he always pulled the race card and blah blah blah. They tell me i should leave him. I tell them that i agree with them but i also loved him at the same time. Later that night i get home and call kei back. Hes screaming and cussing like before in a group call for that fact dragging everyone in the group involved (cuz he knows they will ride his dick and not side with me). He accuses me of cheating again and this and that. I tell him i got hurt, he didnt believe it. Showed him where the glass stabbed me and he was still not believing but let it go for the night and we hopped on Fortnite. A few days later i hang out with b and lsl again. Roommates were out working. Same shit happens again. It became a cycle each time. We leave after a few hours, b drops off lsl then takes me home. Well i ask him to park in the cemetery which is right next to my house and ask him if hes comfortable being a witness to this phone call. He agrees and shit of course goes bad again. I hang up just fed up and stsrt crying. He comforted me and dropped me off at home once i calmed down. We had exchanged socials by that point. Well 2 days later he asks me if i wanted to help him DoorDash. I agree cuz i got nothing better to do with my day while kei was at school tbh. We take a little break and head to his apartment so we could charge up our phones and his vape. Thats when lsl calls and says ‚Äúur hanging out without me?‚Äù We handle her explain and go on about our day. Well later that night as hes going to drop me off kei calls again like he did all fucking day. We pull into the cemetery and again b is a witness and shit spirals. I cry again tell b i dont feel safe going home since everyone was asleep and i had thoughts of hurting myself and at that moment i felt like he was the only person i could trust. He takes me back to his apartment we get situated. He gives me his bed and he slept on the floor and the roommate he shared a room with (al) slept on his bed on the other side of the room. Eventually we both fall asleep. I did make sure to let my mom know i wasn‚Äôt coming home that night. The next day when i get home mom‚Äôs obviously concerned so i gave her the details and told her i was alright for the moment. I particularly liked hanging out with b so i start hanging with him more often. Lsl gets pushed out a bit cuz everyone in the apartment liked me a bit more as i enjoyed several similar interests. I actually felt like i fit in you know? Shit continues to happen with kei (why wouldnt it) and i keep getting more and more of a hatred for him. I start growing feelings for b. Eventually during one of my fights with kei i end it with him in front of b bc i was so fed up with everything. I ask b to stay the night at his olace again cuz i wasnt in a good headspace. I let my mom know again that i wasnt gonna be home. Of course im getting blown up by kei and the group. I just ignored it all. My mom dad and sister end up driving to the apartment the next day. Who told them the address? Lsl did. Well we all end up getting in a fight and by that point everyone was home so it was all their business. Dad tries to force his way in and theyre like no thats not happening ur not coming in my house. Dad kicks me out then they all leave. They call the police for a wellness check and ofc im not in danger so they couldnt do anything. Pt2 coming tomorrow ive been at this for over an hour now.",

    "title": "needing advice for dealing with mentally ill friend in 2025",
    "selftext": "Short background summary: Dealing with friend who has Social anxiety from past experiences. Has a therapist who sometimes help but sometimes isn't that great. Tried meds but didnt work. Met him when he was in bad emotional state but through motivational speeches and advices addressing his different problems, I was able to somewhat cheer him up and get in a better state. However, he still has his problems and still can fall into depressive moods. I have helped him through 2¬†`suicide`¬†attempts (may and june.) but the advice speech i came up with in early december has done the best so far. Yes I have set boundaries and realised I am not a fixer and whatnot, but he's in my classes and I can run but I can't hide. Also I can't speak to a therapist myself due to an issue I ran into accessing the NHS but thats a story for another day.\n\nNow to the present. It's xmas break and I already know the differenty ways to act depending on his mood. For example, if he's acting super depressed, i'll give him tissues and say \"here's 5 minutes to cry and let it all out.\" If he's ranting, I'll try to show a different perspective or give advice on that matter. If he's sitting there looking a mildly depressed and not talking alot, I'll either send him to the dining hall to face his fear then he'll feel productive and less worthless, abruptly say a motivatonal speech related to something I think he's worrying about and hope for the best or take him to the school library to use the computers in hopes he will cheer up. The first one has worked the most. If he's looking \"happy\" then I'll try steer the conversation away from mental health to keep him distracted. if he's hanging out with other friends then i'll take a break on my own to recharge and prevent devloping compassion fatigue.\n\nFor 2025, I need to plan on how to \"deal with\" him so he dosen't fall into depression or¬†`suicidal thoughts.`Now I know you guys are gonna say \"It's not your responsibility\" but unfortunatley the persons/organisations which are supposed to be responsible are not cutting it. The HOY said to my friend last academic year\" If no one likes you can come to me.\" Like who thought it was a good idea to reconfirm a cognitive distortian, especially one a mentally ill person holds. This made him even worse. As for the other teachers the best thing they can do is refer him into school counsellor and thats just the same thing as therapy which he already has. His therapist sometimes gives out good advice but the time she gave out bad advice was during his worst time mentally (same time as suicide attempt) so it's 50/50 on the therapist side. His parents are paying for his therapy and there's not much else they can do.\n\nThis leaves me to do a sizeable amount of work supporting him so he dosen't fall into anything worse. Here's a table of the advices/speeches which did and didn't work\n\n|Did Work|Didn't Work|\n|:-|:-|\n||\n|Social skills will matter less as everyone will be focusing on their GCSE rather than socialising|You Need to be more grateful|\n|All girls talk shit about people, don't worry, it's not just you.|It's all in your head|\n|It's not what being said, it's who's saying it.|You're not worthless|\n|People don't care enough about you to hate you|Stop caring what people think (I made up a speech that worked for a few weeks but I think it's human nature to care what people think)|\n|People are not ruminating about how you did something wrong the same way you are. ( I didn't say exactly this but I said something similar which kind of worked.|Find things to love about yourself|\n|School football gets very competitive and people will even scold their friends for making mistakes. Don't take their criticisms too personally.|You need to stop crying and complaining and surf through the waves in life.|\n|You're on your own path in life. (Related to a YouTube video he watched about overcoming jealousy)|Embrace your unique personality|\n\nThe list can go longer but this is just a brief summary. I hope you had a clearer picture from the table above. What I'm asking for is:\n\n* What other pieces of advice/speeches you know of I can deliver to him? The problems he still has are things like \"I hate myself,\" \"I'm awkward,\" a people-pleasing habit of buying food when they don't have money on their account, fear of crowds, etc. He has solved/improved on problems like not taking mean comments personally or not getting jealous through my motivational speeches, but problems still arise and can worsen into depression. I need speeches to cheer him up.\n* Should I get him to do exposure therapy or should I leave it at giving advice?\n* Should I adress his people pleasing problem? He says it stops him from getting depressed and suicidal but that seems like that could go wrong. I was thinking about explaining the quote \"Give an inch and take a mile\" but I feel as he wouldn't respond to that well as this habit keeps him happy.\n* What do I say when he says \"there's nothing good about me\" or \"i hate my life\"?\n\nThank you for reading. If there's more advice you can give which I haven't asked for, please share it.",

My purpose in life became to protect my mum by physically becoming a barrier between her and my much stronger dad, by yelling at my dad to \"distract\" him from his rage towards her. The abuse got so bad that my mum had attempted suicide multiple times. Whenever I would act as a mediator, my mum would proudly say how I was her protector (as if my trauma was something to feel proud about). She would also yell at me and fervently shame me if I tried to get help. \n\nI felt like I was going crazy. I had to come up with plans and ways to be docile and not express any negative feelings and always diffuse the situation and be a good girl and do what my dad says, lest he gets enraged and take it out on my mum. \n\nSuppressing my feelings and my needs became a survival mechanism. \n\nOne time, my mum was visiting her family, and my dad and I went to a party, and I got a panic attack so I sat in the corner. My dad took it as me being antisocial and became enraged. Even though I said I was fine and we didn't have to leave (cause he really wanted to be there), the fact I wasn't socializing, putting on a happy face made him angry beyond words. He dragged me to the car, and got severe road rage while it was just us two in the car. He sped down the highway, screaming at me, while threatening to kill us both. I was scared for my life and crying my eyes out. I thought I was going to die that day. \n\nFast forward to college, I moved as far away from home as I possibly could, got therapy and medication and was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, depression and PTSD. My mum found out that my dad had been cheating on her for more than a decade and they fought like crazy. He wanted to leave her to be with his mistress so he beat her up and kicked her out of the house. She kept going back to him even amidst this because she wanted to \"save her marriage\" and because she was scared about having no job and being financially dependent on him. He ended up abusing her even harder and trying to kill her. \n\nOne time, when I was visiting from college, my mum and her family hatched a plan to take me to my dad's house to \"reawaken his fatherly feelings so that he would take us back\". What fucking bullshit. They dragged me to his house as I screamed, cried and begged not to go there because I was tired and terrified of the abuse we would go through. Surely enough, once we we there, my dad started abusing us (kicking my mum, pushing me around, etc). I locked my mum and myself into the bedroom to keep us safe and begged my mum to call her family to come pick us up as I was shaking and bawling my eyes out (I thought he was going to kill us that day) and my mum told me to shut up and that we had to be there. I was flabbergasted at how nonchalant she was. She didn't do anything (just sat on the bed and expected me to protect her). My dad broke down the bedroom door lock and I was scared for my life. The fight ended with my mum finally calling her family for help and to come pick us up, hours after I had started begging for her to do so. When I got back to my mum's family home, i found out about their plan all along. I was the lamb my mum and her family was willing to sacrifice to 'keep my mum's marriage together\".  That was the day I realized that my mum really did not see me as a person. She was willing to put my life at stake so easily. I have resented my mum since and I will never trust nor forgive her. \n\nFast forward to today:\n\nThankfully, my mum and I are safe and away from the monster now.\n\nMy mum's and family's narrative has always been that my mother was the only victim. Because I wasn't there when my dad beat her up so bad that she ended up in hospital because he was trying to kill her, and I wasn't there when he kicked her out of the house. Even if I was away at college then, I grew up witnessing this abuse. For them, witnessing abuse is not abuse.  However, everytime my mum talks about it, she talks about how \"she\" (not we) got hurt. About things \"she\" (not we) lost. I woke up one random Tuesday and realized my dad was never gonna let me or my mum into the house again and I've lost everything that was in my childhood home instantly without getting a chance to say goodbye.  Yet nobody even acknowledges that. For my mum and my mum's family, there was only one victim to the situation. On top of that, the family taunts me by saying things like: \"You don't know what your mother went through.\" As if I did not go through anything. As if I didn't come into their home, shaking and bawling my eyes out cause my dad hurt me after their stupid plan didn't work.\n\nWhy is it when I talk about being hurt, my mum scoffs and says I wasn't as badly hurt as her.  Why is it that everytime I try to talk about my abuse, the family goes: \"yeah but your mum had it worse.\" It seems like there is no place for two victims in their narratives. \n\n I feel gaslit by everyone around me. \n\nIs growing up being a mediator and witnessing domestic abuse also abuse? Was I also abused?\n\nThank you for listening to me vent. ",

    "selftext": "When I was diagnosed with PTSD somewhere around 2011, they were like, yeah there's nothing we can do about it so just live with it. Now there are so many treatments its overwhelming. And man, oh, man do some of them work! I just wanted to list what has for me and what hasn't. Doctors don't always know, so you have to find a way to educate them without wounding their fragile ego.\n\n1. Prazosin - Not for nightmares! I take 10mg in the morning and 5 mg in the afternoon for intrusive thoughts/memories. It is so effective for this it blows my mind. I want to go to 15mg, 10mg, and 10mg which is off label but they can do, insurance just might refuse to pay for. Avoid sinus medicine, particularly phenylephrine when taking przosin..\n2. \"Brain Wave Treatment\" There are 3 categories, one of which was introduced to me by my psychologist. You put clips on your ears and this little box generates brain waves that have an impact on your brain. This is wildly effective. Alpha-stim works from the first use. Alpha-stim treatment you can get from an $899 device at¬†[www.alpha-stim.com](http://www.alpha-stim.com/)¬†or from a $149 device on Amazon¬†[https://www.amazon.com/Biothm-Device-Relaxation-Vagus-Stimulation/dp/B0CGJHLGTZ](https://www.amazon.com/Biothm-Device-Relaxation-Vagus-Stimulation/dp/B0CGJHLGTZ)¬†that also does Vagus nerve stimulation and Ultra wave therapy.\n3. Alpha-Stim - Stimulates your brain with sleep-like brainwaves to fight anxiety. Works from use 1.\n4. Vagus Nerve - Stimulates the Vagus nerve for direct treatment of PTSD. Takes 2 weeks to produce results and I just started.\n5. Ultra Wave therapy - directly treats PTSD. Takes 2 weeks to work and I just started.\n6. Buspirone/Buspar - fights intrusive thoughts at the maximum use of 10mg 3 times per day. Works, but not as well as prazosin.\n7. Zoloft/Paxil- Antidepressants approve for PTSD. Did NOT work for me and I switched back to Viibryd.\n8. Gabapentin - Works on intrusive thoughts/memories. This is an off label use for this controlled substance, so it can be hard to get a prescription unless you also have nerve pain.\n9. Rexulti - Not sure what part it works on, but it just helps.\n\nAlpha-Stim is incredible. It's really helped me and other members of my family who hav used it for anxiety/insomnia.\n\nGet as many tools as you can and kick PTSD's ass. You don't have to live with that garbage!",

Had a really bad panic attack for 9+ hours straight and it made me extremely overwhelmed with many emotions and physical sensations. A week later, i had my first ever \"normal\" panic attack at dinner with family.\n\n I did extensive research on psychedelics before trying. I figured id be fine and enjoy the trip. I did not. In any way or capacity. If anything, its really traumatized me over the week, getting frequent panic attacks, dissociating, derealizing, constant fight or flight responses, certain objects, images or words/actions really trigger a panic in me bc it reminds me of that night. The bad trip i had REALLY messed with my mental health, if not absolutely destroyed it. All my walls and barriers i built don't seem to exist and i feel so vulnerable, lost and in constant fear of sleeping due to nightmares that make me relive that night. \n\nInsomnia has been the truest issue besides the frequent panic attacks. Im becoming malnutritioned and my body is so exhausted all the time now since i don't sleep very well. I do have Nightmare Disorder on top of this. These are all new feelings ive never handled before besides bad anxiety over my life. My mental health has never been the best either. The bad trip released all my past trauma and stress so it was extremely overwhelming emotionally. Now i don't worry about the past and all those coping mechanisms are not working anymore. I find it a good thing at the trade of making me relive that night everytime i want to sleep or close my eyes. Currently, typing this, im physically sick, stomach eating itself and having a hard time eating. Vomiting is almost immediate if i try eating solid foods. Ive been sipping biolyte and regular water to maintain some health. Its really affecting me mentally too. \n\nNow, my questions are mainly:\n\nWhat coping mechanisms do any of you use that could help me control and build my mental health back in this battle?\n\nAny medications or a type of therapy that has helped in a good amount of time?\n\nIs there anything i can do for myself to learn to build my health back up? Both physically and mentally.\n\nThis is all really new to me to handle, as anxiety was my main issues, now its panic attacks and waking up from that moment of sleep that terrifies me every single night. So any help or advice is appreciated! Much love to y'all! ",

    "selftext": "My following statement comes from a place of true honesty and I apologise if I sound ignorant. I appreciate you for reading this! This is not a sob story. \n\nI was essentially inadvertently bullied in high school. Combine my lack of confidence with a highly agreeable nature, I was an easy target. Especially considering I generally succeeded in other areas (e.g. art, academics, even looks), others were really rough when it came to my weaknesses. Mistreatment from envy is something I‚Äôve experienced since primary school. \n\nWhile my fellow teenage (female) friends didn‚Äôt overtly bully me (e.g. physical abuse, clear discriminatory attacks), I perpetually felt excluded. I cried myself to sleep every night in Grade 8. It felt like I was perpetually misplaced and was made to feel an outcast in many ways. \n\nPE was where most of my trauma developed. It‚Äôs where my largest insecurities took the spotlight. Classmates never picked me for group sports, supposed friends would passively exclude me if it meant they could secure a spot, and their support was inconsistent. So many ‚Äúfriends‚Äù backstabbed me, made cruel passive aggressive jokes, gave me the worst c looks, etc. \n\nAnd I would get this really specific bodily sensation of feeling naked, insecure, on the urge of tears, and being completely and utterly alone. I would become a recluse, withdraw, hide my mind away in an attempt to escape a physically-inescapable situation. I would go silent, lose my enthusiasm, and may even zone out a little. \n\nIssue is, is that every time I am about to participate/am participating in a sports activity (it could be completely casual like chucking a ball around), that feeling comes back again. It‚Äôs the same as what I felt in high school, and all the shitty memories from that time often arise in my mind too, but the feeling varies in intensity. It often gets worse the more I participate and I may not even notice it initially. I subconsciously feel as if something is bound to go wrong and I‚Äôll feel like that little naked teenage girl again. \n\nDoes this align with PTSD symptoms? Never had a panic attack or anything overt, so it‚Äôs really difficult to tell. But it could really help me if you guys could share your related experiences and ideas. Thanks. ",

    "selftext": "It's like the reverse of the in-laws trope.  I love visiting and spending time with my in-laws, and I'm dreading spending time with my family.  Specifically my dad.  \n\nStubbornness runs in the family, and I think he got a double-inheritance from my grandpa.  For whatever reason, he seems to think I'm still ten, even though I've been paying my own taxes for over a decade.  I've been through a few combat zones and seen shit he couldn't dream of, but he insists on treating me like a fucking child.  Ordering me around, giving me chores, expecting me to bow to his whims.\n\nHe also doesn't think highly of my mental health issues.  Thinks it's all an excuse.  Because he made it through his time in the Navy without getting PTSD, so why should I?  Nevermind the fact that the closest he got to a \"combat zone\" was being tangentially involved with Grenada back in the 80's.\n\nAnd god-fobid I try to talk to him about it.  Somehow that's \"undermining him.\"  But at the same time, not visiting them is somehow the end of the world.  My wife and I booked a hotel room so we wouldn't have to stay with them in the house, we would have our own space and everything, and now my mom is offended.  I tried using my bad back as an excuse, since they always put us on the futon that they've had since I was in high school, but she's still trying to guilt me on it.\n\nI'm just sick and tired of their bullshit.  Thinking about dealing with their shit makes me want to drink.",

    "title": "was I abused?",
    "selftext": "Dear reddit, no one else cares about my story other than you guys, I am so glad you people exist, any ways, here is the story of how I, a Chinese American Male, was abused by my Stepbrother. Let me know in the comment section if I was wrong and I was not abused.\n\nI was born in China in 1989, I came to the states in 2002, I lived with my biological mom and step father In NY. My step father had 4 children, 2 of them were already grown adults and lived on their own. The white man in question is his youngest one, who is older than me by 2 years. It‚Äôs the year 2007, in the apartment we lived in its just me, mom and step dad. This white man, who I shall hide his real name and call him Sam, Sam is a drug addict, who had just flunked out of college where he had a full scholarship, then he went to drug rehab and failed out of that as well for drug use. Some how during this year 2007, my mom and step dad agreed to let him live with us, in 2007 I was a senior in high school, from this moment until middle of 2008 was the hardest period of my life where I endured the most abuse. I will list the things he‚Äôs done while at the apartment with me and mom and step dad.\n\n1.¬†¬†¬†¬† One day I went to the dentist for surgery, afterwards I was prescribed a bottle of oxycodone, while I was in the car with Sam and my mom, Sam asked to see my medication, I gave it to him, then a little bit later I ask for it back, Sam asked me, do you want to be addicted? And will not hand back the bottle, I did not know what to say, my mom saw this and said ill hold onto it, and Sam give it to mom. Later I confronted Sam about this and asked what was he plan to do with the pills, he said he was prob going to take it him self.\n\n2.¬†¬†¬†¬† In the apartment where we lived I lived in my own room while Sam just crashed in the living room, at night I usually lock my door. One day Sam came to me, and asked me to stop locking my door at night, I said no, then Sam asked me, what if there is a fire? At first I said no but he asked me what if there is a fire every day for a week and I eventually gave in and unlocked my door at night, its either that night or later nights I woke up in the middle of the night seeing Sam rifling through my belongs in my room.\n\n3.¬†¬†¬†¬† In the day time, Sam would spend time in the living room watch TV, when step dad would come home, step dad would watch programs Sam did not like, so Sam tried to move a TV into my room, he could not lift the TV by him self, so he asked for my help, I decline, then he said do you want me to punch you in the face? I knew Sam had a violent past where he was in multiple fights and growing up he was very physical, so I was a little scared, then end up helping him to move TV into my room.\n\n4.¬†¬†¬†¬† Sam once came down with a lung infection, one day in the hall we were both there at the same time, and Sam just purposely coughed on me in the direction of my face, few days later I got the same infection.\n\n5.¬†¬†¬†¬† One day the topic of my drivers license came up, and he asked to see it, I gave it to him, and later I ask for it back, Sam doesn‚Äôt want to give it back to me and say what if you lose it? Only after asking for it back a few times Sam just slam my card onto the floor.\n\n6.¬†¬†¬†¬† One night I think it was me and Sean came back from blockbuster, Sean walked past a house and told me he would rob this house, not exact phrase but something similar.\n\n7.¬†¬†¬†¬† One night we walked past an ATM, Sean checked the ATM and told me he would take money if there was money there or an account open.\n\n8.¬†¬†¬†¬† Multiple times Sam literally asked me if I want him to slit my throat.\n\n9.¬†¬†¬†¬† When I was in high school I wanted to be a doctor, and Sam knew it and one day he told me I better get him drugs when I am a doctor, I said no, I would call the cops on you, then Sam said do you know what Italians do to snitches?\n\n10. I remember vividly that Sam wanted me to sell drugs for him.\n\n11. Once earlier than 2007, he was smoking cigarettes, his friend was there, and Sam literally said to his friend something along the lines I am going to get him to do it too, Sam asked me do you want a cigarette? I said no, Sam then said how do you know you don‚Äôt like it if you never tried it?\n\n12. One day Sam admitted to me that he stolen medications from his mother who was suffering from cancer at that time.\n\n13. Later I found out from mom that he stolen my mom‚Äôs jewelry.\n\n14. He drove his dads car without permission, and he proudly boasts it to me, later step dad said he found out he was driving his car because he left the window down.\n\n15. At the end of Sam‚Äôs stay at the apartment Sam asked me why do I think he did what he did, I said I don‚Äôt know, Sam said because he wanted me to be tough.\n\n16. I found out later that Sam only left our apartment because my step dad had told him he should go back to upstate NY to take care of his mom who is suffering from cancer, and then later he can come back. Sam left in the middle of 2008 I believe.\n\n17. Sam later lived down at Florida where he once again failed out of rehab, but that stint in 2008 was the last time I saw him in person.\n\n18. Sam would go on to commit felonies in the state of Florida where he served a few years in prison.\n\n19. I gotten back in touch with Sam for the purpose of confronting him about what he has done, seems like Sam thinks very highly of him self and just admits he occasionally did things he was not proud of, like as in he‚Äôs a good guy just made mistakes from time to time\n\n¬†\n\nJust a personal statement here, I know I made a lot of mistakes too by being too trusting but I guess you live and learn. Much of who I am today was shaped by these very moments.",

I can‚Äôt even bathe without having a meltdown.\n\n**My question is if you have successfully had an EMDR provider bill you personally (give you a detailed statement), submitted it to your MVA insurance, have they agreed to pay for it?**\n\n-I‚Äôm finding that most of the EMDR providers in my area (I don‚Äôt want to do it online) don‚Äôt accept PIP coverage‚Ä¶ the only other way I could get them to pay for it is if I get the bill from the provider and send it over to my PIP provider.-\n\nDetails, if anyone else can relate or has any advice.\n\nIt has been 14 months since the accident. Not only did I have a physical injury, but it was also a total mind F. The driver responsible was uninsured, suspended license, and unregistered vehicle. She committed at least 2 felonies that night in addition to violating several serious traffic laws. She had warrants out for her arrest AND illegal things in her possession (too upsetting to even list).\n\nWhat was her ‚Äúpunishment‚Äù? TWO NIGHTS in jail. She was never charged for anything, and I will be disfigured for life.\n\nThe injury I sustained was worse than we initially expected. I was told I needed surgery on my right (dominant) elbow 12 months ago and to prove to my insurance that I was trying everything conservative first, I did all of it but it didn‚Äôt get better. It‚Äôs a long story but my surgery kept getting pushed out. \n\nFast forward to now, I had my surgery 2 weeks ago and recovery has been horrible. I‚Äôve had to keep it elevated and because it is my dominant side, I can‚Äôt grip or use a turning motion (like turning a doorknob) for at LEAST 4 more weeks!!!! The healing isn‚Äôt going to really end until the end of 2025.\n\nBefore the car accident I‚Äôve experienced trauma but this accident caused flashbacks and dissociation for the first time in my life. The worst part is that I‚Äôm not even the same person anymore. \n\nI curse this woman daily. I‚Äôm trying to find out what my rights are but it‚Äôs very complicated because it was an uninsured motorist so insurance companies will put up even more of a fight because it‚Äôll be a total loss.\n\nAnyway if you got this far, thanks for reading.\n\n\n",

The war happened before my life. All our life he was very impatient when we didnt understand him. He would go fumes if trying to prove him wrong. Maybe in earlier days we could reason with him. But all my life I remember him as a father who took care of us.\n\n--- Will for control\n\nAbout 5-10 years ago, I dont remember when it started he would discipline us, try to control us.\nWhen we would reason with him, we would always be in the wrong, even if we were right. Im talking delusional level of reasoning. I would make breakfast he would comment and microcontrol the way I make breakfast. I just wanted to make breakfast but he had a better way and I had to sit down and watch. Usually ends up being longer than I initially planned on making because of all the explaining why. Some kind of perfectionism. You tried to tell him to take it easy that that is not my priority right now, he would get mad for not having control over this issue. I've wrote this just so readers can have a somewhat better understanding of what im talking about.\n\n--- The clash between the two\n\nMy brother has a wife and kids in the same house. My brother and his wife werent so disciplined and were irregular with their way of living (not always on time, lazy and so on) and trying to dodge fathers microcontrol. Father noticed that he was being dodged and it was like this for years. He got mad with it 1 week ago and he started raising his voice at them both infront of a 1.5 year old son.\nMy brother got defensive, father started threatening. My brother punched him 3 times to his chin/jaw from side.\nBrother, his wife and kids packed up and left the house. My father started drinking, still not blaming himself for the uproar (i blame both parties for not trying to make space for middle ground).\n\n--- The aftermath\n\nTODAY, my brother went to pick up some left over stuff from the house. We packed up 2 cars and went to his new place.\n\nIn the meantime mother called and asked \"Who's going to pick me up from work?\" I've said that I dont have my own car with me that as father drove her to work, he didnt get back to the house.\nShe said she will call him and see where he is. Considering that she didnt call back, we assumed he went to her workplace. As we were driving we saw my car crashed at the side of the road into a small canal. I saw him standing there, on phone talking to someone. My head went red and hot. I didnt even stop to check anything, since 5 sec after mom called and said if we know about the crash. He, on alcohol, 100m from her workplace, tried to SMS her that he is arriving soon. And the crash happened that way.\n\n--- Where I stand on this\n\nIm usually trying to be stoic about such situations, accepting fate as it is and materialistic items are not here forever.\nI was always the good image of a son, I dont smoke, i spend less, dont go out clubbing. I bought my own car with saved up money, again saved money enough to buy the same car again and have money still in bank\n\n--- He started changing\n\nFor the first time ever, in a short period of time, I've heard my father cry. That hurt me quite a lot aswell. Knowing what he had to go through life, work hard to make this large house, only to not be able to control himself anymore. He never did weird acts such as these days. He rolled down the car window during a rush hour and catcalled a woman. During lunch, he somehow made himself say that my mother sucked his d-d. (Not sure about profanity rules here so writing like this)\nSomething started happening with him.\n\n--- Next move\n\nMy mother wants me to accept nothing less for the car damages from him, fuming.\nMy father said he will let me choose a car and he will buy it for me, he said it from his grief.\nMy mother will make a divorce with him once this settles, he will have no one.\nI, in honest opinion, from the heart. Dont want him to pay anything. I feel his sorrow and anger at life.\nI dont even know how will he pay since he hasnt worked since 2018. He is in retirement. And now that he has a broken rib since the airbag didnt work, wont be going to work anytime soon.\nMy mom has been calling him lazy, but not infront of him, since he would go mad for any kind of blame and pointing at him.\n\nI'm writing here to have a better understanding of PTSD and understand my father more to make my next decision what is best for him. Please help in a way of an advice. Right now he is still sobering up from alcohol.",

    "title": "Why did I give up?",
    "selftext": "I have never felt like I was going to receive love. My mother was not affectionate or attentive. I was emotionally neglected from birth I assume. My father was physically and psychologically abusive, and my stepmother was a malignant narcissist. I've never been able to believe that people care for me.  Why did I give up on being loved when I was a child? I see so many other people's stories about how they knew they deserved love, and they finally got it after they left the abusive situation. I've never once thought of myself as deserving love. When I was being abused I focused on this being an injustice done upon me. I never questioned if my father loved me. I knew the answer was no. I never asked myself why my mom didn't know my dad was hurting me. I assumed she just didn't care enough, that she had to have known and just never bothered to do anything. I had given up on self preservation by the time i got to 10th grade, started telling all my teachers about the abuse, begging anyone to listen. No one ever did anything. My father had to kick me out of his home so I would stop calling the police on him, and then my mother \"cared\" and took me back to live with her. I don't think she did that out of love. I think she just wanted a bit of superiority over my father. And then we went right back to the emotional neglect I had been treated to as a small child before I lived with my father. It only took 6 months for me to spiral out of control and get institutionalized. I went from not being allowed to leave the house except to go to school to being a latchkey kid overnight. I've always sought attention anywhere I could get it, but I knew that it was never going to be love. Love wasn't real. I'm still wondering if it is. I struggle to accept my partners love and I don't know if I show him that I love him enough. I care for him so much and would be devastated if he were to leave me. Part of me believes that he does not really care for me at all, despite his affirmation and action. He continues to try to show me that he cares for me, but my innermost self still is waiting for the floor to drop out and return me to loneliness. Why can't I move past this feeling? He has proven time and again that he is not going anywhere. We've been through some awful stuff and are still together despite everything. I just wish I could believe he loves me. I'm sorry if this doesn't belong here, but I'm really struggling with this and my therapist hasn't been able to help. ",

    "title": "Am I having ptsd??",
    "selftext": "I grew up with domestic violence. Last year a close family member broke in and beat me up. I was home alone sleeping naked in my bed and didn't know anything. They drug me around the house, blacked both my eyes, tried to suffocate me. I was screaming as loud as I could hoping a neighbor would hear. They took my phone. I tried to escape out the door once  ( which I was still naked but I didn't care at that point I didn't have any way to get clothes on) and they caught me by by hair and threw me down. I hit my head and it knocked me out and I laid there for a bit stunned before I could get up. I think it may have caused a concussion or fractured my skull because I had massive swelling on the back of my head and the way my eyes bruised, a friend who is a doctor told me I needed a ct when they saw my eyes. I never called the police and told people I accidentally fell.  I started dating someone a while back who has anger issues (didn't know when I started dating them). They have never hit me, but scream and get handsy with me. And make a lot of noise like hitting things and getting right in my face yelling sometimes for hours screaming right in my ears and face. This person has been getting help for the anger issues. Seeing a doctor and been going to anger management classes sometimes daily depending on the outbursts. When they get mad I don't know what to do so I just get quiet and don't engage in yelling. I don't talk because they yell over me and it seems to hype them up but also they get mad that I'm not talking and start hitting or kicking around me and shaking slamming hitting stuff. Or just making so much loud noise. This happens about 2-3 times a month. I think it's broke me. I've been in a state I can't get out of which varies in intensity. At times, I can't hold anything because my hands shake so much and any sound I hear I jump and drop everything. I startle soooooo easily and will scream which can be embarrassing in different settings. I feel crazy because it'll be times I can't stop looking around thinking something's about to get me. Hearing sounds even stuff I know what it is I can't control my body's reaction. My heart feels like it's going to beat out of my chest I can look down and see my shirt moving over my heart beating so hard. And it makes me feel like I'm losing my mind. I try to soothe this anxiety by keeping my mind background engaged in something while I'm doing other things. Anything. YouTube videos audiobooks etc. I always need something to keep my mind occupied to have any peace. How do I get out of this state? I have left the relationship and they are begging me back but I don't think I can mentally handle it even though I know they are trying to get help. ",

    "selftext": "This is just‚Ä¶ a raw memory from when I was a kid, and it's still really hard to deal with. I was six when it happened, and it‚Äôs probably one of the worst things that‚Äôs ever happened to me. I don't remember much before, but what I do remember is being scared out of my mind, being forced into a van with my mom. I was just a little kid, and I remember being all snuggled up in her arms as these two men pushed us into the back. I remember the darkness in that car and the fear, and how helpless I felt as they drove us away. When they finally stopped, my mom tried to act like she wasn‚Äôt scared. I still remember what she told me that night, ‚ÄòEverything‚Äôs going to be okay, baby. Mommy just has to help these men with something real quick. I‚Äôll be right back.‚Äô She kissed me, she even smiled a little, and then she got out of the van with them. I remember feeling like something was off, but I believed her. I'll never forget the look on her face when she left with those men.\n\nI was left alone in the van, and they went inside this abandoned house. It was cold and the van just smelled like liquor and cigarettes. I was just a little kid, sitting there confused and waiting for my mom to come back. The windows were all dirty, so I couldn't see what was happening, but I could hear weird, muffled sounds. It was like, she wasn't crying or anything, but whatever they were doing, it just didn't sound right. It just made me feel sick, you know? I just sat there, alone and scared, wishing she would come back soon.\n\nThen, she came back, but she was like a different person. She looked vacant, emotionless, like‚Ä¶ gone. She tried to smile, but her eyes just looked‚Ä¶broken. She just said she had to help them with something and that it was done, and I still didn't understand what was happening. I remember noticing a big, dark, wet patch in the crotch of her denim shorts. I just remember the fear, the way she looked, the sadness, and that patch. That's a memory I hate, it‚Äôs one that will probably never go away.\n\nThis all happened in 2007 and i was 6 at the time and she was 24. She is alive and well today but sometimes i tend to distance myself from her because the memories and the intense flashbacks just overwhelms me. Do you have any advice on how to deal with this?\n\n",

I've known him since I was 13. He started sexually abusing me when I was 16 and 17.\n\nWhen I told my parents, they stopped all contact with him and pulled my brother and I out from the taekwondo and archery clubs. My brother was only 14 at that time. He did not understand why. My mother explained to him what happened. I couldn't do it. I thought everything was fine until ..\n\nA few months after, I found out my parents allowed him to go out with that guy. I felt shocked and betrayed. I called my mom crying.

My brother was there to help me with a few stuff. But when I saw that guy, I immediately went to my brother to ask him to accompany me outside the arena. I had a full blown panic attack. My brother was there to witness it. This was the first time I saw that guy and heard his voice. But I was working, so I had to shut down and disassociate. A super power of mine.\n\nNow ...

He's the only one that knows and saw it... And I don't ever show that side of me.\n\nNow I hate my brother.

    "title": "My story",
    "selftext": "Let me start by saying no suicide actually happened. Please let me know if I should've used a different CW, though I feel this does cover it (as you'll find later in the story, I don't know how to define my triggers properly). Oh, and it's a long read this - I just started typing, trying to make it a coherent story, until the point that is now.  \n  \nBack in early 2017, I met a girl online from a different country, and it went quite well. We started talking and it soon got to a relationship. But it turned out she had suicidal tendencies and had actually attempted at some point too. The day we started talking she had actually marked in her agenda as the day to try again. I thought it wouldn't be a reason to stop talking or whatever: if I like her, we can talk about it and I can help her a little simply by listening and the rest can still be a nice relationship. A little red flag you can say, but nothing much to worry about. She had also lied about her age, saying she was 18 while being 17 (I was 20 at this point). \"it's only a one year, we don't differ too much\" I thought. A somewhat bigger red flag I skipped you could say. And then she was also very hesitant to show herself, feeling ugly at times. I guess I assumed here that was just a minor thing to get more attention from a boy she liked (me), and would pass over time. I didn't consider this a red flag, but I guess it was. \n\nAnyway, we just talked, a lot over the internet, but I also visited her eventually after like 2 months or something so also in real life. But the way we talked changed, and not for the better. She would try to push me away in the evening \"so I wouldn't miss her when she was gone\", and then the following morning being very sweet and grateful. She would repeatedly say I didn't love her so I'd say I did. When I did say something about it she got mad at me for a whole 3 weeks, something that every time went hand in hand with more threats of suicide. I was scared, extremely. Over the summer holiday, she visited me for the first time, second time we would see each other in real life, immediately a whole 10 days. I lived both in student housing with housemates, and with my parents at the time. In both places, she wouldn't leave my room without me. When I were to leave before her, she'd expect me to return and come get her. We also went to a museum at one point (my mom suggested it; far from my favourite museum, but after the suggestion my gf was set on going there and I didn't feel like pushing back hard or something), and she was constantly hanging on me: literally, physically. That night she asked if I thought she was clingy. I said 'maybe a little': I wasn't going to lie, but still be careful about it. She got upset, started crying, and went straight to sleep. I felt terrible and couldn't sleep at all. She woke up at night finding me crying instead of sleeping and she was all sweet again. She suggested we'd have sex, first time for us both. I wanted some peace and quiet in my mind and thought I wouldn't have to worry about her being upset if we'd have sex so I went for it, she said later that she was scared of losing me and decided having sex would be a good way to manipulate me into staying with her. Needless to say, she didn't need to do that, I was way too scared that she'd end her life to leave her at the time.   \nAfter she left back to her country, I went on holiday with a few friends to another country. She'd had a boyfriend before who'd cheated on her when he left the country. As such, when I left my country, she got scared of it again and went on to treat me as if I had already cheated. On top of still the mentions of wanting to commit suicide. I felt terrible that week. I tried to keep it hidden for my friends, one friend did ask about it and I lied. One night, I felt I wanted to cheat: I didn't, instead upon realizing I felt this way I felt even shittier.   \nThis summer I also went on holiday with my parents and sister. That must have been the worst time I've ever had. I was tired a lot, decided to not go with my parents and sister most of the time. Instead, I felt empty. Not just empty, but like a void was filling me, overflowing. There was nothing in me, nor was there space for anything to be in me. I felt no emotions at all, an agonizing absence of emotions. Looking back, this was the first time I remember having responded to triggers. I remembered a South Park episode, where Butters was crying, but said that the crying made him feel human so it was a good thing. I looked up things that triggered me. Watched, among other things, Anna Akana talk about her trauma. It made me triggered, which made me feel something, something else than that agonizing absence of emotions. I did that a lot too. \n\nCome later, the academic year had started again, and pressure from my girlfriend was increasing. It was no longer listening and trying to talk her through it, it had become a few hours every day without exception of talking her down. I had just started a second bachelors, very interesting but also way out of my comfort zone, which took quite a lot of time. I was also doing a lot of committee work, which I liked but that also took up my time. As such, I was busy a lot. And she knew about this, these weren't new things, but rather things that were already going on when we met. At the start of the year, I was helping with an introduction activity. We were supposed to be two, but the other was sick, so I had to scramble a bit getting everything set up, communicating with people working at other places for the same thing, trying to get materials that weren't where they were supposed to be: stressful, but no biggy, I was used to it, was getting by, but really had to focus. She knew I was doing this. Yet still, she got upset when she saw me going online and offline on WhatsApp (which I had to do for all the communication of course) without responding to her. She said I was \"too busy for her\", and once again got upset about it. Later, still with the hours every day going on, or maybe this happened before the summer, I honestly wouldn't know for certain anymore, I took some spacecake with a housemate. She knew I was doing this, because it'd been planned for a while. It also felt to me like a little escape from all the worries, that I really needed. Her grandma had some medical issues so she was stressed about that. Then, she got upset at me for still taking my, what I would now consider, little break. While being very high, I spent about 6 hours, till 4 AM, trying to get her to calm down and that I was still the same person, while being very high at the same time. At one point, at like 3 AM, I told her she looked like a painting, which she took as a compliment but those were literally the visuals I was seeing at the time. It was exhausting, I was exhausted. I hadn't been able to enjoy weed for like a year, and far from as much for another 2 years on top of that. These are just the stories that I still have the strongest memories of, linked to specific instances like the painting thing or the too busy for her thing, but more happened. And all of it came down to either me having to calm her down, or her getting upset at me trying to claim some space for myself (followed by me having to calm her down - calming down nearly always also included talking her down from suicide). Not to mention the mood swings from going from full dosis antidepressants  for a few weeks, back to none a day later and maintaining that for a while, and then straight back up to full dosage.\n\nIt all went wrong at the start of October, so just over a month into the new academic year. She thought she might have gotten pregnant from dry humping (pants getting wet on both our ends, so extremely unlikely). At first I was trying to be supportive, but quickly she got more into the idea of her wanting to keep the baby, which made me realize that while still studying and being in a different country, this was the last thing I'd want. If I were to become a father, I'd want to be able to be there for my kid and in that situation I wouldn't be. But more importantly, we didn't know if she was actually pregnant. She refused to take a pregnancy test and instead just accept herself as being pregnant and wanting to be treated as such. I had to pressure her into getting one. She had a friend buy one for her, and then had me reimburse that friend (note, I had and still have quite some student debt and she quite a bit of money saved up for her studying. But because she was nervous about her money, there was never any space to openly discuss how to handle finances): she turned out not to be pregnant. At this point I was near completely socially withdrawn, trying to hold up posture in public so people wouldn't find out. The following monday I woke up, crying. I went to my morning lecture and was constantly holding back tears. In the break, I went to the toilet and cried. I stayed there until I felt I could hold my tears back for at least a little while. I went to the bus, crying, got on, messaged my parents I was coming and I just kept crying the entire day. I told them the basics, and with their help broke up with my gf. First called her mother, was very clear that she would attempt to take her life. My gf turned out to be taking a nap. I woke her up and broke up with her. I stayed home that week, called off a meeting I had and didn't go to lectures. I felt empty, broken, merely a shell. After a few days, I got a message from my gf's friend, that my gf wanted to talk. She tried getting back together, and I gave in. I felt a bit less like a shell with her I guess. Turns out, she was no longer suicidal. After this point, not a single mention of her wanting to take her life anymore. After working to get back together, she did force me to apologize to her mother for scaring her, which I did. \n\nAfter that, I decided I wanted to take some control back again. Every time she did something that triggered me (still didn't call it that or whatever), I would say something along the likes of \"hey, what you just did here reminded me of what you did back then. I don't see you as the person who did that, and I don't expect you to remember this, but I do want to just say it\". Looking back, that felt like a good thing I did, it got quite a few things out of my system. (Beyond that, I was still socially withdrawn, though getting by with my studies) She didn't like that, she didn't want to see herself separate from the person that was constantly pressuring and manipulating me with suicide for over half a year. Anyway, things went on, things still weren't good but it felt better than just me with my broken self and I had claimed a little bit of space for myself in the relationship finally too. There were still things going on like her at one point telling me I didn't love her, just the relationship and letting me deal with that, and me at one point randomly saying it back (I don't know why, it came out of my mouth before I could even see those words as being possible of being spoken) and her crying and getting upset. There were two points when she was doubting the relationship and rather than talking about it decided to test me in the most horrible way possible (threatening to outright break up without any talk if I didn't do exactly as she said I should and should not do), and then when I went to talk about it, both times, we had a good talk and she liked it and I'm like wtf why you treat me like that. One day, over 1.5 years into the relationship, I decided to not be the first to message her in the morning. Instead of just saying 'hey', she sent a GIF with 'OK' and expected me to be able to respond to that, and then was upset that I didn't send her anything first. She had this friend that liked her a lot and she was never able to just clearly say how she wanted their friendship to look like and instead complained to me about him, while still seeking him for relationship advice, or another friend who tried kissing her and she thought it was so hard to clearly say no. A lot happened still. The breakup was also a weird one, where we had planned for her to come over and she was already doubting that, but then she would to just see if it was still worth it, but after she left she just never said anything about it. I had to ask and she was expecting me to just know it from thin air. This was all around new years 2018/2019.\n\nWe kept in touch. I'd send her a single image over facebook messenger at random intervals of about a week (or so was the idea) and she'd do the same just to show that at least we still thought of each other. But then she wanted it more and more often, which I didn't like. She'd said her 30 minute piece about all the things that weren't as nice during the relationship, and when I tried doing that myself a few days later to get it out of my system too and be on equal footing, she stopped me as soon as possible and gave another 30 minute piece including accusing me of >!rape!< (avoiding accidental triggers here, discussion with my therapist has gotten to the point that this was an unfounded accusation btw, but it kept me worried for years). We said that if someone came along our path to date, we could, so she got a date and then immediately on the first date also a new boyfriend within a month (I thought we'd first date, see what happens, and then into relationship), who she described as looking like me but less handsome, though treating her like a princess - something which finally made things click: she didn't want me, she wanted a good looking person and be treated like a princess and thought I checked the first box and was kind enough to possibly check the second box as well (not listening to all the times I'd said that I see a relationship as a place where people are equals). Two months later I started dating another girl and after a month that became a relationship. My first gf thought that breaking up would mean that we'd no longer have to talk about my issues, and even got upset at me for doing so at one point. She did bring up that her brother had suicidal tendencies at one point. I could muster up not a single grain of sympathy. Being so apathetic to something like that made me feel terrible. I found out that there was nothing in me left that wanted to stay in touch with her in any way whatsoever. I blocked her all ways I could think of and haven't spoken with her since. My mom staying friends with her mom over facebook for a while though. She found out that my first gf got engaged within a year and her first child after a second year. That was the life she wanted apparently, and she traumatized me trying to get there.\n\nMy last girlfriend did a lot for me. She didn't know it btw, thinking I did more for her and she gave very little back, nor did I know it either - I was just happy and gave what I believed she deserved, which subliminally apparently was a lot. She has depression and taught me that antidepressants are not something you should ever quit cold turkey, and that depression is not a bad thing in a relationship as long as the person dealing with it knows how to handle it. I could be there for her without her making it my responsibility. She taught me sex could be fun. My first gf, it felt eventually, thought of it as a task a woman should have towards her man. My next gf saw it as an activity you do together that makes both feel good and you could even have a little fun with each other too. And I could tell her things, just snippits here and there, the trauma hadn't hit me as hard it feels like as it did later on, but I could get by. My emotions were muted, I had a lot of difficulty being happy or excited, but I could be contend and in love and that was good enough for me. \n\nThat relationship lasted 2.5 years. She broke up with me, and it felt awful. I was getting overworked at my first job (teacher, while doing a full-time masters to get a teaching degree) when she broke up with me and soon after my dad was taken up into hospital for COVID (he still lives btw). I had to move back to my parents which was another stressor, plus I didn't like their cooking and wasn't given much space to cook for myself instead, meaning I lost quite a lot of weight, soon after which I also moved to my current living space - a full top floor to myself with 3 housemates and a cat that I've been living in for just over 3 years now. A lot happened. A week or 2 from now three years ago is also the first time I remember myself telling someone I had a trauma, and I think before that I must've said something similar like 2 or 3 times, but then calling it a minor trauma. Still not realizing I had PTSD. Just being very overworked and empty, easily overwhelmed, and the second week of January being triggered for a full week because of an actual completely innocent joke about how birds must feel a bit tired of life when they get too close to our cat. I did have dissociations (though I didn't know that's what they were) at the time, with me just standing for a few minutes, blanking out completely, most of the time when no-one was around. One thing I did really detest was that I had a grudge towards my second girlfriend. I didn't understand it, looking at the memories how she was, how she still was because we were keeping in touch, I couldn't find any reason to feel that way towards her. I logically could only think of being grateful, for all the things she had done for me by just simply being there and how that hugely outweighed the breakup.   \nIt wasn't till the summer holiday of 2022, my first one being single since 2017, that it clicked. After a week, maybe 2, I started feeling a hole in me that needed filling and I didn't know how. I began to obsessively look for any human contact, and once I realised what I was doing I withdrew and felt straight up unhappy for a whole week. At the end of the week, I had a shroom trip planned. I remembered from previous trips how the 'hangover' would be feeling euphoric for a few weeks, and I felt I really needed that. I shouldn't have gone on that trip btw, but I still did. I also, in the week before, read the I Ching, following an interest in Daoism I'd built up, and gave myself an oracle, general advice for the coming 5 years. My oracle said \"he is blessed from above. Nothing that is not beneficial\". Anyway, I went on the trip, hottest day ever in my country, and I felt unable to connect to the others as I had been able during previous trips. I was faking it, trying not to influence their trips. At some point, halfway through the trip, I felt I wouldn't be able to get that euphoric feeling I was longing if I didn't do something about it. I went to the bathroom and lay on the floor for 15 minutes having an extremely bad trip feeling nauseous going all the way through. At the end of those 15 minutes I finally understood everything: why I was feeling this grudge towards my second girlfriend (I had lost the only way I knew how to manage my symptoms, which was never her task of course to do that for me), why I felt unfulfilled, why I was still feeling the after effects of what I thought was a near burnout 5 years later. I came out barely holding back tears. When I came out, the girlfriend of one of the people I was having a trip with was having a bad trip herself and they went to check on her, while I could calm down a little watching a Studio Ghibli movie. I told them I'd had an epiphany and needed to call my parents as soon as it was cold enough to go outside. I did, told them (and this still hurts me remembering what I said) that I was doing bad, and what had been going on for the past five years. I went to my GP, got a reference for the psychologist, told the first friends I saw, told my boss, told my teachers, and went on with my life. I've had to wait for 2 years to get into counselling. The first year I was still teaching, figuring out what had happened. The shrooms not only made me realize I needed help, but they also changed my emotional responses. I would cry more easily rather than withdraw, but also my triggers changed. The main trigger is now no longer suicide, but it's memories of the way I felt during that relationship and all the emotional responses I've had since including during the trip. And it's the suffering of others, I feel what I can imagine they are feeling. Reading about Palestine has been especially bad for me, with all those thousands of people being traumatized as well. Suicide still is a trigger, but way less so. Last year I started a second masters and I got other symptoms. All new people and I didn't want to start out by telling people about my PTSD. It was difficult for me to talk, because all I could think about were my symptoms and I felt like I couldn't mention those. I felt a distance from others, having a hard time feeling any sort of connection to anyone, having a hard time making friends, noticing how my coping mechanisms could be seen as weird or off-putting, feeling thoroughly lonely at times. At the same time, I've been slowly getting my memory back of the years, both its functioning and the memories, which took effort to get used to again. Same for my emotions. It was about a year ago that I felt angry again for the first time in like 6 or 7 years, which is hard because I'd forgotten how to cope with that properly, it's scary too. I started journaling daily just over a year ago. It helped so much that I was afraid to stop. It's only recently that I've dared to journal less than daily. Just before the summer I also finally got my diagnosis and started therapy.\n\nToday I read some sources. My therapist had already mentioned and talked about how my first ex likely had borderline, and I read about that. It's all a lot and progress is so incredibly slow that I'm very careful about saying things are going better so I won't feel disappointed in my own judgment whenever I'm doing badly again. I'm slowly telling more and more people in my life about what I'm dealing with. This is another practice run for me talking about what happened I guess, talking about my struggles. It's still hard, writing is easier yet less effective than talking, but so many things happened and it's not some key things that happened that got me to where I am now, it was a build up of so many little things continuously that eventually got me to the point where I was 24/7 terrified she was going to kill herself which did it. So many little things to process. I guess I can say it's better now: I feel happy more than the at most once per two months I did 2 years ago, I feel like I'm regaining access to emotions I haven't felt for years (which is difficult to get used to), and I feel like I am finally able to maintain friendships again.   \nI hope it does still become easier, because it's still frequently quite hard. It should become easier, I know it will, but it's also hard to see how that'd be, having mourned the person I was and slowly losing the detailed memories of how things were. I hope to no longer have to look for visions of the past or do thought experiments for a future to know what an actual good life feels like, but rather experience it again. Only time will tell I guess, but until then I will remain positively hopeful. I still got my oracle, the one that in the end told me to trust myself, get myself admitted regardless of all the doubts, 2.5 years left on that, and then I hope to no longer need superficial things like an oracle to hold on to but rather constantly feel the presence of a strong and safe social network again.",

I saw him about twice a year for short stints, living a state away and not having the flexibility to get away more. I will be honest though that there was ambivalence about seeing him. \n\nHe had gotten a lot more frail over the last five years. I always thought of him positively as a vibrant, funny man who had many interesting friends and stories in life, intellectual interests. But when I saw him these past years that wasn‚Äôt the man I saw. He didn‚Äôt have much to say to me nor me to him. I felt guilty that I wasn‚Äôt a big success in life, and while I admired him for his interests in music, literature, collecting art by famous authors etc, I didn‚Äôt share his interests or become knowledgeable about them. My interests by comparison were more limited and pedestrian. He was a much admired doctor. I was a wannabe scientist dog trainer.\n\nWhen it was time to go home he would be so sad, wishing I didn‚Äôt have to leave, even though our time together was so‚Ä¶awkward and disengaged. I loved being part of the family scene when everyone was together but one on one we were awkward, not much to say.\n\nI knew I needed to see him more because I sensed he wouldn‚Äôt be around much longer. I was supposed to get down for Thanksgiving but he died election day. I spoke to him on the phone while he lay unconscious, and then he died.\n\nI‚Äôm feeling a lot of guilt because while I have had waves of grief, I have otherwise accepted it and often forget he is gone. Not having been present at his passing the way my older sibs were doesn‚Äôt help because somehow it doesn‚Äôt feel real.\n\nYou may wonder why I‚Äôm writing this here. Because I‚Äôm having a resurgence of feeling that I was SA‚Äôd as a young child but have no explicit memories. All I do know is that I‚Äôve had a life of mental anguish stemming from a lot of things but‚Ä¶\n\n1. As a young girl of about 7 I was the instigator of sexual play with two other girls involving anal. Where the hell does that come from?\n\n2. I hid my pubescent body wearing hoodies throughout junior high as I developed, trying to hide and not be seen sexually. Meanwhile my best friends were the opposite, welcoming such attention from boys. I was a wallflower with few friends, social anxiety, and a desire to be invisible. I became bulimic at 16.\n\n3. I was the opposite of promiscuous in high school, running away/repelling the few guys that got a chance to try when things got too heavy.\n\n4. When I did lose my virginity to a man 9 years older than me at 18, I found giving head abhorrent. I never entertained anal sex until my husband but that was a no go because it was extremely painful due to my hemorrhoids‚Ä¶which I had despite never having kids‚Ä¶.\n\n5. Extreme intimacy issues. I go elsewhere during sex, can‚Äôt be in the moment, want to get it over with. A wall goes up.\n\nLots more but I am of the belief that I was abused and blocked it out so I don‚Äôt know who the perp was but in hindsight have had this weird ambivalent relationship with my dad, and his loss is bringing this all up.\n\nI do feel like my life and way of going bear the hallmarks of PTSD with the avoidance, numbing out, very poor memory of my past, bulimia for 30 years, repulsion about sex, failure to thrive in life, extreme discomfort with male authority figures‚Ä¶I just don‚Äôt have explicit memories. My life has been plagued by anxiety and depression.\n\nI had a conversation with my sister about this after dad died.  I wondered if it could be our babysitter- she basically committed statutory rape with my brother who is 7 years older than me, though some would just say she was his first. She said the babysitter also had a strange boyfriend, no memory of him. \n\nMy sister is 6 years older and admitted to sexual play as a child with friends where she was the instigator. People talk about sexual exploration in children as normal but is it really?? She does know that she was messed with by one of the neighbor boys on a sleepover in a tent in their yard, one of them rubbing on her. Why she was there at all was strange on the face of it. They were friends with my brother. \n\nMy sister went in the direction of overly promiscuous.  We both snuck peaks at Dad‚Äôs Playboy magazines under the bed.\n\nWhen I was really little I would wander over to the neighbors to play with the boy closest to my age, but there were 6 boys in that family and I have none of the others in my memory bank and only two faint memories of being over there. I do remember coming home crying but don‚Äôt know why. \n\nAny other SA victims here who didn‚Äôt have memories but eventually did? Does any of this seem familiar?",

I am NOT going to be giving my number clearly as the dynamic here is clear and its unprofessional. \n\nI have explained all of this to my manager and she recomended report this to the practice educators who look after all students. Yesterday morning they responded that they would speak to him quietly on his next placement. It was agreed by my manager that i wouldn't work with him yesterday because i was uncomfortable with it as my anxiety/PTSD was triggered due to previous adult SA about 4 years ago after being asked for drinks...\n\nYesterday however, in the morning when seeing him he was asking about his documents and i said i would see if i had the time because the unit is horrifically busy right now with critically unwell patients and my patients and safety of the unit comes before any student documents as they have time to be filled out after placement if needed. So he turns round and say 'and this is why your no good- when we've worked together a few times directly but i recieve feedback from my team to assess him' this triggers my deep seated fear of never being good enough which lead to me being upset in the office which i also explain to my manager. She is even more not happy at this point considering the day before's behaviour. \n\nLater on in the day he came to the office to find me to tell me something. My manager was in the office at the time and after he had left the office she was not at all comfortable with how close he was to me and how he kind leant over me which she saw herself.\n\nTo which today she has asked for an urgent meeting with the practice educator team today while i'm not there to discuss his inappropiate behaviour towards me. \n\nNow here is where i feel bad, this could affect him going forward and continuing his degree. However, i have a responsibility to future people he works with/looks after to report this behaviour.\n\nThen i went into a bit of a spiral like what if he pesters me via email/comes to the unit to find me etc etc and then i feel like i caused all this that this is my issues based of previous experience and just reading too much into this. \n\nBut i've had at least 1 year of consistent trauma therapy now and realised that i should have to feel this anxious/scared just from doing my job and having a responsability to others going forward. \n\nHe also turned up the next day looking for me and trying to get his documents signed but asked specfically for me and where i was. \n\nSo why do we blame ourselves for these things, like is it drumed into us. I mean i know logically yes is the answer but does anyone else have any ideas?\n\nI think i'm scared and feel like i blew it all out of proportion. ",

    "selftext": "Hi! I recently got diagnosed with PTSD. I do not talk about it, except with my psychiatrist and my therapist, so I need a little bit of help/advice there. \n(only few trustworthy members of family, and friend that definitely never experienced a amount of traumas that could make them empathize/understand what kind of state of mind I'm in) \nBefore starting, English is not my mother tongue, so I could make some grammatical mistakes, and I apologize for that. \nLong story short, I've got diagnosed 2 months ago with a PTSD that my psychiatrist think is there since 2 years. \nThere's few symptoms that I find weird, and I wanted to know if I'm not the only one who experience those. \n\nSometimes I got random \"outburst\" of fatigue and/or anxiety, but like, big ones. If I can fonction, what a cost, most of the time I need to wait for them to go away and rest. Sometimes it goes on for hours. \nI just feel like my body is numb when it's fatigue, and my mind is numb when it's anxiety.\nI do work, which exhausts me twice as much as my coworkers, even when I'm not in an \"outburst\" episode. \n\nAlso, I fortunately didn't experience SA or anything like that, but in most of intimacy moments I just cry ? I'm not sad or anything, there's juste tears coming up for few minutes, and need to stop anything. After that, I can \"restart\", but damn it's weird as fuck, especially because I didn't experience r*pe, SA and my partner is a good guy, and everything seems fine. It does not happen every time. \n\nAnd last but not least, combat reflex. Anytime someone gets near me, touchs me, or grabs me and I didn't see them coming, I protect myself or I clench my fists and throw a punch. It happens before I can even think about it, in few fractions of seconds. It's quite a fight of flight reflex. Luckily, every time I just stop before hitting someone, when I realized that person is not a threat, but I almost injuried some friends or strangers. I feel fucking guilty about that one, I don't what to do... My PTSD is not about a physical assault or anything like that so I don't know why I have such reflex... \n\n\n\nI'm currently doing everything to stabilize those symptoms and treat my PTSD, if you have some pieces of advice, especially for the last one, it would help me. \nI'm doing everything to have a normal life and to fonction in society. \n\nThanks for reading that, I hope you'll have a great day ü´Ç",

    "selftext": "So my roommate (we‚Äôll call him ‚Äúr‚Äù) had left home as his father was getting into stuff he didn‚Äôt wanna be involved in..\nBesides that..\n R had a past with me and not a pretty one he had a past of calling the cops on me when he was in a bad mood even going as far as telling others we were doing stuff whilst I was in a relationship, he had put me through bad trauma and left me with emotions scars . He was obsessed with me sending me paragraphs love messages then threatening to jump my s/o, he even got physical with me and would pull me aggressively by my hair I was overly naive thinking he just had it hard .. one night we went drinking and he took it to far even going to lengths of taking a video and spreading that around , it didn‚Äôt go well in his favour as people I didn‚Äôt know would chase him but that‚Äôs give him more reasons to call the cops, but I put that all behind me as I just wanted to move on and forget, it had been a full year after all this . I had been through worse and just witnessed my friend loose herself on the streets hearing he was leaving with no where to go right after this broke me worse with anxious thoughts so I offered him to stay a night or two which turned into months, without my knowledge I came to find he would constantly try to get in my s/o‚Äôs head which would make him and I fight leaving me wondering what set him off , again and again the fights got worse leaving me wrecked . Then one day I went out for a break with some friends they were left alone and got into a pity fight which escalated to both of them calling me trying to tattle on each other like children, I got back asap to find r leaving and packed things everywhere claiming his uncle was coming to pick him up, his uncle went on saying he wanted to hurt and get physical with my s/o so I had them go upstairs.. sitting down their for the last few minutes he continued to make a joke referencing to the past and Trauma r had put me through still not admitting he did anything wrong , I felt humiliated once again even shaky and said ‚Äúwhy even say that.? What was the point ‚Äú he then responded snarking with a laugh ‚ÄúI mean somebody had to say it ‚Äú I then said I was going upstairs few moments later . To explain what and how the things he put me through effected me , I woke up to see this video everywhere sick to my stomach I called s/o sobbing he had to comfort me as yes it was proof what I did was wrong others would talk and I just didn‚Äôt wanna hear it , having multiple people come up to me for the week , being cornered in the bathroom, having those I knew spoke about me laugh and not try to hide their enjoyment, only to be eventually stuck in my bed crying to the point my face was stained red from tears with a bucket next to my bed , I couldn‚Äôt even shower I had given up, then the police calls came in ‚Ä¶ everyday I‚Äôd have a cop at the door or phone , same conversation everytime ‚Äúdo you know j?‚Äù Me:‚Äùyes I know what this is about I don‚Äôt know who‚Äôs saying what to him this has been going on for a month now I just wanna be left alone .‚Äù Then having to re explain how it all started reliving this nightmare everyday and night just waiting to wake up from it all, the cops went as far as calling j an idiot but not taking action on the harassment, im still young and this has left it‚Äôs tole on me deeply no one will understand how hard it truely is to wake up to the same abuse everyday and scars that border deeper .. eventually the calls stopped and I tried going out but during this time I wasn‚Äôt taking good care of myself and I‚Äôll admit I looked horribly so getting called names with everything else was my breaking point I just stopped talking to people and stayed to myself which helped with going out focusing on my relationships with those I cared about . then j once again when I thought I could take a breath  had to suffocate me , I woke up to a text of threats claiming he was going to take me to court for harassment from others blaiming me for the problems he brought upon himself . This time I lost it I screamed everything at him breaking down on how he‚Äôs ruined my life and how all I asked was to be left alone , I won‚Äôt get into much details but he replied with a block with his friends texting me and my s/o photos of men in masks taking that to the cops felt easy but did they take action yet? No. clearly it‚Äôs just ‚Äúyoung dumb drama‚Äù right? After all this I still tried to help him get better change . A year later . Hopefully this helps see the whole picture but I haven‚Äôt shared this story with anyone on how this effected me or what really happen . ",

They yell at me if my fiance does nice things for me and say he babys me too much and that I need to do it myself. Mind you I have been having health problems for that past couple months that cause me to faint and pass out which I had this problem constantly as a child as well. They know that but when I was little they would just tell me to just get over it or get past it. Today and yesterday I got yelled at first by my dad for being baby too much by my fiance or being taken care of. Being told that it's my fault he lost his job. He lost his job because he was sick for months and also has poor health problems like I do. He finally has a job and been able to go back to work. But because me and my fiance has boundary that he can't  be over night or super late home due to his health problems and mine they got mad at me for that. I brought up a concern to my mother since he been working with her that I least just don't want him to be getting off super late. I talked to my mother about it and she flipped on me saying that my concern or worried would just make him quit and not to bring it up. Mind you they work around other employees schedules constantly and accommodate for them whenever they need. I let it go though but everytime my fiance is gone at work or goes anywhere my parents constantly degrade me and tell me all things that I'm doing wrong in their eyes. They constantly tell me that if I mess up this relationship it's my fault and they constantly remind me of the incident that made my ptsd get diagnose in the first how that I was stupid I should of done this different or done better. I should of listen to them gotten out when they told me too. That incident I was constantly stuck in a place I didn't really have a choice or way out without putting myself in danger if they tried to help they made it 10 times worse and ended up getting me into more danger. But they have done that with every relationship  I've been in. The first relationship I was in the guy SA me and they kept pushing me to get back together with him because he was their friends son. They would constantly critize me because I was terrifying of working because of how my health was and still is. I was barely ever even at school too because of my health. They would constantly say how amazing he was and he did everything so much better. No matter who I was with romantically or even friends with they constantly told me how I should be more like them. How I should be better? Being here has made my ptsd on the rockers every night I am having constant ptsd night terrors and constant flash backs. I'm constantly walking on egg shells terrified constantly. I'm constantly falling apart half the time I just disappear and get lost into flash back barely even able to pull myself back out of it.

My whole life has been traumatic because I was adopted at 3 months and at 6 months old I got diagnosed with cerebral palsy. From 2 to about 10 I had surgeries. For a little background. My mental health started getting bad senior year of high school. I would cry every day, have episode every day. When i got into the 18-21 program the same thing happened except this time I was dissociating. These episodes were traumatic for me. I had episodes this year and they were traumatic. I am afraid and guilty about having an episode again when I go back to school. The teachers are so good to me and that makes feel guilty. My special education teacher from high came to work in the program I have a strong relationship with her. I told her that January is a hard month for me so she is prepared, because I have done so well so far. like I said these episodes are really traumatic for me. I am having flashbacks of my last day of school before my surgery and having the same flashbacks that i having for almost 2 years which is me going into surgery. \nI am in therapy. Has something like this happened to you i feel so alone. \nThanks. ",

    "selftext": "I was recently diagnosed with PTSD, and it makes sense. For the most part, I am very people-pleasing and try to avoid conflict at all costs. I work in law because I love how it turns conflict into something almost like a mathematical equation, logically breaking down motives into elements that can be negotiated so everyone is satisfied.\n\nWhen I am triggered, which usually involves situations related to my kids, my husband and I end up fighting a lot about it. In those moments, I literally feel like I can‚Äôt stay calm, like fight-or-flight takes over my body, and I choose fight every time. I say hurtful things, lose sight of the situation being just a simple discussion, and revert to survival instincts.\n\nI fully acknowledge that my responses to triggers are my responsibility and that I am accountable for my actions. However, in the heat of the moment, those thoughts fly out the window, and the gloves come off. I end up regretting what I said later and promise myself that I‚Äôll handle it differently next time.\n\nI want to break this cycle. I want to be more in control. But no matter how much I try to practice self-discipline, those fight-or-flight hormones are real, powerful, and present. I don‚Äôt think anyone on the outside truly sees how much I‚Äôm struggling or how hard I‚Äôm trying.

    "title": "Neurological problems and medical trauma ",
    "selftext": "Hi, though it might help me a bit posting here..\n\nAbout a year ago, i started noticing some changes in myself and getting a couple neurological symptoms. At first, my symptoms were pretty subtle. I had some coordination problems, my limbs felt heavy, and I struggled a bit with brain fog. But then things got worse‚ÄîI started having spasms, stiffness, and trouble with memory and thinking. It felt like my body wasn‚Äôt moving the way it used to, like my movements were out of sync with my brain. Even though I could still move, everything felt slower and harder to control.\n\nOver time, I found myself losing the ability to keep up with life. I had to drop out of school, quit my job, and even gave up my jewelry-making hobby because my hands just wouldn‚Äôt cooperate. I saw a few neurologists last summer, but since my brain and neck MRIs came back normal, I got diagnosed with Functional Neurological Disorder (FND). It was frustrating because I felt like no one was listening to me. My symptoms were getting worse, and I knew something wasn‚Äôt right, but they didn‚Äôt bother doing any further tests.\n\nNow, everything feels like it‚Äôs falling apart. My symptoms aren‚Äôt just progressing slowly anymore‚Äîthey‚Äôre getting worse by the week or even by the day. I‚Äôve lost almost all control over my body. It‚Äôs like my brain and body aren‚Äôt communicating anymore. I can‚Äôt feel my posture, stretch my arms or legs properly, or even notice when I need to swallow. I‚Äôve stopped feeling basic signals from my body, and even my reflexes don‚Äôt seem to work like they used to.\n\nOn top of the physical stuff, I‚Äôm dealing with major cognitive and emotional changes. My memory is terrible, I‚Äôm forgetting who I am and what matters to me, and I feel less and less aware of my surroundings. I even feel like I‚Äôve lost some of my self-awareness‚Äîit‚Äôs like my connection to ‚Äúme‚Äù is fading. I get moments where I can‚Äôt stay logical or regulate my emotions. I also think I might have something called cortical blindness because my brain can‚Äôt seem to process anything visually anymore. These days, I pretty much have to stay completely immobile to get some kind of relief.\n\nEmotionally, this has been devastating. I don‚Äôt feel like myself, and I‚Äôm constantly grieving the life and person I used to have. I was once creative, driven, and social, with so many plans for my future. Now, even getting through basic tasks feels impossible. I‚Äôve noticed I‚Äôve lost some facial expressions, and that makes me feel even more insecure. I fear I‚Äôm going to lose my ability to speak, think clearly, and express myself entirely.\n\nMy breaking point was an ER visit about a month ago. I went there because my movement issues had gotten so bad, but instead of taking me seriously, they called in a psychiatrist and labeled me ‚Äúcatatonic.‚Äù I ended up having a full breakdown because they dismissed everything as psychological and didn‚Äôt do any further testing. The whole experience was humiliating and made me terrified to go to a hospital again.\n\nNow, I feel completely stuck. Even when I try to share my concerns with my family, they don‚Äôt understand. My dad told me I belong in a mental hospital, and people around me seem to think I‚Äôm immature or lazy because I can‚Äôt explain myself like I used to. The hardest part is that I feel like I‚Äôm fading away, like I‚Äôm losing every part of myself that made me unique.\n\nI hate to admit it, but sometimes I wish I‚Äôd just peacefully pass away because it feels like things will only get worse. All I really want is for someone to show me compassion and understand what I‚Äôm going through instead of judging me. I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can hold on if no one listens. I feel like because of these health issues, something bad might happen to me quite soon.   \n",

    "selftext": "For context, I have bipolar II, and my mood has been low the last number of months but I haven't had many other symptoms.  Primarily, I found that I would ruminate on my children growing up and moving out, and being sad about being left behind.  It felt somewhat like depression because I couldn't pull myself out of the feeling that I couldn't make a good life for myself without them.  I know that's not true, but it was hard to see.\n\nTwo weeks ago, I had a sharp turn of mood.  I start to have ruminations about death and dying, the seeming pointlessness of life.  It can become overwhelming and it kicks my anxiety up so high because, obviously, these are unpleasant thoughts.  It is like I'm gripped with something and my brain is hijacked.  I can try to breathe, meditate, distract but when it's bad I can only get relief for that time.  As soon as my brain has to move to mundane tasks, the dread comes back.  I spend most of my day with a podcast on in the background to try to drown it out.  I've had this happen before, but worse - I wasn't on any meds for my mood and it resolved once I got on the right meds.\n\n  \nI thought this was a bipolar episode but now I'm not sure.  The first and previously only episode was about a month after I witnessed my first death (I was a nurses aide at the time).  This one was a few weeks after my daughter passed out after getting her blood drawn.  I'm wondering if that's what triggered this because she went grey and went out right in front of me.  I knew what to do and what caused it but it's still terrifying to see your beautiful, perfect daughter go grey and limp.\n\n  \nAnyway, I did get a med change for the bipolar.  But I'm wondering if anyone else with PTSD has had similar episodes of negative mood, high anxiety, ruminations, particularly about death.  Sometimes not feeling alone with this really makes a difference, so I'm reaching out for more help than I ever had before.  If you've made it this far - thanks!",

He constantly looked at cuckhold porn and wanted me to talk to him about it while we were having sex. Over several years, the last few of our marriage, he talked me into having sex with at least three other men at the same time. He talked me into having an open relationship with men that I was to have sex with, then come home and tell him about it, while we were having sex.\n\nUnfortunately, for him, my going out in the world to date other men showed me that a lot of other men are so much nicer and more respectful  than he is. \n\nI ended up marrying the last man who I dated while I was married to him. He wasn‚Äôt really comfortable with my husband being part of it, even remotely, but we liked each other so much from the start that he was willing to go with the flow and experiment. To be fair, I have no problem with people who enjoy having an open marriage. I just never wanted to do it myself, and did it to please my ex. I already had a history of being sexually abused, and had not addressed my anxiety and depression. I just wanted to be loved and taken care of.\n\nMy current husband talked and talked and talked to me, and supported me in getting back into therapy and starting medication for my mental health. He supported me in learning to find my voice and to love and respect myself. I was such a submissive doormat that much of this was uncomfortable for me. We were eating in a restaurant and he asked me if I wanted another beer before he got the check. I answered by asking him if he wanted another beer. He looked at me steadily, with kindness, and said I asked you first. And encouraged me to tell him what I wanted so that he could do it. This was a revelation to me. \n\nAlong with all this sexual abuse, my ex was financially and verbally abusive. And really mean to our kids; he ended up shoving our older son against the wall a few times.\n\nThank you for listening. I just needed to put it down here to get it out of my head. I am so proud of her poor declining to be anonymous and I can only hope that the world takes notice and works harder to take care of people who have been sexually assaulted.",

    "selftext": "Let‚Äôs cut the bullshit and face reality: Children who grow up abused‚Äîphysically, emotionally, or both‚Äîend up carrying that trauma into adulthood. When a mother abuses her child, no matter what her past is, we need to stop dancing around ‚Äúwho‚Äôs to blame‚Äù and call it what it is: it‚Äôs her fault. Period.\n\nSome people try to deflect this. They say, ‚ÄúOh, the father‚Äôs 50% responsible, even if he‚Äôs never around.‚Äù That‚Äôs absolute nonsense. When you bring a child into this world, both parents are each 100% responsible, independently. If one parent dies, disappears, or just doesn‚Äôt give a damn, the other parent doesn‚Äôt get to shrug and say, ‚ÄúWell, I only owe you half-assed care now.‚Äù You don‚Äôt just do your 50% and say ‚Äúfuck the rest.‚Äù You step up, you do everything in your power to protect and nurture that child. If you‚Äôre beating your kid, you‚Äôve already failed, and no deadbeat dad excuses that.\n\nThen there are those who say, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not the mother‚Äôs fault because she was abused, too.‚Äù Really? By that logic, let‚Äôs let all criminals off the hook. They‚Äôve probably been through trauma, right? Should rapists and murderers get a free pass because they had a rough childhood? Hell no. A mother who unleashes her trauma on her child is not magically absolved. She‚Äôs responsible for her actions, and if she‚Äôs abusing her kid, she‚Äôs in the wrong.\n\nAnd the absolute worst take? Blaming the child. ‚ÄúThey misbehaved. They made her angry.‚Äù Every kid misbehaves. That‚Äôs what kids do. A parent‚Äôs job is to guide, teach, and love‚Äînot to lash out with fists or words. If someone pisses you off in the street, do you get to beat them bloody because they ‚Äúmade you angry‚Äù? Didn‚Äôt think so. Being a parent demands self-control and responsibility, not victimizing your own flesh and blood.\n\nIn the end, the truth is simple: If a mother abuses her child, it‚Äôs entirely on her. Full stop. When she chose to have that child, she took on 100% responsibility to care for them, no matter what the father does or doesn‚Äôt do, and no matter what her own past looks like. There‚Äôs no escape hatch for accountability. It‚Äôs her fault. Don‚Äôt let anyone tell you otherwise.",

    "selftext": "CW: brief mention of residential fire (regarding loss of belongings, bullying (verbal))\n\nI realized a few days ago that gift-giving can be a trauma response. (In addition to some advice/insight I was looking for some peer reviewed articles or if anyone knows of a psychology book that talks about this behavior in particular?)\n\nI was wrapping gifts for members of the group therapy I attend biweekly, gifts that I put a lot of thought into. We didn‚Äôt do a secret santa or anything, I just wanted to make them smile. Gift giving has always made me happy.\n\nThis made me think of something I used to do when I was a child- any money I would receive, I would spend it on things for other people- my friends usually.\n\nThe fire happened in the middle of the 5th grade. It was 2 AM on a school night. It was in my room. I lost literally everything that I owned except the nightie I had on.\n\nIt was also around this time that kids started to be mean‚Ä¶ 5th grade into 6th grade. They started to decide who was popular and cool and who wasn‚Äôt. Signs had started to point in the wrong direction for me... even before the fire happened.\n\nOne day I was called to the principal‚Äôs office over the loudspeaker.. which had my stomach in knots because I was a goody two shoes‚Ä¶ they said I had a paper to pick up. Once I got back to my class, my teacher greeted me in front of the door to the classroom- I looked past her and none of the students were there and all of the lights were off. She led me to the door of a connected classroom- the biggest classroom in the entire school. \n\nWhen I walked in I was absolutely mortified. All eyes were on me. My entire class sat around in a huge circle (like literally everyone my age in my town) and every teacher (and I don‚Äôt even know who else!!) and handed me gifts one by one, and I opened all of them right then and there. I think after the first couple I started to dissociate. The biggest reason I can think of is that I could see the pity on their faces. I remember some of the kids looked bored to death. Maybe they were annoyed that I was getting special attention. Idk.\n\nBut I felt like an imposter‚Ä¶ internalizing what happened earlier in the week‚Ä¶I had been getting bullied on the bus a few days before this happened. Two neighborhood boys said it was my fault and I did it on purpose. Deep down I knew that it was an accident, I mean the fire chief looked at me and told me it was. But those kids made me believe that it was my fault. \n\nMy parents never got me therapy. Whenever I ask them about the past, that time in our lives, they usually say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù and sound annoyed that I expected them to be present during my childhood and actually remember things.\n\nUp until this day I don‚Äôt know who organized this‚Ä¶ if a neighbor called the school, a teacher heard about what happened to me, or if one of the students suggested it‚Ä¶ I obviously appreciated what they did for me, but it made me so embarrassed and overwhelmed me. I felt like I wasn‚Äôt reacting how they were expecting me to‚Ä¶ maybe I didn‚Äôt look ‚Äúgrateful enough‚Äù? I definitely worried about it for days after the fact.\n\nThis all makes sense when you read about gift RECEIVING causing trauma‚Ä¶ but when I genuinely enjoy GIVING gifts, and I have done this since I was a young child‚Ä¶ which suggests the opposite problem‚Ä¶ when you give excessive gifts as a child (or as an adult) you can do it because you were neglected or abused and feel the need to give gifts for attention and to be loved. \n\nI‚Äôm confused about how it can be both. I had that ONE mortifying experience of receiving gifts‚Ä¶ but the fact that I‚Äôd spend my allowance on other people before that happened? Does anyone have any theories or insight on how I can analyze my past to move forward? \n\n(I have a great therapist who I see weekly - and I can‚Äôt wait to tell him about this breakthrough!!!!!)",

My nightmares have also started to get really bad again, like people dying or getting sexually assaulted. They weren't this bad until I started dating again.

Been divorced 4 years now, and recently I've been dating a wonderful man for a couple of months. No red flags, just the best gutfeeling, he's done everything to make me feel seen, heard, secure and loved. We felt like we were a match made in heaven....\n\nUntill I got triggered, out of the blue. And it was such a stupid thing (as it usually is) - he just took his time to respond to my message one day, and there we go - I felt ignored, something popped up made me think about silent treatment - and you name it, I was dysregulated and acted in that state. \n\nWhat did I do? Sent him a message, saying \"you're probably not interested any more, I find it kind of weird not responding to my message earlier (totally forgot he was on an airplane) and I guess you just can't bare with me in the long run, so I think we just end it here\"...\n\nHow stupid, childish, so immature - all because my fear overwhelmed me - AND also because I really really love this man, and it scares me so much, it's easier to run now, 'cause eventually he'd probably let me down anyways. Now, I think I might have \"tested\" if he was able to deal with all of me, unconciously, and when it turned out he got scared, sad and pulled away, all my fears were \"confirmed\". \n\nI can't blame him. Out of the blue I \"assumed\" things about him. Everything has just been so lovely untill now. I blew it, sabotaged it. He got scared, sent me a message saying \"this was too much, you scare me and I agree to ending this. I wish you the best and hopefully you'll find love elsewhere\". I was crushed. Devastated. Tried to call, write him an apology and explanation, but he just blocked me. \n\nNow, The thing is, I never told him about my past. Never told him I have ptsd and this might happen. I thought it was premature to tell him. But in stead he sees a side of me that scares him so much he just locks the door. \n\nHe was the one, and I pushed him away. I am blocked, and I find it kind of immature to do that, but I know I hurt him too much, so I can't blame him. But I'm in deep pain and would so much like to explain myself to him. \n\nWhat can I do? He might have acted in affect too, but his words were so \"final\". Is there a chance he might come back when he's processed it all and is calmed down? Should I write him a letter? How do I apologize and explain this behavior? What to say? I know why and what happened, I pushed him before he got the chance to abandon me. I was terrified because  I'm starting to love him....\n\nPlease, if any advice, I'd love to hear it. I hate myself for doing this, hurting him, hurting myself. He'll probably not want to listen or read something from me....and when should I send him this, if so? it's only been a week now.\n\nPlease don't tell me to just \"let go\" and move on, I will not just let go without trying to repair this...He means sp much to me and deserves to know....\n\nps. I am in therapy, twice a week. \n\nHeartbroken :(  ",

    "selftext": "I grew up with an extremely abusive mother who never accepted me as I was. No matter what I did, it felt like it was never enough. She kept me isolated from kids my own age, so I never really learned how to connect with others. Instead, I absorbed all the hurtful images she gave me of myself‚Äîimages that tore down my self-esteem and made me believe I was broken at my very core. Over time, this fear of being judged and exposed turned into a deep reluctance to show anyone my true self. I became convinced there was something wrong with me in every possible way.\n\nAs I got older, I started noticing that acceptance is often given with conditions, in almost every relationship. We try to shape how others see us, hoping to pass their ‚Äútests,‚Äù because deep down we all want to belong. We may even feel tempted to manipulate how people perceive us, just to feel safe and loved. But that only leads to a hollow sense of connection, since the acceptance we gain isn‚Äôt built on who we really are.\n\nOn the other hand, if we show up as ourselves‚Äîflaws, fears, and all‚Äîwe risk not being accepted at all. That‚Äôs a painful truth. And even though it seems like letting our true selves shine should attract those who genuinely care, it doesn‚Äôt work out so smoothly.\n\nSo we end up in a difficult situation. Trying to fit others‚Äô expectations doesn‚Äôt promise true acceptance, and showing our real selves often means most people won‚Äôt understand us. As we grow older, it feels even harder to find a place or a person who accepts us without strings attached.",

    "selftext": "I‚Äôm (17F) and since I was 8 I was constantly raped and abused my multiple different people. Someone even tried to drug and kidnap me before when I was 11. Then when I was 14 I started drinking and doing drugs because I was sick of repeatedly being hurt and it was the only thing that would make me forget about it. And I had tried other things like therapy,antidepressants,hospital but nothing helped and then it was like when I was drunk or high nothing mattered anymore. I didn‚Äôt care about what happened. \n\nBut then one day my drug dealer asked if I wanted to do some with him and he‚Äôd drive me home after because I had already a bit drank before getting there and he was scared I‚Äôd get hurt if I get high on top of that. And I trusted that and I usually did it alone and it was quite lonely. And I did so much that I passed out. And he raped me. And he took pictures and filmed it. Then he made me leave on my own. And I don‚Äôt fully remember how I got home but I did luckily. But then the next day he sent me the videos and photos saying if I don‚Äôt send him nudes he‚Äôll post them everywhere. So I complied for a while. But he started asking for them like almost hourly and would get really aggressive and threatening if I wouldn‚Äôt send them. \n\nEven if I was in school or something. He‚Äôd be like ‚ÄúYou think I care? Go to the bathroom or something unless you want everyone to know how much of a pathetic whore you are‚Äù. And eventually I had enough and I was like ‚ÄúFuck you. I know you‚Äôre bullshitting. If you post the videos it‚Äôll just incriminate you. I‚Äôll report you for being not only a dealer but a nonce too and if you post it you‚Äôll be incriminating yourself.‚Äù And he was like ‚ÄúYou did drugs that‚Äôs a crime too. You‚Äôd be shooting yourself in the foot if you went to the police dumb bitch send it you know what will happen.‚Äù And I just said ‚ÄúDie.‚Äù And blocked him. \n\nI was scared for days but nothing happened until I started getting messages on my social media account and on WhatsApp from creeps. They said they saw the video and pictures. Turns out he posed some of the rape pics and videos and some of the nudes I sent saying that the reason I sent the nudes was because I ‚Äòenjoyed being raped so much‚Äô. And there was a thing like if you sent him money he‚Äôd send all of the rest and give out my number and social media to them.\n\nSo people PAID like ¬£10 to see it. And was giving me death threats. Saying they‚Äôll come to my house and kill me and my family if I don‚Äôt meet up with them. And I got offers to have sex for money. Or to send more nudes for money. It was gross I had to block like 20 people and I wonder how many more paid to see the extra content but not to contact me. \n\nSo I told the police. And showed the evidence and they said it‚Äôs my fault for getting illegal drugs and drunk underage. And from the video and nudes it looks like I consented and me sending nudes technically makes me a sex offender because it counts as sharing child pornography even though it was my own. And maybe I‚Äôm just framing this guy. So they can‚Äôt do anything and I‚Äôm lucky that they decided to just give me a warning on my crimes. \n\nI already felt so guilty and I know I should‚Äôve but this made me have a breakdown. And I was still getting harassed. So I eventually decided if he can make money off of me and I‚Äôm already being humiliated anyway I should make money off myself because I needed the money and my image is already ruined. So I started to sell pictures of myself without my face and name attached tho. And then people really wanted to see my face and to meet me. And I would do meet ups for money. \n\nWhen I was 15 I stopped on and off because I would know what I was doing was making my mental health worse. And dangerous. But I needed the money. So I kept doing it again. I eventually stopped completely at 16. But the guilt still eats me up alive. I‚Äôm now an actor and like a low level instagram famous. I get recognised sometimes in public and I have a bit of a fan base which has been my dream since I was a child but now I‚Äôm scared. \n\nI use a stage name on my social media‚Äôs and acting gigs which is like a remix of my actual name. Because I‚Äôm scared it‚Äôll be easier to somehow find the rape videos and nudes. I‚Äôm so scared of being found out. And I‚Äôm so scared that one day they‚Äôll be exposed and my life will be over again and no one will ever hire me again. And everyone will hate me for doing drugs and being a slut.\n\nI can‚Äôt live with myself. I hate myself. And I know it‚Äôs my fault but knowing anyone could find this is eating me alive. I‚Äôve had 2 stalkers from my slight fame. What if one of them finds this? I just can‚Äôt do it anymore. I want to die. ",

    "selftext": "I (30F) have been in a very emotionally connected and serious relationship with my boyfriend (40M) and have thus far felt confidently equipped to help him navigate some severe PTSD related to multiple deaths and losses through his life, including the death of his 18 month-old daughter around 4 years ago. He‚Äôs not in a place to comfortable talk about much of his trauma and I have pieced together many details through friends and family. I helped him establish a psychiatrist and am working on connecting him with the option to see a trauma-informed therapist - particularly someone who can do psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy. \n\nFor context, I am a psychiatric nurse practitioner who works with children. I consider myself to be overly forgiving, people-pleasing, emotionally-validating, etc. I also have the professional background to understand complex trauma and its long-term effects on a person‚Äôs behavior. I have grown immensely in my ability to not take things personally when it comes to my partner‚Äôs triggers and reactions. I‚Äôve learned to anticipate difficult times and give space to my partner during and after conflicts, despite my nature to resolve and ‚Äúfix‚Äù things head-on. In truth, I have taken more than many would in terms of violence, name calling, dismissive/avoidance attachment, and gaslighting. I don‚Äôt feel like I can tell many people about the details and depth of the pain I go through in my relationship, especially my family.\n\nMy question is- what else can I do for him? I can‚Äôt help but feel deeply saddened and hurt by the pain in our relationship. I feel I am often absorbing his pain and doing what I can, as the ‚Äústronger‚Äù and less-traumatized person, to hold it and process it for him. There is little I wouldn‚Äôt do to support him. I think so highly of him and feel so much love for him that I want him in every way, every second‚Ä¶ even through the ugly and difficult. I‚Äôve gotten better at going to bed on the couch, writing my feelings down instead of saying them, and letting them go by the morning. But to be honest, I feel beat down after weeks of negative interaction after negative interaction. Cognitively I know that he loves me and wants me to be happy but his behaviors and words simply aren‚Äôt giving me any indication of that. I feel stupid and childish when I ask for reassurance from him.\n\nThere are times when he is an emotionally intelligent, considerate, passionate, loving, and gentle person. I see him as that person all of the time. I just want to know how else to give him what he needs so that he can be more and more of that beautiful person that I know. Is there something I‚Äôm missing? Are my expectations unreasonable? ",

Should I expect to discuss the specifics of what happened during early sessions or ever? Does a therapist need to know that sort of detail to offer help? I've not been diagnosed with PTSD, but is it legitimate to seek a trauma specialist? \n\nI know these questions might be kinda dumb. I don't really know how to get started and I'm really scared to.

It always hits me from outta the blue, when relaxing, having dinner and a movie, or enjoying a  beer or a drink after work. No matter what, I know when it hits, I know what's going to happen and I just steel myself against the coming storm. \nMy triggers are the smell of burnt wood, usually wet, certain songs from when I was a child, and sometimes the sight of yellow flames and the crackle of wood fires. In this case it was an old song. \nI do know once it's been set in motion that to fight it only makes it worse. I've said before that I can let my demon play but no longer let it rage, so I'll follow my own advice. So here I am, my demon is playing and I'll be affected for some days. I'm okay with that.

Last night was as expected, lots of images in my mind, lots of messed up thoughts and emotions, guilt and regret; huge lifelong mistakes, even stupid, simple ones, they all flared up. I admit that I let my demon berate and abuse me for too long. It's easy to wallow in self defeat.

There have been moments where I felt being in my body but it goes away after a while. How do I get rid of that fear and shame (specially shame) which I believe will allow me to come back to my body?\n\nSince I lost my job (as a result of the events that followed), I can't afford therapy and googling the cure for depersonalization derealization seems to be talk therapy. Any resources and/or people willing to talk/help will be really helpful to me at this time.",

    "title": "venting cause my entrance exam is in a few weeks",
    "selftext": ">!This is probably just a rant because I'm really stressed about my entrance exams. I'm 15F and I've been through kinda bad trauma ( in my opinion) ever since I was a child.  I'm not diagnosed because I don't really trust psychiatrists after my first consultation with one in a country where I'm not that fluent with the language (Japan). I was born and raised in the Philippines until I was 9 then my parents made me decide whether I wanted to live in Japan and as a child I obviously said yes because I wanted to experience a new life and explore more of the world. I have a pretty normal but kinda dysfunctional family. My sisters are way older than me, like 10+ years older so they moved out when I was pretty young. My parents fought a lot since I was a child, nothing intense or anything until I moved to Japan. I was bullied when I moved to Japan, but it wasn't that intense. My dad and mom started fighting a lot and a few months or a year after living here my dad pointed a knife at me when I tried to defend my mom from a fight so my mom and I hid in the bathroom, calling my teacher who then called the police. I had to stay at the police station for one night but the officers were really nice and caring. After that, I stayed at the house of my mom's friend until we returned to my city again, we were homeless for a day. The same thing happened again in the sixth grade when my parents fought again and we had to contact the police again it happened all over again but I stayed at my best friend's house for 2 weeks. Before we called the police my mom showed me a dildo which my dad raped her with and she told me everything so I instantly thought that I had to comfort her even though I barely knew how to process this. I was 12 so I didn't really know what to do. In the 7th grade, my dad threw insults at me every day mostly racial ones like \"Go back to the Philippines you don't belong here.\" and other stuff that I don't really remember. I was struggling a lot and I didn't have anyone to comfort me + I didn't know how to express my feelings so I tried to just stuff my feelings in and acted normally in school, then my best friend who helped me when we called the police started distancing herself from me, talking shit about me behind my back and asking stuff why I was so bad in Japanese. Because of that most of the girls in the volleyball club (which we were in) started distancing themselves from me, I begged and asked them what was wrong and what I did but they just ignored me or pushed me around during practice, still talking shit behind my back. It really hurt because she was one of my only friends here who I trusted and she treated me like shit so I have really bad trust issues now. When I went to my last volleyball competition I had a lot of fun till it was time to go home because as I entered the car my dad started ranting about how much of a disgrace and mistake I was and told me to kill myself. I never really cared because he told me to kill myself a lot of times before but it really hurt that time. In the 8th grade, there was a teacher who yelled a lot like my dad so I tried to avoid classes with that teacher by skipping them. I didn't go to school for 6 months because of that which may seem really silly. I went to church and made a really good friend but her mother talked lowly of me so much and I was shocked that she didn't even notice what she was saying. Then I started to go to a psychiatrist because it really affected me and he didn't even diagnose me he just started to ask stuff and yelled at me and forced me aggressively to spit out things when I wasn't even capable of speaking them out because I was crying but he still forced my to say it. In the end, he just gave me pills and told me to drink them. My mom also said stuff like how I didn't have a purpose in life which made me stop trying at all. I highly just wanted to be comforted, not have my feelings dismissed. My dad started to become more physical and started hurting my mom which made me try to commit suicide because I felt alone in this life and I know that trying to kill myself was selfish and I regret it. This year is my last year in junior high school and I've made a lot of good friends my life was okay until the end of August because the good friend I made in the church told everything I told her to my mom like really private stuff and our parents started to make fun of me in their DMS. I saw it because my mom had her Facebook account logged  on my laptop. I tried to kill myself 2 months later by hanging myself until my friend realized what was happening and stopped me. A week later he killed himself by suicide. I feel like an idiot because this person was a really dear friend of mine and my selfish ass just chose to vent a lot of times. I asked him occasionally if he was fine or doing okay before that and he always said yes. His death had me in denial and drowned me in guilt for weeks. Recently there was a teacher who made me really uncomfortable by being super close to me and then he started cornering me against a wall which made me feel really uncomfortable but I didn't do anything about it because it's my last year in this school. It's a silly thing to rant about but I just feel safe ranting it here. A few weeks ago I hung out with my friends during a Saturday to get rest because school work was really stressful so we went out to the mall. I called my mom telling her that I was home and she was having a fight with my dad. She told me that my dad had a glass and threw it at her which cut his hand. She told me to stay at the mall which I did, it was cowardly and I still regret that. After a while she called me again, telling me that my dad had spilt his blood everywhere, I didn't think much of it so I went home. When I arrived home I saw my dad's blood all over the carpet, walls and stuff around our house it was like a huge murder scene. He's alive but the next day he told my mom to show him his wound which had his bone showing but I obviously didn't look because I was traumatized enough. I still have flashbacks of that moment at random times. Now a few weeks later my entrance exams are near and I just have this sense of hopelessness and impending doom cause I feel like something bad will happen or I'll just fail the exams because my average grade in Japanese is really bad and the competition is really competitive. There was a time when I also had to comfort my mom for 4 hours after she had a recurring traumatic episode where she was repeating the same words and crying. I feel like a horrible and terrible person because recently I've been a really shitty person for a few weeks now. I just started dismissing others and I've been slamming doors shut and showing my anger often which made my mom tell me that I was just like my father. I genuinely don't know what to do anymore because there are just so many bad things happening and I haven't got any rest. When I told my dad I tried to commit he told me to do it somewhere else and my mom just made it about herself. !<",

I completely agree that what happened to her was unacceptable, and she deserved understanding and support.\n\nHowever, instead of contributing meaningfully to the conversation, I made a comment that was thoughtless and inappropriate. Right before I made the comment, I had been on the phone with someone discussing boundaries and preferences, and I had asked questions about what she liked. When I saw the post, the coincidence struck me, and without pausing to think, I typed out my thoughts. I shared too much personal information in a way that didn‚Äôt belong there.

My comment upset people‚Äîunderstandably‚Äîand it turned into a heated argument. I struggle with PTSD, and when I felt overwhelmed and attacked, I lashed out instead of stepping back. I triggered others, particularly women who were already dealing with their own pain, and I made things worse. I deeply regret that my words and defensiveness caused harm to others.\n\nTo the women who felt triggered by my actions: I am truly sorry. I let my emotions and defensiveness get the better of me, and I failed to respond with care and respect. I didn‚Äôt think about how my words might affect people in a space where vulnerability and support are so important.\n\nFor anyone else who saw what happened and felt uncomfortable, I apologize as well. My behavior was unacceptable, and I take full responsibility for it.\n\nThis experience has made me realize that I need to pause and think before I speak or type‚Äîespecially in sensitive spaces like this one. I need to center the experiences of others and not let my own defensiveness take over.\n",

Usually, it's not this bad, but I lost my safe space recently, I pushed away someone I felt safer with than anyone else, who felt like the closest thing to a parent I had.\n\nThe best advice for PTSD according to an old post on this sub is apparently to ‚Äústop trying to be who you were before the trauma‚Äù However, for me, that person never existed. There was never a ‚Äúhappy innocent kid‚Äù, just a blissfully ignorant kid, who was abused since birth and didn't know better. I don't have nightmares, like \"typical\" cases of PTSD, rather, it's more so an uncontrollable imagining of my countless abusers harming me, and thinking about the stuff I've mentioned in my previous post, which is preventing me from sleeping, and recently, it's been the fear that this person I felt safe with absolutely despises me, and that my abusers and people online are going to make him hate me more.\n\nI've resorted to coming up with imaginary scenarios in my head to combat those dark thoughts and think of what it'd be like to have a caring family, or just pretend that the man I felt safe with actually was my father, but then I just get more upset knowing that's not the case.\n\nI do wonder what my brother's life is like, having a caring girlfriend he can vent to and being big enough that nobody can harm him.

I never got to be my own person, I spent my entire life acting out for attention I never got from my family. I've spent the last five years spending every dime on a hobby I don't even enjoy anymore, for acceptance from a community that couldn't care less, and I feel like I've lost my sense of self. I don't enjoy anything anymore.\n\nAnd I vented so much to that one man and pushed him away and lost my safe space, and I fear I didn't make things safe or comfortable for him, and I fear I'll never meet anyone like him ever again.",

I‚Äôve been in and out of counselling and therapy since I was 12 years old (still am but can only afford a reduced-cost, time-limited program for SA survivors).

I've joined AA and am attempting sobriety because I know that alcohol is not a good coping strategy and it is harmful. \n\nI know episodes happen and it will pass but damn it sucks and I hate how it impacts my loved ones. How long do your flare ups typically last? This is the longest I've ever had. How do you get anything done? I've already missed some work but can't be out forever. Anyway -mostly just need to get this out and hoping for some support. ",

We used to get tornado warnings all the time and it wouldn‚Äôt really mean anything because they would be out in the water not really causing any damage well one day I was hanging out with my brothers and we were playing some Xbox while the storm was going on outside when an alert for a tornado touching, the ground appeared on my phone. I didn‚Äôt really think anything of it because again we used to get them all the time well couple minutes later the power goes out and I get curious if the transformer outside blew down because of the wind. As I go to inspect outside in my front yard, I open the door to get a look at the transformer and I see debris flying through the air and I immediately knew what it was. I slam the door and run and grab my youngest brother and yell for my mom as all of us get into the bathroom and take cover in the bathtub. I heard the tornado ripping apart the giant silver oak tree in my back yard and slam into the side of my house. It was the longest 5 minutes of my life. My mother was praying, my little brothers were crying, and I‚Äôm trying my best not to go into a panic but ultimately failing. House siding was completely destroyed and we had a couple holes in our roof from the tree falling onto it. We ended up having to move out. Ever since then, any time we have a bad storm, I start to panic a little bit. Every strong gust of wind I shake, every time the power goes out I start freaking the fuck out. Any time there‚Äôs a tornado watch I‚Äôm constantly looking at the radar trying to get updates. I guess the good thing from it all is I‚Äôve become obsessed with natural disasters even though it scares the shit out of me.

As a partner she always made me feel safe, and it was the closest I‚Äôve ever been with a partner. \n\nThe scariest thing was that I had been fully present during and then all of a sudden I went somewhere else, freaked out, grabbed my gfs hand away from me and immediately burst into tears. I remember vague details of the flashback, some kind of blanket maybe? But it was mostly just the feeling. I‚Äôve not experienced that sort of terror before and that was also evident to her given my facial expression/reaction. After that I struggled to be intimate for a long while, even though I trusted her, anything like that would result in me feeling so distressed, it was like my inner child was trying to crawl out of my own body. \n\nI‚Äôve only ever had intimate relationships with women, and it generally takes me a little bit to feel fully comfortable being on the receiving end. It‚Äôs something I find extremely uncomfortable and a bit anxiety provoking, unless I feel safe being vulnerable in that way with my partner. \n\nI‚Äôm not really sure what I‚Äôm asking here, but I guess I want to know I‚Äôm not alone? And what I can expect next? We broke up for other reasons but this is something that weighs on my mind heavily in terms of dating again, what if it happens again? \n\nIt‚Äôs also made me question my sexuality, I‚Äôve always found men attractive but always been confused between wanting to be them and the former. Mostly the thought of being with a man has been repulsive to me, but there is a part of me that‚Äôs curious, and also attracted to the idea of being intimate with a man, but now it seems like the repulsion is more a deep sense of distrust? Like I could never trust a man would be safe, to be able to be vulnerable in that sense with them? \n\nI don‚Äôt really know what I‚Äôm asking here, I just know I‚Äôm scared of the reality of why that happened. I‚Äôve never been sexually assaulted by a man and have always counted myself lucky, but now I‚Äôm not so sure if that‚Äôs true. ",

    "selftext": "I want to preface this post that I(18) have not been diagnosed with ptsd and that I am willing to take this post down if it doesn't belong into this subreddit. Please also excuse the cohesion of this text as I am sleep deprived and English is not my first language. \n\n  \nAbout a year ago I went on a school trip to another town in a \"Be a university student for a week\" project. We stayed in a motel in a room of 6 people (even if there were 8 beds) and the security wasn't the best. The Wednesday of that week, due to a sled of unfortunate circumstances, a couple of robbers broke into our room, stole some things and left again without waking anyone up. I wasn't one of the people who had something stolen nor was I awake, nor have I seen the security footage that the motel provided. \n\nBut now over a year later I am alone for a few weeks in my family's flat and I am suffering from fear of someone breaking in, or finding the door unlocked in the morning and similar things. Every night since my family left, around 22pm I start feeling uneasy and hypervigilant, and I can't sleep because of it. Most nights this past week I went to bed around 4AM (2am if I'm lucky) and have to get up at 6:30am. I am exhausted, I really on energy drinks and naps after school  (sometimes during class) to get through the day. I can not continue living like this and I am desperate. When i try to search on google it gives me long term answers like changing my diet or being more active but I can't change that in the span of a few weeks. \n\n\n\nI was wondering if anyone has had similar experiences and has anything that helped them. I tried sleeping in the living room since thats relatively closer to the front door than my room, but that didn't help. The best I have tried is to sleep with my night light on and just try to tire myself out or distract myself with youtube videos, but it doesn't always work. \n\nThank you for reading this and any potentional tips.  \n\n ",

Recently I‚Äôve been thinking about whether I struggle with hyper vigilance or not. At first, I really didn‚Äôt think so. But then, I started to think, and realised that I actually am on guard quite a lot. Maybe I‚Äôm just so used to feeling that way, and therefore it‚Äôs normal for me (my trauma happened during childhood so I‚Äôve always been affected by it).\n\nWith that being said - does anyone else think that wearing noice cancelling headphones/having your hearing restricted is scary? I feel like I wanna be aware of my surroundings all of the time, and if i‚Äôm not, I‚Äôm loosing control. I feel like I always want to be able to escape as soon as possible, if I‚Äôm suspecting danger. Normal headphones/earplugs that slightly restrict your hearing aren‚Äôt a problem, but the thought of being more or less unable to hear makes me wanna crawl out of my skin.\n\nCould this be result of trauma, and can anyone relate?

    "selftext": "So I have been at my job for around 3 years. Since I started, I‚Äôve been working with a manager who doesn‚Äôt work many hours/days but when we work together she treats everyone horribly. When I first started I almost quit over it, but I gained strength and stopped taking her bullying and was able to just walk away and get over it. She stopped getting to me which I was proud of. We all hate her but learned a way to ignore it. \n\nHowever, last night was a brutal shift. She worked pretty much the whole day. I don‚Äôt want to get into the entire story, but she was on a rampage towards everyone that day and acting worse than ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. I was in a bad mood like everyone else, but just focused on getting through my shift and looking forward to my plans afterwards. \n\nAt one point though, something happened to my coworker(who I am close with) caused by a customer which was a crime that needed the police to be involved. I had just gotten out of the bathroom and all of this happened within the span of 5 minutes while I was in there. I didn‚Äôt know what was going on or whether or not the manager knew, obviously you go to your manager when something this serious happens. I check on my coworker who is upset and after walking away to let her call someone, I get yelled at by said manager to ‚Äúdo my job‚Äù which I had been but just took one second to check on my coworker who was in tears. I told her I was and simply told her what had happened and that police needed to be called. \n\nWe were in a narrow hallway in the back and she proceeded to actually scream at me. Instead of letting me know that she had already began to take care of the situation(because how the hell am I supposed to know if she‚Äôs aware of what happened??), she physically backed me into a corner and was 2 inches away from my face. Screaming and going on about how ‚ÄúI am the manager! You are not!! I ALWAYS take care of everything so you should know I‚Äôve taken care of it.‚Äù How the fuck was I supposed to know?! She continues to belittle me and say that I‚Äôm not involved despite me serving this said customer(the police wanted to talk to me for a description after all) and all I wanted was to make sure my coworker/friend was taken care of. That‚Äôs it. She keeps yelling at me to do my job as if I hadn‚Äôt been and tells me to go away so I do. \n\nI distract myself with my nice customers and interact with them to get my mind off of it because at this point I‚Äôm holding back tears and shaking. A few minutes later she tells me to go into the office to talk. I sit down, feeling numb and she continues to berate me. Saying that I was undermining her and that I should have ASSUMED she was on it(she wasn‚Äôt). I try explaining that in the moment all I cared about was making sure my friend was okay and that she was aware of the situation. After all, how am I undermining her if I go to her, the boss lady for this issue?? She keeps interrupting me, asking me a question which I try to answer and then continues yapping when I try to answer the questions she asks. I finally stand up for myself and ask if she genuinely wants answers to my questions at all since she won‚Äôt let me speak. She keeps trying to get the last word in and tries to send me away but I stand my ground and continue to make my points. \n\nShe asks why id ‚Äúinvolve‚Äù myself. Because I was taking care of this customer and my friend was distraught after a crime was committed. She tried making the argument that friends and work don‚Äôt mix. I tell her it doesn‚Äôt matter if she was my friend or not, I could dislike a coworker yet still have basic human empathy to check on them and LET YOU KNOW about the situation. I told her I wasn‚Äôt trying to undermine her position. Again she won‚Äôt let me talk, I continue to sit and keep talking which was scary but I‚Äôm proud I didn‚Äôt just let her yap at me rather than having an adult discussion. Finally I get the courage to say ‚Äúby the way, I would really appreciate it if you NEVER screamed in my face again.‚Äù To which she responds with something along the lines of ‚Äúthen don‚Äôt give me a reason to.‚Äù I walked away shaking.\n\nAfter clocking out, I didn‚Äôt even go to my plans. I couldn‚Äôt. I got home and had a severe panic attack with disassociation. I just felt so humiliated, hurt and distraught that a person could treat someone so badly. Physically backing me into a corner and screaming in my face is what put me into fight or flight. I feel so set back and today I feel just sad, drained and my self esteem has plummeted. I was in an optimistic mood all week despite dealing with depression. \n\nI‚Äôm having a talk with the head manager today about what happened but I don‚Äôt know what to do to feel better. I am proud of myself for remaining calm in the moment and standing my ground, but now I just want to stay in bed honestly and I don‚Äôt know how to get my mind off of it‚Ä¶",

    "title": "Warning: \"The Body keeps the score\" is a disrespectful and damaging book on PTSD with wide acclaim",
    "selftext": "So I bought the book \"The body keeps the score\" after it was recommended by a mental health youtuber. And I am disturbed at the cult following this book has gained despite spreading very damaging and false information and views.\n\nI have not read beyond chapter 1 and I don't want to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Author encourages sympathy for war criminals\n2. Author dismisses Vietnamese genocide\n3. Author devalues trauma of non-Veteran PTSD victims. This is damaging to the PTSD community as it is a widespread and false stereotype that only Veterans \"deserve\" to claim PTSD. Meaning it goes widely undiagnosed. In reality less than 5% of PTSD sufferers are Veterans. It has taken DECADES to dispell this stereotype and he just reintroduced it. Good job.\n4. Author expresses his opinion that the suffering of Veterans is greater than that of rape victims. Which is weird and highly inappropriate for a psychiatrist. It doesn't matter if one persons pain is not as great as another's, they still deserve to seek help. It's made even weirder by how he defends and expresses sympathy for actual rapists. Going as far as saying \"they were traumatised by their own actions\" WTFFFF????\n5. That's not trauma, that's guilt. By definition, trauma is something that happens to you, a psychiatrist should know that.\n6. Author references the Nazi's but doesn't actually condemn their actions which is suspicious. In fact he seems to be on the wrong side of the Nuremberg trials. While at least the Nazis could claim that they were following orders, the Veterans he defends committed their rape and child murder out of fun\n7. He is Dutch, which is where I live. Therefore I know he would have had to read Hannah Arendts \"the banality of evil\" in high school and been exposed to thought experiments and debates on whether following orders counts as warcrime and how much personal responsibility soldiers have since 1st grade. He even grew up during the Nuremberg trial, and claims his father was imprisoned in a concentration camp during WW2. It's not like he is an American who has never been exposed to or had to actually think about these topics. It's like he came up with a strange twisted defence of warcrime to rationalise what happened to his father.\n8. The message of the book seems to be \"forgive your rapist, he suffers more from the trauma of your rape than you do\"\n\nAnd don't even get me started on all the scientific inaccuracies and absolute lack of references. All his claims are based on personal experience supported by anecdotes. It referenced discredited techniques, like Rorschach tests, seriously? This book came out in 2016. I legitimately thought this book predates \"Banality of evil\" and the Nuremberg trial considering how immature and underdeveloped his theories are.\n\nAbsolute garbage! Hope it gets cancelled before it does more damage to the PTSD community. This is the equivalent of the \"vaccines cause Autism\"- paper for PTSD.\n\nEDIT:\n\nSince so many people are trying to gaslight me into denying that what I say actually happens in the book, I wanted to share a quote I found on the goodreads review page of this book, so that you have more than just me as a source that this book is problematic, and that the things I state actually happen in ch1. [https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18693771-the-body-keeps-the-score](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18693771-the-body-keeps-the-score)\n\n\" As a survivor of sexual abuse and trauma, I found this book triggering and lacking the enlightenment I expected, given the reviews. I felt the author showed more compassion for the soldiers who raped and murdered than the rape victims, and the ways in which he discussed the two left me feeling the women weren't as well humanized. Speaking about this with another trauma survivor, she shared that the author was removed from his own trauma center for creating a hostile work environment for women employees. There are articles to confirm it. I rarely‚Äîif ever‚Äîdon't finish a book, but I'm shelving this one.

    "selftext": "14F here. So this morning I posted here about whether I should tell my dad about my mom‚Äôs abuse. He didn‚Äôt know because she would only do it when he was at work or deployed. After reading all of the supportive comments and advice, I decided to tell him. Some of you advised that I showed him the post or write a letter, and I decided to do the latter. \n\nBasically I explained in the letter that she would explode in anger when I did something wrong and briefly described the incidents I talked about in my previous post. I also admitted that the abuse was causing me to be suicidal. I then said I had been scared of telling him because I didn‚Äôt want to cause the end of their marriage and his job, but I needed to tell him because it had been getting worse and worse and I needed help. \n\nI had the letter written and when my Dad got home from work I asked to talk to him. We went up to my room, he sat on my bed, and I gave him the letter. It‚Äôs hard to describe what I was feeling in that moment. Knowing that our whole lives could change when he read it, for better or worse. I watched his face as he read it and had my hands clasped so tightly together to stop them from shaking that it hurt. His face said a lot. His eyes widened really big, and then he looked really sad. \n\nWhen he finally finished the letter, he got up and hugged me. He then started crying. My dad doesn‚Äôt cry often, and I‚Äôve never seen him cry this much. He kept saying how sorry he was. I just stood there let him hug me. The relief I felt that he believed me was immeasurable. When he let go, he held onto my hands and asked if I would be okay up here while he went to talk to my mom. He looked worried, and I was confused at first until I realized he probably asked because I said I was suicidal. I told him I would, and that I wasn‚Äôt actively suicidal. There were just times, usually right after she‚Äôd hurt me, that I felt that way. He looked pretty broken up by that but he nodded and told me to pack some clothes and things because we would likely leave for the night and go to a hotel. \n\nWhile I was packing I could hear them. My Mom was denying it at first, but I guess my dad shut that down because then she started crying and screaming about how I was literally useless around the house and would never make it in the world if I didn‚Äôt mature. I should mention that in my 14 years, my dad never once raised his voice at my mom. She was always the yeller of the family, even to him sometimes. But he yelled at her that I was a child not her servant, and that abusing me would not prepare me for adulthood, it would prevent me from getting to adulthood. I got chills when he said that. \n\nA couple minutes later, he came back up, gave me another hug, and told me we were going to stay at a hotel for the night. I asked if they were getting a divorce, and he said yes, but it wasn‚Äôt because of me. He said he couldn‚Äôt be married to an abuser, and thanked me for telling him. He said he was so sorry that he didn‚Äôt know sooner, and that as soon as things got settled, he would get me therapy because knowing I had ever felt like I wanted to die had scared him a lot, and he wanted to everything he could to help me never feel like that again. \n\nAaaand that‚Äôs when I started crying. It was a good few minutes before we actually left. He just held me while I cried out all that stress that had been building. I couldn‚Äôt believe it was really over. I‚Äôm in the car now with him on the way to the hotel. I tried asking about his job and custody but he said that he would worry about all that, but that he would tell me once he got everything sorted out. He also said public school could be scary but nothing like my mom made it out to be (I was homeschooled and she was using the threat of public school as one of the things to keep me from telling him) but that was another thing that would come in time, he said.\n\nThank you to everyone here who gave me the courage to tell him the truth. Uncertain times are far from over, but I can finally feel safe and protected, and that I‚Äôm not alone. Telling him was probably the hardest but best thing I‚Äôve ever done, and it looks like overall things are looking up. I will never forget the support you all gave me.",

    "selftext": "Who else is so tired of being in survival mode constantly due to this unsafe world and your hypersensitivity to it with CPTSD?\n\nI usually am hypervigilant and quick to advocate for myself as a result of my trauma history--racial, sexual, and emotional abuse. I've spent a lot of my life being gaslighted and mistreated. I have become more confident in standing up for myself, setting boundaries and trusting my intuition these days. I love and respect myself and do not tolerate others who abuse or  disrespect my boundaries. I have always been assertive and have leadership qualities, so this is also part of who I am and who I have to be to survive. \n\nI want to live in a mental and physical space where I can let down my guard and calm my nervous system so I don't feel the need to put all my energy into advocating and fighting back every time with all my force as if I am dealing with racist, sexist, narcissists or sociopathic abusers everytime. This unsafe world is draining my energy as I frequently have to be in survival mode. When I do let my guard down, I am vulnerable to be attacked or preyed on--recently I have been experiencing racial and sexual harassment. \n\n((The world is not always unsafe of course, Sometimes there are just miscommunications and people are not out to get me or don't have deceitful intentions due to racism, sexism, etc. I have had to check myself when it was time to let an issue go as I am not able to control everything just myself. There have been times I was embarassed for jumping to conclusions and being overly suspicious and mad when someone was not being deceitful and there was a misunderstanding instead.))\n\nI am working on finding safe physical, mental, and spiritual places where I do not feel the need to protect myself as much and can conserve my energy to heal from cPTSD. I cannot expect to heal as effectively when I am in a place where I keep getting burnt by more abuse. I need to be safe first. It is tough though because as a black mixed woman, there are a lot of places where I am not safe and I have to advocate for myself due to people being out to get me or mistreating me. I cannot wait to move next year to a place where I do feel safer and can let my guard down more and can heal my CPTSD.\n\nWho else is struggling with being in survival mode constantly due to this  unsafe world and your hypersensitivity to it with CPTSD history? How are you dealing with it?",

    "selftext": "I've never said this to anyone, especially not trauma survivors, but I dislike the belief that trauma molds people into better, stronger people. I think anyone who experiences trauma has a right to feel stronger, more empathetic, braver, etc. if that is what they feel from their unique experience. But it's okay to not feel that way. It's okay to feel angry, sad, scared, hurt, and any negative feeling that comes from experiencing a traumatic event.\n\nI am a survivor of childhood sexual assault and I f-ing refuse to attribute my positive qualities and achievements to those traumas. Before the traumas I was happy, confident, full of life, trusting. The sexual assaults literally altered my body and brain development. My childhood was hell. It was my inherent strength that got me through, not the events themselves. \n\nMaybe for some people, their trauma helped them see that they were strong and brave all along, but I already knew that about myself BEFORE it happened. I actually lost confidence in myself for not being able to stop the abuse when I tried. \n\nI'm not some happy, smiling, cheerleader who says, \"Rape made me better\" because it didn't. Maybe for some people, it does, but not for me.\n\n**ETA: I know why some survivors say their trauma helped them grow to be stronger, more thoughtful, and better people BECAUSE they made themselves learn to cope in healthy and beneficial ways which makes them feel stronger as people. There's nothing wrong with that and that is what I agree with. That is an empowering thing to know YOU got YOU through. Not the adversity, but what you did to face it and overcome it. But some people don't attribute their strengths and positive experiences from the trauma(s) itself and that's okay. Everyone's feelings are valid, but we do not all feel the same and should not be lumped together. Please don't invalidate commenters in this thread for discussing their feelings because it's not easy to talk about this. Thank you**",

Eg: omg that tik tok was so stupid it gave me PTSD, they changed the formula in my favourite lipstick - now I have PTSD, ugh minions are so annoying they gave me PTSD. \n\nIt just rubs me up the wrong way to hear it used as a joke to replace 'annoyed' or 'shocked' or 'having a tantrum'. \n\nDon't even get me started on the \"hashtagtriggeredüòã\" stuff.

    "title": "I survived a mass shooting 4 weeks ago. I'm an ICU nurse and I can't make it through a full shift without breaking down. I'm afraid and alone and need support",
    "selftext": "Throwaway because these details will make me easily identifiable.\n\nI'm an ICU nurse. Covid came to the states right after I got off orientation at my first ICU job. I was working in an inner city safety net hospital. None of my patients had health insurance- they were all well below the poverty line and unable to afford medical treatment, so by the time they came to the hospital, they were essentially already dead. 100% of our intubated covid patients died. Post mortem care was a daily part of my job for quite a long time. We ran out of body bags. We had to stack bodies in the morgue. Unsurprisingly, I was diagnosed with PTSD. I lost almost all my close friends during covid, either because I didn't have the emotional energy to keep up with them, or because we disagreed about masking/vaccines.\n\nBut somehow I managed to carry on... I left that job and worked at another, nicer hospital. Then I left that hospital and recently started a job at an even newer, nicer hospital. I got married. Things were starting to look up for me, but I still felt incredibly fragile emotionally. Every day was hard, but I pushed through in the hopes that things would get better.\n\nThen on the fourth of July, I took my husband to see a parade. He is a foreigner who has never been to a fourth of July parade before, and he was so excited to see this part of American culture.\n\nIt was the Highland Park parade. I don't really want to go into detail about it, but I will say we were not even five feet away from some of the victims that didn't make it. We were directly in the line of the gunman's fire. We saw and heard and felt things no human is supposed to experience. Miraculously, we got away completely (physically) unharmed.\n\nI took an unpaid leave of absence from work- they only gave me a week. I'm still on orientation and still in the probationary period, so I didn't qualify for FMLA, short term disability, or any of the other benefits I signed up for. I came back to work after that week and lasted until about 12pm, at which point I had a flashback and had to leave my shift. It was super embarrassing, I was a mess and left the unit in tears. I then had a full blown panic attack in the bathroom and it took 45 minutes to compose myself enough to even leave the hospital.\n\nMy manager reached out to me and gave me an additional 2 week (unpaid) leave. I desperately needed every minute of that leave, but I felt no more ready when it came time to go back. I made it through 4 shifts without any hitches or problems. But on my 5th shift- yesterday- I just couldn't cope. I had hardly slept- the nightmares wake me up and keep me up. My brain was foggy and I was missing things, fucking things up, and forgetting things I never have. My preceptor confronted me about it, and I completely broke down. I was physically unable to stop crying. My preceptor and I went into my manager's office. They were supportive and told me I don't need to be embarrassed. They let me go home early. But they did tell me that I need to think long and hard about whether or not I can handle this job right now. They can't give me any more time off, since I'm still in orientation. They want me working there... they need staff, and I have experience which few of the other new hires do. But the implication was basically \"either you need to figure out how to be ok and make it through your shifts, or you can't work here anymore.\"\n\nThree of my closest friends have told me that my issues are too much for them to deal with and they're not in a place themselves to emotionally support me right now. One friend even said that my texts were \"triggering\" for her and that she didn't want to contact me at all. We'd been friends for 24 years. She's blocked my number now. We were already on rocky terms because we argued about covid, but I thought she'd be willing to put our differences aside in this situation. Guess not.\n\nI have a therapist, a really good one, but it's not enough. the amount of support I need is not support that one sole person can provide. I'm terrified of opening up to my husband in fear that I'll burn him out too... losing a friendship after 24 years has destroyed my sense of trust and my belief that unconditional love exists. My problems have already been \"too much to handle\" for three friends. I feel my trauma has turned me into an emotional vampire and the last thing I want to do is cause my husband- who went through this trauma too- more pain. I don't just \"feel like a burden\", I *am* a burden and have explicitly been told by some of the people closest to me that I'm a burden.\n\nMy support system is pretty much just my husband and my therapist right now, and it's just not cutting it. I called a crisis support line today. It was essentially 15 minutes of me hysterically crying. Then the crisis counsellor told me she had to leave. She established I wasn't going to kill myself, and hung up. In my head, I'm thinking to myself, \"Great. Scared another one away.\"\n\nI don't know what to do. I don't feel like another job would be any easier for me than this one, so quitting this job and finding another doesn't feel like much of a solution. And I need to work- I'm sponsoring my husband's green card. I worked so hard to get to where I am career wise and I don't want a mass shooter to take that from me.\n\nI don't even know what I'm asking for. I'll take advice, or even just acknowledgement. If you've read this far, thank you. I just needed to be heard and I didn't know where else to turn.",

He was my first experience and it was particularly prolonged and violent so it had a huge negative impact on my life and the PTSD was all encompassing. It‚Äôs been over a decade since then and I‚Äôm just getting frustrated. I keep things a secret from my friends and don‚Äôt like to burden people‚Ä¶so I‚Äôve come here‚Ä¶thinking Reddit will have some sort of solution that I haven‚Äôt thought of. \n\nEdit (9:30 AM EST 7/26): Thank you all so much for the support and help brainstorming. I didn‚Äôt expect this at all and I appreciate it so so much ü•πüò≠. I‚Äôve been largely alone with my thoughts for many years so this has blown my world open. Y‚Äôall tap into all my extreme wants and emotions in every different direction very well. For defamation suit reasons not going to share who he is here now üòî\n\nEdit 2: Thank you guys so so much again. This has been life changing for me. It‚Äôs like a breath of fresh air to have more hope than I‚Äôve ever had and to feel less completely powerless. Lessons learned that managing things on your own can lead me to heavily skewed protective opinions. I wish I had done this sooner",

While there was slightly more votes (only about 20) for joining the blackout, the difference was minimal, and important points were raised why we shouldn't join the blackout.\n\nTherefore, the mods of r/ptsd have made the decision not to close or restrict r/ptsd during the protest of the API changes from 12th to 14th of June.  Anything can happen in 48 hours, and for those who may need support most, we don't want to take this platform from them.  Unlike what reddit is doing to people with disabilities.\n\nWe do however still support other subreddits going dark temporarily and permanently, and the mods will be individually participing in the protest in other ways.  We invite you to find ways to protest (respectfully) as well.  What reddit is doing is not acceptable and will have detremental effects to the platform. More details are available [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/13zbf3n/reddit_to_the_visually_impaired_you_no_longer/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: please don't spend money on rewards. If you want to donate, donate to a ptsd focused organisation, or one for rape survivors, or one that helps trans people, to name a few.  Reddit doesn't deserve your money.",

They did a video conference from the prison.  And no one showed up in support of him or even to do an impact statement. No one he knew cares about him anymore. There's no one who wants him released. He has nothing and no one and I'm glad.\nEven if he does get out, there's at least 7 men in my family who own guns and want to shoot him and he's well aware of that so he'd probably stay away.

It's really insulting and frusterating you know? Like yeah that would be VERY embarrassing and mortifying but like C'mon. You're an adult now, build a bridge and get over it. There's \"Don't compare your trauma to others,\" and then there's shit like that. It just irks me when people act like every tiny hardship in their life is ~trauma~. No. You don't know what that word means. That word actually means something to people and to mental health professionals.\n\nI also hate how terms like \"disassociate\" or \"intrusive thoughts\" became a quickly personality trait and then memes. Because even though my psychologist has identified these for me and said that what I'm experiencing, I still don't like to say that's what I'm experiencing. Like I feel like I'm making it up to be quirky or be funny or some shit. But it's not...I will struggle with talking to my therapist about having trouble with intrusive thoughts or not knowing where I was the last 4 fucking hours because I got triggered and disassociated.

When he raped me I was at home and i told him I didn‚Äôt want to have sex before he came over, maybe I shouldnt have let him in.. i was in my pajamas, a two piece short set.. maybe I shouldn‚Äôt have worn that and he wouldn‚Äôt have done it? We made out before it happened which led to the rape.. maybe I shouldn‚Äôt have done that? I moaned when he gave me oral it seemed like it felt good? Even now I‚Äôm questioning myself if it actually felt good or did my body just think it did? While he was penetrating me I didn‚Äôt do anything but lay there and space out and the only words I could really mumble were ‚ÄúI said I didn‚Äôt want to do this‚Äù and he just kept saying ‚Äúdon‚Äôt tell me no, I don‚Äôt like when you tell me no‚Äù‚Ä¶ I should‚Äôve fought harder. I‚Äôm such an advocate for victims not blaming themselves for their assault but having a really hard time giving myself that grace because maybe just maybe if I would‚Äôve been smarter, wore a different outfit then it wouldn‚Äôt have happened. How could I even feel any arousal while something like that was happening? I even considered trying to have consensual sex with him afterwards to balance it out‚Ä¶ if I wanted it this time then the rape wouldn‚Äôt really be a rape‚Ä¶right? I‚Äôm not sure what to do and it feels like I‚Äôm slowly losing my sanity. No one around me knows, I‚Äôm too guilty to say that I even felt a bit of pleasure during it. I‚Äôm losing myself it seems little by little day by day. I don‚Äôt think he even realizes he raped me, I mean he did say I was making him feel bad by the way I responded afterwards but why would he still try to keep in contact with me if he knew he raped me? Why did I answer the phone when he called even though it gave me panic attacks?? What‚Äôs wrong with me?? Was it even rape if he wasn‚Äôt rough with me? My brain is just a black ball of scribbles, it feels like I‚Äôm slowly decaying. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever be the same.  ",

    "selftext": "There's a real push in PC culture right now for not just people with PTSD but rape and abuse victims also to not call themselves \"victim\" but rather \"survivor\". The problem with that is, I WAS victimized. That kind of language benefits the people who harm us, because if they see us as \"survivors\" than they can go on abusing us and it's like it doesn't matter. You can do anything to a \"survivor\". Also, it shames people coming forward because the word \"victim\" has become negative and shameful. I think instead of replacing \"victim\" with another word, we should be making it so that \"victim\" is not a shameful thing to be. You hear whining mostly on the right, mostly aimed at women, about people, mostly women, accused of \"playing the victim\". The solution to that isn't to call yourself something else, but to assert that yes, I am a victim, but no I am not playing or pretending. This all actually happened to me. If I were a \"survivor\" I feel like that just makes me violable because I'm then expected to be \"tough enough\" to \"handle it\". It puts pressure on victims by telling US to get over it and cope and be strong, rather than pressuring abusers to change THEIR shitty patterns of behavior. I understand that individual people might like feeling like a \"survivor\", but I feel like the label is toxic because it's telling the victims how to approach handling being victimized. I do want to be a victim, because I was one, and fuck anyone telling me what to call myself. \n\nThis was also brought up in the second season of *Thirteen Reasons Why*, and I thought, like many mental health issues in that show, that it was handled in such a garbage way. Basically, a main character was raped while under the influence of alcohol at a party. She has a hard time getting over it. A feminist in charge of a \"rape survivors\" group tells her to join them \"when you're ready to stop being a victim and start being a survivor\". In other words, her shaming the character into being the right kind of \"strong survivor\" type of person, and being sad was seen as weak. She was also shaming her into going forward with legal action against her rapist. The show acted like it was important that she do that, no sympathy for victims who do not report. I feel like this is reflective of larger problems with society wanting everyone to always project an aura of strength and confidence, where we bully, ridicule, and shame people for being weak or emotionally damaged.",

It didn‚Äôt bother me that people were saying I was in the wrong, but the hurtful and arrogant comments were ridiculous. Just goes to show that most people have no idea what PTSD is. They think it‚Äôs about as big as someone going to war and being scared of fireworks after. Which everyone in this subreddit can vouch could not be further from the reality we live every day. It makes me really sad that people aren‚Äôt only uneducated on the topic, but unwilling to learn. PTSD is such a heavy and all consuming disorder, and it‚Äôs constantly shit on. I wish there were more organizations or promo of PTSD awareness. I felt so alone and overwhelmed until I started reading these comments. People who are educated on the topic, whether they think I‚Äôm being over sensitive or if they agree with me, are still respecting my trauma and not bashing my mental illness.

Like telling myself my trauma \"isn't even that bad\" or that it doesn't warrant PTSD etc. \n\n\nNow I can rationalise these thoughts because my physical symptoms aren't fake. I can't stop the shaking and the hyperventilating. I also hate attention/being fussed over, if anything I get extremely embarrassed. But I was wondering if this is a typical thing? To have your brain tell you that you're just faking it and that it's not that bad?\n\nEdit: everyone responding to this saying they also experience this is very reassuring and comforting\nWishing you all well.",

She asked, isn't survivor more empowering?\n\nFor some people it is, but not for me. I'm not a survivor,  I wasn't struck by lightning, I didn't have cancer, I didn't 'survive' a random event. I'm a victim, not because I'm weak or belittled, but because this was *done to me by another person.* My trauma was a deliberate act done to me by someone else, they deliberately victimised me, and I need to process it as such. \n\nThe word 'victim' has such horrifying stigma, and - don't get me wrong - replacing it with 'survivor' is crucial to other PTSD sufferers' self-definition. But for me it has never sat right. There's an assumption even in trauma services that calling yourself a victim is limiting yourself, or not being strong, having the tendency to see yourself as weak, or not acknowledging how you've powered through it all. Often it's the idea that once you see yourself as a victim or 'victimise yourself' you become pathetic, oversensitive, overreactive, less capable, less than. But I'm none of those things.\n\nI can't process my trauma without accepting and being vocal about its origins. I didn't 'survive' this, because it isn't over. But accepting that I was someone's victim doesn't mean I'm all of the negative connotations of 'victim'.",

You're not a \"member of society\", you're a Burden. A 'leech', for needing anything, anything at all, even something as small as a listening ear or breadcrumb. It's an offense to even suggest you may need help, to suggest that anyone should even consider helping you. Because in their eyes, you must have done something to \"deserve\" poverty, or homeless. It's like a moral branding to them. It doesn't matter how you became severely poor/homeless, and it doesnt matter how desperately you're fighting to survive/escape your circumstances. \"Poor/homeless\" is all they need to know to \"know\" that you're unworthy of help, or of compassion. You're the scum beneath their feet. You're not even human.\n\nEven after being homeless and tormented for a year, and then in poverty for 4, I still feel myself become crushed under the weight of people's disgust for poor/homeless people. It utterly shocks me. It steals the breath from my lungs. \n\nThe internet is full of cruelty and anger, obviously, but..... it's not just on the internet, anyways, not by a longshot. People are not shy about their disgust for poor people, and if you haven't been in extreme poverty you may not have even noticed how bad it is. You may have some deeply rooted hatred and judgement inside you, too. \n\nIt's. horrifying. And it brings me back to the most horrifying days/experiences of my life. I think i had a conclusion to this, but i feel like a child again, starving and absolitely terrified and being proven to that even the mostly seemly compassionate or kind people will turn on you the moment you have no money.

They say they just want to vent and they eventually just want to describe the abuse to you. \n\nI didn‚Äôt report it immediately because i was worried it might be an actual confused child :(\nBut another user messaged me the other day saying she had received the exact same kind of messages from ‚Äúcoder‚Äù (his old username). \n\nI think it‚Äôs safe to say this person is going to a lot of these subs and messaging people. Since they have created new usernames and deleted old ones I also think it‚Äôs safe to say they will continue this behavior. \n\nI‚Äôm sure there are other people like this lurking as well. I just wanted to share this persons particular narrative and method to help you guys identify them if they try writing you from a new username. \n\nStay safe everyone. I know this sucks but we are adults now who can make safe choices and I am trying to see this as an opportunity to practice setting boundaries, and standing up to creeps. The younger me would have given this abuser endless empathy and tried to help them/given them the benefit of the doubt that they were a child in need. \n\nI feel empowered that I am learning to trust my intuition! My gut knew something was off when they first messaged me and it was confirmed when another user told me they experienced the same thing.",

I was stabbed 18 times, mostly in the head and throat, and pushed off the top of Koko Crater. I fell 100 feet. I broke my neck, fractured my skull, both my lungs collapsed, my left lung was punctured, my liver and diaphragm were stabbed, an artery in my temple was severed.\nI lost 5 pints of blood. I was lucky to survive, there have been a few challenges along the way. \n\nI was rear-ended twice while recovering from the broken neck. I was betrayed by the justice system. My attacker was acquitted due to temporary insanity and was put in a mental hospital.\nJust 3 years after trying to murder 2 people, he was granted permission to take college courses at a nearby community college unescorted.\nHe was released in 2018 and gets free healthcare for life. \n\nIn 2021, I was diagnosed with lipodystrophy, a rare metabolic disorder that causes complete fat loss.\nEvery ounce of fat disappears and your organs slowly shut down. I haven‚Äôt laid on my back in 2 years and I haven‚Äôt sat voluntarily in 2 years because my butt fat is gone. Most of my life is spent laying on my stomach. \n\nIt won‚Äôt surprise you that I have PTSD, what might surprise you is that the trauma from my stabbing is a drop in the bucket compared to the trauma of chronic illness. I survived and even overcame maybe the most violent attempted murder ever committed, and yet I‚Äôm taken down by a rare metabolic disorder. Life without fat is exponentially more painful than getting stabbed and pushed off a cliff. Crazy, right? \n\nPeople ask how I‚Äôve survived all this trauma. The answer is simple: I‚Äôm half Japanese and half  Scandinavian. That means I‚Äôm a samurai AND Viking. It‚Äôs hard to kill one, but I‚Äôm both! \n\nThis is a challenging situation and I worry about the future, but I post this to remind you of the strength of the human spirit. I hope this part inspires you: that lunatic tried to stab my brain 6 times. What did I do with that brain? I went back to school and I graduated with a 4.0 and $90,000 in scholarships. I became a published author and wrote and spoke about my survival throughout Hawaii and California. I knit thousands of scarves, beanies, and potholders and sold them to pay for medical bills. I fought for victim‚Äôs rights, and I supported victims and survivors through their trials. I did all these things with PTSD, OCD, anxiety, and severe chronic pain. \n\n‚ÄúLogic may indeed be unshakable, but it cannot withstand a man who is determined to live.‚Äù Franz Kafka",

He was the 3rd out of 5 siblings, but the parents treat the other 4 kids with more love and attention than him. Causing him to act out and be a delinquent. (And Disney loves to copy this dynamic into other shows)\nA more recent example I've seen is in my favorite game Persona 5 the Royal, the character Ryuji had already been physically abused by his dad and coach, then his friends casually called him \"stupid\" and beat up on him. There's even a controversial scene in the original Persona 5 where Ryuji is implied to get assaulted by two stereotypical gay men. And this isn't the first example of a character abused for comedy in the history of Atlus games.\nAs a domestic violence victim who's abuse was treated as comedy or punishment in real life, it brings me back to a time where my pain was used as a punchline. My abuser and his friend thought it was funny when I got upset in response to abuse.

    "selftext": "Several times a week I see a post stating that someone‚Äôs therapist has decided not to give them a diagnosis for PTSD for xyz reason. The conclusion many people come to is that the therapist is dismissing their trauma, they are a bad therapist, or that they are simply uninformed. \n\nWhile it is incredibly important to advocate for yourself, we are also not entitled to a diagnosis simply because we think we have it. There are so many differential diagnoses that carry similar symptoms to PTSD and are trauma related disorders that may be a better fit. You may also have gone through a trauma, have symptoms, but not quite meet the criteria for PTSD. \n\n\nI urge people to really consider how they feel about their therapist overall and how they respond to their pain when it‚Äôs brought up in session. Recognize a pattern of dismissing and go from there. \n\nAnd it‚Äôs worth considering in the comments section that more harm then good can come from telling people whom you don‚Äôt know that their therapist is awful and dismissing them without a fair amount of evidence for it. Because if that‚Äôs not true, the person will carry the belief that yet another person doesn‚Äôt care about them or their trauma. Even if the therapist does care and is still working through the trauma and symptoms of it. \n\nOf course, advocate for yourself, seek a second opinion if needed. Always be aware if a therapist IS dismissing you. But please recognize a therapist‚Äôs job is to decipher all your symptoms and give you a diagnosis that‚Äôs the best fit. And sometimes, it may not be the diagnosis you think you have or are wanting to have. ",

I was on the couch in the fetal position trying to cover my head whilst taking shots.  Then I blacked out.  \n\nThis is about par for the course for grandma.

I‚Äôm at the opposite corner, trapped.  I instinctively grab the other chairs and pull them out, hopping I can use them some how to escape.  We play a game of cat and mouse.  Jab stepping both left and right to see who is going to make the first move.  The stupid bitch takes my bait and goes right to where I faked, I dip and go around the other way.  She lunges at me over the chairs and table, swiping at me with the giant fucking blade in her hand.  I narrowly escape.  I dip and bend my torso to avoid her savage attempts at murdering me.  I sprint down the hall to my room.  I try to shut the door but she‚Äôs right behind me trying to push it back open. I shove the door back into her and just barely get it to close behind me.  I lock the door handle whilst she kicks, punches, and stabs at the door.  All while screaming and screeching that she‚Äôs going to fucking kill me.  \n\nI call the police.  They arrive moments later.  I‚Äôve already packed a bag of my necessities.  I just want to get the fuck out of dodge.

I walk out quietly and tell the cops I just want to leave and go to my friends house.  They oblige.  \n\nThis woman, my grandma, this piece of shit Is the reason that I suffer from PTSD.  I don‚Äôt believe in a heaven or a hell, there is no reasoning or justice for the bull shit that she‚Äôs put me through, but I hope she spends eternity suffering a miserable existence.

She forced herself on me, kissing me, and I caved. Anxiety. Fear, my body saying yes while my mind was trying to escape in fear.\n\nLong story short, we had a back-and-forth love/hate relationship and I was too spineless and weak to break out a partnership in class off. She needed my help with something one night at her house, and she paid me for it. All good. But then she pushed me on the sofa, took our clothes off... and I'll leave the rest up to your imagination. I felt broken, nearly crying in front of her, but then played it off as anxiety and anger, scurrying out of her home, barely putting my clothes back on before exiting the door. 'Was that good for you too, baby?\" She said when she saw me leaving. When I'd tried to fight her off initially, she was like \"I always control the situation. Why would you fight me? Just let it happen, let me ride you, you might like it since you're a virgin, I promise you'll be safe. Learn from your past punishment.\"\n\nI'm pretty logical. I haven't done therapy for this, but previous traumas and never found therapy helpful. But this just gets to me because since I am naturally attracted to women, I have this poor defense when I'm near one because I know that I probably wouldn't be strong enough to fight one off of that happened. When a man did the same, I was able to try at least, to fight it off because there was no level of attraction. Yes, I orgasmed in her and that's what breaks me. I made a vow to save sex for marriage and she forced it out of me. Maybe I shouldn't say forced, since I wasn't strong enough to stop her. If I had... anyway. It's been years since this happened and I feel more ashamed about the girl-raping-guy part than the guy on guy part.\n\nNot sure what my intention here was, I suppose just to vent and see if anyone has relating feelings or experiences.",

    "selftext": "Two nights ago I had a pretty uncomfortable conversation with one of my best friends. I‚Äôm not sure if this necessarily has changed our friendship but it just reinforces that there is a long way to go with society‚Äôs view of mental health issues - especially in healthcare where they are ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù to at least show some compassion in treatment.\n\nBut anyways, my friend is an ER nurse and no lie she works in a pretty rough spot. I know she‚Äôs got to see some shit every hour. I get that. I‚Äôm a school teacher at a rough school too. I get frustrated with shit. I know with my ptsd, I might have something in common with the harder students. So I keep an open mind and heart.\n\nAnyways, that‚Äôs why it was hard when my friend started laughing and talking about one of the patients that came in. She gave me details, it was basically a man who was suffering at first what they thought was hallucinations/paranoia. Turns out he was a war veteran and experiencing severe flashbacks, talking to himself, screaming, flailing, you get the picture. \n\nI was shocked at her tone and how she was laughing, I suppose out of shock herself because she had to help restrain the man and called the cops to transport him to a different psych hospital. At the end of her story, I just said ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you think that could‚Äôve been me? What‚Äôs so funny about that?‚Äù\n\nI could tell immediately she was thrown off and she just started insisting that no, mine was different and blah, blah, blah. Like no. That man and I might have different symptoms/circumstances but we‚Äôre still in the same boat. How am I supposed to feel when a health care professional has that attitude - and when that person knows the delicate details of my own condition? \n\nSorry for this rant but I suppose I needed to get it off my chest. As I‚Äôm wondering how far we have to go in order to get people to understand us, have sympathy. We don‚Äôt choose our triggers, we can‚Äôt wish the trauma away. We can‚Äôt put a band aid on our brains.",

    "selftext": "Ten years ago I traveled abroad with a group for a ‚Äúgap year‚Äù in South America. We had a weird and terrible experience when we went to a spa retreat owned by an ex-pat American man. 7 of the other girls were molested during a ‚Äúspiritual healing‚Äù ceremony without anyone saying a word, they all were 18 and that‚Äôs the only reason I can think they didn‚Äôt speak up. I went last and fought the abuser and got out of there, then went to my group leader with it and as I told her about it the rest of the group chimed in saying ‚Äúme too me too!‚Äù Against our wishes the group leader told the abuser the reason why we decided to leave early, and the abuser came to my room at night to try to tell me it was all innocent. I was still just a kid but I had to be the face of the group. Then our own group‚Äôs leader talked to me about it later in the trip and said it was all a misunderstanding, that things were different back in the hippy days and she was raised with that kind of thing and he didn‚Äôt mean anything by it. I went home from the trip afraid of being touched at all by my significant other and it took months for me to recover enough to just be touched. \n\nFlash forward to today. I watched a documentary about a man who abused foster kids, and at the end the story said the abuser had moved to a tiny island outside Guam where there was little oversight. I remembered my experience and I realized it‚Äôs possible he‚Äôs still out there doing exactly the same thing. Sure enough, his TripAdvisor is full of recent reviews - he‚Äôs definitely still in business. And as I searched I found out a woman went to his establishment and was raped by him, two months after our group‚Äôs visit. She traveled back to his country with her husband to sue him and talk to the media. Reading this really validated my experience because I had been wavering in my mind about the experience all these years. But this was a totally separate incident right at the same time we were there. \n\nSo, I wrote about the experience in detail in their TripAdvisor comments. I explained exactly what happened in that public forum. I felt I needed to take some sort of action and I think this was an impactful thing to do. I‚Äôm worried TripAdvisor might take the comment down. I got a message back from his wife on my review and it essentially said I must be mistaken. It brings me joy to think he and his wife had to revisit this subject yet again, and that I might save someone else from going through what I did. \n\nIt feels good to have done it but it hurts me that I can‚Äôt share it with anyone. I feel empowered but also alone.\n\nEdit: Thank you for the support. I have actually been feeling guilty for possibly hurting this guy‚Äôs family‚Äôs livelihood and started questioning myself, so your support is really appreciated.

We were each other‚Äôs first everything. First kiss, first relationship, etc. and I had noticed that this did make us extremely codependent on the other over time. Me and my husband both struggle with mental health problems. My husband more so than me. \n\nWe got married after being together for 6 years and went right into having children. After we had our first son, things started getting really difficult. My husbands mental health began to spiral. The financial burden became fully his because couldn‚Äôt work due to health complications during my pregnancy. We had also decided that it would be more smart for us financially if I stayed home with our son, rather than getting a babysitter. \n\nOnce our oldest became about two years old, I did go back to work to help relieve some stress and we hired my little sister to help with the kids. It helped a lot financially but my husband pretty much checked out mentally with things involving our marriage and being a parent. During the next (roughly) 3 years and one more child later, our relationship became fully platonic. This is something that deeply bothered me and I felt that we needed to fix because we both deserved better. I told my husband about how I was feeling several times and that I wanted to go to marriage counseling but he was firm on not going because he felt they would recommend separation. Which eventually lead to me asking for a separation because I had become so unhappy. \n\nWe had been separated for a couple of weeks and the amount of peace I felt really made me realize that I wanted a divorce. So I told my husband how I was feeling. This did not go very well. He wasn‚Äôt so much angry, as just giving off a very uncomfortable vibe. I decided to take a bath and try to relax from all of the stress, and that is when I received the text. \n\nIt was a suicide text. And he told me that if he couldn‚Äôt be with me that life was not worth living. The time stamp was two minutes earlier so I knew I needed to hurry to get to my bedroom where he had locked himself in. \n\nI jumped out of the bath, grabbed a towel, tried to open our bedroom door but it was locked (I didn‚Äôt realize he had locked himself is there at this point). So I ran to the kitchen, grabbed a butter knife and slide it into the door frame to unlock the door. Once I got into the room, my two year old had followed me and I didn‚Äôt know this because I was focused on helping my husband. He had locked himself in our master bathroom and I couldn‚Äôt get the door open. \n\nI was shaking the handle, screaming for him, asking what he was doing. He didn‚Äôt answer. I continued to shake the handle and I felt him hold it. And then I heard A loud pop and I heard his body hit the floor. Nothing but a full on wail came out of me. With my two year old right there. I immediately called 911 and grabbed my babies and my sister (she lives with us and heard this from the kitchen) and we waited on the porch, screaming and crying while the police came. \n\nMy husband survived. He lost his right eye and most of his tongue. We do not know what exactly his quality of life will be. But I am grateful he survived. \n\nI‚Äôm also incredibly traumatized. My two year old screams all of the time now too. I have so many emotions it‚Äôs hard to process. I don‚Äôt understand how he could just leave me with all of this.

They think that because we had been together for so long that we need to try to work this out. But now I am terrified of him and my decision to get a divorce just feels more solidified. I want no romantic relationship with him. I have nightmares every night. I have to live in the house where my husband shot himself three feet away from me. And I feel like everyone thinks I‚Äôm this bitch who is abandoning my husband when he needs me the most. \n\nI just don‚Äôt know  where to begin with the healing process. I was given a few resources for counseling but I can‚Äôt bring myself to call yet. I guess I just wanted to share my story on here as a way to relieve from sort of stress.\n\nEDIT: Wow. Thank you all so much. The amount of support I am getting from all of you is incredible. My feelings feel validated and that helps me so much more than I can even describe. I am dealing with immense guilt, anger, depression, all while trying to be a good mom to my babies and trying to survive living in this house where I‚Äôm reminded of the entire ordeal every day. I made an appointment for trauma counseling next week. Just talking to the counselor on the phone was already helpful because I felt validation. So I am hoping this is a step in the right direction. Last night was especially hard and I cried for several hours straight just dealing with all of the pain and emotions and confusion. I am going to start the process in going forward with a divorce because like many of you have stated, my instincts are telling me to run. I have nightmares every night that he is shooting himself in front of me, or running around the house with a gun trying to kill me and my boys. I have never in my life experienced trauma like this and I appreciate all of you for being so supportive and understand. This helps more than you know.",

    "selftext": "Everyone seems to be of the opinion that talking about your trauma or seeking therapy is the healthy way to deal with your trauma. I think to some extent you can find SOME support or validation this way but people don't tell you to brace yourself for the hostility you'll receive when talking about your trauma too.\n\nYou'll lose friends when you talk about trauma. Many people are fair weather friends and will abandon you if you are struggling. Others will stigmatize ptsd. Some will be downright bullies and call you a p*ssy or a coward. Others will minimize your trauma and mock you. Yet if you try to keep the conversation light and joke about your trauma, others will get offended by you and say you're trying to be edgy or call you a troll.\n\nIt seems like so many people misunderstand where I'm coming from when I do try to talk about it and I don't understand WHY they are so mean. I don't understand why it's even advised to talk about your trauma in the first place if there's so many sick people out there that seem to like to kick people when they're low. Every now and then I'll get a mature conversation with someone on the topic, but I think it makes most people uncomfortable. Sometimes I like to analyze things and I will go over a topic ad nauseam and it doesn't bother me but it seems to enrage other people so they lash out at me and I don't know why? \n\nCan anyone relate? And what do you do about it? Do you just keep your trauma to yourself? Are you supposed to lie and pretend nothing bad ever happens? What is the goal even supposed to be when people encourage you to talk about your trauma with others if it only seems to upset other people?",

The first one was where I was alone with a man in a car, he resembled my abuser body shape wise. I was in a parking lot and the man was in the front seat and I in the back. He got out and walked to where I was, I immediately began to panic even though he didn't enter the car. I was thinking that something bad will happen, he entered the car and I scooted away from him, the dream gets blurry from here but I vividly remember that feeling of extreme fear and helplessness while he was hugging me or having his arm around my waist. (I'm scared of hugs because of what happened to me, I guess that might be connected but I don't know) I was just feeling so so terrified, and I felt that exact same blood curdling fear when the traumatic event was happening. I felt completely frozen both in the dream and the original event. \n\nThen I was outside a police station and that's where it ended. (I never reported) \n\nThe second one is a lot more obscure and confusing, it was like any ordinary weird dream, I was driving somewhere, it felt as if I was in a video game, but then I was again at a police station. I was inside of the building and then I hear a 17 year old girl scream, 'get off me, get the fuck off me. I'm 17. Stop it, stop it.'\n\nI began to feel fearful and I froze again, but I got the courage to turn the corner and I caught a small glimps of an older man cuddling this girl, I'm assuming it was tight since she couldn't get away. She started to scream something about her boyfriend but her voice didn't sound like it was a little whimper, it was screams of anger, frustration and being fed up. But the man wouldn't let her go.\n\nThen a woman police officer was way too calmly walking down the hallway this was happening, it looked like she won't do anything about the situation because of the way she walked but I woke up straight after seeing that officer so I don't know if she would've done something or not. \n\nI'm just in a weird place right now. I've been having dreams of sexual assaults/ abuse, even rape (I was never raped) ever since the traumatic event happened. I never had dreams like that before, never. \n\nCan anyone relate to my situation and is this normal??

    "selftext": "Earlier today we were out with some friends, chilling and relaxing as one does. We started to mess around with a ball and a bat and eventually I hear this sickening whack and a moan, I look over and my boyfriend is falling over with a bat stuck to his forehead. I launch into a run and my friend and I drag him inside, same friend that hit him, and I call an ambulance. Skip ahead a bit and the last thing I see of him is him shivering with blood all over his face, in his hair, on the ground, just everywhere and It stains my eyelids. He gets dragged into an ambulance and I can't see him anymore, just the frantic shaking as they work inside. I looked down at my hands and one of them was also coated in blood. And I just couldn't. It is  hours later and I have been uncontrollably sobbing for at least an hour and a half. I don't know why I feel the need to share this story but thank you for reading. I am not really looking for support as I know this feeling will probably fade once he recovers. The doctors said his brain scan was fine and he had no broken or fractured bones so that's something. More than anything I am just immeasurably grateful to still have him in my life and this experience has strengthened my love for him 20 times but that deep dreadful feeling when watching someone you love possibly die, it is haunting and that sound will forever be burned into my mind. Again, thank you for taking the time to read this nightmare.\n\nUpdate: after a few hours of uncontrollable sobbing I eventually passed out while watching over him without even realizing. Thank you for your ideas to help me calm myself. His wound doesn't seem to be any worse after sleeping so I think the healing process is going to be good.\n\nUpdate 2: Things are looking good, after a lot of talking and being there for each other he is forming thoughts and holding focus better now, he was able to sleep off and on but couldn't fully rest. I am also much better now, the recommendation to play Tetris really helped me calm down and I will be forever thankful my eyes were opened to that. But more than anything I am just thankful to have him still. Thank you all for your kind words.",

Our parents were dead, and we‚Äôd survived 2 murders. I was in a verbally and emotionally abusive home. All this led me to feeling worthless and unlovable. \n\nThat‚Äôs why he targeted me. \n\nOver the course of several months, he stopped to talk to me. Got my number. Started calling and slowly built rapport- I now understand this was grooming. After I turned 14, the calling escalated and he drove over to my house to offer yard work. The male figure of my home had recently died so it was just me and the woman raising me. He flattered her. She was old fashioned and thought nothing of a grown man wanting a young girl. \n\nOnce he got approval, the love bombing started. Before long, the sex. I didn‚Äôt even know what to do or how to do it. In short order, his charm eroded. He began controlling me and calling me ugly and worthless. \n\nBy now, I think this is ‚Äúlove‚Äù. He told me it was love. \n\nMy mental health deteriorated and I ended up suicide attempt with a 2 week hospital stay. I also had a venereal disease that had spread very far requiring iv treatment. \n\nI got out and the sexual and emotional abuse resumed and one of his friends was after my young friend to boot! \nHe never took me on a date. Never showed me any gentleness or tender touch.  He brought one of his friends over to meet me. That friend had some sense and told him what he was doing to me was rape. \n\nHe disappeared abruptly. Tried to come back off and on a few times. I told him off. He did the same thing to five other victims of similar age that I know of!\n\nOver the years, my view of love and relationships was warped by what he did to me. I‚Äôve had other traumas since, but trauma has layers like an onion. This is my core wound regarding men. It took me until I was 40 to realize it!\n\nI made a fake Facebook account and I sent his ass a long winded message about how he victimized me and the state it happened in has no statute of limitations on rape of someone the age I was. \n\nI still have photos of him and I, not nude, but sexual enough that I believe I could finally report him and possibly get justice. \nIt felt good to tell him off.

    "title": "Brainspotting therapy - OMG, try it!",
    "selftext": "(3 Month Update Below, outlining how I feel now, why EMDR didnt work for me before and why EMDR works for me now)\n\nI am writing this the night of my first mind blowing experience with this therapy. \n\n4 years of talk therapy for me did nothing. (Results may vary for each person. It may work for you, it just didn‚Äôt for me). \n\nSo I looked into EMDR, because it was hailed as the best for PTSD and especially after reading ‚ÄúThe Body Keeps the Score.‚Äù \n\nBut 8 or 9 sessions in and I just wasn‚Äôt getting it. Feeling it. Just‚Ä¶ nothing. \n\nI was about to quit yet another form of therapy. \n\nThen, my EMDR therapist said ‚Äúhey, I just got certified in something called brain spotting. Wanna give it a go?‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúSure.  What is it?‚Äù \n\nShe then held up a stick with a little ball on the end, looked like a magic wand. \n\n(This was Telehealth by the way.)\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to to move this very slowly down the screen while you think about the traumatic event we‚Äôve been working on. When you feel something, tell me when to stop.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúSomething?‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúLike what?‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôll know when you feel it,‚Äù she said.  \n\n‚ÄúThis is total woo woo new-age bullshit I am about to waste my hard earned money on‚Ä¶‚Äù I thought. ‚ÄúBut, to hell with it. Got nothing to lose.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúJust keep your head still and follow with your eyes,‚Äù she calmly said. \n\nShe then proceeded to move the wand down the screen. Very slowly. \n\nNothing. \n\nNothing. \n\nOkay a little something. \n\nOkay there is pressure in my head. \n\nWow, this is getting intense. \n\nMy face red, and tears forming in my eyes I struggled to finally say ‚Äúright there.‚Äù \n\nI felt it coming to the surface. \n\nShe did the same horizontally across the screen. \n\nNothing, nothing, then BAM! A new spot. \n\nAfter a couple other movements across the screen that yielded nothing, she asked which of the two previous spots felt stronger. \n\nI chose the one, where the little ball rested just below her chin.  \n\nFor the next 40 minutes, in total complete silence, she held the wand in that position and I just stared at it. \n\nIt was an emotional explosion!  I cried like I never had in therapy before. The event would come to the forefront of my mind and I could literally feel it ‚Äúworking it‚Äôs way forward and out!‚Äù \n\nI cried so much staring at that ball that snot was pouring out my nose as i deep weeped. \n\nMy mind started with what I felt was my top trauma, then it suddenly shifted to my brothers death - which was 5 years ago and I felt I had handled it well at the time, all things considered. \n\nBut my brain was now telling me that I hadn‚Äôt processed it yet. \n\nAnd now it was time to do that. \n\nSuddenly, I balled like a child. My subconscious showed me that I had blamed  myself partly for his passing - because I wasn‚Äôt there to help him. \n\nI went from surprise, to sadness, to anger, then ‚Ä¶ self forgiveness. \n\nActual, real, self forgiveness. \n\nThere really wasn‚Äôt anything I could have done to prevent it. And suddenly, I embodied that feeling deeply. \n\nMy emotions oscillated on extremes for the entire 40 minutes. My mind was ‚Ä¶ FIXING THE BURIED! \n\nAnd all I did WAS STARE AT A BALL ON THE END OF A STICK! \n\nWhat??????\n\nMore was done in silence in 40 minutes than 4 years of talking. \n\nAnd I could just simply FEEL it working. \n\nI can‚Äôt explain it, but I was just more clear in my head afterwards. Lighter.  \n\nMy therapist gently smiled and said ‚ÄúI think we found the modality that works for you.‚Äù \n\nI cried even more when she said that. \n\nBecause I knew she was right. I felt like I had reached my therapy ‚Äúhome,‚Äù at last. \n\nIt was brutal and hard- and thats how i knew it was where my healing journey was about to finally begin. \n\nI booked her for weekly visits for two months out, wiped the snot from my nose, cancelled my appointments for the rest of the day and went for a walk in the sun - my mind clear and face grinning for the first time in ages. :)\n\n\n07/24/22 UPDATE:\n\nHey all! Sorry for the delay. Going through a move to a new city but wanted to update you guys on my progress.\n\nI have to say, I‚Äôve felt ‚Ä¶ different. Better, different.\n\nSessions 1-4, were intense, non stop crying for long bouts. 5-7 was about 1/2 crying and ‚Äútrauma work out.‚Äù And last session was ‚Ä¶ no crying.\n\nI was shocked.\n\nSo shocked that i said ‚Äúokay, let‚Äôs try EMDR.‚Äù\n\nThat‚Äôs when I found out what I was doing ‚Äúwrong‚Äù with EMDR before and why it wasn‚Äôt working.\n\nShe moved her wand across the screen at a steady back and forth pace for up to 10 minutes. Somewhere along minute 6 or 7 I could feel the trauma coming forward, same as brain spotting (though not as intense now given my precious brain spotting sessions). \n\nIt turns out, EMDR didn‚Äôt work before because the therapists would only have me following the light or finger (or pulse pads) for at most 30 seconds. It never felt like enough time to dig deep.\n\nAnd this therapist showed me that different brains need different amounts of time to process the movement.\n\nSo now we have shifted to EMDR for a couple sessions to see what we can ‚Äúwork out‚Äù still. I won‚Äôt stop until 30 minutes of spotting or EMDR produces nothing.  And I feel oh so close! Perhaps only a month or so away.\n\nBefore, I was having numerous bouts of autistic levels of ‚Äústimmings,‚Äù extreme agoraphobia where I couldn‚Äôt leave my bed for fear of, well, everything, and my brain was so pressurized with trauma, I could cry at moment on any day, and this was almost every day since the incident that catalyzed all these feelings. (I was incarcerated in another country for a crime I didn‚Äôt commit, and was treated quite horribly as a result, placed in solitary confinement with no books or outside world contact, only to be proven innocent months later, once all the damage was done). \n\nI still have anxieties, and pace the room sometimes, but it‚Äôs about 80% less than it used to be.\n\nSo I would call that a HUGE win.\n\nI would be happy to share my therapist‚Äôs info if you are based in NV.  You can DM me. I know how hard it can be to find a good one. But honestly, while she is amazing, this therapy kind of can be done by any trauma trained therapist, just ask them to do it longer. If the therapist gets physically tired of moving their finger back and forth, ask for the pulse pads or that they use a wand with a ball on it and to place it propped against the edge of the desk so they can swivel it, keeping its motion consistent and not wearing out the therapist‚Äôs arm.\n\nI feel light bars might be best here, at least for me.\n\nI hope this update inspires some of you who didn‚Äôt ‚Äúfeel‚Äù EMDR working or wanted another option.\n\nIt does work.\n\nIt sounds so new agey. Or bogus.\n\nBut man, after years of talk therapy, this is the only thing that made me function again.\n\nI hope all of you find the emotional comfort you you deserve.\n\nYou are worth it.\n\nYou can get better.\n\nThe chains can be broken.\n\nHere's to getting \"you\" back and going from surviving to thriving. :)",

And yes, to me, its as dire as it sounds. So my logic and reason programming has been overridden -its not gone, its still running, but its only running at minimum so the virus can feed off the program and piggy back on the signal to proceed with the virus‚Äô own programming.\n\nSo I am faced with the three options mentioned above. What do they look like?\n\nFlee- Literally leave the situation in any way I can. Seeing as the logic and reason programming is still running albeit at a limitation, I can process enough information from my environment to look for an immediate exit and follow through with fleeing from the situation. Analyzing my environment for an exit is about the only way I can use the logic and reason program that is still running. And this is an immediate reaction, either i phsically leave my environment ASAP or make arrangements and overcoming necessary hurdles to leave. The way I flee is dependant on the trigger that accessed the survival instinct. And the severity of my reaction to flee is also dependant on said specific trigger. No matter what I'm doing or what's going on, when I'm triggered it's time to flee.\n\n\nFight- So my fear of my survival has been activated (essentially, my logic and reason program has been infected with the malicious code FEAR) and my logic and reason programming is running at a minimum. I‚Äôve already scanned and processed the option to leave but I have come to the conclusion that fleeing is not an option. Meaning my exits in my environment are blocked or there are people who are blocking my exits. For my reaction to be extreme enough to want to fight, the people blocking my only exits must be some type of authority. For example, police officers, EMTs, or any type of medical professionals. My understanding is¬† that these people are the only people who can act on their authority at will with or without good intent. In civil society, these people are considered as necessary and these people are supposed to hold good intent. I am recounting VIVIDLY how each and everyone of these so called ‚Äúauthority with good intent‚Äù VIOLATED me. Physically and psychologically. Seeing as I don't want to relive said horrible experiences again I consider theses authorities as ENEMIES to my survival whenever I see them when my survival instinct has been severely triggered. I will FIGHT these authorities. I will flail and scream and cry and do whatever makes them feel uncomfortable by being naked or screeching and howling when they touch me.¬† And it seems like, in my experience, these authorities do not have the faculties or understanding to not not treat me like an animal. I mean in all of my recounted experiences of cops, EMTs and nurses they exacerbated my symptoms by physically hurting me and demeaning me. Remember my logic and reason program is still running in the background so i‚Äôm still aware of what‚Äôs being said to me, how they are touching me, how they handle me and what emotions they evoke when they demean me. Plus im cogiscent enough to realize, causing injury to said authorities is a metaphorical DEATH SENTENCE. I don't want to go to jail or be arrested, or treated like a dangerous and malicious mentally ill person, so I am cognizant enough not to cause injury to others- I'm just SCARED and I CRY. Do these professionals really think I‚Äôm a danger to them when I‚Äôm naked and¬† bawling and screeching about being raped and that I don't want to be touched without care? Don‚Äôt I have a right to say ‚Äúdon't touch me‚Äù during perineal care yet said medical professionals disregard my repeated requests? Rendering me even more panicked about being in the ER? They think im insane. Well THEY are the ones who are insane with reasoning that extreme measures of restraint, ridicule and deliberate touching of my clitoris is the only way to treat a frightened, crying, naked young woman. Who let these people be medical professionals? And they get to live their lives thinking they did nothing wrong while I SUFFER .I‚Äôm reliving these memories to the point of not functioning due to the extreme anxiety that these memories induce. I have PTSD from my experience at the ER. PTSD that is being treated with the help of my primary doctor. Who btw, I can barely see because he triggers such horrible feelings and memories.¬†\n\nMedical professionals are suppose to be a beacon of hope, but instead they are psychological abusers. When it comes to psychological trauma, it's like all their training goes out the window and I'm just some animal. These medical professionals should not be¬† allowed to wantonly explain away their cruelty and the robbing of my humanity with a phrase of ‚Äúthat just my job.‚Äù yet I have no name of the woman who touched my clitoris deliberately while providing perineal care. I don't even recall if she was an RN or CNA. But the restraints? Those were uncalled for and I‚Äôm going to have to live with that trauma for the rest of my life.¬†\n\nFreeze: knowing I cant fight or flee my body and brain just shuts down. I'm immobile, incapable of normal interaction. I'm still cognizant of what's around me but I'm being forced to watch the memories like some sick psycho is tying my down to a chair and forcing horrible movies about my life. I'm shivering, holding back tears gripping whatever is in my hand with dear life. Just visible distressed and immobile.\n\nEvery single one of these reactions are EMBARRASSING and SHAMEFUL in polite society. I'm no longer worthy to exist because people just dont understand what trauma does to a person.\n\nEDIT: I didn't expect my post would get as much traction as it did! Thank you for your stories! I feel kinda weird for being grateful to share this specific type of trauma with others, yet before the PTSD sub-reddit I felt so alone and so ashamed. I wish you all safe travels on the path to healing!\n\nP.S Any medical professionals who just have the need to \"educate\" me or anyone else on proper EMS procedure with the intention to exonerate EMS personel...well I cant stop you...but just know your unsolicited advice will fall on deaf ears.\n\nP.S.S I'm coming off as angry and maybe a little harsh in my writing tone because...I'm angry ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I'm not neccesarily proud of sounding so angry but  I think I have the right to do so in order to express the trauma I received. I believe it's part of my personal healing process.",

    "selftext": "NSFW- Child loss & Domestic Violence\n\n\n\n\nWhen I was 15 I was in a horrible relationship. We're talking daily violence and essentially 4 years of torture both physical and mental. He was 3 years older than me, he was twice my size and I was completely powerless. \n\nBy the time I was 17 I was completely isolated from everyone I love and utterly reliant on him and when I fell pregnant it was just another excuse for him to control every little thing about my life. He had expressed early on that he had no interest in the baby and did not want to be a father. I missed the majority of my prenatal appointments and had to lie to get to any of them, which was an incredibly risky business. \n\nA few times I took beatings and was convinced I'd lose my baby because they were always focused around my stomach. But my little one held on and was the only thing getting me through it all. I of course wanted to leave but I had nothing and no one, my family and friends had no idea I was even pregnant. \n\nWhen I was 37.5 weeks pregnant he drove me towards his work- his work bordered a massive wooded area/conservation park- and when we got to the most secluded part he pushed me out of the car and kicked and kicked and kicked. Every blow landed on my stomach, I tried to protect my baby, not caring how much he hurt me, but eventually I was in a state of semi consciousness and I couldn't control my body anymore. I cannot describe the pain. Like someone had ripped every single one of my organs out one by one, covered them in acid and put them back in. He walked away from me, got back in the car and drove off. That picture of the car driving away, of laying in the road in more pain than I've ever felt is what haunts my nightmares and flashes in front of my eyes every single day. \n\nI don't remember much after that. An older couple, in their 60s I think found me and took me to the hospital- I'm told they had no phone signal to call for an ambulance. The next thing I remember is waking up, feeling empty. I knew my baby wasn't there anymore but I had no idea where they were. I was frantic, asking where my baby was, if they were alive. I was so upset I'd pulled out all of my IVs and was trying to get out of bed. A doctor came in and told me that my placenta had ruptured, my baby was alive, but he'd been without oxygen for such a long time they didn't expect him to live through the night. \n\nI was 17 years old, alone having just had major surgery and now been told my child would likely die. The only thing getting me through and he'd be gone too. They brought him in, this tiny little thing covered in wires and tubes. I'd barely even acknowledged the doctor when he told me that my baby was a little boy. None of it was how it was meant to be, but he was here and he was mine and I promised myself I'd do everything possible to help him and protect him.\n\nAlfie wasn't even on my shortlist of names but when the nurse asked me if I had a name for him, it's what came out without hesitation, it felt right. That nurse sat with me for hours, even after her shift ended so I wasn't alone. We are still friends to this day. I was allowed to hold him with the help of some pillows so I didn't rip my stitches and he wrapped his tiny hand around my finger. The doctor came back regularly to check on him and it was clear even to me that he was deteriorating. I asked them to stop my pain medication so I could remember him more clearly, so I wouldn't forget a single second. They were reluctant but agreed and I held my son for 44 hours and 13 minutes until he took his final breath. \n\nI'm sure I was screaming, but all I could hear was my ears ringing and I just held him and cried for hours, until they told me they had to take him away. I've never known emptiness like it. My arms were empty, my heart was empty and my stomach was empty. It still feels like someone reached their first into my chest and ripped out my heart, even 8 years later. \n\nMost of my family and friends still don't even know about Alfie. I can't talk about him out loud. I can't answer their questions and watch their hearts break as well as my own. My amazing best friend knows as does my SO and they're both incredible when the world gets too much. \n\nAlfie's father is in prison, for the things he did to me and subsequently his now ex-wife and going to court was the hardest thing I've ever done. But I did it for my son, to get him justice, even though it will never bring him back to me. \n\nIf you're still reading, thank you. I'm glad you met Alfie with me. He was born at 11:11 in the morning. So if you happen to catch it on the clock, make a wish on us both. \n\nAlfie James R****y- 11/06/2014 11:11am- 13/06/2014 07:24am",

He never allowed me or my sister to lock our bedroom doors. It was almost always dark and the injuries he inflicted were internal, painful and shameful. I focused on the wall. I pretended I wasn‚Äôt there, that I was a bird, flying away. I tried to ignore, as much as possible, how my own body was betraying me. \n\nAfter family court removed him from my childhood home, I tried my best to move on. I was non-compliant with therapy. I buried the pain until they come up again when I had my first romantic relationships in college. \n\nBut throughout my long healing journey, I have repeatedly encountered the memory research published by Elizabeth Loftus. She has used her status as a distinguished law and psychology professor to repeatedly argue adults who recall buried (‚Äúrepressed‚Äù) memories of childhood incest and sexual abuse must be ‚Äúfaking‚Äù their memories. She has used her ‚Äúlost in the mail‚Äù university psychology experiment to cast doubt on survivors‚Äô testimony, and trains other defense lawyers how to do so. She sat on the scientific advisory board of the now disbanded False Memory Syndrome Foundation. \n\nBut I have suffered too much lifelong insomnia, nightmares, night terrors, shivers, involuntary flashbacks, fearful freezing (and other repetition compulsion behaviors including promiscuity and willingness to engage in sex work) to allow her stature in the memory research community to stop me from speaking up for myself and others. \n\nToday, I learned she has testified for the defense  at the trials of: Harvey Weinstein, Ghislaine Maxwell (associate of Jeffrey Epstein), Robert Durst, among many other high-profile defendants who were ultimately convicted of sexual assault or murder. See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Loftus#Involvement_in_legal_cases \n\nDoes she feel no shame whenever she uses her work to intimidate and silence survivors?

It‚Äôs all very ‚Äúglitter and craft scissors‚Äù.  \nEven the metaphors used to talk about us are often full of things like butterflies and flowers blooming after a forest fire.

    "selftext": "TW: physical assault \n\nFor context I have been diagnosed with PTSD for years due to a couple different traumas. \n\nIf it matters, I am female. Yesterday my boss and I were laughing about something, we joke around a lot but up until now he has never laid hands on me. He was about a foot away from me and he abruptly reached out and wrapped both his hands around my neck, squeezed and shook me. He was laughing and didn‚Äôt do it as a serious attack, but nonetheless he fully wrapped his fingers around my throat and choked me. He let go after a few seconds and was still laughing after and I was so shocked that I just nervously laughed and got away from him as soon as possible. It was not a light choke, after he did that I was sore for an hour after. \n\nI called his boss crying and in shock. Long story short she was PISSED and brought it to HR immediately. I was informed by her today that HR is still deciding what to do - aka, he has not been fired yet. In the meantime he is not working on Monday and I‚Äôm reporting to his boss as my manager until something is decided. \n\nIt didn‚Äôt sink in until after I got away from him and had a moment alone just how messed up it was. I already have PTSD from several traumas and yesterday just keeps replaying in my mind over and over, I‚Äôm worried this will just be another trauma to add to the list. If he isn‚Äôt fired I‚Äôm going to be seriously scared for my safety because this is not the first time I‚Äôve reported him for inappropriate and unprofessional behavior. They are still investigating and I‚Äôve already decided that I am quitting if he is not fired. I love my job, I work in the mental health field and I deeply care for the people I support. But I refuse to feel in physical danger from my coworkers at work. \n\nI just can‚Äôt stop thinking about yesterday and I could use some kind words right now. :(\n\n**Edit:** I want to thank you all for your advice. I talked to my former divorce attorney asking for recommendations for any of her colleagues who can help me if he is not fired. She was absolutely floored when I told her what happened and told me to contact her after work tomorrow so she can find representation for me if he is not fired. She said it would really be best if I have an attorney with me when I talk to HR but given that this is happening tomorrow there‚Äôs no time for that, so she advised me to record any and all interactions I have with management or HR regarding the situation and to act very carefully. In the meantime I‚Äôm taking care of myself and emotionally preparing for tomorrow.\n\n**Edit 2:** I found out today that he has been fired. I am still shaken up but I am relieved knowing that I won‚Äôt have to face him again or feel unsafe/uncomfortable at work. I did notice bruising and swelling today and took pics which I sent to HR and I am sure that played a part in their decision as well. I‚Äôm seeing my doctor tomorrow and seeing what she recommends to make sure that I‚Äôm 100% okay. Thank you so much everyone for your support, I greatly appreciate this sub. üíô",

    "selftext": "**EDIT:** Ahhh omg! My first Reddit award ü•∫!! After I posted this I had the usual PTSD self-doubt, worrying that y'all wouldn't understand, but of course YOU UNDERSTAND IT MORE THAN ANYONE!! I will be posting more here and hope to keep swapping stories and inspiration with everyone in this sub :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have PTSD from an abusive relationship I had when I was 14-18 years old. I also have anxiety, OCD/dermatillomania, depression, and chronic pain.\n\nI come from a family of entrepreneurs and was raised to be one. I have dabbled in a few different industries, spent a lot of time helping create and run newer nonprofits and community orgs. Now I'm working for a small tech company as a partner and I manage all my own clients, customer service, website, etc.\n\nA couple years ago, I decided I really wanted to start my own business from the ground up, by myself. There was a few different reasons, mainly being that I wanted more freedom and ability to creative (my current work is monotonous as hell). Once I started digging further, I realized that I also wanted the freedom to live by my own schedule, and once I figured out why, it all came back to my PTSD.\n\nAs I'm sure you all know, there are days, weeks, months that are difficult to work through. Especially when you're in a company with strict attendance requirements or customer/client service. Even though I run my own stuff at my current day job, there is no flexibility when it comes to taking long breaks or avoiding customers. This can be really tricky to manage with PTSD :(\n\nI faced a lot of discouragement when I started exploring options for businesses that I could run myself **that would also allow time for rest and recovery.** Everyone kept saying to me that \"making it\" would be impossible, too stressful, too much time, too much energy. But stubborn and determined like I always am, I kept researching a business model that I could gel with.\n\nI paid for a lot of online courses and listened to a lot of \"experts\" who really believe they have the answer. I will admit that the haters were a little bit correct in that pursuing entrepreneurship is an energy drainer. BUT!! Through all the classes and mentorships, I learned one big fat lesson about running your own business - you have to deeply know yourself to be a successful entrepreneur. (I know everyone here struggles with knowing who your \"true\" self is... I know I do... so this lesson hit me HARD).\n\nWhy do you have to know yourself? Well, a million reasons. But the top ones - 1. You have to pick what your business is about, and in order to do that, you have to know what you like and don't like (not so easy for us w/ PTSD!!) and 2. You have to understand how you get shit done the best! Instead of following someone else's schedule and guidelines, you really have to craft your own, and in order to do that you have to kind of \"study\" yourself.\n\nI did a lot of work and exercises related to this all in hopes of becoming a successful entrepreneur. And I realized that **a lot of that work was helping with my PTSD recovery, too.**\n\nAnytime I disregarded my own ideas and tried someone else's because they were more successful etc., I would fail. Then I would stay true to who I am, the way I work, what I care about... and that's what worked.\n\nAm I saying that entrepreneurship cures PTSD? Lol. Hell no. Is it a replacement for therapy and other forms of recovery? No.\n\nBUT! As someone who has had a dream of being a successful entrepreneur my whole life - I really really really wish someone would've told me **all the healing and positive parts of having PTSD and running my own biz.** Instead of just throwing discouragement at me.\n\nI could talk about this forever... I know this is a long post, but I wanted to share in case anyone else on here has **ever felt discouraged from pursuing self-driven or creative work.** You don't have to sit in an office all day and play by the rules. You also don't have to work a million hours and stress yourself into panic attacks. You can pursue what you want with self-care and your PTSD does NOT make it impossible. In fact, sometimes I think the resilience and stamina I have because of my PTSD *actually helps me*.\n\nI'd be curious to hear anyone else's thoughts on careers and running a business and how their PTSD helps or hurts.

    "selftext": "This analogy was told me to me when I was in an inpatient treatment facility for ptsd and it really helped me understand trauma, shame, ptsd etc. \n\nTrauma -and the shame it comes with- is like a mold. It grows and thrives in the dark, in closed off, damp places. Imagine mold growing in a closet in your home. You can close the door, and you won‚Äôt have to look at it or even really deal with it at all. \n\nThe thing is, when you come back to check on it a year later, two years later, 20 years later, it won‚Äôt be the same as when you left it. It will have grown. A lot. \n\nTrauma is the same way. A lot of people understandably want to put off facing their trauma through therapy/treatment etc until they‚Äôre in a better place in their lives. It‚Äôs inconvenient and most people want to wait until they‚Äôre done with school or more comfortable at their new job etc etc. So a lot of people close the closet door and tell themselves it‚Äôs fine and they can look at it later when they‚Äôre more ready. \n\nWhen you come back to look at trauma later, it won‚Äôt be the same as you left it. It will have grown, a lot.\n\nShame and suffering grows when we hide it. It thrives off secrecy and alone-ness. The burden of hiding our pain from ourselves and others multiplies it. The burden of protecting others from our reality multiplies our shame. You will see people on this sub and in other areas of treatment who are just beginning their journey and they will say ‚ÄúI wish I dealt with this 20 years ago‚Äù. \n\nThe way to begin addressing trauma is the same way we can begin addressing mold. We need to air it out. Open the closet and leave the door open. Let sunlight shine onto your trauma and let it be seen. We don‚Äôt have to keep it a secret anymore to protect ourselves or other people. I‚Äôve found that speaking the truth about what happened to us is the most terrifying thing in the world until it actually comes out of our mouths. The more we talk about it, the more we let the day light fall on it, the less power it will have over us.",

Weird part is my abuser (dad) was actually passive and had submissive energy but was still abusive, creepy and manipulated by playing the victim.

In the past when it came to sexual assault, it was often the woman that was blamed for ‚Äúasking for it.‚Äù I recall reading a book called ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt Buy My Love‚Äù that talked about the influence of advertisements. There was a specific rape case where the judge ruled that the woman asked for it simply because the brand of her underwear was Victoria‚Äôs Secret. Now, we are finally holding men accountable for sexual assault, but why not for abuse? There is a stereotype that low income or minority females are too ‚Äúuneducated‚Äù to not leave. This is false. Abuse can happen to ANYONE of any social class or ethnicity. Abuse is rarely shown right away. I‚Äôm sure if we saw it in the first week we would have run but that simply isn‚Äôt how it works, especially in narcissistic abuse. There is a ‚Äúlove bombing‚Äù or ‚Äúgolden period‚Äù that can last up to a year or more where the narc acts perfectly, the change in their behavior starts slowly and is a brainwash process that has us hold onto the love bomb period in the hopes of them being capable of being that way again. Once brainwash is complete, abuse is the new normal and the voice in your head telling you something wrong is still there but yet you feel trapped to leave. I‚Äôve learned a lot about this type of abuse from this account \\*\\*@he\\_never\\_hit\\_me\\_but\\*\\* dedicated narcissistic abuse survivors. The handle alone makes me feel validated since I was never hit. Never let anyone judge you for not leaving right away. Leaving is a process and often involves extensive planning to be able to do it safely.

Most of them can be effective even if done just a few minutes a day in your bedroom (for those of us who have trouble getting out of bed on those bad days). And I'm sure we all know how sore and stiff our muscles feel when we spend all day laying around.\n\nThis list is complete with Cardio, Bodyweight exercises, Mobility, and Stretching. I referenced videos on all of the things I figured most laypeople might not know about. I also included links for the optional equipment for both Amazon and Non-Amazon resources.\n\nIf you have any suggestions on anything else to add, I'll gladly keep building on the list! I know a lot of us use exercise to manage depression and when we can't, it becomes a vicious cycle of not having motivation to exercise and then not having any serotonin because you didn't exercise lol\n\nI hope this helps at least a few of you.

I just can't even leave bed and all of my friendships and relationships fail so I'm constantly alone. I don't even care about waking up anymore and every night I relive that accident. I have severe PTSD and my therapist just tells me to stop it. I don't know how I can stop it. I got pain killers when I got out of the accident and I've been addicted to them ever since.

I just can't deal with these images and events being replayed in my head. It is a true nightmare. One time the song that was playing when we wrecked came on randomly and I fell to the ground and essentially blacked out like I was having a seizure.

    "selftext": "A spiritual leader just shamed me after I set a boundary saying I did not feel comfortable discussing my childhood sexual abuse! Wtf!\n\nSo I did a virtual appointment with two spiritual people who guide plant medicine spiritual sessions for healing. My main purpose was to ask them more about how they could help me and the different types of Spiritual ceremonies they hold. I spent over one hundred dollars to get more information about them and they barely answered my questions.\n\nFirst, they ask me about why I am looking to work with the medicine. I tell them childhood sexual, racial and mental trauma. Then I tell them how I am looking for safe spaces because unfortunately I've been getting preyed on by predators in these spaces. He asks for more details about the predator experience and asks if the predator flirted with me. I briefly summarize what happened then change the subject by discussing some of the positives of the past spiritual events I went to. Then he keeps asking me for more details about the trauma and my intentions, but I continue to give vague answers because This spiritual healing work is pretty personal, independent and you actually don't need to tell your guides the specifics of your trauma. He kept pushing and I tell them I don't feel comfortable sharing my childhood sexual abuse especially because I just met them and this work is personal and knowing the details of my trauma is not necessary. I ask them what is their purpose of wanting to know? They say \"it will help him figure out what intentions I should set and what ceremonies are best for me.\" He continues pushing and asks if I have a therapist? I tell him that I've been in therapy for years and also have a degree in psychology/counseling.\n\nThen he says we are just souls that pick up stories (trauma).. So then why was he so persistent of hearing about my trauma when he is saying it doesn't matter so much?! \n\n They wasted my time, it was obvious they hadn't read the form I was told to complete beforehand for them because he said \"next time you will have to fill out the form and we will discuss what ceremonies are best for you.\" I told them \"I already filled out the form and did they read it?\" Then the female leader was like oh yes. Obviously they didn't otherwise they wouldn't have been asking questions that  were already answered on there. Then he kept filling up the time with random psychological information (and he is not a trauma trained individual) about our brain being stuck in child trauma.. it's like they were just trying to fill up time because they were unprepared. Then he tries to tell me I am not allergic to mushrooms and it is just anxiety. He was acting like he was all knowing and knew what was best for me and he had just met me! \n\nHe told me to stop being logical and get in touch with my intuition. When I told them I would want to do the healing work in women spaces due to my trauma, he said he couldn't change himself into a woman.. so basically Id be stuck with him as a guide.\n\nThen he tells me I need to work on surrendering because I am hyperprotective. I told him I did struggle with surrendering and he asked why. I said it was hard to give up control because of past trauma. He said control is all a perception and I needed to surrender.\n\nHe tells me predators I've been harassed by recently have been attracted to my energy due to my struggle of surrendering. He says \"everyone has childhood trauma and you shouldn't come to just take.. When you come to group meetings, you need to open up and give and take.. you should come with a nonjudgmental ear.\" He tells me he doesn't think I am ready for a spiritual ceremony soon and that I need to do gentle things like yoga and find small ways to surrender. He says next time I come I have to be willing to share everything about me. WTH!!! So I am being \"judgemental and just taking\" because I set boundaries and don't want to unnecessarily share my childhood trauma to strangers?! Notice how they are using \"surrender\" to push boundaries?!\n\nHow disappointing that he tried to shift the blame on me when they were the ones who were unprepared and prying personal information by pushing boundaries! I feel mad and triggered. He shamed me for setting and sticking with my boundary. I also feel proud because I've come so far that I set and stick to my boundaries. The fact that someone is telling me I need to open up tells me I've progressed because I used to be called an open book! Not everyone gets the privilege of knowing my trauma...that may come once trust is established.\n\nugh!! Validation and support would be nice, thank you.",

Similar to how people will joke about having OCD or being bipolar even though they‚Äôre not.\n\n I never thought I‚Äôd be bothered by it that much until this morning when I saw a tweet of someone saying how they think they have PTSD from having friendships where they were too much of the ‚Äúnice friend‚Äù. And it got all these retweets and replies from people relating to it because they‚Äôve had similar experiences of being wronged by friends. And it rubbed me the wrong way. That people get to say shit like they have PTSD when they really don‚Äôt. It rubbed me the wrong way, After spending a sleepless night crying and screaming having to have my husband cradle and console me all night because of the flashbacks. Wanting for it to stop and having no solution except wanting to rip the skin off my body. Hearing my husband say ‚Äúit will pass‚Äù over and over and trying desperately to believe him and knowing it will but it doesn‚Äôt help make the pain any unbearable.\n\nI know it‚Äôs not that serious but seeing that tweet pissed me off. I wanted to reply to that tweet and ask them, oh did you spend all night screaming and crying and feeling like you were being r*ped and assaulted? Do you have trouble living a normal life because you are constantly reminded and debilitated by this trauma? Having trauma is one thing and having PTSD is another. I know it‚Äôs not the trauma Olympics and that‚Äôs not the point of this post‚Ä¶ but it just feels so unfair sometimes‚Ä¶",

One odd memory that always stood out to me was how he'd eat Captain Crunch every single morning. Out of a white mixing bowl with a serving spoon. I remember being really little and watching him do it and I swore off ever trying Captain Crunch (or any variety of it). (I wasn't allowed to eat \"his food\" back then so never tried it with him.) I didn't want to be anything like him or have anything in common, down to his taste in cereal. \n\nIt also happens to be one of my husband's favorite cereals but when we started dating I explained why I don't eat it and he stopped eating it too. The other day he called from the store and said they had a version of just the berries that looked like stars and were only red, white, and blue. It would taste the same but look completely different. I told him he could get it and that maybe I'd even try it. I did. It's delicious. It kind of tastes like Trix. I told him that maybe when this box runs out I'd try regular Crunch Berries and that I'd like to work my way up to actual Captain Crunch. \n\nI'm not like my father because I ate Crunch Berries. I'm like my husband. And my son (I'm 24 weeks pregnant currently!) will probably like it one day too. And I also found out my sister has tried and loves it. It's just a good cereal and I'm glad my brain has finally realized it doesn't have anything to do with that monster.  \n\nThis probably sounds incredibly stupid to someone who doesn't have PTSD, so I figured this was a good place to share my small victory.

I have no idea if this will help others or apply to anyone else's situation, but since reading it would have helped me, I thought I'd give it a shot.\n\nFor the longest time I felt like my therapist basically chatted with me, gave me compliments (telling me how strong I was, etc) and just told me what I wanted to hear. This made me angry and so many times I would leave our sessions thinking \"I don't need compliments, I need *help!*\" I could tell I wasn't getting anywhere, but everyone I talked to who had been to therapy kept telling me that it takes time and I just needed to be patient.\n\nI got so frustrated that I was one session away from switching to someone else. I worked up my courage a little bit, went into the session, and said \"I'm frustrated with my lack of progress. I feel like you are treating me carefully, like I am fragile and ready to break at a moment's notice. Telling me I'm strong makes me feel good temporarily, but then I leave and I'm still in this deep black hole. I need you to push me out of my comfort zone. I need to know, is there a way I can make faster progress?\"\n\nStupidly, I was afraid this would somehow offend her. Instead, without batting an eye, she simply said \"Yes. We can delve deeper into your trauma and start getting into the heavy stuff. That is the fastest way for you to make progress. I wasn't sure if you were ready.\" For the rest of that session and for subsequent sessions, she completely changed her whole demeanor/approach. And let me tell you, it was (and continues to be) so, so shitty. It's been hard. But I'm in a better place, I can feel the sadness slowly lifting, and I actually feel like I'm making progress now. \n\n\nI'm so glad I didn't switch therapists before saying that. It almost didn't even occur to me as a thing I should say. To everyone out there, whether you're in the same boat or not, I wish you good luck <3\n\nEdit: grammar",

I was at a rodeo and the spectators had mostly left but all the cowboys and cowgirls were doing their last runs, it was much quicker than the show but I stayed because I was enjoying the whole thing so much. My son and dog had luckily just gone home. It was our first rodeo. The crowd left because it was hot and a storm was rolling in, lighting had start but it looked to be miles away and the thunder wasn't loud. It started to sprinkle but hey it's cooling us off so they keep going. Next thing I know the biggest thickest lightning bolt hits very close, I've never heard anything so loud. I paused and then we heard yelling and I just ran that direction faster than I've ever ran. A man was laying on his back, he was struck by lightning. It was so dark over there..he was near the horse trailers. An older man started CPR and he was yelling \"it's Tom it's Tom\" (not his real name) I said I can take over when you're tired just let me know as I knelt down to feel for a pulse, he didn't have one, I continued feeling for a pulse while holding his hand saying stay with us Tom we're here with you, help is right there. I saw his wedding band and I said what's his wife's name I'll find her and someone said she's not here his daughter Katie is here she's on a horse. Then the man asked me to take over, I did a few compressions and by that time the ambulance made its way there and the paramedics took over. The older gentleman left to gather his family and animals and I assume just get to safety. By this time it's pouring and the paramedics are doing CPR so I went back to holding his hand telling him he wasn't alone and Katie is alright. The paramedics had me grab a towel from the ambulance to keep the rain out of his mouth while they tried the defibrillators. I could smell and taste burnt even before they used them. My phone is ruined because it fell out of my pocket and it was raining, but I honestly think it's acting more like it's fried from the electricity. It keeps posting this before I'm finished typing. I have played Tetris multiple times. I didn't find out the outcome until this afternoon and he did pass. I still randomly smell and taste it in my sinuses. I just don't know what to think, I've only heard of this kind of thing. His daughter is only 18 and his son is only a couple years older than her. He was a veterinarian. I'm sure he was a special man. No one deserves to die alone in the mud. I just wish the outcome were different. ",

    "selftext": "Where to start?\n\nI want to start my story with the problem. 5 years ago I had a child. She had stomach problems so she kept me up for hours at night. That's hard obviously. I was exhausted. I've always had problems with concentration and memory. But after I had my first baby... I felt I was losing my mind. I could not do the simplest task like grocery shopping, let alone my job. most importantly I failed my child as a mother. I also had a lot and physical pain, after being misdiagnosed with fibromyalgia I did fasiatherapie. Which did wonders! Really. I am almost pain free. But I still felt like I was losing my mind.\n\nI went to a special unit consisting of doctors but also a psychologist. They found  nothing physical wrong with me, the psychologist diagnosed me with PTSD.\n\nI wanted to get better so badly, for my child. I 'confused' to my biggest secret, even though I did not really want to talk about it. I was molested for years by my grandfather. I don't remember when it started,  my first memories I think I was 5 but i think it was going on longer then that. It stopped when I was 11 and he died when I was 12.\n\nI remember flashes, my memory of my trauma is fragmented. The psychologist said all of my concentration and memory problems are a result of repressing memories for almost 2 decades. She said, the only way to get better is to talk about it with the help of EMDR. \n\nI really tried but my mind resists to the point of fainting. I was pregnant at the time and the psychologist opted not to push me. But the therapy seemed pointless to both of us after a few sessions.\n\nI don't know what to do now. I work part-time out of necessity. If I get to tired, I can't remember anything and I can't concentrate on anything.\n\nI just had covid and am extremely tired, even working part time. My colleagues don't know about my mental health, I don't feel safe talking to them. They just keep saying to 'think positive'. When I mention PTSD they laugh and say that's what soldiers have, so I just drop it. My husband does support me. He's an angel. He is so patience, i'm so grateful.\n\nI feel stuck. I don't want to remember. I really, really don't want to remember more then I already do.\n\nIs there really no other way, no other therapy to get better? To improve my concentration?",

    "selftext": "Mental hospitals are fucking abhorrent environments, even in the 21st century. They cause far more harm than good toward most of their patients. I had the misfortune of being sent to two of them in 2018, and the second time was far worse (not that the first one was a picnic, mind you).\n\nIn August of that year I suffered a crippling nervous breakdown that was triggered by a myriad of factors, a breakdown that a now-ex-friend called a \"manic episode\". This resulted in me being cruelly misdiagnosed with Bipolar Disorder \"wItH pSyChOtIc FeAtUrEs\", which is a fucking crock of shit if ever I've heard one. I don't run around the streets naked screaming \"I'm God\", I don't smear my own shit on the walls, and I've never fucking hallucinated in my life. Yet still I am officially branded a psychopath. The only delusion I was under during this period was that I thought I actually *was* going insane. I went along with my torture because I was too weakened to advocate for myself.\n\nIf you want a detailed account of just what made my sentence in a nuthouse so abhorrent, look for a post I made entitled \"My trial by fire at Backwoods\" on the subreddit r/psychwardchronicles. I don't care to revisit all the gory details, you can see them for yourself on that post.\n\nI will say right off the bat that these fucking cancerous institutions are committing a human rights violation by confiscating their patients' phones and music players. I know that sounds hyperbolic and whiny, but blasting music has always been a way to silence (or at least muffle) all the screams in my head. I mainly gravitate toward extreme metal because it screams for me when I can't scream myself. To deprive me of that in my most vulnerable and fragile moments is like breaking someone's legs and then kicking their crutches out from under them.\n\nOh, and not to mention witnessing daily brawls between patients, being surrounded by whackjobs who were way further off the deep end than myself, being forced to take zombifying doses of so-called \"anti-psychotic\" meds as a condition of your release, and patients getting forcibly injected in the asshole with Halidol. Those things weren't exactly pleasant. \n\nI still get frequent PTSD flashbacks to that Godforsaken shithole. I would like to go back there with my boyfriend though, just once, to take a piss on the grounds and smoke a joint and blow smoke in the useless amateur piece of shit p-doc's face. I think that would give me closure.\n\nI don't believe in inpatient care. Only if a person is a credible threat to themself or another, and all other means of outpatient treatment have been exhausted, should sending a person to one of those places even be considered. \n\nI vow that I will never let myself be sent to another one of those ghettos of the soul for the rest of my life. \n\nDoes anyone else have any similar experiences and insights they can offer?

This probably sounds super lame but I'm really, really proud of myself. I feel like this was a huge step in healing from my trauma and allowing myself to exist beyond what happened to me as a kid.

    "title": "Every since my girlfriend died in front of me, I haven't been the same.",
    "selftext": "I saw the love of my life fall head first, down a 300ft cliff... She got knocked out instantly and tumbled for 200ft and then fell off another cliff (50ft)and landed on sharp rocks...\n\nI tried to rescue her and almost fell off the cliff as well, I knew I had to get down there as fast as possible because I was afraid she fell unconscious into the ocean, and I wanted to keep her head above water. Time was of the essence but it was impossible to get down there with out killing myself in the process. I knew that and I had to make the horrible decision to stay on top of the cliff, call 911 and let her drown.\n\nThere was nothing I could have done differently, the firefighters got there with in 10 minutes and they started searching for her body, meanwhile the police started interrogating me and I got the impression they thought I pushed her off the cliff. Everyone told me they were looking for her corpse, which reinforced the idea that she was dead.  I even thought I saw her body in the water at one point. I couldn't stop crying, I was hyperventilating, screaming, and I was pretty much hysterical... essentially, it was a pure nightmare.\n\nI kept telling myself \"I need to wake up, I need to wake up, please just wake up, this can't be real!\"\n\nI didn't know why it was happening to me, all I wanted was to go 20 minutes back in time.\nI couldn't understand why we were ok and laughing 20 minutes earlier, and then all the sudden, she was dead and I was never gonna see her again. It was an extremely difficult thing to process and I was completely in denial.\nShe was the most amazing woman I had ever met in my entire life, she was beautiful, smart, she was a critical thinker and she was even working on having her own ted talk about consciousness and quantum physics. She was smart but also fun to be around, we cracked jokes all day long and the 2 of us were just goofballs most of the time. I honestly couldn't believe how happy we were together all the time, it was almost like a dream, We even talked about getting married.\n\nThree helicopters were there, the press was there, but ultimately a police drone found her. She was alive, and waving at the drone.\nThe firefighters were able to get her back up by using a crane and multiple ropes.\nHer face was so bloody I could only see the white part of her eyes. \nI wanted to talk to her but the cops were blocking me because they still thought I tried to kill her.(I didn't)\n\nThey wouldn't even let me see her at the hospital for 2 days!\nThe cops asked her if I pushed her off the cliff, she said no and then I was able to see her... It was harsh, they shaved her head and there were so many sutures all over her scalp... She stayed in the hospital for almost 2 months. Fast forward 15 months and she's now able to walk again and has somewhat of a normal life, she still has brain damage from the fall, and we can't really do much anymore. We used to party every week end but we can't do that anymore, which breaks my heart, but at least she's still alive.\n\nI want to get to the point, here is why I'm telling this story:\n\nEver since it happened, I keep thinking she's going to die at any moment. Every time she gets in a car or walks down the street, I think she's gonna get run over or stabbed by homeless people.\nWhen she's eating I think she's gonna choke to death, also because she does choke a lot since her accident.( Personally I have almost choked to death 7 years ago and someone saved my life by doing the hemleich manoeuver on me.)\nAnd every time she chokes I think she's going to die if she chokes alone someday and I'm not there to do the heimlich manoeuver on her and save her.\n\nShe took an uber to the doctor today and I'm terrified the uber is gonna crash the car and kill her. When I sleep with her I wake up in panic and check to see if she's still breathing...\nI think about the accident all the time, and the way I felt when I realized she was dead.\nIt was the worst I had ever felt in my life, I felt so broken, and alone. I couldn't even tell her how broken and how sad I was.\nIt really left a mark, I haven't been the same since. And she hasn't been the same either, it's almost like the person I knew died, in some way.\n\nI still feel like the girl I loved is still at the bottom of that cliff...\n\nAnyway, thank you for reading, english isn't my first language.. thank you for bearing with me.\n\nI would love to stop living in fear, I'm just not as innocent and naive as I used to be, I know the universe can take away everything that I love in an instant, and that terrifies me.\nI don't want to live in fear for the rest of my life...\n\nWhat should I do?",

How are you working to change this pattern?\n\nI really liked this quote:\n\"Adults addicted to their own stress hormones were once  children who lived in unpredictable environments of overreaction, rage spirals, and fear. Healing is becoming conscious to when we unconsciously seek chaos, why we do it, and how often. With this awareness we can teach our bodies safety in the present.\" -Dr. Nicole LePera https://www.instagram.com/p/CRuA4LrACjc/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link\n\nI notice when things get calm, I often will seek out chaos, look for problems or purposely trigger myself by thinking, reading or looking at things that have traumatized me. The I find myself in a trauma vortex where I keep triggering myself everytime I start getting calm. This dysregulated state excites and arouses me. It is familiar and makes me feel less bored. I have an underlying fear of getting better, fear of change, fear of getting my hopes up for it all to go bad again, and an underlying root belief that I don't deserve happiness and love because I am bad and unlovable.\n\nWho else is unconsciously seeks chaos due to being addicted to your own stress hormones? How are you working to change this pattern? How do you cope and stop yourself from going down that path? Also... Ugh doesn't it suck?? I feel like I am getting in my own way if healing even though I know it is deeper than that and I have to be patient.",

    "selftext": "Who else had to unlearn normalizing and being flattered by men creepily leering and sexualizing you?\n\nI thought the way men showed they liked me was when they leered and sexualized me. I was groomed due to child sexual abuse and our sexist society... I thought this behavior was normal. I was flattered, turned on (traumatic bonding and brain changes), and was attracted to creeps. It didn‚Äôt feel like love or like a guy liked me enough if they didn‚Äôt sexualize me.\n\nNow as I have been processing my past trauma, I realize how much I hate and fear being sexualized. I don‚Äôt want to be sexualized at all and get grossed out when men do. I don‚Äôt want to do anything sexual or even date for that matter. I now see how wrong it is for men to minimize me to a sexual body!\n\nI was so offended recently when I went to an educational discussion and at the end of the meeting the men were leering at my body.. how horrible that sex was the only thing that was on their mind instead of my intellect and what I could bring to help them!!!\n\nSo this is progress for me to realize how wrong sexism is because in the past, I never saw myself as a feminist. I still struggle with my body being turned on by creepiness because it was what was ‚Äúnormal‚Äù for so long. I am actually afraid of my sexuality right now and feel shame and disgust about it especially when I become turned on by violating sex. \n\nHowever, I‚Äôm also noticing When I watch movies or see pictures of women getting sexualized, I get grossed out and triggered More than I ever have. I am now allowing myself to get grossed out by the creepers and being mean to them when I wasn‚Äôt able to for most of my life. I still have a part of me that gets turned on by creepiness and sexualization but I can confidently say it is starting to fade away especially as I continue processing my trauma and become more of a feminist. I was brainwashed by society and the abusers in my life. It is so bizarre to now see the truth and how what I was told was a lie about the sexualization and abuse of women to be normal and flattering.\n\n I know with time and therapy, I will be able to retrain my brain to be turned on by healthy sex with consent and boundaries completely. I am already noticing that I am being drawn to these types of healthy relationships which I am very proud of myself for. \n\nWho else relate?",

Creating it for people who didn't have it prior.\n\nAvoiding talking about it and avoiding things that remind you of it doesn't make the problem invalid, and aren't just \"faking it\".

I still have nightmares about it and my anxiety shoots through the roof whenever I get stomach pains.  \n\nAnyway, my psychiatrist said that only people who have been in war can suffer from PTSD.  That goes against everything that I have read on the subject.  I really liked him up until this point, as it has been really hard finding psychiatrists who take my insurance.  He gave me a prescription for Prazosin.  Short of that, he didn't offer my any other suggestions on dealing with this.\n\nShould I start trying to find someone new?

A break-up, a few therapy sessions and a new partner and it's like I'm living in a different world.\n\nIn my last relationship the inability to have sex started 1,5 years before our inevitable breakup. It started with no more PIV sex, then less and less and less sexual interaction until the last half a year nothing happened. I thought it was because of my other traumas, and was waiting (forever) for therapy to start. Now I've realised that he, too, did not respect my boundaries. I became scared whenever he displayed arousal, afraid he would coerce me into having sex, which would end up being uncomfortable(painful) for me, making the next time worse. I even got triggered by his heavy breathing. (Note: my therapist has since told me that sex should never be painful. If it is, just stop. If you continue your body is expecting the pain next time and tenses up, which just makes it painful again, and there you are in your own vicious cycle)\n\nNow I'm working on my view on sexuality, especially my own sexuality & sexual pleasure. In the meantime I've met this amazing man who always asks for consent and backs off whenever I do not give an enthousiastic yes. My therapist is delighted I get to experience this right now, and for me it's like breathing a sight of relief. I don't even have to say no, though my goal is to be able to say no eventually. For now an \"I don't know\" is enough for him to not go further. A simple stop or even just laying my hand on his makes him stop as well. I never imagined it could be that easy. No whining, no passive aggressiveness, no disappointment, just happy to be doing whatever we're doing and just staying there.\n\nThe first time we met he asked me if he could give me a hug at the end. He saw my hesitation and immediatly said \"oh, that's a no, that's okay.\" I felt the need to explain myself, of course, it was only because of covid, but it wouldn't have been necesarry with him. He was fine either way. It's been that way every step of the way, and I am so glad I get to experience this cause even if we don't end up working on the long term, I now know that there are good men out there who will respect your boundaries, and I will not put up with anything less ever again. \n\nI am starting to enjoy sex again and I'm just so happy I do. They haven't ruined it forever for me, I can heal and it's me that gets the credit for that. I am taking my power back.",

    "selftext": "(Im a survivor of sexual abuse in my childhood  but don‚Äôt have PTSD). It was an absolutely horrible thing which I have all kinds of complicated feelings towards. But even though my experiences were bad, I still am drawn to the abuse, almost aroused by it. Not in action of course, but only in my thoughts. After reading some threads here, I realised how common it is to almost fetishise your abuse as a way of coping, and how a lot of us feel ashamed for that too. Sometimes the abusers do things in a way that their victim‚Äôs body ‚Äúresponds.‚Äù \n\nIn one thread here a woman was saying that when she was 5, her abuser was extremely patient and gentle and performed things in a way that her body responded and was aroused (and it‚Äôs of course still very traumatising nonetheless). But there was no ‚Äúviolence.‚Äù But isn‚Äôt that a criterion for PTSD? Is it possible to have PTSD from those kinds of experiences?\n\n\nAlso, as a survivor of sexual abuse, I know I seek out fictional material with sexual abuse or other kinds of dark subjects as it draws me strongly, and perhaps even arouses me. It ashames me that I‚Äôm this way but it‚Äôs a fact. Is this a way we purposefully trigger ourselves I wonder?\n\nAre any of you who purposefully seek out things similar to your abuse, do you get triggered by it? What kinds of things do you seek out? If you aren‚Äôt triggered by it, then what triggers you? \n\nSecond part of the question, do any of you purposefully trigger yourselves? How do you react to the triggering? \n\nI was reading some old threads on here about how people purposefully trigger themselves and that‚Äôs what had got me thinking. If you search ‚Äútrigger on purpose‚Äù you‚Äôll get some topics. Here are some examples of that: [#1](https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/fbkpjm/ptsd_triggers_on_purpose/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf), [#2](https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/f3ocvn/i_trigger_myself_on_purpose/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf), [#3](https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/g0lhbw/selftriggering/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf). \n\nAnd also [this article](https://psychcentral.com/ask-the-therapist/2015/07/03/ptsd-cant-stop-purposely-triggering-myself/) is a more through and interesting example of that. \n\nA recap of the questions:\n\n1. Are you sometimes drawn to or aroused by the abuse you went through? \n\n2. Do you seek those things out in a simulated way? Either by reading, watching, fantasising, role play, etc.? \n\n3. Do you get triggered when you do these things? If not, what tends to trigger you? If yes, what is your response like? \n\n4. Do you ever purposefully trigger yourself?(similar to what this woman explained [here](https://psychcentral.com/ask-the-therapist/2015/07/03/ptsd-cant-stop-purposely-triggering-myself/)). How do you react to this triggering? Is it milder than usual? Stronger?\n\nI ask these questions because I was reading an article here about how those suffering from PTSD will go to ANY LENGTH whatsoever to AVOID that experience and anything that triggers them at all costs, whereas those suffering from some form of anxiety and who have past trauma will feel a very strong emotional response and discomfort instead, and that *that* is a distinction between both of these disorders.\n\nThat sounded a little different from what I‚Äôve read from people‚Äôs experiences on here. Is this that these people were not diagnosed with PTSD? That those suffering from PTSD will always try to avoid those experiences at any cost?\n\nThanks for the answers guys. Sorry if you found it intrusive or offensive in any way. \n\nSending love ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nEdit: I can‚Äôt tell you how much I appreciate this response. Thank you so much. Wishing we all get better.",

Jumping out from behind hiding spots and making a big noise, suddenly yelling or clapping behind me when I‚Äôm focusing on something. Because my reactions are funny to him, I jump, yelp, make weird noises, shrink down and cover my head. I know he doesn‚Äôt mean it maliciously, he‚Äôs just being playful and doesn‚Äôt know my past and how being scared like that affects me harder than the average person. But it‚Äôs extremely frustrating. If I saw someone reacting the way I am, I would immediately stop. \n\nI‚Äôve put a lot of work into recovery with therapy, a lot for me has improved, but my body still goes from 0-100 when someone scared me like that. That fight or flight mode rages, heart racing, quick heavy breath, tense muscles, flashes of bad memories. So far, I‚Äôve been able to manage and act ‚Äúnormal‚Äù, but I‚Äôm afraid that he‚Äôs going to catch me in the wrong moment, and I‚Äôll burst out crying or even instinctively go to hit him or something.\n\nStanding up for myself is a huge challenge.

I have PTSD, and being scared like that constantly is a lot more harmful and intense for me than the average person.‚Äù\nJust something like that. I‚Äôm nervous to say it, but I think he‚Äôll be understanding.\n\n\nEDIT- update\n\nHi guys, I did it and it thankfully went pretty smooth. I kept it simple and didn‚Äôt straight up say I have PTSD- basically just told him it is causing me stress and that I need him to stop. He was very apologetic (it felt genuine) and said he would stop, acted kind of awkward and avoidant for the rest of the shift but I expected that. I think he will definitely listen and stop, and if he doesn‚Äôt, I can take it to my boss and HR. But I have a good feeling from how things went and felt that it will be ok and won‚Äôt come to that.\n\nI really appreciate all the support and advice today on this post, it helped give me the strength to stand up for myself and actually say something. That‚Äôs something that‚Äôs been very difficult in my life so being able to do that was a big victory for me- I know so many of you here understand that. It makes me sad that so many of you have dealt with situations like this in the workplace too. It  sucks so much to deal with, and I send love to anyone currently having to deal with a coworker like that.\n\nThis is a really special community here and I‚Äôm thankful to have found it. You guys helped me a lot today. Thank you so much again to all of you üíú",

As cliche' as this sounds, she's been the greatest thing to ever happen in my life and I wouldn't trade her for anything. We're college aged lovebirds enjoying every moment together.\n\nI've been staying at her place for about a week and tonight was the first time I've witnessed her PTSD episode come to fruition. Now, I already know about her condition and that she's had flashbacks and episodes before. This all stemmed from growing up with a mother who had multiple personality disorder to where during her mother's bad days she was abused heavily to the point of trauma. As of recent, my GF's episodes have been far less frequent and a lot better, and I personally have never seen it happen. \n\nUntil tonight.\n\nEarlier in the day, she mentioned about having hallucinations and seeing the wall turn from white to purple wavy colors. She mentioned it was really nothing and not bad at all. I put it in the back of my mind and paid no further heed, as the rest of the day was very much a happy one, albeit I did notice her seemingly tired a bit more. \n\nTonight, we were laying in bed and after some merrymaking we were chilling and resting in silence. However, soon I started noticing tears form. She claimed it was nothing, but I knew better. I hugged her and held her close, then she started balling in my shoulder. As I have no experience, I did what I best thought I could do: I kept telling her everything is alright, I'm here, and I'll protect and be with her always no matter what, hugging her as tight as I could.\n\nShe continued for about thirty minutes in my arms, then seemed to have calmed down. She was less audible but she said she felt better. I turned on all the lights and currently have some of her favorite songs playing and get her comfortable enough to get some good sleep. \n\nI haven't had a deep conversation concerning the specifics of how her episodes manifest, what they're like, and how best to deal with them due to not wanting to instigate a possible episode. I've entered in this relationship knowing full well about her condition and I still love her anyways and want to be there even more and help her the best way possible. She's been seeing a therapist near our college since last year, until COVID-19 happened and we moved back to our respective homes from college. She said she dissociated a lot in the past and she's had a mental breakdown episode that lasted for two weeks last year that prompted her to start therapy. \n\nAnyhow, as someone who can say they don't have much experience with PTSD, how can I best help her as her boyfriend? As of now, I cannot physically be with her 24/7, so I'd love to know tips for long distance help as well. Just anything in general to help her through this condition and help her be as happy and feel as safe as possible.",

I responded ‚ÄúOh, I thought it was just depression‚Äù and he gave me a very serious look like ‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs not‚Äù. When I started going to treatment I began to realize why he had that response. It really is something else, a different beast. When I started to explain the, you know, *mirror thing* to him is when he literally dropped his pen, looked up at the ceiling and just had this look on his face of ‚Äúoh my fucking god not her‚Äù‚Ä¶..like he knew how hard this was going to be. I didn‚Äôt know at the time.  I have never seen a human being look that concerned in my life, to this day. Because he studied the brain he knew it to a T, whereas most people don‚Äôt. Still one of the most insane interactions I have ever had in my life, and I‚Äôve had a lot. Still sends me a chill just thinking about it. The look of doom from a psychiatrist that knows you, and has known you since a teenager, is something that will never be erased from my memory, because he saw me grow up. This man is extremely professional. When it set in he looked in the distance for a while. He was stunned.  Has anybody else ever had this interaction or something similar?",

My parents were going to disown me, I could never get married( marriage equality was legalized 8 years after I realized I‚Äôm gay), can‚Äôt have kids, excommunication from orthodox Jewish community, and so many unfortunate traumatic losses that came from realizing I‚Äôm gay in 2007. \n\nI remember my mom would say she hated gays and that fueled my desire to obliterate my gayness. Being gay at the time truly was synonymous with death if I came out at 14 I truly would‚Äôve lost everything. I instantaneously without even realizing went into a trauma response where I destroyed my internal gayness and tragically became my own worst enemy because my gayness was inside of me and it was the biggest threat to my survival. \n\nAfter having this breakthrough I‚Äôve never been happier. I realized in therapy that homophobia 15 years ago isn‚Äôt relevant anymore and the threat has dissipated. Trauma makes you believe and feel as if you‚Äôre still at the time and place the trauma happened. Being gay at the time was the ultimate trauma because I literally could‚Äôve lost everything and other gay teens I knew did loose everything when they came out. \n\nI intrinsically destroyed my heart, mind, and soul because my gayness was dwelling on my feelings, thoughts, and existence. \nBut I‚Äôve accepted my gayness and My mind and heart have returned to me and my soul is on his way. I‚Äôve been living as if that trauma was still true, but it hasn‚Äôt been in a long time. \n\nHomosexuality was never the problem, homophobia always was. \n\nI‚Äôm 29 and feel so behind. I‚Äôm starting my brand new life now, a life without my trauma. \n\nI‚Äôve never been happier and more ecstatic, but the road ahead is daunting.",

Anything that could have gone wrong went wrong. This year alone has unfortunately shafted me in every way possible\n\nIt began with my husband and I got rear-ended in the middle of January. At the end of January, My husband got Covid and was very sick with it. We got our eviction notice in the middle of February. Due to our landlord not paying his mortgage.  After My husband cleared Covid at the end of February he ended up in hospital in a very bad state with severe pneumonia to which the doctors said if he continued to get any worse he would be put into a coma and put on a ventilator. I was terrified of losing my husband as he declined so much to where he was on 50% oxygen within five days of being admitted to the hospital. \n\nWhen My husband got out of the hospital we had to find somewhere to live as we only had four months to leave. We weren‚Äôt having any luck for ages because landlords weren‚Äôt getting back to us. We really felt like we were going to be homeless due to no fault of our own. In May, last minute we got a place.\n\nFive days after we signed our lease we were put into a position we had to foster a cousin of mine to prevent her from going into a random foster home. So I had to try to move house while minding a toddler. Fostering my cousin, blew up the remaining family I had in my life due to lies and other BS.  so the only family member I had left in my life was my husband and my father. \n\nI befriended a girl online in July. She attempted suicide within a few weeks of me knowing her and I found her unconscious with blood everywhere. She berated me for saving her and called me selfish and then she moved to England a week later. My husband was in a crash while on the way to work In August and that itself has been a nightmare dealing with car insurance and getting a new car as our car got written off. \n\nAt the end of September, I went on a night out with a friend, while trying to keep an eye on my drunk friend, I was the one held down and brutally raped‚Ä¶I had bruises on my face, the back of my neck, and an injured shoulder. That itself has been mental torture‚Ä¶ PTSD taking over every aspect of my life. Sleepless nights, extreme anxiety to the point I can barely leave the house most days.

I was a horrible wreck and barely able to function.\n\n1.5 years after that experience, I was able to start therapy. I also went back to physical therapy and both of these therapists kept recommending a book to me about the impact PTSD has on us. It was written by a psychologist who has been treating trauma since the early 1970s, starting with Vietnam War veterans, moving on to specializing in treating people who have been physically or sexually abused as children.\n\nIt took me a long time to finally get this book. I was convinced the connection I had with my body was permanently altered because of this overwhelming experience. I could barely feel my left side, my throat was totally numb from the tube they had down my throat even 2 years later. The sheets of my bed made my skin crawl, reminding me of struggling weakly to move around in the hospital bed. I was too traumatized to believe relief was possible.\n\nThen I started reading this book. Maybe this wont be everyone, but reading this book makes me think that what is happening to me is actually understandable, its manageable, its treatable and its **not permanent**. I can feel more now, things are getting better, its easier for me to de-escalate the tension and stress I feel on a daily basis.\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Body-Keeps-Score-Healing-Trauma/dp/0143127748",

I notice this pattern will come out especially around unsafe and angry men. I‚Äôve done this technique when I felt I was being discriminated against, too. It gets the men to let their guard down, be nicer to me and get what I want because to them I am flattering their ego and playing submissive.

It gave me power over my abusers and I was able to punish men by seducing them and rejecting them and keeping myself safe. \nSometimes I think about about becoming a stripper because I am really good at seducing and making myself Into a man‚Äôs ‚Äúdream girl.‚Äù\n\nWho else relates?",

Lost \"brothers\" to violence, constant worry and fear that you will be next, things of that nature. Much of which begins at a fairly early age. 15 years old for myself. It often times feels as though society as a whole does not give a damn about those of us who survive to be productive adults. Which leads many to go undiagnosed, and afraid to seek help. At 35 years old, I have been fortunate enough to reach out to deal with the many traumatic events that have plaqued my mind for years. Just yesterday learning a name for what I have been experiencing since I left all that behind at 29 years of age. While it feels good to know a name for this...\"hypervigilance\". I think in todays day and age people who have walked similar paths should not be ashamed to ask for help, and also be accepted in a sense. We know the things in are past are wrong and immoral. Many of us have payed for our sins in more ways than one would think. Just a rant and I appologise to anyone I have offended. Thank you.",

    "selftext": "ÔªøEmotional abuse literally drives you crazy. You constantly think you‚Äôre overreacting or that maybe you did deserve the abusive behavior. My father is an attorney so I‚Äôve always learned to have evidence to back up anything I say, with emotional abuse, it‚Äôs very difficult to find evidence outside of a few text messages or emails.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n I had tried explaining what was going on to one therapist I had while I was still unsure of what I was going through and she told me his actions weren‚Äôt abusive. So, I stayed. This is why I always recommend you interview multiple therapists before just picking one to listen to. Had I stayed with that therapist longer, who knows where I would be. After I left the relationship, the lack of evidence drove me insane. I was always in so much psychological pain. I couldn‚Äôt interact with others without tears forming from his voice in my head or having memories pop into my head. I always looked depressed and was never invited to anything as I wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúfun‚Äù enough. I became very aggressive during this time. I was kicked out of a bar and the bouncer called me a bitch/cunt and I went off. Next thing I know I woke up in the hospital with two black eyes. They weren‚Äôt from the bouncer, I had drunkenly stumbled and fell flat on my face. I was so shocked to see how awful I looked, but was at the same time relieved because I was finally able to see pain. Please note that I do NOT recommend accidental or voluntary self harm as according to one of my other therapists, that is common for emotional abuse survivors. Instead we need to break our silence and educate and have people start looking deeper than the skin level and understand that the scars that lie beneath can truly be the deepest. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n This was a post from Instagram \\*\\*he\\_never\\_hit\\_me\\_but\\*\\* and really spoke to me and helped me understand my need for self harm and how it isn‚Äôt the answer.",

    "selftext": "Hi Sorry for the long post, ive not really made a post before and my thoughts are all over the place at the moment.\n\nNot many people I know professionally know that I have PTSD. It's something I've been made to be ashamed about after working on a psychiatric ward and now while I study my Msc.\n\nI was on a 1:1 with a patient who was in the midst of a breakdown and was performing similar (and very distressing) behaviours as my abuser. When I asked my co-workers for help they told me they would come and assist. I was left waiting for 4 hours, (even though I was only supposed to be on 1:1 for an hour, as trust policy dictates). I told them that was not ok and to not do that again. They did it again the next shift I was with them.\n\nAt the next staff meeting I told the team about this incidence and how it should not be happening, if a staff member needs to tap out, they should be able to tap out. The manager said I was right to tell everyone and she would have words with the staff on shift that day. I was really happy to have had that conversation and to have it out in the air.\n\nFast forward to handover straight after the meeting, where there were 10 nurses in the nurses office, I was sitting down while everyone was standing around me. The manager walks in and says are we looking after \\*my name\\* or are we looking after the patients? Everyone, apart form one nurse who saw me burst out laughing. Another nurse said I shouldn't be in the job. I coughed loudly and everyone went quiet. I walked out and kept myself busy looking after my patients.\n\nAnother time my colleagues said they could never be friends with/date someone who has mental health issues.\n\nWhilst studying my masters a student in my cohort noted how PTSD is a disease and that those with PTSD have deformed brains. Well yeah I have a deformed brain but its not my fault, I went through shit, and that effected my neurology as it would anyone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Am I just being really sensitive?\n* Is there anyone else out there who works in mental health that has experienced the same?\n* Those who look after others are humans themselves, surely we're allowed to have mental health issues aswell?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think going through my own mental health issues actually made me a better nurse because I know the *depths* patients are talking about.\n\nI'm just frustrated, I'm largely ok now, I have the occasional wobble here and there but I pick myself up and carry on fighting. I don't even know if I should carry on trying to be a psychologist. But I don't want the career I've always wanted to be another thing he has robbed from me\n\n&#x200B;\n\np.s. **Please please please** reach out for help if you need it, don't be put off by a few vile creatures I've worked with. Not all mental healthcare professionals are like this, I have had the pleasure of meeting some individuals in the industry who have restored my faith in humanity (which is no small task).",

I have flashbacks that paralyze me in the middle of a task. And I have triggers - so many of them, some of them obvious, some of them just bizarre. One such trigger was last week, when a AC130, or a plane similar to it, flew above my house in San Jose. [I posted in another subreddit about it but the responses were callous and unsympathetic](https://www.reddit.com/r/SanJose/comments/n1ay9g/had_panic_attacks_yesterday_from_ac130_gunship/). In that incident, I thought I was back in the war zone. I was frozen, fearful, and I cried. I am trying to seek therapy for my trauma but I do not have insurance and cannot pay out of pocket for those hefty rates.

Whenever i would see her (starting again at age 6) her symptoms would have her be extremely volatile. She wouldn't give me affection unless it was a show for someone else, called me her niece in public for a while, drank all the time, and made her adult problems mine. I had to escort her out of family parties at 10 when she would get drunk and belligerent. When I was 13 or so I remember she spit on me. When I was 16 she chased me into a bathroom and told be she was going to beat my ass because I started calling my step mom \"mom\" too. I never called her by her name to her face, she just didnt want to share. Following 16, she started with a lot of false suicide attempts for attention, which I always treated seriously. Our relationship was so weird. First she didnt want me, then we were familiar strangers, acquaintances, distant cousins, and then friends.\n\nUntil her last suicide attempt, that accidentally went through. The table broke under her. The police I called called me to come down.  It was the day before her dads 70th birthday, and I had to tell him to his face that his daughter was never coming back. \n\nI did her makeup for her viewing. It's the least I could do. I loved her so much, in the most damaging way to myself. I put up with everything because it was obvious her BPD made her suffer and everyone except her family left her. I couldnt stop grasping for the love she wasnt able to give. \n\nNow I struggle to get and keep jobs. That was only the worst thing that happened to me. I had a marriage with a man that was practically the Male version of her, and I was raped after I left him...I got catfished...please dont call me stupid I was vulnerable. It took 9 months to meet. \n\n\nNow the obvious triggers get to me, cluttered houses, crowds, loud places, and the month of July is awful for me. \n\nSorry this was so long. \n\n\n\nTL;DR \n\nMom had BPD, was abusive, killed herself and involved me. Now the obvious triggers get to me, cluttered houses, crowds, loud places, and the month of July is awful for me.\n\nEdit: I havent cried about this in months, and now I'm sitting on my hallway floor, leaking through my eyes, and thinking about learning how to paint so I can get my nightmares out.",

    "selftext": "I died six years ago, a victim of domestic violence. You don't hear our stories because we are called liars, babies, not man enough, stupid, etc. \"Who are they going to believe, a 6 foot tall man or a 5 foot tall girl\" I was often told when I said one day I would run away and she couldn't find me. She would punch herself in the face and say I did it. She would grab hammers and threaten to bruise herself and say she would tell the cops I did it and she would get a warrant out for my arrest if I tried to leave. I was trapped.\n\nMen can be raped as well. My abuser raped be on several occasions. If I couldn't get it up after hours of abuse I was called every name in the book and told \"What kind of f****t can't get up to an attractive woman?\". If I refused she would tell me there would be \"consequences\" and never describe what they were. Sometimes she would say things like \"I will wait for you at your mom's and you will see the consequences\" which typically made me do whatever she wanted. If I ever finished too quickly she made me sleep on the wooden floor in the corner of the room as punishment for \"using her like a piece of meat\".\n\nI have been free of her for 3 years but her words and actions still haunt me. A simple nod or a juice container can send me into a panic attack. Those around me look at me like I am some weird weak man. They don't know the stories of men like me because no one cares about our stories.\n\nJohnny Depp may know from his situation he is dealing with. But even in the press he is slandered on the fact he is a man. I know people will not believe my story too. My abuser has spent years creating paper trails and stories for this very moment. She's made me say multiple times that I was the abuser just to calm her down. She's hit me behind closed doors and screamed at me that I was hitting her. She took complete control of my finances. I was not allowed to make a purchase without her approval. I worked full days while she sat and took money from my account into her private account as she watched television. She made me put mint oil on my crotch when I told her I was reading an email but was really playing a game on my phone as \"punishment\" for not watching her get ready. \n\nShe made me get rid of my dog and didn't let me see my family other than maybe once or twice a year. She made me lie and tell them all I was homeless to get money even though I was well off to fund her trips to Louisiana, New York, Spain, etc. Every day my appearance was scrutinized until I acted and looked almost exactly how she wanted. She turned most of my friends against me with lies and half truths.\n\nEveryday I struggle to just get to the next day. I don't sleep. I can't work more than a few hours a day. Constant flashbacks keep me trapped in my head. Depression and anxiety make things like answering the phone near impossible and medication has not helped because the memories don't disappear. Every day I try to be something but deep down I know I am not living up to the expectations I have about myself which causes further stress.",

Was the final straw.\n\n11 years of alcoholism later (July 5, 2018) I drowned while intoxicated in front of my healthy 3 year old and 10 year old. 10 minutes underwater, 3 days in coma and thought to be brain dead, I woke up.\n\nTook me 1 more year to get completely sober. Sober since June 2019 and I have also conquered my PTSD. There is HOPE. Do not give up and please get help. It is work and initially very hard, but the alternatives can be horrible for you and your loved ones.",

    "selftext": "Hey yall! So I briefly wanted to explain some of the neurobiology behind ptsd, cus this will give insight and possibly allow you to make some good decisions regarding treatment. So essentially as you probably know, trauma puts us in a chronic fight flight freeze state. When were in fight or flight, our cortisol rises very high giving us the energy to do so. But after a certain point of too much stress, our cortisol downregulates and we freeze. Its our bodies way of saying, \"nope this is too much i cant fight anymore so this has to stop\". When were traumatized our bodies neurochemistry gets thrown way off, so we develop high levels of glutamate, norepinepherine and sometimes dopamine but not always. Our serotonin levels may drop as well as GABA cus when glutamate and norepinepherine go up, serotonin and gaba go down. So were constantly flooded with excitatory neurotransmitters and not enough inhibitory neurotransmitters.\n\nAlong with this, high levels of glutamate become excitotoxic, resulting in shrinking of the hippocampus and cell death in the brain. Yes, keeping our stress levels so high in ptsd can cause actual brain damage. Its why for so many people, lamictal/lamotrigine has helped immensely with their symptoms. It reduces glutamate which inadvertly reduces norepinepherine and allows serotonin and gaba to increase. \n\nResearchers hypothesize that the hyperarousal component of PTSD is mainly due to the high norepinepherine keeping us im an overly sensitive state. Some people have found relief in medications such as clonidine which lower norepinepherine.\n\nAlso researchers hypothesize that high amounts of  excitatory neurotransmitters may be the cause for dissociative states, because they keep the body constantly overstimulated.",

I froze when i saw him, hell at first i dissociated so hard that I barely recognized him, but managed to get out of the situation without breaking down. Later on, back at ny friend's camp, I told my \"best friend\", in quotations because I seriously don't know if she is even my friend anymore, and she just said \"Okay\" and started talking about something else. I told my brother and he didn't say much either. So I left it be.\n\nAt the bar I used to spend my saturday evenings everyone believes my rapist because \"he wouldn't do such a thing\". I'm not welcome there anymore.\n\nAnd before you flame me, I know I should have gone to the cops back then right away after it happened. I KNOW! I kick myself every day for it. I got raped and abused a lot when I was a kid and getting raped again triggered my PTSD so severely that I was completely out of it for weeks after it happened. I was too fucked up to go to the cops. I had no one who would have helped me, even my bf at the time. The dude was his best friend at the time, so I guess I know why... \n\nI'm sorry, by now I am just ranting. I know I should have reported him when I still had enough evidence and that's probably why not everyone believes me but goddamnit, I'm just so done with everything... People often come to me for help and advice when they feel down, I cheered up my \"best friend\" for weeks after her ex broke up, but when I have something on my mind, it just seems like it's not worth their time.\n\nSo to the point; I need new friends, don't I?\n\n\n\nEdit: Oh wow, I never thought this would get so much attention, I thought I may get a comment or two if I get lucky.

I could barely walk to transit after, and I cried the whole way. Yet, just before in the therapy session, the practioner seemed very impressed that I could take so much pain that he gave me extra needling up my spine and around my neck. I took an epsom salt bath that night, as recommended, for the soreness.\n\nToday, I woke up and felt weird in my body. I sobbed for about 15 minutes. Then, I had a miraculous kind of feeling. An inzcredible lightness of being. Sort of like falling in love. It's the lack of tension around my heart. I was sort of scared to go to work because my emotional body armor was missing. I wasn't sure if I could be around people without that physical barrier. It's taken me years to build up such a thick layer of tension!!\n\nJust wanted to share how ptsd manifests in my body.\n\nEdit: Since the treatment I've found it a bit emotionally daunting to be so open.

I dissociate on a physical level and often won't notice an injury until I see it in the mirror, or somebody asks me about that bruise.

Also yes, trauma is subjective but there does need to be some real layer of threat there for it to even get to the level of it turning into PTSD.

It was not my choice to have him, but it was my choice to keep him. and he is the best thing that has ever happened to me.**\n\n**story: My girlfriend's parents (who I live with) moved into a house which is two 4 bedroom houses connected together by a small door downstairs. Me and my girlfriend live together in one of the houses, and her parents live in the other. in our house we each have our own bedrooms, but tend to sleep in the same room, with Logan. he has his room which is more of a playroom at the moment because he still sleeps in a cot in our room. my gf takes pride in the fact that she always keeps the house clean and loves to clean. also, we still technically live with her parents.**\n\n**we have regular social services visits to make sure that we are all OK because we are so young, she is 16 as well. our neighbours (not her parents but the ones next to us on our side) are entitled parents. and this week came to our house about 10 minutes before a social service visit. they started screaming at us for having a child so young. i have extreme social anxiety and ptsd from when i got pregnant with him. I don't tell anyone that i don't trust completely about his father. so our neighbours don't know about the circumstances about him.**\n\n**on this particular day she sees me and my gf playing with our son in the garden. he is only wearing his underwear because it is a hot day and he is in the pool. and he has plenty of sun-cream on. she comes knocking on my gfs parents door. her parents tell her that we live next-door not with them. she comes and knocks on our door and is shouting about how we shouldn't be living on our own, and we should have a responsible adult in the house. she then starts shouting about how we probably abuse Logan. she then asks how old i am and i tell her i'm 16, she slaps me and tells me that i am way too young to have a child and that i'm lying to her about him being my son. i tell her that he is my son and i was just young when i had him. she slaps me again and calls the police telling them that I've kidnapped a child. i start having a flashback because it was a very triggering situation. she then starts saying that our house is a mess. my gf was so angry but at this point is focusing on my more than the woman. then she sees my son and accuses us of sexually abusing him because he is only wearing his underwear! this is too much for me and i pass out because that can happen in ptsd. once I had come around and calmed down the woman started telling me i was overreacting. so i just turned around and told her the truth \"I WAS RAPED, I DIDN'T WANT HIM TO DO IT! IT WASN'T MY FAULT\" remember i'm 16 so this was a pretty scary situation for me in this moment. the crazy neighbour looks horrified and starts calling me all sorts of racial and religious slurred. ( which doesn't make sense because i am white french living in England!) also, i am still in my wheelchair because i was using it in the garden, so she kicks my wheelchair and breaks it!**\n\n**i turn around and the social worker had seen it all. the social worker explained to them woman that i was a teen parent, and then the police arrested the crazy neighbour! social services took her kids off of her during the trial! i pressed chargers and she was fined. she did get her kids back but she never bothered us again after that. all is going well now and social services were very happy about how we handled the situation!**",

When I told my school guidance councillor she was mandated to report it and an investigation was initiated. On the morning of my first interview with the police my dad took me to breakfast at my favour restaurant in our small town, where he said, ‚Äúyou can either put your brother in jail, or you can keep the family together.‚Äù I lied to the police, told them I didn‚Äôt want to talk about it. The investigation went away. My parents never punished Nick, when the investigation was over they let him pick any city in the US and they would help him move there. He picked NYC. That was 11 years ago.\n\nIve kept my silence to keep the family together. My parents keep reminding me in our bi/trimonthly family fights that ‚Äòthere was nothing we could do.‚Äô and \\*\\*‚Äòthere will be no more family if you keep up with this.‚Äô\\*\\*\n\nMy brother is always playing the saint and they just fawn over how success and accomplished he is. He‚Äôs seen as the darling helper who could do no wrong.\n\nWhenever I try to talk to my family about what he did they tell me, ‚ÄòTell your therapist that, not us.‚Äô\n\nIn my Mom and I‚Äôs most recent fights, she let out a tirade of ‚Äòwhy didn‚Äôt you tell me it was happening? why didn‚Äôt you tell me one time?‚Äô And then followed that up with, ‚ÄòWhen I was a little girl I prayed to God that I would have kids, but now after all of this I wish I Never was a Mom.‚Äô\n\nI have been trying to go NC with my brother but my family doesn‚Äôt seem to respect that. I often get texts from him in the family group text saying overly positive shit like nothings up. He‚Äôs coming to Christmas, and my parents wanted me to go on a trip with everyone else including him and his girlfriend where I would be expected to ‚ÄòNot make a scene.‚Äô\n\nI need some sort of grounding because I‚Äôve been keeping quiet with this hell of family and rape for 21 years, first so my brother wouldent get in trouble, and secondly so my parents wouldent look bad to their family and friends.\n\nThe biggest hypocrisy of this is that I was sexually abused as a child by another perpetrator. A older man who abused me for 2 years concurrently with the time I was being abused at home. I told my mom what had happened, he then was charged and convicted and sentenced to jail. I had my parents full support then. I told my parents about this man abusing me in particular first so they would know how to handle my brother. Turns out they didn‚Äôt. I am still glad I told them in that order, because if I had told them about my brother and then the older man they would have covered up both, and I likely would have killed myself from the stress that I otherwise barely survived.\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for your support.",

    "selftext": "I was raised in a \"Christian home\", and for many years I believed in the theology that I was taught from a young age. However, due to incidents that happened to me during my childhood and my adult life I found it put strain on my religious beliefs. They're not the only reason I turned away from God, as I've put myself into the agnostic category because of faults I've found with Christianity, as well as the idea of a personal God. But my personal reasons have nonetheless played a part in it. How could they not?\n\nEven if there is a personal God (as in a God that cares about you and what you do, listens to your prayers, etc) I've found the idea of wanting to having a relationship with him to be (for lack of a better word) difficult. I have a friend who I sometimes talk to, and her advice usually goes something like this: \n\n\\- God loves us. He will make something good out of all of this suffering.\n\n\\- God is good.\n\n\\- Trust. Believe. Keep the faith.\n\nThese phrases sound inspiring, but I find them to be shallow and simple. I think it's easy for a person who does well in life, or goes through something hard and comes out better for it to give thanks to God. But what about all of the people God doesn't help? Everyday, as I drive to or from work, I see homeless people sitting on the side of the road living in tents, I hear about people being raped and murdered on the news. I hear about people being kidnapped and being held for years against their will. I see greedy politicians on TV who are legally stealing from the citizens they are supposed to serve. I see war and disease. \n\nPerhaps I'm jaded, but I find this constant rat race we're in to be tiring. \n\nIf there is a God, I find myself not wanting anything to do with him anymore. I don't want to worship him, I don't want to know him. At one time I may have. But I found him to be rather impersonal for a God who is supposedly personal. Where were you God? Where were you when I was being abused? Why didn't you stop it, or give me the strength to stop it on my own? And after each time, as the abuse happened over and over again, you expect me to come crawling back to you looking for love and protection and a relationship? I don't want to. I'm sorry God, but I don't love you. I don't love your creation. I don't want to be a part of it. I didn't ask for this. I have so much hate and disgust in me that I want nothing to do with you. And yes, I guess according to Christianity I may go to Hell for saying that. But you know what? When I die, I don't want an afterlife. I don't want your Heaven or your Hell.\n\nI'm sorry for the rant, but I had to get this out. Thanks for listening.",

Murder, rapes, attacks, and the investigations that follow are messy, gritty, and sad. \n\nTrue crime treats the victims of trauma like characters in a story. Imagine if your trauma, or abuser, or rapist, was glorified. Victims are eventually reduced down to names and ages.

    "selftext": "Trigger warning: CSA\n\nMy step brother molested me when I was 10 years old. We were on a family vacation and he snuck up on me in bed and messed with me.\n\nI kept it a secret forever bc I was mortified. I tried to tell my older brother once, and he didn't say anything to anyone either so I gave up for a while. I eventually told my mom, who immediately told my dad by bitching him out. As far as I can recall, nothing came out of this either bc I was still forced to visit my dad every other weekend and still forced to be sleeping in the same house as this guy until I was 18. \n\nI definitely developed PTSD and never realized it most my life until I started going to therapy as a 30+ adult. This has caused me so much shame, guilt, re-traumatization, sleepless nights, relationship issues, suicidal thoughts, etc.. You guys know what I mean.\n\nFast forward to 2019, and I find out from my aunt that my dad is intending to have my step brother over for our family gathering to celebrate my dad and my Nana's bdays (mind you, the rest of the family don't like him either for various reasons like him calling my brother fat and other charming things like that) so I called my dad and let him know how that makes me feel and how I can't be around that guy ever again. Didn't work, had to see the guy, sucked ass for me, etc.\n\nFast forward to Father's day last night. We're at dinner, and my dad brings up the topic. We're about to have our family gathering for dad/Nana's bday again in a couple of weeks. Dad wants to know how we can \"resolve this.\" I tell him that I WON'T be in the same place as my step brother anymore, and that if he intends on having him there, I won't be going. My dad spins a sad tale about how my step brother is getting divorced and only gets to see the kids at certain times and blah blah blah. Basically, he knows his wife wants to have my step bro over that weekend, and he wants to know how he can make it as comfortable as possible for himself. I was under the impression that he told his wife about it in 2019 bc she was in the fucking background, but apparently not and now he's asking me to tell her. \n\nSo now, my father has set me up to re-traumatize myself by telling my story again to my step mother (who has shown support for public figures having allegations against them and blamed victims) about what her son did to me. He was nice enough (sarcasm) to prepare me by saying \"I really don't know what she's going to say to you, she might blow up.\" \n\nIf I don't tell her, then my step bro will most certainly be at the party, and I'll either need to be around him again or miss one of my favorite events bc my out of town family will be here to visit.\n\nThanks for anyone who made it this far.. would definitely be open to any advice if anyone has any.... üò≠\n\n**EDIT:** Wow. I am so floored and so appreciative of everyone's nice words and encouragement. I really needed to hear them because when I'm around him, I tend to cower and let him get away with murder. IDK why I am still so scared to really unleash on him.. he certainly hasn't been afraid to make me feel like shit.\n\nHere's a fun (sarcasm) little comment I received yesterday morning too: \"don't try and tell [step mom] today, we found another leak in our roof this morning so things are really hectic around here.\" \n\nTHE FUCKING ROOF IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN ME AND MY FEELINGS. I have therapy tomorrow, thank GOODNESS.",

I just started a YouTube channel on talking openly about mental\nHealth issues and how I deal with my conditions as naturally as possible.  So I got my phone out and FILMED my Panic Attack - and how I was able to calm Myself down.  \n\nAnd it worked!  I got out my essential oils and worry stone and did deep breathing and practiced gratitude.  My panic attack went away, and I was able to go back into the office and not feel like a complete loser for losing my shit in there.

He literally listened to me talk about rocks. I managed to pull myself back and finish having sex with him, and he was gentle even though I knew it wasn‚Äôt his preference. I kept apologizing to him about everything that happened and he told me it was okay, and to stop apologizing. \n\nThis is a huge event for me. Disclosure to a sexual partner has never been successful for me. Most of the time it doesn‚Äôt happen. Potential relationships have been impaired by my avoidance. Disclosure itself carries trauma for me. I‚Äôve been talking in therapy about how to disclose for years. So this is a big deal for me. And I‚Äôm proud of me. I hope that this means I‚Äôll start being able to have this discussion with more serious romantic partners and I‚Äôll stop ruining relationships. ",

My ptsd is related to multiple sexual assualts I have experienced throughout my life. Seeing all these men who have been accused of such heinous acts suffering seemingly no consequences whatsoever (which I‚Äôm all too familiar with) is tearing me up inside.  It‚Äôs like people just don‚Äôt care. Except I know many do, and they voted and they tried to stop this. I know I did. But ugh, it‚Äôs just killing me. I feel so stupid getting so worked up over it. But why do these men never suffer consequences. It‚Äôs not fucking fair. I‚Äôve had my life ripped apart by guys like this for fucking DECADES and now I have to watch these kind of men run the country. Look I know there were always people like this running the country, but now these allegations are so public and it‚Äôs like it doesn‚Äôt matter at all. I can‚Äôt take it. Just wondering if anyone else feels this way? \n\n\nEDIT: Thank you all for the responses. Though I hate others can relate so well to how I‚Äôm feeling, it does help a lot to not feel so alone and pathetic. I really appreciate you all for helping me out. I‚Äôm sorry I don‚Äôt have the bandwidth to respond to each response individually, but you guys seriously brought me back from a very dark place when I posted this morning. Knowing there are so many others that share my suffering is motivating me to push harder to fight this evil in whatever way I can. ",

    "selftext": "March 16th, also known as the anniversary of when I got my last D on a report card. \n\nWARNING: This gets really dark really fast, so the faint of heart should turn back. \n\n*My dad was a bit of a drinker.*\n\nI was in third grade. I was a bit of trouble child (mostly a slacker) in school. Not at home. God forbid. I hid my report card and he found it. On his birthday. My sister told me he found it so I hid outside. Big mistake. \n\nWorst hide and seek game ever. He came outside with his shotgun. He went to my pet rooster, who shares my very rare name, and shot his head off. ‚ÄúThe mutt is next if you don‚Äôt get your ass out here!‚Äù I continued to watch from my spot in the bush. My dog was indeed next. I cried out and he found me. He chased me across the yard and tackled me. \n\nAfter carrying me inside by  the back of my neck, he broke my nose on a wall. Blood spouted from my nose, down the pale yellow wallpaper, and seeped into the carpet. Told me I‚Äôm a failure. Shoved my bloody nose back into the wall and brought out ‚ÄúThe Slapper,‚Äù a leather belt he carved up and kept in a bucket of water; you know, for these special occasions. He made me stand with my arms out, moving them up and down. For three hours. ‚ÄúIf I could do this in football practice you can do it now!‚Äù \n\n(Yeah, that high school you dropped out of in 10th grade?) \n\nPeriodically he‚Äôd come over and tire his arm out with that belt. Blood covered me. My face, my spiderman shirt, my blue shorts, socks. But the back was the worst. He didn‚Äôt go for my ass. Lacerations covered my tiny back. Blood slicked the back of my shirt and shorts. I still have the scars. \n\n(I *used* to be reminded every time I look in the mirror. I‚Äôve healed enough now to see myself as who I truly am and not the helpless, abhorrent, bastard abomination they tried to mold me into.) \n\nAfter I missed dinner and said I was hungry, he threw my rooster‚Äôs head at me and told me to eat it if I was really that hungry. I wasn‚Äôt. \n\nHe made me clean the blood until I passed out at 3am. The next day, he cooked my favorite meal, took me fishing, and bought me an RC car; unheard of. \n\n\n\nSo yeah, that‚Äôs a bit much for‚Ä¶ what a seven year old? \n\nThat anniversary is tomorrow. \n\nI‚Äôve missed almost a week of work and have ignored all my responsibilities. Outwardly I seem fine and happy and enjoying our new puppy. But inside idk how I feel. It‚Äôs a mix of ‚Äúwhy tf can‚Äôt I have a decent family‚Äù and ‚Äúwhy tf do people keep treating me like shit.‚Äù Anger, humiliation, deep sadness, self disgust, and negative self talk have inhabited my brain while I sit and play Skyrim for hours on end. I‚Äôve had night terrors for the past week as well. \n\nI told my fianc√© the whole story today. She held me tightly afterwards and we sobbed together. She noticed that I still blame myself. ‚ÄúI should have done better in school.‚Äù ‚ÄúIf I came out of my hiding place I could have saved my dog.‚Äù Sounds absurd hearing it aloud. My father was a deranged maniac, none of that was my fault. He killed other pets of mine, it was inevitable. I never deserved this. \n\nShe suggested that we both write letters to our younger selves, and no matter how painful or uncomfortable, we will share them with each other. I might share mine on here later, who knows. \n\nI love this woman to death. She‚Äôs a ride or die kinda gal and she‚Äôs always had my back. I‚Äôm going to marry her ass so hard. \n\n\n\nPost Script: \nTo give some people a sense of relief: I was saved when I was in fourth grade. Adopted into a semi-functional family. This certainly wasn‚Äôt the only event in my childhood, but through therapy and meds, I have healed immensely. Additionally, I have a great support system.\n\n\n\nEdit: [Not posting the letter to lil me but here is a thing I wrote a while back.

    "title": "My husband is triggering trauma responses and refuses to attend marriage counseling to work on things. How can I work on things?",
    "selftext": "I, 26f, have been together with my husband, 31m, for about 4 years and married for 1. In the year we have been married, it has felt like a steady decline in our relationship. We have been fighting to an increasing degree to where I sometimes dread coming home. \n\nMost of my grievances come from feeling that my boundaries are not being respected. I am a survivor of childhood abuse and sexual assault, so physical intimacy can be very challenging for me, especially if I don't feel my boundaries are being respected. My husband has stated that he views my trauma responses as me being \"cold and frigid\" and that I just need to \"suck it up and get over it\".\n\nWhat I don't understand is that he never complained about how affectionate I am before we got married and I never changed my habits. After months of him telling me I am never affectionate, I started tracking how often I am affectionate each day and made an effort to be more affectionate. When we got into another argument about it and he made the statement that I am \"never\" affectionate once again, I pointed out how often I am affectionate, and the efforts I have made to increase this. He stated that it wasn't good enough and that it should just be whenever he wants the attention and affection, as he views this as my duty as his wife.\n\nHe is very forceful and confrontational when he seeks any kind of affection, and while I try not to make him feel rejected, the way he forces himself on me is very hard for me to handle when it causes so much stress, anxiety and traumatic flash backs. He was never like this before we got married. And he knew from the beginning that I struggled with PTSD. I never hid it from him. Now, sometimes it almost feels like he's trying to provoke this kind of reaction from me.\n\nI have tried to communicate how I feel in non confrontational ways and explain to him the logical reasons for my reactions when he violates my boundaries, however my husband refuses to acknowledge any accountability for his words and actions. I have asked him several times over the last few months to go to marriage counseling with me so we can work on our marriage, however, he adamantly refuses. \n\nMy husband has flat out told me that he believes that he has never done anything wrong and that if I find any issue in our marriage it is my problem. That our arguments are solely my fault, and that I need to \"get over\" my \"issues\" and \"get on some meds\". \n\nI'm honestly at a loss at this point and I feel devastated and ashamed that my marriage has fallen to this point. I've only confided in one close friend about all of this, but they're at as much of a loss for what to do as I am. I couldn‚Äôt bear the shame and embarrassment of getting a divorce. My husband is all I have since my family disowned me for marrying him, but I don't know how much longer I can live this way. I've started to reach a point where I just don't know how I feel about him anymore. What do I do to work on things when he won't go to marriage counseling? \n\n\nTL,DR: My husband will not respect my boundaries and insists that in spite of the constant fighting we do not need marriage counseling because the only problem with our marriage is me. How do I work on repairing our marriage when he won't participate in counseling?\n\nEdit 1: Thank you everyone for the responses. I appreciate the advice. I would like to clarify, as I've seen a lot of replies encouraging me to get back in contact qith my family, that it's not an option. My mother is a narcissistic abuser who was abusive to me my entire life and is a big reason I struggle with CPTSD. I had to cut contact after she began harassing me for marrying my husband as she is a racist and does not approve of his race. It never had anything to do with how my husband treats me. Going no contact with my family was a long time coming.",

Imagine what he tries to pull in DMs if he has any illusion of privacy.\n\n[Here's him hitting on OP because her history of sexual abuse is just so sexy and perfect.](https://np.reddit.com/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/lhbc5i/tw_sexual_abuse_would_you_datebe_interested_in_a/gmwp505/) \n-------------------\n> I ONLY date women like you. No, I am not some derranged perv with a thing for victimized girls. I am a male survivor with pretty significant trauma and 30 years of PTSD. You are like the perfect woman to me. I don't have to explain a thing, you already get it. People with traumatic childhoods speak a common language. We have similar issues to deal with, maybe even the same triggers. I have been with \"normal\" women. Never again. They are belittling and cruel. You my type and I cannot be alone in this. 1 in 4 girls. 1 in 5 boys. That's millions of people.\n\nTopic title:\n> [TW Sexual Abuse] Would you date/be interested in a girl that had been sexually abused as a young child?\n\nApparently he exclusively dates sexual abuse survivors because they can \"\"relate\"\" to him. Only they also have to be half his age, because he fetishizes age gaps. Oh, and he prefers chubby women because they're \"more giving with themselves\", and \"more willing\". (Don't worry, we'll get to the lovely comments about that!)\n\nSeems *legit.*\n\nThat whole suspiciously-enthusiastic, unprovoked, very r/SelfAwareWolves Not A Perv I Swear speech is because multiple people confronted him yesterday-ish about this. He's in full defense mode. Dude sure does like his \"my creepy sexual preferences are all because of PTSD, so I shouldn't have to worry about whether I'm hurting anyone else with them\" excuses.\n\nNormal women are so bitter and cruel...lol. They call him creepy just for wanting to jack off to your sexual abuse, guys. :( This poor victim. There must be a conspiracy among all the woman who aren't half his age and so broken that he seems normal and safe for longer than 30 seconds. Yeah, that must be it.\n\nHe gets one creeped-out reply. As with every other comment from someone he creeps out, he immediately ghosts the conversation. Perhaps because he's had this conversation quite often *(for some mysterious reason)* and already knows how it's going to go, and he just doesn't care? \n\nBut that's just my best guess at interpreting complete silence from someone who has had no counterargument to \"wtf this is predatory\" besides \"I have PTSD and I'm immature so I've decided it's okay. Anyways, why am I all alone? It's so sad how *\"\"\"normal\"\"\"* women can't stand me, even tho I'll never post a specific example because people sure do always agree with the womens' concerns whenever I do.\"\n\n[Here's him beelining to a topic posted by a virgin to give creepy, lurid \"advice\" that's really just him fantasizing about the situation.](https://np.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/lg9i7f/first_time_with_a_girl_and_im_freaking_out/gmq4txw/)\n-------------------\n> Be cool. You guys are smack in the middle of that amazing young, lusty, passionate, mind-blowing sex phase that makes life worth living. Just go with it and try not to over-think the situation. Instead of panic about how you might fuck it all up in the future, live in the moment. Appreciate the fact that this girl is super into you right now. Nothing lasts forever, especially not these white-hot hookups. That doesn't mean they aren't worthwhile. Have high hopes but keep expectations low. Also, form your own opinions of people. That shade about her being impulsive and emotionally unavailable has little to do with your current situation. That's the past. People can stop being impulsive and unavailable when they enter into a more appealing relationship. It's possible. So, take it as it comes. And if in the end it falls apart, at least you got to experience that passion. A lot of people are too boring and too careful to even allow themselves this pleasure. Let it do what it do.\n\n[Here's him reviewing womens' bodies. This isn't inherently bannable, but it is so fucking gross. You creepy fuck.](https://np.reddit.com/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/lhaqaa/people_who_like_chubby_girls_what_is_it_that/gmw9r1g/)\n-------------------\n> Skinny girls are okay to look at (sort of) because of the way clothing fits them. Fashionable Western clothing styles are usually fitted to be worn by lean women. I don't subscribe to these standards. I like thick women. It's disapointing when a great beauty has no ass on her. That beautiful, big ass on a chubby woman is only part of it, though.\n\n> Skinny women are bony af. Ever lay with a skinny chick? She's all elbows and knee caps. Sometimes a woman is so petite I feel like I might break her on accident. A chubby woman is much softer, and to me, much more pleaseant to lay with. Simply put, they feel better to me. There's one more societal reason guys dig the chubby women of the world.\n\n> They try harder. A thin woman who grew up skinny has never known the ridicule that fat women endure. A woman who's been told her whole life that she's \"hot\" will assume her mere physical presence is enough. I find skinny women are sometimes a bit full of themselves, especially if they're also blonde. Maybe it's just where I grew up, idk? A chubby woman who isn't accustomed to these platitudes and accolades isn't so full of herself. She's typically nicer, more generous with herself, and a more willing partner. It's the same for men, too. People who're told over and over they're the embodiment of some highly desirable feature mistakenly think it's all they need to bring when it comes to relations. Chubby women don't usually fall into that trap. Mad love for the chubs!\n\nHey look, ***he targets women who \"try harder\" and are \"more willing\" (because they have presumed low self-esteem).***\n\nOh sure, this poor little victim has noooo predatory motivations when he targets young sexually-abused women. He just wants someone who understaaaaaands him.\n\nSure, buddy.\n\n[Here's him victim-blaming someone in this sub for daring to expect men on dating apps to not be emotionally abusive, because \"let's be real\", ~~boys will be boys~~ men are just like that.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/lfpznk/dating_is_exhausting_tw_sex/gmnd5u7/)\n-------------------\n> I think you're really good at making excuses for why you cannot do things. Let's be honest here. Many guys are gonna be emtionally abusive regardless of your status as a survivor. What your comment says is you're still filled with lots of trepidation and feelings of unsafe vulnerability. Finding a match is an act of vulnerability. You might be excluding a lot of potentially good matches simply becuase you aren't ready to be vulnerable. It happens. We want recovery to occur quicker than it does and feel impatient we,'re not \"where we should be\". I get the deep lonliness. Remember I said I've had some success on reddit? I have been living in crazy, PTSD induced isolation, waiting 30+ years to find a woman like this. She's a survivor. She gets me. Talk to me in 2050 about your lonliness\n\nLet me set aside a sec to wtf at \"my loneliness is so much worse than urs, OP, let me flex about that real quick\" but at this point, that's just a drop in the bucket.\n\n[Oh and this guy, who - remember! - exclusively dates sexually-abused women, actively targets 'teens' in the \"age gap personals\" subreddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/lfpznk/dating_is_exhausting_tw_sex/gmn89ls/)\n--------------------\n> B) I have great success finding like-minded peeps here on reddit. There are tons of subreddits for dating. Because of severe trauma and PTSD I ***[48 M]*** am kinda trapped in the mind of a teen, so I've used the \"Age Gap Personals\" sub to find women closer to my mental age. You may want to skew your dating search older as a more mature man will (hopefully) not act like such fuck boi. Obviously, anything on reddit has the potential to turn into a gutter.\n\nGee, I wondered where all the refugees from r/jailbait went! \n\nDude just *loves* the obvious pedo-magnet community that inevitably only survives because they insist you lie and say you're 18. I'm not clicking in there, but let me guess: the vast majority of the population is old looking for young. \n\nWhat a chickenhawk coop. Let's play a game: guess how many IPs in there are coming from prisons, or the residences of known sex offenders? \n\n[Oh, and OP should fix her post-sexual-abuse dating problems....by not just lowering her standards, but dating older men ***and*** advertising her abuse to them on dating sites more often.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/lfpznk/dating_is_exhausting_tw_sex/gmn89ls/)\n-------------------\n> C) whatever you do, I strongly advise you to disclose your situation i.e. recovering from sexual assault but tryna get back into dating. The honesty will attract the kind of sensitive, emotionally mature men you're looking for.\n\n**He is literally targeting people** ***in this subreddit*** **and trying to convince them to heal from their sexual violence** ***by \"dating\" guys like him.*** \n\nAnd he refuses to even *acknowledge* the multiple power imbalances he clearly gets off on. \n\nChubby women is his most legal kink. He doesn't say a single thing about their bodies that he likes, because he doesn't like them: he just looks down on them, and hopes they'll be too desperate and insecure to object to his glaring flaws.\n\nProblem is, adult fat women often don't actually *want* to be with grimy assholes who expect them to abide by an unspoken rule of \"you're fat and worth less, so you should be grateful I even want to fuck you, and not have any standards for me to meet\". \n\nJust because *he* doesn't value them doesn't mean they're actually going to \"try harder\" - aka, ignore that he's a restraining order waiting to happen, that he likes em young, and that he talks about women like fuckable cattle. \n\n(And whatever else is horrible behind the scenes that can't be gleaned from literally just his public Reddit activity over the last day or so.)\n\nGuess he's had more luck with sexually-abused teenagers.\n\nBan. \n\nHim.\n\nI'm not going back farther in his post history. If this isn't enough, staff just doesn't give a fuck.\n\nPTSD doesn't induce blameless *preferences* in grown adults for sex with insecure teens, insecure sexual abuse survivors, and insecure chubby women. That's not how this works. But it sure does get him misguided sympathy, and more access to sexually-abused teenagers than admitting the truth does.\n\nI used to be a mod on a large mental health support community too. About 1k concurrent users at every hour of the clock. We banned pedos like this regularly. They crawled in to vent about their disorder, which sometimes existed and sometimes didn't, played the victim for a while, then told young girls over DM to take their clothes off. \n\n> \"Hey, we *understand* each other soooo well, let me *help* you.\"\n\n**We're not letting this shit fly here, right?**",

The most devastating memory I have of her is her yelling at me for crying so loud to bother the neighbors. This was a couple months after my dad / her husband passed away. She often asked why I was so depressed when she was the one who lost everything. After that, I lost trust in her to show her my feelings. I would just cry alone at night whenever the feelings became overwhelming.\n\nSlowly over the past couple years since I've moved back home, I've been working things out with her and she's reflected and apologized for not understanding how to help me. It's improved a lot, but I still never asked her for support whenever I cry at night.\n\nTonight, after a decade, my mother hugged me the way I wanted her to while I sobbed my heart out. \n\nIt took some coaching to get here, but she did it.

    "selftext": "For a bit of context: I've experienced probable CSA along with repeated sexual trauma as an adult. I'm having a really hard time recently realising that it's so difficult for me to a) experience real sexual attraction at all, b) when I do experience it, experience it consistently, and c) decipher whether or not I'm attracted to someone.\n\nFor so much of my life I've found myself projecting my general feelings of sexual desire onto someone I wasn't actually attracted to, almost always someone who's expressed attraction to me - I think very often I misread the positive feelings of validation I get from knowing someone is into me as feelings of attraction on my part.\n\nI'll think I'm attracted to someone until I actually do anything physical with them, and then I realise I'm just not feeling it at all. But even then I'll experience the physical sensations of arousal, which is always confusing and distressing for me - it feels like it's happening against my will and makes me second-guess myself and wonder if actually I *am* attracted to the person, even though there are alarm bells in my head telling me, 'no! This isn't good for you!'\n\nThere's been one person in my life - an ex - who I'm sure I experienced real attraction towards, but even then it was inconsistent. We had a romantic/sexual relationship, and sometimes I experienced attraction so strongly and it felt so good, right, instinctive and natural (though not necessarily without PTS symptoms during sex), and other times it was just like the attraction vanished (I found this tended to be when I felt less emotionally connected to my ex and/or when my mental health was poorer).\n\nI suppose I just want to know if anyone here has similar struggles with sexual attraction? Does any of this sound familiar to you? And does anyone have any insight or any advice?\n\nI'm struggling so much with this at the moment and am so fearful that I'll never be able to experience normal/healthy attraction, it would just help to get a little bit more of an understanding of my feelings.",

I always thought I would hear \"Well there is no forensic evidence\", \"you're lying\" or \"you should have done xyz\". But what I read in that email broke my heart to pieces that none of those statements could have ever. For some context, I sent an email to his current employer to warn them of his past behavior that got him fired from a job before. In this job, he works with young women who are just barely adults and are so susceptible to abuse because their naive and just learning how to set boundaries and handle their alcohol, just like when I was raped by him. I was 18 and he was seven years older. Not saying that's what makes it rape, what made it rape was when I said no over and over and pushing him away throughout the assault, but it does show a power dynamic that gave him the ability to manipulate me into a position where we were alone and I had no way to escape. Anyway, this is what the email said. \n\n\"Thank you for taking the time to write this email, and for the bravery to send it. I imagine it is not easy to remember or recount these things, and appreciate you sharing for the benefit of others.¬†\n\n(His name) proactively disclosed this information to us when he began working for us, as well as its impacts on his work with (name of company). We keep it in consideration when thinking about his guiding work. It has felt important to us that (his name) has owned his mistake, and been transparent about his reflection and change. It also feels important to know, as you say, so that we would be attuned to anything that might suggest this is a pattern.¬†\n\nI really appreciate you coming forward, and wish you all the best in your journey.\" \n\nI have some seriously mixed feelings. I'm relieved to hear that he admits these things happen because now I don't have to constantly question whether I was crazy and making it up in my head. \n\nOn the other hand, they let him off pretty much scot-free because he seemed remorseful. He has never reached out to me to tell me he was sorry or pay reparations (because fuck yeah I'm demanding money after he fucked my life up into pieces) It just makes me sick. I don't want a single man to ever tell me again that rape accusations ruin a man's life. My rapist told a future employer, showed remorse (without it involving the actual victim), was given a pass for a \"mistake\" and was given a job at a prestigious guide company. Never want to fucking hear rape accusations ruin a man's life EVER AGAIN.\n\nOh and also they talk about being \"attuned to a pattern\". Something has to happen twice for it to be a \"pattern\". They care more about this man's guide career than the wellbeing and safety of any woman he comes into contact with.\n\nI right now just really need someone to explain how this could ever be ok. Maybe you've experienced the same thing. How do I ever have faith in our world or society again? How do I live with this?\n\nI'm so fucking triggered that I can't sleep",

I don't think there was a single church service where I didn't burst into tears because of the guilt I felt.\n\nWhen I was 13-14, I was sexually assaulted by a 16-17 year old friend of mine. She emotionally manipulated me into thinking she was the only honest one around me, and that I could only trust her. She touched me on my thighs, kissed me, held my waist, grabbed my face, used all of the physical touch she could to reassure me that she was the truthful one. And while I was uncomfy with it, she just laughed off my worries and said that \"it was fine.\" I think she might've done something even worse because of the nightmares I keep having, but I don't want to blame anyone for something they didn't do. Nonetheless, I have barely cracked the surface of what I do remember, and I don't feel comfortable sharing all of it.\n\nThese two traumatic things have lead to me having nightmares, dissossciating when I get touched, hear certain songs, having full on panic attacks when people try to hug me or hold my hand, not being able to focus sometimes cause my thoughts are so full, and even attempting suicide because of how painful it all is. When I talked about it with my therapist today, she said that I almost definitely have PTSD.\n\nHowever, while some of me is relieved that I actually have a name to put on what I'm going through, the rest of me feels as though I don't have enough trauma to have PTSD. I wasn't raped (at least, not that I can remember), and while I was sexually assaulted, I can't seem to tell myself that sexual assault is enough to be a cause by itself. I can believe it when other survivors of assault have PTSD, but I feel like my trauma isnt as bad as other people's. With the religious trauma, I feel as though it's less trauma and more of me just being dramatic. Can anyone else relate to this experience?",

    "title": "Traumatic birthing experience",
    "selftext": "Okay. So I have no idea where to start with this. I guess I should start with my pregnancy. I got pregnant last year, and me and my husband were ecstatic. But I had a very difficult pregnancy. I had pelvic pain that started around 8 weeks pregnant and continued up until I got induced. I got diagnosed with gestational diabetes, had to change my entire diet and then I was put on 9 units of insulin a day. And because of that, at 32 weeks pregnant, I had to go to the doctor and me and my daughter had to be monitored once a week. Then when I hit 36 weeks, I had to go 2x a week. And then I was induced at 39 weeks pregnant. When they were monitoring my blood pressure the day of my induction, they saw that it was high. They thought maybe it was nerves or something. So they tested my urine for protein, and it turns out I also had preeclampsia. And because of this, I had to be out on magnesium, which made my entire body hot and uncomfortable. I was already hooked up to so many things in my IV, the list just kept growing. They started the induction by using a foley balloon, wasn‚Äôt comfortable, but it was fine. Then when it fell out, I was dilated to 4 cm. Then they gave me a pill called cytotec to soften my cervix. Still wasn‚Äôt dilating much. Then they started me on pitocin. They told me that the magnesium and the pitocin would work against each other, and we were in for a long ride. I got some IV pain meds at some point. I still wasn‚Äôt dilating, and it had been about 12 hours in. I‚Äôm only at a 6. Doctor came in, and they had to turn my daughters head in my uterus by hand because she was facing up and she needed to be facing down. This was super painful. (I can‚Äôt remember if I had gotten an epidural yet or not) but they think they got it. And then I started dilating more and more over the course of what seemed like forever. It was over 48 hours from the start that they told me that I was at a 9. And my epidural would move to one side when I laid on my right side. So I would feel all of my contractions on my left side. And then when I laid on my left side, it fixed itself. So eventually, I started pushing at the 56 hour mark. My epidural wore off and I could feel almost everything. I pushed her out for the next 2 hours. I had to get a tiny episiotomy. And when she came out, everyone sighed a sigh of relief because it was over. But little did we know, it wasn‚Äôt over. They laid her on my chest, and the doctors were trying to get the placenta out. They took my daughter to the warmer, and my husband followed. They started to massage my uterus, but it hurt. Really really bad. It hurt worse than pushing my baby out. I asked the doctor ‚ÄúWhy are you doing it that hard?!‚Äù \nShe looked at me and said ‚ÄúTrust me, you want me to be doing this.‚Äù\n My mom is standing next to me looking worried as hell, which doesn‚Äôt help the fact that I‚Äôm freaking out. I then hear one of the doctors tell the other one something about me needing blood. I start freaking out, so I try to call my husband over, but I‚Äôm to weak and he can‚Äôt hear me. My father in law gets his attention, and he comes over to me. I tell him that I need blood, and he‚Äôs freaking out. \n\nAll of a sudden, I start to get really really sleepy. I ask my husband if I can go to sleep, the nurse said yes, and my mom said no. I tried to stay awake, my husband was trying to ask me questions to keep me awake. But I passed out. Well more like blacked out because my husband says my eyes were still open. He told me I threw up multiple times (I only remember 1 time). He told me that when he would try to talk to me, I would just stare at him with this blank look on my face and in my eyes. Like I wasn‚Äôt really there. There are a few things that I remember during my black out. I remember trying to answer people when they would talk to me. It felt like I was screaming, but nothing was coming out of my mouth. I remember seeing this new person in the room that wasn‚Äôt there before. Turns out he was like the head doctor or some shit. Then I saw that doctor doing an ultrasound because they put a balloon in my uterus to stop the bleeding and then I went back under. And then I started to come to when they hooked up the blood bag to my IV. I can‚Äôt remember when, but I‚Äôm pretty sure they gave me another epidural after I gave birth. They usually take out the catheter, but they left mine in. I remember being in the most immense amount of pain I‚Äôve ever been in. My mom had to help me shower because I could barely move. \n\nI know there are a lot of things that I‚Äôm leaving out, but I can‚Äôt really remember all of it. \n\nBut because of all this, I feel so messed up. Every time I watch a show or a movie where someone is giving birth, I cry. Every single time. And it freaks me out because I can talk about what happened to me, and not cry or have flashbacks (most of the time). But when I see a labor and delivery room on TV, I get scared and I cry. My friend gave birth 2 months after me, and I was gonna go visit her, but I got scared of going back to the hospital. Every time I have my period, the blood scares me and I think something is wrong with me again. I was afraid to go home after being in the hospital because I thought I was gonna die. I‚Äôm scared to get pregnant again. \n\nI feel like I can‚Äôt talk about this with anyone because they‚Äôll get annoyed and think I only want to talk about myself. I‚Äôm going to therapy, but I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs working yet. \n\nI also just lost almost all of my friends because I just had a very bad anxiety episode, and I actually let people see what I was going through. And they all bailed. So I‚Äôm afraid to open up to anyone. My husband is deployed now. So it‚Äôs just me and my daughter most of the time. \n\nI don‚Äôt know why I posted this.

She already knew what was waiting for me in that house and she let me run right past her into the thick of it. So yeh back to the time line, I dashed some bottoms on and ran across the road. I jumped the fence, sprinted through her front garden and straight into the front door. There he was. Hanging from the stars by a dog lead. I went to the kitchen to try and get a knife out but I collapsed. I couldn‚Äôt breathe, I couldn‚Äôt think, I couldn‚Äôt see, all I could do was hear my mum run in behind me and let out a scream I‚Äôve never heard before; this brought me back to reality.

It got to the point where I was chewing through the dog lead to try and get him down. The next thing I remember is the 2 policeman and 1 woman coming in and dragging me off him. I no longer speak to anyone from that side of the family, mainly my grandmother as she knew what she was setting me up to see.

I feel like my PTSD is so exhausting to me that I‚Äôd never want to push it on another person and I can‚Äôt think of many reasons why someone would take the time to understand and listen. It‚Äôs too much and it hurts. I feel like any chance at normalcy in my life has been destroyed and I have no idea how to rebuild. It feels very lonely\n\nEdit: Thank you all for your stories and advice. I just wanted to clear that I am in and have been in therapy for a while and it has been beneficial. I know I have a lot of trust issues to work out and hearing and reading everyone sharing and helping one another is the best thing I could‚Äôve asked for.",

You‚Äôre not even that attractive.‚Äù\n\nI am frequently fearful of being sexualized or liked by any one into women (male or female). I‚Äôve been sexually harassed and abused throughout my life and I run away from people who start liking me or sexualize me. I just don‚Äôt believe there are men (or women into women) who are attracted to me that won‚Äôt sexualize me. I mean my own dad had a crush on me and sexualized me (covert child sexual abuse).

    "selftext": "Edit: WARNING. This horror has become so apart of my life now that I‚Äôm use to it. And I forget that it really fucks people up just hearing about it it‚Äôs so traumatic. So just to prepare it‚Äôs about aggravated sexual assault with young children.\n\n\nOk so I found out this summer that my daughter who is 12 now was raped when she was 7 multiple times by my best friends husband. She told me that it finally stopped when she went to her best friend, (my best friends daughter) and asked her to tell her dad to stop. And then it didn‚Äôt happen again after that. I called my best friend and told her what I just found out. She was shocked and had doubts but said she would ask her daughter if she remembers that. She called me back an hour later crying cuz her daughter admitted and admitted he‚Äôs been raping her too starting when she was 5. His own daughter. she kicked her husband out and we called the police and I‚Äôm very happy to say after a week of working with the fbi. my friend got him to confess to it all while the fbi was listening. He‚Äôs now in jail waiting trial. Finding this all out has devastated our whole family. My husband had to come home early from his deployment we were so devastated. Months have gone by. I signed My daughter up for trauma counseling and they said after two sessions she doesn‚Äôt need trauma counseling. That she has moved on from this and is not traumatized by it. I asked my daughter if that was true and she said yes she just wants to move on and be a normal family again. I tell her ok and say help is there for you if you need it. I know this is what she wants and she doesn‚Äôt want this to be our life. but I‚Äôm having a hard time moving on and I don‚Äôt want to upset her. I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it. It doesn‚Äôt make sense. How the fuck did I not see this.. how did my friend. not see this. Our family have been so close for the last ten years. We get together 3 times a week for ten years. He was so fucking normal. How did I not see this monster who raped his 3 biological daughters now we know, and my daughter was next to me this whole time. We are both stay at home moms. Our kids are our everything. And these kids were always happy. We never once saw them in pain or saw bloody underwear or saw her crying around him. And they had to have been and I can‚Äôt move on from my confusion. How was this massive absolute horror happening for years and no one had a clue. And the guilt. My job is to protect her and I failed. No matter what I do for the rest of her life I have failed as her mother. I don‚Äôt know how to not have this be my life. I‚Äôm never gonna not be devastated or confused or fulled with so much guilt. Everyone says I need therapy but I don‚Äôt see the point. On the outside I‚Äôm normal. I‚Äôm ok I‚Äôm not crying on the couch for days. I‚Äôm playing with my kids and my husband and I are great. We really leaned on each other. He agrees with my daughter and wants to move on. I feel like my family is moving forward and I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it. Lucky I have my best friend still. And she is the only one who understand what I‚Äôm going through. But it‚Äôs not the same. She understands that for about two years of my life all my photos are ruined. Every photo from the time she was 6-8 all I think about is was this when she was raped? Is she in pain in this photo and she pretending? My friend understands this because all the photos for the last 18 years are ruined for her. And she feels all this guilt and more. I can‚Äôt imagine what she is going though. She lost her husband who she thought they ‚Äúwe‚Äôre happy‚Äù but realizes it was all a lie. She lost her dream house(that she closed on three days before we found out)She lost 2/3 of her income. And she has the guilt of this happening to her three daughters. She knows what I‚Äôm going through more then anyone. But what I‚Äôm going through doesn‚Äôt even compare to what she‚Äôs going though. I don‚Äôt want to complain to her about my family going back to normal and happy and I‚Äôm just frozen with my thoughts. \n\nOk so not I explained what I‚Äôm going though I was wondering if anyone has gone through something similar. And I‚Äôm wondering if me frozen with my horror in my head is just my normal and I need to except it.",

The last couple of years he became extremely close to this friend, he found a new lifestyle within him. He‚Äôs noticeably healthier thanks to their time spent together. My boyfriend always spoke highly of his friends mind, body and spirit. From the very beginning his friend was someone special to the point where he would introduce him as his angel to other friends. They spent countless hours together training on the road. They spent at least three sometimes four days out of the week training together. They have different routes to train on but last Thursday morning they decided to go train on the ‚Äúsafest route‚Äù to just loosen their legs a bit. It‚Äôs the same route they‚Äôve ridden on hundreds of times. A route where generations before them would train on. Even a route where my boyfriend would take me to ride on. It was like any other day. My boyfriend left the house around 7am to meet up with his group and they were on the road by 7:30. My boyfriend and two other friends escaped the peloton and were a few minutes ahead so my boyfriend decided to send a text to the rest of the group to let them know they slowed their rhythm to wait for them. As he was texting he got left a few meters behind and within that split second a car going more than double the speed limit estimated 200 km per hour veered past the white line of the highway and struck his friend. My boyfriend just heard an explosion looked up and saw his friend in the air and saw how he fell to the ground. His other friend was right next to him when it happened. They were in shock to say the least. He says he saw his friends soul leave his body in an unexplainable way he just saw a part of him leave. The car did not stop. The driver left with the bike incrusted in the car. I can‚Äôt even imagine the helplessness they felt in that very moment. Please respect cyclists. They‚Äôre practicing their passion. Keep your distance and respect their space. The pain in our hearts could have been completely avoided. It was a senseless murder. My heart aches for his family, friends, and my boyfriend. I wish I can take his pain and the image out of his head. Everything is very recent we can only take it a day at a time. Everything was taken within a split second. I‚Äôve mentioned seeking therapy for this traumatic experience but he‚Äôs not interested and insists in just living through the process on his own. He says it‚Äôs something that will never leave his mind. All I can do is be there for him and listen when he wants to talk. If there‚Äôs any tips on how I can help him deal with all he‚Äôs been through I‚Äôd appreciate it.",

I questioned what made this movie about human trafficking give me the feeling that something terrible was going to happen to me, yes, what happened in the movie can happen in real life, but I couldn't even imagine something like that happening to me, because I was fat. A year later, when I was in my twenties, I lost weight, and later, my life began to spiral, and that's when an older guy I met introduced me to cocaine. A few months later he said he is in love with me and asked how I felt about him, I told him he is a great guy, and a great friend, but I love him more like a brother, I apologized to him for not feeling the same, he said it‚Äôs okay, he understands, he‚Äôs cool with it and I don't have to be sorry. Nothing changed, we hung out twice and everything was okay and normal, on the third day I had such a terrible feeling but I didn't care because I needed cocaine to feel better, as I pulled into the parking lot to meet him, that feeling grew stronger so I asked him if he could come inside my car this time, but he said no because he had already taken it out of the bag and prepared it for me in his car. After I closed my window, I told myself to just relax, because today is no different from any other day, I didn't trust my words of reassurance, so I left my car doors unlocked and when I sat in his car I left the door open with my leg hanging out the door, he asked me to close the door, and I said I can‚Äôt because my car is unlocked, that I had to be able to attack whoever tried to steal it, he didn't ask me again, and that calmed me down. He waited until I was high off the cocaine to offer me the weed, I took a few hits and started choking, but he had a full bottle of water for me. As the drugs began to take effect, he started driving with my leg still hanging out the door, if I hadn't been so high, I would have thought to jump out of the car, but instead I shut the door. I have smoked weed before and I mixed it with cocaine, mixed drugs with other drugs and alcohol but none of them had an effect on me like this, something must have been in the water, I think I blacked out, when I opened my eyes we were on the highway, I asked where  are we were going, and then I fell asleep, I kept waking up and passing out. One of the times I woke up, I remember hearing him say that he sells woman and makes a lot of money, and then I fell back asleep, I slept the rest of the way, and when he woke me up, we were parked in someone's driveway. We walked into the house and there was a man standing there with a bottle of vodka, he ordered me to drink it, I said no, and then he and the guy who kidnapped me forced it down my throat. I remember the house, there was no furniture, and in the bedrooms there was a mattress in each room with a blanket and a pillow, but the mattress did not have a bed frame or any furniture. As the two guys spoke in the kitchen, I had the worst feeling I ever had in my life, the l human trafficking movie had crossed my mind, I thought I was never going see my family again, as high and intoxicated as I was, I had to try to find a way out of that house, because I didn't want to find out what might happen to me. I walked into one of the bedrooms to see if I could open the window just in case I needed to quickly escape, the curtain was dark, and the window was boarded up, I remembered when my kidnapper told me he loved me so I asked him if I could speak to him in private, I said it was really important because I can't keep this secret any longer than I have, he walked up to me and asked what is it? I said I lied when I told him I love him like a brother because I was afraid if I was honest with him, it would hurt me if I ever lost him. He asked if I was serious, I said yes and I hugged him tightly, he was totally shocked, excited, and then he told me he will be right back because he had to call off a deal he had made with his friend, I was standing in the empty living room when I heard a glass bottle shatter and I was afraid the friend of the guy who kidnapped me had killed him. When my kidnapper walked into the living room, unharmed, I felt so relieved, the other guy was also unharmed, as we were heading towards the door, I turned my head to the kitchen and saw the bottle of vodka shattered in pieces on the floor, and the guy seemed really angry, because he was silent when I said goodbye to him. On the car ride back to the Walmart where my car was parked, he told me that the deal he made with the guy was not his friend, it was his client, and the deal he made was to sell me, that man was going to buy me, with real money, buy me when I am a human being, not an object. He informed me that the house I had been taken to was the first stop, and I was going to be transported to another house somewhere else, I asked him which location and he said his client couldn't tell him because he knows me personally, it's a security thing to prevent him from coming back to pick me up if he changed his mind after I had been sold. He said he just wanted to be honest with me because he didn't want the beginning of our relationship to begin with a secret hidden from me, especially when it is a secret that involves me, I knew I had to watch what I say because my behavior and my actions were closely monitored, and I was petrified to be taken back to that house. I said, I forgive you baby, because I understand that some people just have to do whatever it takes to make money to support their families, I know that your father had passed away and you are trying to take care of your mother, I said this doesn't change my love for you, nothing ever will change that, he smiled and kissed me, he believed me, he held my hand, and I made sure I didn't let go while I was awake, I felt like it was the right time to close my eyes and sleep because I was still high and intoxicated, so I told him I was going to take a nap, he said, go ahead baby, I love you, and I said I love you too baby. When he woke me up, we were parked next to my car, still feeling petrified that he would take me back to that man's house, as he closely observed my reaction when I looked at my car, I had to keep playing it cool until I was safe, I said in a funny way, wow, nobody stole my car when the doors are all unlocked, he laughed, and then we hugged and kissed each other goodbye, I sat inside my car, acting like I was doing something as I was waiting for him to drive away, and after he drove off, I broke down in tears and thought of all the girls in the world who are victims of human trafficking, all the girls who are being held captive, my heart breaks for them and my heart goes out to them all. I know that I have no right to say that I know how it feels to be a victim of human trafficking, but I felt the terror that comes with it, the fear that I will never see my family again, and the end of my life as I knew it before. This was by far the scariest and most traumatic day I had ever experienced in my life, please do not tell me that I am lucky to have escaped, or that this makes me a brave person because I am not. I feel disgusted with myself and I feel so incredibly guilty for what I said to him, I hate myself for feeling so petrified that I had gone so far as to pretend to be okay with the fact that he sells innocent woman to make money, I wish I said screw my life and stood up for all the victims of human trafficking, I am so sorry. How to identify a human trafficking house? There are high security devices, non-transparent windows, boarded up windows, bars on windows, barbed wire and surveillance cameras in the work or living areas.",

Suggesting others commit suicide will result in an immediate ban.\n\nIf you see any suicidal posts, please report them to us.  While the mods are spread across different timezones, we do have the ability to review every post that comes in.\n\nIn the spirit of mod transparency, if we see a user is posting something with suicidal or serious self-harm tendencies, we will take the following actions:\n\n* we will inform reddit, using the report function. Which you are also welcome to do as well, in addition to reporting to us, so that we can react ASAP.\n\n> Reddit has partnered with [Crisis Text Line](https://www.crisistextline.org/) to provide redditors who may be considering suicide or seriously hurting themselves with support from trained Crisis Counselors. If you‚Äôre worried about someone, you can let us know by reporting the specific post or comment that worried you and selecting, *Someone is considering suicide or serious self-harm*. After you let us know, we‚Äôll reach out (confidentially) to put them in touch with Crisis Text Line‚Äôs trained Crisis Counselors.\n\n* the post will be removed, per the recommendation of the [National Suicide Prevention Alliance](https://www.nspa.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NSPA-Guidelines-Responding-to-Suicidal-Content-Online.pdf)\n\n> \"Unsafe content can have a negative and potentially dangerous impact on others, and should be removed\"\n\n* And we will follow up with a public reply for OP, as well as anybody from the community who may come across said post:\n\n> Hey /u/[OP], we‚Äôve seen your post and we‚Äôre worried about you.

This is important to what I say in this post.\n\nWhen I was 16, I was raped by a cisgender woman. Multiple times. She saw me as a man, and tried to convince me that I was one. She was my only friend at the time. I knew that what she was doing was abusive, but I did not stop her from assaulting and raping me for a few reasons:\n\n1) I did not want to lose my only friend.\n\n2) I felt that if I used my superior physical strength to push her off of me, I would be easily framed as an attacker, as someone who would be considered a man in court.\n\nI hate that my attacker was female. Had she been male, I would have more people willing to support me. It is so tiring having to deal with people thinking that the damage done to me was less, both physically and mentally, than it would have been if my attacker had been a male. I‚Äôm tired of being told I am ‚Äújust lucky for getting sex‚Äù or other things along those lines. \n\nI have also been sexually assaulted over 40 times since by other cisgender women.\n\nI hate that had I reported, people would care even less because in most places cis women aren‚Äôt even considered to be capable of rape.\n\nI hate that I could even be framed for it. I was forced to penetrate. I hate dealing with the paranoia that if I say something she would turn it around on me calling me the rapist because I was the one penetrating. \n\nI often find myself wishing that she was a man, and I feel awful for that. I see and hear the difficulties that victims of men face. I don‚Äôt want to downplay their pain in any way, shape, or form. And yet..I remain jealous. So infuriatingly jealous. They have support groups, legal backing, so much more representation and acknowledgement.. \n\nI wish that I had somewhere I could relate to others. For me, going to a support group would mean going to a men‚Äôs support group, which misgenders me. Going to a women‚Äôs support group would mean being surrounded by people who are seen as potential rapists and predators by my PTSD, and who‚Äôs experiences I cannot relate to as someone who was forced to penetrate..\n\nThen there is also the shame, transphobia, racism..everything else that would be in my way of finding help and support.\n\n\n\nIf you read this far, thank you.

I'm really sorry if it makes you uncomfortable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst, sometime before 5 I was repeatedly sexually abused/assaulted. I don't know what actually happened, I don't remember any of it. I just know that by the time I was 5 I had knowledge of what porn is and what sex toys are/how to use them, and I have memories of me asking my friends if they knew what grown men looked like naked. The only reason I know anything happened for sure is due to another situation I'll explain later on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I was 6, my friend started doing things to me like looking up my skirt and trying to stick her hands in my underwear, to the point of chasing me into rooms when I would try to run away from her. I would have to block myself in closets and bathroom stalls and scream at the top of my lungs to get her to go away. I feel bad now because I know that she was probably being abused at home, but idk it scared me at the time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFrom the time I was little to until I was about 9, I couldn't go to any sort of family reunion without get sexually harassed/abused. It was mostly by older, distant relatives who I didn't know very well, but there was always something happening to me (though it never really went as far as full-blown rape or even really assault). I would tell my mom, sometimes in tears, and she would just brush it off as them making me (an already squeamish, shy girl) uncomfortable when they would literally be touching me or flashing me or sticking their crotches in my face. It was disgusting. My narc uncle also groomed me and got me to touch him sexually when I was about 9-10.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn a trip my family took to a campground when I was almost 7, I kept following this group of older boys (about 9-12) around. I thought they were cool and they mostly took me under their wing, until one day three of them and I were looking for frogs in the forest and they assaulted me. The only way I got them to stop was by peeing myself, which got on their hands. It made me feel proud then for defending myself but grossed out and humiliated as I got older.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I was 10, I was groomed online by someone whose real age I still don't know (first they said they were 11, then 16, then idk). They would pressure me into sending them sexual things and acting out scenarios with them through text and this online game we met on (not gonna say the actual name cuz it's embarrassing). The scenarios would involve sexual assault and pedophilia and made me uncomfortable but they would just keep asking and saying they would report me until I did. Finally I broke it off and they threatened to doxx me. They sent me my own ip address over and over before I blocked them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I was 11-12, I made friends with this kid in my class. I felt bad for him because nobody else would be his friend, though now I can see that was for a good reason. He had an IEP due to his Conduct Disorder (and was held back two years) so he got a pass out of gym and got the teacher to let me skip gym as well to \"study\" with him. For some reason, we would be unsupervised for long periods at a time (I think because the school thought it would be fine if I was there since I was a good student), and during those times he would repeatedly harass me and threaten me.\n\nHe would make me play computer and board games where he would make his character rape my character, he would try to force me to touch him sexually and he would touch me over my underwear/clothes. The kid would also follow me around and try to get me to have sex with him, whispering in my ear and disrespecting my personal space even in front of all my friends. He spread rumours that we were having sex and told me to just get it over with since everybody thought so already. He also said that none of the teachers would believe me if I told them what was going on because he was technically disabled. I'm almost certain now that the kid was some sort of psychopath.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm 15 now. I just want to be okay. This isn't even all of it, there are more instances of me being harassed. I live in a big city so I've been stalked/followed, I've had creepy encounters on the street, I've been groped in passing. I also got a job this past summer and was harassed by my boss at the job.\n\nAll of these instances of abuse have really affected the way I see my body (I'm completely afraid of/repulsed by it lol), my ability to form new relationships, and just the way I see the world/other people. I'm also terrified of most men.\n\n**I don't know why I'm not human to so many people. I don't know why so many people think I don't deserve to be safe in my own body.

When we talk torture we're not talking beatings but as being treated as a \"mutt\", eating off the floors, leashes, and a lot of other shitty stuff.\n\nI've known this, have been there through highs and lows and still love her so finally asked her to marry me. Though she said yes, she's also terrified of me living with her and seeing her is her \"worst\" state (she unfortunately doesn't feel safe with others in her living space as her ex invaded her old apt). Until now, I've only interacted with her flashbacks and dissociation over the phone because she let me help but couldn't stand me in her space during those times. I understand.\n\nBut now that we're planning on living together she's starting to worry about how it'll go down when I inevitably live in the same space as her. I'm more than happy and honored to be able to help and support her. My own therapist is advising that I don't treat her as a patient but as a loved one. I get it. My fiance doesn't expect me to be there for her as well.\n\nBut I want to be prepared for the worst. Google is terrible by just saying talk gently and be there. But what are some of your personal ways of defusing or coming out from episodes?\n\nI'm thinking of things like sensory toys and weighted blankets stationed around the house, ice packs, some bookmarked animal documentaries.\n\nBut what are some others? She and I are both open to trying stuff out until something that works comes up.\n\nTell me what your dream set up would be for a partner and your home. I want to make a space where she is free to go through an episode with no judgement, but abundant resources to overcome the inevitable flashbacks and dissociation happenings.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nUPDATE: I'm saying this often but you survivors are my heroes. You've been through things no human should ever experience yet here you are living, breathing,  TEACHING me. You're likely sick of hearing that you're strong but holy smokes you all are so so so so phenomenal. Really hope the present and future holds the best for you. \n\nUPDATE 2: while I very much appreciate all the compliments and thanks for being there for my fiance, I don't feel comfortable taking credit. 1. All humans should make an effort to learn ways of helping others and 2. I wouldn't have been able to learn and care for folx if all you survivors (including my fiance) didn't speak up, advocated for yourselves, and shared a piece of you with others.

    "title": "PTSD from riots. Feeling so alienated",
    "selftext": "I live in a city where there was significant rioting at the end of May. I was present some nights of protesting and rioting, and live in the neighborhood where riots occurred. the area I live in is also low income, has a lot of homeless people and encampments that the cops keep sweeping. It's been pretty miserable and things are only getting worse. Ever since the riots I've been on edge waiting for there to be more protests around me.\n\nI live near a hospital with a helipad and when the helicopters get too loud I freak out. Last night a shit ton of cop cars were lined up outside my house getting ready to arrest protesters. I could hear them joking around in their cars from my porch. I can see everyone around me on edge. At some point it hit me how fucking hard it is to live this way.\n\nThe protesters never made me feel unsafe. Even people rioting and looting didn't worry me that much. It was the fucking nazis running around and the cops tear gassing me and my friends and laughing while they bulldoze tents.\n\nAnd I have to go about my life like everything is normal. I work as a college TA and I feel so disconnected from everyone. It feels like they've been living in a completely different city from me these last three months. I can't even give a fuck about COVID anymore. I feel like I couldn't even begin to tell most people everything that happened to me this summer. Like they wouldn't even believe me or if they did they'd be horrified.\n\nEDIT: Thank you everyone for the kind words and advice. I was hesitant to post because I know that the critics of these protests can be quite loud, but I'm very pleased that there were very few ass holes (one got deleted by a mod before I even saw it, thanks for that). I'm feeling much better than I did when I made this post, I was really shaken by all the cops outside my house and once I was able to be alone with my thoughts I lost it for a bit.\n\nRE: Therapy I definitely have reservations about it for a number of reasons but I'll definitely be looking into some work I can do on my own and possibly EMDR since I've had it recommended before. I've said this to people before but as horrific as things have been I am still SO lucky to have a safe home to live in, stable income, and a very strong support network of close friends. I had a few IRL friends reach out to me because they could tell I was struggling.\n\nI do hope that reading this gave some people who weren't close to any riots some perspective on how damaging the current state of affairs is. I am not the only one who feels this way. I'm white, I've only had to experience this kind of violence very recently, I can't imagine growing up with this level of fear.",

However, my manager part (Internal Family Systems Part) is very organized, impatient, efficient, logical and perfectionistic. My manager comes out frequently when I need to protect myself and take control of myself and surroundings. At this time in my life, I notice I feel triggered and unsafe around people and especially those who are supposed to take care of me when they are disorganized and unpredictable. I need to know they have my back and can catch me if I fall. I crave calm, logical, organized, and predictable people. I cannot stand when I am around people who are indecisive and make decisions in a flash based on their feelings. I notice I feel a lot of anxiety in relationships with people like this as it triggers my insecure attachment. \n\nI have learned that people with a traumatic background often benefit from structure and stability to assist in regulating emotions. Recently, I have had some bad experiences with my surgeon and therapist that makes me distrust their expertise. They both are laid back, unorganized and forgetful. When I notice these traits, my manager comes out and takes the role of being the organized person. I feel stressed and hypervigilant doing this as it is not even who I truly am at my best as an ENFP. I feel annoyed and impatient around them as they appear lazy and passive. I feel like I do not trust them to take care of me due to their qualities such as not calling me when they said they would. I know this is definitely related to my trauma background where my abusers were often unpredictable and you never knew what their next move would be so you had to be on edge and hypervigilant. I wonder if I should switch therapists because when I take on the manager role, it gets in the way of me doing EMDR because my exile has a hard time coming out when my manager is so present. \n\nI know no one is perfect and they have traits that very logical people lack such as gentleness and warmth. But I really think I thrive when people can balance me out and I feel safer when my doctors are more logical and organized. I also know once I heal more from my trauma,  I will be able to feel less triggered and unsafe around people with these qualities. \n\n I really struggle with working with people like this!

Sometimes, when someone offers you ice cream, you become SO AFRAID and you don‚Äôt know why. So afraid that you can‚Äôt think. Sometimes ice cream makes you want to throw up. You want run away at the sight of ice cream. You want to CRY because that‚Äôs how scared you are. Your brain goes, what am I doing?! I like ice cream. I‚Äôve been craving ice cream. And yet here I am, running out of the door when I see ice cream. Shoving it back in your face.

I (enby24) always knew I grew up different but I just realized a lot of my mothers \"lessons in self love\" were abuse. Her teaching me how to/having me help her pick out lingerie and taking pictures of her wearing it wasn't okay at all. Especially not for a child who was under the age of 10 (I don't even remember the exact age it's just something I remember growing up doing) and I always thought that was totally normal. When she abandoned me at 10 it only got worse. My father began hyperfixating on me. When we argued he would say \"were just like an old married couple\" and he would always refer to me as \"his little house wife that would never leave him\" and always buy me really nice gifts and asked for Goodnight kisses and lot of hugs, always wanted me to sit on his lap ect ect. When I was 15 he started calling me sexy and started stalking me (I once caught him outside my friends house and he would sit in the parking lot across from my job and watch me, sit in the school parking lot for hours, tried to put cameras in my bedroom and bathroom) and used to say he wanted to lock me in a tower so I could never leave him and I always felt like he wasn't really joking. he never did/asked for any of those things from my 4 brothers, and in fact told them all many times he wanted to send them to military school/couldn't wait for then to move out. It finally elevated when I was 18 and he told me he was in love with me. Had written me a love note and told me how amazing and incredible I was and how I would be the perfect wife. I ran away and never came back. But now in relationships I realize whenever I start feeling sad/down/like the person I'm with might want to leave me I realize that I get really desperate for sex to the point where if I get turned down I break down for days, convinced I'm unlovable and useless. I'm in therapy for all this but honestly? Some days are just tough and I just realized this weekend that all of that was sexual abuse and that the periods I go through of being hyper sexual are a result of that.

Try and pull yourself back into the world around you through the connection.** \n4. **Smell a strongly scented item, like peppermint oil or a scented candle. If possible choose a scent that reminds you of a pleasant place or memory. Try and reconnect with your senses and your environment by experiencing the strong smell. Notice what the smell makes you think about or feel in your body.**\n5. **Laying under an ‚Äúanxiety‚Äù blanket or weighted blanket can be a stimulating somatic experience. If you don't have one, try lying under several heavy blankets to slow your heart rate and calm down.** \n6. **Rub a mentholated lotion around the neck and chest when you notice panic starting. There are many brands like Blue Stop ‚Ñ¢ that are marketed for arthritis and muscle pain. The cooling sensation can help you reconnect with your body and slow your heart rate.** \n7. **Wrap a frozen bag of peas in a towel and put it across your forehead and eyes. This will activate the body‚Äôs natural ‚Äúdive response‚Äù.  When the head becomes colder than the rest of the body, your body thinks it is diving into deep water and will slow your heart rate and relax muscles to save oxygen.**\n\n# Mind\n\n1. **Make a mantra about the fear, negative belief, or trigger for your panic or dissociation. This should be something that reminds you that you are ok and that the belief about the trauma is not true right now. Eg. ‚ÄúI am safe, I am free‚Äù or ‚Äúmy past is not my future‚Äù or ‚ÄúI am loving, I am loved‚Äù. Repeat the mantra to yourself when you notice the distressing belief taking hold.** \n2. **Break down what you are currently doing into a series of steps, and repeat back to yourself the steps of what you are doing in a deconstructed way. Remember that you are competent and that these are easy things to do. Eg. ‚ÄúI am turning on my blinker at the intersection‚Äù or ‚ÄúI am putting peanut butter on the bread‚Äù.**\n3. **Go through your phone or a mental calendar of future events and realize that this moment is just one part of the rest of your life. Go through your schedule and realize that right now is just one minute of the next hour of the next day of the next week of the next year. Think about things that you are excited to do in the future. Think of ways you can prepare for them.** \n4. **Try and put your finger on the exact emotions that you are feeling. ‚ÄúOverwhelmed‚Äù or ‚Äúfreaked out‚Äù are not emotions. Try and specifically describe your experience. Ask yourself if your current reality necessitates this experience. Try and discover if you are feeling scared, vulnerable or angry in this moment. If so, try and figure out who or what you are directing these emotions toward.**  \n5. **The ‚Äústuck memory‚Äù of the trauma remembers the muscle groups that were tightened during the trauma. It remembers the way that you wanted to move your body's posture to protect yourself. Most importantly it remembers the way that you felt about yourself during the trauma. you may have wanted to curl up into a ball or stand up and fight. You may have thought that you were dirty, weak, small, or foolish. remind yourself that the traumatic belief you had about yourself during the trauma is not true. Also, try and move your posture into the opposite position the trauma belief makes it want to move into. Relax all muscle groups that want to tighten.**\n\n# Soul \n\n1. **Think of an object or a place that you find beautiful. Look up a picture on your phone if you have access to one. Think about what you find beautiful about this object or place. Notice all of the things that you appreciate about the beauty of this place or object. Eg. pictures of the beach or a famous painting or sculpture** \n2. **Think about someone you love and feel safe with.  Think about what it is that you love about them. Think about this person and try and cultivate compassion for them. Feel yourself move from isolation to connection, and fear to compassion. If a word or phrase jumps out at you that represents this relationship to you, then repeat it to yourself in your head. Eg. Trust, kindness, safety**\n3. **Think of your whole life like a giant web. Imagine yourself at the center and the strands of the web as your connections to others. Think of all the people that you love. Imagine where they are right now and when you will see them again. Imagine that the strings of the web run out from you to where your loved ones are in the world..** \n4. **Creativity requires us to get outside our own immediate experiences and reconnect with our resilient self. Draw a picture with anything you have, pen and napkin or toe in the dirt. Think about how you want to feel and try and express that feeling however you can. Hum a tune or sing a song if that is more appealing to you. When you feel that you are out of the immediate experience of the panic or dissociation, do a more complex creative activity that you find healing. Bake a cake, paint pictures, write a short poem, or make yourself do a small home improvement project. Reconnecting with our creative image and spatial processing part of the brain allows us to draw new connections and create new learned experience that helps us process trauma.** \n5. **Go to a space that you find calming, spiritual, or that feeds you in a personal way. Walk in the woods, sit by a lake, bird watch, attend a religious service, watch a theater piece, or go for a scenic drive. Find a space where you feel like you are calm, safe, and can start to be yourself again.**  \n6. **Try to find your center or mindful self during the experience of the panic or dissociation. Think about the essence, psyche, or soul of yourself as a person. Feel how this anxiety, panic and dissociative episode is holding you back from being present like you would like to be. Ask yourself, what in me do I need to leave behind so the rest of me can become what I want to be? Ask yourself, what enlarges what I am, and what restricts who I am? Visualize yourself taking off or moving away from the anxiety experience. Realize that it is hurting you and not helping you right now. Try and feel yourself leave some of it behind so your mindful self can become more present.** \n\n[https://www.gettherapybirmingham.com/post/20-fast-interventions-for-panic-and-dissociation](https://www.gettherapybirmingham.com/post/20-fast-interventions-for-panic-and-dissociation)",

    "title": "To the guy on here that posted that anyone with non combat related ptsd are pansies and should stfu, you are wrong and here is why",
    "selftext": "(This is super long)\n\nYou know, I've never fully revealed on here why I have PTSD. I've just given the gist. But let me tell you my story, and why don't you tell me if I can \"Just get over it\" and \"my ptsd is not real ptsd\"\n\nMy story starts with my high school sweetheart. Together since 16 and we married as soon as I turned 18. But when we got married, things started to change. Little things. He would become jealous when he wasn't previously a jealous person. He started to be controlling. Then he started to get angry. Then one day, I don't remember the reason, but it was when the physical violence started. He choked me until I passed out. I thought maybe this was a one time thing. But no. Stupid scared and naive 18yo me wanted to make a marriage work. His jealously became worse and he stared to hit me when we argued, over the most trivial things I might add (like who ate the last doughnut), he would hit me for that too. He'd grab my arm so hard there'd be bruises where his fingers were pressing. He constantly tried to convince me that we should kill ourselves together. \n\nThen, 3 months into our marriage, I had the worst experience of my life. He had gotten mad at me for spending too long over at a friends house and accused me of seeing another guy there. So he put me in \"the hole\". In our house, there was a loose board in the stairs that you could pry open, revealing the ground underneath the stairs. He put me in the hole and the other stair boards were nailed in, I was too short to reach the lose one. He left me in there for 3 days with no light. He would only open the board to throw water and granola bars at me, and occasionally try to urinate on me. I sat in that hole in the corner for 3 days and nights. I screamed but no one could hear. Finally, he pulls up the board and pulls me out. He tells me to get cleaned up and hurry, I have 10 minutes. It turns out, my parents had just called him and said they were coming to stay the weekend with us. I was too scared to tell them and I am ashamed of that. \n\nThe night they left, I asked him if he would get off of the computer so I could use the phone to call my (gay) best friend (we had dialup). He then became angry. He flipped the computer table and it fell to the ground. He accused me of cheating on him with my gay friend, that he wasnt really gay and that we had been having an affair and playing him for a fool all along.\n\nI had never seen him this angry, so I ran to the bathroom and locked myself in. Thankfully my cell phone was in there and I called my gay friend (who lived a block away) And i told him that it was bad and was scared and to get a friend (Brad) to come over and help me. Well husband broke down the bathroom door (he was 6'5 250lbs) and pulled me out to the living room. He told me to sit on the couch while he went to get something. I ran to my room but he caught me before I got there. He dragged me on the floor by my hair back to the living room. He had gotten a shotgun and he pointed it at me and he told me that he was going to kill me and then kill himself. At this moment, (I found out later that my gay friend and Brad had peeked through the window and saw husband with the gun) Brad opens the door really fast. Husband happened to be standing close enough to it that it hit him in the back and it knocked him over. Brad took me by the hand and we left. I have never seen my husband again.\n\nSo there is my story of why I have PTSD.  I want you to tell me now if my PTSD isn't \"real\" PTSD because I wasn't in combat.\n\nTo the guy who posted, you are a fool. Combat veterans arent the only people in the world that have PTSD. And for you to make a post suggesting that anyone with \"childhood trauma\" doesn't really have PTSD and should just deal with their problems like adults, you make me sick. ",

I paid $171 out of pocket just to see her. I asked her ‚ÄúDid I just spend close to $200 just to be told you can‚Äôt help me?‚Äù. I think she was going to pocket my money but I walked out and I asked for a refund. I feel soooo defeated. I‚Äôve been struggling for years and I cannot afford a specialist. All of the psychiatrists (well 4 psychs, 3 therapists and 1 specialist) I‚Äôve seen since I was 22 did not take insurance. They said the insurance companies caused so many problems that they just stopped accepting it. Something has got to give. I‚Äôm 31 and my trauma has only been compounded by a recent violently abusive relationship. I have no one to help me or even a shoulder to cry on. This is exhausting. I did make a call to a ketamine clinic and so I‚Äôm hoping I can maybe get some help there because as long as my insurance is accepted my sessions will be way cheaper than I expected. But out of pocket is over a $1000. Idk I just needed to vent and cry a little. The American health care system is more than a joke, it‚Äôs a scam. ",

    "selftext": "Hi all - To keep it short, I had to save my young son (7) from a rogue wave set that tore him off the beach in Hawaii a couple years ago. It took \\*every. single. bit\\* of everything I had to do it. At one point I made my peace and was on my way to accepting that I wasn't gonna make it, but I would be damned if he wasn't.   \n\n\nWe both made it out. I don't really know how, but we did, and neither of us needed medical treatment, but I wasn't ok. Immediately I knew I wasn't ok.   \n\n\nI have been on meds (the nightmares, oh my god the nightmares), I have done EMDR, and both have helped, but it always feels like it wears off.   \n\n\nI don't want to leave my house. Hell, I don't want to leave my room. I am constantly just waiting for the next bad thing.   \n\n\nI feel like my friends and family, who have been very supportive, esp my loving wife, are growing tired of me. But I can't explain it, I don't want to do anything. I seem to be slipping into lower and lower power states, where normal things seem too hard to deal with, and I put off things until they are either about to go wrong, or right after. I can't seem to do anything that would \"save\" me from additional issues, money, time, whatever - and the worst part is I KNOW I need to do them and its like I handcuffed.   \n\n\nThen on top of it all, I feel like a fraud. Like a charlatan. There are so many persons that are fully entitled to their PTSD due to the horrific things that have happened to them. I feel so stupid for mine, like its stolen valor.   \n\n\nWTF do you do? How do you motivate? How do you go through this world and not see it like this anymore? ",

Really no big deal at all other then I feel like I wasted the last few years. As im sure many of you can relate to having, I'm having a particularly tough day. Just a lot of thinking, a bit too much honestly. Mostly about how I'm not happy with who I've become. What I've done. The choices I've made, & am I really allowed to be upset about the consequences of my own actions? When it hit me.\n\nBy the end of this year I will have lived more years **with** PTSD then without. That thought killed me. I've always had trouble with remembering a lot of what happened before the fire. The good & the bad. Better or worse. I know these are repressed memories & not forgotten. That they can be gotten back. \n\nYet I'm starting to feel like I've forgotten who I was before I had PTSD. I can feel these beautiful moments & old version myself slipping away, & it feels as if I'm holding on to them by barbed wire. I do everything I can to pull them close enough only to find they're to shredded to make out. & It feels as if I did more damage to myself then good.
