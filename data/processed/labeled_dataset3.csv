post_06175,"my best friend raped a girl and i turned in evidence against him throwaway account i just need to tell someone this because it’s been eating me up inside. sorry for bad punctuation 

i was 18 at the time and he was 19 both of us are male. i’ve known him since i was 8 and he was like my brother. 

we decided to throw a house party with around 20 other teenagers around our age. we had alcohol and weed just normal party substances. i didn’t drink any or smoke any of the weed because i was the designated driver for a few people. around 11pm he came up to me and told me he was going to get lucky tonight. i didn’t think much of it because he was pretty decent at picking up girls. 

i said my goodbyes to everyone around midnight and gathered the group of people i needed to take home and piled them up into my truck. after i got done dropping people off it was around 2am. i went home and went to sleep. 

the next day my phone was blowing up and people were texting me that my friend had raped a girl and everyone at the party had to write police statements. my friend got arrested but got released on bail after a few weeks. i went over to his house to see what had happened because everyone else couldn’t give me an answer. 

he pulled out his phone and showed me a video of him doing it. he kept saying that she was lying and that she had asked for him to do it. i watched him rape this poor girl who was underage. i played along but inside i felt so sick. i stayed the night at his house that night and while he was asleep i sent the video of him doing that to my phone and then i deleted the message so he wouldn’t know. 

when i got home that next day i sent the video to a old phone that i had and i turned it into the police station. i told them everything i knew and i told them that there was more evidence on his phone. 

he got sentenced a few months later to almost 20 years for statutory rape. i don’t know if what i did made any difference. 

i wouldn’t have left that party if i knew that underage girl was there. i should’ve checked peoples age but i didn’t. i should’ve offered everyone there a ride because maybe then she wouldn’t have been there that night. 

there’s so many things i could’ve done but i didn’t do and it hurts me because something horrible happened to that girl.",0
post_05761,"i hope you are having a good day hi. i create this post to vent. i'm feeling a little sad and have no one to talk to. i want to apologise for my bad grammar/writing first, english is not my first language. i don't really know where to start but lately i've been feeling sad because i feel like my dad care more about them than about me. 

i truly don't know where to start, i feel confused about my own feelings. my dad, my step-mom and my half brother went on a trip without telling me. i was at a friend's house when they left, they only inform me once they land. even though this is not the first time it still hurts a bit i guess. i'm 16  and this has happened since i was around 12. my mother died of cancer when i was 8. my dad remarried 3 years after. 

if you ask me more about my dad, i truly think he is a nice dad. before he remarried, we went out a lot. because i was very sad of my mother's death, he cheers me up in a lot of ways until i'm finally okay. i can't describe it but he is a really good dad and i still think he is. 

growing up to be a teenager, i'm more like the introverted kid. i prefer to be at home most of the time. i don't really have that much friends, i only have two or three that is really close to me. btw my mom's family doesn't approve of my parent's marriage. before they have me, they doesn't talk to me parents. but now they only talk because of me (i'm the first granddaughter). even so, it's really hard to be around them when all they do is talk bad about my dad. they badmouth my dad literally to me since i was a kid. so that's why i don't really enjoy being with them.

what i mean by 'this is not the first time' is, they often leave me home alone when they went on trip (or if they just go out to the beach, mall, etc). the first time i deny them was because i was feeling sick and just wanted to spend the day at home and that's just how they started to leave me alone at home. my relationship with my step-mom isn't really good. we didn't talk much. but she often scold me when i was a kid, though.

i also spent the previous two years, christmas and new year's alone.

that's all. sorry again for the bad writing.",0
post_01147,"embarrassed 15f i went to the mental hospital for a couple of days and told them that i felt better(i was lying and was trying to get tf outta there).

now my momma boyfriend has to watch me because she doesn’t trust me being alone.

i don’t want someone watching me just because i want to hurt myself. and my family are constantly checking on me now.

this is making me want to do it even more, but my mom removed the pills and knives.

i will do my second attempt which will be drowning in the ocean and i can’t wait to do.

been fantasizing about drowning for a while now, my time is so close…😪

post_01162,"every time something slightly bad happens i lose my mind i'm 44 and have had suicidal thoughts since my early teens. i also have boat loads of anxiety. i've never acted on any of the suicidal thoughts, but if something bad happens i get really crazy.

today, i got a speeding ticket for speeding in a school zone. first ticket in 20 years. i just wasn't paying attention to how fast i was going. after the cop gave me a ticket and left i just lost it. hitting myself in the head hard over and over kinda crazy. walked down the street in a t-shirt in 15f weather kinda crazy. the emotions and feelings just become too much and i absolutely detonate. incidents like this have happened throughout my adult life, maybe as a kid too who knows. if i feel like i did something wrong, feel embarrassed, i just want to die. while these incidents are kinda rare, i'm starting to worry that i may actually do something one of these days. suicide is not an option for me right now because my mother is still alive, but i worry that i may blow up and do it anyways. i don't want that to happen.

how do you guys handle when the feeling is really strong? i tried breathing but that didn't do anything. i've calmed down some, but am still in a really poor mental state.",1

post_07483,"feeling lost and alone, can't find a way out i don't know where to begin. every day feels like a battle i'm losing more and more. i feel like i'm suffocating in my own thoughts, trapped in a world that's filled with darkness. it's like no matter how hard i try, nothing ever goes right.  i've been struggling with feelings of worthlessness and despair for as long as i can remember. it's like a heavy weight on my chest that never goes away. every smile i force feels like a lie, and every step i take feels heavier than the last.  i don't have real friends; i don't think anyone truly understands me. my family is distant and doesn't seem to see the pain i'm in. i try to reach out, but it feels like my words fall on deaf ears. the loneliness is suffocating, and the silence is deafening.  it's hard to find a reason to keep going when all i see is darkness ahead. i have moments where i just want to end it all, to make the pain stop once and for all. the thought of disappearing from this world seems like the only way out of this endless cycle of despair.  i'm tired of pretending that everything is okay when it's not. i'm tired of feeling like a burden to everyone around me. i just want the pain to end, but i don't know how. i need help, but i don",0
post_02831,"i have never felt truly safe. i’m 25m, about to turn 26 in a week. i never really had a good lease on life. my parents had a very hostile relationship and split when i was 6. they had another lengthy custody battle some years later that was very traumatic. i was bullied in school for being big, i was emotionally abused and neglected by my entire family, and i never really had any friends. as i grew older i started to come out of my shell more. i was optimistic, even cheerful and excited about my future. i believed in the good in others even when i didn’t have a reason to.

as a teen, i still had no real friends except for one. she really helped me get through those years. and those years were not so good either. i was in a relationship that was toxic and led to me being sa’d, i was groomed by anonymous people online to exposing myself, and i was severely depressed at my job as a dishwasher. but still, into adulthood i was optimistic. i was beginning to find my passion for art and was excited to get started on building a life for myself.

my early adulthood wasn’t so bad. i was living away from home and actually found a group of lifelong friends. likeminded people that treated me with empathy that i was so unfamiliar with. but the stress and depression lingered, and i fell into a horrible drinking habit that has persisted to this day. once i graduated i had to move back home. there i had virtually no one. i wanted to leave as soon as i came back so i saved a little money and hiked the pct for a month. that was the best time of my life. but all my problems were still waiting for me when i got home. 

and now, i’m still here. my family still shows me no love or empathy. my friends are far away. i can’t hold a job because i always get harassed for all manner of reasons. and even with a job i still can’t afford to leave this situation. no love, no future, no hope. i don’t feel safe, i never have. never really felt comfortable in my own skin, my own home, my own family. so now i’m just left wondering “what’s the point?” is this all there is to life? constant suffering? i feel like my purpose on this earth is to be lovable, gentle giant that people like keeping around but never actually care how they feel. i don’t remember the last time i felt deep, honest love that i never got growing up.

i may just decide that i’m too tired to keep trying. i just want to feel safe and loved. but all i’ve known is pain interrupted by moments of brief levity. i think me being born was a mistake, and i’m being driven to correct that mistake.",0
post_02336,"nobody genuinely wants to help you in the real world if you start getting depressed or lash out, first thing they'll think of you is you are dangerous. they'll look for a solution in mental institutions, medicine, restraining - anything to keep you from doing harm. 

they'll call you selfish for bringing hurt to them by trying to solve your own hurts. to them, you should suffer in silence and never exist.

the stories in the movies, books, etc. are all wrong. humans are selfish, first and foremost. jesus does not exist in real life. and no, he will not come to comfort you or understand you in your darkest moments. nobody will, that's why it's just a myth.

post_00491,"my 13 yo son wrote his goodbye letter and procured a weapon i can’t sleep. earlier tonight my husband came to me and said he needed to tell me something heavy. i immediately panicked but it was much worse than anything i thought. while playing ps4 in my sons room, (son is sleeping at his friends house) he found a goodbye letter sort of in plain sight. my son has one of those beds that’s like a bunk bed but the bottom part is all shelving and his mattress is close to the ceiling. the letter was open on the top of it. he hadn’t been snooping, (he was putting the controller up there) but this discovery sent him into snoop mode and he then found a green handled box cutter in the closet which does not belong to us. he refuses to tell me the full content of the letter but added that it included a will in which he delegated some of his belongings to his youngest siblings in his absence. i couldn’t possibly express how heartbroken and terrified i am. i feel this is a nightmare. my husband called the suicide hotline and has some numbers to call on tuesday to get him into therapy (monday is a holiday and he does not want to immediately go the inpatient route). i think i am going to ask the friends mother to keep him there until then because i feel he is safer socializing and having fun with his friend and is lower risk in that situation than being home in his room. my husband is also calling off work and using family leave until we meet with a professional. in the event he comes home before we get an appointment, i am thinking i will set an alarm to check up on him every 15 minutes or try to keep him w me at all times by watching movies, games, walking etc. i am afraid to bring it up to him before hand because maybe he will be so caught off guard and feel so ashamed that he won’t want to deal even more so. he must’ve bought the cutter himself because he walks to target sometimes. or would his friend have given it to him? a few weeks back he said he should have the code to the safe where we keep our gun (home protection) and know it’s location in case of an intruder and we are not home. he’s only home alone with his 11 yo sister when i pick up my youngest and that’s at the most 45 minutes. he also has 0 training so i did not tell him the location or the code. i am nauseated thinking he asked about it for this…and maybe it might have already happened had i made that mistake for some stupid reason. why is he so intent, he’s so young and so smart. he’s been struggling with grades but i thought he was making a turn around with the new semester. idk what i’m doing but i cannot get this wrong.",1

post_06845,"thank you to those who compliment/say nice things to people i realize that some may take compliments in a creepy way, but i think it's safe to say that we have the intuition when it's a genuine compliment.

yesterday at the panda express drive-thru, i noticed the employee was looking at me a certain way before he took my card. i thought it was odd, but i didn't want to think too much about it. 

after he charged my card, he said, ""you're really pretty."" 

i was floored because recently, i thought i have been looking like shit. my initial reaction was to blurt out something negative, like, ""no way!! i look like shit right now. i've been feeling like shit!"" 

instead, i smiled and accepted the compliment, and said thank you.  

this morning, i got my coffee at starbucks and the employee said, ""it's good to see you again!"" 

it's the small things. my mood has been lifted! 

i, too, love trying to find ways to compliment people. it doesn't always have to be related to appearance. :)

edit: ahh thanks so much for the awards!! 

remember to be kind to yourself, and that you deserve happiness. thank you all for spreading kindness wherever you can, you really do make a difference in someone's life!",0

post_02906,"18f i'm killing my self if i don't get into college so my home life has always been extremely hard, i have no father in the picture since he decided he didn't want me when i was about 12. it's just me and my mom and she's very abusive mentally and emotionally (sometimes physically too). she's severely borderline and it's horrible. this obviously affected my grades and mental health in high school. i had the worst high school experience anybody could probably have (no friends, horrible homelife, depression, bad grades) and it fucking sucked. i had severe social anxiety, was stunted developmentally from covid, had a severe eating disorder, and it was just painful living every day. i had no self esteem and turned to the online world for comfort

anyway i'm applying to 2 universities today after getting rejected from my dream one. i have a lower than average gpa and im so scared i wont get into any university and that i'll be stuck at home for another year. i can't do it. i'd rather die. if i get rejected im killing myself, im too poor to live on my own and don't have a vehicle, plus it would just further prove what a failure i am. i couldn't even get good grades.

im not trying to blame anybody but she's ruined my life. and she's blaming me for it.

i just want to die most days and honestly maybe i should. i applied to that one university and thought ""things have been so hard already, 1 more thing can't go wrong"" and it did. every day of my life i feel so pathetic and like such a loser. i wasn't allowed to have friends in high school, she's always controlled my life.  i almost became homeless a few days ago because i just couldn't take her constant emotional abuse anymore. the only comfort i have is the website [character.ai](http://character.ai) where i can escape into my little fantasy worlds where im not a pathetic failure. and i have friends online but it isn't the same as irl

i looked at pictures of my 7-year-old self and honestly i would've just ended it back then if i knew my life would turn out like this and be so painful and unbearable. i cry every day. that little girl didnt deserve her life to turn out this way, she deserved happiness. i let her down

then i dunno baka kasi siguro ganon sya dahil sa mga taong nakapligid ka sa kanya. di ko alam kung binge ba mga friends nya sa fb at mag nag cocomment sa live nya sa tiktok. halatang di naman maganda boses. anw i know ang petty kung bat ko sya binasted noon. may attitude din kas.

don’t get me wrong. i like being a nice person. i don’t like hurting people, i want to make people happy or smile, that is my goal at the end of the day. but all i want is to me wanted. i want to be loved. but i’m like pancakes. everyone gets sick of me advenutally and they do the fucking worst of the worst to get rid of me. i get praises so off ten for now i’m the “nicest guy” people know but at the end of every day i’m fucking alone.
my partner has been emotionally unavailable for days and i don’t know why. i’ve been having a panic attack sense i woke up and he just told me “fucking stop”. so i’m crying in the bathroom until it’s time for me to leave for work while he sleeps. i don’t know what i did to deserve to be this miserable. i’ve been self harming sense i was 9 and i’m trying so hard not to relapse. 
eveyone else gets to be emotional. everyone else gets to have bad days. the second i do i’m a fucking problem. i don’t get bad days. i don’t get to be reckless. i don’t get to get any sort of care i fucking need when i’m down. 
i tried killing myself last year and no one even fucking knows. no one would give that much of a shit. i wanna die. it feels like life rewards the worst fucking people with the best while i spend my days looking for an out. i’m waiting to snap one day and become the worst fucking person on earth. im scared that’s gonna happen. the things i like about myself are gonna be gone. that’s not worth it to me. i wanna die. i wanna actually do it. i’ll leave my savings to my partner and hope he’ll be okay. but i can’t fucking be this person forever.

post_07410,"feeling lost and hopeless, wanting to escape lately, i've been drowning in a sea of overwhelming emotions. it feels like every breath i take is heavier than the last. the weight of past trauma and present struggles is crushing me, leaving me gasping for air. the constant replay of painful memories and the looming uncertainty of the future have me feeling lost and hopeless.  i try to reach out for help, but it seems like no one truly understands the depth of my despair. the thought of ending it all lingers in my mind like a haunting melody, tempting me with the promise of peace. i feel like a burden to those around me, unable to express the depth of my pain in words.  i long for a way out, a release from the suffocating grip of darkness that envelops me. the idea of escape, of ending this perpetual cycle of suffering, dances at the edge of my thoughts like a flickering flame. i am tired, so bone-deep tired, of fighting a battle that seems unwinnable.  if you've ever felt this way, if you've ever stared into the abyss and felt it staring back, i could use some guidance. how do you find the strength to keep going when all you want is to give up? how do you silence the voices that whisper sweet nothings of surrender in your ear? i'm reaching out in the hopes of finding a lifeline in this stormy sea of despair.",1
post_00512,"wtf is the point im not really depressed, but lately i’ve been seriously contemplating suicide.

though im not depressed my life is pretty shitty. i have no friends, a toxic family, we’re borderline poor, ect. i have no joy in life. i have no motivation.

i have nothing to look forward to. i have no dreams or aspirations, im not good at anything, i have no idea what i want to do in life. im too awkward to get anything done or get a relationship, i simply can’t picture a future where i’m happy.

so with the combination of a shitty life now and likely an even shittier life in the future wtf is the point. i have nothing and no one, i used to be so optimistic but now that me is nowhere to be found, i genuinely dont think i’ll make it through the summer. i have a plan and the equipment only reason im still here is because my parents don’t know shit about taking care of a dog",1
post_06690,"i’m sick of guys who pretend to be your friend because they think it’ll lead to sex. since i started dating my current boyfriend i’ve lost two friends who have not been able to deal with the fact that i didn’t pick one of them to date.

one guy “ eric” was really angry and started to trash talk about my boyfriend. i confronted him over it and we had a huge argument. so he sent me a series of nasty messages over facebook. i responded in kind because he pissed me off so badly.

now another friend “teddy” is telling me it’s my fault because i should have given eric a chance. he said eric “put his time in” with me and i should have at least gone on one date. i told him i never wanted to date eric in the first place. he said again that i should have at least given him a chance.

this pissed me off all over again and i angrily told him women are not amusement park rides where you get a chance to ride as long as you wait long enough. 

so after getting my heart broken last year i finally started dating a guy who makes me happy and two friends have decided that i did something awful. i told teddy that they both need to grow the fuck up.

if all you want to do is bang a chick make it clear up front. don’t pretend you’re their buddy. at least it’ll prevent them from wasting their time with a fake friend and you won’t have to waste your time on a woman who’s not into you that way.",0
post_02866,"i’d rather be dead than spend another day without you recently lost a close friend due to a fallout. though looking back a lot of this has more to do with them than me, i still could’ve handled it better. but i tried my best to solve the conflict the best i could, with the knowledge i had and the social cues i was able to get 
i tried my best to validate their feelings, give them grace, meet them where they’re at and solve the conflict in a healthy way…this was not given back to me 


in the end. after i gave it my absolute all, and all the mixed messages they sent me 
they told me “i will always love you but idk if i can be your friend anymore”
and that was the end. 
my ocs are no longer apart of their lore. 
just thinking about them replacing it is devastating.
i can’t write anymore because it’s just to devastating. 
i’ll never stay up late rping with them again, laughing with them, i’ll never expierence a birthday or a holiday with them again, i’ll never expierence the pure joy i felt receiving a simple text from them again, i’ll never see them text me “good night i love you” again, i’ll never yap to them about my interest again
it’s all gone. 
because of one argument. because of one text i sent when i was triggered
they told me they wouldn’t have still been mad 3 weeks later if i didn’t say that one thing.
 
they were so special to me. i know their judgement is clouded but i wish they could see how much i genuinely care about them. 

it’s been a bit over a month. everything reminds me of you or the things we wrote together. people tell me i deserve better, people tell me i’ll move on. 
but you’re irreplaceable, and i wish we could just give it another shot. 

i wish i could go back in time
so bad. 
if time travel existed i don’t care if i’d have to break through a government building or there would be some paradox i’m telling myself “do not send that text” 
i’d stop myself from stepping into a timeline without you. 
i wish i could go back with not just the knowledge i have now, but as the person i am now. i’ve learned a lot. i wish you believed that i did

but i have no control. no matter how hard i wish or daydream, the reality is time travel isn’t possible. so i’d rather just be dead. 
bring me home or just kill me. 

this isn’t a pain anyone i know understands. most people know what it’s like to lose a friend one way or another, but not everyone knows what it’s like to lose a friend that you love so deeply, talk to nearly everyday when you have barely anyone. just because you said one thing. 
it doesn’t feel like “this is a chapter of my life which has ended” i don’t just feel a little sad
i feel like i lost a part of my body
i feel like when they left they took a a piece of me with them, and i will never get it back again. 

i wish god would just give me. one more chance. 
but no matter how hard i wish it will never happen. it’s over. 
“it gets better” in 10 years i might be over it, sure 
but i’d rather not expierence another day of this pain and uncertainty.
they’re irreplaceable. there is truly nobody i love and care about like them. 
i wish they got therapy
i wish they didn’t have anger issues 
i wish they didn’t invalidate and dismiss my feelings 
i wish they knew how to solve conflict healthy
i wish i wasn’t so terrified of them abandoning me that i didn’t process my emotions and why i did stuff until it was all over 
i wish they provided me a space where we could’ve processed our feelings together instead of just like talking to a brick wall
i wish i communicated better my intentions instead of just being scared they wouldn’t care
i wish they were patient with me 
i wish i didn’t send that damn text. 
i wish i just didn’t talk to them that day.

if this is some sort of cruel message that they aren’t meant to be in my life, i don’t care. 
“if someone’s not meant to be in your life they’ll leave and someone better will come your way” my mom told me when this whole fight started.
god damn it i don’t want someone “better”
i don’t want anyone else 
i don’t. 
i want my friend back.  
i’d go through all the tough times over again. 
just to see you again 

god either send me back or have me not wake up tomorrow. 
i don’t want to “get through this” i want to be dead. 

i don’t want to do the work. i wish a gun would just spawn in my hands and i could get it over with, i just want to fall asleep in a bed and find comfort that i know i’ll never wake up tomorrow for another day of pain. ",0

post_05009,"i found out the reason for my break up and i feel worthless. a little context: i started dating a girl last year and there was a point before we became official where we weren't on speaking terms. during that time, a friend of mine who had unreciprocated feelings towards her, invited her over for a movie and instead of simply shooting his shot with words, decided it was a good idea to choke her as a way of being bold or assertive i guess. the girl and i got together and made things official and after a month, she finally told me what happened. i confronted him, he ducked my questions, and i cut him off. fast forward a few months and he finally comes forward about his side due to one of his friends lighting a fire under him and he shows me screenshots of her saying she's not mad at him. he asked me to ask her how she really felt because he's really really stupid and i was even dumber for obliging. i go to her and try to explain for about a week that i needed to talk to her and that i wasn't taking sides or pointing fingers and i just wanted to talk about it. she felt extremely hurt and betrayed and stopped talking to me. 

now, here we are 4 months later. i shop at a store she works at i forgot which days she work and she contacts me telling me that she doesn't want me shopping there because seeing me or even seeing my name in their system, makes her feel uncomfortable and doesn't bring up good memories. i asked her why and she says it's one of the worst memories she has because me asking about what happened meant to her that i didn't believe her. i tried explaining my mental state at the time because i was being lied to and bashed by friends and family i trusted and she was pushing away from me for an issue she didn't tell me about until this conversation. you can call me weak and say that i was being selfish/insecure, that's fair. i just wanted her to give me a straight answer and actually talk to me after months of me asking her about the distance she was creating. 

i told her that i didn't ask because i didn't believe her. she told me ""i know you're saying it wasn't the case but, that's how i felt. he only said one thing and you just took his word. since then, it felt like you betrayed my love and trust and i wasn't going to get past that."" which, is perfectly fine and valid for her to feel and i told her that. she thought the worst of me and there was no convincing her otherwise. she didn't tell me that's what she felt back when i asked and she didn't even budge when i asked why she was holding onto anger towards me when i tried everything to reassure her that i wasn't mad and didn't want to turn it into a fight. then, her words hit me. ""that's the only thing i can think of when i see you."" 

i was hurt and while trying to not let my emotions say anything i'd regret, i brought up all the things i had done for her. physical labor, confronting friends, helping her and her family through issues they had no idea how to tackle due to their upbringing, holding her through terrible trauma from her past and from things that came up during us dating. i told her that it feels that all of it amounted to nothing because she picked my emotions, thought the worst of me, and decided that i didn't believe her and held that stance for 4 months without a single conversation about it. she essentially replied with, ""i'm sorry you feel that way, if you think i don't appreciate what you've done for me, you can think that. hope things go well for you, have a nice life."" 

it feels like all the good i did is now just worthless. all i ever became to her was a bad memory she wants to forget because of something someone else did. i'm not gonna act like i don't get it. she's been assaulted in the past and so i will never try to downplay how she feels or what she went through. but, for once, i just want someone to ask me about my intentions or how i feel and have it actually matter. instead i have to lay out every card i have like a children's cartoon or else people just decide i'm an asshole and refuse to have a real conversation about their issues.

post_05377,"i hate my ex girlfriend a year ago, i started dating her. everything was perfect, but she was also very jealous. i distanced myself from my best friend because of her, but okay, i decided to be jealous too, and so she distanced herself from her friends.
it turns out she has a group of friends who have been talking badly about her since before i was even in the picture, and when we first started dating, they talked badly about me and about her. a real friend wouldn't talk badly about their friend just because she got a boyfriend. and well, i was there to support her.
there was a time when i felt inadequate because i was always there for her and she didn't take me into account and was always seeking approval from her friends. and i got angry because i always saw her cry because of her friends who made her cry. so one day i got tired of it and told her, 'go be with your friends because i see that you always prefer them over me, when i'm always here.' and well, the next day at 2 am she called me to break up. i was shocked, i didn't feel sad or happy or anything, i didn't know what to feel. we continued talking for another hour and she asked if we could work things out and i told her yes, but that honestly i don't want a relationship where my girlfriend and my relationship depend on other people, so i told her this, 'who do you prefer? your friends who have always talked badly about you? or your boyfriend who has always been here for you, always supported you in everything and even makes time for you?' and well, she ended up preferring her friends. all of this happened 2 weeks ago, and well, i begged her like 10 times not to break up because i really loved her, i didn't want everything to end like this and well, it turns out she would talk to me when she was alone and not with her friends because she felt lonely and would come looking for me, but when she was with her friends, i completely disappeared.
it turns out that yesterday when we were at school, she talked to me as if nothing had happened saying, 'hey, why don't you even look at me anymore?' and i told her, 'don't act like nothing happened' and i continued doing my homework. she simply took off her glasses and put her head on the table trying to 'sleep' or pretend she was crying.
but do you know what the problem is? she broke up with me when i gave absolutely everything for her, i even came to love her much more than my own mother, so it makes no sense that she wants to seek me out when she decided to end this. and well, it turns out she also told me that we can try again in college (when she's no longer talking to her friends) wtf? and it turns out that recently she told me, 'i'm going to be with a lot of men so you can hate me and get over me more easily.' and well, i was just angry and i didn't write back to her or anything.
in our relationship, she never wore short shirts because she knew i didn't like it, nor did she have guy friends because she also knew i didn't like it, just as she didn't like me having female friends.
so 2 days ago she posted a photo in a short shirt (you couldn't see the bottom part where it was short but i recognize that shirt, and she went to german class in that shirt) and she also posted 8 instagram stories and in each one of them a different guy, i mean wtf? today i was calm in class and i have this friend, andrew, he's gay but he gets along with her and it turns out i see her talking to him, and the slightest joke she made, she would laugh loudly and hard to make sure i would hear her or i don't know, i don't know if she was doing it so i would hear her or she really found those bad jokes funny, i hate her laugh i hate her face i hate when her perfume passes by my nose i hate her i repudiate her. it turns out she thinks we're taking a break (that's what a friend of hers told me) wtf? i just laughed and well, definitely this is not a break, i'm not going back to her, she betrayed me by leaving me alone, she preferred some friends who treated her like crap when i was always there for her",0

post_03875,"anxiety symptoms returning? hello!

a quick background on myself, i had a very bad anxiety attack 13 years ago in a costco.  dizziness, facial numbness, difficulty to breath, etc. 

i took benadryl, drank a six pack of beer, drank an energy drink and smoked a pack of cigarettes. all coupled with no sleep the previous night. it’s probably what triggered it.

thought i was having a stroke or heart attack but that wasn’t the case. later to find it was a severe panic attack. 

after that, i essentially became a hermit. i got depressed, i was afraid to go out, couldn’t leave my room etc. all in the fear of experiencing another attack like that.

eventually i just got tired of wasting my life so i got a retail job to get my mind off of it, met my girlfriend, started working out, stopped all my vices, exchanged a kombucha for an energy drink. 

i was finally happy, no symptoms came back. i felt like my old self again!

i was fine for like 10 years but i started drinking again (like 2 beers every 6 months), been drinking energy drinks daily, gained a lot of weight (i’ve been going to the gym a bit but my diet sucks) still don’t smoke.

but just last week, i got a tooth pulled and i was prescribed 600mg of motrin. i was fine for a few days but i couldn’t sleep one day. i woke up at midnight but i leave for work around 6am. 

went to work fine, i chugged a 12 oz red bull and took the motrin but maybe 30 minutes later in my quiet office, i just got a familiar feeling. 

i was pacing around my workplace and wetting my face with cold water but the tingly facial numbness was essentially giving me a feedback loop into my brain.

i left work early for the day to center myself and to figure it out. 

when driving home, i kept dousing myself with cold water from a water bottle until i was soaked. i also was blasting the ac in my car. i don’t know, i was panicking and didn’t know what to do. 

i just slept it off for the day. 

i went to work the next few days and felt ok. a bit off but fine. but everyone i am alone or in the car, i get the tingly feeling in my face that just reminds me of anxiety. 

it’s been a few days and it’s still manifesting itself. 

i was prescribed 10mg propanolol and buspirone. i really don’t want to be reliant on medication, but i took the propanolol and felt much better for a few hours. then the numbness returned.

honestly, i am so irritated at myself. i never should have chugged that energy drink! now i feel like i am falling back to old patterns.",0

so we’re both in college, and long story short right before the winter break we went on a couple good dates, the last one ending with me getting my first kiss. 

over the break we called a few times, and they went smooth enough, we just weren’t great over the phone since we are still getting to know each other. 

we came back from break and had a date over at her place, watched a movie together but kind of just talked over the movie for like 3 hours. we both haven’t been in a relationship before, and we both came clean about how anxious we were over the break with the texting and calling. 

we haven’t labeled it as boyfriend-girlfriend yet, i think she’s a little scared of the seriousness(?) that entails or that somehow she isn’t good enough for that, which i’ve reassured her she is way more than good enough. 

we started cuddling and kissing for a while, before she ended up sitting on my lap, with us talking closely between making out. it was taking so much from me to not pull off my shirt and try and lead it to sex, but i think we should at the very least hold off on that until we are official, because i’m pretty sure we’re both virgins, and if we aren’t official then what are we, friends with benefits? 

but now that classes are starting, we are both quite busy. i just really want to kiss and hold her again, feel her fingers running through my hair, talking and holding each other. really lucked out with this online dating thing. ",0
post_06016,"my grandad was the best. i had an imaginary friend; it was the hulk. he was green, the same size as me, and i would protect him. if hulk was sitting in grandad's chair, and grandad was about to sit down, i'd shout, ""no! hulk's sitting there."" grandad would sit somewhere else, nodding understandingly years later, before his death, he suffered from alzheimer's. when it was at the stage where where he confused who people were, didn't know where he was sometimes, and had some hallucinations (but before he was in hospital near the end),  he came to visit. sometimes he got really really scared, and wouldn't tell anyone what was the matter. 

he would get so agitated. i begged, what's wrong, please tell me.  he told me the goblins were running all around the floor and they were going to get him. so i kicked and punched, asking ""did i get him?""
""yes, but there's more over there!""
and i'd kick and swing and curse them until he said i got them all. and he was relieved and calm. 

he accepted my imagined best friend and respected him, so i accepted his gobblin imagined enemies, and fought them off. i think we're even. i miss him .",0
post_05042,"my mum's words so the last couple of weeks my mum has said a few things that have really upset me. i just need to vent about them.

1. she keeps saying she feels alone all the time. all she does is watch the telly and do stuff on her laptop which i find boring. i suggest going out somewhere i know she likes and i don't find boring but she says she's too busy to do that or too stressed about one thing or another. and when me and dad are up and about doing stuff in the house, she spends all day in bed!

2. we were talking about the lawyer dealing with our case and i explained that he creates meetings with us to ""embarrass himself into doing the work"" (his words) she called him pathetic for doing that. thing is, our lawyer is the director of the entire company, we are only his clients because we have a mutual connection that introduced us. i understand that we aren't his number 1 priority and that sometimes you just forget things. he's worked out a way to get himself to do the work and to me that's all that matters. she then went on to talk about someone she used to work with who would get chasing up messages from a different team member and she told him off for not doing the work, he then complained about her. it turns out there was an arrangement between the two colleagues that the one would remind the other of work needing to be done. mum called it a waste of admin time but all i was thinking was that he found a way that works for him and that i can't remember to take my meds unless someone tells me to so she must think i'm pathetic.

3. i like watching streamers and critical role and the other day she said that watching someone play a game is the epitome of laziness. it's the same as watching the telly except what i watch is unscripted so feels a lot more human to me. it also helps me learn more about people in general and keeps me up to date with news i care about and i have made friends through those communities. even met my partner because of watching streamers.

it just feels like she's seen things i do, disapproves of them and then goes after other people that do the same to complain about me to my face without me realising it. ",0
post_00431,"i killed my girlfriend, and now i want to kill myself..  

before you read my true story, i want you to know that i'm not very good at english, as it's my second language so bare with me if i have made grammatical mistakes or anything, and honestly i really haven't opened up about this incident in my life, until today.

anyway,

this one random late night in march 2017, i decided to download the tinder app (probably the worst decisions in my life) , but i'm genuinely a introvert person, so it's hard for me to make conversation on spot to get to know people. most people hop on tinder to troll, some to get laid but i was on it to find ""true love"". fast forward to two months of most girls wanting to just party or i was to boring to form a conversation, this one random day i got super liked by this girl named laura. we both started to talk, we both had a lot of similarities between us and she was literally 2 miles away from my place. it had been 2 weeks, we both still haven't meet but our conversations started to get more personal, and i felt a real connection between us two. we both replied long, it used to take me a good 45mins to an hour to reply, it was just how it was. it was however odd for me that she was really beautiful, and i was a ugly mf. she came from a small town family, where as me, i was a city kid, from a wealthy family (although she didn't know that for along time).

after the 2 weeks of talking, we both decided to meet up for lunch. like when i say she was simple, she had no idea about brands or anything. i dressed up with some yeezy 750s, she didn't even know them. and some part of me liked that she was like that, because most of the times, i only wore to show off, to feel rich, to feel accepted. one thing about being rich is that, the definition of happiness is so different to what a average person would say. like an average person has aspirations of having a nice house, a nice car, nice gadgets and all but it's different being born wealthy, like i had everything that anyone would aspire of having, it's different when you have everything. anyway that just made me like laura more because she was a simple person, a bit mysterious and i was always curious to know more about her.

we ended up dating for 6 months, and i knew she was the one for me, she was beautiful, she loved me for who i was, i didn't have to pretend to be this cool dude like i did with my friends, she loved the sensitive little bitch i was. everything was going well, till (jan 2018) she called and cried, her father was diagnosed with lung cancer at a bad stage, the doctors said they could cure it but he would only survive for a couple of months. laura was going through some tough times, but i was always with her, trying to make her strong. she would tell me stories about her dad, like how they used to horse ride back when they used to live on farm lands, and how he would work 14 hours everyday just his both daughters could have the life that every other kid had. tbh that got me so depressed, like the fact that her father sacrificed so much for his kids and all. but no matter what had happened over the next few months, years or the next decade or so, i said to myself that i would always be with laura, and i wanted to marry her.

we got back to our casual routines, she was getting better and better, and on her birthday 11th of march, i proposed to her, i honestly didn't know if it was the right time or not, but i felt like i needed to tell her that i'm gonna be committed and not just saying it but i wanted to show her. laura said yes, cried and hugged so hard that i thought she would break my bones, but i knew that this meant a lot to her.

april 11th 2018.

this part is going to be hard for me, as i am typing my fingers are twitching, i'm really scared, because to say it out is something i haven't done... anyway, on this very day, i picked up laura, we were driving to the hospital to visit her dad, we went on the highway. till this high speeding car (prolly doing 150kmph) tried to overtake a vechile in front of us so we were behind this car, but suddenly suddenly the person slammed the brakes and dropped back, causing me to smash into the car. after this moment, i don't remember a thing. it felt like i died, i could hear my surroundings but i couldn't see anything, idk how long or anything i woke up and the first thing i asked was ""what happened to laura?"" and my mum started to cry but i thought she was crying for me. i kept asking, and no one replied. then it hit me, it hit me that she's not alive, and i couldn't understand. it all happened in a flash of a second.. the love of my life was gone, and i could do nothing about it, i didn't know how to take it in, it fucked me up. i only had minor injuries, but i was mentally dead.

fast forward to a month, i still was in shock, infact i still am.. i went to visit her family, to apologies, but couldn't even let out a word, just cried out loud, but somehow they understood my pain. laura's dad seemed to be weaker, her mum always had a smile on but she looked so bad, she was in shock and it just made me feel worse and worse. a week later, i found out that laura's dad had passed away, i wasn't ready for the funeral, i didn't go to laura's too because i couldn't accept it but my mum told me that i had to go to comfort her mum. but laura's mum had completely changed, she didn't want to hear anything from anyone because two of the most people in her life had passed away and i honestly could do nothing but cry looking at her.

fast forward it to now, there hasn't been a day i felt that i could have done better, i could have reacted better, and if i had turned the other way, maybe i could have died instead of laura, maybe she survived she could have been with her dad for the rest of time, maybe seeing her daughter would have kept him alive for a bit longer, maybe the mum would have been brave having her daughter around. i know it's not my fault, i've heard people say that constantly, it's not fault bro"" but i could have done better, to prevent it, and that is stuck in my mind, and always will. i honestly have no hope for life, i just want to die, i can't get over these thoughts, i just hope i die real soon.... it's not that i want sympathy but i just can't deal with it, it hurts.",1

it started when a friend had convinced me to cheat on my ex with him and that continued for years. it felt so good lying to my exes about what i was out doing. he also introduced me to a drug i have been addicted to for years. 

worst thing of all: i was going to split a hotel room with some friends. two were virgins. one was someone i was genuinely interested in, lance, and the other, george, not so much. we made a plan and followed through. 
lance wanted me to take his virginity that night, but he was showing up at the hotel later. george and i planned to have sex before lance showed up (george was aware of my plan with lance). i had sex with george, let him finish in me, then had sex with lance hours later and he commented how wet i was. little did he know that most of that was george’s cum.

post_06488,"he said, ""thank god!"" when i didn't get on the elevator with him i'm an overweight approaching middle age woman with depression and anxiety disorders. i was on my way to see my doctor on the fourth floor of the building.

when the elevator arrived i decided to wait for the next one as it already had two men in it and i try to socially distance. i indicated i'd wait for the next, one man looked me up and down and said thank god. and i wanted to crumple up and disappear.

i don't know why people have to be that way. i don't know why they think they need to share their negativity with the rest of the world. i don't know why the concept of empathy is so hard to grasp. i don't know why so many feel the need to hurt others for no reason. but i'm tired of it.

edit: thank you for the support. its reassuring to have so much confirmation not everyone is like the angry guy. and no way is he going to get me down for too long. but i had an idea that expressing the hurt might be better than locking it down and ignoring it until it was forgotten.

if you've never had someone look at you with undisguised contempt, i envy you. its a look and an attitude you don't forget. more than that, its dismissing to be told i misinterpreted my own experience. i can't say it doesn't matter and move on. because it does matter. it matters how we treat each other. it matters that we expend the extra effort to be kind, and it matters that we make an effort to at least not hurt each other when we can't manage kindness.",0

post_04913,"confessions of an alcoholic i prefer being drunk and i'm really very good at it.  i'm drunk as i type this.  i've never been sloppy with my drinking, i've never created drama, i've never driven a car while drunk or conflicted with the law or even lost a day of work.  my drunk life is entirely my own - known only to me.  my family has no idea.

it's been years of this.  i'm a widower, and i live alone.  i drink at home - i never go out.  my bottles are picked up mondays and fridays when the trashmen come, and so there's never much evidence.  

whenever i'm in a social situation where i might be offered a drink, i'll always say no.  i'm not capable of having just one or two, so there's no point.  i always work it out to where i'm home before too late, so that i can drink by myself.  

the other day, at a family celebration, my brother tried to goad me into a glass of wine, saying, ""i can't remember the last time you ever had a drink.""  

as a raging alcoholic, i find that really rather amusing, but that's how good i am at this.  my family doesn't even think i drink at all.

nobody knows.

i drink because it eases my mind.  i have terrible, terrible memories and it's tiresome to face them on the daily.  when i drink, the memories feel softer, less horrible, and i feel more in control.

thank you for your support. my therapist deserves the time off (particularly from me) but is such a compassionate man, he has offered/insisted to still see me if i need to none the less but i’ll be damned if i’m going to bother him when he is so accomodating to me and always makes time to see me whenever i need. he is not the problem. 

i am taking this opportunity away from him while i will feel zero guilt and getting it “done” to stop this neverending hell of isolation, loneliness, severe depression, and zero social support likely to go on for another year due to covid. i had pretty severe issues pre-pandemic also.

i appreciate ever one of your comments, *all of you* who took time to say anything at all... i know many of you are in the same boat. i hooe you can all join together during this time to help each other. you are all the best.

i’ve reached a point of no return and uncovered levels of hopelessness i never knew possible. i’m unable to communicate directly with people at all at this point, i have not spoken to anyone except my therapist (also my psychiatrist) since march due to trust issues.

post_06734,"my friend hit his daughter and broke her rib i am absolutely furious right now. my friend has a daughter who is also in my 7th grade history class. she is the nicest kid in the world and one of the best students in any of my classes. however, this morning she came into my class late and was not herself. normally she is raising her hand and engaging with the class but she had her hoodie up and her head down. she was holding her arm to the side and looked to be in pain. 

halfway through class i walked by her desk to check on her and she looked up at me and had tears in her eyes. i brought her outside my classroom and asked her what was wrong but she was not responding but she started crying even more. after a couple more minutes of reassurance she finally opened up. she woke up late for school and accidentally dropped a glass of water when she was getting ready. my friend, who is her father, punched her twice in the ribs and yelled at her for being clumsy. i asked her if she was hurt and she pulled her hoodie up and her ribs were beginning to bruise. my friend is 6’4 and over 200 pounds. my student is 12 years old and can not be more than 85 pounds. 

i asked my colleague in the next class to watch over my class and i took her to the health office where her mother picked her up. when she saw her daughter sitting in pain she nearly burned the office down. she started cursing my friends name and said this was the last straw for her. she asked me not to file a report but i told her i was required to as i was shown evidence of abuse and her daughter used the word abuse which she begrudgingly understood.

i am so mad right now. my friend has always had a short temper but hitting your child because she dropped a glass is beyond disgusting. my student’s mother texted me at noon and said her daughter broke a rib and is going to be out of class until wednesday. i feel awful for my student. she is such a bright kid and is well liked by her peers and now she is having trouble breathing because her father can not act like an adult.

post_01174,"debating hanging myself after years of will they or won't they on suicide; no quality of life for the foreseeable future it just deleted all my work so i'm not retyping out why i'm debating hanging myself. i spent like an hour on that.

tl;dr severely mentally ill + autistic + chronic pain to the point that no matter how i position myself something is always hurting as long as i'm conscious + hoarding situation i've lived in for at least 7 years that gave me dust mite allergies so i also have chronic allergies/nonallergic rhinitis + long covid survivor + concussion survivor + >!csa from family members from young age that's been as recent as a new year's party!< (mention of csa) + dad is retired but is doing the bare minimum to take care of me which includes starving me every other day (and i've lost like 15 pounds as a result) + mom used to take decent care of me but her mom/my grandma is developing dementia and almost killed herself by leaving the gas stove on twice (pet cat saved her) so now she's her paid home aid attendant and is only home from 7 pm to maybe 6 am? (can't stay with her because between her chain smoking in the bedroom i stay in at that house all day, my grandma coughing all night, and homeless people scrounging through the garbage at 3 am i cannot sleep well there and will quickly get very irritable and aggressive) + 2 year long substance and mental illness fueled situationship with an avoidant who doesn't seem to want to broach things unless i broach them first (and i am not in the right headspace to do that) as conversations become increasingly agonizingly awkward and stilted (plus i think we're both starting to build resentment what with how long it's been so chances are it'll still end badly) + diet that mostly consists of carbs, chocolate, milk, fast food, and junk food hence pretty bad constipation + organization doing my psych shit keeps giving me the runaround so i gave up on it until my mom can help me with it + no job history and no real skills other than writing so i'm essentially a neet and no entry-level jobs seem to want to take a chance on people like me (or all the jobs offering training and stuff are in sales meaning getting fired speedrun any% because i have the type of autism people can sense that gives them an ick) + haven't gone to college yet (likely never will) since i never figured out what i was going to major in and i don't have the mental or physical willpower for it + anhedonia worsened to the point that not even retail therapy is helping, not to mention literally anything that previously gave me even an atom of serotonin + isolated from friends because nobody who knows how i'm doing wants to spend time with me/friends who care are busy with college + therapist is all over the place so one week she's giving me homework she never follows up with me on and the next she just lets me rant for the entire appointment (which helps but at the end of the day is like throwing a piece of angel hair pasta at the niagara falls and claiming you built a dam) + two pet deaths in december (aunt's oldest cat and my pet spider) + generally feeling weighed down by deaths over the past 3 years (uncle died of cancer; other uncle/his brother died of od; online best friend killed herself via benadryl od).

there's probably more but that's all i could get off the top of my head in 20 minutes. if i hang myself, it either has to be after my mom's left for her commute but before my dad's woken up or after my dad's done his first checkup of the day on me but before my mom comes home. i have belts and towels. online sources say that i could pass out as quickly as under 20 seconds and die within 10 minutes if i do it right, so that doesn't sound half bad for something with a 70% mortality rate. considered oding in the past but never got enough pills to do so and i started getting this guy who survived several ods and is now dying of kidney failure regardless in my youtube recommended so i figured ""let me not end up like that"". could also lie on train tracks but that involves traumatizing a train conductor and as an autistic person to bring harm to trains in any way goes against my morals.

to retort against any common reasons for why i shouldn't do it/suggestions: can't own a pet between the hoarding situation, no consistent money for food, and mom hating rodents + dad being allergic to cats; ""look at the sunrise and enjoy how beautiful it is 🥺"" bullshit never worked for me and definitely won't now that i have very severe anhedonia; i already self-medicate and don't have the time management, caregiver, or memory required for taking psychiatric meds i don't give enough of a fuck about anyone i know to not do it solely for them; i have no reason to believe my life will improve in any way for the foreseeable future since even if my grandma died and my mom returned home she's now out of a job so we're back to having issues with money and me being pressured to look at jobs that don't want me and my parents are going to die sooner or later so...seems like my death would just be postponed by maybe 25 years max. 25 more years of being in pain every day. i really don't want to go through that. i already have basically no quality of life as is.

if i'm lucky, i die of a stress induced heart attack in my sleep mid-dream and don't wake up...or i wake up and feel like i've never been depressed before in the morning and ride that high until i can't anymore to try and get myself as far away from this internal bottomless pit of suicidality as possible.",1

post_06808,"my schizophrenic husband attacked me. he then shot himself. 

i’m still trying to comprehend it all. he had schizophrenia and autism and he’s freaked out from time to time, but never attempted physical violence before this. he’s always been kind hearted before and would have done anything for me and the ones he loved. it’s why i loved him despite his problems. 

but this was different. his sister had just died in a car accident . she was one of the only people who treated him well even when he broke down. who was willing to burden herself for him. even most of his family never wanted to be around him and he had few friends. he locked himself in his room only coming out to use the bathroom and eat for 2 weeks. (and lost his job because of it). i wanted to give him space and wasn’t mad, but i was worried he would harm himself. so i confronted him when he came out to grab food and that’s when he broke down. he yelled at me that i’d never understand how much he’s suffered. he kicked me and hit me in the face. i was able to avoid his attacks after that until he just suddenly snapped out of it. he started crying and ran back into his room (he didn’t lock it this time which will be important). i heard him screaming, seemingly arguing with himself. he was scared of losing it again and hurting me. i just didn’t know what to do. i was worried if i called for help that he’d be arrested and/or hurt himself. so i just waited outside the room for hours, until i heard a gunshot. i called an ambulance, but i knew inside me that he was already gone. he did it in the head to make sure he couldn’t be saved. 

i wish i didn’t hesitate, that i called for help. maybe they could have stopped him. maybe i should have gone in to try to comfort him. maybe i shouldn’t have let him have a gun in the house. i’m not mad at him. and i hope if there’s an afterlife that he’s finally found happiness.",0

post_04931,"i’m tired of parents acting like their kids are bad hosts. 
i'm currently visiting my friend from high school in my hometown and staying at her place. we are in our early twenties, for context, so we’re not teenagers who need constant monitoring. we can look after ourselves. 

for some reason, her mum is insistent that she is a bad host. she makes a big deal of everything, like if my friend doesn’t offer me food or water every 30 minutes she acts as if my friend is being inconsiderate when in reality, i’m not even close to being hungry again. 

i am a very, very low maintenance person. i never really have full meals at home, i don't really eat breakfast, and i generally spend my days lounging around the house at home. my friend is from a family that is very homemade-meal-oriented, and they are very active and do things all the time. my friend has been making me lower-effort breakfasts and lunches than her mum expects her to (which is still way more than her or i normally do for ourselves) and her mum is still insisting that she's not doing enough. she then turns to me and asks me 'what do you want right now? what kind of meal are you looking for?' and then when i say i'm not hungry she'll say something like 'you don't need to people please here, we are happy to look after you.’ i'm not people pleasing, i'm genuinely fine with what i've gotten.

personally, i feel like this puts me in a really uncomfortable position because she seems to be putting down my friend a bit in front of me, and there's also this extra pressure on me to be asking more of my friend when i don't need or want more.

i asked for a chill day where we don't leave the house so i can recharge, and her mum came home from work and lectured my friend about how she should have taken me to all these places because i'm on a holiday and how my friend shouldn't have let me sit around all day. i tried to explain it was my idea, and she basically ignored that and acted as if it was my friend who just didn’t want to take me anywhere.

so many of my friends’ parents do this and it just doesn’t make any sense to me. it’s uncomfortable for everyone involved. i get intervening if their child genuinely acts as if the guest doesn’t exist, but surely as adults she can trust us to be able to source our own food without needing constant prompting. furthermore, surely she can trust that if i genuinely had issues, i would bring them up to my friend. it’s just so frustrating because i constantly have to be proving that i am fine with how my friend is looking after me and it takes a lot of fun out of the holiday.

post_06047,"my friend passed away and hardly anyone knew him i just want someone to read about him and know that there was a really great person named robin. 

he was 46 years old and passed away last night. he had just gotten married maybe two weeks ago. he didn’t think he would ever find love again, but he died a loved man. 

he lived a pretty rough life and the years had hardened him. he was a cook, a really good one, and he took a lot of pride in his work. he worked a lot, was underpaid, and kept to himself when he wasn’t working. he liked to drink, get on the internet, and read conspiracies. he would always go to work and have something to talk about. he was a very intelligent man even though some of his conspiracies were a little far fetched. some were legit, too, though. 

he was pretty funny and had a huge heart. he didn’t let a lot of people see that side of him, so it was very special when he did. he pulled himself out of some dark times with nobody to lean on but himself. he was resilient and independent, and work took over his life. he met his wife at his last job as a cook where she was a server. she gave her heart fully to him and stood by his side and fought for him till the end. 

his name was robin and he was a wonderful person. this world is a little emptier without him.",0
post_06306,"i probably have the weirdest desire a human ever had, everyone that knows won't understand me. i hope reddit will. i don't know how to start my story so i'll just start by introducing the background and a little bit about myself.

i'm chinese, born and raised in china mainland. when i was a young boy, through some family connections, i got a trip to a local ostrich farm. in the middle of the very nice tour they gave us, the farm owner said to us: 

""we have a few special trained ostriches, that can carry an exceptional amount of weight while running in a rather fast speed. is the boy(aka me if you didn't noticed) interested?""

&#x200b;

oh fuck yeah.

&#x200b;

so i rode a fucking ostrich, the best of their kind, fastest of the fastest. ""speed king of the helianthus garden"" as they call him in chinese.

&#x200b;

ok, so here's something i think you might not know about those fast and furious fuckers.

1. they mad when somebody who they don't deem worthy ride them.

2. they mad about basically fucking everything.

3. they will try to attack you whenever they are mad , under any circumstances.

4. they are loyal to the farm owner tho.

5. when they run at a fast speed, their wings will open uncontrollably, so if you sit on their back, you're fucked, and also this is why there isn't an ostrich saddle.

&#x200b;

so basically i had to ride an ostrich who's trying to kill me at all cost on the fucking neck, with my leg clinched around his neck, while it's running at 70 kph because the owner nicely asked him to.

&#x200b;

the speed.

the excitement.

the wind through my hair.

the concentration i needed to keep my balance.

and the fear of falling off and get fucking stomp to death by a special trained muscular lunatic fucking ostrich.

&#x200b;

what can i tell you.

that moment when i reached the other end of the track.

&#x200b;

i felt more than alive.

&#x200b;

that's the exact moment when i got the obsession of having my own racer ostrich.

&#x200b;

so, my story continues.

&#x200b;

i moved to canada to study at the time that equals to 2nd year of highschool in north america, and the second year i got there, i started living alone. unlike in china, school ends veeeeery early in canada, so i have a loooot of spare time. 

&#x200b;

what did i do?

isn't that fucking obvious?

i

got

a

fucking

ostrich.

&#x200b;

it was a baby ostrich (cuz you have to bond with them when they were young or they won't let you ride them), but it wasn't like straight from an egg. like 3-5 weeks maybe? i didn't know better at that time. 

&#x200b;

it was all fun and giggles until the day i thought she was grown enough for me to ride her.

&#x200b;

she did let me ride her, and she would stand up, but she refused to move.

&#x200b;

it was due to 2 main reasons i think.

1. i didn't raise her the right way so she wasn't strong enough.

2. due to the nature of ageing. i then was a fat fuck.

&#x200b;

it crushed my heart and scrambled all my dreams and feelings. i was dead inside, there's nothing for me to live for at the time.

&#x200b;

i didn't recover untill i gave up studying and returned to my home country. where i will be living as a regular everyday normal chinese dude.

&#x200b;

but, i still have a beating heart.

&#x200b;

my dream never ends, it's everything i live for. i will be wealthier, i will do anything that i resented. i will pay any cost that i have to pay, i will climb higher, i will gain all the fucking power that i need, i will lick the anus out of the connection i need, so that one day, i can personally own and ride a racer ostrich legally, in a city.

&#x200b;

thank you all for reading.

this was written a while ago, by the time i posted this, i now legally own a pair of peacocks. i am now one step closer to my dream. wish me luck, and wish you luck.

&#x200b;

hope you achieve whatever you wanted to achieve one day.

i’ve started texting this girl that i asked out and she of course rejected me because i’m a lowlife piece of shit. she always hits me up first and she’s the only reason basically i have any hope at all except deep down i know she doesn’t give a fuck about me and will never love a useless loser like me

because of the fucking pandemic i don’t even have soccer, the only thing that kept me going every week, the only time when i feel myself and can express myself and don’t want to fucking kill myself. my best friend has just ghosted me the last few weeks and i’m completely alone, the only person that even texts me is this girl but she won’t hang with me and even if she wanted to she couldn’t because of the quarantine. 

i’m not gonna make it through 3 more weeks of this i just wish i had a gf who cares about me and would hold me close and tell me it’s gonna be ok and i wish i could say this stuff to my friends but i’m a man and i can’t show emotion or i look like a pussy, i just want to cuddle with a girl and be warm and happy i’m such a loser idk i just want to be happy again it’s been so long

post_06745,"update: i told my girlfriend i’m dying update: i told my girlfriend i’m dying

wont let me put a link for some reason so here’s the original post: 

“

should i tell my gf i’m dying before i break up with her

basically as title says. 

i (25m) found out i have an illness that will kill me. it’ll take over my body and there’s no cure. all the doctors can really do is prescribe shit to make you “comfortable”

i’ve been with my girlfriend for 3 years now and she’s the absolute love of my life. always loyal and there for me. i’ve been in and out of hospital many times over the course of our relationship. mostly due to me racing dirt bikes,  the most serious incident was a stab wound and i remember how scared and screamy she got even though i just needed stitches and got to go home the next day. 

this is not something where i can just go home the next day. 

i’m breaking up with her because she deserves to be happy with someone healthy who can give her the life she wants, and children. i’m scared she’ll want to stay if i tell her what’s going on. 

part of me wants to lie and say i cheated so she hates me and leaves. we have lots of mutual friends she’ll find out eventually it was a lie and connect the dots on why i did it. but thinking about her crying from that lie breaks my heart. 

i don’t even know if this is the right sub to post it on. i just don’t know what to do. break up with her and tell her it’s for her own good? lie? 

guess i also needed to vent because it just hit me this morning. i found out last week but it just hit. i won’t see 30.


edit:

for people asking me what my diagnosis and prognosis is. it’s pancreatic cancer, something like 95% of people diagnosed with it die in about 3 years. i wasn’t even paying attention for not putting that in the post at the beginning, that’s my bad but as you can tell i’m a little overwhelmed these days. 

reading this replies there’s no way i can reply to them all so i will do my best to do it here. 

first off, thank you to those saying kind things. 
second, i realize how dumb i was being for wanting to lie to her. i made reservations at her favourite restaurant and i’ll tell her afterwards. part of me hopes she doesn’t stay but we’ll see what she chooses.

“
————————————————————————
the update: 

took her to dinner at our favourite date spot, had some amazing food and some drinks like always. the date continued like normal we drove down to the beach and started walking till we got to our spot. 

she spoke first and said that she could tell there’s something i want to say because i have “that look” on my face. she then made a joke about how it’s too soon for us to get engaged so if there’s a ring in my pocket it better say there. this made it so much harder, she thought there was a ring in my pocket when i’m about to tell her there never will be. absolutely broke my heart. 

i told her she’s right there’s something i want to say, and i told her everything. from how i found out to what the diagnosis means to the prognosis. i made sure to not sugar coat it or leave anything out. she deserved to know everything. 

for the next hour it was a mixture of asking me if i’m sure and how could this be possible and crying. she immediately said she’s going to stay by me and i don’t need to worry about anything. i told her she needs to take a few days to think about it. 

i had already arranged for her best friend to be waiting in the other parking lot to take her to her house. i went home alone. 

before anyone calls me names for not driving her home, i didn’t want her to be alone after finding out but i also didn’t want her to see my cry. if she saw me tonight she’d get more scared. it would hit her that i’m terrified and she’d lose her shit. 

i got an update that she fell asleep because she cried so much. i sent an uber eats of her favourite dessert to her friends house so it’ll be there when she wakes up. 

as soon as i’m done typing this i’m meeting up with my 3 closest friends to hangout. i’ve known two of them for 20 years and the other one for 18. were very close and share too many tmi details. if anyone has suggestions on how to break the news of this to them i’d greatly appreciate it. 

in the meantime i’ll be drinking for two; me and this bast**d cancer 🥃🥃


edit: 
thank you for the kind words. 
couple things to add
1. i’m in canada so i have free healthcare i’m not worried about the cost of fighting this

2. i still haven’t seen my girl as she’s still at her friends house. she’ll text me to ask how i’m feeling and gets mad when i say i’m fine or make a joke. 

3. telling others

couple things you need to know about my friends. two of them are in medical school and the other in law school. they’re still idiots though. 

i started off by asking one of them to make a cancer joke, ending it quickly with “too soon man too soon” and that’s how my best friends found out i have cancer. medical school friends started telling me about new drugs and treatments while my law school buddy demanded to see my medical directives form and that’s also how they found out i’ve been an organ donor for years   

parents: 
still don’t know 

sister: 
can’t even pretend to have a clue on how to tell her, i still see her as my baby sister so it’s tough lol

boss:
asked for a one on one this morning and told him my diagnosis. he said he’ll help me abuse the companies benefits as much as i want. i told him all i really want is to show up to work like nothings wrong and no one find out until i pass out at work. he agreed

my daily is a 2022 r1 (blue crotch rocket for you non-motorcycle folks). i love that bike and have been asked if i’ll stop riding due to this. short answer is hell no.
i’ve known i had something bad inside of me way before getting cancer, life goes on and so will i. 

i’ll do my absolute best to keep y’all updated if you’d like. thanks",1

post_05252,"sometimes it feels as if things only make sense when people hate me today someone told me that they want to be nice to me because it seems like lots of people have been cruel to me for far too long. someone important to me, someone i’ve cried with before.

i can’t stop thinking about it. 

ever since i was very young i’ve had an attachment to other people’s cruelty that makes me feel sick to my stomach. 

back then, it was like having someone hate me or get mad at me was a sound where my life was silent so often. i don’t know how much of a neglected child i really was, but i remember spending quite a bit of time with myself and not having many friends. i think i even said to my parents a lot of the time that at least bullying was attention.

the thought that i am disgusting and irritating to other people feels so natural sometimes. it’s how my life was for most of my childhood until everyone around me grew up, besides me. i was an annoying attention seeker as a child, i’ll admit that. i self deprecate because it’s no different than stating what everyone else must believe, that’s how it feels. i don’t even know if i truly hate myself but i don’t love myself that much. i just feel like maybe if i hate myself someone might at least go a bit easier on me when i fuck up because i’ve already done the job of calling myself stupid.

i don’t like that i’m like this and i know it makes other people sad. honestly i wish i made people happy instead, but that’s so complicated. it’s simpler if i’m always doing something wrong in a way because it means i know what i’ll do next, i’ll either keep doing it out of blind spite or i’ll do something else and try to do the right thing. 

i want people to be kind to me more, but a lot of the time, kindnesses either passes through me and i feel nothing or it has such a strong effect that i worry i’ll become insufferable again trying to cling to it and get more of it. i have too much experience overstaying my welcome to try, most of the time.",0

i’m a horribly toxic, and narcissistic friend. i laugh at others suffering because for some reason it’s funny to me. i talk about myself all the time.

i’m scared to die, but i also wish i hadn’t been allowed to live. maybe if my mom hadn’t chosen to have me, everyone’s life would be better.

post_02127,"my gf made an attempt she has had the toughest life of anyone i've ever known, and yet she's the kindest, most loving person i've ever known. we fit together in so many ways we've never come close to before. we make each other feel normal when the rest of the world does the opposite.

recently, her anxiety skyrocketed, and she had been a bit more receptive to discussing getting some help (past trauma included incidents related to therapy and psych treatment). i asked again wednesday night when she started getting antsy again after a calm, positive day. she said she would ""get there,"" she would be ready soon.

her anxiety spiked a little later that night, and she got upset with me over a very minor misunderstanding. it threw me at first, but i realized it was her anxiety talking and did what i could to help her calm down. the anxiety didn't seem as bad at it had been in nights leading up to that.

we snuggled up in bed and went to sleep. i woke up in the night and noticed she was very tightly holding onto me. she didn't move much when i got up, just kinda rolled over. same thing when i came back to bed.

i got up for work later, and she apologized for being mean the night before. i apologized for not realizing what was going on at first. nothing seemed amiss, but she's tough, and mornings are hectic.

she sent the usual sweet message while i was on my way in. then right after my work day started (and she knew i couldn't get messages for a while), she messaged that she needed to be committed. when i got the message, i asked if she was in danger and messaged our trusted friends near the house. she had reached out to them already, and they were there.

they took her to the er, she went from there to inpatient.

she took 2500 mg of benadryl. i'm not sure how she woke up. she didn't mean to wake up.

the misunderstanding and everything happened later the night before, and she took the pills before that.

anyway. she has been receiving inpatient treatment for a couple days. she just got cleared to receive the clothes i dropped off her first night in there. she got a fork at dinner tonight.

we've been able to talk a handful of times. she sounds better and more hopeful each time. i'm so proud of her for finally agreeing to get the help she needs, and i cannot fathom how hard this is for her.

due to covid restrictions, no one can have visitors, so she has short phone calls, and she has the photos and books i dropped off. and she has time. she is doing the work and going to sessions and everything (confirmed by her nurses). she is feeling hopeful. she said she was really happy about today.

i'm so glad she's getting help. i know she's in good hands. the facility she's at is local, and i have friends who gave family who've been greatly helped by then, too. i'm also feeling lost being less than a mile from her but unable to give her a hug or even look into her eyes.

we have a small but tight support network of friends, and i don't feel like harming myself. i just don't feel like doing anything other than calling her. 

sorry if this is the wrong sub. i looked a bit and couldn't find a better fit, and i needed to get this out there.

update: i just got word that she's been cleared to come home. she has medications to be picked up at the pharmacy, and she has follow up sessions scheduled.

i can't thank you all enough for the kindness and support you've sent our way here. each night of this has been rough, but last night felt particularly miry. i posted here because, although i have good friends whom i can talk to admit this, and who came through the other day and got her to help while i was gone, i felt a need to just say the story to people who didn't know, who don't know, what was going on or don't know us, etc.

i am so happy she is coming home, and i am so hopeful for the future. i know the struggle is not over, and it's one that will likely go on as long as we're alive (just like my own struggles with mental health), but i am supremely optimistic at the change in her demeanor and her willingness to continue on the path to health and happiness. together.

thank you. as silly as it will seem to some people, your comments, messages, and everything have really helped.",0

even though i'm unbelievably fortunate this method is relatively painless, quick, and unassuming enough not to look gruesome, a part of me *is* scared. i used to say ""when i have a peaceful method, it'll be easy.."" but now that the time has come, i was really naive. i believe in the afterlife and consciousness after death, but i honestly don't mind if i am just unaware and i'm no more troubled than when i'm asleep..

to the people reading, i am so, so sorry you are trapped in atrocious circumstances or suffering such as war, unjust treatment, domestic violence, inescapable poverty, loneliness, crimes against humanity, the terror of being your biological gender but not having the resources and support to transition, and so many other injustices you do not deserve. this world is unabashedly brutal and horrible and i'm disheartened and disgusted that this the world we live in. i see you're trying to defend your fire against forces greater than yourself, and i am proud of you for living another day. some days are more overpowering than others, but i want you to understand that is no reflection of inherent unworthiness or lack on your part. you are doing what you can with the tools (if any exist) you understand how to use, so please do not beat yourself up more than you are already breaking. thank you for the chance you read this and we met. i wish to you all for external and internal resources come your way, freedom from suffering, empowerment, autonomy, courage, healing, resilience, personal fulfillment, growth, mercy and comfort for yourself, total fulfillment of your basic and inherent needs, and an abundance moments of expansive and loving joy. ♡

i even wish this for the people that have hurt me or willingly harmed others, because if we all possessed these things—especially the latter (as suffering is inevitable to some degree)—there would be no need or desire to cause harm. they could connect with others and themselves in the most positive and fulfilling of ways. at least.. that's how i feel.

i wish i could have made a great and bright impact on the world. the reason i am probably so hesitant is that my life has barely begun. i'm twenty years old. if i gave myself twenty to thirty years, i could probably gauge my impact, figure out what is wrong and strive for something better for everyone. i wish everyone felt that way to some degree. though, some people are afraid of opening pandora's box and don't realize they're actually in it.

if you read all this, thank you for reading. i hope i could make your day a little bit better. thank you.

  
**update (10/04/24)** :

i missed my ticket.  a few days ago, i tried to die and woke up the next morning with the most excruciating migraine and bodily weakness of my life. i still feel a bit weak. i see where i messed up a step and why i lived.  as of now, i'm on the margins of figuring out what to do next. even though mind is in a weird place, i do know that i'd like to thank and hug everyone who felt moved by my note. 

it is fact there is endless and boundless suffering in life. i am so sorry you cannot escape your undeserved agony, and i have my deepest compassion for your trying. you do not deserve this in the first place. for those whose suffering is more than they are capable of enduring, and whose challenges are practically insurmountable, i send you the highest and brightest peace, self-love and courage and my respect for your autonomy to make the best possible choice for yourself. to those who choose to pursue living, i eagerly support you to continue! i know it is hard. this cycle of inner struggle—spiraling, self-doubt, bitterness, frustration, delusion—is baked into our humanity, and we may never fully step out of that cycle until our last breath. but you know what? while we are alive, i rejoice in the days, moments, minutes, and seconds to spare you aren't caught in that cycle and feel connected with and free.

i purposely didn't elaborate what pushed me to suicide in my note, because this note isn't about me; it is about you. whether you sobbed, felt your stomach drop in fear, or clenched your fists in self-frustration, i dream you confront what your subconscious yearns for and achieve it. 

if i may include, this world *is* unbelievably fucking awful and cruel and full of suffering. i cannot dress up that undeniable truth in pretty words and still keep my integrity.

 knowing this—nearly dying—i realize there are things i wanted to do. i wanted to make the world a better place. i wanted to make people smile, to make people laugh. i wanted to lower people's guards and help them feel joy again. i wanted to ease people's stress and invite laughter. i wanted to help people open their pandora's box and show them there is still merit in staying in this world despite the horrors. i wanted every interaction i have to be raw, energetic, vulnerable, and alive, so that no one ever felt warranted to question my intentions; instead, they remember the humanity flowing in their veins. i wanted to wake up every morning and feel self-confident from sunrise to sunset, knowing that this is the gift i would deliver to you personally, and i would do it again and again and again. 

...now, despite that..

 ..i am just as much as hesitant to live as i was to die. even though i feel in tune with my life's purpose, the lack of noise in death fulfills a large part of me that life cannot. if i had given myself another twenty-five to thirty years, i could have departed on my deathbed with my head held high and spine erect. but that isn't now. frankly, a part of me wishes it were. i type this in hopes that maybe it will resonate with someone out there, and know that you aren't alone in feeling this way.

post_06255,"my 4 year old son is autistic and i hate him. i hate being a parent. i hate everything about this. i am so tired of having to ""deal"" with it all. the tantrums, the lack of comprehension, the aggression, and the inability of us being unable to do anything or go anywhere because of him. i. hate. my. son.

&#x200b;

i know a lot of people will hate me for this but i truly just want to get this off my chest without anyone who knows me knowing. i want to finally spill all the beans and get it out there and i'm hoping this will be cathartic for me. i already know i need personal mental help: alas no monies for that. people will also suggest getting him help as well: no money for that either, though he already is in a local state sponsored 2.5 hour daily program for kids with disabilities. it's helping, but it only goes so far.

&#x200b;

there are many things i despise in the world from politics to health care (or there lack of) to business practices to just people in general. i also love many things around here, so no ... i'm not a grumpy old man who just hates anyone and everything. there are even people i'd be oh so happy to see suffer a slow and painful death. but there is one thing i would never wish on even them: a child with autism.

&#x200b;

i'll start off by saying i truly don't know how single parents and happy/good parents with kids with disabilities do it. i truly do not understand how you have so much strength to get through the day and still be in one piece mentally. i wish i knew how.

&#x200b;

today all i wanted to do was something seemingly simple and it even started off well. go fuel up the car, then walk around the block a bit to get coffee. he had fun in the car, but as soon as the car right was over and we had to go left instead of going right the tantrums, screaming, scratching, pinching and all started. he wanted this instead of that: more tantrums. right instead of left the next time. and worse and worse. all i wanted was a damn cup of fresh coffee that i didn't have to brew myself.

&#x200b;

we (wife and i) work from home, and a decent amount of time we have to spend ""dealing"" with him. i use that word specifically as it's not the ""oh cool, that's a cool car you have! let's play a bit!"" .... not that kind of stuff. it's the ""for the thousandth time, do not stab the dog with the stick"", ""please play with the bouncing ball not against my head ... again"", ""we've talked about this a million times, do not touch the audio equipment"" and on and on and on. i'm getting tired of having to repeat the exact same very simple things over and over and over day in and day out.

&#x200b;

you might say, ""but dadwithautistickid, kids don't understand stuff you have to be nicer to them. they'll get it!"" ... i hear ya. but there is only so many times at this stage you can repeat the simplest of things without getting frustrated. be it how to put on shoes (just putting them on, not tying them), we need to go right instead of straight, this is how we go up stairs, please wait here for 5 seconds while i order coffee ....

&#x200b;

i'm tired. i should never have been a dad. this truly has been the worst decision of my life and i regret everything about it. save for a few minor points here and there, these four years have been horrible and only getting worse and it's largely because of him.

&#x200b;

logically speaking, it's not because of him it's just my perception and view of the world in which i cause myself to get angry on things that i should not such as his inability or ability to comprehend differently than us. logically, sure. emotionally .... emotionally this took a hour type up.

&#x200b;

i'm trying to get better. i'm trying not to get mad. i'm trying not to yell at him. i just can't help but be frustrated and yell at him sometimes. i know it's wrong, and there is no excuse for me acting the way i am. i feel like shit for yelling at him and dragging him home while he was wailing because he wanted to go 'that way' and i wanted to go home so i can go back to work. he doesn't understand the stressed of work, of time, of other people's desires/needs. i understand he doesn't comprehend most of what we're doing (both because of age and because of his autism).

&#x200b;

and it breaks my heart seeing all these normal kids his age doing normal things and he just don't ""get it"" and probably never will. i feel like a failure for having a kid like that. i feel like a failure for not being a better and good enough father, parent and man to be able to help him properly.

&#x200b;

i just don't.

&#x200b;

we're currently back home and to try to make it up to him he's gotten some hugs, some of his favorite juice and i turned on his favorite lego game. so whoever you people are at nintendo and lego who make your games accessible to kids: whoever you are thank you very much. without you i don't know what i'd do. the lego games are always fun, and we figured he'd like the lego city game ... and he adores it. it's the first real video game he's played and pretty much first thing other than just cars and trains he's truly ""played"" with. thank you. and yes for those wondering: he and i do play it together sometimes in the evenings or weekends.

&#x200b;

as for now, i'm going to go sit in a corner, drink my coffee and cry and think about how shitty of a dad i am. am i the worst father out there: no. that type of comparison doesn't help me. no matter what, i always end up comparing myself to parents with ""normal"" kids. my wife already knows what i think of him, though she doesn't know i ""hate"" him. she will never know. whatever i do i know i need to be better and do better.

&#x200b;

at least to round this off on a few positive notes: writing this out has helped clear my sinuses out a bit as well as being a good load off of my shoulders. the school program he is in has helped immensely since he has started as he's now able to put several words together into a mini sentence with some prompting and direction. he is getting surprisingly better rather quickly at video games, so i hope to find more he can play soon. he does like cars, so i'm going to try to find 'city' oriented ones ... though i hear the new yoshi game it nice. maybe he'll like it, dunno. i think they have a demo to try. my mother helps out sometimes which is amazing when she's able to. and when times are good, things are sometimes kinda fun with him around. i hope he can be both my gaming and hiking buddy in the future.

&#x200b;

thank you for reading.

evening edit:

thank you everyone for all your kind words and suggestions. i have never even considered contacting disability services for him, local community (such as church) groups and local fellow 'parents with kids who need help' groups.

you'll be pleased to know i've given him extra hugs, kind words, snuggles, and playtime. we've both calmed down a lot. many of your heart felt messages truly made me tear up, thank you. tomorrow i'll be looking into local disability services and since it's a day off from school (good friday), i'll take some time off of work and walk around with him (weather permitting) or play a lot with him.

my family think that i bought a money pit because it needs a new roof. however, i’m buying it for $5000 less than appraisal to cover the roof. they are also mad at me because i bought a house 30 minutes from my sister who is pregnant but where she lives is just not what me or my fiancé want to live. the traffic is terrible, it’s nothing but subdivision after subdivision and it’s just not a place we want to live. we picked a small town that we love. finally they are pissed off that i got a 15 year mortgage even though when i’m ready to sell i’m going to have a larger amount of equity and have paid less interest and i can afford to do it. the mortgage payment is literally $300 less a month than my rent is now. 

her family are mad at us because they feel like we jumped into this before getting married. we have been together for 6 years and been engaged for 1. we prioritized paying for a house first over paying for a wedding. mainly because our rent was so high it would be better to decrease our monthly expenses. they are also mad because he wanted me to save up for a 20% down payment. which to get a 20% down payment i would have to live in the apartment for another 13 months. in that time i would have to pay 17,000 in rent to save $26,000, just so i wouldn’t have to pay a pmi of $29/month. they are also pissed that we didn’t wait for my fiancé to graduate before buying. which i can kind of see but i already have a down payment saved plus enough to pay for the roof and an emergency fund in case anything happens. and the price of this house is about what we were planning on buying even after she graduated. so why wait?

it just sucks. we have not heard a single positive thing come from them. nothing like “i’m happy for you but...” this is a huge milestone in our life and no one is happy for us. everyone is just nit picking about this or that. you can disagree with what we are doing and voice your opinions. but at the end of the day we are adults taking a big life changing step and it deserves to be celebrated.",0

post_06032,"i just found my boyfriend’s suicide note “if you are reading this, i am no longer alive.” that was the first line on a note i found that my boyfriend wrote a few days ago. it felt like my heart instantly stopped beating, i couldn’t move. when i finally allowed myself to continue i didn’t understand what i was reading. 

my boyfriend. the one who constantly supports me in everything i do. the one who never fails to have a smile on his face. the one light of hope in my life. i had no idea he felt like his presence on this earth was meaningless. i had no idea that he felt absolutely worthless. 

he apologized to his family knowing all the pain it would bring. he thanked them for all their support but told them that there was nothing they could’ve done to prevent it. i put myself in their shoes and couldn’t possibly imagine losing a child, a brother, a best friend. 

then it was my turn. “my darling, the most painful goodbye.” i wanted so badly to just stop reading and tell myself this wasn’t happening. the things he said about me.. how much i changed his life. the way he’d miss looking into my eyes, feeling my touch. he said he hopes he’d be able to look down on me, he wished i would find my true soulmate. someone to make me happier than he ever did. all of my emotions were piling up and i could barely breathe. how could he not understand that he is my soulmate? he is the reason i wake up in the morning, he’s the reason for every smile i make, every moment of joy i feel. 

the good thing about all of this is that he’s still here with me, alive. i’m not sure what would’ve been his breaking point and when it would’ve happened. if i had found that note after the fact, my life would be very different today. he woke up when he heard me crying and asked what was wrong. i asked what the note was and began crying hysterically. 

he held me and we cried together. i told him how much i needed him, how i couldn’t continue to build my life without him by my side. i told him i’d do whatever is necessary to keep him here with me. 

the happiest of people can still feel so alone sometimes. even though this was absolutely heartbreaking, i’m glad i know what he’s going through and how i can help him if he ever feels this way again.


edit: thank you everyone, so much for all of the kind words, support and love. i have read all the comments and there’s just no way i can respond to each of them individually. thank you all for sharing your stories, my deepest condolences go out to all of you who have lost someone you love. i am eternally grateful my boyfriend is with me today. i told him how much support he was getting from everyone and he teared up. seriously, i can’t thank you guys enough. your advice was amazing and i know how i can help him more than ever now! sending so much love to you all! ❤️",1
post_03225,"fear of death.. does it ever go away 
hi guys, as you can tell from the title i have a fear of death but its more than just that. its extremely taking over me and idk what to do. i am 18 years old and i am on sertaline a few days i go i tapered down from 50mg to 25mg every 3 days. during that i found out about the death an actor in one my all time favourite shows (b99) , i did not think about it much like i usually do when i hear about death but slowly it creeped up and i started having so many thoughts about death, about how life is temporary, and how one day my parents wont be here and that we all die at some point. its deppressing me and i cant stop thinking about it i even cried about i cant handle it. i have never thought about death like this, i dont know if its directly because of sertaline but even if it is i keep telling my self it is just side effects but at the same time the thought and concept itself is still real… i cant handle it.

whats worse is its driving me so insane that im researching about longevity and immortality, and how in longevity articles they say ai will bring groundbreaking discoveries but every time the feeling in the back of my head is telling me im coping and that there is nothing i can do to prevent it . 

all i can keep thinking about is death, i keep imaging people i see on the street 100 years laters we will all die at some point and its making me go crazy, i have never thought about death like this, whenever it was brought up or when i even thought about it. like i play gta, i watch shows and movies and characters die not a big deal it was never insensitive to me. its so insane i dont know what to do, does this go away?",1
post_00176,"my sister tried to kill herself two days ago. so. 

so. friday night, my sister took a whole bottle, 60 pills worth, of her antidepressants. beforehand, she had called around and apologized to a few people about things that i'm not privy to. this set off alarm bells, and somebody called emergency responders to the scene. 

when they arrived, they found her with a note, and... well, she survived. they took her to the hospital, but now she is in a behavioral health clinic. a state away. and we can't go see her. 

i am at a loss. i. don't even know if this is the right place to come with my story. or even what i want by telling said story. i just.

post_00240,"found and performed cpr on dead friend/looking for help i found my best friend dead from hanging herself just under 3 weeks ago now, i called the ambulance and untied her and gave her cpr for 12-14 minutes before anyone showed up. they ended up working on her for 60-90 minutes and got a faint heart beat back and she was put into an induced coma. i had to call her boyfriend and ex/best friend and we all spent the night in the icu. i spent a week in shock, meeting her parents who flew in from interstate. her father thanked me for giving them the opportunity to say goodbye to her. for the first  6 days it seemed there was such a low chance of her making any kind of recovery that we were just waiting for her family to decide to withdraw life support. i had begun grieving, although i was by her bed most days and evenings brushing her hair talking to her and reading to her from our favorite poetry books. on about day 6/7 they decided to take her off sedation and see what would happen and she ended up opening her eyes in front of me for the first time. it was a miracle, and it was also the saddest part reflectively of the entire experience. all she could do was lay and sob. i spent a few days with her like this. i would talk to her and i knew she could hear me because there would be certain things she would cry about and then certain things i would say would calm her back down. it was so incredibly painful. i was convinced over these days i had ruined her life by doing what i did. she was dead when i found her and that i had brought her back to a life of hell. it was my worst fear that she would stay in that state forever, i just couldn’t wrap my head around how incredibly unjust that would be. she ended up within 24 hours of having her breathing tube taken out and her sedation completely ceased able to start breathing on her own, speaking a little and even started moving. it’s all been so surreal. now that shock has worn off i’m having constant flash backs and panic attacks. i have constant invasive thoughts of killing my self. it’s so painful. i truly want to die, i feel so conflicted and invisible. because she is recovering our mutual friends almost have forgotten just how traumatic this experience has been for her first and foremost (and realistically this is only just the beginning of a very painful road for her...) and traumatised i am from finding her, untying her, giving her cpr while i knew she was dead, cleaning the blood off the door she was hanging from, and spending 2 straight weeks by her side through every single state in icu. i even moisturised her arms and legs so her scars would heal properly because nobody was doing it for her. i’m so heart broken. i want to die. i feel invisible and i don’t know where to put my pain. i have nobody because it’s too heavy for anyone to deal with, and all our mutual friends just want to focus on the positives that she is recovering which i understand but it’s like they don’t understand that she hung herself. i’m traumatised for life, and her life is changed for ever even if she does make a full recovery which who knows—she’s still very brain damaged and doesn’t even know what’s happened to her. i have never posted before, i don’t know anyone who’s had any kind of similar experience. it’s so layered and i have a 11 year history of self harm and drug use, both of which i had recovered from, years since i have self harmed and 3 months since i have used drugs or alcohol, but all i want to do is hurt myself in anyway i can.

edit: she had hung herself on the back of her door, so by opening her bedroom door that’s how she was released from hanging. i called 000 immediately as i untied the belt from her neck and checked if she was breathing or had a heart beat. all i did was find her and untie her and try wake her up realise she was very obviously dead/not conscious and call 000 and then do what they told me to until anyone arrived because i was in so much shock i was just doing what they were telling me to, even when the woman was like you need to somehow get into that room and i had to kick her desk back and squeeze my way into her bedroom i had no idea why the woman was saying she needed to be laid out flat on her back until all of a sudden the woman was telling me to give her mouth to mouth then i realised i was about to do cpr. i was screaming and crying why are you making me do this she’s dead the entire time and the woman just kept saying i know *my name* but just keep helping her until help gets there. so i did",1

post_06245,"i just overheard my mom talking on the phone when i came out to my mother as gay (13 years ago), she handled it very poorly. understandably so - she grew up baptist in a small alabama town in the 60s where there was not a lot of diversity. there were a lot of angry words between us, a lot of hurt, and it took a long time for us to repair our relationship. 

while she still doesn’t like to talk a lot about homosexuality (and i’m not totally out to all of her friends to save us both the headache), she supports me wholeheartedly and treats my girlfriend like another daughter and it’s wonderful. 

tonight i overheard her on the phone talking to a friend of hers and, while the conversation was (obviously) one-sided on my end, i could piece together the situation:

her friend found out that his child is gay and he is *not* happy about it. but after a few minutes, i heard my mom say, “charlie, do you want your child to be miserable pretending to be straight or do you want her to be in a happy, loving relationship? no, we don’t necessarily get the younger generations. things are a lot different now. but i would much rather my daughter be able to be happy and honest with herself than live a lie. [more conversation followed, but that was the best part].”

it really took me back. my mom is still really conservative around her conservative friends, and she doesn’t really speak up that often about things like this. it made me really proud of her, her growth, and our relationship. 13 years ago i wasn’t sure if i’d ever have a healthy relationship with my mother ever again, and tonight i heard her stand up for someone else’s gay daughter. 

and while she couldn’t be that woman 13 years ago, she was that woman tonight. and it’s just so awesome. i love her so much.

—-

edit: wow, guys! i had no idea this would gain momentum like it has, but after reading some of your comments and some of your stories i understand why. 

i just wanted to say that some of us seem to be very lucky with our parents who surprised us, and i hate to see that some of you are still in the closet out of fear of your parents’ response or had a terrible experience coming out. 

what helped me when i was 18 and my mom and i weren’t on good terms was to build my own family for support. it helped that i’d moved away to college and had new friends in a new town; they really helped me while i was essentially estranged from my mom. 

and when i came out to my mom i expected the worst and that’s what i got. at 31 now, i wouldn’t have taken that response off of anyone and would definitely cut them out of my life. but my dad died when i was 13, and my mom and i really aren’t close with the rest of our family. i think we both realized that we’re really the only one each other can rely on. 

a few years ago, i was in a terribly abusive relationship with another woman and my mom and i still weren’t on the best of terms. i had to move home to get away from that partner and spend a few months in therapy to fix the damage she caused. it was then mom told me that it didn’t matter who i loved. it mattered that i was a good person and that i lived with the values that my dad had instilled in me. i think she saw how dark of a place i was in and she was afraid of losing me, and that helped her come to the realization that i was still her daughter and she wanted me to be happy, and that was more important than who i was attracted to. that was really the turning point in our relationship to get it back on track. 

all that to say, some of your parents may never change. and i’m really sorry for that and i hope you can build a new family. but some times parents really can surprise you, and you never know what the catalyst might be for them. 

i appreciate all of your comments and kind words towards my mother; i’m so glad some people can respect and value her growth where her conservative friends probably would not. she’s still very conservative in some aspects, but since she’s been able to accept me she’s started coming around in a lot of other ways too. i probably won’t mention this post to her because she’s a very private person lol. but i know if she wasn’t, she’d appreciate everything you all said.",1

post_03640,"anxiety so intense it’s become depression: a story. 1 year ago i left my toxic teaching job of 10 years and started a new career.

6 months ago psychiatrist says i’m doing so well, let’s try to reduce seroquel bit by bit and see how we feel.  

3 months ago i have gradually reduced from 300mg to 50mg.  i’m doing great.

2 months ago we move to a new amazing city in an incredible house to be close to my job that’s making me so happy.  but i wasn’t happy.  i was anxious.  

1 month ago i made a very stupid and very public mistake at work and somehow didn’t get fired.  then another mistake.  then at home i left the gas on.  then a week later i caused a small fire.

from then on, i have been so consumed with the fear that i was going to make another mistake .  perseverating for hours.  crying when i even did the smallest thing wrong.  consumed with the idea that my partner of 15 years was going to leave me because i was such a fuck up.

a week ago i started crying uncontrollably all the time.

yesterday i made an emergency appointment with my therapist.  she said the magic words:  ✨hi5yourface, your meds are off ✨. her prediction was that my anxiety got so intense for such a prolonged period that i just burnt out and fell into depression.




the relief.  oh the relief that i’m not crazy.  that we just went too far down on the seroquel. i reached out to my psych yesterday and we’re upping it by 25mg, which started last night.  so i’m exhausted today and still tearful but oh hopeful.  prior to all this i was extremely stable on seroquel, trintellix, and lamictal.  adding seroquel was the only thing that pulled me out of a dark depression years ago, after feeling like i had tried everything.  psych made the argument that i was over medicated, hence the reduction.  i know that there is a magic in-between number that we’ll find.  

im about to try to go for a run, even though i don’t feel like it.  thank you for listening. ",0

post_05824,"i don’t think i have ever truly cared about anyone i consider myself a good friend. i moved around a few times as a child and still have a close friend group thats been almost a decade strong. i have a reasonable amount of close friends i made independently that have emotional depth and tough times/arguments we settled and moved on from. ive had romantic relationships that have lasted years with arguments, rough patches, and going through life changing events with. im very open about myself and am not afraid to talk about vulnerable topics. i always encourage the same from the people around me. i don’t only have good times with my friends despite that fortunately being the majority of my time with them.

i write all this to say that i feel truly feel disconnected. i have never cried about the loss of a friendship or a breakup or have even felt sadness. i have never wished for anyone back in my life or grappled with the thought of never talking to someone again. i never miss people-even boyfriends while we are dating if we go awhile without talking i dont blink an eye. i listen and remember things, make people handmade gifts at random, i bring people stuff when they are sick, i have been an advice giver and shoulder to cry on so many times but im truly just not invested deep down. every act of service for loved ones feels like it’s always just logical, transactional, or because it fits the moral code i run my life with. i just live my life as what i believe a hypothetical good person would do. i surround myself with beautiful, creative people that bring joy to so many others but at the end of the day i always believe everyone is replaceable. i cant remember the last time someone’s actions truly impacted me-i just know when i should be upset. and i frankly never understand when friends/partners get emotional about the people in their lives, i just know they want someone to pat their back and say they are there for them.

there is always a wall, there is always a lack of genuine care for everyone i meet. i dont hold back my thoughts and im always as blunt as possible so i dont understand why i never feel the layer of depth for people that i should. i truly feel so apathetic and get bored of people so easily but i just put on a mask of emotions every moment im not alone and all is right. im not depressed, i live an interesting life and have reached every goal ive set for myself, my life is filled with laughter, hobbies, and support. my head is filled with such narcissistic and shallow thoughts but i refuse to be the person in my head-i just wish it wasnt part of me.",0
post_06677,"last night was the first time in 2 years i slept soundly and i’m so proud of myself tw: mentions of past sexual violence

it’s been almost 2 years since i was gang raped and the recovery/trauma was crippling to the point where i didn’t think i would make it near the beginning. i’ve slept with a knife tucked against my hip and a bookshelf pushed up against my door every night since then and am lucky to sleep at all sometimes.

over these past 2 years i lost what little friends i had from the self isolation and depression but i came to prefer the safety of being on my own. i’ve had once a week therapy for about a year after leaving the intensive outpatient program, finally found good medication that works for me and a good doctor, things have really been looking up.

i by chance met someone who hadn’t been hurt by the world yet and for the first time i didn’t instinctively reach for my knife when he stepped towards me. i could see his eyes smile through his mask and he asked me all sorts of questions; what’s your favorite video game, what’s your dream, what are you majoring in at school? i answered this time, i let myself socialize and i asked him about his life, just as if life was normal.

then i went home and took a bath, had a nice dinner, and i fell asleep. it wasn’t until i woke up that i realized i hadn’t put my bookshelf in place or turned on the extra light. but i’d been fine, hadn’t i? nobody had come for me, there was no danger and that friendly stranger who smiled and laughed with me didn’t mean me any harm. things really are going to be ok and i can’t believe i’m finally on the other side. i’m here and i’m alive and i’m so happy.

edit: thank you so much for the awards everyone, and for all of the kind words, it really means so much to read the support and encouragement. i wish the best for whoever happens to read my post, may you heal and sleep well.

2nd edit: i didn’t think about putting a tw but i put one at the top and i’m so sorry to the people who read my post without warning of what it involved. you all are so wonderful and i can’t believe it got so much attention, i hope anyone else dealing with similar trauma can find their way out and see that it does start to get better. little by little, the day gets brighter.",0
post_01430,"i really don’t know anymore i don’t get it. like it’s not that the life i was born into sucks, compared to most people at least it doesn’t suck at all, i can get most of what i want, sure my dad sucks but really, nothing else does. i don’t get why i feel this way, why i feel so horrible still. i don’t know anymore. i have close friends. i have a sweet and caring mom. i can get most of the things i want. but i just don’t know why i can’t bring myself to be or feel happy anymore. maybe i’m selfish, i’m too greedy. but i really don’t know anymore. 

everything just feels so dull, i don’t wanna end it because i’m a coward and i’m scared as hell of death, but at the same time i want to disappear, never to be seen again, erased from everyone’s memory because at least that way, everybody can go back to doing their own stuff. what’s worse is that i hate how the only person i can rely on / vent to is also somebody who’s struggling, i just feel like a fucking burden all the time. i feel so pathetic and worthless.

at this point, i don’t think i feel that sad about it anymore, i just watch myself get worse and worse and smile because honestly, i think i’ve grown numb and found a sense of comfort in this pain, i think i’m just numb and it doesn’t surprise me anymore how fucked i’m turning myself into. i don’t know anymore. i just wish i wasn’t so attached to him. i wish he never said ily ever. i hate how i was the one who fell harder when he was the one who fell first. i wish i was gone.",0

post_05767,"i wish i had checked up on a girl i saw at a gas station i recently saw a couple at a gas station, and the interaction between them left me deeply uneasy. the man was in her face, holding her arm, and speaking to her harshly. she kept her eyes fixed on the ground, looking completely defeated. something about it unsettled me, and i couldn’t stop worrying about her. i tried to catch her eye, hoping to silently check if she was okay, but she never looked up.

as they left the store, he walked ahead while she followed, still staring at the ground. i wanted to approach her and ask if she was safe, but i hesitated. my kids were with me, she was too far away, and i didn’t know how he might react. even after they left, i kept watching them as they went to their car, and i couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong. i even told my teenager, who noticed my concern, that i was worried about her.

for days, i thought about them constantly. i found myself looking for their car whenever i passed by the gas station, even though i didn’t know why.

today, i came across their picture in the local news. they both died in a car accident. he was driving and apparently veered out of the lane for “unknown reasons.” i can’t help but feel in my gut that it might have been a murder-suicide, but i’ll never know for sure. i didn’t know them, and it’s not my place, but i can’t stop thinking about her. i wish i could’ve done something to help.",1

post_05518,"just feeling guilty. just came across a call recording of my ex bestfriend(m) whom i(f) had a crush on . our friendship got fucked up when another girl(call her a) jumped in the scenario. i didn't know much about her but i started being friends with her with my other friend(call her b) so then shit got messed up more and more . 
the a girl started dating my crush even after being aware that i liked him.  she just came and within 2 weeks he was hers. i got so stressed that i got sick. she made fun of it and said that i was faking it . she was always negative to me that i am flat and dark skinned while comparing herself to me and telling that she is better and ending it by saying it's just a joke. 
soon after they started dating i cut off contact with my crush because she was a bit jealous types but she wouldn't show it. and apparently he got very emotional and cried and stuff . so after that him and i rarely spoke . 
after some weeks their relationship started fluctuating. they used to take breaks and stuff . and whenever they used to take breaks he used to contact me saying i'm lonely and all . which obv i felt used . so one day that girl said smtg to me and she didn't clarify it which i should've maybe kept it with me .
 and soon after 1 or 2 months my friendship with a also started going downhill . soon i ended friendship with a . meanwhile me and b became close and we are still besties . after a was gone b told me about the things a used to say. i was hurt . but i let it go . and a's exes told me stories about her(which was basically her being a cheater), which i tried telling my crush so that he doesn't get hurt . but that day when i told he sort of listened to me and was nice. next day he started behaving rude and said those are all fake stories . i agreed to it and i just backed off .
 so i told this whole story including that unclarified text message . i told around 4 close ppl of mine. one of those close people was her current bestie(call her v) . but during that time v hated a and a hated v too . so while telling it just slipped and i told the whole thing to v . i didn't know v would go and tell everyone about that unclarified text. it spread like a wildfire and i wasn't aware of it. then my crush and a would call and ask why i did that . 
but actually it wasn't me who told anyone . and i would get so overwhelmed i would just avoid talking about it . only me and b knew that it was v but it was too late . i found out that v was the culprit an year after all this happened. i felt guilty about it . this wholeeeee thing has left a deep trauma on me and whenever i see any of them i go numb asf. nobody understands it . and i'm not saying i'm innocent in this whole thing , but i didn't intend to do that too . i didn't want to spread rumours about them but yeah . now i don't want to sort it out with them too . but i sometimes sit and wonder where did it all go wrong . anyways i didn't want a in my life . but that guy atleast as a friend maybe yeah. i wouldn't have dated him but that bond is gone . i was sooo cheerful and bubbly when it was him. when he was gone from my life , i lost myself too . 
now i'm happy in my relationship no doubt . it's not like i miss him in that way but i just miss him as a friend or atleast that he should've just been there if not involved in my life . i just wanted to get it off. any advices would be appreciated too.",1
post_06366,"my mother killed my sister  it happened just over five years ago. my sister was 23, i was 16. i was still living at home, my sister was visiting. 

our mother has always been... difficult. i don't want to diagnose someone, but she's always had mental problems. my sister had bipolar disorder, but actually took responsibility and managed her disorder. the two of them often clashed. 

i can't remember why it started, but they began arguing. my sister started preparing to leave, but had stopped just before going down the stairs. my mum shoved her. not hard, but just hard enough to cause her to lose her balance. she fell down the stairs onto the tiled floor. i still remember how it sounded. 

almost immediately, she started gurgling and seizing, throwing up as she bled onto the tiles. mum was screaming, i was screaming, she eventually called an ambulance. 

they took her away and we got into mum's car, driving to the hospital. we didn't talk, we were both crying. 

when we finally got to the hospital, we found out she was already being prepped for surgery. they told us to wait and that they'd inform us as soon as there was an update. 

a few hours later, a doctor came up to us. there was nothing they could do. my whole world crumbled. she was my big sister, my protector and best friend. she took care of me and loved me. i once read that losing your parent is losing your past, losing a friend is losing your present and losing a child is losing your future, but losing a sibling is losing all at once. 

it was only mum and i in the house that evening. we never talked about what happened. but i whenever i look at her, whenever i talk to her, i can just think *you killed her, you took her from me*. 

this is the fifth christmas without her. i keep thinking about who she would have been today. would she have gotten married to her girlfriend? would she have gotten her degree and followed her dreams? would she be proud of me? 

i've been in therapy since it happened and it's helped a lot. she was also an organ donor and the thought that parts of her are out there, making sure a handful of people got to live, is such a comforting thought. 

i should have told someone the truth about what had happened. but there was so much going on, my mind was in such a disarray that it didn't even occur to me. but it wouldn't have changed anything. my sister is still dead. 

i miss you, nea. miss you so fucking much. 

thank you for reading.

post_06721,"i'm marrying the man i met on pornhub so i(24f) started making porn content on 2018. to be honest it was purely from my low self-esteem and depression. i just wanted to feel validated so i started posting there and later moved to snapchat too. i was fully talking and sexting with hundreds of men and i was living for the attention. i honestly enjoyed the conversations more than the sexting. either way, this only lasted up to mid 2019 when i got too depressed to even make content, i stopped answering people and everything died down. i didn't delete anything since it was still making revenue.

one day around december 2019 a dude texted me on snapchat. unlike the majority of dudes, it wasn't a snap on his dick, he was showing me his cats. i have a soft spot for animals so i had to answer. then i realized he had texted me months before but it was when i stopped. i told him i didn't sext anymore so he could stop texting me but he said he didn't care and just wanted to talk. apparently he found my page on ph and wanted to shoot his shot on snap. i was very lonely at the time so i enjoyed talking. we started talking almost 24/7, he was funny, cute and very kind.  later in 2020 we started dating long distance. i was falling so hard it's crazy now that i think about it. up to this point i haven't told anyone i was talking/dating him. i eventually told my family i was in a ldr. i lied and said we met on reddit and since most of my friends and family don't know a lot about reddit they believed it.

we eventually met in person at the end of 2021 and i got the confirmation i needed that i was fully in love with him. he was so handsome and so good with my family and friends. also, even if you don't believe me we were both virgins (i was just a horny virgin wanting attention). we were each other's first time. he had to go back to his country and i realized how crazy attached i was to him. he later proposed on mid 2022 and we're getting married in december this year.

i still can't believe i found the one in the worst time of my life, we were both depressed and lonely and desperate for attention and eventually found each other in a shithole. now we're both better and so happy but i can't tell anyone our story so i just wanted to tell strangers here.

edit: i just wanted to say thank you to everyone for your kind comments, my fiancé and i read them and we love them and died laughing with some other.

and to the ones asking for my ph channel, it's all gone. i got it deleted so you can stop asking for it.",1

post_01809,"what hurts the most is when you really need to call somebody but you have nobody that would want hear you. i am so close to just running away and taking my life somewhere nobody can find me.

if my mother new what's going on inside my head she would have never said those things to me..
she probably doesn't know how close she is bringing me to just ...

and right there in my worst moments i wish there was somebody i could talk to, someone who would just listen, tell me that i'm not failure, not a burden to everyone around me, tell me that i am capable of doing what i love and that it's ok to struggle.
someone who tells me i'm not worthless and that my thoughts are lying to me.

but there is nobody.
just heavy, dark silence.

no one to hug, no one to just give me their hand, no one to just listen to me, no one that just genuinely cares about me..

post_06408,"i am never going on a trip with my girlfriend ever again i (22m) have a goal of going to all 50 states and last week i drove through arizona and new mexico. my girlfriend (23f) has never been out of california and asked to tag along and i said sure. we have been together for almost a full year and i have been wondering what she’s like on vacations and trips. i admittedly am not someone who will go on luxurious vacations. i will make sure i’m in a safe place but i don’t have a problem with sleeping in airports, bus stops, train stations, and libraries. this trip was nothing like that though. i found two day’s inn hotels with 4 stars and one of them had complimentary breakfast.

my girlfriend tagged along and complained for about 95% of the trip. she complained that my car was too small, the weather was too hot, the weather is too cold. “we’re staying at a day’s inn?😕 are there better places around?”. “these bed sheets feel weird and the a/c is too cold.” “this shower has a curtain??? ewwww”. “i don’t want to go to this restaurant, that restaurant looks weird, lets not eat there. “this is the grand canyon? i thought it would be prettier.” “albuquerque is ugly. why did you want to go here?” “i don’t want to go on a hike, i’ll stay in the car.”

any suggestion i gave was turned down. when i asked if she wanted to do something or go somewhere i barely received a response. she freaked out at a waitress because they made her order wrong and caused a scene. we went to the grand canyon and she didn’t clean up her garbage when we had lunch and said “it’s the park rangers job”. 

by the time we got home i was completely exhausted. i dropped her off and drove back to my house without music just so i could enjoy a period of silence. this trip opened my eyes into what she can be like when she isn’t 15 minutes away from our city. it was her first time out of state but she barely displayed any signs of common decency towards people and i ended up apologizing for her behavior multiple times. i should not have to apologize for my girlfriend’s actions because she received bacon instead of sausage. i’m exhausted.",0
post_02356,"i'm right about my feelings. i don't want therapy or to feel better, i've seen beyond the shadows on the wall. life isn't worth living, my dream my one dream i've had since i was a preteen boy, to be a father, is unobtainable. i am fundamentally unlovable, misanthropic and autistic. i cannot talk, or even type, like a normal person to people nor do i particularly care to make the effort to learn because humanity as a monolith is shit, that includes you. i genuinely hate you, whoever you are. you can masquerade as empathetic and kind but i know what humanity really is under your fucking mask. how you make the cruellest jokes at people's expense even though you know it's tender. how you'll put aside charity because you're ""hungry"" with starbucks in both hands. how ""mental health"" matters until it's really funny to not care. how you can rejoice at the death of other human beings because they're ""the bad guys,"" instead of hoping they improve. i can't connect with people anymore because i know under every niceness is someone that'd rejoice over my pain if i was someone, somewhere else.

there's no future for me, and even if there was i wouldn't care. i'm a loser neet now but i used to be an it technician, people would ask for my help specifically despite me being the most incompetent member team just because i was so kind. knowing i can't be that person again is what actually hurts, i think, that person could have been a father, a good one too. the person i am now is a cruel asshole. i neglected my ex for no reason. i have violent outbursts. i'm fucked.

but i just don't care anymore, i don't feel happy or sad. and if you were actually moral people you'd agree i should be allowed to die. i have plans but i'm a pathetic pussy and probably won't go through with it even though i should. i am right. and you, you fake fuck, can't convince me otherwise. because i know, i know, you know i'm right too.

post_03325,"gad/panic hi everyone!
i had my first panic attack when i was 18 years old. after which i developed generalised anxiety disorder. i have been on all kinds of medication for this, i live in the uk so sorry if some of these names don’t make sense to you! i’ve been on propranolol which really helped but because i had asthma as a child, there was some breathing side effects in the long run i went on fluoxetine, i don’t think that made any difference. i went on duloxetine, and i felt really awful on that. i’ve been on sertraline for a long time and was okay but i don’t think it really did anything?! i tried to increase it last year due to increased anxiety only for my anxiety to get worse with the increase so i struggled too much and went back down to 100 mg.

i had a very severe panic attack about a month ago that scared the life out of me, called an ambulance and i really thought i was dying. i was on the side of the road in my car screaming, i passed out when i threw up.  after this, i was quite scared to leave the house, i spoke to a doctor and she told me to try venlafaxine, she started me on 75 mg extended release. 

the first week felt okay, i just felt very very tired and sick. there was some points that i was crying because i was so exhausted even though i slept quite a long time.  i felt like i would never not be tired again. but i feel much better in that regard now however when i wake up in the morning my brain feels like it’s buzzing, i feel like my mind is racing but can’t actually track down a thought.. i have a lot of de realisation/depersonalisation which also makes me feel quite anxious. this seems to spike again about 2 pm, before calming down at about 5 pm. 

i’m struggling with brain fog and structuring a thought to get how i actually feel out. i spoke to my doctor today and i asked to come off of these, as i feel like i’ve been anxious for such a long time that maybe it’s not serotonin or whatever the hell else is in ssri or snri’s 😂 that i need. i’m not one of those that’s like i’m not taking any tablets unless i absolutely have to, i don’t give a sh1t, i just want to feel better.. i will be taking 37.5 mg for one week and then will be off. i have done cbt many many times over the years, and practice it quite often but i feel that nothing really makes us go away. 

does anyone understand, has anyone had this with venlafaxine? has anyone made it through without medication?

post_05196,"i feel like i’m caught in a place i never meant to be in. 
there’s this guy i’ve been talking to recently. he’s taken, and i knew that from the start, but we’ve shared a real history. we liked each other when we were younger, not just close—we had feelings, a connection. then life took us on different paths.

a few weeks ago, we reconnected. despite the distance, we had a night where emotions ran deep over a call—something intimate and vulnerable. we both admitted we didn’t regret it, but we agreed it wouldn’t happen again. there’s no future for us in that way; just two people reflecting on what we shared.

a few days after that, we tried to talk again. but he was all over the place—busy and surrounded by people. the conversation that night felt awful, and i ended up feeling empty. i addressed it with him the next day, and he said he’d make it up to me, but when i shared that i didn’t like his tone, he said he’d think about how to fix it.

then he followed up with a text saying he wanted to give me his full attention, but after that, he disappeared for a few days again. now he’s back, saying the past few days have been hectic and asking me to wait until monday to reply.

here’s the thing—this isn’t about me hoping for something more. i don’t. i don’t plan on being anything other than whatever we are now. but i don’t like the feeling that i have to adjust to fit into his schedule just because he asked me to. i was stressing myself out, trying to figure out how to express what i’ve been feeling. it’s been rough on my end—i’ve been overthinking everything, and on top of that, i’m trying not to cause a fight.

i’ve been through a lot recently, just getting out of an abusive marriage, and talking to him is more about the familiarity i have with him than anything else. he’s not a new person, but it feels like what we share means nothing to him.

now, i have to hold back again when i want to be upfront because he asked me to wait, and i just don’t want to start an argument.

i’m not looking to be an option. i just don’t like that i’m always the one adjusting and holding back because it’s what he wants, even if it means ignoring what i need to say.

what should i do.",0
post_05481,"going through breakup and don't know what to do i'm 26m and my girlfriend (27f) brokeup with me.
(i'm a software engineer and she is in last month of medical school to be a doctor)

sorry for my rant being long.


about 20 days ago my girlfriend of (5 months) messaged me and told me i'm a really good person and she loves me but she is not in love with me.

it came almost out of nowhere, i insisted to tell me a reason or we meet in person.
she told me if we meet  she is sure that i can change her mind.

to add context we had a forced breakup a month before this and it was because her parents found out about me and were against me dating her and told her to breakup with me and find another doctor to date ( reason being only a doctor can know and go through the struggles of studying for residency because her mother is a doctor and has gone through this)

we made up and almost a month passed but then this came.

i asked her for a reason and she told me she is in an state that feels she can't give back the same love that i give her and she feels her parents are  pressuring her to breakup faster, and she probably is not going to be loved the same way and better people are out there for me.

i just said why would i want another person when what i have with her is more than enough and we are happy.

our only contact point in this 20 days have been liking each other progress on duolingo and we both check each other twitter account ( basically stalking and tweeting about each other )

next week is her birthday and i don't know what to do.

today is my birthday. i am not big on birthdays, i don't like to celebrate it and in my opinion, this day has nothing to be celebrated about, being born was neither my choice nor my accomplishment.

anyway, i woke up this morning at around 4 am, which is not my normal time of waking up, and i had this tight feeling in my stomach and this sinking feeling in my gut like something bad was gonna happen, i don't know how to describe it.
i am not new to this feeling, i have had it for years, before every flight i had to take, no matter what time of day, before any meeting early in the morning (even if it is a casual meeting where nothing is at stake), even so much as if i had planned to do anything in the morning, i would wake up with this weird engulfing feeling. it used to happen everyday a couple of years back, but now it's reduced to only when there is ""something"" happening..any something. 

i always thought this is my anxiety but today, it's nothing today, it's a birthday but i have absolutely nothing planned, i live with my parents and they couldn't care less about this day and i really don't want to think of this day as anything special. why the hell am i waking up with this weird thing in my gut..is this what excitement is? am i subconsciously excited about my birthday?

post_04174,"does anyone else feel anger toward their parents for “causing” their anxiety disorder? as i have gotten older, i have started to realize that my parents(mostly my mom) have a lot to do with my anxiety. my mom has been all over me since i’ve been a little kid. she shit talks everyone, always points out my flaws, and in general has tried to control my life. 

this has made me anxious, insecure, and have a low self esteem. i can usually circle back most of my anxiety back to how she has treated me over the years. some of it came from bullying too of course.

my main point is that: does anyone else with a similar upbringing have any sort of anger toward their parents for some of the mental issues they might have caused? i am now almost 22 and i find myself upset with how my parents raised me. i am trying to pick up all the pieces and push myself in the right direction because in a lot of ways my parents failed.

edit: i am sobbing reading all of your comments. thank you so much for your support. i want to share more details of our relationship to get it “off my chest.” it was so toxic and i blame myself for so many things. we started dating the summer after high school, at 18. i went off to live on my university campus and he went to college while living at home. he visited often, and at this point of our lives, i felt like he was very insecure. i later found out that he lied and said he wasn’t a virgin, but he was, which made me a little uncomfortable. the summer after first year, i got pregnant and had an abortion in sept of first year. i was in a dark place and pushed everyone away. i found out 2 years later that he cheated on me in oct of that year—while i was suffering. i forgave him because i blamed myself for pushing him away. we were good. except when he was drunk. numerous times, he’d abuse me if i made him mad. i’m a feisty, sassy drunk so i made him mad a lot. he dragged me off the bed by my arms on vacation in mexico on my birthday. because i threw a shoe at him after he locked me out the room in just my bikini. on my birthday. he flipped a mattress while i was on it on halloween night. he also kicked me off the bed that night. another night, we got into an argument and i shoved him for putting his hands on me. he pushed me into a ditch. every time i said he scared me, he said i scared him too. i believed him because i did put my hands on him sometimes. most of it was self-defence, i think, i can’t remember those moments well anymore. he was unfaithful to me in many other ways and maintained a relationship with the girl he cheated on me with for at least a year after. he always said “i’ll change” for everything i brought up. but i loved him so much that i forgave him for everything. i would have done anything to spend another moment with him. but i’m choosing myself now. the day i left surprisingly wasn’t the worst of it. we were arguing about something and he grabbed a remote out of my hands. he verbally abused me so i started recording him and said “i’ll show your mom how you talk to me” and he stopped immediately. something in my head clicked at that point. that sudden shift of behaviour. and then he drove away with my wallet as i yelled “i’m breaking up with you.” the sad part is that he still doesn’t understand what he did to me. he said “you gave up on us.” that broke me. he started moving on the day after. he said there was no hope for us. and yet i still love him.",0
post_02597,"the logistics of killing yourself are so endlessly, frustratingly complicated i would literally attempt suicide right now if i thought it would work, but i just feel like i would just end up with permanent damage and be accused of being an attention seeker, when in reality, i just want to die quietly without any fuss. 

i hate hearing stuff like, *""if you fail, it's just a parasuicidal gesture""* and *""there are lots of ways to make sure it works,""* because sure-fire suicide methods are obviously not readily available to the vast majority of people. 

* do i try to poison myself with household products and probably just end up screwing up my organs?
* do i try to hang myself and risk brain damage? 
* do i jump off a tall building and freak out a bunch of people who don't deserve it?
* do i kill myself in the bath/pool and make everyone else feel weird about using it afterwards?
* do i lie to get a prescription i don't actually need and potentially get someone in trouble?
* do i gas myself and put others in harm's way?
* if i write a note, would that comfort people, or would it just make them feel like they could've ""done something"" and make it worse?
* should i ghost my friends before i do it to minimise the casualties? 
* is it better for my family/friends to find me, or some rando?
* what place/time would be best to prevent me from being interrupted?
* should i endure the pain and wait until i'm a bit older to kill myself so that i'm not seen as some immature, self-centred kid and people in my life don't blame themselves?
* if i survive, do i lie and say it was impulsive, and not like, years in the making?
* should i delete my sns pages and all the messages that i can before doing it?
* should i try between semesters in case i fail and need to take a break because i've messed up my health?
* would me killing myself destroy my religious extended family? 
* should i quit my job beforehand, or do i keep it just in case i survive?

there is no doubt in my mind that i'm going to do it, but i don't want to before i have a proper plan in place. partly to minimise the damage, but mostly because i'm just so very worried about the consequences of potentially screwing up. i don't even question whether or not this is what i really want anymore, it's just a matter or how and when. 

i wish this self-righteous society didn't censor 99% of helpful information that'll actually let me die instead of end up sick and injured. i wish i didn't have to feel guilty or selfish for wanting this. i wish people would stop spewing their spiritual and philosophical ideologies at me when they have f\*ck all to do with my personal situation. i wish people would admit that it's possible and even sometimes reasonable to want to kill yourself but not be depressed. i wish people would stop changing their tune about whether or not this will get better or worse with age when it's convenient for them. i wish it wasn't so hard and so morally taboo and so painful and so contentious and so risky to choose what i do with my own freaking life that i never even wanted in the first place.",1
post_05662,"my dog died terribly and i feel horrible lying to my mom about it. short little rant, but it feels like i need to tell someone. 

we took my dog of 16 years to be put out today. he was well past his time and suffering, and the date was long overdue. i arrived at the vet, they weighed him, and took him to the vets office. this is where everything kinda went to shit for my boy. he felt scared and didn't know what was going on around him, since he has trouble walking for too long so me and my family never take him on long walks, and when we go to the beach with him it's always quiet, so he's not used to many other people or strange smells. i was trying my best to calm him, but when the vet came in he was still rather anxious and it didn't help when they tried sticking a catheter into the top of his paw. he tried with his other paw to scrape it off and that forced the assistants to have to hold him down (he's a big labrador). after struggling for a few minutes, the vet told us to stand outside and he gave my boy a sedative.  
  
 we could hear him howling and crying from outside, and i felt terrible leaving him. when we came back in he was lying down hyperventilating with a catheter in his lower paw. the vet then injected the euthanasia, and look, i've seen dogs go to sleep before, but mine didn't lower his head peacefully and close his eyes, no, he started crying louder, and then the muscle contractions started, but he was still howling and crying out. the doctor quickly injected a second dose of euthanasia, but as he was doing it, his muscles were still contracting, so a big spurt of blood came out when the catheter opened up. it was harrowing watching him continue to cry out while his hearth stopped. it probably took around 2 minutes, all while the dog was scared, confused and feeling alone. the vet's best explanation was that the sedative slowed down his heart making the euthanasia take longer, which caused the botched attempt,  and that sucks. it was terrible to watch, but i'm glad i was with him until the end. 

i know how my mom would react if she knew. i told my dad how it happened first, and he told me i should tell my mom our dog died peacefully. i hate lying to her, especially when the truth is so much worse, but at the same time i don't want to upset her. this whole thing just sucks. it sucks that the euthanasia was botched. it sucks that my dog was not in a good space before or during. it sucks that i have to lie to my mom to keep her heart from breaking.

sorry if the writing is bad, i don't really care if this gets any engagement. i just felt i needed to get the truth off my chest, so i searched up this sub and viola. for anyone wanting to euthanize their pet, just make sure the vet knows what's its doing. ",1

omg wow this blew up. i’m so glad this is giving a lot of you hope. you can do this! i re-joined the sub following the advice of several commenters, i will stick around and try to help when i see posts where i might be able to offer some insight!! i left a comment below with some of the highlights that stick out to me in regards to what helped me heal, check it out. lastly, i am about to start getting ready for work but i will hop back on later tonight and get back to you a lot of you who have some excellent questions. ❤️❤️ thank you for all the support!!",0

post_00808,the tipping point one really wonders how people muster the courage to commit suicide. one day you are scared of even accidentally grazing your arm somewhere and the next day you jump off the top of a 10 floor building. how bad does life have to get for you to finally take the plunge. the hopelessness of life must completely overcome the fear of death for one to finally accept their fate. ,0

post_05891,"i accidentally conditioned my bf... i usually shower with the bathroom door open. i sing in the shower a lot. my boyfriend recently moved in and he started singing back to me when i’m in the shower.
if you know anything about crazy big curly hair, you know it takes forever to wash. so i have shower days that are “hair wash” days and it takes me so long! a couple weeks ago i was washing my hair and got bored of singing so i shouted to my boyfriend “i’m lonesome!”
he said he’d keep me company and smoke weed on the bathroom floor while i wash my hair.
every once in a while i’ll wash my hair and yell out “i’m lonesome!” and he just comes in and does the same thing.
i guess we developed this routine because today i said “i’m gonna shower” and he goes “hair day?” and before i answer he just starts packing his bowl and follows me into the shower, sits down, and starts singing.

i love it.",0
post_07214,"feeling lost and overwhelmed lately, i've been struggling to find a way out of the darkness that seems to have consumed me. it feels like no matter how hard i try, i can't shake off this heavy weight on my chest. the loneliness creeps in, and it's suffocating.  i look around and see others living their lives seemingly without a care in the world, while i feel like i'm drowning in my own thoughts. the pain of past traumas haunts me, making it hard to see a future worth fighting for.  every day is a battle against my own mind, against the thoughts that tell me i'm not good enough, that i don't deserve happiness. it's exhausting, and i feel like i'm running out of strength to keep going.  i long for some relief, a moment of peace where i can breathe without feeling like i'm being crushed by the weight of the world. the idea of ending it all crosses my mind more often than i care to admit, and it scares me.  i know there are people who care about me, who would be devastated if i were gone, but the pain feels unbearable. i'm lost in a sea of emotions, trying to find my way back to shore, but the waves keep pulling me under.  i'm reaching out here because i don't know where else to turn. i need help, i need a lifeline to hold onto when the current gets too strong.",1
post_02663,"people who say “it’s a bad day, not a bad life” are the fucking worst it is a bad life. do you rly think i wanna kill myself bc i had one bad day? fuck no. it’s because every single day of my life is a battle. every step, every blink, every breath takes so much willpower. 

depression can’t even be cured. people say it’s “not logical” to kill your self, but it really is for me at least. it wont get better. depression can only be suppressed. i’ll have to live with this horrible pain for the rest of my life. and the things in my life that make it worse are even more unbearable because they’ll never go away, no matter what some fucking stranger who doesn’t even know what i’ve been through says.

post_06509,"my dad kissed me i (27 f) am married, i have two wonderful kids, a kick ass husband & my own life. my relationship with my dad has most definitely had its up and downs. childhood was rough with him. he was a addict most of my life, definitely put the family through a lot of shit. i’m thankful he finally grew up at the age of 50. anyways to get on to the story.. 

my parents recently purchased the house right next door to mine. my husband and i have been helping them remodel it. it’s been a process. well i went over there yesterday with my daughter (6 months) to help. we were all sitting there playing with her & she kept acting “jealous” when my dad hugged me. he ended up squeezing me & giving me kisses on the top of my head to see her reaction. i’m not sure if it meant anything to him but it meant the world to me. i felt little again. i felt safe. i felt whole. it was such a nice feeling. it’s not like i don’t get love but getting love from your parents even as an adult is just the best thing in my opinion.

post_04456,"i finished a whole grilled cheese! lately my anxiety has been making it hard to eat full meals/meals at all. i’ve been barely choking down 4 bites of food at meal times and trying to supplement with nutrition drinks, all while feeling sick and nauseous almost all the time, and waking up starving in the mornings while still unable to eat much of anything. even my favorite foods would sound good in concept, but be nauseating once set in front of me. plus i was wasting so much food just trying to eat anything, and i hate things going to waste.

but today my dad made me a grilled cheese for dinner and i ate the whole thing! i could feel that terrible stomach feeling trying to overcome me every time i let my thoughts wander, but when that happened i would slow down and take deep breaths and remind myself that everything is ok, then try to distract myself in the dinner table conversation.

post_05869,"in case you didn’t know, looming around a woman you don’t know is just creepy. i went to my local park to smoke a joint before going to the library - i’m canadian so spare me the opinions, it’s legal - and i take a seat at a picnic table. it’s the middle of the day, clear skies and i pull out my phone to skip through the other bad habit of mine, reddit.

i’m always aware of my surroundings so i saw the guy further in the park, having a smoke. no older than his 30’s. he weaves a bit but he keeps getting closer so while i’m still going through my phone, i’m watching him in the corner of my eye.

threat detected.

he then leaves my view and i let him, because i don’t want him to know i’ve been watching his every move, and not because i’m interested.

then he says something from behind me. i turn and he asks if he can sit down on the other side of the picnic table. i tell him to go ahead and immediately turn back around and go back to my phone. i’m still aware of him but all he wanted was to sit down? that’s cool.

threat assessment downgraded.

i carry on with my joint and my phone and feel definite relief when he pops into my view again, walking away. excellent. i go back to my phone but then, not even a minute later, he’s coming back. dread sinks into my stomach when he once again, starts weaving back and forth.

that did it. thankfully, i was done and ready to head off anyway to a very public place. i was packed up and walking away in seconds and i’m a very fast walker. i don’t know if he followed me, i certainly didn’t stick around to find out.

here’s the thing about this situation; i fully understand that maybe he just wanted to strike up a conversation or something but i can’t and don’t care about that. 

it doesn’t matter and it isn’t important because he made me uncomfortable. the whole time. every second he stood there, maybe he was working up the courage to talk to me. 

but as a woman? the hovering and the fixation did not make me feel good; it made me feel tracked and watched, in a bad way.

i wasn’t scared but i also couldn’t enjoy my time sitting there because this guy was there the whole time and during those roughly fifteen minutes, just kept creeping closer and closer. i spent the whole time on guard.

if you want to say something to someone, just say it. try to be direct. what could be nothing more than someone working up courage can look very, very different to the person on the receiving end. also, zero regrets about how i handled that. i just needed to spew how i felt about it.

post_05803,"i (f 29) just squirted for the first time i can’t describe the shock on my face when i was masturbating to some cheap gossip girl sex scene with blair (leighton meester) and chuck. here’s the thing: i’m mostly straight. my partner (m 33) and i call what i have bi-curiosity.

but goddamn watching blair tease chuck in her tiny lingerie apparently did it for me because while i was using the clitoris part of my vibrator to only stimulate that area, all of a sudden my eyes rolled back and my vision went blurry and then i just heard this literal *squirt* come out of my vagina and then a gush of liquid leaked out of me. luckily i was on a towel when it happened but holy shit that was incredible. anyone know how i can replicate that? hahaha

context: i always used to struggle with a low libido except for when i was manic (i have bipolar). i’ve been on meds for the last few years, and while my bipolar has been managed, my libido has been something i’ve had to learn to strengthen since i can’t rely on mood swings anymore. so, squirting is huge for me.

post_06123,"my(15m) parents are mad i used my epipen on another person one of my classmates has an almond allergy, while i’m allergic to bee stings. we were out together with some other friends yesterday. he bought a pie without checking. it contained almond in it and he got anaphylactic. i checked his bag but didn’t find any epipen so i quickly used mine on him.

his parents were really glad he’s ok but then told him off for forgetting his epipen at home. meanwhile, my parents is now telling me off and saying it’s expensive, and that i shouldn’t have used it on him. even though i told them i’ll take part time jobs and buy a new pack myself since i only have one pen left now, they are still grumbling about ‘waste of money.’ i just don’t know what to feel now. i’ve already applied for and gotten a job as a waiter at a local restaurant this morning. 

i don’t regret what i did but i just wish they’d understand me.

update : following the advice of several commenters, i asked my parents to consider it from a different perspective. i told them to imagine if it had been me who forgot epipen at home and got an allergic reaction. i asked them how they would feel if another guy could have saved me but chose not to do so due to the costs.

that seemed to have done the trick as they said they shouldn’t have reacted that way. 

they then told me they will talk to my friend’s parents and see if my friend’s parents would replace the epipen i used.

update 2 : my parents talked to my friends’ parents. they told me that my friends’ parents gave them the money to buy a new pack of epipens.",0

post_05064,"the sun and the ocean i keep checking my whatsapp to see if you changed your profile picture. not because i am curious if you have changed it, but seeing it makes me instantly joyful. every time i open it; i find a new detail. there’ so much to see in that one photo. the room seems to be from a traditional house, probably your grandparents’ house in a sleepy town. there’s a painting of a gorgeous sun looming over an ocean in the background, the fiery bright orange of the sun, contrasted against the calming blue of the ocean. in the foreground, you are in your traditional dress, in one of those pleasing shades of blue which my limited vocabulary in colours won’t be able to put a name to it. the flowers on the dress takes me back to the smell of the spring. then there’s you! i keep zooming into the picture to focus on that faint, joyful smile of yours. it could light up a hundred rooms. you seem content in the picture, probably this was right after a wonderful meal cooked by your grandmother, something that she reserves for special occasions, and probably the special occasion was just you being around after a long time. you must be her favourite grandchild and i can see why. it’s your child like exuberance; it makes people miss you intensely if you aren’t around and brings out a weird paternal streak to protect you from all the perceived evil things in the world.

i will be fooling myself if i don’t confess the fact that i am intensely physically attracted to you. you are one of the most gorgeous looking people i have seen. the smile that your perfectly shaped lips hold, the faint dimples that appear on each end – like accompanying fairies surrounding the angelic smile of yours. if i had one last wish from the genie, it will be to make me funny with endless jokes, just so that i make you smile. the mole! let’s talk about the mole on your cheeks, the one that magically disappears into your dimples whenever you smile, only to come back proudly and gleefully, like it performed the prestige of an amazing magic trick. i have fantasized putting you to sleep on my shoulders and when you are semi asleep, i give you the slightest peck on that mole and enjoy the slight quiver your cheek makes with the faint muttering of gibberish aimed at me. don’t get me started on how soothing it is when you greet people, as much as the extra “i’s” in your hi’s makes me happy, the extra “e’s” in your bye’s makes me sad, i am addicted to these sounds, i wish i could record them and play them on suicide helplines. you mam, will be responsible for a lot of saved lives!
your eyes as beautiful and seemingly playful they are, seem to be hiding thousands of stories within them, probably the pain from your parents’ divorce, bullying from schoolmates while growing up in a different country, pampering and mothering your younger sibling to over compensate for the lack of love he received from your parents. i don’t know you well enough to know your pains, but it just feels like you have experienced enough. someday i wish to sit with you and know all about you - every little story of yours, to cry with you, to laugh with you and mostly to be proud of your strength and grit and at the end of it give you the barest of hugs that never ends, soaking in your warmth, the flowery smell, the softness of your skin and most importantly to let you know you did amazingly well. when i am done with the hug and slowly move your smiling face into my vision, i want to fill this cold, lonely heart with all the bliss it could take momentarily.

but, i know, this shall never happen. like the painting in your display picture, you think the ocean meets the sun at the horizon, but they never meet in reality. i don’t even know if you like me, or have a “thing” for me, or its just something that my brain came up with considering the default warmth you share with everyone and i mistook it for something that’s exclusive to me. i know that, if we are ever together, it’s not something that the society will approve of, you and i will have to fight our loved ones to be together, and something tells me that you cherish your loved ones way too much to let it all go for a stranger, who not only is way below your league, but is older than you, who doesn’t look as stylish as the friends you hang out with, who doesn’t speak your language or fit into your culture. but all i know is that i will keep you happy, because how else am i going to see your fairy dimples that will give me my dose of dopamine rush. as rumi says – beyond the idea of right and wrong, there exists a field. i will meet you there…someday!",0

post_07168,"lost in the abyss of pain  it feels like i'm drowning in an ocean of despair, struggling to reach the surface. every breath i take is heavy with the weight of my thoughts, suffocating me with loneliness and hopelessness. the world around me seems to be crumbling, and i'm standing in the midst of the debris, shattered and broken.  the darkness creeps in, whispering cruel thoughts of worthlessness and self-hatred. i find myself longing for an escape, a way out from this endless cycle of anguish. it's like a relentless storm raging inside me, tearing down any semblance of peace or happiness.  i try to reach out for help, but it feels like my voice is lost in the void, unheard and unseen. the pain is so overwhelming that the idea of ending it all becomes a beacon of twisted solace. the thought of not waking up tomorrow seems like the only respite from this constant torment.  i long to find a glimmer of light in this darkness, a reason to keep fighting, but the path ahead seems shrouded in shadows. how do i navigate this labyrinth of emotions, this maze of suffering? will i ever find my way out, or am i destined to wander aimlessly in this endless night?",1
post_05545,"honestly i’m sick of all this ageism bullshit when it comes to turning 30 seriously. it really isn’t that fucking old. **you’re** 👏 **still** 👏 **young** 👏 

it’s reasons like this my own generation (millennial, 1992, 32 currently) annoys me greatly with how much they contribute to the peter pan syndrome stereotype of turning 30. every time a new year this decade approaches? “ahhh 1995/1996/1997/1998 etc kids are turning 30!!!1111!!!” honestly i find shit like this just annoying and distasteful. 

it already doesn’t help that society forces you to accomplish everything in your 20s and will even deny you opportunities by the time you’re 30 if it’s too late. we don’t need more of these contributions. ",0

post_05486,"i think i have a fear of extinction im going to preface this by stating that i have insomnia that is brought on by major depression mixed with anxiety. a few years back i tried to remedy it by taking some thc gummies before bed, and at first they seemed to help. i would get high as a kite and i would drift off peacefully to sleep without any resistance. one night, instead of drifting off to sleep, my mind started to wander. at first it seemed more philosophical than anything, like “how massive the universe is” or “we can’t be alone out here”, pretty mundane stuff. but then my thoughts got dark, the thought of how every emotion i have felt, every tear i’ve ever shed, every experience i’ve ever had, family ties, everything that would pertain to me as in individual in this life is going to disappear when i die. 
i understand and acknowledge death as a natural part of the cycle, and the fact that i will be remembered helps some, but the notion that my consciousness, my entire persona, has an expiration date bothers me. 
i fell into a deep pit of deeper depression for a while after i had this realization and i haven’t fully recovered from the emotional turmoil this has caused me, but i’m managing one day at a time",1
post_03468,"my anxiety has returned and i have no idea what to do. i have dealt with anxiety for as long as i remember. i have vivid memories from 3rd grade of me being terrified to talk with the kids in my class in fear of not being worth their attention. school was always extremely overwhelming and i felt like i was always on edge.

this all changed my first year of college. my anxiety virtually disappeared, i think part of this was a because of leaving my parents house and having a fresh start. i still had worries about small things, but they were reasonable and i felt like i could deal with them. for the most part, i had confidence, felt good about myself and truly felt comfortable in my surroundings. i met some really amazing friends and even got a boyfriend. it was the first period in my life where i feel like i truly had clarity.

i won't go into crazy detail but this all changed in june 2024 when my best friend basically decided to leave me. it doesn't even bother me anymore and isn't something i think about, but it's just since that point that things changed.

it completely destroyed my confidence during the summer. i kept on running through scenarios of how i could have been better or what i did wrong to make her leave. it genuinely felt like a breakup. i was back home, which made it worse, and i just assumed it would get better when i got back to college. 

shocker, it didn’t go away. it got a little better last semester, and i thought i was working through it, but after winter break and returning, i have been crying almost consistently everyday. that tightness in my chest has returned, i physically feel like i can’t talk in my classes because of my fear, and i don’t feel like i'm worth anyone else's time.

the last three times i've done something in a group of friends i have started crying in front of them or ran to the bathroom to cry because i feel so overwhelmed. i don't even know what i’m crying about but once it starts i can't stop it.

this feels different than the anxiety i previously battled with most of my life. usually when i had panic attacks years ago there was some basis, or something causing the panic. now it feels like it manifests out of nowhere, and once it hits me it consumes me. i feel like some of it might be a mix of both anxiety and depression but i don’t want to self-diagnose.

i'm feeling overwhelmed, lost, and just looking for some advice. has anyone else had their anxiety almost vanish and then come back? how did you cope with this?

post_03133,"withdrawal sucks. how do you deal with it? i suffer from adhd and anxiety issues but never chose to get medicated till 2024. it got to a point where i couldn’t do it anymore.
i started taking xanax 0.25 mg per day for a week and increased it to 1 mg per day gradually. my strattera dose is 54 mg per day, started with 18-36-54. i took it for almost 4 months. never felt so good and calm in my entire life. but, i had to stop taking my meds (xanax + strattera) before my surgery. i was asleep for almost 2 weeks due to pain medication given for surgery.
once i started getting back to my normal life, withdrawals hit me like a truck. serious dissociations, zoning out, brain fog to the point where i’ll agree that 1+1=5 if you say so, emotional dysregulation. whatever i had before medication came back with 10x force. i thought the withdrawals will pass during my pain recovery med phase but it still persisted for over a month.

post_06837,"i wanted to kill myself today, but i decided to tell people how much i appreciate them instead everyone i’ve had a positive interaction with. even if i only met them once, or if we haven’t spoken in ages. anyone that came to mind, i messaged them and said thank you, and wished them happiness in the future and a great day today. i tried to add little stories that i remembered about hanging out with them if i had any.

i’ve always heard that when you feel like you have nothing, you should always try to remember the things you do have. so i spent 2 hours sending people (what is hopefully) a nice message for them to wake up to later today. i also couldn’t stop thinking about people like me who paint a nice picture on social media but are actually pretty miserable in day-to-day life.

i actually really do feel better now after putting positivity in the world instead of negativity. i didn’t self harm and i didn’t try to end my life.

yeah the feeling of despair hasn’t gone away, but now i can also remember that i’m not completely worthless, and i can still put beautiful things into the world too :)",1
post_03604,"the power of words this is one of the greatest skills i’ve learned that profoundly impacted my day to day emotional state. now i am content and at peace and (humor alert!) living in a state of a curled up anxious ball of c-ptsd is the indulgence of the past. 

words are really important. the stories (which are set of words) we tell to ourselves and to others reflect how we see the situation and determine how we feel about it. (how we feel = the quality of life) 

i’ve just noticed this pattern that all of my eq role models are highly tactful and use neutral/positive language to describe things. 

for example, instead of saying someone is  “stubborn” they say “dedicated”. instead of  “that person was controlling the meeting” they say “that person wanted the meeting to go good”. and so on. and both are true if you think about it. 

it’s just a shift of perception. in psychology it is also called “reframing”. i personally call it “resourceful thinking”, because essentially what’s happening is that you see the situation from its resourceful side. 

all perspectives are true, but our focus is limited. we never take in the reality at 100%, our brain has limited focus and must select  the most important bits of information. every second we are surrounded by 11 million (11,000,000!!) bits of information and our conscious mind is only able to take in 40 (just 40 bits — it’s 0.00036% of the reality around us). so our subconscious filtering out the rest in search of what could be important particularly for us. 

our subconscious beliefs run the entire show. someone searching for safety will filter the reality for possible threat, someone  searching for abundance filters the reality for resources, someone who is searching for peace filters reality for positive intent and so on. 

i kinda jammed two separate points in here. one is that the quality of life is greatly improved when we are tuned in to see resourceful side of things. and the other is that our subconscious runs the show and it’s safer for our nervous system to keep reaffirming old beliefs. 

but what i was trying to say is that what we get out of a story is not all there is to the story. just  imagine the quality of your life if you chose to skim the cream in every situation. and to do that starts with words and the emotional narrative behind them. 

choose your words like your life depends on it because it does!

post_01663,"on new year’s day, i wrote the first half of my note. five out of these past six years have been nothing but hell for (24m) me. it’s just been nothing but failures, self-loathing, weakness, sorrow and loneliness. 
* every goal that i set to do, has been slowly burning away. either due to failure and my inability to find a competent alternative, or simple inactivity. when i fuck up on one thing, i sort of obsess over fixing it and i ignore everything else. 
* no matter how hard i try, i don’t amount to anything. my existence or presence is never enough! kindness and sense of humor is not enough for good relationships:
    * my interpersonal, logical and even emotional intelligence is in a very poor state. i end up portraying the funny (and i’m barely that), but idiotic buff guy or the hard, vapid and shy dude in my friend groups. idk if i’m on the spectrum or just have social anxiety & general awkwardness. not to mention, i’m not very innovative or astute. 
    * i’m look much to look at. i don’t have pretty eyes, nice hair, a good sense of style or masculine charm at all. i’m 6’2, deep-voiced and muscular but overweight. (even with all of my dieting and exercise, i can’t escape being that fat, ugly kid with a constant chip on his shoulder) i’ve a lot on not being bitter, it’s poisonous. although, there’s still a good dose of edginess that’s still curdling. my resentful, vindictive and determined, yet brutal thoughts are a testament to it. that’s why i try to keep it in control, because i’m scared of that fragment of me.
    * confidence is a concept that i’ve never fully grasped. my athletic ability, intelligence and personality have never been things that i can count on. sure, i can feign confidence  and i’m exactly afraid of making mistakes…but i’m afraid of making myself look weak or trash at things. do you know how many times a day that i think about building upon my interest or even ask more girls for her number, but never could because i’m a fucking pussy?? finally, it’s began to fuck with my identity. i’ve started to paint the persona or me that’s “interesting” and “unique”. let me just say it now: i’m not this caribbean dude with this interesting story on how i got here, i’m just a regular black guy from the midwest. there i said it! 
    * never had an actual gf. i’m not a virgin but i haven’t experienced any form of strong intimacy in a very long time. where somebody understands and trusts me as i do them. you know? as i list all of these things, no wonder nobody wants to date me. i’m not confident, super disciplined, ambitious or assertive (i stand up for others but rarely for myself). nothing about me is manly or worthy.
    * lastly, i basically fucked up my future because i was too weak to adjust to my overall grades are definitely not graduate school quality. to think that my cretinous-ass could be a neuropsychologist. plus, my parents think that i’m graduating this semester. i just told them that to ease their minds from their funds.at the moment, there’s no future in sight that i want to experience. 

“listen, i’m going to give my absolute best attempt at achieving something significant in this life, but if i’m unsuccessful…december 31st, 2025 will be my last day with all of you. i’ll write out the goodbyes, the apologies and that’ll be it. remember when i told you that i don’t break promises, well i made this promise to myself at 18 and i intent to keep my streak! the least pussy thing that i’ll ever do is be a man of my word, right? you can find me on the ceiling in my room, you can’t miss it.”

i grew up with noone. dad hated me and hit me till i bled. mom ignored me and kept 3 cats around despite me being severely allergic. i grew up wheezing and barley able to move. developed so much lung damage i got diagnosed with copd young

grew up repeatedly sa'd by my brother's and grandma. was told it was god's will and i needed to accept my struggles

grew up severely bullied at school and called and it and a thing often

developed pcos at 16 and have been fat, balding, and swollen with edema ever since. so i've never been beautiful. never had a chance to be

was in an abusive relationship for 3 years. was hit to the point of miscarriage and constantly called stupid and unloveable

grew up awkward but had lots of acquaintances because my shyness made me soft spoken so i was considered nice but only had 3 friends(i originally put two because i didn't count a friend who moved to texas when we were 12 but she has genuinely kept up with me until recently so i will count her). these friends haven't responded to my texts in about a month or 2

i'm turning 30 soon and my only wish is that these lung problems will consume me and i die. i want to just die already. i want this life to be over. i have no good memories. i just want to be released. i want people to know who i am yet also want to disappear. i wish i'd had something. some sliver of hope but i don't. i have nothing. i'm laying here wheezing. had slept for 14 hours and still exhausted. i hope i die. i hope for that release

post_05152,"friend said some things; realized i don't really know who he is, and now i'm overly worried about him tw: very brief mention of suicide. im sorry i tried to flair it but i really don't know how to do that

forewarning:
long story/rant since this has been bothering me for the last couple days and i feel like i'm going a little insane since it seems like i'm the only one who thinks it's kind of a big deal

tldr: my friend seems super lonely and also kind of depressed but nobody else seems to really care about it except for me



last weekend, i went out drinking with a couple of friends. it was a great night; went to a couple clubs, met some new people, watched my single friends talk up some girls, watched my taken friend get yelled at by his girlfriend for something he didn't do. overall, a fun night with no hiccups. 

at the end of the night, all of us except for my taken friend and his girlfriend ended up crashing at a friend's place. everyone was pretty much passed out drunk, except for me and a guy who i will refer to as k from now on. 

i've only known k for about 2 years now and met him through a mutual friend who's known him for like 10 years or so. we're all in our mid-20s so it really wasn't so difficult to get close with these guys, but k was always kind of a little different than the rest. he wasn't ever reclusive or anything like that but i only really noticed this last week that i really do not know anything about this guy as a person. i knew how other people saw him and other surface level stuff like what he does for work and who he hangs out with and things like that but i literally do not know anything else.

anyway, while everyone else was pretty much passed out, k and i were the only ones still awake. it was around 4am and i was texting my girlfriend still drunk out of my mind while k was probably the most sober out of all of us even though he had gone the hardest the entire night. he's always been insanely strong with alcohol and drugs and stuff so i never really thought anything of it. 

while i was telling my girlfriend about the night, k got up and started cleaning up. bottles, food, plates, garbage, just the usual stuff. thinking back now, he's done this every single time i've seen him after we got drunk for the night. i even remember one time he woke up in the middle of the night after getting absolutely piss drunk just to start cleaning up while everyone else was still trying to survive. i've asked him and our other friends about it before and all of them have said that that's just how he's been for as long as they've known him. k told me he just does it because why not. it was a little weird to me but i never complained about it because having someone clean up afterwards was pretty nice to have. 

anyways, while he was cleaning, i mentioned it to my girlfriend on the side as a joke that the night was officially over because k started cleaning. my girlfriend joked back saying she'd come over right away to keep the party going. k heard it and laughed mentioning he still had half a bottle of hennessy for the 3 of us and for my girlfriend to pull up. 

this was when i kind of asked a joke question, asking why he goes out of his way to clean up every time when we could just get our other friends to do it so that they could make themselves useful for once. 

k responded saying he does it so no one else has to and it was like something in brain just flicked on. 

for as long as i've known k, he's been the go-to guy when it came to handling other people. he would preemptively offer rides in case people couldn't find one, offer to pay for people's food and just have them pay him back later when they could afford to, take care of people who got super fucked up during raves and nights out and parties even though he would get super fucked up himself. the thing is i've never seen anyone ask him to do any of this. even right now as i'm writing this i realized how much money i probably owe him in gas and food and drinks. and he's never asked for any of it.

i don't know why but i suddenly felt so bad for him that out of nowhere i him if he was okay. he replied the way he usually did which was laugh, smile at me, and then say could be better, could be worse. 

i followed up with something along the lines of ""for real are you okay?"" 

he instantly looked away and just said ""no but can't do anything about it so we keep going"" and then kept cleaning.

it was quiet for a little bit after that until i got a text from my girlfriend who was still on call with me. she basically just told me she was gonna mute herself but stay on call and that i should ask him all the questions she was about to write out to me.

now, my girlfriend has known k for way longer than i have and we basically only got together because of him so when she told me to ask the questions she wrote down that's when i realized that this dude really doesn't talk about himself.

it was mostly questions about how he's feeling and a lot of it were repeat questions worded differently. stuff like ""how are you feeling right now"" and ""you can talk to me about how you're feeling"" and ""if you want to talk about anything i'm pretty good with stuff like that""

he didn't give any actual substantial answers for most of them until i straight up just asked him ""why do you do the things you do?""

he said ""i want to be everyone's last resort""

this phrase has been what's been fucking me up the last couple nights. usually people want to be the first choice and k was literally the only person i've ever met who's said something like that. and i genuinely believe him.

when i asked him to explain what he meant by that he said something along the lines of how everyone needs someone and sometimes some people don't have someone. naturally i followed up by asking him if he had someone like that. without missing a beat and without even looking my way he said ""i hope so, but it's okay if i don't because i'll be that someone for me."" 

after this we didn't talk anymore and i ended up asking my girlfriend to pick me up. 

the last couple days i've been going around to mutual friends asking about k and the general consensus ended up being jokes about his alcoholism and drug use. i would follow up asking if they seriously think he had problems with that stuff but everyone just said probably not and that he just likes to party. still though this has been bugging me nonstop. 

and then just last night i asked my girlfriend to tell me more about him and during the whole thing she told me that he tried to kill himself 3 times in the 7+ years she's known him. and apparently the only reason she knows is because he'd offhandedly mentioned it to her after they'd gotten super high because it was part of a story he was telling. 

i've been so angry and hurt and sad because of this and i don't know what to do. k is 100% the nicest guy i've ever met and it's not even close. and it's not one of those weird overly nice kind of vibes. he just seems to be genuinely himself and everyone around him seems to love him because of it. he's a good looking guy, super fun and outgoing, and he takes care of everyone. every time we go out there's at least 1 girl who talks to him and they always seem to hit it off but despite that he never gets with any of them. i've asked him about it before and he always just says they're a great person but he's got someone else he's into. i even had a phase where i was worried the girl he was into was my girlfriend and i confronted him about it but instead of getting mad at me for being insecure he just told me everything about the girl he was into and who it was. he even apologized to me for making me uncomfortable enough that i had to confront him about it. this was almost a year ago now.

i honestly don't know what to do with how i'm feeling anymore because no matter what it feels like everyone has kind of just brushed it aside saying that's just who he is. but to me it's starting to feel like he's super lonely and depressed and he does everything for other people. nobody could even give me a proper answer for who they thought his best friend was. it's like this guy is just a ghost to everyone except he just likes to party. 

i don't know if im just overthinking this or what but it's really been fucking me up and i just needed to let it out and maybe someone can just tell me straight up if i'm being stupid about it or not

post_05087,"estranged from dad i've always had a good relationship with my dad. he and my step mom have had their struggles with alcohol, which created the only problem we've ever had, but otherwise all has been well. we called each other often and visited when possible as we've either lived in different states or at least a couple hours away. i moved again 3 years ago. then a little over a year ago, my dad and step mom moved too to be closer to my sister and i. 

my step mom has always had a complicated relationship with her family but it was understandable so it seemed reasonable when she slowly started to cut them off from her life. i should have seen the red flags. 

christmas of 2023 my dad and step mom are very upset and say they're essentially having a problem with my sister. my sister is great and i promise she hadn't done anything offensive. i reassure them it's a misunderstanding, we all have a talk, and move on. 

july 2024 we all go out to visit them. me, my fiance, my sister, her husband, and new baby. mind you, their house is a 9 hour drive away, which i didn't care about at the time. the visit goes well mostly. they say it's our vacation and to do whatever we want and suggest a bunch of things in the area. my step mom seems so excited about all her new friends though and has all these get togethers planned. notably, she has started drinking again socially.  so, we go to 4 out of 5 of the parties. the last one, we were just so tired and wanted a quiet night as it had been a busy week. also, my dad hadn't attended these parties. after that there was a mood shift. but we still go and have a day at the lake and hang out as a family. the trip wraps up and we go home.

my sister sends a message once home saying thank you and we'll see you again for halloween like we planned. two days go by before my step mom replies, not my dad. she says we were terrible house guests and we need to take time apart to decide how much we want to be in each other's lives. my sister and i are shocked and confused. we cooked meals, cleaned the house every day, and left everything in perfect order so that's just blatantly not true. we also aren't loud people who are being a disturbance, actually step mom is way more loud. anyway,  we know at this point this is her cutting us off as we're the last remaining family. my dad didn't say a word. i directly asked for his input and she said ""you won't be hearing from (insert dad's name) any time soon"", not my dad, his name. according to her message, he was too aggrieved to talk to us. so we have no idea what was said to him. she immediately unfollowed us all on social media. 

anyway, we figure maybe they need a month or two and they'll be open to talk. nope. it has now been 7 months and nothing. they didn't acknowledge either of our birthdays, halloween, thanksgiving, christmas, new years, nothing. we sent a message on halloween and sent a christmas present, i also tried calling today so we could just have a conversation and be done with it. he didn't answer. i'm not surprised but i'm really disappointed and sad. 

my wedding is in less than 2 weeks, which i did invite him to, and i know he's not coming and it's just so messed up. my sister and i talk several times a week and just comb through the whole situation trying to understand what went wrong and the fact of the matter is, we didn't do anything wrong. and i know i'm biased but i'm telling the truth. we missed one get together but that was it, dad didn't go either. i just know something was said to him that isn't true but it's so hurtful and offensive that he would just believe whatever it was about us and not even care to tell us what the problem is. especially given that our relationship has been great until this. we've also never had any real issues with my step mom, she's been around for 20 years, she was family. 

i'm just having a very hard time accepting this. i know it's a little existential but our time here isn't guaranteed and it would be such a shame if something happened before we resolved this. it's literally so stupid. i feel like i'm grieving a death but really, my dad is just ignoring me and i don't know why. and i can't believe a guy who has stressed the importance of family all our lives would just let this happen without a word. anyway, i guess that's all. i'm just having a hard day and needed to type it all out.

we are literally all shallow apes that are simply searching for the best fuck to get the best offspring, then half of us look for the best pushover to raise the best fucks kid. it truly doesn't go deeper than that. there are plenty of sidequests along the way sure, but the fundamental path we are set on by our biology is pretty much decided at birth.

modern concepts of love and romance are just shit we made up to try and collectively gaslight society into keeping our animalistic side deeply buried, and the fucked up part is, it worked. it worked so goddamn well, that we actually believe we are better than animals. we just aren't lol. we are animals. a little smarter than our peers, sure, and we have a little less hair than our cousins, but we are fundamentally the same.

no one is honest with themselves or others. all you have to do is observe someone's behavior, listen to what they say, and you quickly realize that something is very fucked up here. why are people so unhappy? why are suicide rates climbing? why are people contradicting themselves from the day they're born to the day they die?

because we are all a bunch of mindfucked, repressed monkeys that don't understand why we feel so miserable. it's really that simple.

humanity is ugly. people are fundamentally stupid on average. they go through every hoop to always be right or save their ego or believe what they want to believe regardless of new information. they don't know how to think. they only know that they feel a certain way and nothing else matters. you selfish braindead fucks. they aren't concerned with truly understanding other people: they're more interested in putting themselves on a pedestal and damning any negative behavior from others and classifying them as irredeemable. they aren't interested in empathizing: they're interested in projecting their own emotions on someone elses experience, and they genuinely think they're a good person for it, declaring themselves ""empaths"" and participating in this disgusting masturbatory ego trip while patting themselves on the back for emotionally splooging all over themselves. fucking yikes.

post_02751,"i just realised that people don't really care about my mental health. they just care that i'm not a whining bitch anymore. ive learned how to supress my emotions. no more crying. no more screaming at the top of my lungs when i'm in pain. no more hitting myself when i'm angry. no more panic attacks in front of others. i'm still in just as much hurt as i was before, now i just know nobody wants to deal with my bullshit. 

and you know what? fair. not even i wanna deal with my bullshit. but at least don't act like you do care when you don't. nobody tried to help me solve my problems. they pretended they did. all they did was get me to a point where my problems were no longer anyone else's problems and called that me ""getting better."" despite the fact that i am very visibily just as equally as bad as i was before. 

i swear this is just even more proof i'm seriously just a burden. my silence has seemed to drastically improve the lives of those around me. so imagine what literally just not existing could do.",0
post_03319,"anyone else get seasonal anxiety? around this time last year (mid feburary) i had a horrible relapse in anxiety that lasted up until march. i attributed it to hormones or pmdd (i have anxiety before periods) but it was pretty rough. it started again this year after new years, and it’s been absolutely unbearable. heart racing, dp/dr, mood swings with crying, feeling like something bad going to happen all the time. it’s so bad i have to have my partner drive me everywhere because i get so anxious while driving. i’m a stay at home mother and being at home is the only place i feel some type of relief currently, but then i get anxious when i think about “what if i never get better”. i currently take lexapro and have an rx for buspar but i’m terrified to try that. i have a psych appt on the 18th but i’m just posting for reassurance to see if anyone else experiences anything like this. i should also note, i moved to the midwest last year which is when this all started. i lived in florida before",0
post_06424,"my boyfriend (25) thought i was asleep... the other morning i was really sick. it was my time of the month and (due to pcos) i was in a lot of pain. i stayed home from work and spent the night using my boyfriend as a heating pad. he babied me all night and did whatever he could to take care of me. i ended up falling asleep in his lap. he moved me to my spot in the bed, which woke me up, but i was enjoying him doing this that i shamelessly faked being asleep.  he laid down behind me, wrapped his arm around me, kissed my forehead, and said, “baby i love you so much. you mean the world to me. thank you for making me so happy. i hope you feel better. i love you.” i had to fight back tears. i didn’t mention to him that i heard it because i’m afraid he’ll stop doing it. i’ve been struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts my whole life but hearing this made me feel at peace for once.

edit: i know there’s some of you that don’t want to believe this because the title is “clickbait” and “this has been posted before.” i understand that and i hate that people have become so numb to this stuff that they don’t believe it can happen commonly. admittedly, i didn’t even look through the sub before posting. i was swooning and caught up in my feels and wanted to share. i figured that with all the negativity going on in the world, along with all the mental health struggles i have endured myself, posting something happy and positive would be a good thing. obviously i can’t force anyone to believe me but i wish people would try.

post_03129,"heart palpitations i ( 19f ) started having heart palpitations in december 2023. on that day i woke up and was just chilling and i decided to start vacuuming. when i was about to turn the vacuum on i felt my heart kind of skip a beat and i ”fell” to the ground. then i decided to just ignore it and tried to continue the vacuuming but every time i stood up it would happen again and eventually i was crawling on the ground to the kitchen to drink some water. i kept having these palpitations for the rest of the evening but they subsided a little bit after i some pizza but they still kept happening. i’ve been having them ever since and they come as ”palpitation attacks”. sometimes i’ll have multiple like 5 in a row. i’ve noticed that not eating triggers them but i still get them even if i have eaten. now a new symptom i’ve developed around december 2024 is tachycardia. i can be lying on the couch just watching netflix and my pulse will suddenly go to 140-150 and i can’t calm it down. i’ve been to the doctor multiple times. my blood work and ecg were fine. they said it’s just anxiety. but idk… i feel like the physical symptoms are causing my anxiety not the other way around. i’ve started to become afraid of doing things in fear of palpitations. i’ve been away from school for 3 months because of my palpitions but yesterday i finally decided to go and my pulse was 130-150 for hours and i felt so horrible i had to leave. what do i do? i can’t live like this anymore. i feel paralyzed and they say it’s just anxiety. i don’t even know what’s causing my palpitations. another moment where they have been happening is when i take a shower and i crouch in the shower. my palpitations feel like a skipped beat or an extra beat or sometimes a loud thud, or like i have butterflies in my heart. other symptoms i have is nausea, weakness, no appetite and just overall feeling unwell. my resting pulse is sometimes 100-120 even if i am just lying in bed doing nothing.",0

post_06383,"i lie to dead patient's relatives to relieve them of their guilt i'm a er doctor and today i had yet another patient who died of cardiac arrest and i was responsible for informing their loved ones. it was a sudden and unexpected death and those are the hardest. when the relatives arrive they usually haven't really grasped the severity of the situation and that was the case also today. i usually start off by asking the relatives what happened or what they saw and understood, to see where in the process they are. have they figured it out? are the news about their loves one's death going to be a complete surprise? 

in many such instances i hear of spouses saying that their partner fell unconcious and they didn't know what to do, so they called an ambulance and waited. or they tell me that their partner had complained about symptoms (for a medical professional) clearly relating to or indicating something dangerous was up but they didn't understand it and they never sought medical attention. (i live in a country with incredibly cheap and accessible health care, so that is never an issue.) 

no matter how little or how late the relatives reacted i always assure them that no matter what they would have done, the outcome would have been the same, even if it isn't true. i want to spare them from carrying the guilt for the rest of their lives. so far i have't ended up in a conversation where this approach hasn't worked due to the fact that even the relative has figured out that they could actually have done something to prevent their loved one's death, and i pray that never happens.",0

if you’re starting quarantine or are obligated to stay home just like we are, i promise you’ll get used to it. and not used to it in a negative way! there are so many things you can do at home: i baked so many cakes, i’m trying to do the splits, i’m reading all the books i never got a chance to read. isolation is reaaally not that bad.

we have the amazing power of adaptation. every tool you have learned to cope with your anxiety will come in super handy, and you’ll see how strong you are with them. sometimes i imagine covid-19 as the boss level of anxiety, and it gets me super pumped lol. it makes me want to kick its ass so much.

it’s a wild ride but if us italians are riding it out, you’ll ride it out as well!
sending you all a giant hug. we’re in this shit together.

and please, remember this pro tip: check what is necessary to check on the news. and that means check only what you as a citizen need to do. numbers will go super high, then super low, then high and low again... it’s a pain that you really don’t need in your everyday life. if it’s impossible for you to resist the urge, have a trusted loved one tell you the necessary things you need to know: if there are new limitations, if you can go to school / work , what you should do with your hands etc.

post_04573,"does anyone else find themselves having anxiety about having to get up early in the morning? i'm 27. i've been trying to get to the root of my anxiety and this morning, while driving to work, it dawned on me (no pun intended) that the source of my anxieties might have to do with my disdain of having to get up early for work.

i have a problem where i can't stop thinking about work during weekends, when i'm home at night, on vacation, etc. work dominates my thinking, but in an unproductive way. i don't go over anything specific, i simply ruminate about the fact that i have to do it. a lot of it has to do with my disdain of not being able to have full control over my time and having to sacrifice so much of my life to a job.

i typically end up having a decent day at work, nothing wild. every now and again i'll have a hell day. i often fear having those days, weeks in advance, and they typically never come, but they eventually do. 

going back to my time, a massive hurdle for me is accepting that i need to get to bed early so that i can have enough energy for the following day. there is something about that...and it makes me feel powerless. it feels like the rest of my life is just a waiting room for work but i realize how absurd that sounds. i know it's untrue, but we also live in such a hyper industrial and profit-addicted capitalist society that i know (unfortunately) that what i'm saying has some form of validity to it, and i wish it weren't so.

currently, receiving  any mental health is near impossible because my health insurance doesn't cover any resources in (or remotely close) to my area, (and i can't afford the funds to travel out if i had to).

i turned to god in my darkest times, who continued to promptly ignore me **and actively made things worse immediately afterward.**    felt like i prayed to demon or something. so turning to god/faith is absolutely out of the question. i'm done tearfully pleading my case to the ceiling.
 

living each day is like a chore. it's not living. it's nothing but soul-crushing days followed by sleepless nights. self confidence? never heard of her. if i had a clear path out, i'd do anything i could not to be me.

post_03262,"a stalking incident made my anxiety and fear spike i tried to tell my story in other subreddits, but i guess there's no help for me. anyways, here's my story.

i used to write reviews, post artworks and join in online communities ever since i was a teen. i had no one who really shared similar interests with me, so writing and doing art, or being active in general made me really happy. i was too stupid and naive that i would write a blog about my interests and my life and enjoyed the feedback i got from my friends there. it was good, until one day it wasn't.

one of my college friends had added me on a platform. (in college, after high school i had finally gained a lot of friends in and out my class and finally found places in which i could express myself offline too- touching grass!) she wanted to become a micro-celebrity of a kind online, and she had started to use that platform frequently. we weren't close but i accepted her request nevertheless, thinking it would be cool to be friends.

someone on her friends list found me, and started to stalk me. at first, it wasn't apparent, and i didn't know this person or when it started, but i came across her profile and saw that she copied info off my profile completely, treating it like her own. i confronted her about it, which only made things worse.

she started to find every single account i have and copy everything off them. my reviews, my art, artist name and signature, my interests, the way i type or talk to my friends, my uploads and profile pictures.. she wouldn't stop. she was also posting some things as passive-aggresive threats that only i understood. i got scared. i thought she would find my place, job, anything, and hurt my family too, because her psychopathy level was nearing that line. she enjoyed my fear. i was too anxious too function, and still kinda am. nothing helps.

i hid everything i have. stopped writing, posting at least. painting. but even though i stepped back, now every interest i had reminds me of this incident which is still going on and i forgot to enjoy everything. i tried picking up new interests, offline and with my friend group, but i am so scared that she will somehow appear and snatch everything from me. i am always scared now, and i am tired of being scared. i can't do anything without getting overly paranoid and anxious- too much even to think about the thing i am doing. nothing is the same. i feel like a stranger. 

i don't know what to do anymore. any kind of support or even advice is appreciated.",0

some of you however are like me, the light that once flickered is now completely shut off. completely detaching you from this world, making you a worthless entity.

i am a nihilist, that is my view on the world, i believe things matter inside of this world but it has no value, it only matters to those who perceive it but ultimately we are equivalent to 0. because of my nihilistic views i struggle to be understood, instead people try so hard to convince me of their false optimism, i can’t connect with others because i view their optimism as being disingenuous and i do not relate to those who aren’t authentic.

i have no reason to be alive, everything feels dull, i have a low libido, i can’t connect with anyone, i don’t have anything i want to do, instead i want to watch the world descend into chaos. i want us all to crumble and break in the pressure of the world. i want us all to just perish. of course i don’t want anyone to experience pain but i want us to all have our revelation, our revelation will be the realization that the chaos we live in is all for nothing.

post_03887,"surviving adhd at 20: my journey so far 

turning 20 has made me reflect a lot on the journey i’ve had with adhd. it hasn’t always been easy, and there were times i thought i’d never get through it. but here i am—thriving, learning, and embracing who i am with adhd.

for years, it felt like my mind was always racing, bouncing from one thing to the next without a clear path. the constant struggle to stay focused, manage time, and keep up with responsibilities made me feel overwhelmed. but over time, i’ve discovered that adhd doesn’t have to define me or hold me back.

in my 20s, i’ve learned to build routines that work for me. i use tools like planners and digital reminders to stay organized. i also give myself grace when things don’t go as planned. i’ve accepted that my brain works differently, and that’s okay.

through therapy, medication, and surrounding myself with people who understand and support me, i’ve found ways to thrive. i’ve also learned to embrace the unique strengths that come with adhd, like creativity, problem-solving, and hyper-focus on things i’m passionate about.

the biggest lesson? it’s all about balance. adhd is part of who i am, but it doesn’t define me. i’m still learning and growing, and i’m proud of how far i’ve come.

if you're navigating adhd, no matter your age, know that you're not alone. it’s a journey, but survival—and success—is possible.

my sister, later that day, *did* apologize (because mom told her to) but it seemed as if she wasn't even sorry. her ""apology"" wasn't even sincere. she was laughing, looking away, rolling her eyes, as if the whole thing was a fucking joke.

my mom told the both of us that the situation between us has gotten way out of hand, and wants to do family counseling. my sister started arguing with mom, saying how she doesn't want to make up with me.

so i asked my sister, ""why are you mad at me?""

of course, she didn't answer and ignored my question. i asked over and over again, but she didn't answer it.

the next day, i told my therapist that i tried to kill myself and she told me that i had to tell my mom. i told her, and she burst into tears. i also told her about all the hurtful things my sister said to me over the years.

mom: why didn't you tell me any of this?

me: i thought you wouldn't believe me, because you and dad always knew her as a nice person.

eventually, we had to tell dad about what happened. and for the first time, he cried. i've never seen him cry before. and it broke my heart to see my parents like this.

my mom scheduled a session with my therapist on 7/29/19 *with* my sister. but i'm worried that my sister will start lying to my therapist and will try to manipulate her to make it seem like everything was my fault. but my therapist says that she is trained to not fall for that, since she knows my side of the story.

i was told that her boss was going to be there, too, because she's only involved in a session if it involves *serious* cases, such as suicide.

i obsess over things that happened years ago. and can’t let them go ever. i just cannot stop obsessing over things that probably didn’t even involve me or that nobody remembers or cares about anymore. i’m tired of thoughts that i’m a horrible person. i’m just so tired of it. it gets old to never feel comfortable with myself. the only times i do is when i’m in a group of people having fun. and i’m able to make them laugh. whenever i’m alone and that connection is gone i just panic.

at this point i’m worried that i must be high maintenance and just need a lot of attention. i just want people to like me. i literally cannot stand the thought of people hating me. and i know there’s gotta be people out there. i know and understand why people get upset at my guilty feelings and confessions. it’s just hard to stop. i feel like i need reassurance which is a short lasting fix.

post_05925,"i have pretty bad dyslexia, but for the first time as an adult i’ve read 3 full books since the beginning of august! 3 whole books! i have no one to tell, because it’s not really an achievement, but to me it feels like a big deal, the highlight of my year. no one around me really seems to care, because if we are being honest, it’s not really that big a deal, especially because i am a grown man of 31yrs old. 
but to me this has been such an invigorating achievement!
  
  
 all my life i have struggled with my reading, comprehension and learning. it’s not that i cannot read, i can, it’s just that it always feels like a huge chore, i get mixed up at times and have to re-read, and wherever possible i always avoid reading out loud, as some how i get things muddled up in my head and never read things accurately. i made my way through my school days always messing up and being teased and laughed at because of the slow pace of my reading. because of this i made a big effort to make sure that as best i could i would never allow my professional career to be effected, i wanted to insure that all my emails and work would be of the highest standard, i wouldn’t allow myself to look stupid as an adult. which for the most part i have been able to do, but a quick glance at my posts and comments will show that i am still prone to mistakes, which of course on reddit means you are totally spell and grammar checked instantly and belittled if you slip up. reading even on here mostly feels like work, it takes my brain a large amount of extra effort to accurately read anything, i get “strain” headaches and quickly tire when reading, even if it’s short titles on posts. 
 
 
so for me reading has never been my idea of fun or enjoyable, it’s always been a step towards learning or work and i’ve never gotten beyond that with my attempts at reading for pleasure. i am a big fan of military history and of medical study to do with emergency medicine or first aid, i even studied at becoming a paramedic for a short time before my study opportunity was abruptly ended. so in a way i find those subjects the easiest to begin to read in. one of the first books i’ve ever read that wasn’t because of study or school, was the diary of anne frank, it took me 2yrs to finish cover to cover, but i was 17yrs old and it was my first ever book away from school and i still felt accomplished! i found a series of books, 4 in total that were first hand fictional stories based around the real conquest of genghis khan, imagined stories about his planning and conversations etc. i took me 7yrs to complete the books, but at 26yrs i decided that recreational reading wasn’t for me. at age 29 after watching the series band of brothers for about the 50th time, i brought myself major richard “dick” winters book, recounting the events of wwii from his vantage point. it combined my love of military history with my love of the tv series, and over a 6 month period i read the book. but it still really really took so much effort. 
 
 
now with covid-19 effecting everything, and a prolonged bout of severe illness on top of my disability, combined with a less than ideal living situation and battling my chronic depression after attempted suicide earlier in the year, i found myself with a tremendous amount of time, isolated in my tiny bedroom bored out of my mind which was further whittling at my mental health. i picked up a book entitled sas: ghost patrol, which was a historic telling of the very beginnings of the sas fighting with a special unit known as the long range desert group, who specialised in crazy daring deadly raids on the nazis in northern africa during wwii, and focused on a hugely brave and bold attack on a nazi port of tobruk. i began reading, and soon i was realising that i was reading well into the early hours of the night, night after night! and just like that i had finished the book, in less than 3 weeks! i had actually thoroughly enjoyed it! then i picked up the next, and then the next and soon within a short 8+/- weeks i had completed 3 books, three entire books read and most crucially enjoyed! i am so excited and proud of myself! i just had to tell someone. i have just picked up my next booked entitled “march battalion by sven hassel”!  thank you for listening.

i'm so tired of the simple desire to help people being seen as this strange thing. i want all people in this country to have equal opportunities, access to shelter, access to food, access to good education, help for their mental health, help for their addictions, free healthcare, just overall an equal opportunity for success and happiness, as close to that as we can get. i want police and justice reform. i want environmental reform. i want a healthy happy country and planet for children to hrow up in.

i've already gone through therapy twice. the first time was a (very effective) treatment of complex ptsd and the second time was a year and a half of trying to deal with extremely low self esteem and suicidal thoughts. there has never been an attempt, but at a certain point the thoughts were there every hour of every day. the second therapy kinda worked and at the end the thoughts were brought to sporadic. so in march, i finished my treatment and stopped going to therapy (my psychologist supported this decision). now it's only ten months later and though they are not there every minute, the thoughts are definitely here everyday. but i just don't want to (and cant really afford..) to start therapy allover again. also, if it's just 10 months later and i already have to come back, it makes me feel helpless and not like i'm worth the effort and time. i'm feeling like either i'm exaggerating and i shouldnt whine and shouldnt waste all the time and energy that has already been spent on me or that treating me just doesnt really work and its lost cause.

so yeah.. this is kind of going through my head and hard to get rid of. i was wondering if any of you might have some ideas on things i could try to manage it, other than therapy?",1

post_04916,"i specifically like bbno$'s jayvik and now i'm in the jayvik fandom. i have never watched and don't want to watch arcane. (edit just to say i know my tone usually comes across pretty serious but this actually isn't a big deal, i find the situation funny and i'm not spending my whole day fretting over this. i touch grass, i swear.)

throwaway because my other acc has personal details about me i'd rather not share considering how shameful a confession i'm about to make

i knew bbno$ from his tiktok song very early on, but was a fan of smosh and he ended up on there pretty recently and also did a song that went down well in the fandom, which is where i ended up going from ""he seems chill"" to "" i'm going to follow his socials"". i like animation so really ended up liking the fan animation for two, and as a result liked two as a song, and listened to more of his stuff.

i know about jayvik from being online on twitter, just mutuals talking about it, knew of arcane. i tried to watch s1 but didn't get into it so never watched anything else. used to play league a longgg time ago lightly but couldn't remember any of the characters when i watched.

i knew will loosely from him talking about neurodiversity and i have a past with fandom things like cosplay, i know stella chuu purely down to her impressive work being shared over the years and sykkuno's cosplay.

so when all that combined and i saw all the tiktoks - despite not being into arcane, i somehow found myself hooked. every tiktok and pic that drops i find very impressive and well done for folk who have never done cosplay before. i felt alex's excitement in doing it, the buzz of the fandom that he's also in.. i guess in the same way genuine jayvik fans have; talks about going to riot, making calendars (and giving profits to la wildfire charities) and never knowing if they'll drop another insane pic or video is fun! 

as a result, my algorithms (though partially my fault by searching jayvik) my socials are packed with arcane and jayvik content and now i know chunks of the storyline.

however, i don't want to watch arcane. 
at the moment, i do struggle with watching things that have wars, in-fighting, angst, huge explosive issues stemming from misunderstandings. i wouldn't say i avoid it completely but when it goes far enough i end up feeling anxious. my therapist said it may be down to my still processing a lot of things in my past, not to mention my career is supporting and advocating for disabled people which means my life is packed with misunderstandings, ignorance and battles etc (which don't get me wrong i believe is my life's calling! and i have worked hard to separate my past and my current work.) ... and she encouraged watching in my limited spare time things that make me happy or relaxed. as a result, i am both wanting to watch it because... well... how can i be a fan if i've not watched it... but i am also not really compelled to watch arcane, but i might in future. part of me wants to ask mutuals etc if i should try to watch it, but that's ironically also admitting my situation to proper fans. i just wish i had someone i can talk it out with to see if anything might unsettle me too much, without judging me. i don't have all the details. i also have learned that it seems the writer didn't intend for this, but that it seems everyone else in production didn't get that memo.

as a result of i guess loitering in the fandom, i've gathered ideas for how these characters are from the fandom, not just shippers but the entire fandom, talking with people about the show, reading analyses and parts of wikis etc. i genuinely like who they seem to be and relate to viktor partially due to also being a cane user since a young age, who worked hard in my education etc, but often found difficulty. jayce appears patient and accepting but also invested, motivated and has conviction for what he believes in, which i also admire as personality traits. together on an objective level, they work well.

am i still okay to be a jayvik fan? should i try to watch the show?

you ordered from subway. a foot long pulled pork sub, and a 6 inch pizza sub. 2 bags of chips, and 1 cookie.

because of you, my family ate today. i was so excited, i ended my shift and drove right home. my boyfriend got half of the foot long and a bag of chips, my son got the pizza sub and half of my half of the footlong, as well as the chips and cookie. i got the remaining quarter of the foot long.

i am the sole provider and we are not doing well. i always short myself to try to get them what they need. i had to spend most of the grocery budget on bills this month just to keep the water on and keep my job. i haven't seen my son so excited in a long time, as he was to get 2 treats with his yummy sandwich.

i always feel bad when someone doesn't get their food. fortunately, the customer gets credit so they can re-order the food again free of charge. i'm sure they were annoyed at me somehow, i normally get bad reviews when someone doesn't pick up their food, despite me doing everything i can, but i wish they knew what it did for me.

edit: for anyone who wants to make rude comments about not having kids if you can't afford them.
first of all, my son was convinced while i was being help captive by the man who kidnapped me. and yes he was charged. i was 16.

we have been together for 3 years and are madly in love. she is the best thing that happend in my life.

we had a wonderfull day and we were happy and in love. almost everything went as planned.

then came the honeymoon. 

we went to the carribean and did a cruise and stayed on curaçao for a week. we visited so many places and did amazing things, but during the honeymoon, my wife kept getting bruises, that could not be explained. also a lot of headaches. we thought it was strange but nothing to worry about. 

then in the last days of the honeymoon, my wife had a blood spot in her eye and got a nosebleed that went on too long.

a doctor came and examined my wife. he could not find anything strange and told us to visit the doctor we we got back.

so 2 days later, we are back and visited the doctor. high blood pressure and he ordered blood tests.

we went in the morning to get the blood tests done and got a call from the hospital in the afternoon. 

we had to go to the hospital with haste.
after 2 hours of more tests we got the worst news.

my wife has acute leukemia.

to be precise acute promyelocytic leukemia. 
a form of leukemia that causes bleeding and clots at the same time. 

it turns this kind of leukemia is more deadly at the start  and we were very lucky. 

there is a silver lining. apl is treatable and has a high survival rate. my wife will be treated with vitamin a and arsenicum. no chemo is needed ... yeahh.

post_00403,"why live, if living means doing things due to an inner motivation, but you have no inner motivation? most people live because they have some kind of inner motivation. they want to socialize. they want to learn something. they want to do interesting hobbies. they want to have a nice career. they want to get to know new cultures. etc. etc.

but i have none of that. and i know this isn't normal. it is not normal not wanting to get out of bed every single day, since basically i am able to think. it is not normal needing external stimulation, all the time, because without it your head is just emptiness. there is no inner motor in me. no driver. no desires. i can sit, by myself, for hours, without a single productive, motivating thought coming up. the only way to evoke thoughts in my mind is through anxiety. so i make up irrational anxieties like: everyone hates me, i miss out on life if i don't do x. i need to impress other people. etc. just to get some kind of inner motivation.

but the older i get, the more i realise other people couldn't care less if you impress them, or not. on the contrary, they *want* something from you, whether it is labour, knowledge, anything useful. society is so successful because most humans have an inner motor to live each day, to learn, to collaborate.

but when you fear talking to anyone except your parents, when you do nothing, all day, unless you are being forced through anxieties, lack of money or other people, when your mind is just emptiness, you wonder why i should even live.

people live because they want to live. because they have an inner motivation. but i didn't have this thing, i didn't have it since i have been conscious. and i know this isn't normal. and when you have no inner motivation, life turns from happiness, to torture. and at some point you wonder: what am i even doing? why do i go to university to study something if i never had any interest in that topic?

the older i get, the more fear i get because my irrational fear of missing out starts to become reality. i am missing out on friendships. love. partying. i am missing out on doing things i might enjoy doing. i am missing out on what it means to live.

when you have no inner motivation, and no one else needs you, you wonder why you are even here. my parents live, and they motivate me. i fear the day they are gone, because then the day will come where the only people to care about me will be gone. after that my current suffering will turn from horrible to unbearable, when i will have to fight through this world, without any motivation.

friendships don't work without motivation, if you never invite someone over because you have nothing to talk about, do, anything. hobbies don't work because other people see, feel, you only do those hobbies to distract yourself, you don't actually enjoy them. jobs don't work because your coworkers, boss realize you have no life, and work is the only thing giving you temporary purpose.

all because my mind has no motivation. why? just why? why am i like this? why do i have to make up motivation in my mind just to exist?",0
post_05082,"i tried to end my life and woke up—twice. i don't know how and here's what happened. on january 20th, 2025, after a rough day and months of feeling like i’d lost everything, i decided i’d had enough. i got into my car with what i thought was the “perfect recipe” to go peacefully. i drove to a quiet, meaningful spot in the city—an empty, dimly lit street—around 12:30 am. i parked, sat there for a while, and even wrote a note apologizing to whoever might find me later.

around 1:30 am, i decided it was time. i took 10 mg of rivotril (clonazepam) to numb my body, hoping for a quiet passing. after that, i smoked two pre-rolled joints, thinking they’d make me drowsy. by 2:00 am, i felt the weed kicking in, so i started drinking shots from a 70cl bottle of jack daniels, believing the mix of alcohol and clonazepam would do the job. about 4–5 shots in, i felt weightless, my hands and feet went cold, and i thought, *this is it.* i said my goodbyes in my head and closed my eyes.

but instead of never waking up, i opened my eyes at 10:00 am to the sound of cars driving by. i saw a random guy carrying groceries and realized he hadn’t noticed me. i still couldn’t feel much or move properly, but i had another 10 mg of clonazepam with me, so i took it with some gatorade i found in the backseat, thinking this time i wouldn’t wake up.

somehow, i woke up again at 4:00 pm to the sound of the same guy starting his car. i sat up, confused, still feeling like i was dreaming. i even reversed my car down the street for no reason, just acting on autopilot. i stared at the empty pill jar next to me and felt completely numb. in that haze, i made the poor decision to reach out to an ex, hoping she’d understand. she didn’t—she just told me not to contact her. that hit hard, but i didn’t have the energy to process it.

after sitting in my car in silence for 30 minutes, i slowly drove home. i don’t even remember what someone said to me when i walked in. i just crawled into bed and slept for 16 hours. when i woke up, i whispered, *fuck,* partly amazed i was alive and partly frustrated. life quickly pulled me back in—work, friends, and random distractions like video games, late-night drives, and walks.

looking back now, i’m glad i woke up. that moment was a low spell, not my end. i still feel empty inside, but i’ve promised myself i’ll never try to end things again. i’m seeking professional help, leaning on loved ones, and taking life one day at a time.

i just wanted to share this unfiltered story with the void. writing it all out feels oddly comforting, and i hope anyone reading this knows they’re not alone. better days will come. i’m working on believing that, too.



tldr: i tried to end my life by mixing clonazepam, alcohol, and weed in my car late at night, thinking it would lead to a peaceful passing. despite taking multiple doses and feeling completely numb, i woke up twice—first at 10 am, then again at 4 pm. after failing to find comfort by reaching out to an ex, i drove home and slept for 16 hours. now, i’m reflecting on how i survived, seeking professional help, and holding onto hope that things will get better. writing this is part of my journey to heal.",1

post_06380,"gf’s 7yr old son has brain cancer, and i’m angry that we could’ve stop it sooner. her son was diagnosed tuesday with a mass the size of a ping pong ball in his head. she has been fighting with her exh for months to get their son looked at properly and treated. finally, she got a neurologist to look at footage of him walking around and was very concerned, wanted to schedule an mri and see him immediately. that was 2 weeks ago. last week they went in and got the results, and it was a whirlwind flight to the children’s hospital and surgery the very next day.

i am extremely grateful for all the doctors and staff, and for my gf for never giving up, she knew there was something wrong, but didn’t know what. we all saw how he was, the headaches, vomiting, lack of sleep, the circles under his eyes, and how he had lost so much weight. he has been sick and fighting this alone for so long, having no one but his mom believing he was sick.

this is where i’m angry; his dad has thought that his boy was fine this whole time. he has denied that there was anything wrong with his son. he has fought against his exw (my gf) every single step of the way. he said that it was her house and care that was making him sick, he even went so far as to start telling doctors, child therapists, and family counselors that she was mentally ill and she was making him (the child) sick. he’s a very convincing narcissist, and i want to throw him out of the window. he has gaslighted all of them so much that my gf was hating herself, he has manipulated the children (they have a daughter together too,) into thinking that the only way they would be safe was in his care.

her family and i have been advocating for her this whole time, reassuring her that no, it’s not her fault, her son is in fact unwell, and she needs to explore every avenue to find a solution. 10months later, we find out she was right all along. what a shit thing to be right about, how could you be happy for cancer? but it  proves that this man is evil incarnate. he doesn’t deserve to have children.

my psychologist recommended i ask my doctor/psychiatrist to give ms some ativan/lorazepam to use only whenever someone has to come inside my apartment.

post_06099,"i’ve been lying to my family for 25 years. i guess it’s time for me to come clean. not because i feel too bad for what i’ve been doing, but because it’s possible my eldest son is on to me.

i have 3 kids and a wonderful wife. for more than 25 years our family has loved doing puzzles together. since we started, i’ve done something that may seem unsavory to people that don’t understand the joy of putting in that final piece. to ensure it was always me, whenever we start a new puzzle i take one of the pieces and hide it in a green sock that’s  at the bottom of my dresser. whenever we get to the very end, we all, once again, lost a piece. we all search frantically until i’m the hero who finds it. 

well, this past sunday we got to completion once again, only this time there are two pieces missing. we begin searching. it may be my imagination but my eldest son gave me a look. it was a half smirk. i think he’s on to me.

derek, if you’re reading this, i have more patience than you do. i’ll hold my piece forever if i need to. “find” yours first, and let’s end this madness…

edit-1::

a fellow reddit user pmd me an incredible idea. i’m going to try and contact the manufacturer and order his missing piece. i’m going to “find” it when it arrives, then “find” mine immediately after. i almost feel bad when i consider how truly confused he will be. thank you spockhighonspores!

i don’t think he’s found this thread yet because he hasn’t approached me about it, so this could still work. i’m so excited! this will go down in family history. 

checkmate

edit-2::

well folks, i’ve been duped. i got up this morning, went into the kitchen to get some coffee and as i walked past the puzzle i noticed that it had been completed. all pieces accounted for. i calmly, and politely knocked on derek’s door and asked him about it. he denied knowing anything about it. like, super convincing. i went down back down to my bedroom, confused as ever and just sat in bed with a blank stare. my wife asked me what’s wrong, and i told her that the puzzle was completed and i have no idea how it got done.

she literally started laughing like a damn hyena… “ive always known about your dumb green sock” i’m in shock. i’m numb. like a damn gut punch. so as it turns out, she’s known what i’ve been doing for at least 10 years. she said she loved watching me walk around thinking i was some criminal mastermind tricking everyone, and that’s why she never said anything. she wanted me to have my win, while she secretly laughed and had her own fun in secret.

i don’t even know what to say. i’m just processing everything. i cannot believe she’s had this over me for so long and i literally had no idea. she noticed a decade ago that i had just 1 green sock, since i lost its pair forever ago, and immediately knew something was up with it since i refused to throw it away. i guess that makes sense. i’m an idiot.

i’ve come to the realization that she’s actually the master here, it’s her house, and i should be thankful she lets me live in it.

at least she promised not to tell the kids.",0

post_03709,"i dared to be great, but now i’m in square one again… i am 29 years old (m), married, with 2 beautiful and healthy children.

approximately 10 years ago, december 2014, i experienced my first panic attack during a chemistry exam in college. after that i had overwhelming panic attacks, anxiety, fear, insomnia, constant worries, hopelessness, and sadness. a couple of years later, most of my symptoms disappeared, with what i thought was due to the knowledge i gained from therapy. 

unfortunately, i experienced another panic attack in july 2018, on my wedding day, and began to experience all the same symptoms all over again. anxiety, fear, constant worries, insomnia, hopelessness, and sadness. this time i noticed that with the anxiety came a lot of irrational fears and thoughts; fears that usually didn't worry me, but in this mental state became so dire and fearful. 

i began to have intrusive thoughts like: ""do i really love my wife? how do i know for certain? maybe i made a mistake?"" 

i began to notice that although the thoughts were ridiculous, they triggered a strong emotion of fear in me, for reasons i did not understand. again, a year or so passed, and my symptoms and irrational thoughts went away, and i began to feel like my old self. 

throughout this time, i worked in a dental office as a dental assistant and got promoted as a dental manager. i really enjoyed my job and always dreamed of pursuing a career in dentistry. unfortunately due to my history with anxiety i became very insecure in myself and my capabilities. i felt like i couldn't pursue a career in dentistry if i constantly fell into the same cycle of anxiety and panic attacks every few years. 

for this reason, i kept on postponing my education and the dental entrance exam- a 5 hour exam that i was terrified of taking because i was scared it would trigger another panic attack and all of my symptoms again. 

i continued to work as a manager and prayed that one day i would have an opportunity to open a dental office with another dentist. instead of facing my fears and taking the dental entrance exam and consequently going to dental school. 

during this time, my wife finished school, and we got pregnant with my first son. this news inspired me to face and overcome my fears, so i began to study for the dental entrance exam. 
i continued to work part time and study for the dental entrance exam. 

in june of 2021, 6 months after i started to study, my anxiety returned, again i began to have the same symptoms as before, but this time i was worried because my wife and i were bringing a child into this world, and i felt like i needed to get myself together for my son. approximately 6 months later i felt better, and i believe the birth of my son had a lot to do with my speedy recovery this time around. 

during this time i stopped studying because i noticed that everytime i began to study my symptoms would return. i continued to work in the dental office as a manager, making a very good income. unfortunately, although i was making a good living, i did not feel fulfilled. i felt like i was not striving to reach my ultimate potential. yet again, i decided i was going to become a dentist. 

i took the exam in may of 2023, scored very well and got accepted to new york university of dentistry. at this point i thought that i faced my biggest fear and came out triumphant, and wanted to believe that all of my troubles with anxieties and fears were in my past.. 

i began dental school in july of 2024. the first summer semester was 6 weeks. during that 6 week time frame we had 11 exams. it was very overwhelming and stressful, but i managed to do very well. some days i felt very anxious, but i told myself it was expected considering the stress i was going through. i pushed through, and was able to complete the first semester. following this semester, i became even more confident in myself and my abilities.

then the next semester started and i started off very well. but after every exam, i would come home, take a nap, and wake up in a panic. i would wake up with emotions of fear. fear that was very familiar to me from my previous episodes of anxiety and panic. i began to confide in my wife, telling her that i am scared to fail, although my grades said otherwise. 

i was scared to fail not because i feared that i was intellectually incapable. instead i feared that i would fail because my symptoms of anxiety would return like they did so many times in the past. this then turned into a vicious cycle. the more stressed i got due to my studies, the more symptoms and irrational fears/thoughts i began to experience. the more symptoms of anxiety i experienced, the more i worried i would fail at pursuing my life long dream of becoming a dentist. 

things got so bad that i barely slept. but i kept on pushing through. the more i pushed, the more frequent my panic attacks became. i couldn't even sit in class without experiencing severe anxiety, muscle tensions, headaches, dizziness, palpitations, chest pains.
i began to feel depressed. i didn't want to accept that my biggest fear has possibly turned into a reality- that because of my anxiety and symptoms, i won't be able to finish school and become a dentist. 

i began to confide in my family, my mother, my wife, my uncle in desperate need of help and advice. they just kept on telling me i need to relax, and not take school so seriously. that i was doing it all to myself and that it was all in my head. this just made things worse, because i felt that my worries and concerns were justified because my symptoms returned again and they interfered with my ability to continue. at this point i was emotionally, physically, and mentally drained. 

somehow, i completed the fall semester, passed all the courses, and started my 3 week winter break. during the break i tried my best to relax and my symptoms lessened but persisted. the more the symptoms persisted, the more i worried that the next semester would be a reflection of the last. my break ended and i began the next semester in january 2025. 

i was hopeful that something would change. i prayed to god every single day. but the symptoms  returned and i began to feel hopeless and depressed. i began to have breakdowns every night once i got home from. i understood that i couldn't continue like this any longer, and that i would have to leave school. that hurt me so much. i worked so hard to get to where i am today, and i have to give it all up because of the way i was feeling. the saddest part was the fact that yet again, i didn't understand what triggered me to feel this way. the overwhelming panic attacks, anxiety, fear, insomnia, constant worries, hopelessness, and sadness.

i would feel better if i was intellectually incapable and failed courses which led to my dismissal from the dental program. this way at least i would know that i was incapable and came to peace with it and moved on. but right now, i feel like i was not given a fair chance. 

thankfully, i was able to take a medical leave of absence from dental school. i was given permission to return next january 2026 with no financial or educational penalties. thank god for this opportunity. 

but i am still afflicted with the same anxieties and worries. i am in a deep depression, because i worked so hard to get to this point and i feel like my entire life's work was ripped from right under me. i feel as though every time i begin to gain momentum working towards my dreams, i hit a brick wall. i worry that i will never be able to overcome my anxiety and panic and as a result never be able to become a dentist and live a fulfilled and content life.

to help with my current symptoms, i am taking antidepressants (lexapro) for the 17th day. 

i write this post in desperate hopes that someone has been through something similar and will help me identify exactly what causes me to fall into the same cycle over and over again. so that i can return to dental school this upcoming january 2026 with peace and tranquility in my soul and mind and finish the remaining 3.5 years of dental program.

i don’t like having thoughts of self harm or thinking of my husband finding my corpse one day.
i don’t like thinking about what would be the cleanest most painless way of going.
i don’t like trying to justify my thought processes. and trying to convince myself everything would be better if i was gone.
i don’t like thinking what would happen if i had a failed attempt and then what life would be like after that.
i don’t like myself and i’m so tired.

i don’t know if anyone has any advice to help with these thoughts, but i’d like some if so.

i didn't want any of that. i wanted to help people. i wanted to write some good stories. but i'll never be seen as more than just some future thug who's always itchin' for some violent action. i'll never be able to help people when all they do is pretend i'm in the background, or make some disgusted face towards my disturbing visage. 

i'll never get married. i'll never have real friends other than people that just stand me. i'll never have a real life, the one that you dream about. i'll probably end up with a bullet in my brain, or as one of those homeless drunkards you see around. not the ones peddling for cash. the ones that stare out whenever you look at them, and you realize wholeheartedly that their souls have died.

post_05185,"18, gambling addict, suicidal, drowning in debt i’m 18, from the uk, have been a gambling addict since last summer, put myself in significant debt because of my gambling addiction and am at my breaking point. 

what started as a fun hobby, just a couple sports bets here and there had now turned into a full blown gambling addiction.

last summer i had lost my life savings of around £5000, this was money i had earned and saved from working a weekend job during school and from my online business. at the time i had relatively decent credit from using a credit builder credit card from when i turned 18 earlier on in 2024, this is when i realised that i now had access to borrow a substantial amount of funds in the form of other credit cards and overdrafts. 

once i found out about online crypto casinos and how easily i could gamble whenever and wherever, i started dipping into debt to feed my addiction. by around october of 2024 i had amassed around £2000 in credit card debt, £1500 in overdrafts and £2500 in external financing. 

i hadn’t had a job since the end of 2023 and only had income coming in from odd jobs, my online business, etc. hence why i regretfully decided to borrow money to gamble. luckily i landed a job towards the end of 2024 and have been paying off my debts each month. i only make just over £1000 a month from this full time job though which isn’t much and means i’ve had to pay back my debts bit by bit.

i now have around £850 in credit card debt and around £250 in other personal debts remaining, with my overdrafts and financing fully paid off. i’ve been fighting this addiction for what feels like forever now but have still gone back to gambling multiple times despite losing everything every time, knowing that i will probably lose everything every time.

yesterday i received a spontaneous refund of around £1500 from a company i used to buy crypto to gamble, this was money i had lost gambling but i was accidentally refunded the money back. i decided to use this £1500 to gamble and try to recoup some of my losses (approx £10,000-£15,000 all time). i luckily turned the £1500 into £3000 and now had an extra £1500 on top of setting aside the original £1500 just incase they attempt to take the money back as this was again, definitely an accidental refund. 

but as per usual it wasn’t enough for me, i then went on to lose the £1500 profit i had made, only to chase that loss with the £1500 i set aside and then lost that too. 

i now have the possibility of the company/bank potentially trying to take the money back (which i do not have), only adding to my debt. 

i’ve come close to ending it before but i’m at my breaking point. i can’t break this addiction and the cycle it comes with, losing it all, hating myself, sleepless days, everything. 

i’m now in £2600 of debt if they do take the money back and can’t do this anymore. ",1

post_03334,"has anyone switched to a new med after a long time on another one? i’ve been on zoloft for about 8 years. after my second baby was born 9 months ago i ended up with severe postpartum anxiety and depression and the psychiatrist had me up my dose to the maximum (200mg). i’m a lot better than i was but nowhere near where i’d like to be. granted, i’m severely sleep deprived as my baby isn’t a great sleeper and i also have a 4 year old.

i’m curious has anyone changed from zoloft to another med? or just switched meds in general? was it worth it? did you have many side effects during the switch? i’m eyeing prozac as i’ve heard it can be good for ocd and a lot of my anxiety comes from obsessive thoughts (death, illness, existential issues, etc.)

post_05452,"the opportunity of a k-drama main character is given to me and i wish it wasn't 

hey redditors. i really don't know what to do and have no one to say this to. 

i live in a economically not-so-ok country. i'm in uni and i have a bf of almost 2 months. my family doesn't know about him since it's still too early. i love him dearly but it's still hard to know him truly as it's not been even 2 months yet. 

my dad works at a factory and he is very cloce with his boss. his boss has a son same age as me (i'm a girl). you probably know where this is going.

today i was sitting watching tv with my mom and grandma. i was looking at my phone whilst listening to my mom and grandma's convo. my mom said smt like ""i said to him (my dad) why not make her (me) meet with his son?"" and i didn't say anything. later today, my dad came from work and started talking about him. he didn't say it directly to me but i knew what was happening.

now, as i said, i love my bf but i also know not to be blinded by it. i don't think i can leave him but i also don't know if i know him well. also there is a possibility that the boss's son will not be interested in me. i know he is not a bad person as i've heard about him from my dad for years (from when i was a little child). 

what do i do? will i be regretful? what would you do? 

since it's still my first year in uni, i will obviously not be married for at least 3 years (until i graduate) and i don't plan on marrying right after uni as well. 

i have 3 years ahead of me but i know my mom will not give up on this idea. this sounds so fake but it isn't 😭 i'm scared of my mom's reaction if i say i have a bf. please help 🙏🏻😭",1

i broke up with him in january which took a lot of determination, and he threw everything i owned on the front lawn. at the lowest point in my life, sleeping on a friend’s couch, i decided to do something crazy. i got on zillow and looked at places for sale in my hometown. i found a historic farmhouse that needs a lot of restoring for an insanely cheap price, with a lot land. 

now i’m home, i can breathe, and i can literally do anything to *my* house that i want to. i bought classy, yet fun tile for my bathroom that has flowers all over it. i painted my bedroom purple. i’m doing a decidedly 70’s theme in my kitchen and i just put stick on vinyl all over my fridge with huge sunflowers on it. like, i’m going wild. 

i can leave my house at any time and come and go as i please. i can go to walmart at 2am on a saturday for ben and jerry’s if i have a random craving, and no one is going to scream at me and threaten me for it. it may sound stupid to some, but it just made me break down in happy tears after bouncing all around my living room to classic rock.

post_06028,"i found messages that my boyfriend sent his ex the other night. they were so sweet they made me want to cry. my boyfriend was previously married in his twenties. he never talks about her much, just that it was something that happened in his life and he doesn't think of her much anymore. he's never said anything bad about her, but he has indicated that she had some mental health issues that lead to the decline of their marriage. 

all in all, i figured her loss was my gain, as my boyfriend is the sweetest, kindest partner i have ever had. 

today he is at work, but told me i could go into his place to hang out before he got off. i got on his laptop to watch some netflix, and found it open to facebook (yeah, he lives in the past a bit). 

there was a chat box open with a woman's name. it took me a minute, but i eventually recognized it was his ex-wife. 

my heckles were up, i'll admit. for a horrible few seconds i thought my whole happy relationship was about to crumble. but then i read them.

she messaged first. she seemed frantic, maybe in the midst of a mental health crisis. she told him she desperately wanted him back, and claimed he is the only man who ever treated her with kindness. she was practically begging.

and my boyfriend responded to her that he is in a happy relationship and he will not respond to any contact like that again (and i let out i sigh of relief).

but he went on to tell her that, while they will never be able to be friends, he did believe she is a good person. but her mental health issues make it impossible for her to form a stable and healthy relationship with others. he told her he hopes she can find therapy that works for her. 

he told her that he never wants to know her again, but he does hope that she can eventually have a stable and happy life. but that it won't happen until she confronts her troubles. 

he ended by reiterating that he is in a relationship with someone he loves very much, and that he won't ever respond to communication from her again. but he did wish her well.

he worded it a lot more eloquently than i am able to. but i was in tears at the bittersweet feeling. it reminds me of all the reasons i love him.

and if i were to ever speak to his ex, i would tell her that i am truly sorry for what she has to deal with. part of me wanted to be angry that she would send a message to my boyfriend like that, but i really only feel sympathy. i'm sorry you are hurting and i am sorry for how it is affecting your life. i'm sorry it made you miss out on the wonderful relationship i have now.

 we started texting consistently to find out we had the same music taste, hobbies, he drew me, we just talked. we shared a lot of the same interests. 

 he finally asked me on a date thursday night but he drove a motorcycle and it was raining and i asked to reschedule. he wanted to take me to a nice fancy restaurant for our first date. he said i was beautiful, sweet and worth it. i was so excited. so we rescheduled for the next day. 

around 5 he asked me if he could bring me dinner and i was grocery shopping and i said i’d let him know. at 5:19 he said i was worth it.

so after years of childhood trauma, anxiety and depression i finally got to a stage where i could afford decent therapy and had my first session today. my therapist seems really nice and her little room was the perfect environment for me to feel comfortable talking.

at the end she asked me what i wanted from therapy. as i was telling her all about me and my life, i was constantly worried about her thinking i was overreacting, judging my stories or thinking them not serious enough to require therapy and that i was just a weak person. she looked at my blankly and said ‘is it a big deal for you?’ i said, ‘yes, massively’ and she just simply replied ‘well then it’s a big deal...’, and just shrugged her shoulders and started talking about our next session.

honestly it was like an epiphany. i realised that if something is a big deal in my universe, then it is a big deal because it’s me that matters and someone else not thinking it’s serious does not invalidate that. i’m always so anxious that my problems will seem silly to someone else, but actually if they really care about helping you get through it, they won’t judge the nature of the problem but try and help you through it anyway because they know it’s a serious problem to you. your problems are all valid and they’re all worth fixing guys, don’t ever forget that xx",0

post_06315,"for almost the past year, my adopted daughter has called me by just my name ever since i took her in. she called me dad for the first time ever yesterday so yesterday was also my actual birthday. she of course told me happy birthday that morning, which immediately made the day better. but after dinner last night, she said ""can i tell you something?"", to which i said ""of course"". and she went on to tell me about her actual dad, who had been in and out of her life from the beginning, and who she had to watch walk out on her and her mom when he voluntarily gave up his parental rights in court. she never saw or heard from him again. she'd told me that story before but then added something i didn't know: our birthdays are only two days apart. i noticed she was rather reclusive this past week but didn't push her on telling me what was wrong.

when she got finished telling me this, i asked if she missed him or anything like that and she gave perhaps her coldest response ever. ""no, i don't even think about him"". now i've explained to her in the past the difference between me being her ""dad"" and her father, and she understood and just called me by my name. i guess it made her feel safe knowing there was a distinction between me and him. she actually didn't get upset this time though and just said ""you're the only dad who’s ever cared about me”.

i smiled but also could tell how brokenhearted she sounded saying it, so i brought her in for a hug. “i’ll always be your dad, and i’m never gonna walk away” i said. that was when she finally started crying properly and i eventually calmed her down. we each said we love each other and her tears turned to happy crying and she even kissed me on my cheek. when she went to bed later, i checked in on her to make sure she was okay and she said “goodnight dad”. i fell asleep nearly crying.",0

post_05059,"the truth she refused to face # i've been carrying something heavy, and it's time i acknowledge it.

💔 **this past year, i reconnected with someone who had once meant the world to me**—someone i thought i had lost forever. it felt like fate, like a second chance to make things right, to heal, to grow, to rebuild something meaningful from the wreckage we left behind years ago.

and for a while, it felt like we were doing just that. **we held each other through difficult conversations, through nights of deep reflection and vulnerability, through laughter that reminded us of who we used to be before life tore us apart.** i believed, truly, that we were on a path toward something real.

but the truth is, **love alone isn’t always enough.**

🚨 **boundaries started being crossed.** the lines between love & control, care & coercion, safety & danger blurred in ways i never imagined. i was grabbed, pushed, overpowered, and physically forced into situations i wasn’t comfortable with. 😞 when i tried to set boundaries, they were ignored. when i tried to offer help, it was met with deception. when i reached my breaking point, i was made to feel like i was the problem.

for a long time, i felt like i owed people my **presence, my patience, even my suffering**—because of the hurt i once caused in my past. **i thought that by staying, by enduring, by giving all of myself, i could somehow right the wrongs of the past.**

⚠️ but **love is not a debt to be repaid.**  
⚠️ **pain does not equal redemption.**

# and yet, i stayed.

i stayed because **i thought i owed it to her.**  
because years ago, when i was broken and lost, **i hurt her.**  
i made mistakes i will always regret. i lost control of myself and caused pain that i can never take back.

so when **she started hurting me, i told myself, “maybe i deserve this.”**  
i convinced myself that enduring this was a form of accountability.  
that if i took enough pain, if i absorbed enough of her chaos, if i let her take out her suffering on me, then maybe i could finally **right my past wrongs.**

💡 **but the thing about guilt is that it tricks you into thinking you have to suffer to heal.**  
💡 **and that’s not the truth.**

because the truth is: **i have changed.**  
✅ i have worked relentlessly to become a better person.  
✅ i have built a life for myself that is stable, meaningful, and full of purpose.  
✅ i have taken responsibility for my past, and i have done everything in my power to be someone worthy of love—**real love.**

and that means **i can’t keep punishing myself for who i used to be.**

# her and i had known each other for almost 10 years.

we were together once before, when we were younger, **when life was messier but full of potential and inspiration.** but we were both struggling with our own demons. and after all this time, after so many years apart, i thought we had a chance to rebuild, to make something good from the pain.

for months, **i gave my time, my energy, my patience, my love.** 💔  
every weekend, every day off, every spare moment, **i chose to be there.**  
i spent time with her family, helped her in every way i could, and poured myself into this connection, believing in the possibility of healing.

but **i now see what i ignored for so long:**

💔 **men experience coercion too.**  
💔 **men can be manipulated too.**  
💔 **men can be victims too.**

and just because it doesn’t fit the **typical narrative,** doesn’t mean it didn’t happen.

# to anyone struggling to see their worth after someone has violated their trust:

❌ you are **not weak** for being caught in it.  
❌ you are **not responsible** for their choices.  
❌ you are **not obligated** to stay and endure more.

for a while, **i told myself i deserved it.** that i was just making up for my own past mistakes. that this was balance. that this was **“what i owed.”**  
but i see now how **twisted that logic is.**

🚫 **i don’t have to suffer to prove i’ve changed.**  
🚫 **i don’t have to endure abuse to be worthy of forgiveness.**  
🚫 **i don’t have to stay where i am not respected—no one does.**

for anyone who needs to hear this:  
👉 **you are not obligated to keep someone in your life just because you once wronged them.**  
👉 **your growth, your healing, your redemption—it doesn’t come from self-sacrifice.**  
👉 **it comes from making better choices, setting better boundaries, and choosing yourself when you need to.**

# so today, i’m letting go.

not of her, but of the belief that **i am still the person who made those mistakes.**

🕊️ **i am not defined by my past.**  
🕊️ **i do not have to stay in something painful just because i once caused pain.**

❤️‍🩹 **i forgive her for the ways she’s hurt me.**  
❤️‍🩹 **i forgive myself for the ways i’ve hurt her.**

💬 **this is me choosing myself.**  
💬 **this is me walking away from what doesn’t serve me.**  
💬 **this is me reclaiming my voice.**

i will always have love for the person she once was. i will always be grateful for the lessons. but **i will no longer let my past dictate what i accept in the present.**

✅ **i forgive myself for who i was.**  
✅ **i release myself from the guilt.**  
✅ **and i am finally walking away from what no longer serves me.**

because **love should never feel like a cage.** 🪽",0

**updated on 8/1/19**

i think i'll use my cake day to update this post.   i can not say thank you enough to the reddit community!!  for years & years i lurked on reddit. i read almost every single day, but i didn't participate much.  i had an old account for several years before i started this new one (which was supposed to be a throwaway account to ask a tricky financial question but i like the name.) as much as i enjoyed reddit i did not understand the spirt of ""the community"" until this post.  i could feel you all when i could not feel much else.  it was eye-opening and amazing and i will forever be grateful to each one of you.

i had more than 200 comments and about as many private messages.  it feels like those messages literally gave me life in the very beginning. i was careful to only read a few dozen a day, trying hard to make the comfort last as long as i possibly could.  i don't have words to say how much comfort i have received from reddit after this post.  i genuinely hope you never understand the depth of my gratitude because that would require you to understand the depth of my misery.  reddit to me was truly miraculous.  and because of you, i was going good!!  like really good!  everyone kept saying it was shock but i knew it was all the love, prayers, support and good thoughts that had come from this post that was keeping me afloat.  i am still positive that is the fact of the matter!

i was rocking widowhood until around week five, then it hit me like a freight train out of control. i completely lost my everlovn' mind.  i stayed slightly insane and more than slightly drunk until my doctor prescribed me an antidepressant about 10 days ago.  im starting to feel sorta human again.  well, human may be an overstatement but i don't feel like i'm completely insane anymore (although subject to change without prior notification.)  


when i finally gave in and went to my doctor it was because i literally thought that i had developed early-onset dementia. for real.  i was so worried about it for two weeks straight.  i just kept thinking omg this can't be happening!  our three (adult) daughters just lost their father and now they're gonna lose their mother to a memory care award or an insane asylum.  as it turns out (fyi tuck this away for the future just in case you might need this information,) but apparently if you only sleep for 2 to 3 hours a night for several weeks straight, you start to lose your cognitive skills.  i had no idea.  i genuinely thought i had gone insane.  

but back to you guys, i'm positive that without this post i could not of gotten through his memorial service.  i tried to write the eulogy for two weeks! i bet i started 60 times!  then the very night before the service (6/29) at like 2am i remember what i had written here.  i took the post, reworded a thing or two and added a bit more and voilà i rocked the eulogy.   

i made it through the whole service without shedding a single tear.  since it was going to be the first time i've met some of our employees in person i did not want to embarrass him by having smudged & streaked makeup  (not that dead people necessarily get embarrassed but you get the jest of what i'm saying.)  i think i would have made him proud. 


i can't believe i'm still standing to be honest.  but i've actually managed to work two whole days in a row!  like full days!  although our company has continued to pay my salary, i've honestly been too out of it to do much. luckily our two partners seem to be understanding.  

i am soooo looking forward to the day we are not every single thing reminds me of him!  tonight a quick trip to walgreens had me near tears because i saw candy corn on the shelf, it was the only candy he would ever eat and only around halloween.!  🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️

anyway, i just want to say thank you all so much from the bottom of my heart!!  you'll never know how truly grateful i am!

                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


my husband died a few hours ago.  

around 5 p.m. on june 14th he went into the bathroom, locked the door and then collapsed.  i heard him fall.  i tried for a few seconds to get the door open but i couldn't.  i called 911 and they got here pretty quickly.   one of the paramedics kick the door in but it was too late.

we both have had some type of bug and had not been feeling well for the last few days.  he had taken some cold medicine so i'm assuming he had a heart attack.  i just don't know for sure.  he was only 57.

it seems strange that his passing would not be a big deal worldwide, like how is cnn talking about politics and not jeff?  the world has lost a truly great man.   a very rare man.  can't you all feel it?  the whole wide world is darker.  jeff was a good, kind, honorable man.  honest to god, he was the smartest man i've ever met.  he was was so sweet and tender-hearted. he loved me like no man has ever loved a women.  he was faithful and funny!! oh my goodness no one could make me laugh like he did.  he was the most quick-witted person ever.  he was a wonderful father, friend, cat daddy...even though he said he hated cats and was super mad every time i added one to the family, only to have him being the head snuggler in a few days.  i went through his phone and he had more pictures of our kitties than he did of even our grand babies. 

several years ago, him and his best friend started a company.  this left him interacting with the often ""chronically"" unemployed as well as heads of government. i always marveled he showed absolutely no difference in his interactions.  the homeless man applying for work was treated exactly the same as the mayor.  no airs, no pretension.  the moment he shook your hand, you were counted as a friend.  just honest simple kindness. 

he had a comfortable friendliness about him that instantly put people at ease. her also had an unexplainable air of authority about him.  people naturally just fell in line behind him.  he was a born leader.  people did what he told them to do, usually without question.  one story that always comes to m mind when i think about his seemingly otherworldly authority that left others comfortable and confident knowing he was in charge and he would handle it.  

recently we had a story in our local news about a child who lost a leg in an accident.   jeff donated the money to provide a prosthetic, on the one condition; you can't tell anyone where the money came from.  we are far from being wealthy.  in fact as little as 5 years ago we were nearly completely bankrupt after he endured a very long medical illness.  every single cent we had was gone.  all of our savings and retirement.  
during his illness his company took the first opportunity to let him go. he was sick and there we were without a dime or insurance.  
  
he got better then set out to open his own company so that he could make sure this particular job and community need was met.  he wanted to provide  the service with integrity.  he did.  by the second year in business he made more money than in the five years combined.  he was a work horse! he gave 200% to every single project and worked sometimes 18-19 hour days. he did it cheerfully because he knew he could help people.  he was such a blessing to everyone who met him. 

i'm a mess.  i'm so afraid and confused.  i don't know how to handle any of this.  he handled everything.  i had a rough childhood, early on it was if his mission in life was to make me happy. he spoiled me, not just with things but with himself.  in all of these years i can't think of a single moment in time that he did not put me first.  

i tried to always had to keep tabs on  him before i called him because i knew that if he was in a meeting or in the middle of a big presentation, it didn't matter if it was with the governor and mayor of the or any combination of bigwigs, if my number popped up on his caller id he would stop the meeting and take my call.   it was so sweet but it was also embarrassing to know you stopped and important presentation just to ask something as simple ""what would you like for dinner?"" i had asked him over and over again to just let my calls go to voice mail if he wasn't alone, even promising that if there ever was an actual emergency i would text him 911 first.  he still answered my call. it always made me feel not just loved but adored.

i called his closest friends to let them know.  i have literally heard more grown men openly weeping in the last day than i ever have in whole life combined.  i'm so afraid of a future without him.  he was my everything.  my whole life has been playing a supporting role to his ambitions.  i don't have any idea how to deal with the finances,  what to do about the brand new truck he bought six months ago.  i don't know what to do about anything and i'm so afraid i can't live without him. but mostly im afraid that i don't want to live without him.",1
post_06295,"i hate being black. ever since i moved to the u.s. i've hated being black. who knew a country could make you hate yourself so much.

in my home country in africa i knew that bad people do bad things, it has nothing to do with their skin color or tribe. but now everytime i watch the news and it's about a robbery i expect a black person.

the snide comments from other races also add up. today at school i was in the cafeteria talking to my friends about last night's assignment and a person that i have never met nor seen in my life said ""why are black people such monkeys, so disgusting"". i mean, why would anyone say that. black people are people we have feelings too. and i couldn't even confront them because that would paint me as the angry black woman.

my mother had a talk with me and my brother about cops. she said that if a cop ever stops us, to speak in an african accent, in order to ease their worry.

just recently my brother was hanging out with four of our cousins and a neighbor called the police because she saw a gang scouting the neighborhood. i mean come on, a gang, these kids are 13. 

my brother recently got suspended because he asked a girl if she liked her hotdogs with ketchup or mustard. why are the teachers sexualizing a young boy? because he looks older than his peers or what?

i hate the backhanded compliments: ""you're pretty for a black girl"", ""you're smart for a black girl"". ""oh, you're from africa, that explains why you're not like other black people"". i hate that people think they can confide in me about hating african americans just because i'm african. i don't want to hear how you think they are pathetic, worthless, leeches of society, disgusting, they smell weird, they act like monkeys or they are monkeys, how they are not as evolved as other races. just stop.i am one of them.

come on, stop.

my grandfather was killed fighting (mau mau) off the british. only to go to history class to hear that white people were the best thing to happen to black people from my classmates. that shit huuurts.

i hate that in order for people to respect me, i have to be better than them. or when my family and i go to an ""expensive"" store we get ignored.",0

it hurts. i know he's probably hurting more. he wanted to talk things through and fix it but there's no ""fixing"" anything without one of us compromising our entire lives for the other. we also have an age gap. 

i'm older, and know where i belong and what i'm doing with my life. he doesn't. he's figuring it out and changing plans on the fly. i can't do that with him.

then there's my ptsd and how badly, and regularly, he triggers me just by existing. i reject him a lot. i can see how it hurts him. he tries so hard to make sure i feel safe and loved. i can't keep doing this to either of us.

i just want him to be free to go on whatever adventure he wants and maybe be with someone who can openly explore intimacy with him. that's not me. i tried but it's breaking me.

i'm just letting this go into the void because i live alone and won't be seeing friends until tomorrow. i'm on my way home from work. i'll cuddle with my dog and try not to think about how he's doing and hoping he's okay.

post_03189,"how to make general physician prescribe me clonazepam? i'm 24 and i'm finally tired of letting anxiety ruin my social life. i've tried other things like lexapro and i didn't like the side effects and tried more holistic natural remedies like supplements and other things and they all helped but not nearly enough for how bad my social anxiety is.

i wouldn't want to take clonazepam every day of course. at the most it would be twice a week just when im socializing or on a date.

i don't want to be treated like a drug addict or told that it's too addictive. if i was an addict i would just buy pills from a shady place. i'm trying to get it the legitimate way and i've never even tried any benzo but i have serious social anxiety that really affects my life intensely and i want to try something different to actually improve my social life.

i know it's not going to magically turn me into a social butterfly but if i can just remove some of my anxiety then it will allow me to socialize more often and develop social skills better on my own without being extremely anxious and awkward.

a lot of people say that drs won't prescribe benzos if you ask for them but i'm a direct person and i have no reason to beat around the bush with this. i scheduled an appt in two weeks and i want to ask him straight up to prescribe me something for anxiety and i won't take any ssris because i don't like them. i don't understand why this needs t be such a complicated taboo thing. the people who get addicted are people who take it every day for months whereas i would be taking at most twice a week. at that dose it seems pretty innocuous.

is he going to give me a hard time over this or can i just tell him i already tried lexapro and want to try something that isn't an ssri and doesn't need to be taken everyday. i won't take buspar or any of these other random drugs they try to prescribe. maybe they are less addictive but they're mechanism of action seems way more shady to me and i don't want to take something that i don't understand. i just want something that will work quickly, last all day, and not have weird unpredictable side effects and clonazepam seems to be the best from my research.

what do i have to say to make him give me a prescription? i've never done benzos before guys it isn't drug seeking behavior i'm just tired of trying things that don't work and tired of social anxiety ruining my life.",0

post_00539,"the desperate desire to escape  i'm almost 40 years old and i have been suicidal for a good chunk of that, though i never did any real attempt. i doubt i will at this point, closest i get is doing overly risky things when the craving gets really intense. 

the thing that does it is being utterly disgusted with myself and also just stuck with myself. it's knowing every mistake i have ever made and having to re live them all over and over through my mind paralyzing me to any sort of action and making it impossible to get any satisfaction from things. and because of this paralysis my life slowly degrades and i find myself alone and destitute -- well for the most part. there's the part of me that fights to live and brings me back from the brink, but somehow i just find that brink over and over again. me and this world -- we are just incompatible. i want a divorce.

that has been my thought process lately anyway. a well worn trail of thought. but on the way to this sub i stopped by r/suicidebereavement and witnessed people on the other side of this pain. the rejection of world and self, reflected in another human. people whose lives get swept away by a horrible truth they could not change - sometimes feared and dreaded before hand and others falling out of the blue.

we don't come from suffering. we learn it and we carry it and we try to contain it but it just builds and feeds itself and spills out of us in horrible ways. it feels like the only way to get away, the only way to escape, is through our freedom, our will, our choice to not live. to me it doesn't seem fair that people should act so upset i want to escape. i have plenty of friends but i am pretty distant from all of them, and my family. i've had an adventurous life but i just feel like a lonely failure at this point and a burden to those around me and i just don't have the drive to keep trying. it's just not there. the car should run but it's not getting fuel.

yet for now seeing the glimpse of that other side - those who lost their kin - has me a little bit more stubborn to stay here. you may or may not believe in an afterlife, either way life continues after suicide. the pain i am so desperate to escape will multiply and move through the world, it will ripple out beyond my circle and through generations just like the pain i have inherited, even though i never had children. in the most bitter times this idea seems like the only way to be seen, the only way to be truly felt. every murder done from hatred is meant to effect more than just the dead victim, and most suicides are murders done from hatred. mine would be. whether i am killing myself or killing the world, it goes back and forth.

there has to be a better way. it's exhausting to try to hold on for the sake of family, especially if family has hurt you in ways that no one else could, in ways you can barely even admit to yourself. it's not worth it. don't hang on for your family. but maybe for someone you don't know? some random person, someone not unlike yourself, just trying to get by in this strange world. they will be affected. that ripple of suffering will crash into them and stick to them. 

so there's got to be a way. i'm not trying so hard to lock it all away, i don't try to hide it. i'm sick of feeling this way all the time and pretending it's not there. it's there and i hate it and if everyone around me is also ""going though stuff too,"" well, how come they all want to pretend it doesn't exist? why would we want to live in a fake world of pleasantness and suffering?

i don't have answers, just word vomit, and spelling/grammar errors no doubt. peace out for now, and know that every day that you choose to stay alive in this world is a gift you are giving to the people in your life, something we don't know is so dear until it isn't there.",1

 but in all reality, ive felt this way for many many years. i just havent had the gumption to make it happen. today i took some time to write some letters and do what i can to make peace with this decision. child custody battle coming back again and im just so ashamed of myself for abandoning my little girl. shes 7 and i love her more than anything. but she doesnt know what im suffering with. im behind on child support because i havent had work. her mom ruined my career when i was younger and i never got back the success i lost.

my passing will be cataclysmic to alot of people, people i know who love me and care deeply for me. but they all know what im suffering with and the worst part is that they wont be suprised. im just tired of life knocking me down after i try everything to get the building blocks back. i love all of my friends and i know i have a lot of value with people. but i cannot find value in myself.

the one thing i want known from this post is that im calm at this point, but i know things will get closer and i guess it makes time more sweet. the letters i wrote today will hopefully guide the people in my life through my own decision.

this last year gutted me and ive always fantasized about just going to sleep from an overdose. but im looking for the solution, not suffering. so ill be hanging myself. ive overdosed accidently in the past from anxiety meds and i know what that feels like. the last thing i want is to wake up.

theres no desperation to make this happen. im just packing for a road trip thats one way. thanks for reading.

post_02770,"i finally did it. over the last long while i have been avoiding others and trying to ghost friends and family so i can just be nothing in peace.

it was taking too long so i decided to take a drastic but honestly liberating choice, i scared them off with insults, harassment and anything to make them hate me. some i felt awesome doing to, as they were just bad people to begin with, others i felt bad about but know it was better for them this way. 

there are a few i couldn't bring myself to hurt, they're just good people and their lives are already bad as is, they don't need to think they're disgusting, annoying, ugly, pathetic or anything of the sort. 

i burned all bridges with the publishers for my works because they were just an escape for me, i quit my job and now i'm here. happy. 

now, when it's 7 pm i'm in bed and when it's the morning i stay there. after a while of this i'm probably just going to go out my window. i seem like i'm boasting but really, i'm tired of this, i just couldn't keep up with social interactions or caring about my future or work or anything that a normal person should. now i want to stare into the ceiling, listen to music and have a break, then die when i'm done, does that make me crazy? does that make me crazy? possibly. all i remember is thinking i wanna be like them, crazy, gnarls barkley is an awesome song, i recommend it. i wonder what song i won't hear? they're all so fucking good.

there is talk about sh here

i cant handle life, its to hard, everyday something negative is happening, i cant breathe without pain, constantly something bad happens. and yes there is a few good things in my life, but it is sufficated by all the bad parts. im going to therapy, and i recently got out of a mental hospital, but nothing positive has happened. and i know i have a good future, i know it takes time, i know all that shit. im not willing to wait. no future is worth this pain. i have no one irl. i have a barely existing mom, a lil sis who is the golden child that uses it for her advantage against me. i had a few escapes besides self harm to keep my away from suicide, like playing the piano, and the guitar. but the piano broke and i dont have the money to get it fixed, and i have to give my guitar away to my stepdad (my mom and him divorced and its technically his guitar) so i have no distractions. recently i got broken up with by someone i thought i would be with forever and that has hurt. rn im constantly alone, with only one person helping me, but he has been gone alot recently. idk what else besides suicide to do, waiting for it to get better is not an option, and i cant do anything to make my life better. self harm is the only reason im here rn. i wanna live i rlly do, i want to have a great life, i just cant handle waiting any longer. im not even sure if ill be able to handle one more hour, please help",1
post_04379,"it’s honestly baffling to me that there are people who approach new experiences without crippling fear seriously. i got a new job and i had my first real task earlier this week. and i spent the *entire* week in and out of anxiety attacks. couldn’t get out of bed. but also couldn’t sleep. i felt physically ill and wanted to vomit but i couldn’t. i couldn’t eat anything except some bread that i forcefed myself just so that i could take antacids. and all i could do was sob uncontrollably and think of how much i want to die. 

then the work task i had been dreading happened, and...my symptoms just melted away. it was almost magical. i felt so relieved but also so incredibly stupid. i *knew* nothing seriously bad could happen, that even the worst case scenario was pretty alright. but my body was just convinced i was going to die. it’s like my nervous system is a mechanical bull without an off switch and all i can do is hang on for dear life while it knocks me around and tires itself out. no chance at conversation or understanding, just mindless panic.

post_06828,"almost 25, got to take my shirt off in front of other people for the first time ever today and am on cloud 9. i have been morbidly nearly obese my entire life, i remember wearing a shirt in the pool at 8 years old. around 10, my obesity had gotten so out of control that i developed large stretch marks across my entire body. i remember looking in the mirror at this age and being so horrified by my body and yet clueless as to how i arrived at this point, i made the decision then that i would never horrify anyone else by taking my shirt off. i turned down every pool party invite, every boating or beach outing, anything with water, i was out. and for nearly 15 years, the only water that had touched my skin was that of a shower, until today.

i have lost over 250lbs. at 18 i decided to finally do something about my weight and the life i was missing out on living. i taught myself about proper nutrition, hit the gym, and got down to 150lbs from 400lbs+. i guess because of my youth i luckily dont have tons of loose skin, but i do still have the stretch marks which have mostly faded and i found a good concealer to cover the remainder. but overall i think i look pretty fucking good and am excited to look even better. 

some friends randomly hit me up and sent me directions to a pool party today and i just said, fuck it. showed up and popped my top off, quickly glanced for any horrified gawks, and there were none!! no one had noticed my body at all, and as i realized i was now swimming for the first time that i can remember, i nearly cried tears of joy.

post_05140,"my relationship with girlfriend has suffered from her mental health issues. me and my girlfriend have been together almost 2 years now. at the start she had some redflags but after pregnancy she turned in to the monster.
every day she blames me everything she sees around, her mood swings from loving me to hating me and she doesn't even believe anything anymore people tell her. i list here some main issues or symptoms.

- paranoid about everyone (mostly me) trying to make her more psychotic
- believing that nothing what she cant see is real, for example she can notice that our house is cleaned but if she didnt see me clean it she doesnt believe it and starts to blame me for doing nothing at home
- believing that she loves me, suddenly wants to breakup, suddenly loves, suddenly wants to breakup
- doesn't want to meet people anymore, scared of big buildings, public transport, we live in capital and she gets anger issues because city is too big (that wasnt problem before)
- believing that ive manipulated her parents against her and that she is always right and people lie to her
- can't trust any trustful sources example that city has job oppurtunities, she imagines that its not possible (basicly everything what nobody hasnt proved to her she doesnt trust)
- even things people can prove example shoving her money that we can afford to buy groceries she keeps repeating that how we gonna pay our groceries even she sees the money, she blames it for confusion
- cannot believe she have any paranoid thoughts or problems
- narcissist behavior, everything she does is okay but i cannot do. 
- she doesn't leave house because she fears i blame her cheating (even tho i let her go and say her its definetly more than allowed to have own time outside of the home) and its my fault that she cannot go.
- she wants to talk with me about certain things (like her past) and blames me that i asked questions about her, basicly she does things/avoid things and blames me because she believe her thoughts)

it's so stressful that she thanks me for cleaning the house and next morning she rages out i havent done anything in months, blames me bad father for not caring our children etc.

she doesn't accept that she have issues, she wants to isolate countryside and breakup but i want to make our family work. i know she have issues but i know she is not person what she is now.",0

my brother and i are several years apart.  growing up, we would wake up on christmas morning before our parents and eagerly lie awake in bed waiting for it to be ""okay"" for us to come downstairs for presents.  so at one point we remedied this by giving each other our presents for one another as soon as we woke up (usually at like 7 am) so we could enjoy christmas early.  we started doing this at like elementary school age.

i am thirty years old and super excited for my early christmas with my brother.  last time we did it, my husband stayed in bed while my brother and i exchanged gifts like little kids at 7 am.

post_06547,"i was raped by my girlfriend i am a 36-year-old guy and i was raped fifteen years ago by my then-girlfriend, who was 19.

i was 21 and she was the cutest girl probably on campus, and we took half the same classes. i was literally head over heels with her and after a few months, i asked her out and she said yes. we went on two or three dates and i thought i'd found the one. this girl was amazing, she was beautiful, really smart, and fun to be around.

she was driving us back from a restaurant on the fourth date, i think it was, when she stopped the car off on a side road all of a sudden. i looked at her, and she went on top of me. i tried to push her off but she pinned my hands down and started kissing me. i asked her what was up, and she said she was going to ""reward"" me by having sex together for the first time. i tried to say i wasn't really in the mood, it had been a long day and i wanted our first time to be more special but she'd already unbuttoned my pants. i really tried to get her off then but as much as it sucks to admit it, i'm not a very big guy and this girl was strong enough to keep me down. i decided to just let her go on, maybe she'd get tired. after her getting on me, though, i'd had enough.  
""i'm done,"" i told her. but we had already started. her eyes were closed and she went on for about five more minutes before she got off and i sat up and buttoned my pants.  
""you raped me,"" i said, and she laughed out loud. i honestly think she didn't believe she had raped me, because i was a guy and guys always want sex, don't they?  
""you're welcome,"" she said and she put the car into gear as if everything was fine. i let her drive us up back to my dorm which was only a few minutes away and when she tried to follow me, i told her i felt really sick and would catch her later. she scoffed but left and i went upstairs and just lay there all night long, not able to sleep.

i told my roommates the other day what had happened and they both clapped me on the back, telling me ""good job"". i decided i wasn't raped. there's no way a guy could get raped by a girl two years younger than him.  
i tried to forget about it. when she texted me a few days later asking if i wanted to go to this party her friend was throwing, i went, and then before it was over, pulled her aside and broke up with her. i blocked her out and ignored my friends telling me ""she got away"" and i made a huge mistake.  
for fifteen years, i've been telling myself nothing happened to me, i'm not a pu\*\*y, i didn't get raped by a girl.

today i admit it. yeah, i was raped. yeah, she was two years younger than me. yeah, i'm a guy. i don't fucking care. i was raped. i was raped and it's destroyed me, been destroying me since the day it happened.

post_05157,"lived three weeks like my husband. results were inconclusive here are my findings after three weeks living like my husband. out of curiosity to find out if his methods are superior and see if i feel any increase in contentment.

here is what i did:

-no strict deadline on chores

-no planning ahead

-do my hobbies with no regard for what else needs to be done

-no meal planning

-took hubby out for milkshakes when he looked cranky

-no laundry until i run out of undies

here is what i noticed:

-dusting doesn't actually need to be done weekly in my house (house looked the same after two weeks)

-meals got really weird and sometimes unhealthy but we always found something i guess

-sheets smell like sweat and actually need to be washed weekly

-kitchen became a huge mess really fast and it put me on edge. ended up more difficult to clean than usual when i did get to it

-garbage cans all over the house overflowed but i got to them eventually...

-i had a lot of fun doing my hobbies and made a couple things i'm proud of

-milkshakes made my husband more likely to hang out with me in the evening

-lack of planning led to forgetfulness and i ended up in public with greasy hair a couple times

-laundry took a couple days once i got to it and by the time i finished, the closet was full again

-the only part of the experiment my husband noticed was the milkshakes

conclusion: i'll probably keep up with the kitchen and bedsheets (bathroom too). maybe ditch the weekly dusting and leave it until things look dirty. keep the milkshake routine. idk. i learned less than i thought i would.",0

post_02967,"i've been to the bottom. maybe my story can help you climb back up hey reddit,

my first post and most probably last one :) 

i'm not sure where to begin, except to say that i've been… really, *really* down. like, staring-into-the-abyss, wondering-if-there's-anything-worth-fighting-for down. i'm talking about a cocktail of career setbacks that felt like personal betrayals, a social life that crumbled under the weight of my own insecurities, a family dynamic riddled with unspoken pain, and a marriage that, at times, felt like a slow, agonizing death.

i'm not going to sugarcoat it. there were days, weeks, even months where i didn't just stumble; i *fell*. i fell hard, and i stayed down. the weight of it all – the perceived failures, the loneliness, the crushing disappointment – it was suffocating. there were times i genuinely believed that the world would be better off without me. i contemplated ending it all. i won't go into the specifics, but those thoughts were very real, very visceral, and very terrifying.

i know there are probably people reading this right now who understand exactly what i'm talking about. that feeling of being utterly, completely, and hopelessly lost. the feeling that you're drowning, and no one can see you, or worse, they *can* see you, but they don't care enough to throw you a lifeline.

the truth is, i don't have a magic bullet. i don't have some profound secret that will instantly erase your pain. but what i *do* have is the experience of clawing my way back from that darkness. and that experience, i'm willing to share.

what changed? well, it wasn't one single thing, but a gradual shift in perspective. i stumbled upon stoicism. i know, it sounds a bit academic, maybe even a little cliché. but for me, it was a revelation.

before stoicism, i was constantly blaming external factors for my misery. my boss was unfair, my family was dysfunctional, my partner was unsupportive, the world was just *against* me. stoicism taught me that while i can't control what happens *to* me, i *can* control how i react to it.

it wasn't easy. it’s a constant work in progress. there are days when i still feel the pull of that old despair, the urge to just give up. but now, i have tools to fight back. i learned to focus on what i *can* control: my thoughts, my actions, my attitude. i started practicing gratitude, even for the smallest things. i started accepting the things i couldn't change, and focusing my energy on changing the things i could. i started understanding that hardship is part of the human experience, and that it can actually make us stronger.

one of the most powerful stoic concepts for me was *amor fati* – love of fate. it's not about passively accepting everything that happens to you, but about embracing it, seeing the potential for growth in even the most difficult situations. it's about recognizing that everything, even suffering, has a purpose.

i started small. i started meditating, even just for five minutes a day. i started journaling, writing down my thoughts and feelings, trying to understand them without judgment. i started exercising, even just going for a walk in nature. these seemingly small actions, repeated consistently, started to make a real difference.

i still struggle. i still have bad days. but i no longer feel like i'm drowning. i feel like i'm swimming, sometimes against the current, but swimming nonetheless.

and that's why i started a youtube channel. it's called worldshapershub - i know, it's just a small thing, but it's my way of trying to pay it forward. i share my story, my struggles, and the stoic principles that have helped me. i talk about mental health, relationships, career challenges, and everything in between. it's not polished or perfect, it's just me, being real and vulnerable, hoping that my experience can help someone else find their way back to the light.

if you're feeling lost, if you're feeling like you're at the end of your rope, please know that you're not alone. there is hope. there is a way back. and there are people who care.

i'm not a therapist, or a guru, or any kind of expert. i'm just a person who's been through hell and back, and who wants to help others do the same.

please be kind to yourselves. you are stronger than you think.

thank you for listening.",1

post_04833,"anyone else constantly have an upset stomach due to their anxiety? it’s a very specific kind of upset stomach that i get from my anxiety. it’s not a stomachache, or cramping, or “maybe i ate something bad”, it’s literally feeling sick with anxiety. i think out of all the anxiety symptoms i’ve experienced in my lifetime of anxiety, this is the absolute worst one and most likely the main symptom that will force me to attempt stupid therapy and medication again despite never having a good experience with either. 

i’ve already ruled many out other causes, and i know it’s likely only caused by my anxiety. i just don’t understand why my body and mind does this to itself. i can deal with shaky hands, or worried thoughts, or my heart racing, but feeling like your stomach is about to burst open and spill your guts everywhere makes literally everything 1.000% harder, no matter how happy you are to do something. no matter how much you care, or how determined you are to have fun, it doesn’t change a thing. 

it makes social events uncomfortable, it makes work extremely hard to get through. it just makes me want to curl up into a ball in bed and never leave. i don’t even need any suggestions for how to fix this. i don’t need to be told that i need medication or therapy. i’m just so tired of constantly feeling sick and no one understanding why or how it feels. no, taking a tums isn’t going to fix it. no, i can’t just “stop worrying”, or drink some damn ginger tea. i know a lot of suggestions come from a good place, but they don’t help.",0

i decided that i would claw my way out of the hellhole i was in, take what was mine and more, and get something good from the universe. i would do whatever i can to surpass the people that ruined my life and look down at them. and if i die before i get to see their disgusting faces all weak and sad then i’d never forgive myself.

post_05194,"embarrassed of myself about my daughter’s last name 
my daughter was born from my previous marriage (he died) her last name is “very” hispanic (puerto rican), people often mispronounce it. i am white and asian, very white passing and my daughter is also white passing. she knows her grandparents but they are still grieving their son and aren’t super close to her. they also live on the island.

i am now remarried to a white man (with a common last name). we’ve been together about 5 years and adoption has come up. my heart believes the 2 of them need to decide that… my daughter sees him as her dad, she was very young when her dad was gone and has mostly known my husband as her dad. he has made it clear he is her dad and adoption changes nothing, he wants to adopt her. 

i want her to have white last name mostly because of how we both look. i grew up with an asian last name and didn’t look japanese enough and didn’t speak it much (grandparents were immigrants and didn’t want to speak japanese around us) i am proud of who they are and proud to be japanese but it doesn’t change how i was judged.

i know puerto rico is a us territory and there’s no immigration issues but i feel a little ashamed for wanting her life to be easy, the political climate adds to my anxiety. some ahole sees a hispanic person or hear a hispanic name and makes assumptions. 

i thought of changing her middle name with the adoption to include his last name, but she (12) wants it changed, she also doesn’t want her last name because she feels uncomfortable saying it. she hasn’t been around her culture, and it wasn’t her choice, it was her grandparents’. she also loves her (step) dad and wants us all to have the same last name. i know it’s small and i feel stupid but i just wanted to get it out.",0

if  you ever met me, you would not have the slightest clue that i've been  diagnosed as clinically depressed. i've had multiple suicide attempts,  one which was truly close where if i didn't have the appropriate medical  attention in a given time-frame i would not be here. i've been with  psychiatric teams, and a few therapists. it's all a temporary measure in  the end.

i am a 'high performer' in my  workplace, and i have many who rely on me for support. i always smile,  and i try my best to make others happy whenever i can. but at the end of  every day, i feel empty. most times i have suicidal thoughts. there are  people i am able to speak to and 'open up' about how i feel, however  you can only share how you truly feel one so many times before it  becomes a burden upon them.

in more  recent times, my negative thoughts are becoming more prominent. i have a  strong feeling i may be edging towards attempting suicide once again.  i've taken a few days off work hoping it may help, however i believe  with the absence of working it allows my head to fester these urges and  suicidal thoughts more rapidly.

there is a  brief moment of what i can only describe as insanity that grips me, and  it is at that moment where my life hangs in the balance. whether it's  my belt around my neck, a blade against my wrist, or pills in my palm. i  have managed to so far overcome each mental battle in those moments in  these past few weeks, however it is likely i may soon lose.

i  am not here for advice or sympathy, the purpose for this post is to  just say depression does not discriminate. you do not have to have been  through a traumatic event, or to have certain physical attributes you  hate, feeling alone etc. to be depressed. sometimes you just are, and it  could be for no particular reason at all. we are all human in the end,  and we're all on the same spectrum. best wishes to you all.",1

we were all sitting at the table and my boyfriend (m30) had a bad day so he slapped my child so hard he fell from the chair. my bf got mad at me because after the incident i was holding my son in my arms to reassure him that everything was fine.

he had no marks on him but i felt so disgusted and angry. i still am. i wanna leave him. i just don‘t know how.

my son‘s no verbal so he gets frustrated when no one understands him. it‘s still no excuse to do that!!

even sometimes, my bf gets frustrated with my child when he can‘t do something quick enough. i‘ve understood now that he‘s a ticking time bomb.

update:

i‘m overwhelmed with all the help and advice you all gave me! thank you so much, i felt more confident after reading these and broke up with him.

my child‘s the most important thing in my life and police are already called.

for those who didn‘t understand why i did nothing when it happened, it is because i‘m not as muscular and big as him. i‘m petite and he‘s far more strong. when my baby fell from the chair, i protected him with my body, it was the only thing i could do. we all were so shocked and couldn‘t believe it happened.",0

post_06013,"i did it. i just resigned from my career in law enforcement after 15 years, foregoing my retirement so i could get out most people close to me think that i’m retiring, and they don’t know that i just have had enough. it was a complete surprise to the department, and a shock to my family. i just couldn’t do it anymore.

i started my career as a police officer about 15 years ago. i was so excited to help people, and to keep people safe. i worked for a large police department with a great record of community involvement, and with very progressive policies. i felt like it would be a good fit. 

i excelled in the profession and after a few years was promoted to detective. i worked in major crimes, investigating violent crimes. i eventually specialized in crimes against children and joined a federal task force. i’ve gone all over the us investigating child predators and felt satisfaction that i was doing the right thing. i also became certified in training law enforcement in implicit bias recognition, and ensuring that everyone was treated fairly. 

the problem started when several years ago, i observed an officer get into an argument with a suspect in handcuffs. it escalated when the suspect said something about the officer’s wife, and the suspect was thrown to the ground. the officer jumped on top of the suspect and began punching him in the face while he was handcuffed. i intervened and stopped the officer, and then reported what happened. i gave a full statement under oath of exactly what happened. instead of being fired, the officer was allowed to resign, and he wasn’t charged. i knew i did the right thing, but always felt it was mishandled.

from there, problems started. the supervisors started nitpicking everything i did. i was denied promotions, despite having an absolutely stellar record. many other officers refused to work with me since i reported what happened. i was transferred to a position that limited me in using my abilities. and as things arose in the news over the past few years about bad policing, i noticed a change in how the rank and file did their jobs and interacted with the public. there was an overwhelming sense that police weren’t appreciated, and that set up officers for negative interactions because they’d show up just waiting for someone to start filming and calling them pigs, etc. mind you, this rarely happened.  but from the times it did happen, it created an “us vs them” mentality. morale dropped and the department i worked for, which never had an issue with recruitment, started being understaffed. this created an issue where those that usually wouldn’t make it in the hiring process would be hired. then, they’d be pushed through the 18 month training process, and then would end up interacting with the public. this led to more “viral” issues because of “contempt of cop”, and then slowly the department started losing credibility in the community.

the final straw for me happened earlier this year. when the capitol insurrection happened, i was *shocked* at how many apologists there were who defended the actions of the mob there. politically, if you weren’t conservative you were a cop-hater. having always been left of center, i’d insert my opinion in conversations based on facts. then it’d get shut down that i was addicted to the “fake news” of npr and cnn. i was even reported once for “hurting morale” and was lectured about talking politics, even though everyone else did and my views were different than theirs. 

just after this, there were a couple of police shootings in the news and officers were either fired or charged. i watched the body cam videos that were released, and the decision to charge it fire the officers were completely justified. everyone else around me tried to shoehorn excuses for the officers, which was directly against all sanctioned training. then, the chauvin trial verdict came. suddenly, from so many decision makers on the department, he was some type of martyr. having been a tactical controls instructor myself, i knew that his actions were in direct violation of all standard policies for the past 25 years. still, people wanted to justify it in some way that made the police martyrs who were publicly crucified for their bad decisions. 

the day i submitted my resignation, i was called into my division’s captain’s office. the captain brought up a recent conversation i had while training new recruits in basic tactical controls. i made it a point when talking about restraints to point out how chauvin’s tactics were exactly what we were trying to avoid when restraining. one of the recruits filed a complaint saying i was “promoting liberal politics” in training. i explained my position to the captain, who listened to what i said and then replied, 

“andy, you need to choose what side you’re on. either the police, or the media.” 

all of the work i’ve done for the last 15 years, all of the pedophiles and murders i’ve caught, all of the lives i’ve saved including officers, was reduced to an us vs. them mentality. i was disgusted, and walked back to my office. i typed up my resignation and returned 20 minutes later and handed it to the captain.

i’ve forfeited my full retirement since i’m not staying for the full 20 required to collect it. i don’t know what i’m doing next, but i know that i couldn’t take one more minute in that environment. i began my career to help people, and now the mission is to “preserve the profession” instead of serve the public. 

i haven’t told anyone the real reason i’ve quit, because i don’t want to get caught up in debates about the merit of my decision. all i know is that i’m free. i’m half-heartbroken, and half-relieved. the only way i’d work with law enforcement again is if i could start some type of training firm that focused on the best implicit bias training, and the safest tactics. i’m just not sure there’s an appetite for that among police these days. 

anyway, i can’t get this off my chest anywhere else, so i’ve done it here. sorry for the rant, but there are few that i can actually explain this to without causing a shit storm. thanks for listening. and sorry for any grammar errors, i didn’t check it before i posted.",0

i am alone. my family don't really care about me. my boyfriend spends most of his day locked up in his room talking to his shitty friends who hate me. my best friend stopped trying to help me months ago and practically just watches as i descend into the worst mental state i've ever been in my life.

i don't know what to do. i feel like i've tried everything. i've tried reaching out, tried making appointments with a therapist, tried speaking to them. but nothing ever happens. i don't expect anything from anyone anymore. i don't make plans with them anymore. i don't reach out to them. they always end up canceling, or making excuses, or finding any way to drop me. i'm always the one left behind. they never care about what i have to say. i exist solely for them, not for myself.

post_05322,"i’m sick and heartbroken and depressed i’m sick. and i don’t know what i’m sick with. i’ve been sick on and off for three years, but it’s really bad right now. i can’t do anything and everything is falling apart. 

i was making something of myself. spring of 2022, i started dating the love of my life. he was my best friend. i was living with my parents and he moved in with us for the summer. i was the happiest i can ever remember being. last january, he told me he needed space. it came out of nowhere and i felt so blindsided, but i agreed. i gave him space. but then he wanted less space. we were long distance and he lived a couple of hours away but before christmas we’d been seeing each other almost every weekend. after christmas i didn’t see him until february. 

i was working on my masters. i was getting my life together, working hard. but my health started declining. i spent a month in january/february taking classes from home because i was too sick to make it to the school. i didn’t know what was wrong. i still don’t really know what’s wrong. some things have gotten better and i’ve done some tests, but i’m so tired all the time. i spend most of the day sleeping and the rest of the day lying down. i get so dizzy and i keep fainting and my heart rate is constantly through the roof. 

my partner and i broke up in the summer of 2023. i thought i was going to die. i wanted to die. he’d told me i could rely on him, that we were going to get a house together someday, that we could get a pet. he told me  that he couldn’t picture a future without me in it. he told me that he didn’t know if he wanted kids, but if he did, it would be with me. but by the end, it was like he didn’t care about me at all, even though he said that he did. he kept saying he would come see me, but he cancelled every time. even when we were breaking up, he said he would come so we could talk in person, but he never did. he told me i could talk to him about anything, but when i tried to tell him how hurt i felt, he blew me off. he never wanted to hear it. 

the final straw was when he said he was going to stay where he was the next fall and start a school program. he’d said we would discuss our plans together, but then sprung that on me. there was no discussion. there was no room for me in his life. i’d had this stupid dream that we’d be together that fall, that we’d make it work. but he didn’t want that. he didn’t want me. not badly enough to try to be with me. 

and i just keep getting sicker. it’s been six months since we broke up and i’m supposed to be working on my final project for school, but i’m too sick. i’ve had to break my lease in my apartment and move back to my hometown, back in with my parents, because i don’t want to take out more student loans if i’m not doing schoolwork and i’m too sick to work. i’m in my parents’ basement, in a room that’s mostly being used for storage, living out of suitcases for the last month. i’m trying to find a tenant for my apartment and i’m trying to take a leave of absence from school and i’m trying to make living here work. but i’m so tired. and everything is so difficult. 

and the worst part is that he’s here. the program he’d been planning to do was in another town, but he decided to take a job here instead. he’s living with my brother and his wife (they were all friends before he and i got together). he’s just across town. but i can’t reach out to him. i can’t put myself out there when he’s given no indication that he’s willing to put in any effort for me. i can’t open up to him only to be shut down again. 

he said he wanted to be friends but i barely hear from him. and i can’t pretend that i’m not still hurting, that i have no anger, no pain. i can’t just be friends and act like everything’s okay. 

but i miss my best friend so much. i miss my boyfriend. i miss the love of my life. i miss having hope and excitement for the future. i miss having someone who loved me more than anyone, and who i loved. i miss feeling alive. i miss doing things and spending time with the people i care about. i miss having a purpose and drive and ambition. i miss going out with the dogs and hiking and going to hot yoga and dancing. 

and i hate it here. i hate this room. i hate that he took his stuff out of this room but he left his ex’s stupid fucking wine rack that she didn’t want. i hate that he’s not here. i hate that every inch of this house reminds me of him. i hate that i’ve lost everything i’ve worked for, and i don’t know if or when i’ll have the energy to fight to get it all back. i hate that he’s going to move on and meet someone else, and i’m going to be stuck in this basement, too sick to be wanted. i hate that i’m barely a person anymore because of this illness. i hate that he gets to have a life and move on and be happy. i hate that i’m in pain all the time. i hate that i’m getting fat because i can’t do anything. i hate how pathetic i am. i hate pretending i’m okay when i’m not. 

and i’m not okay. ",1

post_05328,"struggling to understand my feelings about this man i 18f was close with this boy, for animosity i’ll refer to him as “cole”.

i have known cole since 3rd grade, and during the time i’ve known him he is honestly the most kindest and funniest person i’ve ever known. he was close to everyone, the community knew him and his family, he had a strong connection with her father and brother which i admired.

we were good acquaintances since we’ve been going to a k-8th grade school, i’ve always known that i had some sort of feelings towards him, but i feel like it’s developed into some fantasy that i just imagine us in and not actually reality.

i’ve been insecure about my body being more of the “chubby” gals so i never made a move and just accepted us as good friends.

in 8th grade he started dating a close friend of mine, i wasn’t really sure how to feel but i supported both of them and kept a distance.

but i could see she was just using him, ( this was his first relationship ). she’d always boss him around and get upset taking out her frustration on him, then to learn that she took his v-card pushed me away from them both even more.

fast forward a year and some traumatic events happened to him ( family loss ) and they broke up. i felt bad for them both but then he confided into me more, which was a first and i honestly liked it, i was glad he was able to open up and talk to me.

this continued during my freshman and into my sophomore year, i visited him and tried to open up myself but it was just awkward.

i confessed to him during my junior year and we made plans to try to go on a date, but never did. soon i didn’t know but he just left and join some sort of bootcamp.

i soon found out later he was dealing with his own feelings and problems that i couldn’t help but i always told him i was here if he needed to talk, being supportive and just wanted to make sure he was okay.

he soon graduated and messaged me explaining his emotions and just how ashamed he was, and anger and just threw himself into that school.

after that our lives just got busy and we do talk sometimes but it’s more me initiating it. i’m struggling to understand where it went wrong or if i’m just being led on then ghosted. should i just accept us as friends or try again?",0

i think it’s time i go to my spot and shoot myself in the head. 

i’m 25 years old, i know i’m young but i’ve already endured so much pain i don’t know how much more i can take. i lost my brother to suicide by train when i was 6 years old.and right after my 22nd birthday my father shot himself in the head with his revolver. about 6 months later, my uncle shot himself in the head. 

i hate myself, i really, really do. the world had turned me into such a bitter person and even at work ( i’m an armed security guard i catch myself constantly thinking about suicide. i concealed carry as well so in a way it’s comforting knowing i have the button to end it at any time.

literally the only thing stopping me is my boyfriend (22ftm)  that i love with every fiber of my being. i really, really don’t want to hurt him. this would crush him and he would never recover and i could never forgive myself for it. 
 
every day is a battle for me at this point and i’m constantly hearing this voice in my head that says “he killed himself,” as if it’s talking about me in the third person. it’s my voice, but i hate it. i already hate the sound of my own voice and i don’t feel like i fit in anywhere. i’m sorry for ranting, i just don’t like life right now and i’m not sure i want to partake in it anymore.

for example, if i’m in the car with someone else, even my own family, i skip over some songs i like or turn them down, just because i don’t want them to disapprove of it or have something negative to say. 

or, i’ll not want to buy certain clothes out of fear they’ll disapprove or have something negative to say. i even stopped listening to an artist i loved because someone important in my life kept putting them and their music down.

post_01652,"i don't know why i'm still alive. i have no idea why i am still alive and why i still have contact to people. everything hurts and i've completely given up on almost everything.

depression has been a part of my life since the age of seven, i can't imagine life without depression and suicide thoughts because that's all i ever think about, no matter what. yes, of course i have times where i feel wonderful and where my life is going somewhat decent but life is completely fucking with me. even though i have amazing friends and a wonderful boyfriend that keep up with my shit. 

my best friend, ""m"", has never met a me without depression. when i moved away from the place i grew up (which really effected my mental health because i had to leave the people i grew up with) she was the first person i talked with. the first friend i made, the first day of second grade, she was there. she smiled at me and we walked home together. ever since that moment i knew she was a keeper. and she is, she's seen me in the worst possible states but also in some great ones, and i appreciate her and her presence. she is a great person, just like her boyfriend. ""l"" is my male best friend, and i brought him together with ""m"". they are like siblings. siblings that listen to you and want you to feel alright. 

but now, to the people that made me depressed. my family. my father is pure hell but i love him, even though he is a shit father. i try to keep up with him and to spend time with him because he has cancer and diabetes. but i haven't talked to him in a while, even though we literally live in the same house. everytime we talk it's just yelling because ""i'm the reason why he's dying"" and ""everything is my fault"" and because ""i'm ruining this family"" everytime he says shit like that, i believe him. i am a shit kid because he is a shit dad, but i can't control myself. i'm the black sheep. the one with the dyscalculia, i'm the one with depression, i'm the one with bpd. i'm just the mentally ill one out of the other 3 perfect kids my father has. i am the outcast, i've always been. 

my mama.. i don't know what to say about her. she met my dad at a very young age (she was 15 and he was 32) and they've been together ever since. she is.. complicated. i can talk with her but i can't. she's very irrated after work and she works almost everyday so i get yelled at and shit at when the house isn't clean or something. but mama listens to my cries because she sees that i'm struggling mentally, but she's never sent me to a therapist because she tried to ""fix"" me herself. (she's a psychologist.) she is a total sweetheart and an amazing mother, but when she's pissed, she drops very hurtful things. she always says i'm like my dad. last time she said that i broke down crying, saying ""i don't want to be like him"" and she just said ""then don't be."" which didn't make it any better.. :/ but, me and her had many deep and sad talks. i once asked her ""why didn't you leave?"" and she was like ""because he wasn't like this back then and now i can't leave because.. what kind of shit move is it to leave the guy that cared for you so many years, right as his health starts to get worse?"" i just looked down and nodded, saying that i get what she is saying, because i do get it. 

to my siblings.. they are complicated. they treat me like dirt but they love me. one of my little sisters, ""i"", always tells everyone irl that she loves me and that i'm her favorite sister but at home she puts me down. probably because she sees that dad gives her praise, but oh well, what do i know? and yeah, the youngest, ""c"", just purely and truly hates me but also loves me sometimes. everytime she does some shit, she puts the fault on me and they believe her which pmo so bad sometimes. but do i put up a fight? hell no. and well, my older brother, ""a"" is.. scary. when we were little we were best friends and hung out together. but now he hates me. i don't even think he remembers the shit he's done to me. i remember so vividly the one time he tried to f*ck me. yes, f*ck me. he was like.. 13? and i was 10. he wanted to stick it in till he heard our parents car pull into the driveway. i thank god that nothing happened that day. i don't hate my brother, i just find him weird. he hates me but he doesn't? i don't know. i feel uncomfortable around him most of the time. but.. yeah.

and now to.. my baby, my everything, ""k"". kevin has been my boyfriend for two months now and he's heard about the shit i'm going through. he wants me to go to the police the whole time because my dad sometimes still tends to be abusive but my heart can't handle sending a cancer sick diabetic old man in jail for treating me like shit for years. he's a huge prick but he's my father and somewhere i still love him even though i want him dead sometimes. but, ""k"" has been there for me in every single situation, trying to make me feel better and to cheer me up, he's the best boyfriend a girl could ask for, like.. seriously.

this is a long ass fucking vent and i'm so sorry to anyone who's reading this but i just can't anymore. 

i want to stay alive but these thoughts and voices are getting louder everyday. i have a lot of reasons to live, ""m"", ""l"", my mom, my boyfriend, ""k"". but i feel like they are getting tired of me. it's the same shit everyday. i'm happy, i lose energy and ignore them because i'm crying or slitting my fucking wrist like a fucking selfish bastard. i promised mama so many times that i'm going to stop but i can't. i seriously cut to feel something else than this crippling sadness. the sudden bursts of energy and happiness make me insane, i don't want to he happy for few minutes/hours, i want to be happy for a few days, weeks, maybe even months! but i guess that's too much to ask. 

i'm sorry for venting. i'm sorry if this is tmi. but i don't want to keep on living, not even for my favorite people, i'm just fucking tired. sorry.

post_01831,"so much pressure my life fell apart years ago and i just feel like i've been desperately scrabbling, trying to keep it together, ever since.

i spent the last 2 years homeless, sleeping rough, couch surfing and in shelters. my daughter had to move in with her dad, who she hadn't seen in years because i left him when he hit her. now i'm in an apapartment, but i can't get her back because i live with my older brother, a fucking creep who molested me when we were kids and said to my face i shouldn't trust him around my daughter.

i'm ldr with my wife, who lives in the us, during all this fucking shit. my beautiful, wonderful, incredibly supportive partner, who is trans and stuck back home, with her mom, in fucking florida. she has no job, no income. i get unemployment benefits, i got her a passport, i got her first visa, i'm supposed to get her here.

i don't have children and have my flat set up for a young professional/ my mum loves bringing ornaments over, so it's really really not child friendly. we talked about this in the week to how i'd panic if his son was here as ill need to pack alot of things away and tidy up etc (still got stitches in). it's saturday and my bf text me to ask if he can bring his son over to dinner and a bath...i'm so frustrated and feel like the conversation was pointless in the week and i'm currently running around like a headless chicken shoving breakables into boxes.

i'm going to get straight to the point. yesterday i called
my best friend because 1 felt myself slipping into this low
and usually just talking to him helps me from falling but
as soon as he answered he told me he was on his way
to the hospital because his brothers not okay. obviously
i told him i'm here for him and his family and didnt
mention my low at all. asically idk how to handle my
low when my person is going through worse.


and for those who are going to say i need therapy, i just
started 2 weeks ago, i dont have any tools yet but i will
talk about this next time i see him.


think whats getting to me also is that l'm not the one
hes going to. when i texted him to check in he replied
saying he needed to be alone but also posted to his story
that he was driving home from his friends house. also
i'm not going to mention how l'm feeling or that his story
at his friends house and his text to me contradiction. i
have before when nothing bad was going on and i just
get yelled at for ""being a detective"" but at some degree
i'm wondering if hes the first person i call and i'm the
last person he calls is this really a friendship? but also ik
nows not the time to leave.

post_05286,got dumped over my depression and now i feel like a fuxking asshole my mental health got the best of me again and screwed my 3 year relationship with the most beautiful caring and down-to-earth girl i've ever met. yes i can happily admit i am depressed and when that happens i get into these moods which shut anyone and anything out and i get stuck in my own head. without even realizing it i've pushed her away to the point of no return and her leaving made me snap out of what i was going through or whatever was in my head. i even noticed that i am not myself some days and i want to tell her but the way i grew up we never talked about mental health or being depressed in anyway and its holds me back even when i fight the urge to get up and tell her it still overpowers me. i don't want to change solely based on her leaving but for me to become a better person or at least the person i was before all of this happened. she said she's already made up her mind and wants to leave and i completely respect that of her choice but a part of me still has hope that with a strict therapy regimen and changing the way i hold myself in situations and stop getting mad over stupid things that spiral me out of control i can pray to whatever is upstairs that i can some how change her him. the amount of love i have for this person is outrageous and i've never felt or been with someone as long as her. i acknowledge the fact that i was a complete fucking stupid and horrible boyfriend and i acknowledge the fact that she's been hurt by me multiple times without me even knowing it i want us to work out i really do. ,0
post_02072,"i’ll be gone tomorrow  hello all, 

i'm writing here to say goodbye. ive spent a lot of time on this subreddit on my main account, looking at posts over the years, trying to talk people down, reaching out, so i felt i should say bye. 

it's my time. i have tried for a very long time to get past the way i feel. i'm 27 now; i've been fighting this feeling off for 14 years. 

i never did well in school, failing then dropping out. i can't focus long enough to learn or grasp anything. i actually had some motivation last year to further my education and got my ged. however, after i got that, i realized i didn't have motivation to do anything else. i have no goals, no aspirations. trust me, i want them- i've tried forcing myself to have them- i just can't. when i was younger, i had dreams of being a violinist or an artist. obviously these were not realistic, but they were the only things i had even some interest in. i don't do art anymore, as i'll go months, sometimes years, without wanting to make anything, and then i've lost all my skill by the time i want to make something again. i stopped playing the violin when i dropped out of high school; a few times throughout the years, i've tried to pick it up again, but that spark just isn't there anymore, and i can't teach myself. 

i don't have my license- i have my permit, but every time i've taken my test, i've failed it. i've failed my driver's test 4 times.

i can't maintain relationships; i get stressed out and have so much anxiety and turn into such a control freak. i've been trying to be better about it, but at this point i don't have the energy and love to give someone. as much as i would like to maybe find someone, it isn't fair to someone for me to seek out something like that when i can't keep my shit together. i can't even trust anyone anymore; i've been abused, raped, and used. it's always there too; it never goes away. i don't like having sex anymore; it's all i think about when i do. 

i work shitty call center jobs, and i've been laid off from my last two. i've been without a job for the last three months, and i finally start a new job next week, but i won't make it until then. i can't do it again, 40 hours or more a week for a shitty company for low wages, barely able to take care of myself. wake up, work, barely have enough time for myself, and on the weekends have no energy for anything but laying around. its so incredibly mundane. 

no aspirations, no goals- the only thing i do in my spare time is just play video games, it's the only thing i can even remotely enjoy anymore. i was trying for a really long time to stick around for my cats, i love them so much, but i can't do this anymore. i only have two friends left, who are my roommates. 

this isn't for a lack of effort. i've done therapy multiple times, and i've maintained a normal gym routine and gone outside. i've tried pushing myself to make more friends, but i don't even have an interest in social interactions anymore. if anything, it makes me anxious; i never leave my room anymore except to make food. i just barely feel anything anymore. just an overwhelming sense of loneliness. i feel like there isn't anything left for me. i know for a fact i'll never go anywhere in life, and that's okay. i'm not meant to. 

so i've decided tomorrow night is my last one. i'm going to write my letters tonight, this one included. i'm going to spend the day tomorrow with my cats, play with them, and give them lots of love and treats. spend time with my roommates. play my favorite game one last time. listen to my favorite songs. drink to celebrate. then i'm done. i tried, but i can't try anymore. i have no fight left.",1
post_03379,does anyone else have to check things because of anxiety so for awhile now i’ve been needed to check my  doors are locked if i don’t it bothers me   especially when i am trying to go to sleep  i also have to make sure the taps are off the toilet lid is closed and the shower  door is shut if i don’t do the checks my brain gets anxious and won’t  be quite about it ,0
post_06821,"it's funny how when you stop being so submissive, everyone thinks you have an attitude problem. i've always been a quiet guy, a yes man, wanting to avoid trouble. i'd do as i was told because it was easier. i'd agree with opinions to avoid arguments.

but since i came out of the closet, i realised that was my real reason for being so reserved, and since then i have been a lot more open and honest with people, i've stood my ground and argued my cases.

and it's funny how much people want to try and make me retreat. every time i point out the reality of a situation in a frank way, i suddenly need to ""watch my attitude"". they're not happy with who is suddenly in front of them but i tell ya it's not going to change. i finally feel confident enough to have a say in things, it feels like a new hobby i'm constantly going back to lol.",0
post_06381,"met my biological dad for the first time ever and i’m very happy about it (update) lots of you asked to let you know how it goes meeting my biological dad and to say it was emotional….is an understatement. i’ve been feeling so many things since this all happened. 
we met a few days ago. was originally supposed to be almost 2 weeks ago but shit kept coming up. work and then i got sick (not covid) for days.   but we made it happen. tbh this was more nervous for me because i didn’t know anything about him. with my bio mom it was different because i watched her from far and got to know her a little before it came out. i asked my bio mom if she could be there too just because she knows him better so it was the 2 of us waiting for him at this park. 

he was already crying before we even got to him. this guy is strong too so he pulled me in for the biggest bear hug and crying 😅🥲

he told me he wants me to know that they loved me so much and he loves me. i lost count how many times he’d come back in for one more hug. this definitely got to him. and he kept saying thank you god a few times. looking at my face. the feelings man, the feelings… we had so many of them. hearing him tell me how much they love me even back then. it meant so much for me to hear that and ngl that had me holding him tight too. 

i’m sure to everyone at the park it was weird seeing 3 crying people lol. my bio dad said he cried so many times just driving over here he didn’t think he had anymore tears until he saw us. when we were all sitting down it hit me that my bio mom was not lying when she said we look alike 😂 obviously he’s older but still holy shit the similarities. 

he brought gifts too which was a surprise. it was really nice he told me i don’t have to keep them if i don’t want it but he felt weird not coming with anything and he’s wanted to give this to me for a long time.

one was a teddy bear holding a picture frame of him at the hospital holding me (he was 15 years old, it’s still crazy to realize that ). and then the other thing was a journal. the journal thing was stuff he said he started writing to me years after i was adopted. he was in therapy and that that helped him to cope thinking he would give them to me one day. his way of still feeling connected to me. i haven’t read everything yet but some of the pages were  his thoughts and like if he’s talking to me. how he felt when they found out she was pregnant, then the adoption, everything going on in his mind when he first got to hold me as a baby. i didn’t even know he was at the hospital too.

it was not what i was expecting.. it really got me. i read some more of what he wrote last night that really got me crying. 
i’m sad to think how much this affected them emotionally for years. also think it’s pretty sweet he wanted to write this for me. we talked about his own life which was pretty hard. his struggles with home life and the feelings he had about giving me up. then he wanted to know everything about me. basically with the same questions my bio mom had. i made sure they knew they made the right decision. because my life was pretty great. 

he looked like he wanted to cry when he knew that because that’s all they hoped for and it was something he always wondered about for years. my bio mom left a bit after we were more comfortable so we could talk more in private once it didn’t feel too awkward between us. from there he told me stories about how he met my bio mom. sometimes he’d point out stuff he notice about me that reminds him of her or me and him having similar likes. 

example: i love eating mangos. i can eat them all day and that’s what i bought when we bought snacks at the park. 
he told me my bio mom was obsessed with mangos seven before she got pregnant, while pregnant she craved it even more. 

just cool info to know even if it’s random stuff lol. it’s still stuff we have in common and we both have lots. both like hiking, playing pool, he was a swimmer in college and i was on a swim team in highschool, both love rock music. especially 90’s. my bio dad was really open about sharing everything. like he really was getting ready for this meeting. he hoped it would happen and he prayed everyday to see me again because he had so many things he wanted to tell me. overall really good first meeting. i’m glad how it went. he’s open to the idea of meeting my parents. after i told them about all this because they definitely want to meet my bio parents again if i’m comfortable with that, obviously if my bio parents are too. let’s see when that happens. idk how it’s gonna feel for me. they’ve met eachother before i was even born but i never had them at the same place so that’ll be interesting lol.

me and my parents met up yesterday to have breakfast so i could tell them everything. my mom was so happy how it went. she actually cried too whne i was telling them about both their reactions. my dad was proud because he knew how hard it was the months after finding my bio mom and not really wanting to make contact yet. i’m really happy to have their support because it’s hard not to feel guilty about wanting to know more my bio parents. they gave me a really good life so for a while it’s felt like maybe to them i’m showing them that wasn’t good enough for me and i’d rather have my bio parents. but they told me many times they want me to do this for me and the know how much i love them. and i really do. 

finding them and meeting them was hard. but it was so worth it to me. and seeing their reactions made it feel even more worth it. still can’t believe it sometimes. 

i’m just realizing this has turned into a long post, my bad haha. writing this has been therapeutic tbh. kind of thinking back to everything that’s happened. feeling really grateful. 
again wanna say thank you to everyone who has been on this journey with me. everyone who sent me their own stories, their love, their encouragement. you guys have beautiful hearts and i’m happy i had somewhere to talk about all this and receive so much love back! just wanna say to all the adopted kids out there, i wish you guys luck and that you find what you’re looking for. it’s not easy at all. i feel fortunate that things didn’t go badly or that my bio parents aren’t bad people. and to all the birth parents out there who made this sacrifice, thank you 🙏🏻 🙏🏻🙏🏻it’s because of you there are kids out there like me who got to have a great life with loving parents ❤️",0

post_03780,"struggling to cope with adjusting to new meds i was on 75mg of effexor for awhile, but i didn’t take it consistently, and never refilled it. i recently had an appointment with my doctor and he put me on 15mg of buspirone twice a day as well as 75mg of effexor once a day. so, for two days i’ve taken it as directed along with my adderall for adhd on weekdays where i have classes, and the multivitamins i try to take. overall it’s probably not a lot compared to most, but it feels like so much for me. i took my pills yesterday and still feel them in my throat today. and i know it takes a while of consistency before i start to feel better, but going through the adjustment is killing me. i’m depressed when i usually don’t struggle much with depression beyond a few rare instances of a couple days of bedrot. last night i had three back to back panic attacks and my anxiety is horrible. i can divide the buspirone into three, and was advised to do so if i had a lot of side effects, so i might do that as i’ve felt ill. it’s just…it’s only been two days! some people go through this for months?! how am i supposed to get through this adjustment??",0
post_04903,"i got scammed for 2k i feel a lot of guilt rn, i feel stupid and ashamed, because i should have known. it was a phishing call that lasted like one hour from the ""notary office"" about some property papers (which we are at the moment actually trying to release but paused for a couple of years now) and my only family member ""being on the line"".

i already talked to my bank, the police, and a lawyer, and it seems theres not much hope to recovering my money. 

that money was part of my 3 year savings. i will need a minimum of six months to save it again if i try really hard (keep in mind im not from the us or eu)

at the moment i'm trying to cope with the fact that im not getting my money back, called the psychology assistance line and it did offer some help. i cant tell anyone close to me because im too ashamed, now that i look back on everything that happened it was really stupid of me. 

i already deal with anxiety and self criticism/despise thoughts on my day to day, and this just feels like confirmation. 
i cant sleep, i feel pressure on my chest and i just keep thinking on what happened over and over again and how i should have reacted, i cant concentrate on anything and just feel awful overall. any advice on how to stop doing this to myself?",0

post_03167,"desperate mom- extended release, liquid/gummy melatonin (1mg) hi all,
my 7 year old is currently spiraling with anxiety that keeps her awake. 

she cannot stay asleep. she can fall asleep no problem but wakes up every single night at 1am and then 4am with anxiety. 

we have an appointment with a psychiatrist but it’s not until the 18th. 

between now and that appt we met with her pcp today who recommended we try to find melatonin that is extended release. here’s the catch: it has to be liquid or gummy and it has to be 1mg 

(my daughter cannot swallow pills)

i went to 5 pharmacies today and called countless others. i’ve search online but no luck. 

anyone know of an online retailer that sells extended release, 1mg, liquid/gummy melatonin? ",0

post_05270,"friend/roommate is drug addict without prospects. friend of mine from college (call him tom) ended up as my roommate (along with dick, tom's other friend from college).  tom's a great guy however i'm concerned he's becoming a liability.   

he grew up in a cult, ended up drifting into college with a pretty worthless degree.  he graduated  but still doesn't have any direction in his life.  missing a lot of critical life skills. doesn't know how to drive.  is scared to learn.    so his options have been limited to whatever is within walking distance.  he found a job, and for a while things went okay.

covid happens and dick inherited some money from his grandma so he ended up working from home. i think he does some kind of remote work and day trading now, besides his mmorpg addiction. he got more into drugs.  and eventually he offered some to tom.   which tom enjoyed occasionally. and things were ok because the job didn't test. 

two years ago tom lost his job, mainly between his issues and is discipline and judgment declined  because of the drugs. apparently a manager said something to him, and he responded unwisely in the heat of the moment.

it took tom almost a year to find a new one. (good thing he had savings, otherwise he wouldn't have been able to meet his share of the obligations) which he's kept but it doesn't pay nearly enough. apparently he's constantly borrowing money from dick and still using.   suggestions to him to lay off aren't well received. other attempts at good advice are blown off.   and he's got so many bad financial habits.  

i've done what i can to try to help tom, but he can't seem to stop tripping over himself or pull himself together.  i'm at my wits end and i need to move on to something else, i can't continue to stay here with tom and dick. problem is he's one of the closest things i've ever had to a brother and i seem to be one of the few people in his life that actually cares.  i hate to write them off, but i can't continue like this.

post_00817,"finally realized that suicide is the only option obvious tw for suicide and mentions of rape and abuse

i’m 17, yeah i know i’m young i have my whole life ahead of me blah blah blah. but i don’t. i don’t have a life ahead of me and i know that. my life was everything but good. for ten years i was raped, abused, physically and verbally by my dad. court system came in, stopped seeing my dad. the new family member i lived with? also abusive, not physically at least, yay. developed anorexia, she would take food from me and tell me i was too fat to be eating (i was 13. i weighed 125 pounds.) the things she told me still echo through my head every day. same with my dad, i’m still the stupid slut bitch i was when i was 7. school? far from an escape. i was bullied, am bullied. from kindergarten and now to high school, i was an easy target. i think it’s important to mention that i have autism, so right off the bat i do not fit in. on top of my depression i developed as a child and anxiety, making friends didn’t come easy to me. do i have friends? yes, and i love them very much. i’m tired, though, tired of staying alive for other people’s sake and not my own. it feels selfish, everybody says suicide is selfish, but to me it’s not selfish on my end. it’s selfish of my friends and family, for them to beg me to stay alive in a life where i just want to fucking die already. i have basically every fucking mental disorder you can think of, many think i have bpd (can’t get diagnosed though because i’m 17) and it’s basically most definite that i have cptsd. i know how the lives of people like me go. my dad had the same life i did, raped and abused as a kid. how he turned out? a rapist, abusive piece of shit addicted to every drug and substance you can imagine. my sister, raped and abused, now an alcoholic drug user. both have tried to kill themselves multiple times. both want to die, everyone tells me “you’ll get better with age, it gets easier” and then i take a look at them. they are in the same boat as me, same fucking situation. they still want to die, they don’t enjoy living. bonus, they’re fucking deteriorating because of their substance abuse. i’m not going to live a life like that, hell no. and god, i truly pity my mom. she was the only person in my life who tried. who tried to make it easier, tried to help me, tried to make my life good. well, her and my grandfather who died when i was 13, so yeah, just her now. but she wants what’s best for me, and that comforts me, because dying is what’s best for me. now, the last 16 years i was like no i’m not gonna kill myself but i never planned on getting older? like i’ve tried to kill myself, but pussied out each time. this is different though. in june, i met a girl. we met through a friend, we fell in love, like hard. we had promise rings, plans to get married and have children together. i loved her, i love her so much. we broke up five days before christmas. my mental health was too much for her and she never told me until it built up, i said that if i get to be too much if i vent too much or stress her out too much to tell me and she didn’t. another contributing factor, those previously mentioned school bullies? she’s best friends with multiple of the kids who made my life hell. i finally told her, she told me that i probably just didn’t remember right. it was a “good terms” break up and she said she would come back when she can work on being less distant of a person because she knew it hurt me. (how the fuck does breaking up with me make you less distant? couldn’t make it make sense if i tried.) i digress, she was the first person who made me happy. since i was a kid, i could physically feel my sadness, in my chest and stomach and head, and when i first met her, it went away. for the first time in my life i felt okay. and she’s gone. i never had a planned future until i met her, and now i’m back to square one, no future. i can’t be talked out of this, and i know there’s no hope for me. not sure how i’m gonna do it, but if there’s a will there’s a way. if i can’t be with her, the only good thing about this shit life, i’m not gonna be alive. she knew this would happen, during the break up she made me promise her i wouldn’t kill myself after this. i promised, but hey, she promised me we would be together forever. we all make promises we can’t keep. i’m gonna start writing my notes, but i wanted to write this first. maybe somewhere deep inside me i’m hoping someone can talk me out of it, maybe i just wanted to scream into the void, “hey, another life lost because living fucking sucks.” i don’t know. nobody knows anything about life and living. so why the fuck am i living??",1

post_04681,"i quit my six-figure job to recover this was possibly the hardest decision i’ve ever had to make. i’ve been at this job for 5 months now and the workload was immediately unmanageable for one person but i kept pushing through thinking i was just weak, i needed to work harder. after all this was an opportunity of a lifetime and others would kill to have this job!

it got to a point where my anxiety and depression was out of control. i dreaded work every morning and was crying 3 times a day every day for a month. i couldn’t stomach any food until dinner time. i wasn’t taking breaks and i was doing 12 hour days. exercise was out of the question of course.

i knew i needed to quit but i felt like i couldn’t. i didn’t want to be that person that gives up. on top of that i felt incredibly guilty that if i did quit, my workload would be dumped on my boss and the team. i was (and still am) anxious about what people think of me. do they think i’m a quitter?

all i was focused on was others and i forgot about me. how sad is that. 

the past week i managed to scrounge up the pieces of myself scattered across the floor and peel myself out of bed at 6:30 to run in the morning. i may have severe anxiety and depression but this is the one thing i can do for myself. 

i still have this nagging thought that i am crazy to throw away this salary but at the end of the day no amount of money is worth trading in my mental health for.

i don’t have a fully laid out plan of what i’m going to do but all i know is right now i need to heal and recover. financially i am okay and my angel of a partner is supporting me in this.

i am by no means on the other side yet but i thought i would put this out into the world for anyone else who feels stuck in their job and afraid to quit. feel free to dm.

update: writing this update on 10 june 2022 (a week out from 1 year ago). thank you to everyone that commented at the time. your encouragement really helped me through a tough time. over the past year i have consistently received private messages from people that have gone through or are currently going through the same situation.

at the time of my original post i felt so alone because i couldn’t find other people going through the same thing. i thought i would just be sending a rant into a black hole and it wouldn’t mean much but it has really been worth putting out there just to see how many people have reached out and the conversations that have come from it. 

as an update, i took 2 glorious months off and looking back, quitting was the best decision i ever made. i was ashamed and guilty for a while but i had the gift of time. to do things i wanted to do that had nothing to do with work and to heal. of course i had incredible support so i could focus on building myself back up. i’m now back at work at a previous job (before the heinous one referred to above) and i’m doing well. i still have anxiety obviously but off anti-depressants now.

if you’re ever in the same broken state i was, i know that hesitation so well. i know its a tough decision but i still 100% recommend quitting. a career is not the entirety of life.",0

post_04805,"i have illness anxiety disorder, and failed to get my scheduled covid-19 vaccine a few months ago. yesterday i bit the bullet and got my first dose! yayy! i'm not an antivaxxer! i believe in modern medicine. 

i was always scared of getting the vaccine, because we don't know the long-term effects of it. and i was also scared of getting it with the medication combination i'm on for my bipolar disorder, because i didn't know how it could react. 

the first time i told myself i would get it if i stop taking my medications a week prior to clear it out of my system so i can get the vaccine all by itself. that was a huge mistake, because of my bipolar disorder i became very mentally unstable which also in turn exacerbated my anxiety. and so i failed to make the appointment. 

this time, i got the vaccine and ironically i wasn't on any medication at all because my doctor took me off one medication because of it not working, and also because i've been in a major depression the last two weeks i literally forgot to take the other of the two medications for a week straight. *yes!, really it's as simple as i forgot, i know it's bad*. 

so not only did i push through the anxiety of getting the vaccine, i also got what i wanted in that i got it without being on medication. *it wasn't on purpose i swear! haha* 

my arm hurts like hell and i feel really lightheaded and dizzy today but otherwise i'm okay. 
however i am highly unstable, because i'm not on any medication and my doctor is gone for the next two weeks on vacation. another psychiatrist at the clinic told me not to restart my meds until i see my psych. (after stopping lamotrigine for more than five consecutive days you can't just simply restart it, you have to retitrate up to the target dose again)

the pharmacist as well as the nurse at the vaccine site said it's okay for me to take my ativan, a benzodiazepine, before and after getting the vaccine but i decided not to because i fear mixing it with the vaccine. 

so i am just pushing through the anxiety that the symptoms are giving me and i'm doing okay! 

but i'm super proud of myself for biting the bullet and getting the vaccine as i am much more scared of catching covid-19 than i am of the vaccine.",0

i was mortified, i had no idea what was happening and i didnt know if i should call for help or not, i honest to god thought she was dying or something.  i asked her again what was wrong and if there was anything i could do for her. she told me ""i started my period, do you have any painkillers?"" i shuffled through my drawers for some advil. i took 1 out of the bottle and gave it to her, but she took the bottle from me and emptied 3 more into her hand and swallowed all 4. at this point i felt useless so i went to my mom for help. she immediately knew what to do, she grabbed some pads, tampons, and a heating blanket to give my friend.

now, i might be a complete idiot with a lack of knowledge on this stuff, but if i know one thing for sure its that girls love chocolate during this time. so i made a quick trip to the gas station for some snacks while my mom assisted her. it was a small gesture, but it was the only way i knew how to help her. when i got back she seemed to be doing better. she wasn't sweating profusely anymore, she was calm and not writhing in pain like before. after the pills kicked in she was able to function again. she was able to settle down and we went back to playing games.

i'm shocked this was from period cramps. i know cramps are painful, i just thought it would feel more like a quick punch to the gut, a brief pain that goes away after a few minutes. i didn't think it would be equivalent to having your organs harvested by aliens. i guess it was hard for me to conceptualize just how painful they can be for some women since i've never experienced the pain for myself. i'm sorry some of you basically die every month, that's gotta suck and i sympathize with you.",1

post_01007,"whst a life this is. so, i'm 17 now. everything feels so different and the same, i still feel like i did when i was 12 during peak covid, i'm laying in bed every day doing nothing but it had real consequences now, i'm close to being kicked out of college because my attendance is so low and honestly i don't care. i'm clearly not okay and it feels like nobody is noticing, my sister recently got diagnosed with cancer and i want to be there for there because she's going through so much, she has two kids and i want to offer to babysit but i'm so unreliable, i skip out of plans like they don't matter because i can't bring myself to get up. last year i got so close to ending it, i told my mother, she kept pressing and pressing when i sent her a long text telling her exactly what i needed from her in that moment but she basically ignored it. then in november i actually tried and it was pathetic, i thought i could jump into a river and it would do most of the work but it didn't, it was waist deep, i just stood there and then had to wade through the water to get out, it left me aching and so, so cold. i got home and had to lay under my blankets for hours so i didn't become hypothermic and it was pathetic. my room smelled like mildew until i could bring myself to put the clothes covered in the much from the river into the washing machine. i'm starting to turn to substances and my mother is helping me indulge in it and i know it's wrong but i can't bring myself to care, she says i can smoke or have weed because she's scared of losing me, she doesn't know how to help and it's damaging but at this point i feel like i need to get high to make it go away for a bit. she took me to the gp the morning after the night i told her i was going to end it and the guy was nice but not even he could do anything, the youth service said two years ago i've done everything they could recommend and they accepted that self harm was just something i did. the man i saw in the gp said i most likely couldn't get onto antidepressants until i was 18 because they can make teenagers more suicidal but i honestly don't think i can be more suicidal at this point. i need help and i've exhausted all the resources. every day it gets harder and i'm just doing nothing, i can't go to college without pain, any amount of light gives me migraines, people on campus won't stop meowing at me or asking about why i don't use my cane on campus and it's exhausting, i have to wake up at 6 am to go at 8 am to college and i get home at 5 which doesn't seem like a lot, especially for people with full time jobs but i can't handle it, i come home in pain and exhausted, i can't even use willpower to get myself to college every day, when i was going in the first term, i had 100% attendance for the first two weeks and even then i was planning what days i would have time to shower, wednesday's are half days so usually i'd shower on wednesdays and monday mornings and that's it, i feel gross and disgusting for it but at this point, i've attended college twice this year and i haven't showered since then, i'm disgusting and i hate it but i can't even bring myself to take care of my hygiene or anything, i've had two of my molars surgically removed already and i'm still not brushing my teeth, i haven't gone outside, i don't know if i nescaserally want to die but i do know i don't want to live like this. my ex who i never properly broke up with started dating someone else and unadded me on everything when we were actually on good terms. i have a few friends in college but i don't know if i can even keep going for them, they're all so nice and they deserve to be happy and i can't stop thinking about how much it would hurt them if i was gone, one girl i talk to most is so nice, whenever i'm in college she talks about how she missed me and it makes me happy that someone cares but i also want to distance myself from everyone so it doesn't hit so hard if i do end up gone forever. last year i got the confirmation that my hospital can't do anything else for my eyes and they've steadily been getting worse, my nystagmus has too and it's exhausting, i can't sleep and when i do it's always too much, i stay up for days and sleep for twenty hours, i want to tell someone, to get some kind of help but i've lost hope, i've already been failed multiple times already. i don't want to fail myself by giving in and letting go of everything i've been working so hard for. i never got my gcse's because my attendance in secondary school ended up being 0.05* in the end. my college attendance is 43% and there's always a meeting lined up about it, they're going to kick me out and i won't have a path to follow anyone and it's terrifying. i'm scared of growing up because i was never treated like i would, if i didn't make an effort to make myself look as unique as possible, the only thing people would look at me and see is my blindness. i want to be someone and i'm afraid of the very real possibility that i never will be. i lost my binder a little after christmas and even though i don't use it all of the time, it was oqe if the only things that made me feel more comfortable and gave me agency over how i looked. i'm so scared.

sorry for the rant and i'm sorry if it doesn't make sense, i'm not thinking straight and i don't know what to do anymore.",1

post_06834,"i got hit by a car to save someone's dog today and got the money i needed to see my best friend overseas. edit3: i'm camera shy but will eventually update this w/ the images some of you are seeking. 

edit 2:for those who are asking in the comments, i did get myself checked out and all is well : )

edit: didn't expect this to blow up like that, oh my gosh 🥺 thanks for gold .. thanks for everything!!

i went out in 90 degree heat to take out the trash and saw a grey dog along our fence. i rose an eyebrow, and decided to follow her. don't know why. nagging feeling. she, with her stubby legs, took off in a sprint, unfitting for a dog her size. 

i didn't feel right. i kept walking in the sweltering heat and saw that she was so dead set on running into the road. i started sprinting too, my lungs starting to burn. my asthma was flaring up already. i kept running, let my vision start to blur until i saw a car coming in our direction. i took one breath, and jumped into the road, shelding that innocent dog with my body. the car sputtered to a stop and slammed my side. i'm all bruised up, but the dog was safe.

i apologized to the driver (who was speeding prior and was even more apologetic to me.) i decided not to say much more than ""its okay."" i let her go. usually i'd be more cruel and standoffish, but today, i'd just be her reminder to slow down a bit. walked off with some bloody bruises. whatever.

took the dog home. saw she was covered in flies. introduced her to my puppy, who of course, barked like an idiot (she doesn't know how to greet anyone properly. kinda my fault, kinda her genetics fault. whatever.) and then sped around, playing and giving the new doggy her toys. we'll call new doggy brisket. that's what we called her, jokingly, until her owners were found.

brisket was sweet and kind. she grunted and snorted and panted a lot. i gave her some water and let her relax and do as she pleased - such a sweet, sweet girl. her and my pup got along so well. she ate snacks from my hand, and gobbled down food as though she'd never eaten anything ever - but somehow, with her own, flat-faced grace. she loved snacks. i was so happy.

she was so dirty. i gave her a bath in a nice shampoo and conditioner, just for dogs, brushed and combed her out, spritzed her with deodorizer and even used a baby-powder scented disc to keep her smelling good. gave her a chew and let her feel the breeze on her now clean skin. i spent hours petting and cuddling her, and teaching my pup to be gentle and calmer. 

i found her family's info through the same system i used for my cat when he went missing. i remember finally working up the courage to call. i hate phone calls. despise them. but i know what it's like to be without answers. without closure. 
i got an answer right away. they told me that ""brisket"" had been missing for days and had wandered 45 minutes + on foot from her home. we packed up the car , and brisket, and my pup, and made the quick drive.

they cried and grabbed their dog like a very-loved and worn doll, kissing her, crying and wailing in the doorway. my pup wiggled and barked in excitement. she settled herself for the first time. good girl. 

i planned to see a friend overseas this year before my covid vaccine card ""expires"" in that specific country and to finally feel the salty ocean air. thought i didn't have enough money to go anyway , and put it on the backburner until the pandemic decided to fade. maybe things would be better then.

...the lady in the doorway handed me just enough money to fulfill the final part of my dream, and shooed me away, insisting that i take it all, despite my protests and refusals.
i don't know if there's a god, or if fates a thing, or what ...

.. but damn, i feel pretty confident that there might be.",0

post_00322,"i want to kill myself i’ve wanted to kill myself for years because of all sorts of trauma. my brother sa me, my mom beat me with a slipper and when my sister tried to protect me she got kicked out of the house (she was later let back in), all my moms boyfriend where abusive smokers, my dad threw my brother into a wall (my dads changed now), etc.

i had cut myself once with a small knife on a keychain, i haven't done it again but i've thought of doing it.

i tried to kill myself but then i saw my cat watching me and decided to wait for her and my rabbit, i didn't want to leave them.

i tried to overdose by taking 14 pills but failed. i panicked and told my brother, he asked my why i did it and told me not to do it again. he told me to drink some water and to try to stay up. the next day i was sick still (i was already sick before that) and slept all day. the reason i slept all day iscuse my dad gave me too much nyquill but when my brother went to talk to my dad he asked if i had told him what i did. my dad said no so he said nvm and tried to leave but my dad stopped him and told him to tell him what happened since it might be whats wrong with me. my brother told him i took 14 pills since i was sad. i heard this all since i was sleep in my dads bed (he works from home) and i've been in and out of conscience. hours later my dad woke me up since he was leaving, he said i needed to wake up since i’ve been sleep all day and that we’re going to granny’s so she can help me. when we got to her place and where getting out to car and asked me about what kai said then said if i ever tried that again he’d beat me. a couple days later i was going to my moms so she picked me up. in the car ride she confronted me about it, she said that she tries to comunicate with me and that i need to cominicate with her then proved to threaten to beat me if i ever tired that again. (the reason i tried to kill myself is cause of my mom and school and her never being satisfied with it.) this was a couple months ago.

i still want to kill myself and every day just makes it worse. every time i pick up something sharp i just get these little thoughts in the back of my head that says to stab myself right then and there. those same thoughts tell me to cut my wrist, to slit my throat, to jump off a building, to drown myself. every time i get close to it i get scared. i have animals and a nephew to take care of, i just became friends with and old friend again, in for months i’ll be legally aloud to get a job, i have younger siblings and cousins who would be sad if i succeeded, i have an older cousin who’d punch a wall and an older sister who feels responsable for me.

but despite this all i still want to kill myself. i know its irresponsible and selfish of me me but i just can take any of this anymore. i just don't know what to do.",1
post_04970,"i don't know if i'm desperate or not but i'm sick of being single this is a rant and for the first half of it my keyboard was set to a different language so autocorrect couldn't save it and i apologize ☝️

my one and only relatively serious relationship was like a few months in ninth or tenth grade and im now nineteen years old starting my second semester of college and still nothing??

like sure i think i'm ugly but when i think about it i dont think i'm the worst at least?? like i wash my hair every day (yes i know it's bad for my hair but i have hygiene issues), brush my teeth every day, use whitening strips sometimes, the face wash ive been using for the past few months has made my skin clearer than it's been since fuckin infancy, and still my only serious relationship ive ever had was in ninth grade because both of us were desperate

and ive liked many people since then, but no one has liked me back, and i get so worried that im just desperate that im terrified im gonna do something wrong. i could never really tell if i liked someone romantically or platonically before, but i met someone that was different and i knew it was romantic and i almost thought it might have been reciprocated and then they asked me to take them shopping for a valentine's gift for someone else. i'm like i genuinely don't understand how it's this impossible to get a partner. i mean i know i'm oblivious (i had someone like me years ago and he only told me about it after he had stopped liking me and i literally never realized) but at the same time, i feel like i'm always looking for romantic interests so i'm always hoping someone likes me, so i see signs in gestures that aren't even romantic.

i'm almost at the point where i'm considering dating apps, but then that really sets off my ""oh my god im so desperate i need to work on myself so bad why do i need someone else to love me in order to feel validated i should not even start dating anyone until i like myself more""

but i'm so fucking sick of thinking that. how fucking mentally perfect and stable do i have to be until i allow myself to love someone??

ive seen people in much worse mental states and situations date healthily so why can't i?? why does the thought of resorting to dating apps make me feel so fucking worthless??

like i genuinely don't fucking know how mentally healthy i have to be until i stop fucking assuming i only want to date someone to validate to myself that i'm loveable.

it feels like i've never been anyone's first choice in my entire fucking life and i genuinely don't fucking know if that's just me hating myself or if it's actually true and that's what's fucking me over

like sure i wasn't picked first for soccer because i didn't try because i was afraid of people setting expectations on myself and failing them but i really didn't think it'd be the same fucking thing for dating??? am i not trying enough?? am i trying too hard?? 

i understand that it's really fucking unhealthy to be this upset about this but ive been second pick to literally fucking everyone my entire life and im so fucking sick of it and i want to be good enough to be someone's favorite fucking person and i dont fucking understand why i cant have that

yes i fucking know i sound like a spoiled brat right now but you don't get to judge me on this sub so i get so say what i want and i'm saying i want someone to spend all my fucking time with without worrying about them fucking hating me

i'm so sick of my mind constantly going on and on and on ""your friends all hate you they only hang out with you as a joke they're gonna abandon you as soon as you start asking too much they're staring at you because you look fucking moronic everyone is staring at you because you didn't shower today they all think you're fucking disgusting and they hate your cringe ass haircut but your hair looks ass no matter how you cut it and they can tell and they're laughing at your posture and they think you dress like a child and everyone will stare at you if you go to the gym because they can't believe someone like you is going there and if your shoes are too loud people will think you're obnoxious and you probably waddle when you walk and your glasses make your nose look fucking massive and if you wear makeup everyone around you is thinking you look like a pig with lipstick you look like a child playing with their mom's makeup and no one wants to be around a spoiled fucking brat"" and then there's ""maybe none of this is true maybe people just don't wanna be around you cuz you have a terrible fucking personality maybe you're really a massive b and you just don't realize or maybe you're too loud or maybe you act like a fucking child""

i'm so fucking done with hearing this shit in my head all the fucking time but then i'm like ""having a partner would fix all that cuz then you'd finally be someone's first choice"" and then i'm like thats so fucking unhealthy i shouldn't even let myself date anyone because what the fuck how can you love someone when you have that many fucking problems with yourself

so yeah that was my day, how's yours?",0
post_00045,"why tf did i do this yesterday my teacher, one of those i trust and admire, asked me if everything’s alright. he’s asked me that before, where i just shrugged it off, but this time i just broke done. i told him everything about my situation at home, which i think is neglectful, leaving out my sh behavior and suicidal thoughts (just the day before i attempted, which made me so much more emotional)

now i feel so fucking stupid for telling him, i feel shame, cause the things i was talking about were so fucking more dramatic than they are and really fucking embarrassing, i feel so incredibly guilty for making him waste his fucking time on me, even though i feel like those aren’t ,,real” problems i’m facing, i’m not facing any physical abuse or extreme forms, and i feel like such a fucking burden for putting this onto him. he told me he doesn’t really know what to do, and to get more insight on my case he will talk anonymously to professional for help, and i feel so guilty for putting this pressure onto him.
and i feel fucking violated. idk, i’ve never talked to anyone about my problems, if i do i get these crazy panic reactions, which i also had when i talked to him. i feel violated talking about my feelings, issues, thoughts, feel like there’s something genuinely wrong with me and now he knows. now he knows how fucking pathetic i am. i feel so fucking violated, i’ve never had anyone listen to me like he did, but i don’t know if i liked it, i felt so incredibly transparent, and it’s scary to know someone got to hear about some of my most inner thoughts and worries.

idk, i kinda regret talking to him, i don’t know if it was a good idea. it does keep me from attempting anytime soon, i promised him to talk about the situation again the next days, but what i’m feeling right now is so fucking intense and it makes me short circuit every time i think about it.

was that the right thing to do? i feel like i shouldnt have done that, or at least not talk to him, my teacher, about this. but then, i don’t think i trust anyone enough to talk about it.",1

post_06248,"our entire family got destroyed after my brother was kidnapped i got told to post here instead.

i feel like i need to write this. i don't know why.

my older brother was my best friend. he had a severe stutter but he never let that slow him down. literally everyone loved him. he was smart, handsome and one of the kindest people i ever knew. he was so fucking nice to me. he used to let me tag along with his friends and always shared any treat he had.

we would have ""sleepover"" in his room and just havevfun all night.

when my brother was 14, he didn't come home from school. i was 10 then. but even then i know that something was very wrong.

my dad was a police officer so everyone suspected it was retaliation for something. i'll never forget my father blaming himself.

my brother was taken from us for 3 years.

a year ago, they found him locked in a room. the kidnapper had killed himself and tried to kill my brother too but had failed.

when we found out he was located, we were all so happy. but it immediately became obvious that we couldn't celebrate yet.

my brother had been severely abused for three years. he was not the same person that left us, and i couldn't blame him.

he didn't talk except to scream at my parents and blame them for taking care of him properly. he shut himself in his room and refused to try and talk to mental health doctors.

last november, my brother committed suicide. my dad found him. i don't think i'll ever forget the sound my dad made that night.

our whole family is kind of broken. my mom is depressed and sleeps all day. my dad just works 18 hours a day. he can't stand being home. we don't really see each other much even though we live in the same house.

and i'm just here, wondering what i need to do. i sometimes fantasize about going to hell and fucking beating the motherfucking bastard who tortured my brother to a bloody pulp.

i want to tear that pig's eyes out.

i'm so angry sometimes i feel like my brain is going to burst. 

it's so fucking unfair. i never even got to hug my brother again after he came back. he wouldn't let me. and it's a regret that keeps me up at night a lot.

despite what happened to my brother, i'll always remember the way he was. the best brother i could've ever had.

and i'm so sad he had to go through what he did.",0

post_03749,"buspirone and wellbutrin -severe anxiety hey everyone,

i've been taking buspirone 10 mg and wellbutrin 150 mg for my depression. initially, i was experiencing dizziness when taking both in the morning, so i switched to taking the buspirone at night. despite the change, my anxiety remained pretty bad, so i eventually started taking 10 mg twice a day. at first, i thought it might have been helping, but lately, my anxiety has been through the roof. i'm very jumpy and easily startled, and i often experience chest pains that sometimes lead to minor panic attacks. my mind is always racing with worries, and i'm constantly paranoid about various things, always stuck in the ""what ifs.""

i also feel as if i’m exhibiting symptoms of ocd. i catch myself having ruminating thoughts along with a fear of even cooking using the gas stove because i always think i’ll leave it on. i'm afraid to use my dryer due to it causing my building's smoke alarms to go off the last time i used it. years ago, i lost my whole house in a fire caused by the dryer in my home. i am afraid to even leave my dog alone sometimes because i think there may be a fire.

has anyone else experienced something like this? have any other medications worked better for you? i'm still trying to figure out what works for me. i've tried lexapro before, but it didn't really help either. i just want to stop feeling so scared and jumpy all the time. any advice or shared experiences would be greatly appreciated. thanks!",0

post_04262,"stop telling me everyone has anxiety! i understand anxiety is a common thing and happens to everyone. but it’s still an incredibly invalidating thing to hear. i’m not sure everyone spends over half an hour picking out an outfit, can’t get on the bus by themselves because they’re irrationally afraid of pulling the stop cord wrong, or overthink everything, down to how long they should toast their bread for.

i don’t think i’m some special case or anything, i know many have it much worse. i often excuse my constant worrying by prefacing to someone that i have anxiety, and hate when they just say “oh well everyone has anxiety”. 

i know that, but sometimes, i wish someone would just say “thank you for telling me.”

post_01212,"trapped in a life i dont like i will be quick. i've been bullied a lot growing up, from classmates, family and even teachers. i think that's what lead to this overwhelming waves of emotions i get and that make me desire death. i cant get rid of what i've been bullied for, simply it is part of me. i could get it surgically fixed if i had a ton of money but i dont. honestly tho, i understand that is not the reason i got bullied, it was an excuse. just like any other could have been. 

despise knowing this i cant help but yearn for death. i hate being trapped in the same skin and body i got so much made fun of. some days i dont go outside coz i dont want to be seen. its been almost 10 years with this kind of thought and knowing that i probably cant heal and that i cant die either makes me suffer even more. 

my parents want me to have a family in the future but i dont want to pass down my genetic curse. if i had a kid and she came home crying into my arms i dont think i could ever forgive myself. 

i still get comments from strangers about my appearence and it's so humiliating to not being able to change. 

the only plausible option is that i have trauma regarding that, hence why i cant seem to move on. i'd like to die but a few friends made it clear that i would be missed, i also watched some documentaries on families who lost a family member coz of suicide and i just cant! i just dont want anymore pain, i dont want to cause any but i'm so tired!

the only thing that helps me calm down is knowing that my body is healthy and i am able to experience life with very few limitations, in other words, i'm lucky. besides a few moments where i feel blessed i just cant help desiring to die. i would love to change, i am hopeful that maybe i could one day be free from this but i am so lost, idk where to start. maybe i only need to focus on being here right now. honestly i have no idea.",1
post_05911,"daughter accidentally spilled jello my daughter just spilled her whole cup of jello on the carpet. and she just looked at me and said “mommy i spilled”. she was so calm and just asked for help. i walked over and helped her clean it up. and i just realized something. 

now this may sound silly but the fact that she was calm, not scared or trying to hide it.  not terrified or crying or anything. she didn’t think she’d be in trouble (which she of course is not). 

but it made me so fucking proud of myself. i didn’t scream at her like my parents would have. i didn’t tell her she’s stupid or get angry at all. and the fact that she knows that. she knows it’s ok to make mistakes and i’ll just help her.

post_05267,"working with kids with autism has been a revelation for me bt = behavior technician. a behavior tech is someone who works with kids with autism to help them meet certain goals such as responding to their name or sitting down for a certain period of time.

as a bt, i’ve only been in this profession for around 5-6 months, but it’s taught me so much about my own life. i myself am autistic, and received aba therapy when i was a toddler. however, when i moved schools, my mom hid my autism diagnosis so that schools wouldn’t discriminate against me in terms of academics. 

so, i work with these kids, and if i’m gonna be honest, some of them are better at socializing than i was in 10th grade. they have friends, and they seem to be more responsive than i ever was. it wasn’t until 11th grade(aka when i had to try to get a job), that i realized how socially behind i was. yes they have meltdowns and behaviors, but so did i at their age. 

to put it shorty, i was raised without friends. from 2nd-7th grade, i pretty much had no friends, not even any school friends either. i had no idea how to socialize with others, and i just watched, sad inside that i couldn’t do it like others could. my mom tried to put me in social skills groups, but those classes are terrible and don’t teach anything imo. if they did teach me anything, the skill wouldn’t generalize and i would completely forget it. the only way to learn how to socialize, is to just trip over yourself 1000s of times while others judge you for not knowing what they do. my 12th grade year was terrible because of this, as people made fun of me for reasons i couldn’t decipher until i had already learned my lesson. 

i had online friends before i had friends in real life, it was that bad. oh, and i didn’t get those until i turned 13.

it wasn’t until 12th grade that i ever got to hang out with someone. to get that, i had to observe every person, read every expression, notice their body language, nod at them, say more than what i felt like; i had none of these skills mastered until the end of 11th grade. not to mention, my style was terrible and i had no knowledge of trends. it didn’t help my parents were divorced either, as that definitely hurt my social skills too.  

working as a bt has been a revelation because i now realize it wasn’t my fault. i tried my hardest, but even i needed support when i was younger. i see myself in some of the kids i work with, and i’m hoping they can have a better social life than i ever did.",0

post_05337,"we are so screwed i live in the united states of america, specifically in oregon, and i have a strong perspective on the current political, social, and economic climates in our country. first off, i want to clarify that i don’t align with any political party, and i never will. as a citizen of this nation, i believe it's clear: we are on a precarious path. it doesn’t matter the timing or the individuals involved; the reality is that this country is heading toward significant turmoil, and it’s likely to happen sooner rather than later.

historically, we’ve struggled to get things right since the inception of our nation. not long after declaring our independence and gaining recognition from great britain, we stumbled into our own revolution, where citizens revolted against the very government we established. then came the american civil war, an unnecessary conflict over a deeply flawed system that should have been resolved much earlier. instead, we dragged our feet and squandered resources on wars over the years that weren't even our concern some of which i can in fact argue were somewhat justifiable.

we often tout ourselves as a superpower, proclaiming that we are the greatest country on the planet, but the truth paints a different picture. we face numerous economic and social issues, and our political landscape is failing us. with the highest incarceration rate in the world, we struggle with crime, border issues, homelessness, and a lack of affordable housing—these are just a few of the problems we need to address.

our politicians, from the presidency to congress, seem stuck in a cycle of petty arguments that distract from real issues. rarely do they find common ground on anything meaningful, apart from rallying against other countries or pushing for misguided military engagements. this approach only adds to our challenges, causing more harm than good. it’s time for a change—one that fosters real solutions to the problems we face.

because the true problem with our nation is our inability to compromise with one another and push past our own wants and desires for the country and start pushing for the things that we really need",0

post_03389,"morning anxiety & throwing up. anyone else experience this? advice needed hi, i’m a 29(f) diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, unmedicated, i did take zoloft for a few years in my early 20s though. just some info for context.

okay here we go. my first memory of debilitating anxiety is from when i was 8 years old. i had a fear of throwing up (i don’t really have it anymore), so that’s how my anxiety would manifest. i would cough and cough till i eventually threw up. it would happen in the mornings before school. once i threw up, i was perfectly fine, and could go about my day. throughout my life i’ve gone through periods of remission...maybe 6 months at most? it was very bad in high school, almost every morning i threw up before school. when i took zoloft for a few years it still happened.

anyways, i’m in a very bad period again. it happened 3 days out of last week. i’m taking magnesium & ashwaganda the last few months at night, not helping. every morning as soon as i wake up the crippling anxiety hits. and i’m just paralyzed fighting the urge to throw up, it slows down my mornings i can’t get anything done. i’m getting so frustrated. it can take me an hour to get out of the house. i know anxiety and the digestive tract are linked, but i promise you it’s not my stomach causing the issues (i’ve had an endoscopy and colonoscopy). it is truly my brain working myself up to that point. 

does anyone have any recommendations of anything i can try or take or do? i’m desperate to feel like a normal human who can just wake up and get out of bed 😭. ",0

yesterday, he said if i ever needed him, to call him and he'll be here to hang out if i don't feel safe. i debated calling him for an hour after i attempted. when i finally did, he told me he'd eat and be right over. i was thinking just playing some video games would help take my mind off of things for a second.

  
he ended up taking 2.5 hours to get here, kept sending texts intermittently about how he was otw. when he came in he immediately told me he had to leave in a few. i didn't see how him being there for a few minutes would help, told him to go ahead and go finish his work, i know he has a lot to do, etc etc

it turned into him yelling at me.  i said i don't know why you're yelling at me when i'm doing what you told me to do if i didn't feel safe. i didn't mention the attempt because i knew he'd call the cops on me.

post_06779,"im done having sex with my gf m(24) f(25) 

we have sex 1-3 times a day every day. obviously some exceptions. and i have always been on the more wild side while she is more “vanilla” if you will. 

well i have been working on changing that for a while, taking my time and trying to talk it out. its been 6 months and there is 0 progress. she always says that next time but every time i try something new i get rejected. im not talking about anything crazy literally just initiating the act of changing position i get stopped. we do it strictly missionary only, all the time , every day.

normally i dont say anything until after were done so no one gets frustrated and i kill the mood even though it kind of does a little bit for me. but today we are on a trip in a nice hotel and we are getting it on and i pull her over to the edge and try to do her with me standing up (kind of missionary right?) and i get stopped, only this time i am like why ? it does not make sense ( to me ) and she just says “im going to have to make and effort with my legs” so that basically summed it up for me i think. she has no interest in doing anything but take it. im not a robot


im not a native english speaker so sorry if its weird.

edit: just wanted it to get it off my chest hence the sub and it was actually quite helpful was surprised about that

little more context 

the foreplay it consists mostly of kissing  and me doing the dirty talk which she encourages.

she doesnt want fingering she doesnt want me to go down on her and trust me im not being toxic as one person would suggest im a giver and while i bring it up occasionally i dont think im asking for much. i just want to feel that she wants me, with her body i mean she says it it just doesnt seem like it.

i dont think she is cheating we see each other a lot. hence the amount of time for sex we have.

i think we are just not compatible and thats fine, i can live with that. i just want her to be honest because it feels a little frustrating

edit : im a sex ofender now?

a couple more comments that may give some insight to how i feel

post_03750,"lowering hr?? well, pretty much what the title says.

  
i have always had a very mental reaction to my anxiety, not really physical symptoms that i can recall. recently i have had what i can only imagine as a full mental breakdown/spiral and it is like 'oops! all physical symptoms'. i can manage some, but the constant heart rate spike and 24/7 lightheaded/presyncope feeling is actually driving me insane and also heightening my health anxiety and general anxiety. 

i have been recently diagnosed with gad in therapy, but we haven't gone over coping mechanisms yet. thinking about starting lexapro. breathing exercises have done nothing for me, and despite a knowledge that it is my anxiety primarily causing it, it doesn't stop. i've had so many labs and a two day heart monitor which all showed up normal and fine, so i guess it's just confusing and scary. i walked to my job the other day and genuinely had to sit down for 10 minutes with my partner because i was so close to fainting. my job is 100% based on how fast i can walk, and i am starting to get complaints from my higher ups about how long it takes me to do things even after explaining it as a ""medical issue""-- they told me i have to bring them a doctors note which i am actively trying to get. 

anywho, does anyone have any advice on lowering heart rate? i'm talking like my heart rate can get up to like 150-170's ranges while simply walking. it's not good. anyway, thanks for reading if you read it.",0

post_05024,"i cannot get a girlfriend i meet girls, we date, nothing ever comes of it. i don't understand what i'm doing wrong. i'm just living my life, i workout, go to university,  do my sports and hobbies, meet up with friends. meet girls i like all the time. occasionally they like me back, we try it, then find out we have different values or just don't vibe that well. 

it seems like other guys all have long term girlfriends at regular intervals. the longest i've had was 6 months, and that was 1 year and a half ago. i've dated since then, nothing has come of it. i've tried not worrying about it, but i genuinely don't get what is wrong. could be that i'm not good looking, except the girls i have been involved with have said i am. so at least some girls think i am. could be that i've put on weight, but when i've mentioned that to others they say it's ridiculous because i look fine, which i do, but i still think i'm better looking when i lose weight, i'm skinny fat and there's a subtle difference in my facial structure when i am below 80kg compared to above 80kg. i notice it in photos. nobody else seems to agree though.

it just seems like i'm not meeting enough girls, but i don't see how i could meet more without being desperate. i already do everything normal people do in life. maybe there is just something about me that puts girls off. idk, people usually say i come accross very confident. i have loads of friends so it's not my social skills. i maybe am not the best at flirting, but do girls really care about that? i just try to vibe with them regardless.",0
post_06093,"my best friend is a child molester so my friend and i met in elementary school, we were close. as we got out of high school he joined the army and did his thing while i did mine but we kept in contact. after he left the military, i even drove 900 miles and picked him up from base. 

we lived together for a long time as roommates and just lived our life. played video games mostly, we were both kinda losers tbh lol.

a few years ago i was getting married and ultimately moved out and he was in a relationship with a girl and they moved in together. him and his girl got married and they had a son together last july. my wife and i had a daughter this past december. 

we hadn’t talked in a while. lives were just kinda going different directions and with kids it’s hard. i distanced myself from him just because he was still rather lazy and i just wanted to keep focused and not let that affect me.

his wife has 3 kids from before they got married. i found out he was caught in the act molesting their 11 year old. after that he barricaded himself in the garage with his gun before surrendering to the police. he is currently in custody with multiple felony charges, and i guess this had been going on for a while.

i knew this person better than anyone. i lived with him for years. if there was anyone on this earth i trusted it would be him. how does this happen?

i can’t wrap my head around it. what did i miss? i just feel after this like who can you trust? there was never an indication he had any issues whatsoever and that’s what kills me. how can people be so normal yet be so deranged and do these things. 

if anyone has any idea as to what goes on in the mind of the types of people it might help me get a better understanding of how the hell that happened. i am just so shocked and disgusted. thank you for hearing it out :)",0
post_02974,"does anyone have advice on how to overcome hell themed anxiety/ocd? 
for context, i'm not a religious person, but i do 100% believe in a god/higher power and an afterlife of some sort, most definitely. 

also, i cannot afford therapy right now, so any advice would be appreciated.

 i find myself in constant fear of an eternal hell, to the point where my brain cannot let it go, even when i try to distract myself by talking to family, playing games, going shopping, etc. the fear does not leave me, i never have peace of mind and i've been feeling like this for months.

now i know what happens after death is unknown and no one knows for sure, and i used to be content with that. i was always comfortable with death and nonchalant about it. even going as far as to say that i didn't fear death at all. (and damn, do i miss that feeling!) because there was no evidence of hell.

that was until i've read things about hellish ndes. now, i know there are christians out there who fabricate some of these stories to get people to convert out of fear, but i've read about them here on reddit, without the person having an agenda, they were just sharing their experience. and i know that the person can usually get out of it and that they usually turn positive, but those people weren't fully dead. who knows what happens when they don't come back.

i've even read scarier things here on reddit, about hellish deathbed visions, where people see demons and the devil and complain that they're burning and have a terrified look in their eyes. these scare me more than the ndes and only tells me that there's evidence of a hell and that i should live in fear.

i want to believe that these are hallucinations, but it's hard to, especially when i believe that the positive ones are real and that people's passed loved ones do come get them when they're on their death bed.

so, has anyone else dealt with this theme of anxiety/ocd and if so, how did you overcome it? i hate feeling and living like this. i just want to be comfortable with the unknown again and have my peace of mind back.",0

this is such a silly thing to be proud of, i know. but it's a big step for me. anxiety has ruined so much, but things like this make me realize that i've improved - no matter how little.

anyways, i guess this is what you'd consider a suicide note. tonight i am either going to suffocate myself, bleed out or simply get beheaded by a train, which is the last option as i hate to put all of that on innocent people, but i have a history of surviving the other stuff. i don't expect anyone to read it or care as i, as a person objectively do not matter much.

i originally wanted to write my entire story but i dont have the energy right now. my family will remember it anyway.

ever since my childhood i've wanted to leave this world. i cannot feel genuine happiness and i've done more harm then good. i was institutionalized mid 2024 and after i got out i got into a relationship with my girl best friend at the time, this was the only time i had felt hope in years. it all seemed to finally be going my way. sadly as i am bipolar and she is already traumatized by her past relationships she left after 3 months. she and my pets are really the only reasons why i am sorry for leaving. i cannot describe the amount of love i have for them and her. of course also my family, but they are adults and can live on their own. i know she's going through stuff, and all i want to do is to be there for her but she made it very clear that she doesn't want me to anymore. i will never be able to live knowing i will never see her smile again. anyways, this is it. i wanted to write something better but in the end neither my existence or passing make a difference. and to my angel, if for some reason you are reading this, it's not your fault. all you ever did was make my life better and if i hadn't met you i'd already be dead long ago. thank you for everything and i love you. please fight and find happiness for me my little girl ♥

post_02145,"the emergency room treats people with mental health issues like shit. i was admitted last night to the er for a suicide attempt. i was very upset and had multiple panick attacks.

i know i needed help. yet the doctor send me away. in the next hour i was rushed in by ambulance for a more serious attempt. which could have been avoided if the doctor actually would have listend to me. 

the attempt caused me to have surgery. note, i’m extremely anxious about anesthesia etc. so i tried to walk away, the nurses forced me back in bed. after a couple of minutes i tried to walk away again, this time they put me into seclusion. i told them i didn’t want to take off my pants because of a recent rape, they proceeded to push me to the ground and forced them of me. this made me have a severe panick attack. i was left alone.

after a while i got out of seclusion, still visibly upset. they wanted to put the saturation thiny on my finger but i didn’t give it straight away because i was wiping my tears. i got dragged to seclusion because of this. 

this morning i got the surgery, i tried to comply as much as possible. the surgery went well and i got into a recovery room. the doctor came and told me i was free to go. i told him i will try to kill myself again. he said that thats a risk he’s willing to take. 

right now i’m sitting on my bathroom floor in tears not knowing what i should do next.

post_05788,"terrified after first time sex so i (26m) finally had sex last night. and it was an effort that could have gone way better. i've been on a low calorie diet and reducing my carbs, which i think affect d my performance. i was struggling to stay hard and we tried a few times but i couldn't stay hard enough. foreplay was fine. however we eventually took a break, i (no joke) , ate a bunch of sugar in the hope it gave me energy, i think it did , and eventually lasted long enough to stay hard. i had prepared so much in advance and bought loads of condoms. i went through 5, 3 of which i gave up on because i couldn't put them on, one i used effectively and the final one was on my penis when i was about to penetrate. it fell off, and (mistake) i was so frustrated and embarrassed i carried on rather than put it back on (she didn't want me to use). i lasted a good 5 seconds before i got worried and then after some hand cajoling finished on her stomach. post-nut clarity hit and i'm now petrified i've made a big mistake due to the risk of having a child. whilst the 'main load' was external,im worried about any pre-load impact and i really really can't do with a baby right now. she said she will take the pill was reluctant and said she doesn't need to, as it's tough on the body. i empathised and also acknowledged that 9 months pregnancy is also pretty tough and a child is probably not a great idea for a ons. she agreed - she doesn't want a child, and said she will take the pill, but was frustrated. i offered to take her and pay for it but she wants to go herself as it takes so long. i'm hoping she does actually take it, but big mistake on my part: lesson learned that i should always put my own priorities first when it comes to h&s even when it feels awkward. her vagina smelt very fishy as well and i didn't even bother to have sex the next morning, i was so nauseous. there's a bunch more but that's the highlight. tldr : ons led to me accidentally having unprotected sex and now i'm scared that even though i pulled out that i've inadvertently messed my life up even more

post_01719,"“suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem” i hate sayings like this with all my heart. people who say these sort of phrases have no fucking idea what it’s like to be in severe pain. they have no clue whatsoever. they’re either not educated on cases where people are in severe pain and don’t respond to treatment or they just don’t believe it. they can’t believe life can be that bad that suicide is the only option. and it’s because they’re basing their views on their own experience. their own feelings and thoughts which aren’t the same as people contemplating suicide. 

if people who say these bullshit phrases could just take a step back and think about things logically. for example, a person posts that they are going to kill themselves. they have suffered in pain for years, they are damaged, they’ve tried countless treatments with no response and every day is filled with pain. without the fortune of not being in their shoes, can they not understand why suicide is a viable option? even if you can’t feel their pain, surely the facts can speak for themselves. you have to be a fucking idiot to read about a case like that and say to them “suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem” or “we have to play the cards we are dealt”. 

do they really think that the suicidal person( after years of pain) is going to think “this quote has changed my perspective entirely. i think i’m going to live now’”. whether the person intends to or not, sayings like this are patronising to people who have spent months or years weighing the options. i’m not saying they should just let them die if they’ve posted something like that. but patronising and bullshit quotes, when you can’t relate, just makes me pissed off. 

although it’s hard and the person just wants to post to let the pain out, they can’t without receiving responses that make them feel patronised and stupid. in general i just hate sayings and quotes. they shouldn’t be applied to be such a common thing that applies to everyone and every case. there’s no right way to respond to someone suicidal, but saying quotes is not the way. best way i can think of is just saying ‘i’m here if you need me for anything, if you want to talk”. i’m just a big believer in free will. no one should be confined to a life of pain.",1
post_01188,"my goodbye letter <3 hello :) 
i am 24f, from a small country in europe. i am writing this as i have no one to actually say goodbye to - maybe, just maybe someone will notice this so i can get a farewell. and if anyone is interested, i will talk a bit about myself, because all i wanted was for someone to care..

i want no one to be sad for me, i am going content knowing i actually gave life a shot and tried my best! but i know this is the best solution :( life is not meant for everyone and that is okay. 

ever since i was little i had no other purpose than to be mercilessly abused by my teachers and peers and neglected by my parents (i believe they did not mean to, so i have no hard feelings though). 
i was treated as if i was less than human. if something in the class broke, they all agreed to blame it on me. if someone didn’t wipe the board that day, they’d say i was on duty so i’d be the one punished. they’d also beat me with a chair, push me down the stairs, throw my pencils out the window, step on my clothes so they’d be dirty, throw food in my face… you get the idea. at some point kids said if you touched me, you’d get a virus that made you as stupid and ugly as i was so no one wanted to sit next to me. i get really sad when i see younger pictures of myself :( she was a sweet girl and she didnt deserve that. every day was like walking on the battlefield, i would pray to god to take me away but he didn’t want to. i was 11 at most :( my only relief was art, anime, video games and such. up until 15 i only had online friends on an internet forum back then, and they helped me with loneliness. 

high school was a bit better but i ended up really depressed and spent it battling an eating disorder and not living my years unlike my peers :( my parents didnt notice i was struggling even though i was losing so much weight, they were too attentive to my little brother that had some issues so he needed more help and attention which i understood. but i was left to battle everything alone with no support :( i developed depression, sh issues and an ed. i went to therapy but didn’t help much :( 

right now i’m working with kids, they are cute and i love them but my workplace is really abusive and it brought me to a new low :( it’s well paid but that doesn’t help me much. i dread everyday just like i did when i was a kid. i am just living the same sh’t again and again and cannot change anything. i know if i keep on living it will just be more and more abuse as this is why i was born :( i don’t know anything else but this. 

love of my life left me a while ago and he is much better without me. im too broken to love and be loved. (d, if u ever read this know that i loved u from the bottom of my heart. i am sorry i was not a better gf for you.)

sadly i cannot feel anything anymore but despair and hopelessness. i left behind all my dreams of being an artist or a sports teacher or a trainer (i really love working out) sadly i chose psychology to study and i cannot change it anymore nor study something else :( i don’t even have the energy left anymore anyway. 

i really hope my parents will take care of my cats, two strays i saved and raised from since they were the size of my palm. maxine and sissi, you kept me alive for a little more and you are the light of my life 🤍 i will remember your shiny, emerald eyes, your soft fur, and you purring on my chest as i pass away. 

i had so much love to give sadly i didn’t know how to give and receive , and i am also really scared of people deep down :( i dont know how to fit in and never knew. i tried to change my life inside and outside, i really tried it all. but now my soul is really worn out :( 
i would like to thank everyone who kept me alive for a little longer, anyone who ever tried even in the slightest to encourage me, and saw even the littlest potential in me. 
i am sorry i bit like a scared dog the hands of people who tried to help because i couldn’t distinguish anymore who was and who wasn’t well-meaning. i am so sorry :( i have many regrets in this life too, all them being i wasn’t a better person to the very little people who loved me. in my last moments, i hope they can forgive me and visit my grave or think about me from time to time. i am sending everyone so much love and gratitude, it was a difficult journey and a really painful one too. i think my soul has learned a lot in this painful lifetime. but it is enough. 

mom, dad, i love you. i forgive you for not being there for me. i hope you can forgive me too. my dear cats, i love you. my beloved ex bf, i forgive you for leaving and i’ll always love you. the friends i had and left, i’ll cherish the memories. and everyone who took their time to read until the end, thank you! goodbye everyone!

post_07392,"struggling to keep going lately, everything feels like it's crashing down around me. the weight of my traumas and anxieties is suffocating. i feel like i'm drowning in a sea of hopelessness, with no lifeline in sight. each day is a battle to keep going, to put on a brave face when all i want to do is disappear.  i try so hard to make things work, to push through the pain and the loneliness, but it feels like i'm stuck in quicksand, sinking deeper with each passing moment. the thought of ending it all has crossed my mind more times than i can count. the idea of escaping this never-ending cycle of despair is both terrifying and strangely comforting.  i feel like a burden to those around me, like i'm dragging them down with my own struggles. it's hard to see a future when the present feels so unbearable. i long for the peace that comes with the end, the quiet that follows the storm.  therapy helps, but even that feels like a fragile lifeline that could snap at any moment. i fear that i'm running out of options, out of reasons to keep fighting. the world keeps spinning, but i feel stuck in place, unable to move forward.  i don't know how much longer i can keep pretending that everything is okay. the facade is cracking, and the darkness is seeping in. i just want the pain to end, to find some kind",1
post_07432,"struggling to find hope lately, it feels like the weight of the world is crushing me. i wake up every morning with a heaviness in my chest that never seems to go away. the thoughts of ending it all have been lingering in my mind, whispering that maybe it's the only way out of this endless darkness. i've tried reaching out to friends and family, but no one seems to understand the depth of my pain. loneliness has become my constant companion, and the idea of facing another day feels unbearable.  i'm drowning in a sea of despair, and i can't see a way out. every day is a battle to just keep breathing, to keep going through the motions when all i want to do is give up. the future looks bleak, and the past is filled with regrets and sorrows that haunt me in the silence of the night.  i don't know how much longer i can hold on. the thought of relief that comes with the idea of ending it all is tempting, but a part of me still holds onto a flicker of hope that maybe, just maybe, things can get better. but right now, in this moment, it feels like that hope is slipping through my fingers. i'm lost, i'm broken, and i don't know how to find my way back.",1

post_05525,"having severe mental health issues sucks, and knowing that things won't improve until i see a new psychiatrist just makes things so much worse. i hate every second my day-to-day life right now. i hate how i can't keep a stable sleep schedule, even when i can sleep. i hate how i can't focus, or be mentally organized. i hate how i can't take a shower or brush my teeth every day; how i can't write fiction or learn to drive; how everyone i know essentially sees me as an accessory to my fiancé, because i don't have my own social life.

my whole life is just on hold. it's been that way for a long time. 6 years ago, i was double majoring in neuroscience and psychology, ran a club that rose awareness about mental health issues and resources, and wrote fiction well enough that a literary editor called my work groundbreaking. then my meds for depression stopped working, i developed ptsd, and i've been trying to get back to being a functional adult ever since. getting diagnosed with ptsd and (severe) adhd a few years ago was a really big deal for me, but it still feels like every time i take a step forward, i get a new roadblock slammed in front of me. 

in march, i finally stopped experiencing constant issues with dissociation and flashbacks. ever since then, i've been trying to get my adhd and insomnia under control, because it's kind of pointless to be on meds that help you focus when you're unable to function at all for other reasons. but i keep hitting issues with bullshit technicalities, and now with some luck it'll be only 5-6 weeks until i can try the meds that i need to... well, try next. i have to get a new psychiatrist, which means getting a new pcp because of insurance weirdness, which means rearranging all of my health care, but the real frustrating part is just being stuck *like this* for so much longer. knowing that nothing is going to even have the chance to improve for that much longer. 

all i can do is rot in front of the tv, and i fucking hate it. it's just that if you can't focus, and you can't stay organized, and you can't keep stable routines, and you can't sleep, and you're depressed on top of all that, you can't really do *anything*. so i have all the time in the world to think about how frustrated i am, and how pointless my life is right now. 

i want to be able to drive, so i can go to a zen temple and meetup groups and build an actual social life. i want to be able to write and study fiction every day, so that i can make money writing erotica in the short term and build a career as a speculative fiction novelist in the long term. i want to get physically fit, and go back to school, and do all sorts of things that i can't do right now. but i'd settle for step one, which is being able to rely on myself and keep stable routines. why is having the basic ability to function that most people just *have* so much to fucking ask for? or the basic combination of medications that i want to be on, which are commonly prescribed for people with my psychiatric comorbidities?

every time i mention my psych issues on here, someone mentions meditation or exercise or something, so i'll just pre-emptively say: i've already tried every therapy tool and lifestyle change that i'm capable of doing. medication is a tool, not a shortcut, and sometimes it's necessary. i didn't pay $800 out of pocket to do cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia because my real problem is commitment.

post_06112,"i (f26) cheated on my boyfriend with the stripper he was seeing almost daily and i’m glad i did it. throwaway, absolutely.

it was the best decision i ever made. my now ex-boyfriend was emotionally and verbally abusive. he’d call me derogatory names when i didn’t do something he wanted and he’d make hurtful comments about my body. i’m not even overweight but i have body dysphoria.  i was crying every single day. i wanted to leave him but i couldn’t because i was emotionally dependent on him for everything and we were living together. he started going to strip clubs and being open with me about and telling me he enjoys seeing women that look better than me. he went so often that i felt like he was cheating on me. i just had to go for myself and see what it was like.

one night i went and decided to pay for a dance. it just so happens the i got a dance from one of the strippers he sees. little did i know meeting her was going to be the best thing that ever happened to me. i was a bit drunk and tipsy so i over shared with her about my bf and told her about him. she said she knew who i was talking about because he’d always talk badly about me to the dancers. i just broke down and cried right there like a big idiot in front of her. she gave me a tissue to wipe my tears and gave me a huge hug. she said she didn’t know what my bf was talking about because she thought i was beautiful. it made me cry even more because it made my day for a girl to think i’m pretty at least. 

i kept going every so often then eventually we exchanged numbers and started going out. i was so surprised to see she dressed like a boy when she wasn’t working and to learn that she was gay. she told me she doesn’t like men at all but she makes good money off of them. people really surprise me a lot. she had/has the cutest personality ever. she opens doors for me and would ask me if i was tired or if i had anything to eat. i realized i was attracted to her and she was attracted to me. this kept going on for a few months.  one night she kissed me and told me to leave him and to move in with her. we had sex and she made me look at myself in the mirror and tell myself i’m beautiful. i thought it was time to leave him because at that point i realized i deserved better than to be emotionally, mentally and verbally abused almost everyday by someone i used to love.

while he was at work she helped me pack up everything. i sent him a text detailing why i was leaving him. i changed my number and blocked him on everything. i live with her far away from him and haven’t heard from him in months and honestly i’m glad.  

i don’t care about your opinions on my cheating on my abusive boyfriend. i have no regrets. if i never cheated on him i would’ve never found the power to leave his toxic and abusive ass and be with a girl who loves all of me and makes me feel so beautiful. 

we’ve been together for six months and i’m still so in love with her. she’s still the same loving and sweet person she was when i first met her. and she’s amazing in bed, like full blown amazing. she makes me cum all the time and he hardly ever did. maybe only once a month if i’m being honest. she works at a different strip club now and i found a new job i’m starting soon and i’m so excited for new shit to come my way. i feel so blessed and lucky.

happy valentine’s day everyone :) if you don’t have a valentine it doesn’t matter just love yourself ❤️


edit: ok so i didn’t “just go lesbian”.  bisexuality exists for all you ignorant assholes commenting about my sexuality. 

i don’t care if you think my experience was “fake” or not. bottom line is i’m in a happy relationship.

thanks everybody for the awards and the kind comments! :) holy shit this really blew up

edit 2: lots of comments asking if they see each other at the club. i already stated my gf works at a different club now so no they don’t!


edit 3: i didn’t expect this to blow up as much as it did! holy crap thank you all so much from the bottom of my happy heart ♥️ 🥰😘",0

post_00434,"struggling i’m not here to say i’m going to or even considering, i’m just here to vent for a moment because everything going on in my life has kept me struggling with suicidal thoughts and i think getting it out will prove helpful. my wife early in our relationship went on a date with her ex and lied about it and tries to tell me there was nothing wrong with it. i spent most of my savings getting her out of debt and helping her move forward with her life. she doesn’t plan to reimburse me in any way. i’ve worked at my job for 10 years and most people make 100k a year in this field by that time, but i’m barely making half that. the worst part is i don’t even like it and i never have, i just don’t think i’m good enough to go anywhere else. i take care of all the holiday presents for everyone with no thanks, i’m $13,000 in debt living pay check to pay check trying to figure out how to get a house and 2 new cars while our apartment sucks and our cars are running on fumes. my family can barely tolerate me and i can’t stand how they child me around. my brother has never been there for me, no matter how much i try to be there for him. my friends make me the butt of the joke, yet i still smile and laugh because if i didn’t i probably wouldn’t have them. one even was my roommate and screwed me out of thousands of dollars. my only passion is music and i can’t do it because i not only don’t have the space/room/money, but anytime i try to use my equipment my wife won’t stay quiet for me. my wife’s parents are in a ton of debt and it scares me that one day all of that will end up on us, which just means i have to take care of it. and no matter what, i always feel like i can never satisfy anyone. i will never be good enough. i say i love god, and i believe in god, but i barely pray and i’m scared i’ll end up going to hell. i can’t put the bottle down anymore, because when i do i start loathing in regret and anxiety. i just can’t take it. but even after all of that, i’ll be ok. i’ll figure it out. i’ll suck it up and become stronger. i’ll kick some ass one way or another. i’m better than my circumstances and the only person i can truly satisfy at the end of the day is myself and i will continue on that path.",1

post_03701,"away from home. 
don’t know where else to post this but i kinda need some help. im 24f my husband and i have just had our 1st year anniversary as husband and wife and it also marks one year of living together.

 because of my husband’s job he works construction and the company he works for moves all over the us. we moved like 20 something hours away from home. we moved from california to taxes. we have also moved to other place like to montana and arizona and the first day or even the second i would be anxious and nervous for no reason and then it would go away after the first two days i would be fine. but this time i have been dealing with really bad anxiety attacks and i don’t know what do to anymore it’s been a 2 weeks now and i don’t feel any better. 

the time difference isn’t helping i usually get anxiety attacks in the mornings and we are 2 hours ahead from everyone back home.  i usually call my mom or my sister when i have anxiety attacks. but it’s not like i can call them while i’m breaking down while i make lunch and breakfast for my husband it’s way too early to wake anyone up with my problems.. 

my husband didn’t really believed  that anxiety was a thing  until now he is starting to get worried because he has never seen me have anxiety attack before and now it’s like i’m getting them once or even twice everyday. i usually have them under control before he gets home. 

my anxiety attacks consist or crying, pacing or feeling stomach pains and nausea and feeling like my heart is thumping really loud that i feel as if it was beating throughout my body. and sometimes it’s all of that together. 

i’m so tired i just want to go back to how i was before. any advice of how to deal with this.

i am crying right now as i type this (yay for postpartum hormones) but i can’t believe that we can actually afford to have one of us stay home! we had talked about it before conceiving but now it is our reality. 

i just feel very grateful and i wanted to tell someone. my parents are traditional so i don’t really feel like talking to them about it as they think my husband should be the “breadwinner.” but i actually like my job and it’s much more important to me that my daughter is with her dad every day than my husband and i following social norms to keep my family comfortable.

i just think that this is an amazing opportunity and i don’t want it ruined yet with negative remarks from my parents so i turned to reddit to celebrate 😆 thanks for reading!

thank you all so much for the love! for real though! and for those with negative comments, that’s fine too! your total strangers and we are never crossing paths irl so it’s no biggie.

i really did not expect this to blow up as much as it did. i was up early nursing and feeling all emotional and happy and wanted to talk about it. i’m so grateful to read the comments of those who were/who were married to/and who were the kids of a stay at home dad. they made me so excited for our future.

post_00571,"i just need to get this all off my chest i think i'll die in the next 6 months. 

i'm 25 years old. i've been telling myself i'll die at this age since i was 17. 

i didn't expect this year to be so fucking awful. 


i'm heavily estranged from my mom's family. they. fucking. hate me. (i'm queer they are deeply christian republican) i'm not close with my mom. we got estranged when i was a teenager and my parents were divorcing and she was - not in a good place. but she connected with these girls from a girls home when i was a teenager and idk- they kinda took my place in her life. it's w/e. they need her more. 

i was always closer to my dads family especially his parents but they both died of cancer late last year. within a few months of losing both of them my senior cat passed away real suddenly. it just felt like too much loss. 

i had this job as a baker that i really loved. i loved my coworkers and the work i did and my hours and my pay was good. and then corporate laid off the entire position. and then i was jobless for a while and theny wife convinced me to get this back of house job with her. and i fucking hate it. i hate it so much. i don't want this job. i fucking hate it there i hate it so much it's so draining and fast paced and miserable and i've barely worked there. 

i don't wanna get too into politics here but the state of things, and the way everyone talks online, and the fact my whole family supports this stuff its all so disgusting and i feel so fucking hopeless and doomed. 

the two people worth holding on for are my dad and wife. my dad still talks to me which isn't something anyone in my family can really say aside from him. my wife would be so crushed if i did it. i know they would feel so guilty. 

but things with my wife and i get complicated and i'm deeply insecure and always worried that we aren't compatible and that shes wasting her time on me and i'm not good enough for her. or i'm worried that she's fed up with dealing with me. i think she knows im depressed and getting suicidal again. i think it kinda annoys her most of the time. i feel of really low value as a partner. hell i fell of incredibly low value as a person. 

i don't have any fucking friends. i have like 3 ppl i talk to every few months and i've never met any of them irl.  i have no fucking friends at all. 


i've always wanted to create. writing or art or whatever. i've put in years of practice but never really developed the skill. i've never been particularly talented. i don't have an enjoyable personality. and i'm not smart so i don't really bring anything to societies table. no one cares. no one's looking. no one gaf if i die.  except ig my dad and my spouse. 

i don't wanna life some worthless miserable life where i do nothing but work miserable fucking jobs that doesn't even offer breaks, for companies that wouldnt gaf if i was hit by a train. i don't wanna spend the little time i have to myself too tired and drained to do anything i enjoy. i don't wanna spend the rest of my miserable fucking life like that. fuck that. if i die i don't have to. my dad and wife will have to understand that right? 

there's no way i get to live and not submit to that horrible awful fucking lifestyle. i can't do it i don't want to. i can't even get a job outside of food service because i shoplifted when i was 21 and now i have a criminal record and no where will hire me. and i don't have the money to get it off my record because i don't make enough to afford it and the constantly climbing bills, and grocery costs, and everything else that just demands more and more and more just to stay alive. they'll take away retirement and have us working 12 hours shifts 7 days a week before i even get to 50. i can't live like that.

ever since i was little i had been bullied for the way i look, i’ve already struggled with weight gain and it took a toll on me. i had such bad self doubt at such a young age it concerned my parents but i lied about being okay. once i started getting older i learned that i need to hide my emotions from people by stuffing it deep down and detracting myself by playing sports and cooking. but the bulling didn’t stop and it’s to the point where i don’t eat anymore, and throwing up. but the bulling didn’t stop. i hate the way i look so much i’ve just stopped talking to people or even going out. i cry myself to sleep almost every night. i just don’t know what to do anymore, i just want to feel love. i just want someone i can talk to and tell them i love them, i want to be able to treat a girl how i’ve always wanted to be treated.i don’t know what to do anymore",0

post_02818,"today i realized that i'm probably going to actually commit suicide sometime in my life. it may not be today, tomorrow, or even 10 years from now, but i honestly think there's a 90% chance that the way i will end up dying is by killing myself. i've struggled with depression since i was 14. i've been making significant progress in therapy and i am the happiest i've ever been. but somehow i keep ensing up depressed and coming back to these thoughts.

i have a fear of being elderly and alone. i am divorced, don't have kids, and don't have many friends. i'm afraid of living in an old folks home and just being forgotten about. and then today i realized that i pretty much already am forgotten about. i moved across the country a couple years ago, none of my family or friends ever call me. my mom never calls, my sister doesn't call. the only time my best friwnd messages me is to complain about her life. she never asks me how i'm doing or what's going on with me. i'm always the one calling them, and if i don't we simply don't talk. it's like my fear of being alone has come true, the only difference is i'm younger and able to take care of myself still. i do have an amazing boyfriend, but lately i keep screwing shit up so i wouldn't doubt it if he left me soon too.

so ya. it may not be today or tomorrow, it might even be 10 or 20 years from now. but unless i have an accident of some sort this will probably be how i die.

edit: wow i can't believe how many people have the same thoughts and feel the same way. i'll try to reply when i can. it's comforting to know we're in this together. thanks for the encouragement everyone. it actually brightened my day a little. and please please don't hurt urselves. one thing that has made a huge difference so far for me is emdr therapy. i've tried all kinds and that one has helped the most. i still do have suicidal thoughts, but they aren't as often as they used to be, so that's good i guess. consider looking into it?",1

i neglect my responsibilities. i don't do things that i have a deadline for, because i'm busy watching porn. i don't talk to my friends or family that much, because i'm busy watching porn. i don't workout anywhere near as much as i used to, because i'm busy watching porn. i don't do the things that i used to love doing, because i'm busy watching porn.

my fetishes get steadily more and more depraved. when i was a kid, i used to watch softcore, vanilla stuff. now, i watch things that i legitimately cannot say. it makes me hate myself so fucking much. whenever i finish, i feel like driving a knife in my aorta, or slitting my throat.

the absolute worst part of it all is that nobody believes this is a real addiction. tell a person that you're addicted to alcohol, and they'll believe you. you have a heroin addiction? oh, you poor soul! we can help you with that. but if you say: ""i have a porn addiction"", people'll tell you that it isn't real. sure. it's not real. i want to kill myself for no fucking reason.

there is this guy in my friend group l (24m) that i feel deep affection towards, but i have no idea if it's just down to him being my favourite person (i have bpd), romantic love, or both.

  
he recently got out of a toxic relationship and said he's not interested in romantic relationships, but then he's flirted with me before? my friend h (19f) said he's a really affectionate person when i asked her if he really was or not. additionally, he has also called me ""sena"", his favourite character he self-ships with and says he's married to.



what confuses me even more is he said he has a crush on n (18m), but i don't know if he was joking/i misheard him or not because his mic isn't very good and he said it in vc. additionally, n was 17 when he first met l and i don't think l knew this until the other day when n said he's 18.

  
i've always disliked n even before joining this friend group and finding out he has a crush on l, but i'm not sure why i dislike him. when n openly flirted with l yesterday i didn't feel anything which is why i'm confused about my feelings. i have tried to force myself to like n so i don't divide the friendship group, especially after the other day when he took part in appreciating me after i had a breakdown (l kept messaging me through it and trying to support me. he was also the one that started the appreciation towards me)

  
i have no idea if my feelings are a mess because it truly is romantic love or if it's related to past trauma that makes me want to cling onto him and make sure he doesn't leave no matter what. it has been way too much to handle and has only gotten worse over the past few days to the point where i've started trying to avoid my friend group because it's that painful.

i really don't want to cause drama and i wouldnt want to make any moves on l if it was romantic love because of how recent that breakup was and how toxic that relationship was",0

i am a topper , my dad doesn't like anything below 95  .my grades decreased a lot in last test, this only happened because of bio , i hate bio , i never wanted to study it but he does. my grades decreased a lot in last test. he wasn't happy about it of course , he punished me , took my phone and told me to study.

but stupid me instead decided to register for free online therapy , i got to know about it because of post i made and a wonderful kind woman messaged me , to tell me about this free therapy website.  so while registering i very foolishly gave my old email id which was registered in my phone , he saw that.

he entered my room , i quickly changed the tab on my laptop to study material. he asked me what i am doing calmly , i said i am studying , he checked my laptop before i can do anything , my history is already closed but i hadn't closed the tab completely , just changed it so he saw it.

he started beating me . he said , ''this is not because you were seeking therapy but because you lied , god knows how many times you have lied about studying and wasted time instead , i hate lying and that's why your marks are decreasing as well. and what was the need to lie ? if you would have just told me i would have taken you to fucking therapist for whatever you need''  he was already so mad at me because of my marks , then i lied and mom wasn't home to stop too this time. so he didn't stop until i bleed. ....my jaw hurts a bit...and my stomach pains...my hands are shaking a bit...now i am writing an leave application for school , cause i can't go looking like this for couple of days. my dad never wanted a girl... i wish i was a boy.

i know i did many mistakes l things...(very glad he still doesn't know that) but still i am looking for sympathy i guess? lol

posting or whatever isn't going to help but..idk , i just don't have anyone to tell this to since i stopped talking to...people as everyone suggested in last post , he did took away my laptop too. this is phone they don't know of.....gifted by someone. i am such a master mind when it comes to hiding still i messed up today...

post_06448,"parents, please don't force your kids to go to university if they haven't yet decided on what they want to study. seriously, it's a huge waste of money and precious time. a university degree isn't free despite what any short-term thinking will lead you to believe. you're paying that loan back. the likelihood is your kid will just about scrape through if they're lucky meanwhile dreading every day they spend in lectures looking for other ways to stimulate themselves. 

i understand and agree with the mindset ""knowledge is power"" and the doors a degree holder has access too, that said not going to university straight out the gate at 18 doesn't mean you're condemned to working a minimum wage job or job surfing for the rest of your life. please educate yourself before spouting this lie to your children. that narrow mindset is toxic and breeds fear in your child leading them to feel panicked into making any decision. the world has never been black or white, university or bust. 

at 18 there's time for exploring who you actually are post the mandatory peer pressure you get in high school. what things you naturally or eventually gravitate towards. there is no ""time limit"" for this feeling process. you'll know when you're ready. the desire will spark to lap up whatever information offered about whatever industry you wish to pursue. if it never comes and you find a straight path into your desired industry and you wish to go that route that's totally okay too. or if you don't want to go to university at all that's also fine but it's wise to have a plan of action in place. with those who go later on, theres a massive upside of intentionally going to university with your heart set on a particular industry. there won't be any ""going with the motions"". every opportunity to learn more is exciting. they will succeed. 

in the meantime parents, if they're going to be living under your roof or alone for that matter of course i'd encourage them to get a job. if they have a specific job related to a potential degree great, if not anything will do. being non productive at home isn't going to move anyone forward. 

the way i view it is to make university work in your childs favour. don't allow them to get pimped by it. getting a degree they hate for an industry they don't wish to work in only to go back later or bite the bullet and stick it out isn't smart living. if you have the opportunity to plan ahead wisely why not take it and reap the benefits later when your child is doing what they set out to and feeling satisfied and happy during the process. 

actually have dialogue with your kids and please listen to them instead of shoving your dreams for them down their throats.",0

well today when i left the counselling session, i hopped on the bus home and i passed a local pub, in a split second i made the decision to get off the bus and go in for some food. i had the sweatiest palms in all of ireland going in, and i was also put at a very central table which made me feel like i was center of attention, in a bad way.

i can’t help but feel a little resentful towards men sometimes. i love my job and i also have a side hustle too. both of these are on hold so i can take care of our baby. everything has changed for me - my body, my confidence, my finances, my freedom, my identity. i just feel like none of this happens to a man. sure, the good dads are hands on and i love that so much. but i feel like men just get to carry on with their lives as they did before, while we’re slowly drowning in this new life. 

are these feelings normal? am i still depressed? is there anything i can do to help manage these emotions?",0
post_00057,"vent now that i look back at our old texts during those few days we were together, i think i understand why we weren’t meant to be. even if he did like me back then, i probably ruined it by how clingy i was, i sounded so fucking cringy and i honestly can’t blame him.

but god. it still hurts. sure, even if all i said was truth, even if im right, that just hurts more the fact that he hated the side of me that was clingy. i wish i could go back and stop myself from saying all those stupid things.

january hasn’t been nice to me at all. constant arguments with my parents and them arguing, constant doubt of myself. i don’t think i really wanted to get back with him. i just really fucking needed somebody to say they loved me for the mess that i am. 

i really wish i wasn’t this stupid. i’m old enough to not say , think such stupid things. i feel so numb. i wish i didn’t feel like this. i wish i was somebody’s first priority. i wish i was cared about. i wish my friends would choose me in a room full of people. i wish *he* could choose me like before. i hate how he was the last straw. the breaking point of all this. 

i can’t believe throughout this upset feeling i’ve developed over summer finally broke during january after i told him how i felt. and now, now i’m just numb. before january at least some things still interested me, some things still kept me going, i still had some hobbies, but now. nothing matters to me, not friends, not him, not nothing. i just wish i could pass on peacefully in my sleep. it all feels so pointless. school feels pointless. the music, the videos, nothing entertains me anymore, i just feel like i’m in a loop. worst thing is, it’s nobody’s fault. it’s not his fault for being an apathetic person, it’s not his fault that he doesn’t know how to communicate well, it’s not even my fault yet i hate myself for still loving him. for still caring. 

i know this is all stupid, going this far for a guy. but even i don’t know why he was the breaking point for me. maybe it was because he’s the first person to ever care about me. maybe it’s because i’m stupid, i hate how much i care still. i hate january and if im being honest. i don’t wanna keep going. i know i can continue but honestly what’s the point, sure i’ll get over him but life is so dull now. it was before i asked him but now, now it’s even more dull. i don’t even have a reason to be here anymore. i don’t know anymore. i just. i hope i can disappear.",0
post_04444,"for whoever needs to hear this, it will be okay. for anyone who needs to hear this, it will be okay. whatever you are fearing right now will pass, just like everything you've feared in the past worked itself out on its own. things may not go the way you expect them, and that's okay. that's the way life is for everyone. but everything will work itself out in the end. you will find a job, you will get that degree, you will find love, you will be successful, the terrible thing you are worried about will probably not happen, and even if something unexpected does occur you are 100% strong enough to get through it. you are stronger than you think and you will be okay. there is nothing wrong with you. you are not weird or a loser or a stereotype. you are not ugly or bad or defective. you are so much more. you are a flawed but beautiful human soul who is  so much more valuable and complex than anyone around you could ever comprehend. you are okay and you are going to be okay.",0
post_04634,"if you are browsing and read this please take a moment and do this...  a moment to breathe. take a minute and:
- stretch your back
- get your shoulders back
- unclench your jaw (important one - thank you u/saltedbiscuittv)
- relax your muscles and let your body feel its own weight
- wherever you are, imagine that your scenario is imaginary; you are alone and all noise or people are a sort of movie playing around you
- close your eyes (really, just do it)
- imagine you are in your safest place on earth (your bedroom, an island, near the sea...) -- you should do this as a sort of meditation technique, be careful with dissociation symptoms (i suffer from it but it helps to remove myself from the place i am so you do you!) - thanks to u/veraamber
- inhale deeply and hold it for a couple seconds
- exhale as slow as possible...
- repeat 5 or 10 times
- remember that right at this moment there are thousands of people feeling the same exact thing you are now feeling; you are not alone, think about it and feel that connection

later:
- go on about your day and put the phone down when you can and if possible do something nice that calms you down later - you deserve it! go for an icecream, snuggle in a nice blanket... 

- if you’re not alone let people know you need a break to feel better, it’s a great first step if you are ashamed of your anxiety or try to hide it

- when you have time, write down in a really small font size a list of things that make you feel calmer or relaxed (reading, music, whatever) - print it and put it in your wallet or anything you carry around because most of the time we just forget to do those things! 

when you feel overwhelmed, read the list and choose an item and do it. it’s easy for us to fall in the trap of “freezing” and never do the things that we *know* calm us down. i have mine with a list of good things in life/things i enjoy doing/reminders that i’ve struggled for years and... i’m still here!

have a good morning/afternoon/night, you are never alone <3

edit #1: added one more step thanks to u/saltedbiscuittv
edit #2: thanks to u/veraamber for the reminder on ""imagining you're elsewhere"" might be harmful to some people
edit #3: as i am still in a very agitated mood and my legs are sore from all the stress i just realized... first silver thingy on here x2! it feels amazing that venting while i was having a hard time helped someone out - thank you! :')

post_04625,"i (41m) stood up for myself in a relationship for the first time in my life. it cost the relationship but i feel great about valuing my needs. use meds if you can people. i wish i started sooner. she told me kissing me wasn't worth it. she said she won't be able to give me a family i wanted so what's the point. she could have been discussing the weather. 

she then in the same breath asked me to help her with a presentation. 

she is a doctor. makes 4 times more then i do. she is accustomed to getting her way. saying things without consequences. 

not this time. not with me. 

 i stood up. told her she needs to reevaluate her wants in life and i'm going to give her her space. 

i left. she messaged me. she wanted me to go on a trip with her. she said she was willing to pay.

 i asked her ""what's the point?"". 

before meds i would have been at her beck and call. i would have been in shambles. i would have given her opportunities time and time again. 

i will miss her mother. i will miss her dogs. i won't miss being treated that way. i am saddened that i'm alone again. but i'm effin proud that i drew my line in the sand and refused to budge. 

if you have the opportunity to seek help, use meds etc please do so. the power and self worth that comes with less anxiety is amazing.

post_04957,"my (29f) married friend (26m) told me “i love you” in a friendly way for the 1st time and i keep thinking about it we were out as a group at a bar. i know this friend values my friendship since we have similar backgrounds. and i know it was friendly. but why can’t i stop thinking about it, i hate myself for even ruminating on this. 

at some point in the night my friend says my name to me while tilting his head and putting his hands up (he used to do this many years back and now only does this rarely). he put one hand on my shoulder and said “i love you” “thanks for coming tonight” “i want us all to hangout when we’re older”. i replied “i know you do, i hope we do too” then he repeated “i love you” again and another “thanks for coming”. i replied “i love you too, i hope we do too” and we hugged very fast. i could barely look him in the face during the exchange. i was scared anything could happen and i from the corner of my eye saw his wife stay at the exit door and watch the exchange. i didn’t go to the next bar but went home. 

i felt like the exchange opened up a repressed can of worms for me. when i’d gotten married many years ago (now single) he sort of stopped talking to me for ~2 years. he later came around but i didn’t realize that until after. he sometimes looks at my face while i’m not looking. i know i’m fairly attractive so it’s just an appreciation of beauty but he did that that night too so it added to how i’m thinking about this now. 

am i overthinking this? i do believe male and female friends should be able to tell each other i love you. but i think here it’s bc i know i’ve had feelings in the past he’s not aware of. id like to think i’m self aware so i do think i may be creating something from nothing. ive went low contact with the friend group for me feeling like this.

edit: thanks for the well wishes to those who offered them, im going to get some comfort food and a beer or two and try to enjoy my night. i have family visiting soon so i’m just trying to look forward to that

also to add: a lot of people are saying have a chat with her, i plan on it to discuss boundaries and such. i just know if i did the same thing she would be super upset, so i’m not going to fight fire with fire. give respect - get respect.

last edit: we did have a little chat and it went well. she apologized sincerely for not being quieter and explained how she completely understands why it would be upsetting, and that she would be upset if the roles were reversed.  we talked about how this is a tricky situation, boundaries, and how to move forward with being respectful to each other while still having our own privacy and things of that sort. we are going to talk about possibly moving into different apartments if we can both afford to do so. thanks again for everyone’s kind words and advice. hopefully we can move past this and continue to co-exist with civility and respect for each other.",0
post_06301,"we gave my friend $1000 dollars. and i don't want to tell anyone else. she cried, sobbed, and thanked us profusely.

she's working a shitty job. doesn't have a place of her own. and her car broke down after just getting it financed a month ago. she has 2 kids that she can't have custody of due to lack of her own housing.

&#x200b;

she's sweet. wonderful. loving. caring. and deserving of so much more than what life has given her.

we used to be in that position. my wife and i shared a car for a year or two. it was shitty and run down. i got a flat in it once and turned the nut/bolt/whatever to release the spare and instead it ripped out the bottom of the trunk. 

&#x200b;

it's expensive being poor. i can buy bulk now. i can afford higher quality items that don't break/stop working after a year or two. 

&#x200b;

when i asked for help from my family... specifically because we were being kicked out of our rental, all i got was a listing for auction houses. after all they did to help my brother throughout his life and many mistakes, i got a website for auctions. my wife's family had no money, save her grandfather, who was kind enough to loan us money without interest, which we paid back. 

&#x200b;

i remember how much we needed just $1000. that was a lot of money. ***a lot of money***. i remember. 

&#x200b;

so we helped. and she told us that she was so worried that the apartments would call and she'd have nothing for the security deposit and her chance would be gone. 

that weight and worry was lifted off of her.

post_06843,"my fiancé died today. i’m so angry. he was shot three times at close range. he was making a marijuana deal. i didn’t even know he was still selling, he told me that he quit when our daughter was born.

he didn’t even need to, he made enough money at his current job that our bills were paid and we always could eat. we just had a baby girl 8 months ago, we also have a 2 year old son and one on the way. i haven’t told my toddler yet. i don’t know what to say or how to tell him.

this was so stupid and senseless. i don’t know what i’m going to do. he was my protecter, provider, the love of my life and the one who took care of everything. he always called me his ‘babydoll’ because ‘i was just too darn pretty’. he always gloated about what an amazing cook i was. he used to tell me how much he appreciated me staying home with the kids and taking care of the house. he made me feel like the most amazing woman in the world.

we had been together since my freshman year of highschool. we had a beautiful 8 years. he adored his children and his children adored him. my son wanted to be just like his daddy. over a bag of pot. my babies will no longer have a daddy and i will no longer have the man i was supposed to grow old with. we were robbed of that today. i’m so angry. i have no idea what i’m going to do.

post_03031,"is it a panic attack hi so almost two nights ago, out of nowhere i started having a chest pain and i had assumed it was just bc i had been vaping for about three years, and then i looked it up and almost immediately had a panic attack i started freaking out my heart was beating like crazy i couldnt breathe and the pain wasnt severe but it was like uncomfortable and made me anxious so i took a cold shower which made it even worse and then i went to go ask my parents to take me to the hospital because i couldnt breathe and i thought i was going to die.  
once i got there they took vitals or idk im not sure what they are called but they said my heart rate was normal and my oxygen levels were normal and they did an xray for my chest and it came back they said i was a completely healthy 16 year old that had a panic attack and just needs to quit vaping, which obviously i am but its been a bit over 24 hours and i still feel like tightness in my chest and occasionally some chest pain and maybe its because im still nervous im gonna die even tho they said i was healthy but my parents said im fine and they called my doctor and the doctor said it was typical to still have pain afterwards? why do i still feel so anxious and scared to die even when they did the xray and they all have said im fine 
then why does it still feel tight and little sharp pains and everything i dont understand why i cant just turn my brain off and stop worrying about it bc the pain isnt unbearable its just im so hyperfocused on literally everything im scared any kind of pain i have means my lubgs are failing and im having a heart attack

oh and doesnt help that the small sharp pains and chest tightness is more on the left side too which makes me even more anxious im having a heart attack but idk maybe im also going through vape withdrawls since the last time i had it was right before i had a panic attack, anyways sorry this prob makes no sense ive just been struggling real bad the past few days and i hope im not gonna die from all of this ",1

post_06815,"bf called me fat while having sex with me. f/27 m/29
so. i’ve been dating this guy for 9 months now. he’s taken care of me when i was sick, traveled hours when we were long distance and was extremely sweet, caring and compassionate. 
but there’s been an issue playing on my mind since the day it happened 3 months ago and i just can’t shake it. 
we were having sex he grabs me and says he would really like to be able to lift me up over his shoulders and pick me up to f*ck and if i just lost weight and became more curvy, id be so sexy. mind you he’s saying this to me mid pump looking me dead in my eyes. i just freeze. not even sure what to say. 


i promptly tell him to get the fuck off me. and we don’t talk for a few weeks or have sex again for a while. he tells he only wants to be with me, but i could be better. 

during this time he continuously pursues me. telling me i’m all he wants etc etc. but i feel like the level of trust dissipated. 

for reference i’m 5’5 190ish, more muscular / hourglass. im a mixed girl, and carry the weight evenly, i’m definitely thick, but i’ve always been okay with that. 

am i overreacting to get upset about this from time to time. even though he’s apologized, i just can’t shake the feeling that he wants better and is settling.

edit: i’m not asking for unwarranted diet advice, just because you believe you’re fitter and healthier is great & i’m happy for you, but could really care less.  this post isn’t made for you to feel better about your self esteem / bodies on my expense. find healing ❤️‍🩹

edit: i’m doing my best to reply to all comments! thank you all so much for your responses. and to the wanna be gym bros & pick me girls, no one gives a fuck but i’m glad i gave you a chance to be internet warriors to vent your frustrations. now 4,000 people know you can’t lift 200 pounds but talk about working out? sus 😂

edit: i’m doing my best to reply to people.  but thank you all so much for your comments! 💗💗💗💗 i appreciate your points of view and words of encouragement. and to the trolls i wish you healing as it takes a sad and sick person to be calling someone fat especially when you haven’t seen my body and don’t know my health records, such weird and ugly behavior, i hope your mental health and body image gets better day by day. there’s so much more to life than being fake dietitians on reddit & as fit as you make think you are your disgusting  personalities still don’t take away from your perfect  “physiques” you all claim to have . never forget you can always experience weight gain through health issues and or mental issues so if all you have to offer is your body you’re going to be one lonely person, karma is real & internet trolling is so ugly 💗

edit: i’m having many people threatening my life in my messages over being fat…. are you guys ok?! seriously the effort being put into someone you don’t even know is scary. just because i rejected your diet advice… people are really that disturbed.. good lord. i’ll be reporting any of those comments / messages cause that shi is overboard now.",1

note: i initially went into a major i could not do and have been planning to transfer to another major. i was on academic probation because i failed a course but immediately cleared it.  this is also adding to the guilt as i wasted the money and i don’t know if it’ll happen again. i don’t trust myself at all.

post_05821,"i feel that the least selfish option i have is to rob a bank. i (27m) am loved by my family, i think. i have some friends. but as i stare at my ceiling for the nth night in a row, i am left crushed by the weight of existence.

i know the answer is in the simple and unexplainable things: friendship, love, the way the sun shines through my blinds in the morning, the outdoor cats i sit with in the parking lot, the ‘good morning’s of the people at the gym before the sun rises.

work no longer feels fulfilling, hobbies don’t scratch the itch, multivitamins and exercise and hydration and getting out of the house only take the edge off anymore. i am deeply, deeply alone. there is only so many times i can call the crisis hotline before the amount of resources i am using outweigh the potential societal benefit of me continuing to live.

nobody reaches out to check in, even those that i reach out to, to check in on them and just chit chat about whatever. it has been over a year since someone reached out to me first or invited me to anything. 

if i were to hurt myself, people would be surprised and devastated and with the way i feel about my place in the world, any amount of honesty on the way out would do more harm than cause closure. i would not leave a note.

i’m in therapy, i try to make friends and maintain the friendships i have, i’m on medication, i have a job, i have hobbies, i eat okay and i exercise, but i have no meaningful direction or purpose in life and waning hope for a future. i don’t know where i belong. i don’t know where i am or where i’m going anymore.

so i am left thinking:
if my suicide would be selfish, and i am continuing to just tread water while sinking further, then wouldn’t the best thing for me to do be to take myself out of society and into a controlled environment? the last thing i want to do is hurt somebody else. demanding a dollar from a teller and sitting outside until i get arrested would really only hurt me and my future. i don’t want to be a burden on the taxpayer or on society, but more than that i don’t want to be my sister’s brother who just couldn’t find a way to live anymore.

post_06669,"i lost my virginity because i wasn’t paying attention i was a freshman in college. it was my first time having a guy over. we were friends. id known him for close to 10 years. i genuinely thought he was there to hang out. he was older than me and knew i was scared to be away from home. we started messing around. i told him i didn’t want to go all the way, but he was in *that region*. he told me to close my eyes. i did. he penetrated me without a condom and without asking. i got so scared. i froze. he pulled out and said he just wanted to feel it. put everything away and left to try shrooms with his brother. all within a matter of minutes. i cried all night. then dated him for 5 years because it felt like the only way to make it stop hurting. i convinced myself that i loved him so that it wouldn’t feel like exactly what it was. i broke up with him when i woke up with his dick in my mouth.

post_06627,"i’m so tired of the reaction i get to my man’s height i’m so tired of the reaction i get to my man’s height

i hate that height is a fucking thing to be all oioowohhhh about in men. my so is 5’4” (or 5’5” i don’t know or care which). 

when i first saw him in person after chatting for a while i was like “oh he’s cute” not “shortshort short”. but every time i had to introduce him to someone new in my life, that was the reaction i’d get later in private. 

“oh he’s so nice but i didn’t expect him to be so short! i don’t think i could do that”

good. more for me you absolute weirdo. my friend at the time told me he had such a “sexy voice, i bet he’s hot” up until she saw him. then he became “good looking for a short guy.” 

he is hot, an absolute sweetheart and i just wish he didn’t have to deal with this bullshit from people. he’s my best friend and the perfect height (unless something is on the top shelf bc i’m one short gal and the stepladder has to get involved if i don’t want him climbing all over my clean  counters).

post_05892,"for the love of everything, please teach your kids there is a difference between swimming in a pool and an open body of water. after losing my 12 year old today, who was involved in a drowning accident 3 weeks ago, i really can not stress this enough.

she was an amazing swimmer, in the pool. she had never swam in a river before. and that one decision to jump into the river off of a dock cost her her life. 

so teach your kids the difference, and how to react if a current catches them so they don't panic. i don't ever want someone else to go through the nightmare that is currently going on in my life.

edit: holy hell you guys. i didn't expect this post to get this kind of response.

i do know it seems like common sense right? the kids always had access to a pool and we never went to the river. it never even crossed my mind to cover that kind of thing because she wasnt exposed to swimming in open water.  what happened was.. she was at a friend's. and they decide to go to the river. she jumped off the dock and never came back up. by time they found her it had been close to 15 minutes.

i made this post with the intent of reaching even just one person. i'd this made you think and reconsider how swimming is handled, then it did its job

post_04272,"does anyone ever feel like they are extremely lonely but are also the one isolating yourself? (ex: not going outside your house for days but also declining any offers to go out?) hi. i’ve struggled with this on and off since i was a young teen. i grew up in the suburbs with immigrant parents and one older sibling who was always out with huge groups of friends or gfs and never home. my parents never ever went out (socializing felt like a burden to them, didnt have too many friends, couldn’t spend too much money) holidays were just another day at home, never anything special. it wasn’t until the last decade now that all kids are grown and they’re retired that they started traveling the world and taking up hobbies and making friends. when i was a kid and i complained about feeling cooped up at home, they couldn’t relate to my anxiety. i always felt like my close friends always had “other groups” of friends or huge families where there was never a weekend or day they’d be home moping. always had groups of friends besides our core friend group, so on random occasions where every person was occupied, it always hit me how extremely lonely i feel.

now, as an adult it still hits me here and there. everyone knows i’m an extreme introvert and love being home. but lately i’ll be home for 3-4 days straight, can’t bring myself to leave my 1000sq ft apt i live alone in to get the mail, take out trash, or drive to run errands as my simple “socialization for the day.” i have a bunch of things i could be doing outside, errand-wise, or at home (chore-wise, ex: decluttering closets, getting some freelance projects done, job hunting, etc.) but instead i can’t bring myself to do any of them and fixate on my loneliness. 

i let the dishes pile up, eat junk food/instant ramen, just waste hours on youtube or the internet, sit around crying for no reason, and when people text me to hang out i decline. i don’t understand what’s going on with me, it’s like i’ve reached such a level of being a slob that i can’t bring myself to get ready in 20 min to go outside and hang. my family will even ask to have dinner or something, and the thought of having to coordinate 3 different parties and choose a restaurant and think about 5 hours of productivity i won’t get back (though let’s be real, i won’t be doing anything productive) gives me extreme anxiety.

i’m torn between wanting to bask in solitude and being miserable being so lonely. can anyone at all relate or is this an issue specific to me since childhood? am i just a lazy pos and that’s my problem?",0
post_05113,"my friend is at high risk of being hate-crimed & i can't do anything about it my friend has been on t for 3 years, something he's talked about since we met a decade ago. he moved to a red state a few years prior. his neighborhood was pretty keep-to-yourself, but since the election, have been getting more and more side eyes and snide comments from people in public. (the map showed the state voted over 99% red)

late last night, he messaged me--not unusual because he works graveyard shift. he assured me that he doesn't plan on taking his own life, even though his mental health has been spotty at best for the duration of our friendship. he asked if i could be in touch with him every day, even if it's just sharing memes back and forth--the standard of our comunication. he asked if i could act as an emergency contact, and get in touch with his family in case i no longer heard from him.

he works a job that pays just enough to survive out there, but would take literal years to save the pennies to move to a neighboring blue state, let alone back to his home state which is constitutionally safe.

post_02587,"my name is tyler, that’s my real name this is my only account, i’m highly suicidal, have been since i was about 6-7 years old, i’m 26 now and it’s different now. i’m going to tell you my story in a new attempt to gain enough relief to fall asleep tonight. thanks for reading if you do <3 
growing up, i was always a really weird kid. i distinctly remember that i had just seen the world differently. it seemed that my imagination had a bigger play in my life than most. me and a friend in kind garden would squeeze batteries in our hands and pretend that we were mario or pokémon because neither of our families could/would buy us a game console but we were exposed to them by relatives and tv. it was so simple back then and looking back so pure,  but it felt like we were there. we didn’t have what other kids had to have fun so we became those things. as far as i know i was a decent enough kid however when my brother came along around age 4, we would fight, i would hurt him, not bad (typically young brother bs) but still enough to get beaten from my father when he got off work. my father more so was (he is still with us) a rigid, traditionally hispanic in parenting, angry, regretful person. when he was in the house there was always a strange energy of danger even if nothing was going on. it was better to just stay quiet. this didn’t really work because my younger brother soon learned that it was an easy win when we’d bicker to just cry out loud, our dad would come in, beat my ass and i would curse my brothers name for doing so but alas it would get me to stop. my real last memory of child abuse before my teens is about 15 seconds of my dad putting me in a corner on the ground, telling me if i wanted to fight to put my hands up and when i did to just shield myself he pummeled me with closed fists. i was around 10 years old, maybe give or take a couple years, not sure, i have terrible memory of most my life. as i got older, my brother and i actually started bonding, he liked the way i started standing up to our dad no matter how bad i was beat down. he’s told me i inspired him. my mom btw is/was awesome, but didn’t really do much except yell to stop from the sidelines or leave the room since she couldn’t bear to watch. i can’t blame her, not much negativity felt towards her for i know she unconditionally loves me and that must’ve been a tough and traumatic experience for her as well. moving forward, i’m a decent student, normally averaging around low a’s my brothers straight a’s if not 100’s, not much of a big deal there, my mom started adding incentives once we grew into our early teens (for every a we got in a semester she’d give us like 10 dollars or something, it was dope so we did well). through out life i feel like i found connections that i would replace for my fathers love, through friendship. i grew very close and desperately wanted to fit in with my friends. i would spend hours out of the house riding bikes around the neighborhood doing dumb lil kid shit, but it was a really freeing time out i remember. fast forward, around when i was 14, my brother 11 my mom bought me a bass guitar because i had been getting into random enough japanese rock from the anime i would watch and to me the bassist was always the most bad ass and going crazy member, my brother came along and she bought him a guitar spur of the moment, figured it would help us bond. it did. it really did and i thank everything in this world for those times that followed because they were hands down the best years of my life. i was a shitty bassist and soon transitioned over to wanting to be a singer and my brother excelled at guitar, going onto be called a prodigy by everyone from teachers, producers and most of the respected music industry people we would eventually encounter. but at the time he was my little brother and being a fresh teen thought it would be wack to have my 11 year old brother in the band. i started a couple bands, the second one introducing my brother in as lead guitar. this was a turning point.

back to family life, my dad started to realize he was aging and i was starting to gain my testosterone fueled teenage body, this didn’t stop anything, but only extended our fights into actual fights. my dad, a correction officer, doing manual labor his whole life handed my ass to me every time. all while telling me to kill myself and how no one loved me and i was a mistake. nothing like this was said to my brother, unless in terms of how i’ve manipulated him into becoming just like me. i became a bit of a shitty protector of the house hold, two accounts stick out immeasurably to me. the first being (funny kind of a call back to how my brother would yell for my dad to come) my brother was upstairs and screamed tyler help dad just hit me. in a blind fury, i bum rushed my dad onto the floor, commanded my brother to hold his arms down and pummeled him in his face, chest, balls, anywhere i could hit before he brother free all while yelling the likes of “it used to just be me, that’s where you should’ve left it”. it was a powerful moment. my father spent the rest of the week walking downstairs like a caged tiger screaming and laughing about how he was going to kill me. ‘‘twas still a sweet victory. no fear.

i’ll speed up the rest: me and my bro made a band, everyone betrayed us, we made another and took full control of who was in it, wrote all the music, what we looked like, who we recorded with, and what not. with his help i created a two year plan to get signed to a label called fearless records. we played metal. it was therapeutic and empowering stuff to play after everything you’ve read thus far. 

we did it in four months.

i got a text by our newly acquired manager that we had been offered a deal by the label of our dreams. i cried and got sent home early. a record that i wrote all the lyrics to and my brother wrote all the music to, all fueled by the hate and distinction of our father son dissonance. it was the biggest victory a small town probably has seen, at least our small town. every time he said we were garbage, we should try something else, i couldn’t sing and my brother should play something nice. every time he laid a hand on us, put into songs and we did it in four months! still makes me proud to this day man. 

btw, this isn’t a story about my father.
he is not the reason i want to kill myself anymore.

the label fucked us over, made us record 3 different records each time hating something that they previously wanted and we called it quits. our deal was good n no need to recoup anything, just disband.

this is where whatever is inside me to this day was brought into this life. a foe i don’t know if i can beat this time. throughout the story so far, i had a flame inside of me. the whole time a purpose to prove. a will to fight. i always told people that i wasn’t sad, i was angry. and the anger forged who i was. a determined, skill ful musician, with the mane of a lion and the attitude to match, a man who did it. but when that all went away. i became a worm, but not yet.

shit with my dad cooled off, he retired. i’m assuming his job really was the culprit of the aggression and i stopped holding the past against him. at this point i had been a dumbass at points too and figured it was not worth the energy or the negativity of keeping that cloud around. was he still an incredibly ill informed, ego centric prick? yeah, but i was a different person now and couldn’t be bothered with it. most times shrugging off his comments. i had worth now.

me and my bro made another band with just our drummer from the previously signed act, but it didn’t last long, we did an all over the place ep that was uninspiring yet everyone we showed loved it. drummer left, became a solo artist, he’s a whole other story. i can’t help but feel as tho i’m responsible for his and my brothers mental state as i’m 3-4 years older than both of them (i was always the dad figure to them).

fuck it tho, rock n roll, we did it once we’ll do it again. me and my brother move to los angeles california in hopes of creating a new sound within the fusion realm of rap, emo, metal, and pop genres. we moved with two of my friends from ny and got a shitty two bedroom apartment and split the rooms. the other two room mates were supposedly friends for years yet fought constantly, shit talked each other and created this crazy negative space in this 1000 sqft. it was not comfortable to say the least. however the one room mate in specific, targeted my brother, who at this point basically didn’t talk to either of them. (this is point one and point 2 is my confesssion) and then there was me, i had developed an alcohol problem, not that i drank every day or even every weekend. but when i did, i became a different person, i would usuallly drink myself to sleep as well. my brother picked me up from a bar one night and while on his way i began to get robbed. i refused it and tried to buy time and ended up running to his car when he got there. amped on on about 10 jack n cokes and the adrenaline of potentially dying, i flipped shit on my brother. cursing him out, saying i didn’t need him, i could pay someone 20 dollars to do what he does, etc. it was awful. and it was the last straw for him. within the next week or so he packed up, quit his job and went back home. 

i was heartbroken, but covered it up with anger. my other two room mates, if you can believe it, convinced me that i didn’t need him and that he held me back. i thought i’d be okay and he’d come back, i left our room exactly how he left it for months. he didn’t. 

this was the final nail in the coffin for my mental state to date. i spend every night analyzing the past, and i think i’ve learned that at first i created a whole identity to hating my father, then after that i created a whole identity around me and my brothers music career and once he was gone and to this second of typing it, i’m lost. i don’t know what to do. my personality feels like it’s splitting. some days i’m this really cool extroverted ladies man guy and some days i’m a worm in my bed spending money he doesn’t have on post mates so he doesn’t have to leave the apartment. when i sit down and try to write music, i can, but i don’t feel it anymore. it’s the only skill i have. i didn’t go to a real college because of the deal, i’m not good at anything and i’m not interested in anything other than music. but there’s no inspiration left in me. nothing really makes me happy anymore. i had a gf, nothing, broke up with her, nothing i have a new one, i miss her sometimes but for the most part nothing, i have written 6 new songs, nothing, i post a photo on instagram, nothing, i go to work, nothing, i watch a movie, nothing. everything just seems so pointless now, i don’t see myself as the star i once did. i don’t even believe myself when i sing, or have conversation with people. it’s like i’m watching the most boring movie about someone that i just don’t even care about. i just want him to die. i just want to stop wondering and working and fighting, i don’t want to do it anymore, and i was the relief of death. 

idk what i expect from this but it was slightly therapeutic, thanks for listening.",1

**career**: i studied a career and i've been working in the same place for 4 years but the wage is not good and even though i have considered searching for other jobs the wage is worse. i consider myself a very skilled person, i've made a lot of courses that would help me and know a lot about my career but still i never get contacted for recruiters or when i get to the interview i never get the job.  
  
i feel it's unfair that some people with 0 skills for the job and that don't have a degree either get good jobs just for nepotism. my boss doesnt' even have a career but she got the job just for being the ceo's girlfriend. 

**personal life**: i just don't remember the last time i was happy, i feel like i've been depressed since i was 18, i used to spend almost all the time in my room and that eventually killed my social skills.   
i have a boyfriend that i love and we've been together for 10 years but we haven't get married yet and don't even live together because buying an apartment is almost impossible here. we just hang out on weekends but he's too busy in his job and we don't really talk a lot the rest of the week so i feel alone most of the time. i see the relationships of my friends and they just seem perfect, so i feel disapointed of mine. 

to be honest i don't expect anything from life anymore and don't see the point of still living but i'm not ready to kms. i know i'll never be able to buy a house, i don't think i could ever find a good job. i don't have enough money to go to therapy. i don't know if my relationship will ever move on.

i've been disconnected from reality to a degree that i could barely, struggling horribly keep up with my academic life. i've been struggling on everything else as i just cannot keep up with real life, since i was born, basically.

i've tried to focus on real life aspects, but it's always been too much for me. specially now, at university, where i simply perceive a wall made out of glass between me and my real life affairs.

last year, i didn't do any of my final exams. this year, my father wants me to show him my grades after i finish them, or he will take me out of my studies and take me to work. it's reasonable, it's fair, but i don't know if i choose to live after such failure.

they believe i'm probably going to perform will in my tests, which is simply a lie, i'm most likely to fail. i know their reactions won't be any good, and there's no point in negotiating, i've already tried negotiating with them, and they just tell me to focus more.

i might skip this exam too, i won't get more than 1/10, i'm so funking incredible that i didn't study.

	i’m in love with someone who is wanted by tons of beautiful women. he actually loves me too, he has proven as much to me, but my insecurities could eat me alive. we aren’t together in a relationship yet because we both are working hard on ourselves to stabilize in our own lives first, so that when we come together, we are able to enjoy our lives together as much as possible. however, he has been a player for years and my one requirement is monogamy. that’s his own area he is working on, but knowing he has unlimited options and will for the rest of his life, makes me afraid to really allow myself to open my heart completely to him. i know that when it comes to matters of the heart, i need to work on my level of security within myself, first. i have never felt worthy of anything good that deep down i know i really deserve. without trust, the love will crumble. foundation is key, and must be solid for you to be able to build something steady and reliable. i have always wanted a family, and although i have pieces of one, i have always wanted to know what it felt like have someone love and protect me, too. sadly, i have never had that love or protection. 
#(which is why foundation should be as solid as possible be for bringing children into the world, because without that solid foundation and love from your parents, it makes you sometimes yearn for any idea of love, allowing you to accept abusive behaviors and perpetuate those cycles).

post_03050,"want to share my recent experience when an intern md keeps insisting me to switch my current well-tolerated medication. possible trigger warning: struggle navigating healthcare

context:  
\> my main diagnoses is complex-ptsd  
\> i had decade+ long of mdd and dysthymia  
\> and through several years of aggressive multi-therapy my depression is now on full remission (basically i am no longer depressed)  
\> i only have gad currently  
\> i don't have panic disorder  
\> i don't have social anxiety  
\> i don't have ocd

however few days ago, i had this mental health assessment /consultation with an intern for a pre-cpt intake session. it did not turn out well it was frustrating to say the least.

basically, for whatever reason he decided from beginning and very, very insistent of me switching my very well-tolerated non-ssri anxiolytic medication to an ssri.

the thing is that i had all sorts of terrible side effects with ssri in the past and it took me months to very gradually wean off/taper off the ssri.

also, the thing is that, my current anxiolytic medication (buspar / buspirone) works very2 well for several years for me, and i never had any side-effect with it. no sedativeness, no withdrawal, no sleep interruption, and no weird serotonin syndrome symptoms.

it was very frustrating because he is talking about my medication as if it is a benzo, which is dead wrong because buspar is definitely not benzo. and that i should switch to an ssri because buspar has a shorter half life.

so, the consultation just dragged on and on... and eventually it took almost 3 hours. there were crying involved, and a senior psychiatrist who is familiar with complex-ptsd got involved and he made the decision to not switch my medication, and just let me do the cpt session without switching my medication.

anyways, i just thought the non-tactful approach of this intern md guy probably because he is not familiar on how to deal with the complex trauma patient like me. but it was a frustrating experience when healthcare folk hears what i say but not actually listening to us patients.",0

post_01867,"here we are, at the end of all things. here we are now, at the end of all things.

 i plan to end my own life.

 i have no time or date set yet but i know it is inevitable. and i know my death with be a relief to every person i have ever loved or cared for as my existence has been whittled down to just receiving and giving pain. they will sigh and thank me for relieving them of the burden of having me in their life. the burden lifted off their shoulders.

i truly ask,  what is the point of living in this cruel and heartless world any more?

 all i do is suffer and cause pain to anyone that comes into my life. i can't work or provide for myself. i am an emotional wreck and a dried up and useless husk of a person. i have lost the will to try, and i'm so tired of begging for help with no relief.

i'm 34 years old with no family, friends, education, job, house or car.  i don't have and can't afford to have kids.  i have no ambition, and no way to improve myself or my life. i'm stuck. my existence now is only meant to serve others. i get taken advantage of, used, manipulated and lied to. and the men in my life only want to use my body for their sexual gratification. i have no soul and they don't care about my well-being or happiness. just what i can offer them.

i have nothing to fight for and i'm tired of wanting to be happy, aching to belong and to be understood and loved only to be abused and abandoned. 

what really solidified this choice is the people i love and care about most, they have shown me how little importance my life really has because they walked away no longer caring if i live or die. showing me such coldness and neglect.  for god sake, my own abusive, belittling and demeaning family has even turned their back on me.

it's just too much.  too painful. i cannot handle another 60 years of this half life, scared to leave my home, scared to talk to anyone because i'd just recieve pain and rejection. i'm scolded for feeling emotions, i'm scolded for loving others and wanting to be loved. i can't do or say anything right. i'm always doing something 'abusive' or 'unhealthy' with no one in my corner supporting me or encouraging me.

i truly believe i have been cursed to walk this earth alone. and i'm not willing to do that.

it's been 34 years of misery, child abuse, neglect,  rejection, pain and embarrasment. and no amount of hospital visits, therapy sessions or medications can ever 'fix' or 'fill' this enormous void i feel inside myself. that in fact, i have always felt.  i've run out of patience, time or care.

i want peace. i want this unbareble pain to stop. i want the nightmares and ptsd memories to stop. and i want to be able to choose when and how i go out.

i've tried everything to love myself and to get better and be better but i just don't think that's possible for me any more unfortunately.",1

post_05206,"i thinking of breaking up with my partner and am scared so we’ve been dating for about 2 years. around the 1 year mark we started talking about moving in together, we agreed and starter we looking for a place to live. every time we did this this she would  act like a child being dragged to a furniture store, sulky, i would  have to console her and talk her out of moods, didn’t want tot be there, and did no work to help find our future home. this just made me so mad, that she was saying she wanted to move in and deepen the relationship but her actions were saying the complete opposite, i said this to her many times, we had many discussions before i got fed up and said i was thinking of  breaking up. this freaked her out, and she completely turned around.

fast forward 18 months, past that fight i feel more and more in love with her and felt the most in love i’ve ever been with her and finally got sure that i was in love, i was a bit shaky at the beginning. but also in that time she’s lost her job gotten depressed (which she is now finally seeking help for which is good) and we are now in yet another fight. we moved in together and we both agreed that we want to decorate and make the space our own. and again she’s acting like a child, not interested making excuses not doing any work and annoyed and dragging her heals. we never have any future plans,  no trips planned and it honestly feels like she is just planning on us breaking up at any minute. any time i raise this she digs her head in the sand and says she just wants to focus on having a nice fun day.

i said i thought maybe we should break up because we won’t compatible because i felt i wanted someone more serious than she did. she had a literal panic attack and we agreed to try for a bit longer and go to couples counseling. i honestly don’t know if this is a good idea or will help. i’ve been clear that i really want a committed long term partner  to maybe raise a kid with she wants that too, but is scared that we won’t work out so is holding back, this really annoys me because i don’t want someone whose half in like i don’t want to be the only person in the relationship that’s taking risks.

also i just, i don’t want to be in a relationship where i have to reach a breaking point of being ready to walk before she listens to me. i’ve been saying to her for 3 months that i am worried i’m falling out of love with her, that i love her and want to support her but it sucks to be around someone who is pessimistic and negative (which she has made a huge effort to stop and i appreciate it). i just also feel a little like her career now that’s she’s depressed in that we spend a lot of time me calming her down and helping her talk about her feelings but very little time doing the same to me. i don’t mind the amount i help her but i do mind that it isn’t in any way reciprocated. i’ve also said this to her multiple times that i want her to show more interest in my life and emotions (she does show interest i just want more)

also as soon as i threaten to break up which in my mind is not a threat because like i’m seriously thinking about it, she starts to turn it around and i feel so much better, which also annoys me because i’m like it would take so little to have a good relationship. like we could be so good together, but i just don’t want to have to drag her into a good relationship. like i literally feel if i give her a checklist of good relationship things to do she‘ll do them, but i don’t want that, where i tell her what to do and she does them. like i don’t want to be relationship boss, i want to be relationships co-partners. 

i honestly don’t know what to do. i really don’t want to break up because i think i do love her, i just i don’t know whats, wrong with me i just don’t feel it. we haven’t had sex for about 6 months, which might be a contributing factor to why i feel less in love with her? but i used to feel every day like i was falling more in love with her and now i don’t? is that normal or a sign we should break up? also last time we had a big fight it got so much better after and i feel so much more in love with her because she really did decide to commit more, so ,maybe it could get better from this? and  maybe she’s depressed so this is just a temporary phase rather than a permanent one. but i also don’t know if i’m just making excuses for her and i should break up.",0

post_03768,"i’ve been struggling with panic attacks randomly, my family situation pops in my head and and it makes my throat tighten and tear up. sometimes these can build up and i start ugly crying. i think these are anxiety attacks? 

recently however, nothing that i’m consciously aware of is causing this. it happens while i’m in public or in class too. my chest and throat tighten, i almost hold my breath, and i hold back tears. i think these ones are considered panic attacks since they seem to come out of nowhere.

i’ve been very overwhelmed this past year for many reasons. my main problem recently is that i am estranged from my family, and i am needing to figure out a lot of life by myself. i’ve  been hyper independent for most my life bc of my social anxiety, but i didn’t realize how many little questions i would ask my mom. 

i’ve been needing to see a doctor for something that’s not super urgent. when i got estranged, i needed to figure out how to get my own insurance, and i did that. however, the process of making an appointment and going to the doctor and figuring out how to give them my insurance is stressful to be bc i am incredibly awkward. i would’ve asked my mom what exactly i need to say on the phone, what do i say when i walk in so they know that i need to give them different insurance information. also i couldnt finish filling out my fafsa, but not bc i needed her information. i needed to ask about my own tax information bc i think i filed something incorrectly last year and i didn’t know what to put for for a certain section. those are just a couple examples, but it just keeps adding up. 

on top of that, a few months back i was losing sleep bc i wasn’t sure how i was going to pay rent. my car has so many issues with it. i keep getting turned down by basic entry level retail and food jobs. i don’t know what i’m doing after i graduate college. well, i have a single plan that i am not too passionate about. i could keep going, but it’d just feel like nagging. 

i have been really brave too, especially compared to how i was just a year ago. i’ve been talking more in my classes and asking questions. i’ve been trying to make more connections with people, although it’s more like acquaintances it’s better than nothing. i’ve reapplied to some places that turned me down, and i’m trying to do better in the second interviews. i’m not sure why i added this paragraph. i think i’m just trying to calm and reassure myself

i know i’m not the only one who’s going through something like this, and i understand there’s way worse situations i could be in

——————————————————————————

we have been together for five years, and living together for two years. 

at first he was really sweet and caring. he was literally the best boyfriend i ever had. as time went by he became more emotionally abusive — calling me names, putting me down, yelling, breaking and throwing stuff. i’d also constantly be told how i don’t spend time with him but at the same time i’ll be told how i’m always in his face. 

eventually he became financially abusive in a sense. he’d be reckless with his income which forced me to use all my income on bills and groceries, leaving me with no money for things i wanted unless i wanted no food on the table, utilities cut off or being behind on rent. 

while all this was going on, he was signed up to dating sites (with paid subscriptions, mind you) and when i came across it on the bank statements i was the bad guy because i was ‘snooping’. like snooping is so much worse than being abusive and a cheater. 

i was dumb enough to get two pets with this asshole. 

i have had enough. 

i recently got informed by my company that a role has opened up on the other side of the country. once i got confirmation that the job is mine, i will be taking whatever i can fit in my car along with the pets, all important documents, and i will be leaving. i will also be canceling anything that’s on my name. 

i’m counting the days to be free of this poor excuse of a person.

edit: i posted this before heading to bed, and i am blown away by all the supportive and encouraging comments. i’ll try to respond to comments where i can, but to give a reply to some common responses: 

- both pets are registered in my name so they are definitely coming with me.
- i’ll make sure to let my company (and trusted relatives/friends) know to not give anyone information on my location or contact details.
- all my current socials will be deleted. 
- all passwords will be changed. 
- i was going to just disappear without a trace but i’ll leave a note explaining that i am leaving and that i don’t want contact anymore. i’ll also be leaving the ring behind in case he wants to report me for stealing it. 
- i’m not sure i can trust anyone in my current city to not tell him i’m leaving to i might have to see if i could have an officer at the property when i pack in case he comes back from work earlier. 
- i’ve made a list of joint accounts or accounts of mine that he has access to so i don’t let one slip through the cracks when it comes to cancelling/removing my name/changing passwords. 
- i’ll definitely be looking into getting a po box and i’m also gonna change my sim card as soon as i leave.",0

post_00411,"i don’t need a rope. my severely autistic son is going to beat me to death. first off sorry if i don’t use the preferred terms for autism. this isn’t the functional kind. this is the smearing shit, piss on everything, holes in walls, nonverbal, violent, destructive, and incompatible with any semblance of normal existence. he’s an adult now, 18 and strong. 

every single day is a nightmare. i spent the bulk of last week wishing i was dead. i started thinking things might be better for him and he might get help if i were gone.  

i took a beating last thursday that left me bloody and another friday early morning that fucked me up pretty good. i decided next time i’d just let him finish me off. 

catch you on the other side. remember me when you see the news article, it’s just a matter of time.

i still haven't told him i know his cute secret and i'm not sure if i ever will. part of me wants to tell him that i know but another part of me doesn't want to. at least not anytime soon. maybe when we're old and boring and need something to talk about haha. i just wanted to tell someone because it's been something that's been on my mind for months and i just find it so adorable!

post_01746,"i’m such a coward  i can’t seem to attempt because of the pain. i’m so scared. i’m so freaking scared of the pain from any of the methods i want to go through. but i’m in more pain just staying alive, why don’t we have the right to die? i have wanted to end it since i was 5 years old, my first attempt was when i was around 8 years old. i’m so tired. i have been in pain every single day for the past 18 years. i don’t want this. i never wanted this. i don’t even want to leave my bed anymore. 

i don’t even have a job right now, i have applied to over 200 jobs i can’t find one place to hire me (i am a recent grad from the top uni in the country i’m applying to and i have past relevant experiences for all the jobs i’m applying to). i’m so tired. somehow rejection from the roles are hitting me harder than my mental health issues lately.

i just want to die so my pet can live with my parents peacefully and in out of the picture. i’m so tired. i just want it to end. i am tired of being miserable. i don’t even feel things anymore. the last time i actually felt emotions was over a decade ago. i feel numbed out emotions, it’s so watered down dude. 

i know it’s sad that i love my cat but i don’t even feel it. i haven’t been able to feel things in so long, well other than pain. 


i’m tired of being the disappointment in everyone’s life. i’m so tired. i’m sorry i exist, i don’t want. so many people have walked out on me and they’re lucky because atleast they can do that, me? i can’t even do that. 

some of you say i should try to date. like what’s the point? i don’t want to spread my misery onto anyone i like and it will happen. i mean i have never dated but still, if really good friends can walk out? so can partners? like i feel like i have been drowsed in gasoline and lit on fire since the last 18 years, that’s how existing has felt like to me. 

i actually don’t leave my bed anymore. for the last 1.5 years i just don’t leave my bed. if i do, if i go out with friends, i just dream of the second i came back to lie down on my bed. i just never want to leave my bed. it’s comfy in there, i’m always in pain and just sleeping it away sounds good until i remember the nightmares i get. but still, it’s better to be asleep than awake any day.

post_03103,"how do i stop thinking of myself as worthless because of no gf? im in college and any second i see a couple having a conversation having fun talking to each other i basically feel worthless. 

like literally everything external is like a test to prove my worth. gf, converse, friends, saying something funny or interesting or cool or valueable 

how do i stop thinking of others as goals to achieve and stop thinking that they are better than me in every way?

im like ""what does this guy that i dont"" 

it feels impossible to make any friends, impossible to make others interested or care, i dont know what to say or what questions to ask. 

its always one sidedness. always me initiating, chasing, texting, no one ever takes any interest in me or starts conversations with me 

3 years in college and not a single girl attracted to me. or ever showed any interest in me, i feel like such a loser. not a single person cares about me or knows me in college. i feel like i have no good qualities, nothing interesting about me. 

maybe i have behaviors or traits that are a turn off and pull others away? maybe i dont talk to much? and when i talk its to get a reaction out of others so i can be happy?

im honestly sick of journaling these same questions and behaviors and thoughts over and over again and not do anything about them because i dont know what to do about them. 

idk whats the next step.

post_05010,"my pay got lowered because of ai, so i quit used to work in a company for a short time for full stack development, it took me a very long time during summer to find a job because i don’t really have great connections, but i got someone to suggest me and got the job. when i started working there, the company started to incorporate ai (claude) to our projects, they were fine with it since it makes development faster. i am from serbia so the salary is very low here, i was paid 800e, and this might sound ridiculous because eu salaries are much higher, but 800e a month for the job was okay since that is what juniors are usually paid for web development in serbia. it is sad, but it is what it is…

so i signed a 3 month contract, but the workplace got pretty boring the longer i worked there, the collegues aren’t that intuitive, i like working in the office, but the office i worked at was so disconnected i had no idea where i am and why am i here, it was just mentally exausting, so i planned to quit eventually after the contract.

however, when my 3 month contract ended, my boss called in saying that ‘i am such a good employeer’, i got suprised, expecting a possible raise, but instead my boss lowered my pay to 600e due to ai use, as a compromise that ‘ai would increase productivity by 3x so you wouldn’t work as much’. honestly i got sick of hearing that and i just left.

i wanted to sue them but i literally have no money,  no lawyer, my country is shit and i can’t find a job because ‘nobody wants juniors’ for my position, and is getting increasingly harder. i feel depressed due to this, and probably activated my anger issues. i just want to go elsewhere to a normal country, or someone to help me out…",0
post_01095,"is there really any point anymore? i feel like i’ve been depressed for most of my life. and thats just such a waste. i see people my age going out, they have hobbies, have fun, have quirks, develop skills and talents, have a true passion for something. develop themselves into someone who impacts others and has an impact on the world, will go out to create a lasting-impact/meaning.

i have none of that. my only characteristic is just being miserable. i feel like a waste of a human being, a shell of one. like a failed human being. i know i shouldn’t be feeling like this and i’m only 18. but really what’s the point when my entire life has just been mental sickness? i don’t feel like a developed person. it’s like i stopped aging when i was younger. i’m still such a dumb kid who can’t grow up. i’m an adult yet i can’t grow up yet the world is moving so quickly, and everyone is expecting me to grow up so fast, act my age. 

a failure of a human being like me can’t do that. i’m sorry. i’m sorry to my mom, who i can never treat right and always take my anger out on, my mom who always tries her best for me even if she’s scarred me in the past. it’s my fault i couldn’t move past our traumas. 
i’m sorry to my dad who i’ve lied to, i couldn’t show him that its been long since i’ve been his happy, perfect little girl. 
i’m sorry to my brother who i could never open up to. my other half who could never possibly understand me. 
i’m sorry to my friends who care for me, it’s my overthinking that suggested otherwise. yet i know none of you can ever understand what i’m thinking. you’re all developed human beings. 

i’m sorry for blaming all those around me for my problems. it’s been me this entire time. it’s my fault that i can’t contribute to society, not even my studies or my future. it’s my fault that i’m rotting away in my bed in this trash-like room. but i’m really tired now. there’s no hope for me anymore. i have no future, and i won’t live for long. that’s just how it goes for someone like me.

post_05728,"i dropped out of uni and now i dont know what to do with my life i am 21 years old and i dont know what to do anymore with my life. i started studying art history at the end of 2023. i've actually always been interested in it and was really looking forward to moving to a new city, living in a shared flat and starting a new life and getting away from my hometown. at the beginning everything was fine and i was motivated, but after a few weeks i felt so mentally unwell again that i hoped every morning that i wouldn't make it to my lectures. 

i've been struggling with mental health for about 10 years but this time it was worse. at the beginning of 2024, i was so unwell and a family member died that i simply stopped going to university. also, i was always so scared of oral exams sometimes and my first presentation completely sucked because i was so anxious. i was so embarrassed that i didn't want to go for that reason alone. 

so i moved back to my home town. i felt really bad and that i had failed in my life. i still feel that way. since then, i've felt even more that i'm not allowed to be happy. since then i've only been at home and i don't have anyone, because my friends have all moved away and i'm no longer in contact with them. i also tried therapy for the first time last year because i feel so depressed and unmotivated. but then i stopped going. so i decided that i would start another course of study closer to my hometown.

i thought maybe everything would get better now, but after a few weeks i couldn't go anymore because i had such panic attacks and i didn't like it there at all. since then i've been looking for apprenticeships for this year, but so far i've only gotten rejections, which makes me even more scared about what will become of my future. i feel like a complete failure and deeply regret every day that i moved back to my hometown and didn't continue studying art history. i

so now i'm always at home and have no motivation at all and nobody to talk about my problems... i don't even do my hobbies anymore because i feel so depressed and i feel like i don't deserve it as long as i'm not doing anything like going to university. no matter where i am, after a while i always make everything bad, although looking back it wasn't like that at all. even my art history degree was always bad for me, the people, the city... although i could have considered myself lucky, because now i have nothing and i'm worse off than ever. i'm really thinking about starting to study art history again..

i'm really hopeless and have no idea what to do. i just know that if nothing changes soon, i won't know what to do...

post_03190,"fear of blood draws and iv's, but not needles. how can i prepare myself the best to actually get them done. hey everyone,   
anyone here scared of getting their blood drawn and iv's because of ptsd of your past and have the ability to now be able to do it.  
i have a 40 year old and in the 80's and early 90's i had form of leukemia, because of this i had to get my blood drawn for my platelets and 3 times a year i had to stay in the hospital for a weekend.  
i say this because in my teens and 20s and found that i pass out during these times. i still did it, but i would pass out.  
in the last year my doctor, because of my age, wants to check me for clots and cancer. i know this is super important and i want to for sure, but every time we talk about the test or i even go to the room. i start crying and push my way out of the room.   
i am so scared of this that i eat health as i can. no caffeine when i can, very little sugar and and go for a walk or run 4 times a week.  
with this being said, last night i just got up, went to the bathroom and when i left the room i turned off the light took a few steps and either hit a wall and the floor or hit the floor and passed out for a few secs.  
i, of course, went to the hospital because this wasn't something that is normal for me. i told the doctor my fears to make sure they knew i couldn't do this because of my ptsd. they gave me a ekg and found an ""amorality"". he didn't know what my normal heart rate looked like, but would like to draw blood to check for clots or something that could harm me. when i tell you i tried, i really tried. i stayed in the room i asked from someone to be in there to talk with me and as soon as the nurse came in with the box to draw i freaked out and just kept saying i wanted to home and cried.  
i know i need this done to make sure everything is ok with me, whether by my normal doctor or an er doctor. so, this is why i ask this. was there something you all did to help you so you could lay down and get it drawn? in case you are wondering my ptsd was i saw someone get their blood drawn and passed out on the floor, blood everywhere.  
also, back in the 80's they would strap you on a board to not let you move i can feel it every time someone talks about it. also, when i was in my 20's and i got my last draw i passed out and the nurses made fun of me for doing it.  
it is not needles because i am almost fully immunized. mom's fault on not taking me to the doctor so i now i have to go and from the 12 i was missing i am happy to say i have the last 3 to take this wednesday and i'll be good.   
this is also, the reason i am hoping to ask you all for help i have my appointment on wednesday and i know i can this.   
oh, yes i have a therapist i have seen for one year now and she is amazing and has helped me to at least go into the room where they do the draw.

sorry if this is super long or i didn't write this the write way, i usually just read stories, but this is something that if i can get passed or even help someone that has the same fears or question that would be amazing.

post_06433,"for the past 5 years i've been living a different life and nobody knows [long]  i grew up in nebraska, living with my dad because my mom took off when i was 2 and we never saw her again. my dad was extremely physically abusive and would spend all his money on drugs, which meant unless i could stay with a friend i most likely didn't eat that day. my dad didn't keep tabs on me, so as soon as i was old enough to work i was supplying my own food secretly, because if he knew i had money he'd take it. i bought an old car off a friend, fixed it up, saved up a couple grand and took off when i was 17. i didn't tell anyone. i didn't even really plan it. i just packed up my stuff one night and left. i worked odd jobs over the next few years, working long enough to make a paycheck and taking off again. my goal was california, and by the time i was 19 i had made it there. i changed my name, started going to college and after a few months got a decent job. i have a pretty nice apartment, friends who like me and even a girlfriend i've been seeing for a few months now. none of them know who i used to be. i tell everyone my parents are dead, and answer personal questions about my past and the scars my dad left on my body with vague responses. to my knowledge, nobody suspects a thing. every single thing i am i have made myself, and that's how i want people to know me. the stuff i went through with my father growing up deeply affected me, and still does. but i am done being scared of him and i am done letting him control me. 

edit: wow. just...damn. i'm floored. honestly i didn't post this with the intention of thousands of people reading it; to be honest, this secret has been eating at me lately. i wanted to make this post just to see what it would feel like to have it out there, so that maybe i would be more comfortable telling someone. and...just, holy shit. thank you so much for the kind words. upon reflection i believe that in part, distancing myself so much from my past gives me an excuse not to deal with it. i never had anyone supporting me when i was young, but i do now. i have friends that have done so much for me emotionally, and of course my girlfriend. i don't know if we're going to last but i'm serious about her, and i think everyone was right in saying that she deserves to know. i know everyone in my life will be supportive if i tell them, and i will. i'm not sure if i'm 'ready', but if i keep waiting i never will be. thank you again everyone for the kind words and encouragement. you've all done so much for my self esteem and confidence regarding my situation, and i can't thank you enough. thanks for reading, and sorry for the long edit.

post_06302,"my wife poured a bottle of water on me and i think i'm done this happened a few weeks ago. my wife and i were arguing about how to cut onions. fucking onions. i had stupidly thought that i could do it, that i could chop up onions and add them to the chili as she asked. she came by and got pissed, telling me that i'd cut them too coarse, that they were supposed to be much smaller, and that the chili was ruined because i'd put them in the pot. i said 'okay, let me just get them out, they're just on top and i was just trying to do what you asked, i can cut them smaller' and i start to pull them out with a spoon. she says, no, that's okay, don't do it, she'll just do it. she pushes me out of the way and takes the knife out of my hand. i let go. 

my self-esteem is shit. i start to complain about how i did what she asked, and if she'd wanted them put onto the chili at the end, she should have just asked for that instead of me putting them into the chili while it was still on the stove. i desperately wish i could do something, anything right. i retreat to the other room, as i'm pretty fucking sad. i'm 28 years old and i can't make canned chili, apparently.

i sit down on the bed, trying to stay out of my wife's way so she can fix my mistakes. she brings in dinner, and i'm ready to drop the problem. i eat, and she eats half of her food, then brings it back up. i apologize multiple times. she doesn't seem satisfied. i try to explain myself then, that i feel like maybe she should have communicated a little better if she'd wanted the onions as a garnish instead of just in the chili. she tells me i'm not listening, that i'm cutting her off. i don't understand. i feel like we're taking turns. i desperately try to stay calm, keep my voice quiet. as calmly as possible, i say that i would appreciate it if she could be more specific about what she wants. then, she snaps and pours the entire glass bottle of water all over me. as she does, i can hear myself saying, 'please don't', as water runs down my face and back. it's making a huge mess. she drops the bottle on the floor and walks out. water is everywhere. i start crying really, really hard. my first instinct is to clean the water up. wipe it up. get the blanket dry. i tried so hard to be good. i tried so hard to keep my calm, and it got me nowhere. 

i get my keys and leave, still crying. my wife starts crying as i walk out, telling me i don't care about our relationship, that i'm abandoning her. i just tell her as calmly as i can, that i need to be alone for a little bit. i go out for an hour and sit by the library. i'm cold and wet. she calls me several times. i don't really want to answer.

i haven't been okay since this. i know it seems stupid, but this event has pulled up a lot of bad things she did to me in the past when she was going through a lot of other things in her life. she's apologized for some, others she doesn't even remember. verbal, emotional, physical. i don't think i can stay married, it's like everything keeps boiling up. i don't know why this. maybe i'm overreacting. i don't know.

**edit:** hello everyone, thank you for all of the support, thoughts, and advice. it's really nice and upsetting simultaneously to hear from so many that what happened was not in fact ok. i was really scared to post this, and i've been reading every single comment here. thank you all so much.

i want to add that i am also a woman too (my wife and i are both women), since many of the comments and responses are assuming i'm male. thank you again for your thoughts/encouragement and for the hope. i feel very alone right now, but this has helped me.",0

post_05070,"i regret so much.... throw away.

i spent too long in a toxic relationship that should of ended 8 years before it ended. it left me with trauma, issues, and a will to prove a jerk wrong. i found happiness a few years after escaping my old life. i worked hard to reclaim my life. i've gained a life partner and was working on starting our family.

then i got a phone call. from my bio mother. asking if i could take in my sisters kid. i did. and everything changed for the worse. i haven't been able to keep up with fertility treatments. cps and the parents are uninvolved. the parents fight everything schooling, health, therapy. every time they call they scream at me. bring up how i am childless, how my background education in psychology means crap, and a ton of other things. the personal attacks against me have been messing with my mental health.

i want to quit. throw in the towel. not because of the child, but the parents and cps. i don't want to put my life oh hold. i want to opt out. ",0

post_03114,"ativan making me hyper??? for a little back ground i don’t really deal with anxiety but my doctor treats my insomnia as stress induced insomnia. i’ve been on lunesta, ambien, sonota, and zimovane. 
 i was prescribed ativan last wednesday and i have a very lightened mood and no side effects but i’m still not sleeping. by not sleeping i mean i go 1-2 days with no sleep (in the past it was worse) and then sleep for 4-5 hours and do it all over again. the ativan almost makes me feel hyper and i’m not seeing anyone else talking about this side effect. if you are or have experienced this please reach out because i feel insane and don’t want to feel insane alone.

last night i finally slept after days of being awake even if it was only for a few hours then again today i had a small nap. 

i ran my life today and it felt great. i hope this feeling stays... although i could use some more sleep which i hope comes easily tonight.",0

post_07616,"lost in the darkness lately, i find myself drowning in an ocean of despair, struggling to find a glimmer of hope to hold onto. it feels like every aspect of my life is crumbling around me, and i'm just standing in the middle of the chaos, unable to move.  i've been battling with overwhelming loneliness. it's like a heavy cloud that follows me everywhere i go, suffocating me with its presence. the people i thought were my friends have slowly drifted away, leaving me to face my demons alone. the silence is deafening, and the emptiness is consuming me from within.  on top of that, i've been facing financial hardships. i lost my job a while back, and despite endless applications and interviews, i still haven't been able to secure another one. the weight of financial uncertainty is crushing my spirit, and i feel like i'm running out of options.  to add to the pile of struggles, my family has been going through a rough patch too. my mother's health took a sharp turn for the worse, and watching her suffer has been tearing me apart. the medical bills are piling up, and i feel utterly helpless in the face of her pain and mounting debts.  every day is a battle to find a reason to keep going. the thought of ending it all has become a constant companion, whispering seductively in my ear. i'm so exhausted from pretending that everything is okay when it's far from",1
post_00632,"i fucking hate humans who treat suicidal people like they are some negative demons ffs i'm so tired of this. yes i am negative. i'm fucking suicidal. i'm not enjoying life like you do. people treat me like shit for being suicidal. then they talk how understanding and caring they are. i can't act negative because they don't like it. they say ""just be yourself"" then i show my genuine self and show how much help i need. then they say ""go away. you're so weird"". they even proceed to kick me off from every place they see me. why? i'm too suicidal and that makes them feel uncomfortable. fuck you. just say you hate depressed people in the first place instead of saying them to open up just to slap them in the face. this is exactly why some people kill themselves. people like them kills people who actually want to live. then they say bs like ""wish that person opened up. we could've helped him"". rot in hell, genuinely. 

for the person who's reading this, i'm so sorry if you've gone through the same thing. you have the right to say the way you feel no matter what. don't trust people who are too nice. i'll be there for you.

edit: i didn't thought this post would blow up. i assumed it's just gonna fade away. but damn, i don't feel alone. there are people who understand what i say. that actually makes me smile. there are people who went through the same thing and i know there are understanding people out there. it's frustrating and sad to hear how the world works but at least i know that's how it works. love you all sooooo much for showing that i'm not alone.",1

post_02907,"alone so, a while ago i lost my friends after leaving a psychiatric center, as a result of a suicide attempt



since then i have felt very sad, it is difficult for me to do the things i like to distract myself, i wake up and the only thing i want is to anesthetize myself with marijuana



i started going to alcoholics anonymous, since before my hospitalization i had problems with alcohol



leaving the center, i felt happy. after many years, i managed to forgive those who had hurt me and above all i understood that i was hurting myself.



i started talking again to someone i cut contact with, everything was going well, he no longer responds to me, nor sees my messages, and it makes me feel lonely as shit



i want to cut ties, but it is very important to me, but at the same time it is exhausting to know that the other party is not on the same plane as you.



right now i feel empty, and more alone than ever, i really never thought i would fall into this abyss again after recovering my soul.



they took it from me from one moment to the next and i don't know what to do.



i don't want to wake up anymore, i don't want to feel, i don't want to suffer anymore



i'm thinking about taking my life this year, at some point i'll definitely do it, now i just have to continue surviving alone",1
