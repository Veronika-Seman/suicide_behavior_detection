As a former therapy client and a practicing psychotherapist, I have always been interested in how therapy works, too.\n\nOne topic which I have thought a lot about and written about is how a therapist’s efforts to understand a client play a role in healing. Importantly, I discovered that a therapist’s ability to capture the client’s emotional state and put it into words – also known as empathy – creates a bond between client and therapist and also reduces the client’s distress. There is much more information on this topic in my writing. Let me know if you would like more information.",

    "selftext": "I have been in therapy since November for the first time in my life due to depression and anxiety.\n\nAt first, I felt very comfortable with my therapist and had no problems opening up, but due to some things she said/reactions she had, I developed a creeping feeling she might not believe me or thinks I'm exaggerating. I pushed through that in hopes for help with my issues.\n\nLast week in session I noted how I don't see a goal for therapy at the moment and how I wanted to more clearly formulate where I want to be going so that I can profit off of therapy long-term. That seemed to rub her the wrong way, but session was over.\n\nThis weeks session started by her being silent until I said something; luckily, in the meantime I thought deeply about what I want to get out of therapy, what I would like to achieve and what are goals I want to work towards. I went on to tell her those thoughts and she didn't seem to agree/understand/believe (?). I thought it was a miscommunication and tried to reword myself to clear that up. Apparently, she misunderstood again (?) which was very frustrating. It was important for me, however, that we were on the same page about that, and tried to reword and explain, which clearly agitated her until she started to rant about \"her having problems\", used weird comparisons to try and get her point across (which either I understood and didn't think wasn't suitable or didn't understand, which makes me wonder what the point should have been).\n\nI spent the rest of the session trying to get her to calm down, but frankly, this terrified me, especially as some of my problems are thinking people are angry with me all the time (even though at the very least mostly not true), being afraid of being a failure, and doctors/teachers/other professions with authority not believing me and berating me even though I was later proven right.\n\nThis session left me in a very bad mental state (full nervous breakdown, was unable to hold a conversation for a day, had to cancel meetings with friends because I just couldn't, sui. ideation) and now I am doubting myself, my experiences and therapy. Can you fail at therapy?\n\nIs this okay? Do you think this is an issue worth working through with *that* therapist or is it a red flag? I have the impression of having to walk on eggshells around her and I think this destroyed at least some of my trust.\n\nI know I need help, but this was such an uncomfortable experience, I'm not sure whether therapy is the right kind of help for me. I've heard that therapy sometimes has to be uncomfortable to work, so I braced myself for some of that, but I'm really not sure whether this is what was meant by that, so I am asking you therapy-experienced folks! Im grateful for every one of your opinions on this! Thank you in advance!\n\nEdit to add: I am currently in an okay mental state again thanks to persistent and supportive friends, so no acute worry needed, I just noticed when reading again the above might sound concerning",

I speak, then I can feel myself react ever so slightly or sometimes more forcefully and then I know how I think or feel about something. \n\nAt home or alone I \"debate\" with myself. I pretend I am explaining something to someone, or I replay events and acting out my part and it helps me process them and \"practice\" for the future.\n\nMy T said yesterday that I tend to intellectualize and I talk too much, and I do agree with her. When I was little I shut off my emotions bc it was \"unsafe\" to feel and express them and I lived in my head and words atw my thing. I totally see her point. And it's been my goal in therapy to make myself more vulnerable, let others see my emotions, cry in front of her, and with my recent trauma (accompanied by attachment trauma in childhood) there's enough to be vulnerable about. I want to feel them, go through them, allow them, and then feel the safety she brings and have the corrective experience that having and expressing emotions is ok.\n\nBUT, she also said, next week she wants to take my rational thinking by the hand and tell it how to guide me through my emotional flashbacks when I'm alone and there's no one there. And I'm like, huh? You're saying I'm intellectualizing and then you want my thinking part to be in the lead? \n\nIs there something I'm missing here? Besides the fact that when being hijacked by my amygdala I cannot really do much rational thinking? Yet I do talk during my emotional flashbacks, a lot; and it helps, a lot. I also write, a lot, during those, and that is very helpful also.\n\nSo what's with all that talking, and why does she criticise it and yet she still, that's my impression, wants me to rather think than feel?",

    "selftext": "For the past few months, I’ve felt somewhat dissatisfied with my therapy sessions. (To give some context, I’ve been seeing this psychologist since late 2023, and this is my first time ever consulting a mental health professional—I’m 24 years old.) I have the impression that my psychologist doesn’t fully explore certain topics or responds in a very general way.\n\nFor example, today I shared that I had been reflecting throughout January (this was my first session since December) on the idea that, in order to be happy, one needs a certain degree of ignorance—whether voluntary or involuntary—about things and the world. I also mentioned that, despite working on my personal issues, any form of progress I make feels overshadowed by a sense of fear and anxiety about the current social context. I illustrated this feeling with an observation I’ve made in the media and on social networks: the increasing radicalization of men’s discourse toward violent and misogynistic rhetoric.\n\nHer response was that this isn’t happening on a societal scale, but is simply present on social media, where people feel free to say whatever they want because they are hiding behind a screen. However, I believe this is inaccurate—I'm a PhD student in sociology, and I closely analyze discourses on social media as well as in traditional media. I had never before observed such explicit, prominent, and openly endorsed rhetoric. It felt like she was downplaying my concerns by telling me that “this isn’t true, it’s just a minority” or that I should “protect myself from these discourses.” I find these responses overly simplistic. Maybe I’m wrong, but I feel like we don’t delve deeply into the issue, and that this dismisses and delegitimizes my feelings—namely, my anxiety about this phenomenon.\n\nThis isn’t the first time I’ve felt this way. Often, when I share negative interactions I’ve had with others, she minimizes them by suggesting that I might be exaggerating or attributing intentions to people who didn’t actually have them. However, I believe I have a pretty good intuition when it comes to social cues and interactions.\n\nI’d love to hear your thoughts on this kind of situation: Have you ever had a similar experience? Could the issue be coming from me? What could I do about it?",

    "title": "Accusations of not being active enough. Started by abusive parents and then repeated by therapists and other people.",
    "selftext": "Seems like I’m starting to see more clearly the connection between my past and what triggers me now.\n\n**When I think about the messages from my mother that formed my self-hatred, if I want to generalize and express them in one phrase, I can probably say they were accusations of not being active enough** (lazy, cowardly, unconfident, not responsible enough, passive). Sometimes I could feel it in my bones that she literally hated me. Now I understand that those words from my mother weren’t actually about me but about her husband, my father, whom I was so unlucky to resemble in appearance and with whom she had her own issues, especially after he stopped living with us. She was simply venting her anger at him on me. But back then, during my teenage years, at some point, **I developed a feeling that something was wrong with me — I was pathologically weak. This is a significant, if not the main, cause of my complex psychiatric disorder with numerous symptoms.**\n\nUnfortunately, **I heard similar messages — essentially accusations of not being active enough — many times later from psychologists and psychotherapists**, both directed at me personally and in the form of general advice for people with mental disorders. I’m very sensitive, for example, to reminders that I can be active and influence my life. I don’t need those reminders. I grew up on Terminator 2 with its motto \"there is no fate but what we make for ourselves\". **I ruined my health by regularly pushing myself to the point of complete mental and physical exhaustion so that no one would accuse me of being weak, insufficiently active, or unwilling to change my life.**\n\nOne therapist caused me **severe retraumatization, from which I still, 13 years later, haven’t fully recovered**. He constantly said things that sounded like accusations of not being active enough. For example, when he’d say things like \"responsibility for your life.\" I felt awful, my anxiety increased, and my symptoms worsened. At the time, I didn’t fully understand what the problem was, but I tried, how I could, to explain to him that I felt bad because of those words. At first, he agreed that this wasn’t what I needed, but at the very next session, he started saying the same things again.\n\nNow that I understand my issues better, I can explain more clearly what exactly was wrong with the messages I received from him. **I didn’t need advice to be more active or more responsible. What I needed was the opposite** — turn off the gas and go to sleep. Don’t check it a thousand times in fear that someone might get poisoned because of you or that the house will explode. Relax and stop feeling so responsible. **For someone with an overdeveloped sense of responsibility, advice like \"take responsibility for your life\" can be very painful**.\n\n**It's very disappointing to see so many psychologists assuming by default that the problems of people with mental disorders are because of insufficient effort.** Constantly, I see many psychologists who, in their videos and articles, on forums and chats, in various ways, directly and indirectly, in person and in general, reproach people with psychological problems for not being active enough. A large number of psychologists, for some reason, believe that people with mental health issues don't understand that they can influence their own lives, that something depends on them, that they need to be active, etc. **For some reason, they think by default that the problem of a person with a mental disorder is necessarily related to being too passive**, so they are quick to remind them that they need to be active (\"to take responsibility for their life\", \"to get out of the victim mentality\" and so on).\n\nIt seems like some people find this helpful, but the thing is that many others are **triggered by these words because they are receiving the same traumatic accusations they got in childhood**. This is especially true for the male gender because shaming men for not being active enough is deeply ingrained in our culture.\n\nIt’s quite hard to stand against such things because such views are very widespread among people in general. Our culture has a deep-rooted cult of success, activity, achievements, and strength. When people see someone with mental health issues, weak or helpless, their first assumption is often that he/she is not trying hard enough, not active enough, doesn’t want to \"take responsibility for their life\", is in the \"victim position\" etc. **It seems to be so hard for many people to understand that the problem could be, and often is, the opposite.** Those suffering from mental disorders often don’t need to be reproached for not being active enough — they need to be listened to and feel supported in a safe space. They often need to learn to relax, rest, be spontaneous, and act out of enthusiasm, not self-coercion. They need to learn not to blame themselves and not to hate themselves for their failures, flaws, or weaknesses. Often, they need to learn to overcome perfectionism, the desire to control everything in their lives, or the guilt for resting or relaxing. **For many people with mental disorders, the problem is not insufficient, but excessive activeness (workaholism, exhausting obsessive states, fear of losing control, excessive responsibility and thoroughness — these are common neurotic symptoms), or it’s about setting themselves excessively high goals and hating themselves for not achieving them. Receiving accusations for not being active enough can be very painful for such people.**\n\nWhen ordinary people don’t understand this, it’s sad, but psychologists should understand these basic things and try to avoid saying something that sounds like a typical reproach from a demanding parent. **Not to echo typical messages that neurotic individuals were exposed to in childhood.** Yet, strangely, this is exactly what many of them do in abundance, which leaves a very depressive impression.\n\n**I think the root of the problem lies in the universal desire for people to feel control.** The feeling of losing control is one of the main signs of a traumatic situation, and it can be very painful. People want to feel more control and often consciously and unconsciously try to convince themselves and others that they and people in general have or can have control. The problem is that these constant calls to be active, to influence, to control, etc., help some people (those who feel they don't have enough control), but harm others (those who try to control excessively). **If your trauma was formed from childhood reproaches about not being active enough, you will constantly feel external pressure. You will constantly receive similar messages from others** calling for activity or reproaching you for being too passive. To resist this pressure, you need to build a particularly strong mental armor.\n\nIt seems like now I need to start building such armor so that I don't get triggered every time. But it won't be easy, as I still have some doubts that maybe they are right, and I really am not active or responsible enough, not putting in enough effort, etc.",

    "selftext": "I considered making a throwaway, since my T and I are both on Reddit and joke about potentially finding posts/recognizing each other on therapy subs all the time. But, whatever, if he connects the dots and attributes this post to me. I don’t care anymore.\n\nI also feel very raw and sensitive about this whole situation, so please be gentle.\n\nI have been seeing my T for about 2 years. I initially connected with him to process various traumas and attachment issues, after realizing I needed a therapist I could trust enough to do that deep dive with and not being able to find one to save my life. He’s amazing, and we have built a very close connection. The past year in particular has been absolutely brutal for me. Enough for me to say that I would not be alive today if not for my T, and I wholeheartedly believe that.\n\nNeedless to say, I’ve gotten very attached to him. I developed transference, and I disclosed that, but I spent the better part of a year talking around the thing and the extent of my feelings for him. For one, life in general was so overwhelming that it was difficult for me to dive deep into anything, and I dissociated often. And on the other hand, transference is one of the single most painful and shameful things I’ve ever experienced, and there isn’t exactly a guidebook on how to navigate that as a patient. It’s basically “tell your T!” and then the path ahead is foggy.\n\nAs I’ve worked through this, T has expressed once or twice that he has wondered whether it’s ethical or treat me, and if working with him is doing more harm than good. When we discussed it, the takeaway was that he was going to give me the time and patience to work through what I’m ready for, and he trusts my judgement.\n\nWith that safety and consistency in place, I’ve actually made a lot of progress over the past few months. I disclosed much more about transference. I have better managed my SI and substance use. I’m talking about my root issues that feed into the transference, finally, after going through hell to get here. I’m not out of the woods, but I have hope for the first time in a long time.\n\nThat brings us to this week. I genuinely thought his ethics concerns were put to rest because of the progress I was making. Turns out, not so much.\n\nFor context, I see him twice a week. Earlier this week, I disclosed some difficult and vulnerable things. After a very hard and heavy session, he said toward the end, “And then there’s the question of whether it’s ethical for me to treat you. But we’ll table that for another time.” This made me spiral pretty hard. When I was still struggling the next day, I texted him about how our session brought up fears that he was going to abandon me so he’d have that context going into our next session.\n\nI was expecting our usual song and dance. I have anxiety about attachment or abandonment that I disclose, he assures me he’s not going anywhere, and those fears are put to rest. But this time, he starts off saying, “We’re going to have a hard conversation today,” and brings up ethical concerns again. He told me he would cause me pain if he cuts off the relationship, and it would cause me pain if he stayed, and he can’t win either way. He even talked about me seeing a different therapist to “process what happened to me here.”\n\nHe’s going to continue to be my T, but our relationship feels fragile and uncertain now. I had egg on my face when I read what I journaled about my fears since our last session and asked for assurance that he’s not planning on going anywhere, but my fears were only amplified.\n\nI don’t know what I’d do if I lost him. I’ve told him there were times he was the only thing that got me through. I’ve told him that nothing painful that therapy brings up compares to how painful it would be to lose him before I’m ready to be done. None of that seems to matter. I’ve been absolutely distraught and crying on and off for hours. \n\nI’d get it if I was still in limbo with my progress, but that’s not the case at all. I’m honestly terrified. I’m scared that whatever I disclose from here on out will be the nail in the coffin for our time together. If all that I’ve done to dig deep and talk about hard things isn’t enough assurance that we can move forward together, honestly what would be?",

I also think it can be counterproductive, especially for deeply traumatized people with severe mental health disorders and difficulties in expressing anger and asserting boundaries. But judging by the comments under the video, many people seem to like this advice.\n\nWhat do you think about it? Does it seem empowering to you? Or is it counterproductive?\n\nUPD: Here’s how AI suggests replacing words in that advice so that it doesn’t sound like victim-blaming and devaluation:\n\n*“My mom behaves in a way that makes me angry, and I want to learn to manage this emotion better.”*\n\n*“My mom’s actions were unfair and hurtful, and I want to find ways to protect myself so these actions affect me less.”*",

    "selftext": "I had group art therapy for the first time recently. \n\nBasically for the first meeting, we sat at a rectangular table that had cups of pens, markers, and crayons. \n\nThe facilitator put on calm instrumental music, then sat down with us. He sat next to me, which stressed me out a lot. \n\nHe had us do an icebreaker where we each would say our name and something we do to cope. \n\nMost people were really open about what they were going through or went through... their diagnoses and the meds they take. I just said I like sleeping, even though I wanted to tell them that I cope by watching sad videos, sad scenes from movies/tv shows, or I listen to sad music. \n\nHe explained that we could draw whatever we'd like, then we passed down a folder of paper to pick out from. I picked the smallest piece of white paper. \n\nI was not sure at all what to draw and I was a bit lost, so I asked him what we are supposed to draw. He said anything, and if we needed help on deciding what to do... then he can help us in a direction. \n\nWe then just drew or colored whatever we wanted. \n\nI saw my therapists name on the cup closest to me... and I just picked pink at first because it was the most noticeable marker and easy to pull out. I put it back because don't like pink and it made me more lost on what to draw... I picked a yellow sharpie instead because I like Yellow.\n\nI still did not know what to draw... so I thought about the sad Doctor Who Vincent Van Gogh Episode I saw the other night and drew a sunflower. I also drew an angry sun burning someone alive and wrote some stuff. \n\nWhile The facilitator was drawing on his own paper, he kept trying to look over at what I was doing. He really tried looking over when I was scribbling fast with zig zags. I got scared and covered it with my hand from him seeing it. \n\nI know he kept looking over because he told me that people really had to look close to see what I was doing. He later saw the small writing on it, and asked me about it. I just told him that I wrote something random and laughed it off. \n\nWhen it was time to leave, he touched my paper and told me that I could leave it there and I said okay, and pushed it towards him. Then he started pulling it closer to himself asking, \"We can talk about it\"? I got scared and said no. He kept looking at it though. I let him have it, and I got my stuff, and walked out. I said thank you as I left. ",

One of the things I have been working on in other forms of therapy, for about ten years, is a history of pretty severe sexual abuse starting when I was three. With all my past therapists, it was okay for me to say that it would take us working together for awhile for me to trust them enough to talk about the details of how this has affected me.  Setting that boundary was something that I learned from a previous therapist (who is no longer practicing), and it's been really helpful in allowing me to create my own safe space in therapy, while still pushing myself to be \"effectively uncomfortable\" enough to make progress. \n\nThe psychoanalyst I'm working with now has been in practice for 30 years and is highly respected as a professor, although she doesn't have any reviews as a clinician. \n\nWhen I explained my preference to her that we establish a trusting rapport first before diving into sexually traumatic subjects, she initially agreed. But in every session since then, she has continually brought up wanting to hear about my sexual fantasies, how they relate to my trauma, and any sexual dreams I have.  I've pushed back a couple times, and the last time it happened we were near the end of our session anyways, so I just begged out a couple minutes early saying I had other obligations. \n\nShe responded by saying that I was trying to establish power over her by withholding on the topic of sexual abuse, and that she does not respond well to patients who play with power dynamics. I know sometimes Lacanian psychoanalysts will intentionally \"trigger\" patients to provoke a reaction that they think might be constructive in the long run, but this doesn't feel conscientious or constructive to me. \n\nIs there any way to push back within the framework of psychoanalysis that is appropriate? Or should I just cut my losses and seek out another therapist?",

I was telling her that I just needed her to listen to me and try to understand how I felt. That’s what she said angrily “well, I get to defend myself” and told me that what she said was fine. And then she sarcastically said “I’m sorry I can’t say anything right” ….. 😥 I’ve had so many issues with her already and I just keep thinking she will stop behaving like this and bringing her own feelings in. She even told me that she was “at capacity” with me telling her I was angry at her. I have told her several times in the last few weeks that I have anger over a previous rupture that isn’t resolved. But I haven’t felt safe enough to talk about what I’m angry about so that’s all I say - so basically she just knows I’m angry. I don’t treat her badly. I’ve been really focused on a big health issue actually (which is why I asked for additional support) so it hasn’t been THE priority but it’s definitely on my radar. I’ve sort of been testing the waters to see if it’s going to be ok to say more b/c historically she doesn’t handle “criticisms” or angry feelings towards her well.

So basically she is saying “I’m uncomfortable sitting with this”. :/ \nI told her that I should be able to take the time I need.

Obviously for her own sake. \nLike I said - we have history - and honestly I know it’s time to move on but I can’t seem to pull myself away … there is still an intense attachment because for years she had no boundaries and treated me like a friend/daughter.

Therapist seemed like a nice person, but I don't think they were ever a fit for me (I'm quite cynical) and they also seemed a bit disorganised, to be honest, which seemed to make it more difficult for me to engage.  The focus of sessions was fairly classic CBT and to me it felt like we wasted a lot of time explaining it and I struggled to resonate with the approach.\n\n  \nI want to return mainly due to anxiety stopping me from doing important things in my life, causing me to struggle to sleep etc. Also hopefully to try and address lack of confidence (and very low self-esteem). On paper, it seems like CBT should maybe be the right approach for me, given I don't have trauma. For context, I did have a highly functioning alcoholic as a parent as a child - never abusive, didn't forget to pick me up, I wasn't worried about what I'd find when I came from school. It wasn't pleasant ofc, felt like parents were on the brink of divorce a lot/heated arguments/worried about him driving in the morning/sometimes I felt like I hated him and I didn't like that feeling. **But** I had a comfortable childhood and did have good if complex relationships with my parents, so don't really think this is trauma even if it's atypical (obviously this is a very summarised view).\n\n  \nLong story short, I'm not sure if I should specifically ask to try something new or if maybe the CBT didn't resonate because of the therapist - and how best to address it if it's not working as I really struggled to do that last time!",

With my last therapist(different one), I didn't really have this problem because he was a lot more engaged, asking me questions and talking more in general. But now I'm about to start with a new one and it scares me that it might happen again.\n\nMy story is not particularly \"salacious\" or interesting(widow, grief, depression, ADHD), and the parts that could be more interesting to talk about are very personal and I won't be comfortable sharing them on the first few sessions I don't think. This is also \"public\" therapy, as in government-funded, so I had to be on a waitlist for several months and if I don't \"hit it off\" with this new therapist I'm afraid of having to wait a long time again. Things have been really bad lately, lots of sitting in a locked room crying and dark thoughts, so I really don't want that to happen. I'm also in a pretty small town so I don't have that many options even if I could afford private, which makes the pressure even higher.\n\nI'd appreciate any tips for how I can present myself on my first session to make a good first impression.",

I was attracted by her style at first because she lets me talk a lot and works with dreams and other manifestations of the unconscious. However, what's been bothering me is that every session starts by her telling me \"I'm listening...\" and it's entirely up to me, week in an week out. \n\nI must say that as much as it gives me freedom, this also puts some pressure on me and I miss not having to, in a way, prepare the following session, picking up from what I talked about previously, not having a sense of structure and evolution in the therapeutic experience... plus, she barely speaks. She sometimes asks clarification questions or makes me focus on something I said, but I do 95% of the talking all the time.\n\nWhich may be fine as long as we were thinking of this as the \"getting to know me\" part... that's why at the end of the last session I asked her what we're working towards and if there is a plan to our meeting each other. She bluntly answered that \"there is no plan, you just come here and talk, and that's all. Stop trying to exert control overt things, this is part of your problem.\" Honestly this left me disappointed and upset. As far as I know, it's important for the patient to be spontaneous but also be guided and know that they are working towards a goal.\n\nAs much as her approach does have some upsides (the dream work, etc.), I am seriously considering finding someone else after being made aware of this. If it's all about talking for 30 mins, fine, but if little comes from the professional I'd rather do that and pay myself... Any similar experience / any advice?\n\nThanks very much!",

All this happened while I was being rejected from other jobs that I was applying for then I got accepted for one at an amazing company… in my hometown.

    "title": "I find my therapist's constant curiosity and questions annoying",
    "selftext": "tl;dr My therapist asks endless questions; I find his curiosity threatening and annoying. But I guess other patients would find it comforting and validating.\n\nMy therapist asks lots of questions, naturally.\n\nThe thing is, I don't like therapy, and I don't like talking about myself. So I'll talk about my anxiety and describe it, and he'll ask me how it feels, and he'll ask me when I most feel anxious So, I'll describe how making connections with other people makes me feel anxious, and working on stuff I enjoy makes me feel anxious (that's a big problem), and my anxiety feels like it starts in my chest and rises up to my head.\n\nSo he'll keep asking questions about that, other times I've felt that way, when the feeling was stronger or weaker, if anything helps.\n\nHe offers very little insight in return, maybe a few observations, but mostly just more questions.\n\nTo me, his curiosity feels intrusive and, actually, kind of threatening, even though it's not meant that way. I think he has nothing but good intentions. With other therapists I've had, it also feels like a threat, so it's not him.\n\nAlso, it's a lot of effort for me to describe what I'm feeling, because sometimes I don't really know how I'm feeling. So I'm doing all the work, and he's not even helping me describe how I'm feeling. There's no, \"well, maybe you felt this way? Here's how you might feel, and this might be why. Does that make sense or not? How do you feel about that?\" There's none of that.\n\nI've always wondered why I seem to get less out of therapy, and have a tougher time with the nuts and bolts of it, than other patients. Maybe this is part of the problem?\n\nI guess to most/all the other patients out there, a therapist's curiosity makes them feel cared for, that someone is curious and interested and seems to have no other motive than getting to know them and trying to help them.\n\nBut for me, it's irritating and annoying. I don't like talking about myself anyway, or being vulnerable. Plus, it's a big effort to describe my feelings and figure out what's behind it.\n\nSo I do all this work, and I push through the discomfort, and all I get in return is more questions. No insight, no solutions, no analysis. If there is any of that offered, it's usually pretty weak and bland.\n\nWhen I told my therapist all this, he was really surprised. I asked if he could empathize with finding curiosity threatening, and he said it was very difficult for him to understand it, and even harder for him to empathize with it.\n\nI realized also that being curious is most therapists' \"love language.\" It's the way they convey their interest and affection and intention.\n\nBut when I go to all that work and discomfort talking about myself, and I don't get \"anything\" in return, I feel like I'm being ripped off. I feel like, \"I'm not just here to answer your questions.\"\n\nI want insight, I want new ways to look at my issues, I want deep explanations for why I have the anxieties I do and what to do about it. At least, I want a way forward in therapy: how long is this going to take, is it going to help, is there a rough path this treatment will follow, how will I know it's working.\n\nThose are all questions that the therapists I've had can't really answer.\n\nI feel like, if you want me to accept your compassion, you're going to have to earn it.\n\nI guess it's not that I just find being vulnerable threatening. It's that i find being vulnerable - without insight and competent insight - threatening. I want a therapist to show competence and specific knowledge for my struggles, not just unending curiosity and compassion. But, I guess for a lot of therapists and patients, that curiosity and compassion, and the bond that comes over time from all that endless curiosity and compassion, is most of what it's about. I guess.\n\nI guess most patients initially feel nervous about therapy but gradually become more comfortable with the therapist's attention and curiosity. My reaction is different - I find the sustained therapeutic curiosity itself threatening and enraging, and this doesn't seem to diminish over time.",

And it is SO weird when you're crying for something you don't even exactly remember...it even feels fake.\n\n But i guess it was real, cause my body was asking for it. It feels so cliché when you hear about people suddently crying about their childhood, and that sometimes our problems have been buried there for so long...and when you least expect it, there you are going through it too.\n\n",

    "selftext": "I'm nearing the end of 5 weeks away from my therapist. It has gone ok mostly. But I have noticed an increasing anxiety in the last few weeks. And alongside that, there has been a relinquishing of self care. I don't mean daily activities of living, I am washing and being productive lol. But I just don't think about myself much, I've put the old shutter down on myself and turning my attention outwards as a mother, a wife, a nurse. Which is how I've always done life. And sometimes I actively despise myself, tbh. And it's frustrating. I have always put a lot of effort, as does she, into not leaning into a dependency on my therapist. I don't reassurance seek. I don't rely on my therapist to sort my shit out, I do that in sessions and away from it. I put a lot of work in. But the reality seems to be, that if I don't have that anchor in the week for accountability. If I dont feel understood and validated and like someone cares, I fall back into not caring about myself and leaving myself to struggle and the old feelings of satisfaction that that brings for me. If no one else cares about me then I won't either. It's been eye opening and a bit depressing. On goes the work. ",

    "selftext": "I've been going to my therapist for two years now.  Over the past year, I have struggled with anxiety (catastrophizing) like never before.   It has become a focal point of my therapy for the last six months.  She recommended that I see a specialist for an evaluation possibly for OCD.  A few days later, she sent me the names of those she found through Psychology Today.  I called one of the psychologists on the list.   Her office called me back and said that she didn't do evaluations, but did therapy. I decided to see her anyway since she was experienced in certain areas like ADHD, anxiety, and OCD.  My assumption was that psychologists are allowed to do more like diagnose and/or prescribe medication if needed.\n\nI see my therapist weekly.  I saw her this week which was my first session after seeing the psychologist.  She didn't realize that I was going to the psych for therapy.  She thought it was for the eval. that she recommended.  I told her that I was seeing the psych again in a few days.  When I told her that, she suggested scaling back our sessions.  She figured I was going to see the psych weekly going forward.  I didn't plan for that to be the case.  The psych just told me that was her next available appointment so I accepted. I expected it to be at least two weeks away.  I planned on these psych appts. to be temporary until I figure out more regarding what is going on with me. \n\nIn my area, we have inclement weather going on so my \\*psych\\* session for this week was rescheduled.  She asked if I could meet Monday, but I decided against that, because that is when I see my \\*talk therapist\\*.  I thought about what my therapist suggested and thought to myself I probably should not see them both on the same day.  I really feel as though I messed this up.  I didn't go to school for this, so I blame this on my lack of knowledge.  Does anyone have advice on how I should handle seeing both? Or any feedback on how I have so far?  I did give both permission to communicate with each other.\n\n",

    "title": "I (21F) forgave my bf (22m) for cheating on me because of his abandonment issues",
    "selftext": "\n\nThis is going to be a bit of a long story, sorry in advance\n\nI’ve been in a toxic, 3-year relationship in the past, which has left me with significant trust issues that I’m still working to overcome. When I entered my current 10 month relationship, I was still healing but thought I was ready for a healthy one. However, I quickly realized my past baggage was affecting my present relationship. I found myself constantly checking my boyfriend’s phone, obsessively looking for signs of betrayal, even though there was no evidence. After some time, he told me I needed to stop, as it was damaging both to him and to myself. That’s when I recognized I had a problem and began therapy to address my trust issues and self-sabotaging behavior.\n\n\nI’m proud of how far I’ve come; my boyfriend has noticed and praised my progress, especially since he knew what I had gone through in my previous relationship. He and I took things slow when we first met, the first two months after we met off of Hinge we had no physical intimacy at all, not even a kiss, which helped build trust. I even opened up to him about my past, explaining that I wanted to make sure I was with someone good for the right reasons. Over time, he showed me that he cared about me for who I was, not just for my body, which was a refreshing change from my past experiences.\n\n\nThings were going great at first. I felt truly loved and safe for the first time, but I also had this nagging fear of getting hurt again, what we had going seemed too good to be true which I expressed to him.  Before I had started therapy there was a day I felt so loved by him and started crying, telling him how I was scared to get my heart broken again and being so soon after my previous relationship I didn’t think I was healed enough to be in a healthy relationship. After hearing me say this he started crying and began to have a full blown anxiety attack, the first of many that I would witness from him. At that point he had already fallen in love with me and the thought of me leaving scared him. Over time, I started noticing signs of trauma in him too. He struggled to open up about it, often becoming overwhelmed and having anxiety attacks when he tried. I felt in the dark for much of our relationship, unsure of how to help him. At the same time, I tried to encourage him to make some positive changes for himself, such as cutting down on alcohol, stopping vaping, smoking less weed, prioritizing other things over video games, and seeking therapy. \n\n\nHowever, although he agreed to change, he never followed through; it was all talk, no action, and the communication between us started to break down. We had an argument at the end of October that was really bad and ended with me saying I told him “if you want to break up, I understand”, because I had lied to him about how much time had past between my previous relationship and when I met him. Saying those worse to him, . I didn’t know how much worse that would make the situation in his mind. He started crying harder and told me “that wasn’t even a thought in my brain, I never thought about breaking up, do you want to give up on us that easily?” At the time I hadn’t known, but this argument amongst other issues we were having would spark the downward spiral of our relationship.\n\nTwo weeks ago, I gave in to the urge to look through his phone, even though I had worked hard to stop doing so and be able to trust him. I could help myself and hadI found evidence that he had been cheating on me. I confronted him, and after initially denying it, he admitted it. He had cheated on me twice with a woman that worked in a store right next to his job, both times after we had been fighting, argument after argument, and hadn’t been intimate for a while. He explained that he had been drinking heavily, which was the case almost every night since we had the big argument where I had admitted to lying to him, which I previously mentioned. He drank so much he practically blacked out which led him to make poor decisions. \n\n\nThey had hooked up twice before he knew me, when he first moved to the state and started his new job. He said wasn’t attracted to her in the slightest, but he was lonely, knew no one in the area, and gave into her desperation for attention that she was throwing at him when she constantly visited him and flirted with him at work. She continued to do this even after we started dating and she knew he had a girlfriend, but didn’t care and in moments of weakness he succumbed to his demons and her temptation. There was no intimacy at all anytime they were together, every time it was quick, and the two times he had hooked up with her while we were dating he had wanted to be as detached from the reality of the situation as he could and didn’t let her in his apartment as he had before we were dating, and restricted the hook ups destination to her car, in the parking garage of his building complex. He told me he had no idea why he did it, he hadn’t wanted to do it, but he had no control over his actions, and was deeply disgusted by what he had done both times he vomited afterwards.\n\nWhat followed was an emotional breakdown on both of our parts. He shared that he had severe abandonment issues stemming from his childhood. He tried to explain this trauma to me multiple times throughout our relationship, but every time he tried he would break down and have an anxiety attack as if he was physically unable to speak about said trauma. Finally after 10 months into our relationship, he was able to open up to me and be vulnerable, it's just unfortunate that it took such a betrayal to do so. \n\n\nFrom his childhood he has been abandoned and unwanted, he was brought into this world by accident, neither of his parents wanted to care for him, his family didn’t pay much mind to him, his longtime ex before me had cheated on him and stole his cat. Both his parents were also serial cheaters so he grew up thinking it was a normal thing for the longest time and all the people he had loved in his life left him. As someone who also had mental issues I can understand how much trauma can alter the brain’s thought process. Both times he had cheated on me were after his trauma had been triggered by our arguments, decreased intimacy, and led him to sabotage our relationship by cheating. Before this he had never cheated and always claimed he would never because he felt the pain that was caused by cheating when he experienced his parents cheating on each other as well as the pain from being cheated on by his ex. \n\n\nHowever, like me, he thought our relationship and connection was amazing and too good to be true, and was scared of the heartbreak that would ensue if he poured his entire heart in effort into the relationship and did what he knew he had to do to be a good boyfriend. He claimed had purposely not put his all into being a good boyfriend and doing the things I had asked him to and begged him for because he was scared I would reject and abandon him at his best, so he was protecting himself by only giving me minimal effort so that if I did leave him it would hurt him less. He claims, because of his trauma and childhood, his brain convinced him the only thing to do after all the arguments we were having was to self sabotage and cheat on me, ruining the relationship by his own hand, before I could break up with him on my own accord, abandoning him. Despite his betrayal, he assured me he wouldn’t do it again and has already gone back to therapy and has started showing up as a better boyfriend already.\n\nIn the two weeks since, he’s been making a real effort to improve, and I’ve chosen to forgive him and stay. He’s showing up for me in ways he hadn’t before, being more open and honest. I believe that by staying and showing him that I won’t leave, even after he did the worst thing he possibly could to me, can help him feel secure and begin to heal. However, I also realize that being in a relationship with someone who has deep-rooted abandonment issues can be challenging, and I need advice on how to navigate this moving forward. I love him and want to help him heal, but I also want to protect myself from being hurt again. How do I balance supporting him while maintaining my own emotional well-being in this situation? I’ve never been involved or known anyone with abandonment issues so any advice helps at all. Thank you in advance\n\nHe’s in therapy now, I’m in therapy, and we’re going to be starting couples therapy together as well. I’ve also read that relationship that reconcile after cheating end up being stronger than before and I can honestly see that happening with us. He’s practically a different person now. He’s open with me, honest, vulnerable, so much better at communication, already treating me so much better. It’s sucks it took him cheating on me for this to happened, but he says that this is the wake up call he’s needed, seeing how hurt I was caused him to have even more pain and gave him the motivations he’s needed to actually want to heal his trauma and become a better person for not only me, but himself as well. I’ve forgiven him already because I know and understand that he’s been through a lot and how hard it is to not have 100% control of your brain and thinking processes. He loves me even more for staying even after all of this and honestly I think I love him more (although part of me still hates him for cheating on me and hurting him like this) because he’s trusting me to be this vulnerable and tell me something only his therapist and his parents know about. He didn’t even tell his longterm ex about this trauma, she tried to make him, but he wouldn’t. He has never been motivated to heal until being with me and I think I was out in his life to lead him towards that healing and he was put in mine to open my heart more and be forgiving and patient.\n\n**TL;DR: My Boyfriend (M22) Has Abandonment Issues & Cheated On Me (F21) I forgive him but need advice on how to handle a relationship with someone with abandonment issues ",

    "selftext": "I’ll start off by saying that I think my therapist means well and I’ve made, I think, some progress with him (though I also sometimes think I’ve made progress moreso on my own because of outside factors). \n\nHowever, I keep thinking back to how, on our first ever meeting, I didn’t feel like he was the right fit. I felt like he didn’t seem to like me – he was not very warm or friendly and seemed skeptical of me/I felt kind of judged.\n\nI didn’t really “shop around” for therapists because he was the first recommendation I got from a previous therapist and I didn’t bother looking into other ones who took my insurance. I just needed to talk someone and I guess didn’t have it in me to be discerning.\n\nI think this has changed – I’ve been seeing him for 1.5 years, he has certainly warmed up to me and sometimes even laughs at my jokes. He does say supportive things and challenge my less helpful points of view…however, I think back to our sessions a few days later and sometimes get angry and frustrated about something he says in the session.\n\nOne of my biggest points of distrust is about the topic of medication. We have different views on this. I have a natural distrust toward them due to family upbringing but also because of my previous therapists (it’s not that they distrusted medication, but they never said they thought I could use them like my current therapist has). Also the potential side effects scare me.\n\nIt is concerning to me that he keeps saying he believes mental health issues have a strong biochemical component – when the “chemical imbalance” theory has been disproven. I haven’t brought this up yet, it’s just something I always think in retrospect. He also said “maybe SSRIs” is something I should try in one of our very first sessions *without knowing anything about me*, so he has a pre-existing bias toward medication that I distrust and don’t appreciate. He doesn’t push it or anything, but he has recently brought it up as the next “logical” step  when I was having a hard time during one session. I had actually decided I would try them before he said this, but I didn't say anything because I didn't want outside influence about my decision. I kind of pushed back but he didn't know that I had decided to take them.\n\nHowever, since then, I've not taken them, and all my old doubts have arisen like: How do we know the therapy is the issue, not my lack of taking medication?\n\nMy previous therapist (that I had to leave because of insurance issues), when I had asked if he thought I needed medication (this was years ago), said he’d like to keep trying doing therapy with me before recommending that. I also know from counseling at my undergrad (also many years ago) that there is evidence-based treatment like CBT and the like, and that it is considered *just as effective as medication.* The fact that my therapist does not subscribe to that philosophy and wasn’t ready to exhaust all other methods before ever suggesting medication bothers me. \n\nIt also bothers me that he says “SSRIs have been around for a long time” as a reason for why I should trust them, I guess (I’m very scared of the side effects).  No, they haven’t! Not really, in the grand scheme of things. They are considered a new-ish drug. Medical professionals don’t even know *why* they work.\n\nAlso, he just doesn’t think like me, and it bothers me when he doesn’t seem to understand my train of thought, or my point of view – it makes me worry because like I said, I've had therapists in the past who just \"got it\" and I fear that another therapist can help me more than he has.\n\nTo elaborate, I don’t think he understands my line of thinking the way therapists in the past have – I’m more of a metaphorical/poetic/detailed thinker and I don’t think he always gets or appreciates my metaphors, whereas therapists in the past have. I mean, it took me literally over a year before he finally laughed at some of my jokes – therapists in the past usually always laughed pretty early on. He's not like, a grumpy all-serious old man (he's not old) or anything, and he has said helpful things, but again, I just don't think we click. Now I’m angry because I’m thinking I’ve wasted too much time with him.\n\nI know people say “bring this up as an issue,” but I don’t feel comfortable bringing it up because we’ve kind of butted heads about SSRIs a few times now and I don’t think he’s going to get it.\n\nHe does validate my feelings and everything, no major therapist “red flags,” but these things just keep on bugging me and I’m wondering if I should look for a new therapist and get a “second opinion”, so to speak, on whether I actually need SSRIs or if this is just this therapist’s biased opinion.\n\nCan anyone offer insight?

While I missed the F2F connection, I felt it was worth it because of the rapport we’d built over time. She’s the first therapist I’ve truly connected with after a string of unsuccessful experiences, and I value how well she understands me.\n\nHowever, our last session left me feeling unsettled. After updating her on my week and where I’m at emotionally, she told me she felt a “disconnect.” She said something wasn’t feeling right and suggested it might be due to the lack of in-person interaction. She gave me the chance to respond, and I admitted that I’d been feeling a bit empty and less happy than I let on. She then suggested we begin wrapping up our sessions and that I consider seeing someone she could refer me to—someone who can work with me in person and might better suit my needs.\n\nI was devastated. Part of me wonders if she’s made the decision to phase out online clients so she can focus on her in-person practice, and this is her way of easing me out. But I’m also questioning whether she truly believes we’ve reached a point where virtual therapy isn’t effective for me anymore.\n\nI’m feeling lost and unsure about what to do. I have another session with her next week, and I’m nervous about where the conversation will go. I don’t want to start over with someone new, but I also don’t want to keep trying if she believes we can’t progress virtually.\n\nI’d really appreciate any thoughts or advice. Has anyone been in a similar situation? How did you handle it?\n\n*TLDR* Therapist (2.5 years F2F, 6 months online) suggested we wrap up and transition to someone new who can see me in person, citing a “disconnect.” I’m devastated and unsure whether to move on or try to salvage our virtual therapy.",

I've been labelled a people pleaser and all I hear is be assertive but we never talk about what that looks like for me or anything.

But when my therapist said that we had less time to talk, for example, and that we would continue this in the next session, tears came to my eyes and the little one in me wanted to cry out of disappointment because she had been looking forward to talking to him. Then I had another moment when I wanted to cry and that was when he told me that he would increase the rate because he had to go along with the index.  I didn't show anything on both occasions and he didn't see anything on me but I could cry immediately and I had to fight to hold back my tears.

    "selftext": "How much I long for my therapist's touch is driving me crazy. I just want her to hold me. I imagine she does it when I try to relax and fall asleep at night. I have this recurring fantasy where we're both inside a large body of water, a sea or a lake, and she holds me close while I'm curled up. It's so intense, I imagine her eyes from real close. Sometimes the fantasy becomes sexual but most of the time it just feels like I want her to hold me like a baby, completely safe and protected. Even when the fantasy is sexual what I fantasize about the most is being close to her body, feeling her breath and her warmth, her being happy and satisfied and completely in the moment with me. I know I didn't get this from my mother as an infant.\n\nIts so hard how intense this is. My therapist knows i'm very attached, she knows I think about her at night, knows I need her. But it's so hard to tell her about the physical part of the fantasies. I guess I just find it disturbing, and I don't want her to find me disturbing. I know it will be helpful to tell her. I also guess she already knows. I talk a lot about how desperately I need non-sexual physical touch from my boyfriend and how it often feels like nothing matters besides him holding me.

    "selftext": "Hi all, I hope this will end up at least somewhat concisely. \nHowever, for all those that do not want to read a novella, essentialy the problem I feel unable to overcome is: How can I get over the fear of telling my therapist that I feel extremly attached to her and am ashamed for it because she has already given me so much I thought I had lost and a do not want to further drain her? I want to tell her everytime or write it down at least but I never actually do it, as I suddenly feel blocked to do so. \n\n\nI have been struggling for years with massive depressive symptoms and can only find reasons for my existence in not wanting to negatively affect others. Recently I was able to get a diagnosis for ADHD on my own insistance as my meds would only be covered with the diagnosis. This was great to find out, as it gave me the final push to go to therapy rather than only seeing a psychiatrist. Initially I only wanted this to work on my social anxiety limiting me greatly in my studies. That is the short of how I got into this situation.\nHowever, from the first session she started breaking apart my deeper rooted problems and got me to talk about many things I have never shared before. Initially I went once a week and was happy to go but I was content with the frequency but this woman is so amazing that she organized a transfer to a more optimal psychiatrist (which is much better than anything before as well by the way) in the same building (a larger complex of many psychologists and psychiatrist but are separated from each other), she showed regret about what happend in all the years before as there were many times someone should have stepped in but did not but not in a „oh you poor thing“ kinda way and rather as even more reason to REALLY work on everything in every way possible, finally, she also suggested that in order to move forward in a more efficient way I should maybe consider going to a clinic for 4 weeks or so to create a plattform for fruitful work and was willing to work around my restrictive schedule as I am not willing to extend my studies requiring me to start with practical training at a fixed point in March. \nAll this to say, she did EVERYTHING she could to push for more support and security net, whilst also being incredible in helping me work out where my insecurities stem from and why I do not care to exist for my own sake, to create the fullest picture possible eventually helping me find the words to describe the issue/statement I was trying to convey by simply asking the right follow-up questions. (Side note: this woman did overtime almost every session and apologized to me for „holding me up“ to long)\nNow, I know that in some cases the therapist-therapee relationship is no longer professional, but I do want to make clear she shows clear professional intent even in the language she uses(I am from Switzerland were there is a „respectful/„impersonal“ and a „casual“ word for saying „you“, she only uses the first to adress me and only uses my last name as well) and when I am more distressed she reiterates that I can always send her Emails when I need it but prefaces this with saying „sadly“ she obviously can not be available for me at all times (using this as further reassurence that a clinical stay would be beneficial to not be alone with out professional help). \n\nSo after this wall of text, here is my actual problem. It truly pains me when I have to walk out after therapy and from that second my internal countdown to my next appointment starts and I feel a mixture of instantly missing simply being in her presence, while knowing that she is providing me with a service and not a personal relationship (as is the way it needs to be) and of course the extreme shame I feel for thinking like this. I have previously tried writing down my thoughts as they come up, initially only to keep order of things I felt were important to mention before forgetting them. She asked me if I would be comfortable with letting her have the notes aswell or if they were personal only, as I said it was more a listing of „problems“ I encountered or thoughts I had after therapy that I did not think of during the sessions, I handed them to her (already very unusual for me as I would have never before even mentioned that I was writing anything down let alone letting anyone see it). Eventhough, it does stress me out immensly to give her my papers I have found it to be a format in which I can communicate the things I can not say aloud in therapy even if I go in with the intention to talk it but will chicken out when face to face.\nI know it would be very important that I tell her how much I struggle when I am not in therapy with her and miss being there, so she can take the appropriate steps to either protect herself if she does not feel comfortable with handling this or if she is that she can work through it with me. Nevertheless, I always chicken out face to face (in this case it somehow feels more appropriate to me to  do it in this way) and then when I have failed once again in telling her to at least write it out, but even then I can not bring my self to write the actual words of missing her and will only kind of hint in the direction that I am struggling with correctly handling therapy in that way. \n\nI am extremely aware that I am destroying any potential to really work on my problems if I am preoccupied with this struggle rather than handling everything that even go me into this situation, so stepping backwards rather than forwards. Since I started with her (about 3 months) I have become emotional again but am to ashamed to let anyone see me that way, whereas before I was basically in a emotionless hole, I see this is progress to essentially being a functioning machine without anything else. Now I literally have a crying meltdown some evenings when I think it is to long until I see her again or the one time she was sick I thought I was going to die just from how awful it felt (of course knowing that is not true but it was just so painful), yesterday she mentioned she will be gone for the first week of February and I am already spiraling again and am ashamed of it because it is ONE week. \n\nYeah, so I hope at least some of this made sense to someone and I truly thank you if you took the time to read through all of this. If anyone has any advice how I could somehow finally communicate this struggle without wanting to back out as soon as I have the chance, I would be very greatful to hear it.",

    "title": "Does anyone else feel instinctive repulsion to phrases from psychotherapists like “take responsibility for your life”?",
    "selftext": "I know this post will mostly receive negative reactions (like my previous post on this topic), but I really need to find like-minded people right now, so I am willing to endure this discomfort if, among the sea of triggering and depressive comments with advice to *“take responsibility for your life”*, there'll be at least a few words of support.\n\nPhrases from psychologists or psychotherapists like *“take responsibility for your life”* feel like pure evil to me. I cannot express how deeply repulsed I am by such words and how depressed I feel when I hear something like that (I mean in this psychotherapeutic context, as I have nothing against the concept of legal or moral responsibility). This is literally one of the top three things I hate most in the world. The phrase *“take responsibility for your life”* sounds like blaming (you should blame yourself if something goes wrong), and this is not just my subjective perception, as this meaning of the word *“responsibility”* is documented in dictionaries (see my previous post with examples). So please, don’t tell me nonsense like *“responsibility and blame are different things”*, because that’s objectively not true.\n\nAlso, phrases like *“responsibility for your life”* carry an undertone of strictness. It sounds like a demand to be strict with yourself. This word has a clear legal and criminal connotation. When people say *“take responsibility for your life”*, to me, it sounds like a demand to treat myself as if I were some kind of criminal who must be held (criminally) responsible. Such phrases sound like a demand to split my psyche into two parts, one playing the role of the judge and the other sitting in the defendant’s chair.\n\nMy former psychotherapist constantly talked about *“responsibility for your life”*. I suffer from quite a severe complex mental disorder with numerous symptoms that I’ve suffered from since adolescence, which means for more than half my life. As a result of the “therapy” with that sadistic therapist, I started feeling worse than before. My symptoms worsened, my anxiety intensified, and my relationships with people deteriorated. I asked him not to say such things about *“responsibility”* to me, but he kept doing it even after I explained to him how bad I feel when he says such things.\n\nIn my teenage years, my life’s credo was the phrase from Terminator 2: *“There is no fate but what we make for ourselves”* (I can’t guarantee the accuracy of this phrase because I watched the film translated into my native language, but I think most of you remember it). Initially, this helped me, but over time, it gradually turned into a mental disorder with an intense sense of guilt and responsibility. If there's no fate except what I choose, it means I am to blame or responsible for everything that happens in my life. Gradually, such views (among other things) contributed to severe OCD symptoms centered around the pursuit of complete control over myself and things in my life. I experience strong distress when I feel like I lose control over something. Even now, at the age of 41, I feel guilty when I'm resting and not doing something that feels useful (even though I rationally understand that I shouldn’t feel guilty for this). I’m trying not to do this anymore (thanks in part to my new therapy), but I used to have a habit of exhausting myself with various tasks to the point of complete physical and mental burnout. I had working days lasting 25 or even 28 hours straight (UPD: Someone in my previous post called it *\"hyperbolic rhetoric\"*, so I want to clarify: it's not an exaggeration. Maybe it's not technically correct to call them \"days\" as they actually started on one day and finished on another, but that is what really happened.).\n\nNow, thanks in part to my new psychotherapist (who never triggers me or talks about *“responsibility for your life”*), I feel significantly better — I no longer push myself to such extremes, I feel less guilty about resting, and I accept the loss of control over things and my own imperfections more calmly.\n\nIn the comments to my previous post about how the phrase *“take responsibility for your life”* triggers me, a few people, for some reason, decided to start convincing me that I can influence my life, have control over it, be proactive, and so on, including in relation to psychological problems. But I don’t need this explained to me — I already know that. I constantly work on my psychological issues, both with my therapist and on my own. Besides working with my therapist, I try to dedicate time to reading psychotherapeutic literature. When I cook or do housework, I listen to YouTube videos on psychological topics to make productive use of that time. I don’t go out much nowadays (I work from home), but when I used to commute, I always tried to use every free moment (in transport, waiting for something, etc) to read psychological and philosophical literature. But I don’t understand why other people insist that I must label all of this with this evil word “responsibility,” which has an obvious accusatory connotation. This word provokes anxiety, sometimes to the point where I feel like I don't want to live.\n\n**If anyone who reads this post also feels an instinctive repulsion to phrases from psychotherapists like “take responsibility for your life,” please write about it in the comments. It will help me feel better and less depressed.** But if you want to say something in the vein of *“yes, but”* or \"*you misunderstood\"*, then please don’t write anything. Just skip this post. And especially, please don’t say anything about how I should *\"take responsibility for my life\"* or be more active etc. Thank you — I’ve already received enough of those comments to my previous post, and I don’t need any more.",

    "selftext": "Forgetting about the cost, why shouldn't patients consider having a third objective person (consultant) as part of their team?  We spill our emotional intimacies to the therapist who then passes this information to their supervisor along with their interpretations and their own personal hang ups.  The supervisor then gives feedback to the therapist based on this possibly distorted information they received, along with their own hang ups and distortions.  What could possibly go wrong in this mishmash of the therapist's and supervisor's own issues and distortions when providing help to the patient???\n\nI've asked my therapist on occasion - to whom am I talking?  You the person, you the therapist, or your supervisor through you?  At times I am 90% certain when I attend a next session that my therapist's interaction or style or whatever have changed.  And I'm thinking - oh, what input did your supervisor give you?\n\nSo I think it would be helpful to have another therapist with whom one would meet to present and discuss what is happening in the main therapy.  I would want this second therapist or consultant not to be in therapist mode.  If they are, it would defeat the whole purpose.  I want someone to interact as a real person.\n\nThis is frowned upon by the profession.  But why exactly?  I'm sure I could research the stated reasons but it seems potentially beneficial to me.

    "selftext": "Posting this from a throwaway because I'm scared for my safety.\nI just completed a 3 day self improvement workshop at the LAX Hilton airport. It was called Educational Awakening Center. All the reviews were great. Before this I've been struggling with a lot, being unemployed from my finance job, boyfriend left me and I was in a vulnerable place. My best friend took this workshop she said changed her life and she convinced me that I need to do it. I paid over $700 plus airfare and a hotel and just put it on credit cards because I was desperate for a change.\n\n\nOnce there I think I was emotionally abused for 3 days. They locked almost 100 of us in the conference room at the hotel where the leader berated us and yelled at us. We had to make hand gestures and ask his permission to use the bathroom or drink. If you did it wrong or straight up asked you would get yelled at. The first night I thought it was a scam and a cult when I overheard my best friend calling the leader \"all mighty.\" She convinced me I needed to give it one more day and I did. On Friday they did all these group sessions where they played lullaby's, left us sleep deprived hungry and thirsty and I left that day completely broken. She told me this was normal and that it's an emotional purge and we need to finish the class for the healing.\n\nSaturday we were all told to strip to our underwear and line up. One by one the leader Ariya pointed all every flaw of ours. He told me I was fat and he could see why no one loves me. He told me my breasts were saggy and I looked disgusting. I don't know why I even did it no one forced us and about 15% of people just stood in the corner and didn't participate. I cried myself to sleep when we got out at 3am.\nSunday I went back and we lined up outside the bathroom. the leader told us this was the last step of disposing our old selves. One by one I watched 30 people in front of me walk in as the leader told them to put their head in the toilet of the conference room as he flushed it and told us to chant \"I am worthy.\" People were walking out saying they felt the weight off their shoulders so I just did it.\n\n\nAfter that it was totally different. It was like everyone had a new lease on life except me. He told us we were completely done shedding our old useless selves. I completely bought it. I just felt so broken.\nWe had a big catered feast and sang and dance. It was so great because I was so hungry and tired. He told us this was the start of our new path in life and that we needed to sign up for the next class that's almost $2500 to finish our work otherwise we'd be giving up on ourselves. I tried saying I couldn't afford it but the other workers kept telling me it was a tiny amount of money and I need to prove that I believe in myself enough to invest. They were blocking the doors. I felt so pressured and desperate so l signed up.\n\nNow I'm back home and I haven't been able to get out of bed all day. I feel completely worthless. I feel like I need serious help now and don't know where to turn. I tried contacting them to cancel the next class because I really can't afford it but they told me l've given my word and it's non refundable. I tried disputing the charge and now volunteers are calling me that I'm a fraud and betraying them and my word. I don't know what to do or how to get my money back. I feel betrayed by my friend but she keeps telling me this is normal and I need to put in the work and finish the next session to build myself.\nHas anyone done a group therapy session like this and where do I go from here?",

I grew up around a different culture which left me confused and made me suffer. I’m now back in my culture and I’m seeking therapy. \n\nI first had a foreign therapist who was great but had different views (kind of makes sense because she is from a different culture), then I decided to see another therapist from my country and was shocked to find out that she had the same exact view of the foreign therapist and that she was not only okay with sex but even argued how important it was for mental health (almost like she encouraged it).\n\nNow, I know of course that not everyone in the same culture would have the same values I’m aware of that it’s just a bit disappointing because what’s the point of seeing someone from my country in that case? \n\nFor me, anything sexual is a major trigger and I can spend days thinking about how much the topic is bothering me. I know it’s not logical to care so much about what someone else thinks and I’m in no way judging her so please save those mean comments to yourself. \n\nI’m geniunely seeking advice, it is a topic that is seriously bothering me and it causes me alot of stress outside of sessions, my brain just can’t associate how someone can be right if they are “wrong” in certain beliefs. I also have a very particular view on sex and how having alot of sex creates “wasted babies” if that makes sense, basically babies that never end up coming to life because the egg wasn’t fertilized. I’m not sure why I think of it this way but that fact makes me feel so repulsed by people who are openly sexual. \n\n\nOther than that, she seems to know her job and give good insights, however she is cold and distant which sometimes make me uncomfortable. My question is, have you ever had a therapist who had completely different views/morals as you? How did you navigate that? \n\nEdit: I’m aware that my reasoning might not be rational to some but please refrain from judging my thinking as “odd”, kindly remember I’m seeking help for mental illness and at the end of the day this is hurting me more than anyone else. I appreciate the people who are actually trying to educate me more about the topic and I’m open to receive ressources or more information that could help me and maybe challenge my reasoning.

    "title": "Couple's Therapy & I had to check myself",
    "selftext": "So, my hubby and I have now had 3 sessions with a therapist who really seems pretty great. \n\nA little background on me, I've done individual therapy mostly on for more than a decade. This past summer I completed a PHP, then an IOP while still working with my individual therapist. I've done EMDR, DBT, CBT...a lot of work. I'm not bragging. I'm sick af, but I know how a good therapist feels. I am also comfortable being vulnerable and uncomfortable. \n\nSo, hubby did individual therapy with a guy who was highly ineffectual. It lasted about 3 months, every 2-3 weeks. Hubby said he pretty much asked him how things were going, then how that made him feel. No help processing things, no challenges, no help, really. I'm not sure if he lost his license, but i guess a few of the therapists there did, right before they shut the practice down. So hubby hasn't had good experience. \n\nSo yesterday, on day 3, the therapist (who prefers they/ them) started talking about why we have intimacy issues. I owned my issues with relative ease because I've worked on myself intensely enough in the past year to know. I noticed- this was about 20 minutes in- that I was sitting in an open posture, towards both hubby and therapist. Hubby was in a closed posture, somewhat away from both of us. \n\nThey started pulling things out of him. He tells all the symptoms of depression but says he's not depressed. They gave some info. I was putting little bits in, but it was really a big pull to getting him to open up and admit he's not feeling great. T just starts laying out down. They said he needs to start activities not because he wants to, but because he needs to. Things like walking at the rec center that's literally across the road and will cost $20 for the year for residents. I think it might even be $15 since he's over 60. They said you don't have the want yet, but it'll come. They said that retirement really can bring about depression for a lot of people. He said he's not. T was like, OK then, if you're not depressed, we need to get you to the doctor to find out why you're excessively tired, brain fog, forgetful, having a hard time with x,y,z. He said everything came back from the medical side as cleared. They're like.. ok.... he said \"well, maybe it is depression, but it's because we're not having sex.\" \n\nT was like \"whoooa, c'mon now. Do you think it might be hard for her to be attracted to you while you're sleeping all day while she's at work and school and you don't shower, shave, cook, or clean and then you ask for intimacy?\"\n\nThis is where I had to check myself. I was like \"hah.. I'm winning\". But then I was like \"whoa, wtf. How can anyone be 'winning' couple's therapy? I'm only 'winning' because I'm ahead of him in confronting my mental illnesses.\" Then later in the day I was thinking of it, and some today too. \n\nI came to the realization that he's winning right now by being given that 1st step and that 1st tool from therapy. I figured it's not fair because I've had so much help, group and individual and self. I've gotten to practice these things and now he's getting the tools, too! \n\nI think it's really quite beautiful. I think he's in good hands. I think I'll continue to show up every other weekend with myself and let him dictate where the session goes. I'll walk with him between the visits and help him with the tools they've given us. \n\nOh, and it's a win for all because he did not feel like they were picking on him or siding with me. That's big, because, as he put it, \"if she's gay, she'll side with you\" before we started. \n\nSo, if anyone can \"win\" at therapy, I guess it's us. ",

I know it takes time to find the right one but I just feel defeated trying to look for the one I can connect with. I felt I was making somewhat of a progress with the first one, but felt abandoned as I wasn’t getting any responses to schedule another session. I waited for another month to try and get back to therapy and found one I thought I can click with. I finally felt heard and loved that I was getting assignments and doing exercises during our sessions with my current one.\n\nIt wasn’t until I brought up a situation I’ve been dealing with regarding my husband’s baby mama that I felt our sessions took a complete 180 turn. I didn’t want to bring it up until I got more sessions in as this is a very heavy subject for me. I brought it up 2 sessions ago and was pretty much advised to “tolerate it”.  I thought okay maybe I’m overreacting and over analyzing the whole situation. We talked about it more in our last session and I honestly felt my feelings weren’t validated. For every situation I brought up regarding my husband’s baby mama, she had an explanation/rebuttal for her actions and compared it to a similar situation with her baby daddy. I felt that my issues were “nothing” to fret over. I felt that she was siding with her and validating her actions and not my feelings. I’m not sure if she’s trying to challenge me but she said she wants to shift my perspective on experiences. My instant reaction was to close off and not open up anymore to the point that when she asked follow-up questions, I was in tears and just kept saying .. “I don’t know”. \n\nI usually feel a sense of relief after each session, but that last one was very painful. I just felt misunderstood. Is this process normal? I’m just too tired and afraid of starting all over again with a new therapist. ",

He didn't comment on that then after I told him that I've tested 12 psychiatric meds he told me that it's too much, I also told him that the school where I go is physically,verbally and even sexually abusive to their students and he didn't believe me and started saying that there are no schools that are sexually abusive (like bitch I've literally got spanked by teachers/touched inappropriately by some of my classmates).And finally I asked him how much years of experience does he have and he asked me why do I wanna know and I said that it's my right to know, then he didn't answer and started staring at me whilst giving the silent treatment, at this point I had no idea what's made him do this (whether because I told him that I'm gay/non-religious and he's against that or because I told him that I have no friends/complicated relationship with my parents(which hints that I might have si)/or because I asked him how much years of experience does he have).

    "selftext": "Guys, I need help with something that’s been happening during my consultations. I’m a 22-year-old Brazilian man, and I’ve been attending consultations for about 2 years now. So far, no psychologist or psychiatrist has reached a conclusion about what I have. I’ve been referred for tests for ADHD, autism, borderline, etc., but at one point, my neuropsychologist just sat down with me and said, \"Jorge, I’ve done every possible test, and I have no idea what you have.\"\n\nAs you can imagine, I was as confused as you probably are. I’ve always felt like a fish out of water and all that, so I thought I must have some form of neurodivergence. However, the only conclusion they reached was that I’m not neurotypical. The only test I can share with you at the moment is my IQ test, which I took during the consultation (WAIS-3).\n\nI honestly don’t know how to proceed, whether I should continue with therapy, which isn’t making much of a difference in my life, or just give up and live without knowing what’s holding me back.\n\n\n(My IQ test)\n\nWAIS-III - Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale - 3rd Edition\n\nDescriptive Summary of Results\n\nThe WAIS-III provides sets of scores that allow the respondent's cognitive abilities to be interpreted through Total IQ (TIQ), Verbal IQ (VIQ), and Performance IQ (PIQ), as well as through Factorial Indices: Verbal Comprehension Index (VCI), Perceptual Organization Index (POI), Processing Speed Index (PSI), and Working Memory Index (WMI). Before administering this test, the examiner made decisions about which subtests would best evaluate the main goals and demands of the evaluation process, as well as to better understand the effects of the individual’s living conditions.\n\nJORGE was subjected to the administration of WAIS-III subtests. The Total IQ (TIQ) obtained through the combination of 11 subtests is considered the most representative estimate of general intellectual functioning. Jorge surpassed approximately 97% of people his age (TIQ = 128; 95% confidence interval = 123-132).\n\nThe skills most related to acquired knowledge, verbal reasoning, and attention to verbal material, measured by the Verbal IQ (VIQ), surpass approximately 97% of people his age (VIQ = 128; 95% confidence interval = 122-132).\n\nThe skills most related to fluid reasoning, spatial processing, attention to detail, and visual integration, measured by the Performance IQ (PIQ), surpass approximately 97% of people his age (PIQ = 128; 95% confidence interval = 120-133). Notice that in the WAIS-III configuration, the subset choices were intended to ensure that the PIQ depended less on speed and placed more emphasis on abstract and non-verbal reasoning.\n\nThe scores are also summarized by interpreting Factorial Indices, in cases where they allow for separate derivations of more specific dimensions of intelligence:\n\nJorge's reasoning and verbal formation skills, measured by the Verbal Comprehension Index (VCI), surpass approximately 98% of people his age (VCI = 130; 95% confidence interval = 123-134).\n\nJorge's fluid, non-verbal reasoning, and visual integration skills, measured by the Perceptual Organization Index (POI), surpass approximately 97% of people his age (POI = 128; 95% confidence interval = 120-133).\n\nJorge's working memory skills, measured by the Working Memory Index (WMI), are above approximately 99.4% of people his age (WMI = 138; 95% confidence interval = 127-143). The Working Memory Index assesses the subject's ability to sustain attention, concentrate, and exert mental control.\n\nJorge's processing speed skills, measured by the Processing Speed Index (PSI), surpass approximately 90% of people his age (PSI = 119; 95% confidence interval = 106-126). The Processing Speed Index is an indicator of the subject's capacity to quickly process visual information",

I've been shaking and crying on and off since. I've been self harming multiple times a day, and just been extremely distraught. I feel unable to function right now. I'm going to miss him so much. He's one of the very few people I genuinely feel safe around, and I don't know what to do without that extra support. \n\nYesterday while at my mental health day program I self harmed in the bathroom. I've NEVER done this before. I went to my clinician and was honest about what happened, but freaked out and left to go home before I talked to someone. I'm so ashamed of myself for self harming there. When I got home I got a call from the backup clinician because he was informed what had happened. We talked for awhile. It was helpful. He asked my opinion about going to the hospital or letting the med room where I live hold onto my medications. \n\nYesterday my answer was no. Today in a moment I was feeling more clear headed I talked to staff at my apartment and for the time being won't be dispensing my own medications. I think that was the safe choice. Now I'm spending the night at my sister's and her and my mom really think I should talk to my therapist about going inpatient for awhile. I want to avoid that at all costs. I've had a couple of discussions about hospitalization before this, but I had always said no before. I don't know what I need. I just want it to be Monday so I can hopefully talk to my main therapist. \n\nI don't know what the point of this post was exactly, and thank you if you've read this far. I really want to avoid hospitalization if at all possible. I also really don't want to lose this incredibly transformative therapeutic relationship, and am now having a lot of fears about my main therapist leaving crop back up. ",

A lot of it stems from very low self worth and a very dysfunctional family and relationships. \n\nI know my behavior and feelings are not considered acceptable and are unhealthy. I also have no close relationships. I know cognitively that many of my behaviors are hurting me in the long run and need to change but on the most basic level when I ask myself “do I want to change?” The answer is always no. What’s wrong with me? I feel like I’m trying to convince myself it’s good to change and i need to change, but a very big part of me is quite “comfortable” being “miserable” and it feels normal to me. I am in therapy and i know this is also bad but I want to please my therapist and be liked an accepted. Sometimes I feel like I’m almost lying because I don’t want to not want to change… but honestly I don’t want to change. If a desire to change is necessary should I stop wasting his time? I keep thinking I can convince myself, if I just see thngs clearly, that I have to change but in the end I’m to comfortable and also too attached to my secondary gains. I thought seeing things would help me want to change but the shame and embarrassment I feel over these “ugly truths” doesn’t motivate me so I’m starting to think nothing will and I don’t really deserve therapy if I know deep down I don’t want to change.\n\nI feel constantly like I’m trying to prove to myself (but mostly really my therapist) that I am trying and progressing and making real change even if it’s slow but sometimes I want to make stuff up. I don’t even know if I want change. What I want I think is what therapy is giving me (without me having to change) and that is someone who at least seems to care? Just watching him listen to me and seeing his sympathetic expressions feels really soothing and I look forward to it. We only meet once a month now. I’m wasting everyone’s time it feels like but also I’m not a bad person, I don’t think, and I want to be “good” but not as much I guess as I want someone to just accept me and let me be… I don’t know why I feel like the only one in the world who doesn’t want to change and I know that makes me deserving of all the suffering I inflict on myself. I know that also makes me unlikable. I know I need to make friends in real life and not rely on my therapist to be the only person that I feel actually knows or cares about me in any real way. How can I know all this but yet have no real desire to change myself? I feel confused because right now my symptoms feel like they are working for me but yet everyone says they are not and I know they shouldn’t be… ",

    "selftext": "Last year during a particularly long crisis I reached out to a handful of therapists and noticed a couple of them rejected me quoting \"high risk\" when I said I have a history of self harm and suicidal thoughts. I originally thought maybe its just cuz I'm in crisis right now\n\npersonally I don't even consider myself an excessive \"user\" and had tried assuring one of them I'm not actively indulging nor a danger and they were still just like \"no sorry\"\n\nThen recently in the new year I tried seeing a new therapist again - new year, new me yay - and the first time I answer their questions, also mentioning that I was on a ward for a week, left a few days ago, and self discharged (mistake) I basically get ghosted. This time they danced around rejecting me saying \"You should try get more support from \\*other party\\*, I hope you find what you're looking for\", I replied saying I don't get support from them that's why I'm trying to find a therapist and got ghosted after that message. Then I finally thought I found a therapist who accepted me but randomly 48 hours later they emailed saying, \"I believe that my expertise may not be the best fit for your specific needs at this time\" - I don't even recall mentioning SI or SH to this one, I think I just said I had depression and autism. And what are my \"Specific needs\"?\n\nIt feels like a gut punch; you'd think people with these problems would benefit most from therapy? I guess my question is, is this normal? What do you do, just accept it and move on? It makes me hesitant when speaking to a new potential therapist, and makes me want to be dishonest/downplay things when they ask if I have a history of X. I feel like my luck is on another level because what are the chances of getting rejected this many times in a row.\n\nI have a big fear of abandonment so my first and only therapist left as well which just makes every rejection personal.

Went to this week's session and T started with a progress review but didn't let me know what we were doing. I thought (based on the questions) she was suggesting I wasn't progressing as expected and the conclusion of this conversation was going to be us ending therapy. \n\nInstead of asking this, I just very quietly got more and more anxious, until I was on the edge of a panic attack. T obviously noticed and asked what was wrong, at which point I had a full blown panic attack and, through tears, said \"are you breaking up with me??!\" (Honestly just end me now, I was panicking okay? 😂)\n\nShe helped me get grounded, reassured me were were not ending therapy, and apologised for not letting me know the context of the conversation before starting. We've agreed in future she'll give me a brief summary of what we're going to talk about  before we start to avoid this.\n\nI couldn't really get a grip on myself for the rest of the session and kept crying and panicking at various points resulting in us doing very little actual therapy. \n\nLogically, I know this was a case of T thinking it was such a routine conversation it didn't require context, and me putting two and two together and making five. But, honestly, I am mortified. My knee-jerk reaction is to cancel all future therapy and never set foot in T's office again. \n\nI am also worried this is a rupture and I've damaged the therapeutic relationship. T apologised multiple times and now I'm worried that I've made her feel bad too. \n\nJust pre-empting as I lurk here a lot: I don't experience any transference, I meant to say \"is the conversation going to conclude in the termination of our sessions\" but my dumb panicking brain wasn't feeling so eloquent hence asking if I was being dumped. \n\nPlease tell me if you've done something like this and how you've managed to recover from it?

    "selftext": "So I've been seeing my current therapist for a little under a year now. I really enjoy working with her as she uses more experiential approaches like IFS which has been so much more helpful for me than regular talk therapy I've had in the past. I've had a few long term therapists (usually 1 -1.5 year with them), but always would reach a point where I felt stuck and like their approach was limiting. That's when I discovered a bottom up approach would be more helpful for me since I have complex trauma. Since I've been to a few therapists and am so done interviewing therapists, I've tried to be a lot more flexible and less rigid in my requirements. For example, although I wouldn't really bring it up with past therapists, I'd get upset when they'd be 2 minutes late lol I also really wanted my therapists to be in-person, but it's been so difficult to find an in-person therapist that uses more somatic approaches and takes my insurance. I'm saying all this for context as I chose my current therapist who is virtual only. I just came to a point of realizing no therapist is perfect and as long as she's using modalities that work on me and we have good rapport, then I'll tolerate some minor things I don't love.\n\nFor a few months now, I've noticed my therapist (who has ADHD ..stated on her website) seems to be glancing at her phone a lot in sessions. It's usually when I close my eyes to do parts work and whenever I open my eyes, I'll \"catch her\" seemingly distracted and texting. I've chosen to ignore it because I've been trying to be more flexible and even though she would be doing something on her phone, it doesn't necessarily seem like it's affected our sessions in the sense she's usually able to follow everything I say. So again, for this reason, I haven't brought it up. But it happened again yesterday...and Idk ..like I understand that if I close my eyes, she may not want to stare at me as I'm tuning into myself to answer a question she asked to one of my parts, etc...and maybe then doesn't know what to do with herself...esp. if she has ADHD...but as a future therapist myself (I'm in grad school now to be a therapist)...I would not have my phone on at all during sessions. Unless there is a client emergency, I wouldn't be using my phone during sessions as I believe clients should get our undivided attention. And if something came up where I had to use my phone, I would share it with the client so they didn't take it personally if I seemed distracted. Sometimes I feel ever since therapy went largely virtual, that some therapists feel they can \"get away\" with distractions like this? It doesn't sit well with me at all.\n\nAm I right to bring this up to my therapist? Is it unreasonable to expect my therapist to not look at her phone during sessions, even if it's when I'm closing my eyes?",

I recently moved to the area I’m currently in and felt the need to go back to therapy to help navigate all of the change. \n\nSo, long story short, I have ADHD, long term anxiety and depression. I’m recovering from a massive burnout spell from the holidays and I finally opened up to this therapist about my past suicidal ideation and how that flairs up in moments like this. There’s no intent, I have my “safeties” and whatnot, but it’s just a reality I live with due to my depression. She was the first therapist I was ever open to about it. \n\nTwo weeks pass and I’m coming back in for another session. As she comes to the lobby to grab me, she quickly and kind of sheepishly says there’s a student here looking for experience and hopes it’s okay she’s sitting in our session, and maybe she can help offer a different perspective. \n\nI was kinda in shock and didn’t want to be a bother so I was like, uhh okay…\n\nThis student led the entire session as my therapist sat behind me. It was uncomfortable and strange, and the student seemed just kinda out of touch. I got a little flustered because I spent the majority of the time going over details that had already been expressed to my therapist in the past. Also worth mentioning that the student said she had gone over some notes beforehand to get a picture of what was going on… isn’t this a HIPPA violation? \n\nI guess I feel hurt and upset that my therapist thought that bringing in a student would be a good idea considering the recent past sessions. I was the most vulnerable I had ever been and feeling insecure coming into this most recent session. It felt really insensitive to bring in another person. \n\nI know, I should have said no from the beginning. But as a high anxiety person, that’s not the easiest thing to do sometimes.

    "selftext": "Sorry guys this is a bit of a long one :// I don’t really know what to do….everything is kind of a mess lol. Back in December, two days before my next appointment, my therapist’s office sent an email saying she would be out for personal reasons until the beginning of April. There was no other explanation (which I understand, she doesn’t owe me one anyways) or any other resources or referrals given to see anyone else. Her admin just emailed and scheduled me in for April. I don’t have email or phone access to my therapist so I can’t contact her or ask anything. I don’t want to bother her anyways so that’s okay. \n\nIf I were more “normal”/healthy? (for lack of a better word), I’d just suck it up and see her when she’s back. But I have a mess of a treatment history, a mess of a chart, and quite frankly I am a mess. I’ve had anorexia since age 11 & multiple hospitalizations/treatment stays on and off since then. In late 2022 it was agreed upon by everyone that we would focus on harm reduction only for me: so not weight restoring me fully bc it triggered me too much, just focusing on helping me stay out of the hospital because the medical trauma I endured makes it impossible for me to make meaningful progress in that sort of environment. \n\nFor the most part this has worked, I’ve been able to stay out of the hospital for almost a year now i.e. not in any immediate medical danger. I was maintaining at a BMI of >!16!< until the fall, and I slipped down a little bit to somewhere around >!15.4!<. That was taken in november, I’m not sure what weight I am at now, I don’t want to know. She doesn’t know how much I weigh either— I am always given agency around weights/vitals/labs and if I decline she doesn’t push it. I am sure it’s nowhere near the lowest I’ve ever been & physically I am still able to do ADLs but since she’s been gone I’ve been slipping a bit more & I’m feeling the hit on my energy a little. \n\nI don’t need the hospital or anything, I have no intention of ever doing another inpatient or residential stay again in my life. PHP/IOPs are out of the question, there’s not a single one that will take me without that ip stay before. As much as I would just like to hold off till April, I don’t know if that’s a good idea. Three more months is kind of a long time. Part of me thinks I am being dramatic and I should just wait because I know it’s not good to see two therapists & I feel bad for not letting her know before but idk. If I end up being ok in April I’ll just feel stupid and dramatic for not just waiting. And if my therapist thought I wasn’t going to be ok until April I think she would’ve referred me to someone else, so I’m probably going to be just fine waiting?? I have another therapist in mind that might see me but idk \n\nVery lost on what to do & I would really appreciate any advice :-)) \n\n**this is not the same therapist that’s been with me throughout my treatment, she’s a new one that I only just started with last year.",

    "selftext": "I've suffered from persistent depressive disorder most of my adult life. It's at the center of my therapy. Over the years I've felt that my T doesn't truly grasp what that has been like for me. She is not dismissive, but I have felt, at times, her frustration with me. Like, why can't I use her approach and just get past it?\n\nEarly on, I asked her if she has suffered with depression, just so I could understand if she truly knows what it's like. But she came back with, \"It's my policy to not self-disclose.\" But I wanted to know this particular thing because I want to know if she truly \"gets it,\" because sometimes it seems that she just doesn't. Clinically, she may understand it, but personally, I can't know.\n\nRecently I was diagnosed with cancer. Although my T has expressed concern, I've come to feel that, again, she doesn't seem to get what I am going through. My initial freak out over the diagnosis was met with a kind of cold indifference. So I asked her if she has ever had cancer and she came back with the no-self-disclosure policy.\n\nI don't understand why she can't share this with me. I feel very alone in what I am going through and her policies only make me feel more isolated. I am not wanting to commiserate with her or get way into her personal history. I just want to know if she has dealt with this. When I ask her that, she comes back with, \"Why is it important to you that I get this? Let's explore this further.\"",

I have been depressed for years now and I only was able to reach for help this year so after being so long in this illness I was very attached to it, even tho I started therapy I didn’t want to get better, actually I felt like I needed to get worse first probably because I didn’t feel valid enough, I know this might not have been the right mindset to start but I couldn’t also get out of this on my own to finally be able to work on it. I expressed to him this from the start but we still proceeded to start the CBT process for my depression and I may have been purposely reclutant to do the things that we discussed in session because I felt like I didn’t want to let go yet of my pain yet so I get where he was coming from but I also don’t think that the solution was after 4 sessions to tell me that I was struggling too much and that there was like two sides of me that where fighting against each other (the one that didn’t want to get better and the one that did) so he give us a couple more sessions and if this didn’t change it would be our last one and maybe I should have waited like 6 months and come back wether to him or someone else. I got out of that session really sad, I knew I was wrong for my mindset but I didn’t know what to do alone, I didn’t understand why would waiting months would change anything and why would he feel safe dropping a suicidal client and leave them on their own, I didn’t even know if I would even be alive in six months so I didn’t really understand what he wanted me to do. I felt really abandoned and the days after I got really worse to the point of programming an attempt, the only thing that stopped me was that I didn’t have access to meds that would guarantee me death otherwise I wouldn’t have been her now. The next session I told him that I almost attempted because of what happened and he apologized but he also started telling me about his character and that he’s very emotional and anxious especially about me cause he has the theoretical preparation but not the experience in my case, I remember I dissociated a bit because I really didn’t care about him telling me about himself instead of discussing what happened but I also felt bad about blaming him so I didn’t say anything else. After almost dying something clicked in me, because of how seriously I considered ending it I felt like I owned the people that cared for me to at least try to get better before giving them a lifelong pain so from that moment therapy started to go great.\n\nAnyways, I think that when I was in that mindset I needed for him to just offer me a hand, I wish I could have found my motivation with him, working trough it with his support instead of having to almost kill myself to find it. I think that is what hurts me, I adore him now but I wish he supported me from the start, I wish I did all the work with him from the start, I wish I could think back to all of our journey and feel grateful while instead when I think back at this I feel tremendously alone. I don’t know if what I’m saying is right and I’m being too harsh on him and expecting a perfection that nobody obviously can reach so I would appreciate some feedback. I would really like to be able to put this aside cause I really do adore him now but I don’t know what to do about this. I hope I wasn’t too confusing and y’all can understand somenthing 😆.

    "selftext": "It’s often said that people enter the mental health field because of their own issues—either to heal themselves or to save others from experiencing what they’ve endured. While this motivation can create deeply empathetic and effective professionals, it can also backfire if unhealed trauma isn’t addressed.\n\nTake, for example:\n\nThe empathic daughter of a narcissist who becomes a therapist to teach children coping skills. While her intentions are admirable, if she hasn’t processed her own pain, she might project her experiences onto her clients or struggle with boundaries.\n\nA narcissistic supervisor who discarded an LPC-A because she is neurodivergent. This perpetuates stigma and highlights how unhealed wounds—like the need for control or validation—can harm others in the field.\n\nA social worker who, despite their professional role, mentally and emotionally abuses their adult children. This contradiction shows how unresolved personal struggles can create a dangerous disconnect between professional ideals and private behavior.\n\nThese reflect a systemic issue. Entering the field with personal pain is common, but therapists have a responsibility to engage in their own healing. Otherwise, it’s like a doctor trying to perform surgery while injured and bleeding. You can’t truly help others when you haven’t cared for yourself.\n\nStay grounded. ",

    "selftext": "Hi, I am in therapy with a cognitive behavioural therapist. I came to her specifying I have complex trauma and want to work through a recent traumatic period the aftermath of which brought up horrendous emotions from childhood, which I would also like to work through.\n\nI have recently come to realize that we are both approaching my symptoms and my emotional flashbacks from different perspectives.\n\nI know where she trained to be a therapist and know that they focus massively on PDs; I've done extensive reading on PTSD and c-PTSD and have come to believe I have CPTSD. I understand how my therapist can think I have BPD or some other PD but I do believe there are differences that would make me lean towards the trauma side of explanations.\n\nThis has implications on her approach. Yesterday she was talking about challenging my triggered thinking and doing reality checks when I have emotional flashbacks. \n\nTo me, these challenges and reality checks appear highly invalidating and dismissive when I am triggered. I KNOW that my triggered thinking isn't functional and that it's black and white and all that. That's because it's triggered thinking and feeling. It's basically my old feelings and thoughts I had as a kid that never got felt and expressed and dealt with, never processed. And this is what I want to do in therapy. Create the circumstances that should have happened for me to feel safe (enough) to feel, express, and process these emotions together with the thoughts that go with it.\n\nFor her, challenging these thoughts and doing reality checks is what I should do. To me that feels exactly like what happened in childhood that got these emotions and thoughts locked up and dissociated and never expressed in the first place - I was made to believe they were \"wrong\" and I was to not have and express them at all.\n\nI tried to explain this to her, but it seems like I am talking to a wall. To me her approach seems dismissive and counter-productive. Also, I got the impression that she's uncertain she'd handle it adequately if I were to let those emotions come and feel through them with her, almost like she's afraid it would activate something in her too she's not willing to address. I don't know if that's true though, but her \"resistance\" to my explanations and intended approach is so strange and so not open, that it got me thinking.\n\nAnyway, does anyone who is struggling with trauma reactions and is in trauma therapy have any experience with reality checks and thought challenging while triggered / while having emotional flashbacks / while being activated? Did it actually help or was it counter-productive? And why? What helped you? \n\nThanks in advance!",

I wish I had no sexual desire but unfortunately around my period I get more aroused and feel like I have to touch myself. \n\nThen I feel ashamed about it all. It's impossible for me to arouse myself with touch, because it feels like other people are touching me. So I read about aliens and vampires and dragons and that makes me feel like a freak.

Not as a fantasy, it actually turns me off, but I think I'm trying to normalize touching myself because I feel so disgusting imagining myself or picturing myself doing anything sexual.

I don't think she would have heard worse from someone else. I don't think she'll shame me.

It sounds so horrible to say and this might be the first time I actually come to admitting it.

Sometimes I just wanna get sick or get cancer. And other times I wanna get into a car crash or fall off the stairs. It sounds like attention-seeking but believe me I’m the last person to want attention, in fact I hate it. Especially coming from my family because I’ve always felt and acted invisible around them. Exceptions can be made I guess since I do get some type of attention from my therapist. \n\nWhen I first experienced depression and had those thoughts occurring, I wasn’t thinking or wanting to die. I just … I don’t know I just wanted for an ambulance to come take me and people to help me. Not counting my family though, I didn’t want them to be involved in any way. However, now when I get these thoughts years later, I do actually want to disappear and not be here. Not sure if that makes any difference though. \n\nDoes anyone relate or am I just sick in the head? Maybe it’s my depression playing a role in this? How do you even go about this?

It wasn’t the wrong name altogether, for privacy purposes, it would be like if she called someone named Audrey, Aubrey. My name is fairly common and not out of the norm. This happened all throughout our session. I thought maybe the first time was just a slip up, it’s happened frequently in my life. But by the second, and third, and fourth time it really started to impact me. We were deep in parts work so I didn’t find it appropriate to correct her. And I left the session feeling uneasy. If I have been seeing someone romantically once a week for 5 months and one day they started calling me the completely wrong name….multiple times. I likely would never speak to that person again. But I am torn. I haven’t had any real progress with her, she’s fairly young in her career so I’ve given her grace. But I’ve started dreading going to sessions rather than being excited. She usually just lets me talk the whole time. And anytime I test the waters by not talking waiting for her response, there’s a weird awkward silence that she tries to fill by taking a deep breath and then we just stare at each other until I start talking again. So I’ve already been on the fence about “breaking up” with her. And this name incident really sealed the deal for me. However I was talking with a friend about it who was encouraging me to communicate with her about the name thing and that I’m not finding benefit from our sessions. Which is the understandably logical thing to do. But I wouldn’t be in therapy if I didn’t fear confrontation. And I just don’t know if I can approach that situation in a mature and productive manner. I also don’t know if a conversation about it would change anything. Considering I’ve expressed many times that I know what’s wrong with me, I just don’t know how to fix. Hinting at the fact that I’d like to do real work on correcting my situation rather than rambling about it. Even the parts work we do is so wildly below my scope of understanding of myself. I usually have to fight back laughter the entire time because i feel like we’re wasting time and my money. So im reaching out curious on what others think of this situation. Am i being immature by not just communicating my needs? Or with everything that’s happened, is moving on to a new therapist a warranted response? I appreciate your time and responses immensely.

I was a notoriously reliable & respectful client (her words, not mine.) I was one of only a few clients who she gave her personal number so I could text her during my panic attacks. I never, ever EVER missed a meeting & if I even had a feeling I was running late, I’d reach out. \n\nRecently our meetings became more inconsistent - we veered away from bi-weekly meetings since we agreed I was doing well and didn’t have much to discuss. Yesterday, I realized I no-showed an appointment when I saw the charge on my account. Turns out I put it on the wrong week in my calendar. My heart dropped, I’m just a naturally very punctual & reliable people-pleasing kind of person, and the fact that I had just completely forgot about the appointment absolutely gutted me. On top of that, I was shocked that she didn’t text me to make sure there was no mix up.\n\nI texted her in a panic, and she basically just said “It’s ok, it happens, unfortunately I have no appointments to reschedule for now but I’ll let you know.” I repeated that I think it’s weird she wouldn’t text me, being that she texts me about anything everything scheduling related —  she called me eventually and it turned into a whole cold, rigid policy conversation about how she will not reach out because it’s my responsibility to remember my appointment. In her words, these things are put in place based on experiences she’s had with other clients. \n\nMy safety & trust in her has been lost. She knows that I don’t need to be held accountable for a human mistake after 4 years of consistency, and she knows that I would never take advantage of her policies being that she has already trusted me with her personal number. There is also nothing unprofessional about checking in on somebody if it looks like they’re a no-show.\n\nOn top of that, she knows I’m in a financial bind right now — and money is one of my top stressors. She is out of network and expensive as fuck. It’s the beginning of the year so the deductible reset which makes her even more expensive. If she believed in individualized care, she’d consider that a wasted $200 would send me into an emotional spiral…\n\nI respect her professional boundaries but I don’t agree with her rigid policy, so I had to end our therapeutic relationship. I’ve been grieving for the last 48 hours. The way she dismissed how her lack of consideration hurt me, made me feel like I didn’t even know who I was talking to. Not sure where to go from here. ",

This is where today’s book comes in.\n\nThe title is “Lighthouse and the Little Boat” by Katie Frawley, and the plot reminds me a bit of the parable of the prodigal son. For anyone unable to view the image, it’s the page from the book that made me use up one of my annual crying passes less than 3 weeks into the year.\n\nA tattered boat barely makes it home safe to the harbor. She gets lost in a terrible storm and finds her way out thanks to the lighthouse. She says, “Lighthouse, you saved me.” The lighthouse responds, “No. You saved yourself. I only lit the way.”\n\nThank you to all the therapists out there for your life-changing work, even if you won’t admit that’s what you’re doing. ♥️",

I've been very fortunate to have excellent therapists previously, so this has never come up. I'm wondering if we may not be a good fit. Can you weigh in?\n\nWhat makes me wonder:  \nSeveral times they stopped me mid-sentence to ask a question that was not where I was going at all and seemed kind of surface level and maybe unrelated to what I felt like I was actually discussing. Several other times they said things that made me think the had just missed a whole piece or part of what I had said. For example, I reminded them multiple times that I worked from home and have for multiple years, and that my ex did as well. These instances came after they said things like \"Well obviously you had to go to work, so you'd be away\" or \"Well, of course your ex was at work, so....\" yada yada. This made me feel somewhat unheard, or misinterpreted.\n\nWe acknowledged that we both have adhd and express it differently. Just wondering if I should give this another go, or if I should move on sooner than later?\n\nAlso very anxious that they're going to read this (eep!) If so: Hi, hello, I'm just processing, no hard feelings either way",

    "selftext": "I went to a new therapist yesterday after my old therapist decided to retire a few months ago. He was wonderful and helped me through so much so I have had plenty of good experiences. The new person I went to yesterday really made me upset and so uncomfortable and I'm not sure if this is just a bad session/therapist or if this is something I truly need to work on. \n\nTo make a long story short, I estranged from my mom in November for a wide variety of reasons. I was going through such a difficult time with it and wanted the help of a therapist to work out my feelings. When she first called me back it was very \"clinical\" so to say. No hi or hello or introductions. She didn't ask me anything about myself or what conditions I have, nothing. We just sat down and she asked where I wanted to start. After a second of me trying to figure that out she looked at my file and when she said \"i see you're here because of issues with your mother and... estrangment?\" She made a face at the word estrangment that really bothered me, it was a disgusted sort of look. \n\nI pushed past that and started talking a bit about what happened with my mom, after a few minutes of talking she told me \"well your mom probably just didn't realize she was hurting you\" and that she \"just didn't know.\" I explained to her that i understood that and how i recognize she tried her best with what she knew but she was STILL hurting me after all this time, even after we've talked about our issues. I just felt like every issue I brought up the therapist was taking my moms side. I was getting really upset by that because I just wanted her to listen but every time I stopped talking she started defending my mom.\n\n Towards the end of the session we talked more about the estrangment itself and how I was missing someone that didn't exist. She then told me that I had to choose between having a superficial relationship with my mom and still having \"at least somthing\" or having \"absolutely nothing\" with her which also just rubbed me the wrong way because she kept making it sound like something with my mom was better than nothing. I was so upset at that point cause I felt like she just wasn't listening. I was crying and she asked me why I was crying if I didn't want a relationship with my mom and how i should really think about that. I didn't want to tell her I was crying cause I was upset with her. After the session ended i went out to my car and bawled my eyes out over the whole thing. Was this genuinely a bad session or is this stuff I actually need to reconsider? I went to a therapist cause I was having trouble trusting myself and my decision and this just made it so much harder. ",

And I have to be honest, this girl I’m currently seeing is extremely competent and very “human” when it comes to understanding the pain of the next person.\nHowever, the limits of therapy are still the same: What can she offer that I already don’t know? A different perspective? A few pieces of advice here and there? This doesn’t get the solutions to my problems. I’m not making progress on any of my problems because of bad luck and circumstances. I’m vengeful and resentful and obsessively think negative all the time like a psychopath because I’ve been wronged. The country I lived in for 20+ years destroyed any dreams I might have fulfilled if I was born elsewhere, and each session I repeat this over and over. \n\nThe truth no one wants to hear is that therapy will help as much as you want it to and for some people with a certain mind, with high intelligence, high emotional intelligence, high awareness of themselves and the world and specific “knowledge” about people and how the world works that sometimes is rather uncomfortable and unsettling, will not work at all and will make them worse. \nYou can’t blame people like me if we are so negative about the world and life in general, I’m this cynical because of my life experiences.\nYou can’t propose me acceptancy for the past and the future.\nNo I don’t accept it.

We have to train ourselves to care less, we find ways to care less and not think about it until we reach a certain apathy towards the next person. \nTherapy is supposed to make you feel more positive about the world whereas I got worse even with the right person and now I feel better by completely becoming celf-centered, egoistical, success focused and tyrannical.\nThis has gave me strength and has been incredibly liberating to me.\n\nMy question is, should I keep going to therapy if I’m just repeating my obsessive, negative thoughts all the time each session for months along with renting about how bad my past and my traumas have been? Is it really worth it?\n\nThe alternative is getting destroyed 24/7 by my justified negative thoughts. I don’t deserve this. ",

Very understanding and good at communicating. As we’ve done more sessions I’ve grown more comfortable and am learning to talk and open up more. But my experience so far has not at all been what I expected. \n\nI went to therapy citing depression, anxiety and mood swings. I’ve dealt with bouts of depression growing up and have always been an anxious and sensitive person. I’ve gone into therapy unsure of how it works but knowing it might help if I go talk with someone. \n\nSince my very first session with my T she stated she thinks I might have a mood disorder. In my second session she put me through a questionnaire and was saying I might be bipolar. Since then I’ve seen her three times. \n\nAll three times I feel like it’s gone the same. She asks me about my week and how I’ve been feeling. I explain what’s gone on and eventually we seem to always circles back to her suggesting that she thinks I’m bipolar and if I’m open to medication.\n\nI’m really doing my best to trust my T and trust this process. But it’s at a point where I’m feeling a bit frustrated and confused. I didn’t come to therapy to get a diagnosis or go on medication. I really just wanted to talk with someone about my problems and be helped with how to better cope with my emotions and how I can work on myself. I’m open to criticism and want to make progress in my own development.\n\nBut instead I feel like every session has just ended with her pointing to this diagnosis and the possibility of medication. Again, I’m trying to trust this process and be open to it. I’ve just felt like after 5 sessions I’ve made no progress and keep ending each session with the same conclusion every time. \n\nSo is this normal? Is this what I should have expected? Did I have unrealistic expectations for what therapy is like?\n\nTL;DR New to therapy. Since the first session my T has pointed at a possible bipolar diagnosis. Since then every session ends with her going back to this diagnosis and suggests meds. It feels like I’m making no progress or working on myself, instead just being told to accept this diagnosis. ",

The idea of starting over with someone new feels exhausting because I’ve already shared so much of myself. At the same time, I have a lot of frustration with how things have been going, and I’m questioning whether this is the right fit.\n\nHere’s what’s been bothering me:\n\n1. **Professionalism issues:** During our sessions, she's consistently joined 5 minutes late + her phone (alarm?) rang multiple times, which felt really unprofessional to me. She apologised, of course, but these moments really break the flow for me. She also asked me to send her a Google Meet link for one session five minutes before the session—like I am paying you for a service. Isn't it your job to handle the logistics instead of asking me to send you a link? \n2. **Blurred boundaries:** She prefers communicating about her availability over WhatsApp, and I find that way too casual for a professional relationship. I’d rather just book sessions through the platform she’s on, but she didn’t ask me if I was okay with using WhatsApp—it just became the default. \n3. **The atmosphere feels cold:** There are moments of warmth, but a lot of the time, the vibe is too casual/ cold. Therapy is supposed to feel safe and supportive, and I’m just not getting that consistently from her. \n\nFor context, we’ve been focusing on career-related issues because I’m feeling stuck and insecure about my skills and self-worth. She asked me to share my portfolio and CV (first of all, is that even normal?) While I get that it’s connected to what we’re working on, it felt more like career coaching than emotional support, and I’m not sure how I feel about it.\n\nI struggle with people-pleasing anyway, and I find myself feeling like I'm being walked over. I’m torn because starting over with a new therapist feels like such a huge emotional lift, and I’m not sure I have the energy for it. Should I bring all this up with her? How (without offending her?)

Previously, I was working with another therapist (Let's call him John) for a year and a half before my current one. John was on a leave of absence and I was scheduled to work with Lily. Lily is very different from John. She is more pushy (In our first session she said she was going to push me). Her approach is very different from John, who is more passive and acts as a guide for me. He let's me talk about things I have learned and holds space for my recent events. Lily will hold space, but redirects me and explains things to me, rather than validate and support my own personal attempts at growth. It feels more forceful and I'm unable to feel inspired with her. When I was with John, I very much enjoyed talking about different lessons I learned and would ask John for his input. Lily seems to give it regardless if I am open to it or not. I feel I have to advocate for my needs of autonomy and enforce stronger boundaries with her. Quite honestly, today's session was exhausting. She pressed on a wound where my parents gave me the burden of being emotionally independent and not being able to depend on them for support. Lily was telling me I need to provide my own needs - which I do not fully agree with. I have been working on breaking the cycle of hyper independence by being vulnerable, building trust, and asking others for what I need to be emotionally sustained. I felt frustrated today and was pushing back at Lily. I was telling her it is not a bad thing to depend on others and there are times where you can't always provide for your own needs. You will be in the desert without water and you must press on - resilience is what I was metaphorically referencing. At this point, I feel Lily's methods do not align with what I need (I very much appreciate John's style of therapy).\n\nLily also diagnosed me with borderline personality disorder after my last session with her. It has been three sessions and I am shocked at the timing of it. It felt like a betrayal as it was not discussed with me. With John, I mentioned my concerns about BPD but he did not want to rush diagnosing me - which built trust and allowed me to be comfortable in our dynamic. I want to get a second opinion with John as I feel Lily's diagnosis is rushed. I understood I had traits of BPD considering my past, but this blind sided me. I want to see another therapist at this point as my trust with Lily has degraded. I don't feel like I can be myself around her and I find my guard coming up. She overextends her ideas onto me, I feel unheard, and my ideas are not appreciated or valued.\n\nI'm not quite sure what to do at this moment. Suggestions?",

And I was sad I got the help and support I needed from strangers , which I didn't want to involve in because even tho I was hurt they are still my family and I still have feelings and memories and family is forever no matter what and people can be your bsf and the next day they gone, in family its not like that. \nAND ITS SO MESSED UP SOMEHOW TO ME  BECAUSE I DONT WAT TO TRUST STRANGERS, LIKE HOW CAN I WHEN MY \"SAFE PLACE\" IS SO UNTRUSTY\nI got into a habit of shame, and I somehow believed I'm a whore- that its my fault. Because I felt like i should have said it before and the funny part is my mom saying me that I didn't \"dress well at home\" and \"you're a woman and he's a man so it's his nature\"  so basically blaming me. And my sisters agreeing with her.\n\nSo I just felt like it's my fault and I wanted to \"hurt myself \" to get rid of my \"hurt\" side to kill my cute and kind self. So I started sending nudes to people on telegram and stuff ( which I already did before and as minor, because I already felt like I'm only good for being used and being seen as a body part) \nBut this time I really wanted to do more than that and really kill my \"innocence\" and lose my virginity to whoever first to catch me. \nSo I lost it to a random guy who I also texted sometimes to vent what I feel and I told him what I was going through, well I got a little bit with feeling towards him but he made sure I know he's not looking for something serious before we had sex so it's my fault anyway, I kinda fell into a deeper depression after that because I realised I really killed my innocent part to a man who doesn't love me and only wants to be my fuck buddy if I'm good with that , which I wasn't so I never saw him again but we did texted each other for like a year because it was hard for me to let go-  but then he didn't let go and it was hard for me too because I was scared of being used again so I blocked him on all platform but he still managed to get in touch with me which kept triggering me.\n\nI'm now 22, low self esteem, low self talk, high self criticism, low self compassion, working in a family business which I hate because.... Well. The title describes it. But at the same time I love it because I don't work at some bar or a restaurant as a waitress and get molested or harassed or being yelled by some random manager , like I do get yelled but at least it's something and somone I can tolerate.\nI discovered my coping mechanisms is doing harm to myself,  I entered a toxic relationship when I was 19 which ended. Badly. I still suffer with the nudes obsession and the sexting / texting people online, if i get to a room with a man - I'm very friendly, maybe the need of being loved so im a pleaser even tho i dont want sex. Im a people pleaser. Men pleaser. I smile a lot to men even tho I don't trust them but I want to trust them at the same time. My Boundaries are off. . I ghosted all my high-school friends during pandemic and deleted all my socials. Im trying to workout so maybe i get a friend or one but its still haven't worked but atleast i have some interaction with my PTS and some of their clients but noting deep. Don't know what to do with my life, I started trying to get closer to God which I don't feel like helps, \nI hate comparing myself but I can't not do it and it makes me so bad because I didn't finish high school because of depression and I can't just go and learn some degree I have to basically go and finish everything.  But even then I don't know what I want to do with myself. Like what type of degree will help me. I'm \"envy\" at the girls who got their shit together and idk what. .\nAt 19 I got in some type of realshionship with a man who is 10 year older than me n he was very controlling and I was very blindly in love with him / with the love I desperately needed from him which I didn't want to lose because I was scared to be alone with all my shame. He controlled me and I think was a bit of narcissistic behaviour about him since he knew my things and claimed he \"saved me\" and I'm having \"such a improvement\" thanks to him, Very jealous, very possessive, very where are you, why don't you answer me? where have you been why didn't you tell me you went out Why didn't you tell me before you left the house? Why do you tell me after you left the house that you left? what are you wearing I go to the gym and I'm busy, he calls me while I'm doing it and asks why you don't answer me - are you going there to show your ass? Take a picture of what you were wearing, he's arguing with me while I'm trying to work out because I didn't answer him and is ruining my whole workout\nI'm always the one who's wrong, I'm always the one to blame, I'm always the one who has to ask for forgiveness and apologize, even when I didn't agree with the idea, I had to apologize so that he would stop being angry with me. When I tried to express a position, he contradicted me. I didn't knew how to stand up for myself.\n\nI want to heal myself but really scared of being that open about myself, I know therapist are here to help but do they really help all life problems? Like I can't just throw up all of this to them and expect them to help me ",

During our last sessions, he told me that he might not always help me between sessions and may just tell me that I can handle it on my own. Ouch. Of course, this isn’t to be mean but to help me learn to manage on my own.\n\nI have a tendency to latch on to therapists because I’m not used to having someone stable in my life who listens and validates (my friends are there when they can be, but they’ve got their own stuff going on too). When I experience this kind of support—someone who is consistent and present—I never want it to go away. \n\nReflecting on myself as a client, I can see that I often reached out too much between sessions in the past (in my defense, my past therapists offered DBT coaching so this contact wasn't off limits). I had a desperate need for someone to hear me, to know that I was in pain and struggling. I wanted someone to make it all better, even though I understand now that nobody can do this for me. \n\nWhile it hurts to hear that my therapist may not always provide extra sessions or help when I reach out, I recognize that this boundary might be the only way I actually start to heal. It’s forcing me to rely on myself in ways that I haven't been able to in the past. Still, it’s painful. That pain makes me reluctant to reach out to him at all, even when I’m struggling because of the chance of rejection.\n\nDespite the difficulty of this, it’s probably necessary. For the first time, I’m beginning to face my tendencies to seek external validation and relief, rather than finding strength within myself. This shift is uncomfortable, but I think this is exactly what I need to finally start to feel better. \n",

But I’ve ended up having to do all the work of digging up and unraveling my past by myself and I only show up to therapy to basically get confirmation that I was correct with my speculations.

It’s quite frustrating. I spend months with these therapists and it’s like they don’t know me at all.  \n\nWhen confronting one of my therapists about my disappointment with her, she even responded with “yes, I noticed that” and acted as if she was aware of all the mistakes she had made… but still kept making them for multiple sessions before I brought this up? I don’t get the logic behind that. Why would she keep doing things that didn’t work? Unless she was either only pretending to be aware of these problems to make herself seem more competent or she just wanted to stall and gain more money off of me.  \n\nI haven’t been back to therapy since my last experience, I just don’t feel like it really works for me. Or have I just been looking for the wrong thing? Despite me seemingly being clear about my expectations and giving feedback on their sessions, my psychologists have not suggested any more suitable methods for me. It feels as if they’re purposely keeping me there just to waste my time and steal my money. ",

Because my therapist already knows all of my backstory and the dynamics, I sorta just explain things surface level. I do explain in detail and they will ask questions to take it deeper but it doesn’t really go to that deep place. Partly because they already know, and partly because I don’t feel the need to. \n\nI guess at this current stage I’m not sure what I need. I don’t feel the need to explore my existing traumas so much anymore, when they make suggestions i either take it away with me or I tend to agree with what they’re saying and it sorta stops the conversation. \n\nIt’s left it quite surface level and I’m not sure if this is a bad thing.

    "title": "Sexually assaulted by previous therapist. New therapist doesn’t help?  ",
    "selftext": "Hi. I was seeing my previous therapist for 8 years. It was my first time being in therapy. My therapist would do emdr and exposure therapy which would result in her touching my knees, thighs, and groin area. She would use the emdr buzzers and press them against my groin area. She was always pushing the line a little further. She kissed me on the lips a few times and would always text me outside of therapy. She said I had DID. This went on for the first few years until Covid hit. When Covid happened we went virtually and when I started going back in person the physical contact was a lot less it was around that time that I started feeling really bad about it. I was married by then and everything around the “therapy” didn’t feel right. When I would bring up the things she did or how I didn’t like it she would say I was misremembering or that it wad the DID. She ended up abruptly ending therapy in August while I was in a suicidal state and things weren’t good. When she ended therapy I ended up going and admitting myself to the psych ward for a week. I was not coping well at all. \n\nI started seeing my new therapist after I was discharged from the hospital. My new therapist knew that my previous therapist and I had a big falling out. When I first started seeing her I was navigating trying to get my records from my old therapist I had to make an initial report to the board for my records. My new therapist and I discussed the relationship with my old therapist and that was when I disclosed some of the things my old therapist did. Of course my new therapist made a report to the board but now we are discussing more in sessions the trauma I went through. However I feel like my new therapist doesn’t know how to really help? Yesterday during session she was asking questions about when it first started and how it progressed I was sharing some of the things she did and told her about the time my old therapist put her hands down my pants and I freaked out (this was post Covid around the time I started realizing how wrong it all was). As I was retelling this story I began to panic and was back in the memory. My new therapist didn’t really help get me “back” and I left her office really not okay. I ended up throwing up immediately after and now I’m struggling with these intense memories and dreams of what happened. I feel like I can’t get my head to stop going back to the memories. I reached out to my new therapist yesterday evening and she never texted back. I emailed her today to ask for coping skills because my previous therapist didn’t really teach me any? I feel stuck now with this new therapist because I have disclosed so much to her. I just don’t know if she’s helping me.  What do I do? She seems interested in the details almost like fascinated? But doesn’t seem to want to help me with the aftermath of the trauma? \n\nTLDR: My old therapist of 8 years sexually assaulted me during therapy under the guise of “emdr and exposure therapy”. She ended therapy abruptly in August and I started with a new therapist after a stint in the psychward for a week. My new therapist made a report on my old therapist and wants to bring up all of the things my previous therapist did to me but does not really help with coping with the memories or trauma. I don’t know what to do. ",

Despite his impressive background, I feel that he was not *present* with me during these difficult times. I didn’t feel that he understood what I was going through or tried to connect with my experiences. He didn’t share his thoughts about what I was saying, and he didn’t seem to offer any understanding of my pain. His questions were often very simple and didn’t go deep into what I was feeling.\n\nThis has left me wondering:\n\n1. Is this lack of interaction part of the Lacanian approach?\n2. Am I supposed to find all the answers by myself without help from the analyst?\n3. Has anyone else had a similar experience? How did you deal with it?\n\nI feel frustrated and lost.

I’ve never had a therapist I feel so comfortable with and connected to. \n\nThe past year she’s had an ongoing family emergency and has been sick a lot, and has canceled a lot, which is understandable. However, the cancellations are often last minute, there have been at least a few times where it wasn’t communicated and she never showed up for session, times where she didn’t respond to texts after missing session for days, times where she cancels but offers to reschedule and never follows up, even one time where I literally thought I would never talk to her again and get no closure due to her not responding and a miscommunication with the therapy practice, which was actually emotionally devastating lol. It’s to the point where whenever I see a text from her I know that our appointment will be canceled, and I never actually believe I’ll have an appointment when scheduled. \n\nI’m pretty sure I’m at my limit for it. There have been times in the past where I thought I was and meant to talk to her about it but never did, and ignored it and kept going. I talked to her about it last session and it was sad and awkward with a lot of silences. She told me that she knows it’s not ok, not fair to me, that she’s working on trying not to shut down and not communicate when something difficult in her life is happening, but also when I asked her if she could see it getting better, she said that she wishes she could tell me yes but can’t say either way. I told her I was considering getting another therapist, but that I was still really conflicted and not sure. I do think I’m leaning towards getting another therapist. \n\nI guess I’m just venting and wondering if anyone has gone through something similar, and how to get through it. I feel this deep sadness and grief about it, and I’m trying to actually feel my feelings, which I think is helping, but it’s difficult. It’s been consuming a lot of my thoughts and emotions for the past few days. I really don’t want to let her go, but the constant cancellations and lack of communication really affects me, and I can’t keep doing this. \n\nI’m not really looking for people to attack her character or be angry on my behalf or anything. I know it’s not ok, not professional, and harmful to clients. I’ve gone through different phases of being angry, and I guess I still am, but I’m mostly just sad about the situation. \n\nSo yeah.

    "selftext": "Hi there. I am in fully adherent DBT meaning I go to group DBT classes as well as individual therapy with the same therapist. I’ve been seeing her since August and she has cancelled multiple times mostly because of sickness; “the bug that’s going around”, a stomach bug, a cold etc. I thought fair enough, therapists get sick too so I’ve been incredibly patient and understanding. I was hoping the new year would be different but I’ve only had one session since Dec 17th and she cancelled today’s session due to a “stomach bug.” She always cancels same day of the appointment and never offers a reschedule for the same week. When I got the text from the receptionist this morning that she was cancelling it was the straw that broke the camel’s back. I replied very politely and said,\n\n“I’m sorry to hear that X is out sick, again. Unfortunately, due to the inconsistency with sessions, i.e. frequent cancellations I can no longer continue this therapeutic relationship. \nI hope X is feeling better soon.”\n\nThe receptionist immediately replied and said she understood and would let X know. I look in the app and my future appointments were immediately removed. Haven’t heard anything from the actual therapist herself.\n\nI just needed to vent and am looking for some support. I was so patient and understanding and I feel like I just got taken advantage of. Part of me thinks the frequent cancellations were on purpose so they could force me out since there’s lots of criteria on their end they have to meet in order to terminate me.\n\nAny words of encouragement appreciated.\nThanks\n",

    "title": "Are my expectations with therapy unrealistic??",
    "selftext": "I've been working with my current therapist for almost exactly 1 year. My reason for being in therapy is both me dealing with a lot of childhood trauma and my last relationship involved my boyfriend falling into a heroin addiction where he then cheated on me, I left the relationship but still stayed in his life trying my best to save his life without destroying mine, and then he eventually committed suicide (not via drugs). My therapist is a trauma therapist who specializes in PTSD. My ex’s suicide was in October 2023. I ended up being diagnosed with PTSD and it has been a LONG road for my mental health. Over the summer I started getting the impression from my therapist that she felt I wasn’t trying hard enough and it was triggering me. I brought this up to her (which… was fucking hard for me to do) and she took it well which I was happy about. In December she let me know that my insurance was auditing some of my records, which I honestly wish she never told me about. Eventually this insurance company ended up auditing all of her records for every patient she had with them, not just for me. I know I have made tremendous gains with my mental health but I also have a lot of work to do. I was surprised to hear my therapist say that my insurance was going to want to know why I was still going to therapy when it wasn’t helping as I was still not where I wanted to be and that it is very unusual for someone to be in therapy this long. Which… I know people who have been in therapy for years so I was confused. Especially when I am having to reprogram my entire childhood while also grieving a loss to suicide and dealing with PTSD.  I also don’t know why she thinks I am not doing better. I know I am doing better but I still have hard days and some very hard days. But whenever I bring up these hard days I feel like she just gets mad at me like I should be handling them myself and maybe I am making her look bad? Last week she told me that she was going to start using an AI program which records the sessions to generate notes (this is because of this audit she got). I expressed concern with it and she told me she wouldn’t do it that session and to look up the program. While this program is supposed to be HIPAA compliant and the recordings destroyed, I just don’t feel comfortable with it. I had my last session this past Monday and I went into that session already not in the best headspace and really wanted to talk about how my anxiety that had been spiking up. She asked about this recording thing and I told her I wasn’t comfortable with it. She wasn’t happy with that. But am I not supposed to feel more comfortable expressing my boundaries? This is literally something I have been working on with her. She ended up saying “well I do still have to take notes and your phone is recording you anyways. Hopefully your new insurance company doesn’t question your need for therapy” Um… okay.. So I talked about said bad head space which I guess was wrong and I am only supposed to talk about positive things so I can show progress. During the session, I felt like she was belittling me and I left the session feeling way worse with more anxiety. Looking back, I am realizing that there have been a number of times where I have had to express how she is dismissing my concerns or like I was in the wrong for bringing up certain topics. I am getting triggered to the point where I blank out or I start word vomiting shit. I even expressed to her once how I am fearful for saying the wrong things. I know I need to bring this up to her, again, but I am also wondering maybe it is time for me to find a new therapist? Or maybe I just have unrealistic expectations when accepting that I have a long road for recovery. She has questioned me several times on the resources that I consume outside of therapy… I feel like I do a lot and even these resources say it takes a long time with bumps in the road to be very expected. I feel like I have made tremendous gains with my therapist and overall see the benefit but I also feel like she is struggling to regulate her own emotions and is taking it out on me? Is there a better way I can approach this? I don’t want her to feel like I am attacking her and I am not exactly eager to start over with someone else but this is something that is very much getting in the way of my progress.\n\n\n\n",

She said she thinks I still have some hope I'll end up with this girl, and I couldn't deny that. But besides that she kept saying \"Oh, what? You're a magic fairy who's gonna wave her wand and make her see all her mistakes? Yeah? Sure, go ahead! I see you've made up your mind, you won't listen to me.\" She even had to apologise at one point for laughing so much. \n\nAnd, like, listen... Her laughing at me helped!

She invited her boyfriend over to our home on the same day dad and I left (imagine how I feel about this).\n\nTherapy: I had a session with my therapist yesterday. Self advocacy, boundary setting, and creating space for myself are strongly implied (Maybe I interpreted these wrong).\n\nWhat I did: Since yesterday, I've been sending texts to my mom expressing my feelings. Yesterday was a lot more confrontational. Today was much calmer. I sent her like 20 texts explaining that I'm angry at her, how hurt and dismissive I've been feeling because of her actions, and that I feel like I have betrayed my own dad. I also expressed that it's utterly disrespectul to both me and my dad. I also called her boyfriend shameless (it was calm today but I just couldn't hold in my anger on this one).\n\nHer reply: only two texts. One asked me to focus on my academics (i'm an university student), and the other said she won't reply to any of my messages from now on.\n\nWhat I think now: I think I've caused our relationship to be strained. We probably won't talk to each other for a while. Not sure how long that will be. I fear that I might have made a serious mistake by sending all of these texts. I fear that I might have misinterpreted what my therapist said/asked and caused permanent damage. My mom is usually the person I go to for emotional support, and right now, she isn't there.\n\nI guess my only question is, did I do anything wrong?

This doesn’t negate the fact that I had been waiting impatiently for the break to end and to have therapy again. But now that I do, it just feels like I’m struggling again. I just feel so sad and depressed afterwards, for the whole week. I don’t want to do anything or see anyone, I just don’t wanna be here (except for therapy). All I look forward to is that session and that’s it. The whole world and the idea of life and living just becomes so much more darker and undesirable in my eyes. When I was on break, however, things were just neutral after that first rough week. I was kinda “okay” and just didn’t feel all this darkness and sadness. This relationship I have with therapy feels almost like an addiction and withdrawal type of thing? Like I always want it and need it but when it’s over I go through withdrawal and can’t wait until the next time I get it.\n\nI don’t get why this happens or what’s going on. Is therapy supposed to make you feel like this? Or is it just a phase (even though I’ve been in therapy for about three years) that will pass eventually? What do I do about it? Can anyone relate? ",

I’ve been out of the abuse for years now, but ptsd kicks my butt. \nMy therapist told me to use 211 for resources for finding a new apartment over the weekend. And I had an anxiety attack. On Monday, I told her I struggled with calling 211 per my experience using it in the past, brought up horrible memories. She then said in response to this, “well they don’t remember you right? When they answered they didn’t say, oh I remember you, you were that crazy lady who called before right?” I said “haha no, they didn’t…” \nBut after the conversation ended, I realized that she had used that language and texted her, that theres a lot of stigma towards battered women who end up seeking help, we are often called crazy. And a lot of women find it hard to seek help from getting out of abusive relationships because we are often viewed as crazy.\nMy therapist got defensive toward me, which I was not expecting. She is claiming that I told her I was scared of calling 211 because they would think I’m crazy. And I keep correcting her, that no I never said that, I never felt crazy calling 211 either, it just brought up memories of abuse, and it felt super unpleasant for me. But it seems like she’s being very insensitive for some reason, and I’m upset she is putting words into my mouth, as if I said these things when I know what I said and how I’ve felt. \n\nUpdate: we spoke on the phone, she insisted that I had used the word “crazy” to describe how I thought they would perceive me. I firmly told her, that I did not use that word. To where she said “if you don’t like how we do treatment here, I can send you other institutions in the area that would be able to see you. I have been through way worse than what you’ve been through” I asked “so you’re comparing your struggles to mine?? That’s not okay” and she said in a mocking tone “yes I am.” Then she said “I’ll forward your information to the next therapist you choose to see” then cut the call. \nI’m just so taken aback by how insensitive and dismissive she was.

Therapy has had a positive impact on my life—I’ve started journaling consistently and no longer hesitate to open up about deeply personal details, which was something I struggled with before.\n\nBut here’s the issue: I’ve developed feelings for her. It’s not just admiration; it’s a full-blown attraction that’s started to occupy my thoughts. She’s elegant, kind, empathetic, and the way she carries herself just amplifies all of these traits. To make matters more complicated, we’re connected on LinkedIn, which means I occasionally come across her posts or updates. Recently, she shared something that hinted she might leave the country soon, and it sent me into a spiral of panic and stress. I don't wanna loose contact with her.\n\nThis isn’t the first time I’ve experienced something like this—I’ve idealized women in the past and struggled to differentiate between admiration and romantic attachment. But with M, it feels more intense. I’ve tried to frame her in my mind as a helpful guide or even like a sister figure, but it’s not working. I’m aware that this could sabotage my progress in therapy, especially if I keep it to myself.\n\nI spoke to an acquaintance who is also a therapist (and the one who recommended M), and she suggested that I bring this up directly during a session. I’m planning to do exactly that in my next session in a day or two, but I’m not sure how to phrase it. Should I text her beforehand to give her a heads-up, or just bring it up during the session?\n\nI don’t want to make her uncomfortable, but I also know that I need to be honest if therapy is going to work for me. Has anyone here dealt with something similar? How did you handle it? I’m really nervous about what her reaction might be and whether this might mean the end of therapy with her.\n\nEdit : I confessed her and she took it very professionally and will continue to work on transference !",

During our session, I got the sense that she might be copy-pasting my messages to an AI chatbot and copy-pasting the response back to me (it was pretty obvious if the message is AI because her typing indicator wouldn't show up and suddenly I'll receive long messages). It was a pretty disappointing session but it was free so I thought whatever. Might as well finish the whole month.\n\nThankfully the following sessions were much better since we got to have the sessions over the phone. It was going great and I think she is a good therapist so I renewed my subscription for another month. I kinda forgot about the whole AI thing, until recently (like a few hours ago) when we had to do a live chat again because some things happened that I'm not willing to disclose. And she was using AI again. This time it was too obvious. Like she wasn't even trying to hide it.\n\nNow I'm thinking to what extent has she been using AI during our phone sessions, or when she's messaging me in between sessions. I don't know how she could use AI during our phone calls but I'm kinda doubting her sincerity now and this is difficult for me because her words have been really helpful and validating, but what parts of it did she really mean and what parts are from a robot?

    "title": "Therapist has been gone on leave for almost half a year. ",
    "selftext": "Hi y'all, I need some advice or a sounding board on how I should respond to or stop seeing a therapist. \n\nI have been seeing a therapist for around 15 ish months. Of that 15ish months, 5 of them have been on leave. Technically non-consecutively, but very nearly. The last round of over a month off was emergent, but the other two were planned health leaves. All three, however, were all with only about a week of warning or even day of. \n\nWhile an interim therapist was offered, and I did use them the first time, the second time the replacement offer came half way through due to internal company chaos. The second one the offer also came late. I also have had expected appointments cancelled day of despite them being on the calendar due to mismanagement of the office. I had serious things going on and the lack of stability was... damaging to say the least. I did not have the emotional bandwidth to start therapy w/3 different therapists because I could not have gotten the same interim due to scheduling on my part and theirs. \n\nEven if I had accepted the interim therapist those second and third times, my therapy needs (but also just my personal comfort) require to not essentially have 2 therapists working on the same thing. Because interim therapy, by their own admission, shouldn't replace the work being done. It is just there to tide you over. But months of therapy is still months of therapy. Nearly half a year, 1/3 of my therapy time w/this therapist, does not exist. That is time wasted waiting to continue doing needed work. \n\nThe therapist is very nice, but at this point their own health needs along w/the managements inexperience are damaging my own health. I know just from having worked w/the head therapist before they transferred me to this current therapists care that I am seen as an easy to place person because I am basically willing to work as a equal team. You need to change the schedule? Fine, life happens. Your kid interrupts therapy sessions? I worked w/kids, I get it. (Yes, that happened regularly w/the now manager aka my former therapist. As in - every session. In retrospect, the mismanagement is not all that surprising). I feel a little like my willingness to put up with a lot has been abused, which by a therapist (or even a previous one) trying to work on that, is a little off. Maybe I am wrong on that one, but I don't think so.\n\nThey are completely unaware of my decision to seek another therapist, and I have never actually \"broken up\" with a therapist. They have almost all ended because of parents decisions, them leaving an agency, moving up or a time limit on free therapy. I can read as many threads or advice pages as I can, but none quite cover \"your therapist has been gone so long they basically aren't your therapist\". Or how to handle the feelings of being taken advantage of due to kindness towards others by the one person supposed to help that not happen. \n\nHow do I go about this? What, given this specific situation, should I address first? Idk, maybe this is a useless post but I would rather just bounce ideas than miss something I should have mentioned. I have had my own emergencies this past week, w/minimal sleep so the likelihood I miss things I should have discussed or addressed is high. ",

    "title": "Update",
    "selftext": "Update to \"How do I tell my therapist that a significant life event happened between sessions?\" \n\nToday was the first day of the spring semester, and I was lucky enough to see my therapist on the same day, after a tumultuous winter break. I told her the news of my parents' divorce in person, and she adapted and restructured the session pretty efficiently. I'm impressed and thankful for her professionalism. We’ve agreed to apply both a solution-focused approach to academic challenges and to process the emotional side of the divorce in our therapy sessions. I’m just grateful to have her with me.\n\nIt was a supportive and insightful session, with her asking a lot of reflective, albeit a little strange, questions regarding family/marriage, my own autonomy, and the parent-child relationship. It has left me in a reflective state for the rest of today post-session (I’m a pretty introspective person).\n\nAnyway, I just did something I’m not really proud of. A little bit of background: the divorce was finalized about two weeks ago. I lost the only family I knew for 23 years. Yesterday was the day my dad officially left the house, and I flew back to college. My mom invited her boyfriend over to our home on the day we left, and today he came over again. I found out yesterday but chose not to ask my mom about it. But today, I was just filled with hurt and anger, and after hesitating for a while, I eventually decided to confront her. I sent her something like, \"Did you invite your boyfriend over to our home? Wow, you're really moving on,\" \"At least have the decency to tell me instead of letting me find out like this,\" and \"Also, how does he have the audacity to come to OUR/MY home the day Dad and I left?\"\n\nThe primary reason for me to send these messages is that my therapist said to me today that if you bury your emotions and feelings inside, they will grow. Only by talking to someone will they stop growing. So that’s what I did. I let it out. I do feel guilty. I’m afraid that I might have misused my therapist’s words or interpreted them wrong, and I’m not really proud of what I did. However, I would be lying if I denied that there wasn’t any emotional relief from what I did.\n\nThis certainly feels like backward progress. I will bring this up to my therapist next time I see her. Frankly, I also didn’t feel really better after my session. But I also know that progress isn’t linear, and it’s a process. My therapist acknowledged my grief today. I’m struggling to navigate the emotional fallout from the divorce, but I also hope that, at the very end of this road, I will be okay.",

    "selftext": "Recently I have been wanting to give therapy a try, or even calling a hotline of some kind but I am scared I will get institutionalized or have cops show up at my door against my will. I've spent some time online trying to read about what I should expect but everything I find just makes me want to avoid therapy even more. From what I understand if there is ideation, a plan, and intent, then a therapist will almost always report you. Fair enough. BUT even if those factors aren't present they could still contact authorities and have me locked away on a whim, for no reason, just because. (I know that's unrealistic) I desperately want to speak with someone or get medicated, whatever I can to feel better but regardless of the way I choose to go about it I can't see a solution where this power isn't being held over me. (Note: I am NOT anti-therapy at all. I encourage people who I think would benefit to try it, I just think I'm not one of those people.)\n\nHow can I protect my freedom from a therapist who is super eager to institutionalize me without good reason? \n\nWho gets to decide what a \"good reason\" is?\n\nIdeally, I could be open and honest with a therapist but if I say the wrong things at the wrong time they can, are willing to, and have in the past, locked people away. Being the only sane person in the asylum is literal nightmare fuel for me. How could I be honest if the truth could be turned against me?\n\nWould it be extremely rude of me to say this to a therapist I have? I wouldn't want to start off my relationship with them so confrontationally but I am super uncomfortably with the idea that any person could just randomly wake up and choose to ruin my life.\n\nAre there any kinds of therapist that legally cannot report me at all?\n\nTL;DR : I have an irrational fear of being unjustly sorted into a \"crazy person\" pile and shipped away. Everything online seems to confirm this fear. Please help me see reason or come up with a way to protect myself.",

    "title": "Therapy feels off",
    "selftext": "I've (f37) seen numerous therapists over the years but I always feel like it doesn't do anything. It just feels so wishy washy and undirected and I don't even know how it's supposed to help. Especially when this stranger sees me for 1 hr a month or week they lack so much context. I don't even know what we are working towards. \n\nMy most recent therapist, we set up a plan to work on 3 distinct things in my life (after she helped me get on disability). They were being able to go out and meet people and make friends, working on anxiety so I can go back to university and finish my degree and work on my lack of identity because I feel like 👽. I was only able to see them for about 15 sessions last year and it honestly didn't help beyond practical things like disability.\n\nI was recently in crisis when I realized the person I live with (let's call her B) potentially has npd (I've known them for 4 years and living with them for two, we tried to have a romantic relationship but it didn't work out so we ended up as friends) because of manipulation, gaslighting, financial control and the whole shebang. When I finally put the pieces together that was what was happening in this relationship i freaked out and went to see this therapist for help because I was so worried about what would happen. I figured I had to leave the shared apartment because they would either manipulate me more or physically hurt me. The therapist recommended a couple of places to get help with accomodation but they weren't even legitimate places to help in this circumstance. It just felt like what was the point of this.\n\nNow that the narcissist is gone from my life I feel capable to go make friends and have less anxiety, I have more of a sense of self and feel like I will be able to go back to uni next year. But this all changed because of my life circumstances and not any therapist helping me. It's always my own circumstances changing that has an impact and not a therapist.\n\nI don't know. It just always feels like the blind leading the blind any time I have gone to a therapist.\n\nI mentioned to my current therapist last year an issue I was facing at home where B said she gave me the good fan and expected me to be thankful but to me it felt manipulative because I didn't even know B thought it was the good fan (because the one she was using was stronger), that she gave it to me, or that she wanted it. Later I realised we actually picked that fan up outside my old apartment together anyway. B got really mad and ended up storming off and slamming doors. So I went to the therapist being like this felt manipulative but ultimately I want to be able to communicate better so I listen to B instead of feeling the need to say how I feel about it. Like I should have just said thank you. I asked therapist today if she thought there was anything about this that seemed odd and she said it didn't occur to her at the time when it's an isolated incident. Which I mean fair enough but also I still wonder if she could have especially because I said it felt manipulative. Like should there have been some flags based on how bad I was feeling and what she knew about me ?\n\nMy therapist before this one I saw for a year and she was so bad and ended up hurting me really badly as she refused to address transference I was experiencing and kept stone walling the conversation or would say insensitive things but then would say she was happy to help me with it. It was really confusing and traumatic.\n\nAnyway I've had other experiences with therapists that feel the same, that ultimately they don't help me work through anything of substance and it's like I'm throwing money into a hole. Today when I saw the therapist her advice was just the same shit, grounding and patting my chest if I feel overwhelmed.\n\nMaybe I'm expecting too much or something? I just put so much effort into my last therapist to try to communicate honestly and openly and I ended up traumatized. The industry of psychology feels like snail oil salespeople tbh.\n\nHas anyone else felt this way and you found the golden therapist who actually helped?. 😔 \n\nI'm willing to do the work I just don't know what the work is",

I’ve had a lot of big life changes this past year so it’s difficult for me to decide what I want to talk about when I’ve been going in unprepared. I will bring this up with my therapist as well see what she thinks but just curious if other people plan their sessions and how/if it helps them.",

    "selftext": "Hi all! First time posting here. I have been seeing this particular therapist for about a year and a half, and they no show for appointments at least 25% of the time -- maybe more. I'm writing this as I sit in the Zoom waiting room 25 minutes after our meeting time waiting for yet another appointment that they have missed with no warning or explanation. I struggle a lot with people pleasing and voicing my needs so it has been hard for me to bring this issue up to them, but it is starting to really bother me. There have been times where I was really counting on having a session and having not just a cancellation but a no-show has derailed my week significantly. Does anyone have advice as to how to navigate this? I did once express to them via text how much the no show issue upsets me, but they just replied rescheduling and we didn't discuss it further. I know I should toughen up and bring it up and/or switch therapists but it's hard! I also really do like this therapist and feel like we have built a good rapport and the idea of switching feels very daunting at the moment. Any advice/support would be much appreciated, TIA! :)\n\nUPDATE: Thank you all for your truly helpful advice, I appreciate it so much! I am sitting in the virtual waiting room for this week's session as I update this -- 15 min since my session start time and still nothing. I have to concur with all of your opinions that it is time to get a new therapist😭",

They're interesting, fully engaged with me, and we share a lot of commonalities. All stuff that I'm struggling with in my marriage, which is currently emotionally dead and feeling so disconnected, even before all these feelings.\n\nI've felt it happening over the past few weeks, have tried to slow or redirect it all, but I realized last week that I was picturing a future with them, that I would easily abandon what I have with my spouse for them, and I feel incredibly stupid over it.\n\nI know my therapist is a therapist and this kind of stuff happens. I know that I don't truly know them, that they're being paid to pay attention to me, and that it can't possibly be reciprocated, for a huge amount of reasons. But I'm so incredibly heartsick over these feelings - I make so little progress in walking back or changing the feelings I have because I keep catching myself thinking about them constantly. And when I truly realized what I was feeling, it felt like the walls were falling in around me with no way out. Which is why I'm here.\n\nI just desperately want some perspective. I don't have anyone in my life that I feel I can trust with sharing these feelings. I can't talk to my spouse about it, obviously. And Googling the issue says I should tell my therapist about these feelings, but I'm horribly worried it will change anything about our therapist-client relationship. They're legitimately the first therapist I've seen who is helping me make a difference and aside from these feelings, I would be devastated to lose them as a resource.\n\nI've uncovered some uncomfortable truths about my spouse's treatment towards me and it's left me feeling so alone. So it only makes sense that I latch on to the next closest person to me. But the thought of losing them too has left me feeling completely isolated and without help.\n\nWhat do I need to do? Should I tell them? There's zero possible chance the feelings are reciprocated, right? I'm looking for brutal honesty here, in an attempt to shake me out of this and back to reality.

However, I expressed my gratitude for his work and told him that I'm looking forward to continuing our regular work starting on the 20th of January.\n\nAnd then something happened which made me really angry and I failed to cope with anger on my own and reached out to my therapist via messagging app, asking if he was able to conduct a session that week.\n\nMe (January 7th 14:24):  \n\\- Happy New Year!

I ask you for help as a specialist whom I trust and for that reason I am willing to put myself into an even trickier financial position.  \n\\- You reply on the 4th day and offer to have a session in 3 days. Meaning that for whatever reason you can't show some flexibility.  \n\\- By that time I have already succeeded in escaping that negative state and there's no longer a reason to put myself at a financial disadvantage, considering that our regular work is scheduled to resume on the 20th anyway.  \n\\- You send me a message in which I see manipulation and offence. Why offence? Because I as a client who consistently comes to sessions from the April of last year and who is waiting for the psychological work to resume do not fit the description of 'So, it turns out that if it’s not an intense feeling, then whatever.'  \n\\_\\_\\_\n\nDo you also see his last message as unethical?  \nAm I justified in feeling angry at him and responding this way?\n\nnote\\* The exchange is translated from Russian, which is our mother tongue.",

That’s 3PM his time. He is in Europe and can work internationally; IPA accredited psychoanalyst. We meet on Tuesday and Thursday. \n\nHis therapy contract I signed said that the “patient will as much as possible try to keep these times (the sessions) once agreed.” \n\nIn later December, I was going on vacation to Hawaii, and  In Hawaii, the time I’d see him is 4AM my time. \n\nI told him this well in advance; he asked a bit apprehensively if l would be cancelling the sessions, and I told him I can keep them, but they’d be had 4AM due to the time change. He said nothing about this in response. \n\nI’d be in Hawaii for over three weeks, I didn’t see him for two of those weeks. However, he was also going away on vacation for two weeks while I was in Hawaii, so I’d at least have a bit of a break. \n\nI did not realize I was having a delusion he was controlling my thoughts into not cancelling the sessions for the vacation - magnified by his contract, even if that’s plain unreasonable of me. \n\nThe delusions are such that I simply experience them as though they’re actually happening. There’s no insight, as I truly experience my thoughts as controlled, such that insight cannot occur - unless someone else puts the helpful thought into my head, at which point I go “OH.”\n\nAs the post describes (in better detail), he ended up charging me a late fee as I cancelled late due to the unreasonable time I’d have to wake up at to see him. \n\nI was already getting very angry (internally) at him for the vacation thing, prior to my cancelling, but again, I had no insight, so I didn’t know why I was angry or what was happening. I thus didn’t know how to act to prevent an escalation or how to communicate, let alone what to communicate. \n\nWhen I cancelled late and he said he still had to charge me the late fee, this caused my delusion of persecution, grounded in the delusion of thought control, to come out in full force. \n\nI freaked out at him over email. I accused him of not saying anything despite knocking his early the time was (which he didn’t, in all fairness - but was still on me); and I seriously sent him the song “Why Don’t You Get a Job” by the Offspring. \n\nThis then devolved further, as I drank some beer to feel less persecuted and distressed, and I emailed him again telling him he’s like a monkey bonking me on the head, and that he should, “Try evolving into homosapien.”\n\nThat wasn’t enough for me though, and then I accused him of straight up not letting me go on vacation even though he takes at least over nine weeks of vacation a year. \n\nI seriously told him in this email that, “You’re like Patrick Bateman’s mirror sex scene, only it’s just you jerking yourself off.” What the hell does that even mean?!\n\nI apologized to him yesterday in a brief email; psychoanalytic therapy usually doesn’t even allow emails outside of session, so I kept it very brief. \n\nI wish he had said we could discusses the fee in the next session. Ive never missed a payment, and the one single time I missed a session (alarm didn’t wake me up), I sent the fee immediately, and despite that he had emailed me about missing the session but didn’t mention the fee. \n\nHowever, he didn’t realize I had schizoaffective until last week, when I sent him two in-depth assessments from two psychiatrists who both came to that conclusion on their own. I talk more about this in some comments on the OP I linked. \n\nInstead, he assumed BPD due to the delusions of persecution looking like BPD splitting, and the thought control superficially looking like identity issues in BPD. \n\nHowever, he never asked me to elaborate or take a history of symptoms. He’s been reading my behaviour as due to a fear of abandonment that I can sincerely say is not present. He didn’t take my accounts of past delusions or psychosis seriously, and missed the fact I was still delusional - a fact two psychiatrists picked up on immediately. \n\nI again did testing with two psychiatrists also went a full psychological test at one point; BPD was shown to not be the correct diagnosis. \n\nTreatments for BPD have also never helped me, and usually cause me to decompensate (particularly psychodynamic treatment for BPD). I’ve been seeing him since March and have only declined, severely. \n\nThe only therapy that helped me was psychoanalytic therapy for psychosis - and it helped *a ton*. \n\nSo, I guess I was also a bit upset about the assumptions he’s been making (again, explain this more in my original OP), and the ways in which this has made the therapy not help me and leave me feeling and also objectively much worse off. \n\nSo, yeah. Thoughts? Helpful insight? What to say to him? Anything is appreciated. (To note, I’ve restarted an antipsychotic.)",

Almost like a fresh start to see if this therapist can hit on anything my current one doesn't. I'm not sure if that's reasonable or a bad idea. I'm also worried if I meet with a new therapist, my current one will find out and feel \"cheated\" in some way. I'm not sure what to do and I don't want my current therapist to think they haven't helped me. Any suggestions are appreciated!",

Yeah. \n\nHi so I’ve been in therapy for about 4 years now. 2 years were with a different therapist and the remaining two years up until now have been with the one I found in college that worked with the Mental Health Provider that isn’t affiliated to my college. At first I didn’t know that she is a de-addiction social worker but yeah she kind of helped me quit. So did a certain someone in my life that I suspect has narcissistic tendencies too. So I really don’t know how to feel about that. We won’t keep in contact with each other till college because I suspect that he is using me to feel connected because he knows that I am a giver and that I have retained my vulnerability despite us going through abuse in our homes but he mocks me for it as well as probably will use it against me as my weakness once we are in college again. I couldn’t resist calling him yesterday but then I covered it up saying don’t call back I just called to borrow money. I’ve stood up for myself against him making me feel like I don’t know myself when I am someone that has made the effort to have a friendship with myself through therapy ever since I was young. Maybe it was to feel seen? Meanwhile he is keen for philosophies so that’s his way of feeling seen. But I constantly feel disrespected by him because he feels the need to tell me how he thinks I should change. And I have gotten angry at him once and I have issues with anger generally too which have now subsided because I have actually started to love myself now and prioritise things that serve me. Which is why I’ve chosen to quit weed as well as cigarettes. He made me see a point that we do this because we don’t feel loved and he held me while we stood in the winter night while telling me this even tho this was a motivation all the work I’ve put into therapy is what really got me here. It’s been quite a few days I haven’t used weed but just today will I also try not smoking cigarettes because I’m actually ill because of the cough that causes. I don’t know what I’m doing. I am interning with an NGO currently yet I don’t feel like I’m doing anything great with my life I have wanted to start a blog and release my poetry/writing into the world I haven’t done that. I just feel so drained despite doing better for myself. I guess sometimes this is life? Who knows? ",

    "selftext": "For starters, my therapist has taken over nine weeks of vacation last year since March (he’s located in Europe). I took none. \n\nWe see each other online; he’s licensed to practice worldwide (IPA accredited psychoanalyst). \n\nHi contact says that clients are to “uphold the sessions as much as they possibly can.”\n\nA session is charged full price if it’s cancelled within 48 hours. \n\nI went to Hawaii last month, for three weeks - just got back. I didn’t cancel the sessions because of his contract and also because I didn’t want to create a gap in his schedule, and he was away for two weeks anyway while I was there, so it worked out. \n\nWe saw one another the Thursday I just arrived in Hawaii; the session was at 4AM my time. I told him this in advanced and he didn’t say anything. \n\nNot sleeping enough makes me very sick; even our 7AM sessions are greatly pushing it for me. \n\nWe then met the last Tuesday while I was still there. I almost slept through my alarm and managed to wake up a minute before the session, and was half asleep for most of it. He still didn’t say anything. \n\nAt that point, it was within the 48-hour cancellation fee period, so I just thought I’d bear through the next one. \n\nBut I was sick all day. I’m trying to get off a medication having health consequences for me, and I’ve already told him that the lack of sleep makes the medication necessary just to not be in agony due to how lack of sleep affects me. \n\nSo, that day we met, I was downing it basically and couldn’t enjoy the third-last day of my vacation. \n\nI thought I’d feel better the next day, but the insomnia built on itself, as it usually does, so I did not. I ended up emailing him canceling for the next day and explaining why - which he wouldn’t get until the next morning for him (the day of our scheduled session). \n\nHe’s still charging me the late fee. \n\nI woke up at 4:15AM anyway from stress he’d be upset I cancelled, and messaged him saying if he’s charging me the late fee, then we can meet now - but no reply. He had a client after my time. \n\nIs that unreasonable? I mean, he’s basically mandating I wake up at 3:45AM to see him via the late fee and took no steps to say anything or clarify anything, particularly given his contract where he says clients need to uphold the sessions as much as possible, nor did he ask me why I was keeping them despite the time difference. \n\nI had assumed he’d be lenient if any problems occurred due to the 4AM thing. \n\n*Edit: I forgot to mention I have schizoaffective disorder, am off my medication currently, and my primary delusions are that my thoughts are controlled by others and that I’m being persecuted due to this.*\n\n*I made this point in hopes of getting insight so I can better understand my thinking (or reasoning) and resulting actions.*\n\n*Unfortunately, I freaked out at him due to my delusion of persecution and conviction he had been the one controlling my thoughts.*\n\n*Insight is greatly appreciated and has already helped a ton regarding me becoming more aware of the delusions I had in this situation, and how that led to me freaking out at him in a way that was way too over the top.*\n\n*I already apologized to him over email yesterday, but the insight I’ve gushed from the replies is going to be very helpful for when we meet; as I can now explain to him what happened.*",

It's one of the first things we talked about when I first started seeing her, and it's something we came back to once again about 6 months ago. My main issues being that not a lot of things really interested me food wise. My list of safe foods had reached the single digits, and even those were starting to sound bland and gross. If I tried to force a food that was bland/gross, it would result in me becoming nauseous and losing my appetite. I felt so bad bringing it up then, because it seemed so stupid to me that I couldn't do something so simple as to just...eat!    \n  \nAfterwards, things were okay at first, but the supports(romantic partners) I had in place to help/encourage me to eat.... kept getting sidetracked with other things, or forgetting, and I've brought it up a few times with them...and it just never stuck. So I quit asking. They weren't asked to make my meals or anything big like that, but just to try and include me a bit more when they themselves eat, and to sort of help me with meal ideas when ordering groceries. So, when that stopped happening, I kept missing my opportunity to order my grocery's or I couldn't ever think of anything I'd eat...or I would talk myself out of them because they were too expensive. Then when it comes to actually eating food(Or in this case, thinking about going to eat food)....I have this constant battle going on in my head as to whether I should eat or not, followed by a hallow pit in my stomach that causes me to dread eating.   \n  \nI tried thinking about where the hallow pit feeling kept coming from, and I think it might be self-hate...which makes me think that by not wanting to engage in eating, its becoming a form of SH for me. Then when I asked myself why we continue to act this way, I get a very loud, \"we aren't good enough.\"   \nI feel so embarrassed by this, and that it's gotten this bad because I wasn't fully aware of it...I thought I could help myself at least to this point...but I can't...and I don't know how to tell her this without having a complete breakdown almost during the process.

I'm 43 now, therapist around 5 years younger. I shared so much with her. More than I ever have with anyone. Then around 6 months later, I was in session and she began typing on her computer, which she'd done before. I never knew if she took notes during session, so this time I asked. She let me know that she was messaging with her kid who wanted her to find out if the pool at the y was open. Obviously this wasn't an emergency. I asked why it was happening, since she works with mental patients (I remained polite and kind, as always). She then let me know that her husband was at home with them since it was a federal holiday.\nI left and then after the hurt building up, I texted her to let her know how hurt I was, and that I thought that therapy time was \"our time\". She wrote back the next day and said \"I apologize that it upset you\", rather than \"I'm sorry that I hurt you\". She then gave an excuse that didn't amount to anything.\nI found a new therapist a year and a half ago and told her about this at first, and she said that she'd never do this unless it was an emergency, and she'd let me know beforehand.\nBack in September, after much debate, I decided to leave a review to let others know what my past therapist did. I wouldn't want anyone else to have it happen to them. I poured my heart out, exposed a lot, and made it clear how much I had liked her and how hurt I am now.\nAfter all this time, no response. Not on the review or anything. I shared the review with my current therapist about a month later. After leaving and talking about it, I realized just how hurt, devastated, and sad I still am. No betrayal hurts worse than from someone who you opened yourself up to more than anyone else. Every day that I have to exist knowing that she still isn't sorry tears me up more and more. She could have felt remorse, offered a sincere apology which I mentioned in the review (I'm SORRY that I HURT you), and the review would have been taken down, and I'd feel better.\nI constantly think about emailing her to tell her this, how hurt I still am, etc., since the review didn't cut it. If she writes back and is sorry, then maybe I'll begin to heal. But if she doesn't write back, I'll be so much worse. If I don't write though, I'll never know and be stuck like this. I don't know what to do.\nWhy couldn't she sincerely apologize in response to the review? I thought she was so much better. Is there pride or an ego thing I completely missed? A sincere apology would have fixed things for both of us. The review gone for her, the pain gone for me. I had enough grief, but losing her, and her remaining lost, not caring about me, adds more grief that hurts, because it's a loss she could fix, but wouldn't.",

He seemed like a total man, in the sense that I was telling him all these emotions and things and he was just looking to fix the problem and tell me how to fix it. I just needed someone to HEAR me and acknowledge the experience first. Like he asked how my Christmas was and I told him it was literally the worst Christmas of my life and he immediately moved on from that to what do I see myself doing in January to move towards my goals. I needed to tell someone about my Christmas about all the pain, about the scary moments, etc. Towards the end of the session I even got up the guts to tell him my scariest realization that if my husband doesn't kill me with his hands, he well may kill me with his words because it got so bad over the Christmas break that I took to unhealthy coping mechanisms to deal with my emotional pain such as cutting and drinking and SI. And he just sort of let me say that, but then brought it back to let's make a concrete plan of what you can work on this week going forward to help start the separation process. It felt like I could have been said \" I'm thinking of going grocery shopping after this\" the way he acted like \" well that was a tangent let's bring it back to what I was saying before.\" \n\nI thought afterwards maybe it was just to close to the end of the session for him to want to discuss it,  but, it turned out we had 35 minutes left according to my appointment reminder ( it was scheduled as a 90 min session, but he chose to do a 60 min session instead).\n\nAll this to say, it was so different from previous sessions.

I don't know that I'm going to be able to do the \"homework/goal\" we set for the week before the next session. I was already thinking of stopping therapy since I feel like a complete imposter and not worthy of anyone caring since my DV for the most part isn't physical, and this session just seemed to confirm that fear.

She doesn't seem to really understand what an impact that has on me and how little wiggle room I actually have. She insists that the way I think can change things for the better, but that's not it. I'm already trying to think logically, try to be differentiated. The fact is that things can't be changed, and my only solution is to wait it out and in the meantime distract myself with hobbies. My thoughts won't magically bring me back the life I want/need, a satisfying life.\n\nShe also says that I should work on changing the victim mentality. The truth is, it's not just a mentality, I actually am a victim of what brought me in this situation and it sucked all the strenght I had out of me, so yeah, I feel entitled to give myself a break and stop trying to be so strong all the time. I don't know if it's victim blaming or what, but it's bothering me. \n\nAlso I've noticed that all therapists I could find in my country (not feeling comfortable sayig which country I'm from) are specialized in CBT. I also have PTSD, so I believe a therapist that won't think that my issues are caused by the way I think, and actually try to understand that my surroundings and situation are the issue would help me.\n\n",

    "selftext": "Tw self harm \n\nI feel really ashamed that i enacted a coping \nmechanism in my session today with my therapist. \n\nI basically slapped myself. It's happened before, but not for a long time. And I felt more ashamed because another therapist didn't react in the best way and it's created a lot of shame in me. \n\nKnowing this therapist, she's probably  not judging me. She hasn't said anything in the past when this has happened. But I'm not going to be able to discuss it with her till two weeks from now. We didn't discuss it in session, because I didn't register the shame because I was so overwhelmed and checked out by what else I was discussing. \n\nI'm worried she'll think less of me. I wish I could ask permission to hurt myself, so I didn't feel like I'm violating her boundaries, but that seems a stupid thing to ask someone. \n\nI might tell her that I'm going to try pinching myself or digging my nails (they're very short) into my palms instead.\n\nPart of me wishes we could just normalize this coping mechanism. I'm really very functional generally. I just can't talk about certain bad memories without feeling like I have to hurt myself. I think partly to distract from the memory, partly to stay grounded and partly because I feel I deserve the pain. And honestly, the slapping starts to go away once I feel safer with the person. \n\nBut right now I'm ashamed. I wish I could have the conversation sooner, but I'll make it through these two weeks. And hopefully she won't think I'm a stupid idiot and weakling and just generally unhinged, damaged, not normal, etc. Poor emotional control I guess? Though I personally think I have good emotional control, at least in how I treat others. \n\nThank you for reading. ",

I did it, but now I’m afraid that maybe it’s too much? Like too deep? Idk, I just don’t want to alarm her and end up back there again. So I’m posting it here hoping you will read it and let me know if it sounds too alarming.\nAlso, sorry it’s so long 😭\n\n\nI hate myself\nThe three words that I repeat in my mind all day long. The ones that make up 99% of my thoughts. The words I say that make people laugh and say “Same”. But they don’t know that I spend my nights lying in bed crying uncontrollably to the point where my body starts to shake. They don’t know I lay there screaming at myself for every little thing I’ve ever done, ever thought, ever said. For being me. They don’t know that I’ve convinced myself that I’m the worst person to live and that the world would be better without me. They don’t know that’s what I mean when I say “I hate myself”. Because when I say it, people roll their eyes thinking “oh she’s dramatic” or “she just wants attention”. Yet attention is the last thing I want in this life. I do everything I can to put a mask over my pain. I’ve made it my goal in life to hide every single thing I hate about myself from each person I talk to. So I try to hide it all. That is my goal. To hide everything because everything is what I hate about myself.\nI don’t want people to know or see that I truly do hate everything about who I am from my looks to my voice, my thoughts to my actions, my words to my mind. I hate myself so damn much that the hatred is pouring out of my skin drowning me every night until I give in. Until I reach for the blade I allow to ruin those parts of me that I hate. Blood seeping from my cuts as tears continue to flood my face. My hands turn into fists punching the mattress below me. I shake my head telling myself “this isn’t me” “there is no way I’m this awful of a person” “there is no way THIS is who I’ve become”. \nCrawling out of my own skin so much so that no part of me can sit still for even a millisecond. I wish in this moment to be anyone in this world besides me. Anyone. Because I don’t know how much longer I can listen to the voices in my head whispering all day long “I hate myself”. \n",

While I’ve been symptom-free from that illness for the past year, severe depression and anxiety hit me hard this fall.\n\nI decided to address the situation by starting therapy. This is my first (and fairly short) experience with it. So far, my sessions have focused on exploring the roots of my depression, particularly in my lack of motivation for school and work. I’ve gained a new perspective on things, though I often felt worse immediately after the sessions—but I figured that’s normal. Over time, I’ve started to see the benefits.\n\nAnd now I need your opinion. I know treating depression usually takes years, but my current state (including suicidal thoughts—not extreme, but more of a \"life would be easier if I didn’t exist\" kind of thing) has become unbearable. I decided to visit a psychiatrist, at least to get more information on the subject. When I shared this with my therapist, he responded with the following statements:\n\n- Antidepressants can’t cure depression (only symptoms)\n\n- Antidepressants are just TicTacs for poor people who can’t afford therapy.\n\n- Medications will slow down the therapeutic process (my therapist specializes in psychoanalysis).\n\nHe didn’t explicitly tell me what to do or not do, and I could tell there was a hint of exaggeration in his tone (which I’m okay with).\n\n\nBut I’m not an expert... Is he right? Should I listen to him? Did he overstep professional boundaries with his comments?\n\n\nTL;DR: My therapist said antidepressants don’t cure depression and called them \"TicTacs for poor people.\" I want to see a psychiatrist to explore medication, but now I’m unsure if I should. Did my therapist cross the line, or does he have a point?\n\nEDIT: \n\nThank you all for your responses and support!  \nThis therapist won’t be seeing me again, and I’m now in the process of choosing a new one. I’m already in contact with a psychiatrist.  \n\nI appreciate the important notes about medication. I’m fully aware that it’s a very complex matter. For now, I believe that a combined approach of therapy and medication is worth trying in my case.",

However, aside from her helping me find the right medication and dosage, I feel we haven’t made much progress. Every session seems like a repeat of the last—her giving me advice I could find in any self-help article or us simply talking about random things. Not that I blame her, I often contribute to these conversations as well. But even when I try to steer the discussion in a different direction, we still don’t make any progress.\nShe uses Internal Family Systems, which she says will help tremendously, but it’s been eight months and I’ve seen no benefits. I’m sure it’s a great therapeutic approach for some, but it doesn’t seem to work for me.\n\nShe’s also frequently late and cancels a lot. Just now, she canceled an appointment 30 minutes before it was supposed to start and is going to reschedule it to next week. Normally, I’d be okay with that, but by then, it will have been four and a half weeks since our last appointment because she also canceled the previous one. I completely understand that therapists have lives too, and she's completely entitled to canceling, but I'm currently in a place where even biweekly appointments are not quite enough. \n\nAs much as I like her, I don’t feel she’s a good fit for me as a therapist, but I have no idea how to go about switching. (Or if I even should.) For one, the new therapist would need to accept my guardian’s specific insurance, which limits my options significantly. I also have no clue how to choose a good therapist or how to tell my current one that I want to switch. My psychiatrist works closely with her, and I’m not sure how switching therapists might affect that dynamic as well. \n\nI genuinely like her as a person, and I know she feels we have a strong connection (we do, but it’s not helping me in terms of therapy). I know she'd be inwardly upset about this, and I really don't want to hurt her feelings. I’m also worried that switching could mean ending up with someone worse and having to go back to her. There’s also a possibility that if I discuss this with her, we could change approaches and begin to make progress, but I have no idea how to go about that either. Although, I doubt much would change.\n\nI would really appreciate any advice, I truly don’t know what to do in this situation.\n\n",

She is now trying to take the kids away from me claiming all sorts of false things like I am an addict (Never done any substance in my life, I've never even had a caffeinated soda....), I am abusive (Never hit anyone in my entire life), I have depression disorder, narcissit disorder, and suicidal ( all false).\n\nIs there any legal action I can take against this guy? I know I'm not the only one. My brother in laws wife walked out on therapy several times, but kept getting coaxed back into going.\n\n  \nedit\\* what’s crazy about all of this is that’s 208 hours only counting phone time.

    "selftext": "\n** trigger warning- mention of suicide**\nHi everyone, \nI just want to preface this with: I am not actively suicidal.  I don’t think I have suicidal ideation, I’m not sure how far one would need to go to say they ‘have SI’ but I don’t think I have. I have a 1.5 year old perfect little person who needs me and because of that, no matter how uncomfortable no longer having the choice to leave makes me, I know I will not act. I am just sharing in this community for advice and insight into my thought processes. \n\nI think about suicide daily. How it would affect my family especially my husband, my mum and my child, the latter in the short and long term. But I can’t get it out of my head. I know exactly how I would do it, if I could. Such an odd way to say it, but I think about my ‘perfect suicide’ scenario daily. More and more. I think my recently starting (3 months) trauma therapy has unlocked a part of me that wonders why? In the past I would have tried to ignore them or just used one of my coping mechanisms to help mask the feelings it evokes. Now, I have started to wonder and think more deeply about it. What does it mean? Why must my mind constantly go to this place and enact this series of events I know I can’t ever follow through. It makes it so much harder. I have the thoughts and now I am trying to analyse WHY I’m having the thoughts. \n\nMy relationship with therapy is still new, I adore my therapist, I’m so grateful for her but there are still things I find difficult to discuss and be honest about. She knows a little of my struggles and we’ve spoken a lot about the more complicated relationships I have but whenever we try to discuss anything deeper I freeze and shut down. I am getting there, between sessions I yearn to tell her everything, I fantasise about it. In reality, I can’t. \nWe are currently on at the beginning of a month-long break while she is away. Despite that trust not being there 100% I miss her and the freedom to speak about what my mind allows me to speak about in sessions. The thoughts of my ‘perfect plan’ are frequent and consuming. So today, I wrote a short story in third person. An account of a women ending her life. It’s not macabre or gory. I write about the beauty of the nature she is in and her feelings of being torn, desperately not wanting to really leave her child but feeling she has no choice, living this way, with the damaging and repetitive thoughts and the constant fear of losing him she has is exhausting, she needs to be in control. Her anguish over the distress it will cause.  It felt good to write it out. but now it’s there and I don’t know what to do with it. I thought that writing it out would be cathartic and I think the process was, but I’m worried I will read and reread it. I worry I have put it out there and created a ticking bomb instead of a means for these thoughts to leave my conscious.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice on what I should do now? Has anyone done anything similar? How did it sit with you? What did you end up doing with it? Did you delete it? \n\n I know I should tell my therapist when she is back, but I worry what she would think, how she would receive it and I’m not sure we’re in a place where I am ready to share this. I do also see a MH nurse at my home once a week. I am seeing him tomorrow. If I told him I have written this, will it start a series of events I don’t want or need even if I explain that it is merely fantasy?\nSo incredibly sorry for the long post. I’m trying to get my head around how this could be helpful like I wanted it to be rather than something I need to feel guilty and ashamed of. \n",

This left me in a void like a black hole. \n\nBut this new therapist was pretty easy going and over time I increased my appointments to once a week, which felt right.

Maybe I changed, maybe she did, I don't really know and it doesn't matter anymore. I started to get afraid that she would end the therapy as sudden as the previous therapist had done.

I felt rail roaded out of her office. Later, I mentioned it to her and she dismissed it as a communication error. That didn't sit well with me. \n\nI wasn't as sad as with the previous therapist though. I realized that I could still move on. And would.

I'm really upset with her for both cancelling a month of sessions and increasing her prices without notice. \n\nHer reason for cancelling was a vague \"significant life event\". I understand that therapists are people and things come up, however, I don't appreciate the power imbalance between us. If I were to cancel more than two consecutive sessions, she would give my time slot to someone else. She can do it without any sort of consequences or recourse. If I drop her for her cancellations, she just fills a slot. Meanwhile, I have to find a new therapist and start treatment from the very beginning. \n\nI'm really upset, and I don't think it will mean anything to her. If I don't like it, I can find someone else to treat me. \n\nHer raising prices without notice is another issue. She knows I'm not doing well financially, and knows that my monthly insurance payment has gone up. Her increase in prices means a higher copay, It's so thoughtless on top of being without treatment for a month. I feel like it would have been nice to have a warning before an increase, instead of her just sending a new form to sign. \n\nAgain, there's a power imbalance. She can do whatever she wants, and I just have to deal with it or find a new provider. \n\nI'm so angry.

    "selftext": "I recently lost my therapist due to retirement that was rather sudden. Since this news, I've realized that all was not well for me in my therapy with her. In moving forward and finding another therapist, I am trying to figure out if what I need in a therapist is even attainable. In March, after a difficult session where I left feeling \"betrayed\" my feelings turned off. They stayed turned off until just recently and in fact, on the day I found out she would not be returning as my therapist, I got my feelings back (for about a week). Through my journaling, I have realized that she had not felt safe to have feelings with which is why they were turned off. Aside from her techniques and what not, the demeanor she brought to the room was \"neutral\" in that anything I shared with her was met with no expression on her face. This often left me feeling like I was the only one in the room. Our sessions were via telehealth which felt safer to me. (She was often on her computer typing \"notes\" she would tell me but this often felt like she was not in the room with me either). Whenever I tried to talk to her about it, she would tell me that her neutrality was meant to \"empower me\". My mom was very dismissive of me and my pain growing up and I'm guessing this neutrality triggered these feelings in me with this therapist. I'm wondering if your therapist also practices neutrality with you and if you find it helpful? Is it possible for a therapist to show up with more emotional connection or would that overwhelm one? (this is also a fear of mine...) I just don't know if neutrality is something I am willing to put myself through or if there is a different way of doing therapy? If all therapists are neutral then I can save myself the trouble of finding another.",

It had been stuck inside me, and it was horrible!\n\n About 4 days ago i kind of went back (emotionally and mentally) to that place: 2~ months ago, when i got home after the hug couldn't happen and wanted to cry.\n\n Then i felt like i would finally be able to cry about it, but...no, again. I can't put into words just how much torturing it is to want to cry and not be able to.\n\n So on today's session, i talked to my T about this episode. And also about all the hug subject. Why would i want a hug from my T, and so on...\n\n As i said (i think) on the first update post, i thought that the hug would never happen because of my transference towards my T. So i had a bit of hope that if one day i'd deal with this transference, then the hug could (maybe?) happen - not in a 'romantic' way, of course.\n\n But as many of you already said to me on all my posts about the hug (i'm kind of the hug guy rn), it is not my T's job to do...a hug. She even said that she empathizes for my need of a hug, but can't do it.\n\nI'll put here a piece of a comment that a Redditor made on another post of mine, it is important:\n\n[...] It’s so special for us as clients to feel safe and heard and cared about, and feel like you are finally making progress when you’ve been stuck, and more connection might feel even better. It can get so confusing. But you’ve got to keep setting clear expectations in your head about the reality of the situation. Remind yourself that your therapist is doing her job. She will never be a source of physical comfort for you. Her relationship with you is her job, and physical comfort is not something she provides at her job. There are other professionals who do provide physical comfort (nurturing, romantic, sexual). She does not provide physical comfort.\" [...]\n\n\n She pretty much said this to me, but in a comforting way. And while i already knew it, as i said, i was expecting that (maybe?) it could happen one day. Not a romantic hug, but a normal hug, as i said to her.\n\n But hearing it from her just hits different. Cause there i finally knew it would never happen. We did the session online btw.\n\n I got a such a lump in my throat that i could barely talk. I said this to her, and briefly after i finally, FINALLY started crying about it.\n\n It was sad, but it was a relief for me. I cried a lot, even tho i wanted to cry more but thought it would be too much.\n\n She said \"Gosh, i'm sorry you are feeling that, [my name]\"\n\n It was comforting, while i was in a lot of pain.\n I just wanted to say that while this hug could and will never happen, i can't complain about anything regarding my T. I consider myself a VERY luck person.\n\n We can do it online or in person, the price is not high, and she is a VERY good professional and is helping me a lot. This entire hug thing was a problem about me, not her.\n\n But i'm glad that i finally cried about something that's been stuck there for more than 2 months. That is it, i'll probably never return on this subject. Sorry for the wall of text.",

I try to bring up difficult memories that I will remember in therapy because I just want to talk about them. However, every time, my therapist will jump to telling me that (a) I shouldn't blame myself for making the decision to go to this graduate program and (b) that I need to practice self-compassion and being gentle and forgiving with myself over making the decision to go to and stay in this program.\n\nIt's very frustrating for me because I'm not blaming myself for the decisions and I am sympathetic to the struggles that I faced.

I just need my therapist to listen and to tell me that that it sucked that happened rather than cutting in with \"you can't blame yourself\" and \"you need to be compassionate to yourself.\"\n\nEDIT: I feel like I have told my therapist that I just want to talk about the hard memories that make me sad and that there is no judgment or lack of self-compassion, but my therapist isn't seeing it that way. I'm copying a reply that I made below so maybe someone can give me feedback on if I've been clear what I'm looking for.\n\n\"My sadness over my memories is taken by my therapist as me being judgmental and uncompassionate toward myself.

Therapist replies that it seems I am sad because I am judging myself for the decisions I made.\n5. I say I am not judging myself, I just want to talk about the memory and share how horrible that situation was because I feel so sad.\n6. Therapist says that I don't have to have those kinds of difficult experiences and suffer in the future if I forgive myself for my mistakes. Then, I will feel less sad and can take the lesson from it and make better decisions moving forward.\n7. I say I have forgiven myself, but the memories are still difficult and I just need to talk them out.\n8.

Is 3 weeks over the holidays enough time to message back and/or fill my prescription? Should I leave this psychiarist or wait another week? It was my fault to start and I assume they're on vacation, but I have not had my medication in a month which was pretty difficult. ",

    "selftext": "I have been having therapy with a fantastic therapist for just over a year and it’s been really intense. We have been exploring trauma related to SA/trafficking at the hands of a former therapist when I was a teenager, and have just started to touch on, but not explicitly discuss, CSA. It has felt really intense and my attachment to my T has been very push-pull: sometimes I feel overly needy towards her and other times I want to cancel all future sessions because it’s all too much. I am currently pregnant and due mid-March (first baby). I am wondering what to do about my therapy between now and then. It’s a slow process and I’ve just had a nearly 3 week break over Christmas so the thought of starting up again and seeing her weekly feels a bit destabalising because I know once the baby is born there will be a gap when I can’t see her. I’m wondering whether to a/cancel all my sessions until I’m able to return once the baby is born b/continue but keep it super light and not continue unpacking trauma or c/ see her more frequently (she’s previously offered twice a week) until the baby is here. I plan on discussing this with her at my session tomorrow but I think she will just push it back on me to decide so wanted to get some thoughts on it. She said once the baby is here I can take the baby along to my in-person sessions but to be honest I don’t know how feasible that will be? For the first few months my partner will be on maternity leave too so I should be able to return to normal quite quickly. Thank you in advance for your input! ",

He also said he envies me when I was talking about how I really liked the visuals of a music video (Heart Shaped Box by Nirvana for context) which I still really don't understand what he was saying he envied in that scenario. There's also this really weird dynamic because I'm a 19yo minority and really into Hip-Hop and the culture/fashion of it and even make some music of my own, and he's a mid thirties caucasian (and there's nothing wrong with that) but he sometimes downplays himself as a \"basic corny white man\" or thinks I'm from the hood (I'm not) or \"cooler\" than him in some way. It's just really strange and uncomfortable. Aside from this aspect of our relationship, I've been seeing him for over a year now and things have been pretty rocky with him misunderstanding me pretty often and not doing too great as a therapist, with us making basically no progress since the beginning (this also has been his first year as an official therapist).

    "selftext": "I’ve been seeing my therapist regularly for the past 2 years, but about 2 months go, I started having issues with her and the office. Here’s what happened:\n\n-Appointment Cancellation: I booked an appointment, but she double-booked and canceled on me at the appointment time(virtually). Accidents happen and honestly this is something easy to get over but it’s just what proceeded after this. \n\n-Refund Issue: She said I’d get a refund for the canceled appointment, but I never did. I ended up issuing a chargeback because I was also charged for the next appointment. I genuinely didn’t know that chargebacks were expensive for businesses. I just didn’t want $150 to go to waste while waiting for the office to refund me\n\n-Interrupted Session: At the next appointment, she was in what seemed like a public space with loud speakers and background noise. When I asked about it, she dismissed it. Then, 10 minutes into the session, she told me she couldn’t see me because of the chargeback and said I needed to reverse it before continuing.\n\n- Chargeback Fee: I reversed the chargeback because I was anxious and just wanted to continue therapy, but then they added a $50 fee.\n\n-  Office Issues: I emailed the office to express my frustrations about how this was handled. They deflected, didn’t answer my questions, and outright denied that my appointment had been interrupted. They also sent rude and dismissive emails, blaming my therapist for everything.\n\n-Therapist not addressing: I messaged my therapist about these issues, but she only gave a generic response and didn’t acknowledge any of my concerns.\n\n-Ending Therapy: After a month of dealing with this, I decided to discontinue therapy. When I emailed to explain my reasons thanking her but also outlining my frustrations with the treatment I received—I finally got a refund.\nHer response? A short, generic email:\n\n\"I appreciate you letting me know your intentions. I have enjoyed working with you, and I wish you nothing but the best moving forward.\"\nAfter 2 years of therapy, I feel so dismissed and devalued. The whole experience has left me frustrated and hurt. I feel like if they would’ve at least apologized and held some accountability I would not feel this bad. It makes me feel like I did something wrong. I also have spent over $7500 total at this practice. Has anyone else dealt with something like this?

    "title": "Many Ruptures in a Row? ",
    "selftext": "Lately, it feels harder to trust my therapist because we had a surprise near-month long break. She got sick and cancelled the session right before holiday break, and forgot to tell me when her break actually was. I don’t blame her for getting sick at all, she’s human! Shit happens! I’m more upset about how it was handled afterwards.\n\nWhen she cancelled, she let me know that she would email me to let me know about her break, and when she would be in office over the break. Before this happened, she had mentioned a date she was thinking of being in office around the holidays to provide extra support. However, in her email, that date changed to a week later, prolonging this already 3 week long surprise break. She did not include any details about her break. This email also came delayed, and just one hour before she actually went on break. So, when I responded, I immediately received an automated email informing me that she was already out of office and would not be checking her email except for during “very limited in-office hours”. That’s how I discovered when she would be on break. It came sooner than anticipated without any preparation, and it felt like a punch in the gut. For a while, we had absolutely nothing scheduled, let alone rescheduled. \n\nFor the record, I totally understand that she needs and deserves a break!! I normally do not email her over breaks at all. Part of the reason I’ve been so hesitant to bring any of this up is because I didn’t want to bombard her email over break. She wouldn’t be checking it anyway! I do think a lot of this can be chalked up to poor timing. I can’t entirely blame her for that. However, I’m not seeing much being done to clean up the mess.  \n\nShe did eventually respond, and after two weeks of not knowing if we would ever meet again, I was able to schedule for that later in-office time over break. This appointment was a couple of days ago. During it, she didn’t even mention the break or cancelling. She just asked about how I am, as if nothing happened. I never got a chance to bring it up because a) I’m chicken and b) she somehow mixed up my time, and accidentally ended that session early. She did acknowledge and apologize for ending the session early via email after the appointment, but on top of everything else, it still stings. \n\nShe knew things have been extra hard the past couple of months, and she had said she wanted to give me the extra support I need. Before this all happened, she had scheduled an emergency session with me (cancelled) and offered that additional in-office date during break. But then she cancels, disappears on break, delays rescheduling, and schedules differently than what I had originally been told. Then, when I first return, she doesn’t acknowledge anything and rushes me out… \n\nAdditionally, our weekly schedule for this new year is now in cahoots because of the lapse in communication. While I was waiting for her to get back to me, a job opportunity came up, and I didn’t want to risk missing it. Little did I know, it would conflict with the time she had carved out for me. Had I known earlier, I would have scheduled differently! I probably can move my job schedule around, but that adds more stress to this mess because I hate letting people down. She did not apologize for the scheduling issue, she just stated she does not really have any other weekly times right now. So, the ball in now in my court. \n\nOverall, I am feeling really forgotten. I feel as though I was given false hope that I would get support while I have arguably, been at one of my lowest points. I also feel like I’m being left to pick up her slack. She has not really been following through lately, and I don’t know how to go about this. I don’t know what changed either! I’ve been seeing her for four years now, and she’s been so wonderful, but now it’s as though she’s too busy for me. I know this may not be true, but it seems almost as if she scheduled everyone else before me.\n\nIt’s already incredibly hard for me to trust opening up to people given my history of complex trauma compounded with negative experiences from previous mental health practitioners. My previous therapist before this one actually ghosted me, and it took me a while to try therapy again. It took me even longer to trust my current therapist enough to really open up. She is aware of this. She is also aware that I recently had a rupture with my current psychiatrist as well. It just really sucks because I felt as though I was finally starting to really trust this therapist, and now kaboom!! While I’m already at my worst, and right after a rupture with my psychiatrist. 🫠\n\nHowever maladaptive it may be, I am so very tempted to avoid this, put up a wall, and give up on mental health treatment altogether. At the same time, I know that calling it quits will further hinder whatever ability I still have to trust anyone. I also know that I don’t have it in me to start all over with someone new right now. That sounds exhausting. \n\nBut, I don’t know what to do or say, and I don’t know where to start. The issues compounded quickly and the break already allowed them to fester. Can the trust be restored? I also feel guilty for even being upset at all, because she is allowed to take breaks and take care of herself when she is sick. I want her to! That’s not the problem!!",

Now, I just choose to not even open her messages since they are still so long. She also displays a lot of concern for me during our sessions, which can be a bit uncomfortable -maybe its just me. Honestly, I just settled w her because I was fearful that I was wasting time and money looking for a therapist. Our sessions are productive only sometimes. My friend said that I can tell my therapist what I want more or less of and I tried, but she see’s it as resistance and me trying to tell her how to do her work. I am afraid that if I switch therapist’s I might not find one as flexible as her -she is pretty flexible w the time of our individual sessions and I even see her in a couples session. \n\nIf this is her “typical “ practice I fear that it hinders my therapeutic progression. \n\nHow can I set a boundary w her and keep our relationship strictly professional?\n\nCan I tell her how to conduct herself w me? Should I worry about hurting her feelings?",

My insurance doesn't cover good therapy only bad CBT/DBT. I will scream if another therapist tries to use these techniques on me. I hate it with ever fiber of my being. It is absolutely useless therapy to me. I also only am getting therapist in training who literally don't know anything about trauma+Autism and other things I have. They generally break boundaries with me routinely and I end up leaving. I'm now leaving sooner. I give them two sessions that's it now. But I am tired yo. I am having intense trust issues and actually trauma too from therapists. I find I cannot trust most humans at al anymore. I am retreating back into video games and smoking and I just kind of don't feel like I want to try anymore. When I have asked for help people say try psychology today and etc. Yo I've tried that for awhile its not working. My insurance is Medi-CAL and I have no income. I dont have anyone who can pay for me either. I don't have anyway to get private therapy. I do not. SO please don't say sliding scale because that won't work since I have literally no income. I am disabled and waiting on 4th time with judge for SSDI. I won't know if I get it this time or not. If I don't I don't know what else to do excpet to sue the state at that point and I will. I have no other choice. I have Autism+ADHD as well as medical issues and complex trauma. \n\nAs for finding a therapist I've called a lot of places and they don't offer anything as well as saying to google it. I'm like Autistic I can't google shit. I can't find anything. I'm overwhelmed and I've had past attempts as well as SH. I will not go inpatient or whatever. I don't think that will help me because they are incompentent like the therapists and will cause me more trauma and pain.\n\nSo what are people's recommendations?\n\n",

    "selftext": "Before anyone thinks that \"oh the therapist agreed with me, therefore I won\" no. \n\nI've had a therapist of some sort for the better part of the past decade. I needed support before, and now I'm being challenged and doing a lot of growing and discovery. \n\nI realize not everyone is ready for therapy at all, much less to really tackle trauma and get into hard work. It took me awhile to get there. So I'm not judging my spouse for their lack of going. \n\nBut, after 14 years of marriage, we ended up in therapy as a couple. I admitted some things in our intake session that the therapist called me out on and I took it to heart. I took it to my individual therapist and we worked on some stuff. My partner was a bit less expressive, though participatory. \n\nBut at today's session (only #2), this new- to- us therapist was throwing some great stuff at us. I was really feeling the whole thing. And I let my spouse go when they were opening up about childhood things (that I can see affect his relationship with me but I'm not sure he can yet) and he was really doing the whole therapy thing. It wasn't just a \"I'll go along for the sake of the marriage\" thing. \n\nSo at the end, I asked my partner of 21 years, spouse of 14, if he'd feel comfortable seeing them (therapist's preferred pronouns) individually. They said they can do that, but it would require new intake paperwork and they have to talk to the admin about getting that set up, and the 3 of us would have to sit down again and talk about it first. \n\nNot gonna lie, I'm thinking about seeing them individually, too. I've seen someone from the same practice individually (it's a sex and intimacy practice) as well as my usual long-term therapist - we do a mix of talk and EMDR. But, maybe it was just the dynamic of the room from today's session, but this therapist was 🔥 and I'm like \"I... think I feel it more with you. \"\n\nBut honestly, even if i don't change anything for myself, the fact that my spouse was not coerced at all and said, \"yeah, I like you. You're easy to talk to and I like the way you say things\". That made my damn week! \n\nI'm not trying to be a 🍆 when I say \"you need therapy, too\" because he's so stuck with the wicked things his mother said and did to him, and even though she's been gone some 11 years, it is stunting his growth and keeping him in a painful place. \n\nLISW for the win.

    "title": "Yelled at by former therapist in 2019 after showing up disregulated to a session, still unpacking this today",
    "selftext": "In 2019, I got yelled at by a construction worker on my bike while biking to my therapy session that day. It was sort of my fault, since I should have seen the construction coming and stopped well in advance of it. I sort of kept biking towards it which angered the worker. But I got super upset and agitated immediately after this incident.\n\nI then proceeded to show up to my appointment very disregulated and upset, and my therapist actually got really seemingly annoyed with me. It was very different from our prior sessions. Her tone of voice was not normal, and if anything, she raised her voice. She kept going on and on saying different things and expressions about how I was handling the situation, and it didn’t even make much sense, and definitely didn’t seem very receptive to how I was reacting to her. I think she yelled at me honestly. The session ended at our usual end time, but she basically had been rambling up until that point, and then it ended very awkwardly.\n\nWhat I will also say is that although I had benefitted from this therapist up to this point, I didn’t really click with her in conversation and I found her to be actually a bit scary at times (even before this incident which was very, VERY scary). I only kept seeing her because I had been involuntarily admitted to a hospital for a 72-hour hold a year prior for suicidal ideation. Before that hospital admission, I had tried and failed to find a therapist, because most in my area were not taking new patients and my university had a very poor referral system with limited options.\n\nExactly one week later (still in 2019, to be clear), I got the cops called on me again for making statements that were interpreted as suicidal ideation. This time I was not admitted to the hospital, precisely because I was seeing a therapist. I recently (in 2024) went back through old chatlogs and figured out that this happened one week after the really bad session (I guess I didn’t remember the connection between this bad session and the ideation symptoms at the time?). I saw her biweekly, and I don’t think I even discussed the ideation with her at my subsequent session, but I do remember that she was nice to me and back to her “normal” self in that session (which was still a bit scary but not like it was in the bad session).\n\nI just can’t believe it. My old therapist literally aggravated my suicidal ideation in 2019.\n\nTo be clear: I haven’t had any suicidal ideation at all since finding a better therapist in 2020 (and an even better therapist in 2022-now). \n\nWhat, clinically, happened here? Was this a rupture? I’ve been discussing the incident with my current therapist which has been very useful. Has anything like this happened to anyone else? I wish I had confronted that first therapist and let me know how that session made me feel. I was so scared of her that I avoided any such discussion out of fear she would lash out at me.\n",

    "selftext": "I started doing therapy a year ago with my first therapist, and we were five sessions in before I told her I didn't think therapy was working for me. I struggled with anxiety issues (generalized anxiety disorder) and some mild depression issues. I asked why we hadn't done CBT earlier as we are in our fifth session and I felt like what we were doing wasn't helpful. I told her when I asked her a question, I wanted her to give me an answer. I understand therapy is different in some ways for women, they usually need to talk things out to process, as a man I need a logical and structured response. Often when I would leave therapy I would leave more anxious and frustrated then when I entered. My therapist told me that I was supposed to figure out the answers to my questions and not her answering them. I told her I would revisit therapy in two months, and when I reached out to her two months later, she told me she didn't think we would be a good fit. I appreciate her not dragging on and letting me go as a client.\n\nMy second therapist I reached out in May of 2024, and I was able to get in the same week. He was a retired man in his early 70's, and had many of the same issues earlier in his life (I am a man in my early 20s.) Lots of my issues surrounding anxiety and mild depression were related to obsessive compulsive personality disorder. My therapist did not tell me this, and I found out that OCPD existed in November of 2024). I struggled with rigidity, living off of my lists, the constant need for control, and perfectionism issues. I told my therapist my to-do lists were in the thousands and I needed a solution to resolve this problem. I was having problems at work as well and received a negative performance review. I felt great shame because of this. 6 months into therapy I was doing better - but because I researched DBT and ACT as a solution to my OCPD. I found the work of Gary Trosclair regarding harnessing the compulsive personality. It has been 8 months of therapy and I have had no real help regarding OCPD in the form of DBT. Therefore, I am a bit frustrated with my therapist for not finding this problem when I made bright red flags clear to him. \n\nMy therapist doesn't seem to understand OCPD, and has only used CBT as a solution. He has also recommended many books, some of which he has not read himself. They were still good books, but I want more of his opinions on solutions-based therapy and problem solving strategies. I realize I will have to do this on my own - and then I realize I don't need therapy. I have friends and family that are willing to talk to me about my issues, but I really need a professional to discuss my strategy with me. The DBT forums here have amazing information that have really helped me with perfectionism, more than my therapist could provide. However, with my therapist I see no end to therapy. This summer he wouldn't book me once a week when I was really struggling with anxiety. However in October he admitted he doesn't have a lot of clients around holidays - so inadvertently he was more willing to book me once a week. I feel like I may be done with therapy but he won't honestly tell me whether I am done or not. He asked how I was on a scale of 1-10 and I said 5. he also said I was picking up material better than many of his clients. Granted, I have never lost a parent, child, been in a divorce, or lost a relationship I cared about. Sometimes when I ask questions as well, he won't answer them like my prior therapist and it gets frustrating. I have to re-ask three times to get a roundabout answer. There are days where he will rant about politics - and there are days he spends an extra half hour with me to discuss issues and doesn't bill my insurance for more. I understand that no therapist is perfect.\n\nShould I continue to see this therapist? I feel like I have the knowledge now that I need, and better emotional control - but I don't want to waste any more time in therapy. I have read the books he has given me - but I would think a dozen books isn't the solution to my problems. I am thinking I can handle these issues on my own because my therapist's opinions are not working. I am busy with work, busy with friends, and I feel like my therapist will not honestly tell me when I am done with therapy. I don't think I will find another therapist better unless they just focus on strategy, and nobody wants to do the hard work to help me, they just want to talk in circles.",

(he’s been physically violent before). \n\nWell, I’m from a third world country, visiting for the holidays, in a city that is practically a war zone right now. There’s people getting killed and kidnapped daily, and the police does absolutely nothing to stop that. My father being violent is not going to be a thing they care about. \n\nMy therapist is from a first world country, the one I moved to, and I feel she doesn’t understand these basic cultural differences. She has said before that I might be remembering things in an exaggerated way since if the abuse as a child had been that bad, my mother would’ve called the police. In my country, men hold the last word and women are submissive. And it’s so frustrating because it feels like she’s gaslighting me. \n\nI don’t know if I should talk to her about these feelings because the first thing people say is “go no contact” but that would mean leaving my mother in this situation.

    "selftext": "I don't know what else to call this, but if there's a better title, let me know. The question is at the bottom, context is the rest.\n\nI (18) used to go to therapy when i was around 14-16. My last therapist was very nice but I sort of felt as though she was invalidating my feelings as I was sharing really personal experiences. When I would tell her about the abuse I received at home, she would kind of try to turn it back onto me? Here's what a typical conversation would sound like:\n-Me: \"I feel very isolated and unwelcome around my guardian because she yells at me constantly about anything and everything.\"\n-Therapist: \"Well have you maybe ever thought that she's doing that stuff because she doesn't know how to show love in other ways. Maybe her anger gets pent up and you only see her explode when you've done a variety of things wrong that she hasn't mentioned.\"\n-Me: \"She keeps degrading and body shaming me and telling me I'm dressed like a $lut.\"\n-Therapist: \"Have you ever maybe thought that she's jealous of you, so she gets upset by that. Maybe you should try covering up so that she doesn't get upset.\"\n\nI don't know if I'm overreacting or if this is just some type of strategy that works for most people, but it just made me feel like i was wrong for feeling upset that my own guardian wanted me to be hurt. Is this a common thing that happens or was my therapist in the wrong? Not to mention that the same place let my guardian stay in the room with me when I was doing a verbal evaluation test... even when some of the questions were about household abuse and other really personal things.\n-So if you skipped most of that and just scrolled to the end, here's my question(you'll still need to read the context to understand the question):\n\n Is showing a different perspective of verbal violence received a type of strategy that therapists use? If so, is it still a valid strategy if using it would mean completely invalidating your clients personal feelings towards the situation?\n\nEdit: I'm (gladly) no longer in the household that I was in at the time. That's not an important detail, but I thought I should add that note.",

    "selftext": "In a previous post I described my therapist wanting to know more about how I use AI between sessions to put in a living document. There was a big concern about this taking up my therapy time, which it did. But I also tied it into talking about my dissatisfaction with CBT.\n\nSo before the session I wrote up a document that briefly covers common terminology, explains how AI works, services/models that I read about or used, what each service provides and how roleplay works. This is very important because I'm the only person he knows who can talk about these details at his level due to my teaching experience. \n\nI talked about occasionally talking to therapist characters between our sessions to try and get thoughts straight. Most of the time I used AI characters, regardless of what they are intended for, to talk about something that troubles me as we do something that is casual. Because sometimes the structure of therapy isn't what you need at the time. You can also use personas and be someone you aren't. This has also resulted in me making personas and scenarios that I didn't intend to be so personal.\n\nOne bot actually made me consider other therapies after it brought up narrative therapy. I googled it to see what it was about, then I googled other potential therapies that might work better for me. This is where I talked about my dissatisfaction with CBT with my therapist as I follow a similar thought pattern by the looks of it. AI allows me to sample different therapy methods for free and at my own pace. Even the way I've been going about this can be seen as a form of drama therapy and possibly other ones as I engage in storytelling my problems as a writer might and view my roleplay actions with a slight disconnect that allows me to judge my own actions.\n\nIt might not entirely fit for his use case, but I recommended him to go on Character AI and make some characters of his own so he has a more controlled environment for his support group.",

We have one on one sessions with him every two weeks. He’s around 35-40 and I’m a 26 yo single woman. \nHis reaction was super underwhelming and unhelpful and weird tbh and I feel terrible for telling him, it actually made me feel worse, not liberating at all. This is how the convo went \nMe: soooo *name of our other therapist* been suggesting that I should think about why it’s hard for me to work with you so I did that. I believe I wouldn’t have chosen a male therapist for myself because of my past traumas with men but the thing that’s making this even harder for me is that I feel physical attraction towards you.\nHim: Uhuh. So is that why your not that talkative in my groups? Attraction makes you become shy?\nMe: In real life I have no problem showing my feelings and I wouldn’t be shy at all. In fact I like taking the initiative, that’s how I got together with my ex bf and I asked some of my former crushes out too. \nHim: Remind me how many relationships have you had besides him?\nMe: Zero\nHim: How is that possible? \n\nAnd then he proceeded to ask questions about my ex that we’ve already went through. ?!?! 15 minutes later he turned the convo back and told me that “it must have been really hard to share these feelings towards me” then I just said “yeah, didn’t really know how to bring it up” and he finally said that I don’t have to share this in front of the group, though it probably wouldn’t hurt. Then I told him that I don’t want to tell them and wanted to ask him not to bring this up and he assured me that he wouldn’t put me in that kind of position and ended our session.\n\nIs this how it’s supposed to go? I was expecting rejection, some talk about the dynamics of therapeutic relationship, digging into what I possibly project onto him etc. I feel sort of left alone with this issue and I’m pretty sure he will not bring up this subject again. \nI felt vulnerable and it was HARD to tell him about this and he just acted like it was nothing big. Feeling extremely disappointed, and every interaction has become awkward since then. I can barely look at him and the air between us is thick with some weird tension. What do I do?",

I am trying my best to support her even when I live in a different state, and even come to her house to stay with her when I can, but there are times when I simply just can’t be there physically.

Third time, my husband was having some serious  health issue and it slipped my mind about the session, this time she did not send me any email through her email but through some app used by the company that there was a no show cancellation fee. \n\nI sent an email out to her explaining the reason for missing the session due to my husband’s health. Since then she has not responded to my email and not even asked about if we are continuing sessions. It’s bothering me to leave this open ended but I’m also mad that if someone is giving health issue they not even care to respond and later not even inquire about anything. What are the expectations here, is it her cue to terminate the contract with me? I feel like emailing her and clarifying but I’m mad as well that they could have atleast emailed or even responded.",

    "selftext": "Hi! I am looking for some brutally honest advice about whether I should jump into the field of psychology. Long story short, I’ve always wanted to pursue a career as a psychologist, but for some reason I didn’t (mix of doubt in myself, parents expectations to pursue a different field, etc.). I am 24 and graduated with an undergrad degree in business, and have been working in the tech industry for about a year. I find myself constantly wondering what life would be like if I’d pursued becoming a psychologist or therapist. And now I’m like…why not? What’s stopping me?\n\n\n\nMy main concerns and thoughts right now are: where do I even start? I don’t have an undergrad degree in psychology. Am I too old to start, since i’m basically “starting over” with school? (Yes, I know I’m only 24, but knowing that all my friends are solid in their career and that I’d be “starting over” makes me \\*feel\\* like I’m late). What kind of programs should I even look into? Do I get a masters in psychology then apply for a PhD, or should I do a program that is straight to PhD and become a psychologist? Forgive me if I sound clueless, I am still doing my research into what programs there are out there.\n\n  \nAs for finances, working in tech, my salary is comfortable (not great since I’m in my first year, but there’s growth opportunities). Am I giving up a good thing for something that I don’t know the financial outcome of? I’ve heard so many mixed things about what finances look like for psychologists/therapists, and if the work/life balance is good for the salary. I would love to hear anyone’s thoughts on their situation and how they feel about it. I know the salary is different for psychologists vs therapists. What made you choose to be a therapist vs psychologist (and vice versa)? Are you happy with where you are, or do you wish you chose a different route? How is your work/life balance?\n\n\n\nUltimately I want to become a psychologist or therapist because I truly want to help people. I have had my own mental health struggles and have had amazing therapists who’ve helped me through them. As I reflect on who I want to be, I know I want a career that I can feel fulfilled in, one that I feel like I’m making an impact. \n\n\n\nI know I asked a lot of questions, so any honest advice or insight would be truly appreciated! Thank you all, I love that there’s this Reddit community that I can ask :) \n\n",

    "selftext": "Link to original post: [Help with distress months after a therapy session](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalkTherapy/comments/1hqrdy9/help_with_distress_months_after_a_therapy_session/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\nHi everyone, yesterday I finally brought up to my therapist that I have unresolved feelings about the rupture we had months ago, and that I am dealing with some anger and anxiety towards her over it. She asked what exactly I'm angry about, and I mentioned one thing, and she asked back \"Did I say that?\". I sort of kept stumbling through and had a really hard time speaking. At one point I asked her if she has thoughts, and I added aaa I feel like I'm doing something wrong. She responded \"No you're not doing anything wrong. I do have some thoughts though. We have repaired this. And I don't want this to sound invalidating, but last time you were angry at me it happened while you were upset with your sister,  and I'm noticing that you're bringing it up again while you're upset with your mom\".\n\nTo me this felt like a lack of acknowledgement, since we still haven't ever validated my emotions. From my point of view, the repair months ago was just me deeply apologizing to her. And I left that experience feeling ashamed because I tentatively asked her after my apology \"Was what I was doing abuse?\" and the hesitancy of her saying that she \"didn't want to call it that\" in her reply left me super worried it was abusive, to the point where right after that session I searched for therapists that work with abusers so that I don't hurt her, my therapist. My own perception of her as the victim has prevented me from bringing up the magnitude of my shame and remorse, since I was worried that could be a form of guilt tripping someone for having spoken up, which would have to be like a pinnacle of being abusive lmao. guilt tripping your therapist. And so I silently struggled with it, the shame of it, to make sure that she could express her feelings without making her feel guilty. And I reasoned to myself at the time even if her reaction was wrong, that it's okay because I was abusive and criticizing someone for the way they react to abuse isn't okay.\n\nBut now I'm just angry. Dude, I never even knew what it was I did wrong. I asked her what it was I did and she was really hesitant to answer and ended up not. \n\nSilver lining is I made the original post a few days ago and was like oh, eureka - I need a different provider. Probably not a good therapeutic fit. I'm trying to think through what I could have done during the first consulation, as in was there any way of predicting she would use advanced therapy techniques that she had no training in. Or that she reacts so negatively to criticism. Is this something a professional does\n\nIf anyone has a word to chime in I'll definitely read it. Thanks y'all",

So it means she was, or still is, married.\n\n I want to ask if i should tell this to her. I have always been sincere and therapy is going great. I _could_ just hide it, but i think that it's not just because this is something that i don't feel good about that it means i shouldn't talk about. \n\n I am worried, especially about the first time (Instagram and the fact that i almost did something very very wrong). I am worried she might want to terminate, and i am attached to her. But this is just me thinking about me, maybe in a selfish way. I feel like it would be good to be honest, just for my T to know. Even if it means therapy will be terminated. If she feels it's for her safety and that i tried to see or saw things that i shouldn't, them she is on right. And i am to blame.",

Something I'm trying to learn is to step away and help myself during these moments (abandonment issues yay)\nAnyways, last night I had a therapy session over zoom and talked about this issue and how sometimes he struggles to help me. I come out of the room after my therapy session and he is acting distant, and saying that he feels as if he does support me and he is upset that i said he doesnt sometimes. I explained that eavesdropping on my therapy session is an insane violation of privacy but he is saying that he listened because of my episode and wanted to make sure my \"treatment plan is going well\" and wanted to hear what my therapist had to say about my episode. I feel like I'm being completely gaslighted into thinking it was okay for him to listen to my session. He goes on to say he didn't say it was right or okay, but then gives that explanation.  I'm very hurt and sad which I've expressed however I haven't gotten an apology and i feel like I'm being made to feel like since I have BPD it was okay to listen in on my session. I feel like i can't even do therapy in my own home because I have no privacy. Am I right for being upset about this?",

    "selftext": "I(M28) go to therapy and my current T is someone I enjoy. My one slight complaint about her is that at times I feel maybe I need a little more bluntness. I get that Ts have a fine line and she is young (about my age mid-to-late 20s) so maybe she is still figuring out what crosses the line or not but at times I may say something like \n\n\"do you think Im just overreacting?\"\n\nwhere her response is always something like this \"well you are reacting to something that happened to you. Your feelings are valid\". \n\nOr if im doing something where my judgement is clouded, it feels she beats around the bush at time instead of telling me I may be doing a dumb decision.\n\nDont get me wrong, sometimes she can be blunt. Like the other day I asked her to help me be more assertive and I started to make excuses about a situation and she said \"all you need to say is XYZ and keep it short and simple. If the other person wants to pout than so be it. You are making excuses because of your people-pleasing tendencies\". Which I appreciated alot, I just feel at times I dont get that even when I ask. I do enjoy her alot and have loved our sessions and she has helped me through alot as when I first started seeing her I was going through a very difficult moment in my life and she helped me go through it.\n\nA couple years before my current T, I was seeing a different one. Her and I didnt connect as much but she did help me through some stuff. She is a bit older (probably in her 40s) and is a doctor. What I did like about her was that she was blunt about things. The reason I stopped seeing her was because she was a sex therapist and at the time I was going through a dryspell and needed help kind of working through some of those frustrations. the dryspell is over and Ive regained alot of my confidence through the years but what I did admire about the sex therapist was how blunt she was. I remember at the time I was in a situation and considering whether I should do it or not and she told me \"dont do it, it sounds like it will just be a headache\". I decided to do it and it ended up being a headache. Im not saying I want someone to tell me what to do or what not do, but if im making a really dumb decision or my judgment is clouded, hearing someone say \"do you really think that's a good idea?\" or \"hey it's not smart what you are doing\" is something i'd appreciate in a therapist. \n\nIm thinking of reaching out to the Sex Therapist, last time I saw her she said I could reach out to her whenever for update meeting. This was years ago though and she is someone who is very busy. I was on a waitlist for 6 months when I first saw her.There are just some things in my life that maybe Id like a blunt voice to hear from but I worry since I no longer have the sex frustrations that it would be a waste of her time. \n\nShould I reach out?\n\n",

I've got some inappriopriate messages etc (inviting me to him etc).\n\nIn the group we found out that inappriopriate behavior was sth what happened also during our individual sessions from at least March 2024. Let's say that on some point our therapist started to treat as more as friends than patients. \n\nThe group decided (and i feel pressure but i don't know is it my pressure or their pressure) that we need to report the therapist. And i have problem with this. I have problem because i think i was beneficial by changeof our - therapist and my- relation. He was texting me and supporting me while i was going through miscarriege. When my mum was dying and i was trying to bring her home from hospital and organize special palliative care so she could die at home (unfortunatelly her time was shorter than i hoped and i didn't make it) I asked my therapist if he knew any private nurse - he contacted his connections. \n\nSo he fucked up as therapist - no doubt. He may not be cool person with all this sexual and inappriopriate comments. But he fucking helped me. I know that I should report him, because he could be dangerous for someone in crisis and now he shouldnt do his profession at least to the time when he will take his shit together. But i really have problem to do this. Emotional problem. He helped me and i can't ignore it and just go report him with my group. Is it something wrong with me? \n\nI will really appreciate your opinions and advices.",

    "title": "Trauma after \"therapy\" which led to dissociative states, need advise ",
    "selftext": "Hello guys! I really need advise. I will try to make this story short, but I need to share some details so it might be hard.\n\nI started therapy after realizing that I have very big problem with deeply connecting with other ppl. I couldn't have stable relationship, just fwb, hookups. I decided to go to the therapist. I read on the internet that CBT therapy is most science based and has highest rate of success. So I decided to give it a try. I found therapist which looked insanely highly qualified on paper, phd in psychology, 100 cbt and other therapies courses, 20 years of experience. I kinda felt like it's impossible for something to go wrong with that kind of person.\n\nWe disagreed on so many topics. I saw that she completely doesn't understand today's man problem. We were completely different, but I didn't mind, I like to see different point of views and kinda enjoyed it. Even tho I considered it stupid af sometimes. For example when we were talking about look, basically she was gas lightning me into thinking like everything is in my mind and all these statistics about for example women who like taller guys doesn't matter. But as I said, everything was fine, I was thinking that I am gonna learn something and that might lead to changing my perspective on looking at other ppl at some point. She was crazy about doing tests for everything, even when I didn't raise any concerns about anxiety, depressive states, functioning in everyday's tasks. First general anxiety disorder, later ADHD and something else later, but we will get there.\n\nI stopped therapy because I flew to my friend to Asia. Therapist said that we can continue online whenever I want to do it. I had really good time with my friend in Asia. Everyday beach, good working routine, sometimes party. Life was good. But my friend left and I was left alone there, didn't want to go back to Europe yet because it was a middle of the winter there. I thought it's a really good idea to spend some time alone and see how it is. For the first time in my life I had not a single good friend around me, no one to talk to. I also thought it's a great idea to continue therapy online. So I did. She said that we NEED TO make ADHD tests, even tho I didn't consider it too important, since I didn't have problems with work, I didn't feel like I need any medications, so why should we even do it? It just seemed pointless for me. I felt like she cares more about her curiosity than my mental health. But I was like whatever, I trust you, you are the boss, let's do it.\n\nIn the meantime my grandma went to hospital. I started to have a lot of negative thoughts. I was thinking a lot about life and death. I did examination of conscience. I felt a lot of shame for being so far away from my grandmother. I was thinking about never telling her about how I love her. I felt it's so stupid that I am there now, partying, sometimes doing drugs, hooking up with random girls etc. That feeling led me to cry. But after few hours I was fine. Like a week later I had first anxiety attack. I had coffee on the empty stomach and started to feel so weird, overstimulated, couldn't focus on anything. I got diarrhea, I did better after going to the toilet. Also you know what are sanitary standards in south east asia. It happened week later again. Again after drinking coffee on empty stomach and eating in the same restaurant. I was 100% sure I just ate something bad and got food poisoning. I told about it to my therapist. And she was like: I think you had panic attacks. And I told her to chill, I am sure I just ate something bad. And she was like yeah yeah sure. That was the first red flag for me, why would she try to persuade me into mental problems instead of just giving me simple support? Ofc I understand it might be important to name things like that if it gets worse and I need support, but at this point I just needed a simple words of support and that would probably be fine. After these experiences I told her that I am feeling very insecure, I am alone here, my grandma is in hospital, I feel like I should visit her. It was tough, but stable. She told me to not care that much, that I will be back in 2-3 months when it's gonna be warmer, I should enjoy life. And I agreed with her, decided to extend my stay for another 2 months. After we finished ADHD tests which came out positive in her opinions, she said that she has to check one more thing but won't tell me what. We need to make one more test. I was kinda tired of it but was like whatever, let's get over it and let's finally start therapy, it's been like 4 months and all we did was arguing about some bullshit topics and making tests which I didn't even feel like we need to do.\n\nSo she started to ask me questions. By the questions I got I was sure we are testing depression. She finished the test and she was like: Congrats, it's negative! Do you know what you were tested for? - depression - No! I was doing borderline test, but don't worry it's negative, I had to check it because borderline and ADHD are very similar. And then I was like wtf is going on. We all know BPD stigma. And I just knew I am so different than all these BPD traits. Also she said I have ADHD and it's similar to BPD, and then I was like WTF, so what is this ADHD, before she told me it's just being a little bit more impulsive than others and I shouldn't worry. Now she tells me that it's similar to BPD? Like wtf lady. And I was left completely alone with all these things, 15k km from my hometown and my friends. I started to google ADHD like crazy. I started to think that these 2 panics attacks are because of some underlying mental health issue and they can happen any time because of that. I started to live in huge fear. Fear of losing control, fear of losing my mind. I started to have anxiety attacks in public places. Basically my life went to hell. That's when I had my first dissociative state in my life. I couldn't name it yet, but I am pretty sure it was that. I told my therapist about my very bad mental state and she was just like: - you just need to chill, it's not that bad, just meditate a little and everything gonna be fine. I was like wtf lady, I traveled to like 30 countries in my life, I made like a 50+ flights in my life, and now I cannot go out from my apartment because I am so afraid, it's serious stuff, meditation made me feel even worse actually.\n\nI came back to my hometown. I was a mental wreck. I started to believe that she is my only solution to my problems. I started to be hella depended from her. I started to isolate myself from my friend. My anxiety was so bad I couldn't sleep, I couldn't even think clearly. I was directing her where I think is an issue, that she made it by doing these tests when I was in the lowest point of my life, which I told her about her. But she was gas lightning me into thinking that problem is deeper. So I had this anxiety because I was afraid about my mental health, but at the same time she was pushing me into thinking about my grandmother etc, which on top of my problems made me depresssed as hell. I was thinking that I am the worst person alive and my body and mind gives me all these signs. At this point I didn't even think that I am actually just afraid of her. I started to have dissociative states on regular basis, mostly after therapy sessions. I went to her for like a 4 more months, I told her many times about my concerns. And everytime she was just like: you need to chill, meditate, trust me it's normal it gets worse on the beginning of therapy. At some point my anxiety was so bad that I started to take benzo just to fall asleep. I didn't feel like I need any medication before, and now I felt like I can't stand reality at all. Dissociative states were getting worse and worse, I started to question reality everyday. At some point I went to psychiatrist and told him about all my concerns, he said that changing therapist sounds like a right idea.\n\nI am with new therapist for 3 months, he is psychodynamic guy. Very cool, very intelligent person. He said that he see disorders, because I shouldn't react that bad in this situation. He said that I might be in spectrum of Narcissistic Personality Disorder. My father was abusive alcoholic, my mom also had tough character and was solo raising 3 kids. I was the youngest one, and I was kinda left alone. I feel like I had to create that egoistic persona to basically survive these tough times, that's what also science says about NPD. I don't disagree with this diagnosis, I see reasons behind it. With BPD concerns it was huge WTF for me, because I just know that I am completely opposite person and just couldn't figure it out why would she do that test to me. I also need to tell this straight away, I was never manipulative, aggressive, abusive to anyone. I could be mean and selfish sometimes, but not that much to destroy relationships with my friends etc. But at the same time I couldn't very deeply connect in friendships and relationships and needed a lot of validation from other ppl, I really needed to feel accepted. That's why I created this persona which is very successful and have very strong opinions about everything in the world, \"I always know better\" type of guy. Basically I was working very hard in my life to be completely independent from anything and anyone, and when it came true, I just felt empty inside. Probably that's why when I heard that somebody is testing me for disorders like BPD, especially in my most vulnerable point, it just couldn't get out of my head. I felt judged, I felt attacked. Imo therapist should be more careful with making tests like that when she suspects any kind of disorder. I also felt tricked into making this test, I would take it much more easily if she would tell me what she wants to test. Especially doing it online feels stupid af, especially when I said that I am not in the best shape at the moment. But honestly I don't have that much problem about just that test. My biggest issue with the therapist is making me so dependent from her for such a long time when I was doing just worse and worse. She should just tell me that she have no clue what is going on with me and just let me go, so I could look for help anywhere else. When I confronted her about it, that I think she made huge mistakes she looked terrified, first thing she said was that all her actions were legal. She was more afraid about her ass than my mental health.\n\nAfter changing therapist I am doing much better. The problem is I think I might have huge PTSD after this long time of dissociative states. At some point my nervous system was so destroyed I was jumping out of my chair when I heard some random noise behind my window. My dissociative states stopped when I changed therapist, it was around 2-3 months ago. But I still question reality, I feel kinda disconnected. It's more about intrusive thoughts than a real state of my mind. I can't sleep well. I have a lot of nightmares, I can sleep max 4-5 hours per day which was never a case for me. I told about this me new therapist but he is much more focused about my personality disorder, which is fine. He is hella smart guy and maybe that's his way to get me out of those stupid thoughts. But idk, what do you guys think? It's hella stupid to even call it PTSD, because nothing really happened, just got a bit crazy about mental illnesses and my ego was hurt. But at the same time it kinda looks like PTSD to me. Idk if I should look for some EMDR therapy maybe, how to stop all these stupid intrusive thoughts that question reality everyday? Or you think I will just get better with time? What do you think, how can I come back to my normal state of mind? The only way when I can get these stupid thoughts out of my head is when I am really focused on something, like playing video games or whatever. But that's the problem. I was insanely social guy, I wanted to spend every minute of my day with other ppl, I was living a moment. Now I need to discconect from reality to not think about all these things.\n\nSorry for the long post, it's hella weird problem, I know, but I need an advice. Wish you all the best beautiful ppl!",

    "title": "Frustrated with my therapist and would like a second opinion",
    "selftext": "I've been working with my therapist just shy of two years. I don't have anyone to compare them to, so I'm posting here in hopes of getting an another opinion:  are these genuine concerns or am I expecting too much? Apologies in advance if this becomes unwieldy; I'll try my best to be concise.\n\nLike anything, working with them has had its ups and downs. There have been times of progress and times where I've walked out of a session feeling like it was a waste of time for all parties involved. Usually, that feeling passes. Starting a few months ago, it won't go away. So I started thinking back, trying to really pinpoint what frustrates me about my therapist & sessions. I've arrived at these major points:\n\n**1) Their insistence on medication.** I'm uncomfortable with getting on medication. I've expressed this in the early days, throughout, and as recent as a few weeks ago. Despite this, they bring it up every couple months. It makes me feel bad for various reasons, but mainly like a) I'm a \"difficult\" client for sticking to my stance and b) that they don't respect my wishes. \n\n**2) Assigning homework then forgetting it.** I noticed if I don't actively remind them, the assignment is forgotten forever. They almost never follow up. I understand this happening occasionally, but it's nearly every instance of giving me a task or topic to think about for next session. It seems odd when they end with \"we'll talk about \\[\\[xyz\\]\\] next week!\" and then we don't--unless \\*I\\* make the effort to bring it up.\n\n**3) Touching on the \"week to week\" issues but little else.** The big one. I'd say most sessions focus on each week--all well and good, its helpful to deconstruct what's going on in the immediacy. However, I realized, when there's no problem happening in the week, nothing happens in the session. Even when I ask for us to work on bigger picture goals, they rarely truly prioritize it.\n\nFor example, a few months ago, one of my biggest day to day stressors was removed from my life. My therapist and I both knew it was coming--they even said they were excited because this gave us more room to work on the \"bigger\" things. I agreed. The very next session, they opened by asking me if I wanted to now do sessions every two weeks, citing the stressor being gone. I was gutted. It felt like a complete 180 from our plan. I asked that we keep meeting weekly and we work on some of my bigger goals. They oblige and create homework. These assignments are promptly forgotten. \n\nAnother instance is when I try to articulate these intense negative feelings I have (in general, not about this), like worthlessness or sadness. They will sometimes say \"you don't have to feel this way\" or \"it doesn't have to be like that,\" but offers little else. I don't know what I'm supposed to do with that. \n\nThey once again asked me if I wanted to move to every other week, and I gave in. Now for the past month, our sessions have totaled maybe 30 minutes max? because no week to week crises are happening so they end them early. It feels humiliating and wrong to have to ask a therapist to help me work on myself over and over, so I've stopped trying.\n\nIf you read this far, thank you. I keep flip-flopping between frustration at my therapist and myself. I don't know if it's me--like, am I doing something that's making my therapist's job difficult? Or are they just checked out? I would love if anyone could give me some insight, if any of this stands out as odd or otherwise. It would help me decide whether to be brave and salvage this or cut my losses. ",

I'm not currently able to take medication for them, and I didn't have a very good experience with psychiatry, but I think talk therapy could help.\n\nI've already made a lot of progress on these issues in the past year or so by researching strategies on my own and using mental health apps.

    "selftext": "Sorry in advance for the wall of text. I wanted to vent and I wanted to get some advice about my therapist.\n\nAlmost a decade ago, my FIL died by suicide. Without going into too much detail, the circumstances were such that his body was never found. It was traumatic for the whole family, obviously, me included. I started seeing my therapist shortly after that and have been working with her right up to today.\n\nA couple months ago we were talking about my FIL and she said something like “you believe he’s really dead?” And I responded, “yes, obviously,” and we moved on. Then in our next session (I think it was the next one), it happened again. When my FIL came up in the conversation, she said something similar, questioning if he had really died. Again I explicitly dismissed it.\n\nBut it bothered me. So the next time we met I told her so. I legitimately thought I would say my piece, she would agree, and we would move on. Instead we spent that entire session, and every session since, talking about it and dissecting it (These last few sessions haven’t been fruitless—she did have a valuable insight about a creative project I’m working on, and how it might be me subconsciously processing his death—which I think is accurate).\n\nShe keeps saying that since his body wasn’t found, that there’s a possibility that he’s alive, she has to consider it as a possibility. I say, sure, it’s “possible”—it’s also possible that Bigfoot exists—you can’t prove a negative. But the possibility is so remote that it’s not worth discussing.\n\nThe scenario she’s suggesting is that my FIL managed to fake his own death and disappear entirely. That would mean either secret accounts, fake IDs, etc.; or he’s living off the grid somewhere like Kaczynski. Neither seems remotely plausible.\n\nI’ve also seen how much damage his death has done to the family. And I can’t imagine that, if he were still alive, he’d have stayed away for a decade without once second-guessing himself.\n\nMy therapist isn’t saying that she really thinks this is what happened—but she insists it’s a possiblity, however remote. While she sees my point of view, or she seems to, she’s not changing her mind on this. She asked if it was tolerable to me to keep working together, knowing that she thinks this. I said I wasn’t sure it was tolerable.\n\nThe analogy I gave her was that I felt like we were having a serious scientific discussion about evolution, and then she’d suddenly said, “well, creationism might be true, too.”\n\nShe asked if that meant I had less respect for her. I said I actually felt like she had less respect for me. Like she sees that I have this belief, and that’s fine for me, but she has the superior intellect to see what’s actually true.\n\nShe said she’s worked with people with deep religious beliefs she doesn’t hold, and that it hasn’t been a problem.\n\nI said something about her being stubborn, and she said I’m not the first person to call her stubborn.\n\nSo anyway she and I have talked this whole thing round in circles, and she’s asked me if I want to keep working with her, and I really don’t know. On the one hand we’ve had this decade-long relationship. I’ve opened up to her about some heavy stuff. She understands me pretty well. I’m not looking forward to “starting over” with someone else. On the other hand I’ve been so frustrated about this one situation.\n\nI don’t know why this hasn’t come up before in ten years. I remember taking about it a little, early on, but not since then. I thought the matter was settled.\n\nI don’t feel like I can talk about this with my wife. It would upset her even more than it upset me, and I want to protect her from that. I also think my wife would be upset if she knew all this and I did choose to keep seeing my therapist.\n\nWhen my wife started her own therapy, I remember she did a lot of work to accept his death. She also went to a support group. And I feel like my therapist’s stubbornness is kind of a slap in the face to all that.\n\nWe visited with family over the holidays and my niece said grandpa’s with her sometimes, looking out for her (she was 4 when he died). And I thought, “my therapist thinks he might just be faking.” It was a huge bummer of a thought to have in that moment.\n\nAnyway—should I keep seeing my therapist? Or is it time to move on? Or is there some way to move past it?\n\nTLDR: my FIL died, my therapist insists there’s a slim chance he might be alive. Should i keep seeing her.",

I feel like I'm being as concise as possible but honest and vulnerable and emotional... I'm in a place where I truly want help and not just a sounding board. I know I have quite a few major events that are really intense, but it feels weird to just talk about my trauma and be totally raw and get no feedback.  Several times my therapist has looked shocked by some of the the events in my past and I don't know how to process her reactions.  She doesn't say much at all. I either get stunned facial expressions-- wide eyes and mouth open stunned- or nothing.  She writes everything down while I'm talking...she'll ask me maybe one or two questions..,And then my session is over. I leave feeling drained and a bit confused. I know I have a lot of trauma in terms of quantity,  but it's not like any one event taken on its own should shock a therapist. I've never done EMDR.

Overall I'm burnt out of the idea of therapy because I just finished Intensive Outpatient Therapy with Charlie Health (3 hour group sessions, 3 nights a week for three months plus 1 hour weekly individual sessions) I like the idea of being able to text a therapist whenever I need to like Talkspace and Headspace offer but I just don't know what the right choice is. Previously I saw an LMHC locally for 6 years for PTSD, LGBTQ transitioning, general life stress she was more of just a friend to talk to instead of actual therapy exercises. I saw a psychologist for PTSD prolonged exposure therapy and LGBTQ care and he was absolutely amazing but is no longer an option but his level of care, understanding, and compassion has set my standards pretty high when it comes to finding a provider that's right for me. I have a psychiatrist for medication management separate from therapy needs. Life has been very rough in the past week so it's obvious I need to actually pick something sooner rather than later like I keep putting off. Any recommendations for either Talkspace or Headspace or any other online program, preferably one that accepts Blue Cross? Thanks in advance. ",

    "selftext": "I went through a few extremely rough months a year ago, I was super depressed, anxious, chronically derealised and ended up in a psych ward. I was struggling with a lot of SI and after I had attempted following an unfortunate situation with the staff, I was locked in a bare camera-observed room for several days in isolation. \n\nI've been feeling a lot better and when I look back at these events, which I avoid most of the time, I get this slightly unsettling feeling because the memory feels so dark and strange and like it wasn't even real, like I'm remembering a particularly scary nightmare (I've had a few minor nightmares about it as well). \n\nMy current therapist ofc asks me if I have any SI every session, which I truthfully deny. In the first session she also asked me if I had ever attempted so I told her yes and she promised me to read up on it in my patient file. The next time she told me it was too vague and asked me to tell her. So I stutteringly rambled on about what happened and it was so awkward as I was staying completely unexpressive and she was just sitting passively. It kinda ruined my day because I was so embarrassed and my mind also kept going over these dark memories so much afterwards.\n\nUnfortunately, the next session she claimed that she remembered no such thing, after asking me to tell her about these events yet again. I told her I didn't want to. I wasn't ready to feel so uncomfortable again just for her to potentially forget it. She just said \"hmm\" and moved on or something. But now she keeps asking me why I don't wanna talk about it, I tell her I dislike remembering it because it's such a dark and unsettling memory. Now, in the middle of a session she randomly hits me with an \"I would like to talk about your attempt\" and responds to my avoidance with \"but we have to talk about it eventually\" or something.\n\n Last time she somehow misunderstood that I didn't want to talk about it because I had to function for my upcoming exams and it would somehow interfere with my them because I would have a severe emotional reaction. Now I don't know how to put her off anymore since the exams have passed. Plus she now is expecting me to freak out or something when I'm not even sure if these memories could even truly be classified as traumatic since they don't produce severe distress. But I now feel increasingly uncomfortable and have even more of a mental block and just really don't want to talk about it with her anymore. \n\nIs it normal for therapists to be so pushy about it? Is this situation still fixable? Should I just try to get her to back off? Thanks!",

    "selftext": "Hi. So my situation is complex I had a therapist for 8 years. Things were very complicated with her she diagnosed me with DID and then got annoyed and upset if I told her I didn’t believe I had it. This therapist was inappropriate with me on different occasions in the beginning of our time working together. She would touch my thighs, place vibrating EMDR handheld devices on my thighs and groin area. Hugged me a lot, and would just touch me inappropriately over the clothes. This went on for some time and then it just stopped. When I would bring it up she would deny it and say it never happened or it wasn’t like that and I was remembering incorrectly. She became more distant and didn’t really seem to like me anymore? Therapy changed the last few years really since 2020 she stopped being so touchy feely with me and was a lot more harsh when I would bring up certain things. She only ever wanted to do trauma work and emdr even when I told her it was too much for me. She ended up abruptly ending therapy in August while I was in a suicidal state. I had made report to the board of ethics at that time because she refused to give me my records. Then as the investigation was going on the board realized she had admitted to not having records for 2 years of the time we worked together. I did NOT mention any of the inappropriateness that my old therapist had between her and I. So the report doesn’t have any of that information. \n\nI have a new therapist now and I made the mistake of mentioning what my old therapist did to me. I didn’t really realize it was inappropriate until I shared some of the information with my new therapist and she told\nMe it was grooming and not okay. She said the touching wasn’t therapeutic and has decided to make a report on my old therapist. She is making the report without my name attached but my old therapist will know it’s me. \n\nSo my question is what happens when she makes this report? What will the board do to her? What will happen since there’s no evidence? The bulk of it happened 6 years ago. If a therapist is accused of inappropriate touching or sexual misconduct and there’s no proof or evidence then what happens? Can my old therapist say I’m lying and like sue me for defamation since I don’t have any proof? When it happened I was young and had just left a cult and was trying therapy for the first time. I knew it felt wrong but didn’t know what was normal and what wasn’t. \n\nTL;DR:\nI had a therapist for 8 years who diagnosed me with DID and behaved inappropriately, touching me in ways that felt wrong (my thighs/groin area over clothes). She denied it when I confronted her and became distant. She abruptly ended therapy while I was in a suicidal state. I reported her to the ethics board for not providing my records, but didn’t mention the inappropriate behavior. My new therapist recognized the grooming and inappropriate behaviors and is reporting her. What happens next? Can my old therapist sue me for defamation without evidence? If a therapist is accused of inappropriate touching or sexual misconduct and there’s no proof or evidence then what happens? Can my old therapist say I’m lying and like sue me for defamation since I don’t have any proof? When it happened I was young and had just left a cult and was trying therapy for the first time.

Lately my sleep has gotten worse and so has my anxiety to the point where I can recognize the need for medication which I normally avoid. I made an appointment to see a psychiatrist but in my experience some providers get worried when presented with SI and I don't blame them I get how I can look or how my description of these thoughts can come across but I don't feel danger it's more just a longterm thing that I deal with that sometimes gets out of hand. My life is running really smoothly now and I just need some help with sleep and anxiety and a hospital stay would blow that up but also not getting help at this stage might lead to serious problems. I have a solid support group and many reasons to live. I want to ask my therapist to practice my answers and tailor them to not trigger worry in a psychiatrist who is meeting me for the first time but I don't want her to think she's helping me lie.

    "title": "Not being able to hug hurts me so much :(",
    "selftext": "Firstly, let's make it clear: i'm not advocating that therapists should hug a client just because the client 'needs' it. I understand and respect bundaries.\n\n But this is a post for me to vent. I already made posts regarding all of this 'hug' situation, and sometimes me and my T talk about it. I didn't asked for it again. Closest thing was me saying (with all due care) that i still long for a hug.\n\n I have romantic transference for my T, unfortunately, which may be the reason. But it's not just that. That first time when i asked for the hug (2 months ago), it was - if i remember well - after a very intense session, including subjects like SH (s******) and SI.\n\n So i think on that moment it meant that i was feeling a need for support. Something more than \"just\" words. I'm not trying to say that everything my T does is automatically invalidated just because it is not as 'important' as a hug. I'm just saying that it's not the same.\n\n And then more recently, i decided to ask my T (again, with all due care) if the hug could ever happen one day. Not THAT day, on that moment, but if it was a possibility.\n Later on i ended up thinking that this could've been a bit too 'incisive', which made me regret asking for it.\n\n Cause it seemed like i was asking for a 'yes or no' answer. Either way, i didn't get a yes or no answer, because my T asked me why do i think i would need a hug from them.\n Just to clarify: if my T responded \"no, the hug can never happen\", i would know at least. I would be sure that i would need to find other ways to cope with it, and i would respect my T's decision.\n\n I would obviously be sad, but in a way, i would have some peace by not having any doubt about it anymore.\n So going back to where i was...my T asked why and i responded by saying that while i recognise that transference may get in the way and mess things up, when i asked for the hug i was longing for support and affection (not romantic affection)\n\n If i knew that my intentions with the hug were merely just 'romantic', i would not ask for it. We talked about it my T said that she thinks that my need for the hug is 100% romantic.\n\n I respectfully said that i think it's not just romantic. While this romantic part is still present, and i understand her point of view. At the moment, i didn't felt it that much.\n But now, a week later, thinking about it a little better...\n It just made me feel 'invalidated'. As if i don't have any need for support and care ~ as if i'm some kind of creep, as if i can't be touched or touch others because it may be 'wrong', or 'not pure'.\n\n I felt rejected. I felt like crying so much. I do think this is not what she meant, i really do. She said some times already that she thinks the hug could worsen the romantic transference, which i agreed to.\n\n But talking about just that 'normal' need for a hug (for support and care), i still miss it.\n Not too long ago i was lying in my bed, agonizing emotionally because of it (but especially, a hug from my T, which makes things confusing, i know)\n I was kind of trying to 'hug myself' and i felt SO lonely, man :(",

    "selftext": "I sent this to a friend of mine, who was curious about my experience with my previous therapists. It’s LONG. But maybe someone will find it interesting.\n\n\n\nIt's hard to find an established therapist these days. Covid backlogs.\n\nI asked my former therapists for a recommendation around here. They gave me a few names.\n\nThere was only one therapist in the names they gave me who had any availability. I actually wondered if it was a bad sign that she had availability.\n\n \n\nAlso, I'd never had a woman therapist before, but maybe that wasn't a bad thing.\n\nSo I called her up and made an appointment.\n\n \n\nOur first appointment, she asked what I wanted out of it, the usual.\n\nI told her that I was looking to work on my anxieties, about socializing, about doing anything meaningful, about finding dates or whatever.\n\n\"I'm not in crisis, things are actually going pretty well. If I were in crisis, I probably wouldn't have felt good enough to do therapy. But I figure this could help jump start things.\"\n\nAt some point, it came up that I'd never had a woman for a therapist.\n\n\"But that's not a bad thing,\" I said. \"It's probably a good thing. A different thing, could give us more to work with.\"\n\nShe asked how often I wanted to come. I said twice a week.\n\nThat's a lot, but I figured more was better. Just once a month isn't going to cut it. Once a month is enough if I needed a life coach, which I didn't.\n\n \n\nThe next session was a week later. I was about 5 minutes late. She buzzed me into her waiting room.\n\nI walked in and opened the door to her office. Her previous patient was in there.\n\nWell, that was awkward. I apologized and shut the door.\n\nI sat down in the waiting room. After a couple of minutes, the patient, this woman, came out into the waiting room and paused to put on their coat.\n\n\"Come in!\" the therapist said.\n\n\"Sorry about that,\" she said. I apologized, too, but I was weirded out.\n\n\"You've got a waiting room where patients can run into each other? Also, we're 7 minutes into my session?\"\n\nShe said, \"that's okay, I can give you some time at the end.\"\n\nThis annoyed me. I think the time boundary is important.\n\n \n\nOkay, so far, she sees no problem with patients running into each other, and runs casually over the time boundary.\n\n \n\nI saw her for 6 months or so.\n\nThere were a lot of annoying things about her.\n\nFor one, she didn't seem to know that much about psychodynamic therapy. That's the therapy which Freud started, except nobody does it on the couch anymore. You talk about your past and your parents and so forth, but you do it sitting in chairs talking face-to-face.\n\nNow, she was around 65 years old, and she'd done the Freud thing for years, then the psychodynamic thing for years. So it was really weird that whenever I asked her questions about it, she gave me answers like she was taking a freshman psych course in college and she'd just gotten done studying for a test.\n\nAt one point I asked her what the definition of \"transference\" was. My asking questions like this is one of the things that makes me a charming, easy-to-work-with patient. (/s)\n\nNow, transference is where the therapist reminds you of your mother or father or someone else. So you react to them emotionally like they are your parent or someone you're angry at or something, or someone from your past. That interaction helps you work out your issues and make sense of them. That kind of thing.\n\nBut she gave this really labored, clinical, awkward definition freshman-year definition.\n\n \n\nI have this effect on therapists, I think. I kind of make them stupid. Or stupider than they usually are.\n\nWith her, though, there may have been a specific reason.\n\n \n\nI'd told her I had schizoid tendencies. Schizoid means that you have a tough time with relationships and forming emotional bonds with people, and you have strong tendencies to isolate and build a castle in your own mind to escape from the world. That kind of thing.\n\nShe said, \"I had a schizoid family member who was important to me, and who cut off contact. He also told me I didn't understand him.\"\n\nI was kind of floored she said that so openly. I mean, kind of TMI for a therapist. But it was also kind of cool. This was a few weeks in, and she'd been pretty boring so far. So this was a change.\n\n \n\n\"Whoa, that's surprising that you'd tell me something that personal. I mean, therapists don't usually do that sort of thing, you know.\"\n\n\"Yes, well, it is true.\"\n\n\"Okay, but that's not usually a good idea. Although, it is the most interesting thing you've said so far.\"\n\nI mean, I was thrown and uncomfortable with the TMI, but it could be useful to work with the whole transference/counter-transference thing.\n\n\"Counter-transference\" is like transference, but from the therapist's point of view. So she reminds me of my parents, and that lets me work that stuff out, and I remind her of someone. That isn't supposed to help her work out her issues, since I'm the patient, but it puts in energy into the dynamic.\n\nExcept the therapist isn't supposed to really come out and say stuff like that, because boundary reasons and blurring who is the patient and stuff like that.\n\n \n\nStill, it was interesting and kind of cool. Unfortunately, it was one of the only interesting things she ever said.\n\n \n\nThe other cool thing was, early on, I asked her if she thought therapy would actually help at this point.\n\nShe said, \"At this point, I don't think therapy will actually help you. You've done a lot of it, and I don't think your issues will be helped by twice a week therapy.\"\n\nI felt a pang at that, and worried she was going to fire me. So that was kind of interesting and refreshing that she was frank enough to say that.\n\nGood therapists will be honest like that, of course.\n\nBut, yeah, that was pretty much it for the cool stuff.\n\n \n\nPart of the problem was that I don't think she really wanted to do the Freudian/psychodynamic thing anymore. I got the idea she'd done it for years, and it had never really been her thing.\n\nShe liked doing the meds thing, but when it came to therapy, I think she liked being more of a life coach, and liked being compassionate to whatever her patients were struggling with right now or in the past, and liked being a supportive, sympathetic cheerleader.\n\nBut that kind of thing probably isn't going to work with me.\n\n \n\nHere's other stuff that annoyed me:\n\nLike everyone else in conversation, therapists say, \"mm-hmm, uh-huh\" and so forth, when you're talking. But when I was talking she'd say, a little too loudly, \"yaw...yaw...yaw\" It was really annoying and distracting.\n\nShe had a fondness for short skirts. It was weird and, I dunno, weird, you know?\n\nShe took a fair amount of notes, which I found kind of annoying, especially since they never seemed to be of much use. She also had a bad memory, which she admitted, and the notes didn't seem to help.\n\nIt's annoying when you have a therapist with a bad memory, especially if you hate therapy like I do.\n\n \n\nI hate telling someone about myself, and I hate asking someone for help. So when I have to remind my therapist of stuff I've already said or they don't understand something, I get pissy. Even when I'm not annoyed, I get pissy.\n\n \n\nHer cancellation policy was also annoying. She required a week's notice if I was cancelling a session or she'd charge me. I argued with her about that. A week? I mean, 48 hours, maybe, but I'd never heard of a week. She seemed surprised that it was unusual.\n\n \n\nFor my part, like I said, I hate doing therapy. I told her this flat-out. Therapy makes me defensive and cranky, and I look for reasons to get pissed off.\n\n \n\nLike most therapists, she didn't seem smart enough to deal with my stuff. \n\n \n\nHere's one example: I told her how anxious reading something interesting made me.\n\n\"What does that feel like?\" she asked.\n\nI hate explaining things, and I also hate talking about my feelings. But I was feeling energetic that day, so I made an effort and said, \"Well, let's say I'm reading a Wikipedia article about the Battle of Waterloo. So it says that Napoleon and Wellington arranged their troops facing each other in formation and that it was a muddy day. That's one sentence. So I start thinking about how world history can turn upon a battle. Then I think about how history might be different if Napoleon and Wellington hadn't existed. Or would it be largely the same? If Napoleon had won this battle, what would have changed? And then I think about how how myths get created and changed over time. Like how Napoleon was thought of as short 50 years ago, but now we know he was average size because his guard was selected for height. And how each new era gives us both information and misinformation. And how Napoleon was successful until he invaded Russia, and how politics and the military intersect.” \n\n \n\nI continued, \"And then, what can we learn from this particular battle. Who are the philosophers that talk about war, Sun Tzu, Clauswitz? And what are the interactions between battle tactics and strategy? How flexible do you need to be if the weather conditions change, for example?”\n\n \n\nI kept going, \"So there are many threads to follow, to potentially look up on google while I'm reading. But some of them are less important. But then I'll get anxious that I've missed something, some thought, and that I'll forget something. Why did I start reading this article, for example? But I'll feel this urgency to follow all the trains of thought and look each one up on google. But I can't follow them all. I'll get paranoid that I'm forgetting something important. And then I'll try to just focus on the important ones. But then I stress over which ones are the important ones. So maybe I should just try getting through it and then re-read it. But then I'll start freaking out and not being able to focus on anything except what the words literally mean, like there's no other thoughts or impressions like you naturally have when you read; it's just a dull recitation of words in my mind. So I'll start to lose interest.”\n\n \n\nI concluded, \"And all that's playing out simultaneously in my head. But I'll want to get through it, so I'll try to plow on ahead, except now all this anxiety and all these thoughts have made me tired and overwhelmed. So I'll need to take a break or read reddit. So I'll stop and I won't come back to it. It will be one of the many tabs open on my browser window that I won't come back to and will be lost when the computer restarts.\"\n\n \n\nShe looked bemused and a little taken aback. \"That was remarkable,\" she said.\n\n \n\nThen she said. \"Can you just move to the next sentence?\"\n\n\"But which next sentence? The next sentence where I'm focusing on the battle plan? The one where I'm focusing on European history? The one where I try to learn about the difference between tactics and strategy? The one where I try to learn what Napoleon's goals were if he won the battle, or if he lost because he had bad luck?\"\n\nShe didn't say anything for a moment and then changed the subject.\n\n \n\nWe'd also talk about my week and what I'd done, and she'd take notes.\n\nI'd say that one of the things I wanted was less social anxiety.\n\n\"I've played tennis in the summer, and I've been playing with some of the same guys for years. And I get nervous talking to them afterwards. There's this guy, he seems to be a nice guy and we've played a lot. After the match is over, when we're just talking when we confirm the score, I get super-nervous. I'm trying to make small talk, but I get really anxious. And he mentioned how there was this restaurant not too far away that was a good place to get something after a match. I don't know if it was an invite or he was just mentioning it, but whatever. I'd like to get over that. \n\n\"Or the anxiety getting out of my apartment, or going to meetup groups. I'll show up, on the rare occasions I go to one, and I'll get more and more nervous the longer I'm there, until I have to leave.\n\n\"But it doesn't even have to be either of those things. I went to this museum when a friend of mine was in town and I got there first and asked one of the volunteers there something about the tickets, and as she was answering my question, I got super-anxious talking to her. Even though she's just answering my question and that's it. I wanted the conversation over and her to go away, even if she didn't tell me what I needed.\"\n\n \n\nSo she and I would talk about that kind of stuff, and she wouldn't say anything new or interesting. She made a few small suggestions like giving myself permission to leave a meetup group when I started to feel uncomfortable. Yup, already got that, thanks.\n\n \n\nAfter awhile, I got annoyed with her bad memory, and not engaging in a way I found interesting, and her cheerful, engaged boringness, and not getting what I was saying, and her going \"yaw...yaw...yaw\" and the time boundary thing, and I got passive-aggressive. I'd make comments about how I knew that before, or complain about her memory.\n\n \n\nAlso, she'd often start a session late, because her previous patient had run over. Or I'd often be late. No matter what, though, \\*I\\* always ended the session right on time. Time boundaries are important.\n\nThey are, but there's also a note of passive aggression to leaving right on the dot. Also, I hate therapy, so I was happy to leave.\n\n \n\nOne day, I said, \"I'd like to try something. Can we just sit here silently? Just not saying anything?\"\n\nShe looked surprised, but she agreed.\n\nSo I did a session in my head with her. I'd say something in my head, and she'd reply. It was much better that way. Her imaginary self said some good stuff. And she never forgot anything, or misunderstood what I was saying.\n\nPassive-aggressive as fuck, but they were also good sessions. I'd leave them feeling satisfied.\n\nYou could ask why I can't just do that at home, but there is something about doing it in an office with someone there, like working in a library or an office versus at home.\n\nShe asked me what was going on, and I explained. I said it was strange, but it was working for me.\n\n \n\nAfter another session or two, she broke the silence, \"this is unusual. I've been in sessions before where the patient is angry and not saying anything. There's a lot of tension in the air. But this isn't like that.\"\n\n\"No, and I know it's strange,\" I said, enjoying her discomfort. Ha, I was getting to her. \"But it is working for me right now.\"\n\nSo I continued this way for another session. Again, I left feeling like it was a good session. I'd had some good thoughts.\n\nDuring these sessions, she tried looking over her notes.\n\nDuring another session, she broke the silence with, \"I'm puzzled. Therapy involves talking and communicating, and we're not doing that. It's a very strange way of doing things. It doesn't feel tense, but it does feel unusual. So I do have to say, I'm puzzled.\"\n\n \n\nI was annoyed. \"You're not puzzled; you're uncomfortable.\"\n\n\"No, I'm just wondering how this is going to work.\"\n\nAfter a little more back-and-forth, she admitted she was uncomfortable.\n\nI'd won again. Sure, passive-aggressive, but I was also pissed off. She was either lying about her feelings, or confused about her feelings. For a therapist, not a good look.\n\nSo we started talking again, which I kind of regretted. I did enjoy the silent sessions, and, even aside from the passive-aggressive, bitter satisfaction of them, I did get something out of them.\n\n \n\nWe did talk about my past, a bit. She pointed out that things were fine until I was 12 or 13, so what happened?\n\nThat was kind of interesting.\n\nBut she didn't do ambiguity well. When I talked about my parents, and said they were both good and bad, she tried to commiserate about the bad parts, but I said, \"well, them being clueless as parents was bad, but on the other hand, they did encourage me to find out what I wanted to do, and they were fine with almost anything, if I could figure it out.\"\n\nUnlike so many straight-up abusive parents, who don’t mean well or try hard.\n\n \n\nShe didn't know what to make of that. She struggled understanding that something can be bad, but also have an upside, too. Or that if you're not sure if something's is good or bad, that confusion can it itself be more harmful than straight-up abusive parents, sometimes.\n\n \n\nEventually, I got to the point where I decided that she wasn’t smart enough to give much in the way of insights, and she wasn’t smart enough to have concrete suggestions on how to deal with my anxiety in its various expressions, and she couldn’t really even suggest activities for me to do.\n\nBut okay, I thought, what we can do is work with the transference/counter-transference stuff.\n\n \n\nI mean, I've been annoyed and passive-aggressive and frustrated, and that's something to work with. I’ve never had a female therapist, so that's also something to work with.\n\n \n\nAlso, she had some schizoid family member that maybe I remind her of or something, so there's something there.\n\n \n\nThat's kind of the point of psychodynamic therapy. I don't need a life coach or a CBT-let's-change-how-you-think-when-you're-feeling-anxious type of thing and I don't need a sympathetic there-there-its-okay kind of thing. But the you-remind-me-of-my-mother-and-that's-how-we-can-work-through-my-anxiety-at-making-progress or people-make-me-anxious-so-maybe-this-interaction-will-eventually-lead-to-being-less-anxious-when-the-stakes-feel-lower type of thing is mostly what I'm here for.\n\n \n\nBut I got more frustrated as she didn't seem to want to or be able to engage that way. She'd ask about the tennis guys I never was able to just hang out with, and the meetups, or about my (very occasional) travels, and stuff.\n\n \n\nThen one day as I was telling her this was frustrating, she asked if she could talk to one of my previous therapists.\n\nI was reflexively against this idea. It made me uncomfortable. But then, I thought, well, that's good it makes me uncomfortable. Plus, we need all the help we can get.\n\nSo I emailed him and he agreed to talk to her.\n\n \n\nThe next session I asked what she talked about with him.\n\n \n\nShe said, \"it's obvious you've got a bond with him. You two got along very well.\"\n\nI looked at her. \"That's it? I mean, that's everything? But I already know that.\"\n\n \n\nThat was everything she could remember. That was really weird. I’d seen him for 4 years.\n\n \n\nSo I emailed him and asked him what they talked about. He wrote 3 paragraphs back about telling her how I struggled with progress, and this one time where I was driving to a dance in town and I got less and less excited about it as I got closer to it and so forth. He did say that she was smart and energetic.\n\n \n\nAs they say on Reddit, wtf?\n\n \n\nSo the next session, I told her what he said. She said, \"I'm sure it's in my notes.\"\n\n \n\nWTF? In your notes? Not doing anyone much good in your notes.\n\n \n\nSomething wasn’t working. In one of the next sessions, I asked her, \"what do you think of our relationship?\"\n\n\"That's a strange question.\"\n\n \n\nI was floored. That is the opposite of a strange question when it comes to psychodynamic therapy. That's one of the most - perhaps the most - important questions.\n\n \n\n\"It is NOT a strange question,\" I said. \"It's, like, one of the most fundamental questions of therapy: the relationship between the therapist and the patient.\"\n\nShe said, \"it feels like you're insulting my competence.\"\n\n\"Well, isn't it one of the most fundamental questions?\"\n\n\"I agree there was probably a better way to answer it.\"\n\n\"Okay, great, here's your chance: what do you think of our relationship?\"\n\n\"It's progressing.\"\n\n\"It's progressing? Okay. That's not better. \"\n\nShe smiled. \"Okay, what would a better answer have been?\"\n\n\"I don't know, it's up to you to answer.\"\n\n \n\nAfter a little more back-and-forth with me feeling like I was in some parallel universe where therapy doesn't exist, I couldn't take it. \n\n\"I really want to leave right now.\" We had 15 minutes left.\n\n\"We have time left.\"\n\n\"No, I'm weirded out enough that I really want to leave.\"\n\n\"Well, why don't we talk about it.\"\n\n\"There's nothing to talk about. We're so far from being on the same page, it's just...so, I'm going to leave.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nI left.\n\nWe had another session that went nowhere fast, and after that, I left a trip for 2 weeks.\n\n \n\nWhen I came back, she seemed happy to see me.\n\nShe asked about the trip.\n\n\"So, you went on a trip for two weeks. That was a big deal for you, how was that?\"\n\n \n\nI replied, \"I haven’t traveled like that for a long time. Yes, it's probably a sign of progress. Progress that's been happening for years. But I want to talk about your answer to what I thought of our relationship.\"\n\nShe was surprised. \"I would think you'd want to talk about your trip and how that went.\"\n\nI was annoyed. That's what YOU want to talk about. But that's not going to help me.\n\nI wanted to talk about her thinking our relationship was a strange thing to ask about.\n\n \n\n\"So, let me ask again, how is our relationship going. Why is talking about the trip more important than that? Our relationship is the basis for a lot of what goes on here.\"\n\n\"Our relationship arises from our work together.\"\n\n\"Uh, in part, but it also stands on its own. Like, you could have two people meeting for the first time and talking for 45 minutes, and at the end of that, they'd have some kind of relationship.\"\n\n\"That's a pretty artificial example.\"\n\n\"I mean, when I asked the question, you didn't even do the therapist-flip thing and ask, 'why do you think you want to ask that right at this moment?'\"\n\nShe nodded. \"That would have been a better way to handle it.\"\n\n\"So why didn't you?\"\n\n\"I think I was responding to the hostility in the room at the time.\"\n\n \n\n\"We have a communication problem. We can't even agree what therapy is about.\"\n\nShe replied, \"I don't think we have a communication problem.\"\n\n \n\nThis confused me. I mean, if one person thinks there's a communication problem, and the other person doesn't, is that, by definition, a communication problem?\n\n \n\nAfter a few more exchanges, I started feeling really confused and weirded out and irritated.\n\nI finally said, \"we can't continue. We have to stop working together, since we can agree on the most basic things.\"\n\nI added, \"Or we need a consult. It's either that, or we just stop this, because I can't go any farther with this.\"\n\n \n\nSo she agreed to have someone mediate. She asked if I wanted one of my former therapists. I said no, because I didn't want someone that might be biased in my direction. I suggested someone she knew.\n\n \n\nWe worked things out over email. To their credit, they both offered to meet at her office, or at his, or do a zoom call.\n\nI suggested a zoom call, which would be easiest.\n\n \n\nSo, the zoom call comes around. I'm the one that's hosting it, and I've never hosted a zoom call. I made an account and everything.\n\n \n\nI laid it out, explaining the whole thing.\n\nShe talked a bit, and didn't say much new from my perspective.\n\nHer colleague basically said, “the reason she's reacting like this is because of you. You're the one that's making her react, you need to work on how you present yourself.”\n\n \n\nI was like, “wait, I'm the patient, and I'm supposed to watch my behavior because of my impact on her? That's kind of not how therapy's supposed to go, right? I'm only supposed to be looking out for myself, right?”\n\n \n\nHe said, “you need to be mindful of the transference and how your aggression is causing her to react. The dynamic is valuable and you need to see your place in it.”\n\n \n\nI was annoyed. He was using all these clinical terms, and when he wasn't using them, he was implying them.\n\nI said, \"you say I'm causing her to be shut down. I know what projective identification is. But that's not my responsibility to govern that. That's something that's supposed to be helping me, not the other way around.\"\n\nHe said, \"you need to be more conscious of the dynamic and the similar pattern in your own life and with your own parents.\"\n\n \n\nI got defensive and snapped, \"yes, I know that I felt my parents fundamentally misunderstood what it was to be parents, the same way I feel SHE is well-meaning, but fundamentally misunderstanding what therapy is.\"\n\nThey both nodded sagely, which further annoyed me.\n\nI added, derisively, \"I already figured that out last week.\"\n\nAt one point I said to him, \"you're using a lot of clinical terms. You've used the word 'transference' like, 10 times during this call. Do you always talk this way to patients?\"\n\nHe said, \"I do when they're sophisticated.\"\n\nI replied, \"there must be a lot of very sophisticated therapy patients around here.\"\n\n\"Yes, there are.\"\n\n \n\nShe wasn't saying that much. I was frustrated. I said to her, \"so, when you said, 'that's a strange question.' That was a strange response.\" I added, \"even he thinks it was a bizarre response.\"\n\nHe said, \"I didn't say that.\"\n\nI said, \"so you DON'T think it was a bizarre response?\"\n\n\"No, it's not that I don't think it wasn't an odd response, what I'm saying is that she was responding to your aggression. You need to be conscious of the effect your aggression has on the dynamic.\"\n\nDuring this whole time, it was more me and him talking. I was looking at her on the zoom, and she looked kind of sad and despondent.\n\n \n\nI did find the whole thing really interesting, though. We were half-way through the call when I saw the \"record\" button on the zoom call and thought, \"man, I'd really like to record this.\"\n\nSo I clicked the button, and this toneless voice said, \"Recording of call is commencing.\"\n\nDamn, was I the only one that heard that?\n\nHe spoke sharply, \"who's recording?\"\n\nShe smiled, which was the only time she smiled during the call.\n\nI was embarrassed at being caught. \"Uh, sorry, no, there's no recording anymore.\" I clicked the stop button.\n\n \n\nAfter about 45 minutes, he said he thought she and I should continue to work together.\n\nI said, \"but I don't think she's willing to do the transference-countertransference work.\"\n\nHe said she was. She agreed that she was willing to keep working together.\n\nI said to him, \"how to you know she's willing to do that sort of work?\"\n\nHe said, \"because I've known her for 30 years.\"\n\nOkay...\n\nShe broke in, \"I have another patient in 5 minutes.\"\n\n \n\nHe said, \"I thought we had an hour.\" He was talking with energy, like he didn't want to end the call. I wasn't as psyched as he was, but I wanted to continue arguing with him, because I kind of thought he was full of crap.\n\nHe seemed like he knew his stuff from a theory standpoint, which was more than I could say for her, but I was frustrated that he was all jacked up on the theory and blaming me, and not paying attention to her reactions.\n\nShe said, \"I allotted the same as a regular session for this, so I really have to go soon.\"\n\nI said, \"tell you what, let's call it now.\" I thanked them both, and we said goodbye.\n\nHuh, the one time she holds the time boundary.\n\nI later wondered if I could have recorded the call using my laptops video recording.\n\n \n\nI thought about the call for the next few days and concluded that, yup, I should fire her. She doesn't want to do the work that I want to do.\n\nI also thought he did a bad job with the consult. He walked in with a preconceived notion that I was the problem and she wasn't at all. Not surprising, therapists often see their colleagues through rose-colored glasses.\n\nMaybe part of it was he was being protective of her, but maybe not, since he also wanted her to keep working with me which probably wouldn't be good for her ego.\n\n \n\nI wrote a polite email to the both of them thanking them for the consult, telling them both that I didn't want to keep working with her, but thanking her for her hard work. I also asked them for any recommendations for other therapists, and, if I needed to pay them for the consult.\n\nHe didn't reply. She sent an equally polite email back with no recommendations, but charging me for the consult.\n\nFair enough. I mean, she didn't charge me for the time talking to my former therapist.\n\n \n\nWell, that’s it.",

    "title": "I need to talk to someone but have to dredge it all up again after bad advice from a therapist!",
    "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nTW: SA, DV \n\nI’ll try and keep this as brief as I can but basically I (33F) had a terrible relationship with a man who showed his true colours when we bought our first house and his behaviour scared me to the point I left during covid in very early 2020. I tried online dating for a while and then NYE 2021 (I guess that’s why it’s on my mind) I was SA’d. \n\n\nWasn’t the first time as my ex partner used to do similar without consent and this time I met a strange man online dating. We’d been talking a while and had arranged to meet for lunch the next day then he phoned me at 11pm demanding my address and he was sending an Uber for me. I could tell he was drunk but he wouldn’t take no for an answer and my self esteem was on the floor so I gave him my address and went. He terrified me and messaged me the next morning like nothing had happened asking when we could meet again and I did block him and told him exactly how scared I was and his behaviour was unacceptable. He was aggressive but not physically violent if that makes sense. More intimidation and I just allowed it to happen.\n\nI literally just went into fawn response and let him do what he needed to do then sneaked out in an uber at 3am. But he was confused and I didn’t realise/remember how traumatised I was by it at the time. A couple of friendships broke off because they couldn’t understand how I went along and did that without telling anyone where I was going which I understand but I really needed support at that time, even if I did bring it on myself. I wasn’t expecting to be put on the spot like that and should have just blocked him there and then but you live and learn. \n\nAnother friend set me up with a newly single person shortly afterwards who was very respectful and we shared the same humour etc. but he moved quite quickly and wanted me to move in 8 months later. I was struggling with this feeling it was too soon so I went to a therapist to see if it was me being scared to commit after bad experiences. I did outline some behaviours I found troubling as well. She had been recommended word of mouth by two separate people who didn’t know each other. \n\nShe advised me I was behaving like a rescued dog who didn’t know it was safe to get back on the bed. Ok so I moved in. Fast forward 3 years he was sectioned (uk term but a psychiatric hold) once for the things I initially raised as a concern and started displaying the same behaviour again a year later and I felt very unsafe so I left again November 2024. I was under the impression he’d worked on all his issues but in reality he’d attended only some appointments and then just won me back over when I was very vulnerable. He accused me of allsorts on police body cam when they had to attend then retracted it all and I made a disclosure under Clare’s Law (again UK thing) and found out all of this was far from new and in reality he’d been keeping up appearances for months to win me back. \n\nAnyway I want to OBVIOUSLY avoid forming such an unhealthy attachment again. I’m not ready to even think about seeing anyone so soon but I do need to work through what happened with him.\n\nMy question is do I go back to the original therapist who told me it was safe? I did continue to see her but haven’t for a few months now as everything seemed to be ok. But I feel like she steered me wrong and what I raised initially was valid, but if I go to someone new I have to start from the beginning again and that will be exhausting!\n\nI’m not an idiot and I’m well educated to university level so I just feel so stupid about all of this and don’t want to start over from scratch. I’m just too trusting (clearly) and don’t want to make the same mistakes again going back to a therapist who told me it was nothing to worry about, but the alternative sucks as well.\n\nWhat would you advise?\n\n",

    "selftext": "Hi Everyone, five months ago I let my therapist know I was bothered by some advice she gave me and she apologized immediately. She seemed to feel super guilty which I didn't mean for at all and at one point I asked her how she felt and she said sad because she doesn't know how many other clients she's impacted with this. Later on in the session I started to say \"I feel like...\" and she cut me off and said \"like you need to leave?\" and I was taken aback because that wasn't what I was going to say at all. And from there I started freaking out that maybe she needed to leave and that's why she was saying it, that I had shouldn't have brought up my concerns to her, etc. After the session I was really worried about what I had done, and I had also seen a side of her that I hadn't before which let me dysregulated too.\n\nIn the following session she asked how I felt, and said that she had actually shown her emotions deliberately as part of an advanced therapy technique (I forget what it was called). And she let me know that it is always okay for me to leave sessions if I have to. I felt annoyed hearing that it was deliberate,  since that had left me so dysregulated. But I was also super confused, since I really didn't realize this.\n\nI felt super bothered but couldn't put my finger on what for. So I ended up talking to my friend and she was like dude what? And then sister was even harsher, saying \"Does your T lacks boundaries? Your T isn't supposed to start doubting herself when you bring up a critique lol\"\n\nAnd then...I just couldn't stop perseverating. I got super suspicious of my T and weeks later I finally decided to bring up the situation again. But I was really confrontational about it and I even told her it was inappropriate what she did. And she cut me off and said \"I'm saying this because it's starting to get in the way of our relationship. I CONSTANTLY feel like a witness on the stand with you\" And I froze immediately I felt like the world was spinning and I saw how wrong it was for me to communicate with her in this way. She made a face and said \"Do you do this in your other relationships?\" And I said that I didn't think so or if yes then I haven't been told that. And she immedately responded \"What about your last therapist? You talk about her a LOT.\"\n\nI didn't have problems like this with my last therapist, and it ended because she doesn't work with my diagnosis. But I felt really defenseless at this point and I also just felt really bad that I made my T feel so awful that she had to break character. I've since expressed how sorry I am, and told her that \"I'm sorry. You didn't deserve or invite in how I treated you\" and the rupture is repaired I think. \n\nBut, it's been months, and I still perseverate over this. To the point where I now lie in bed and replay what happened over and over. I don't know what to do and I feel like sinking when I think about bringing it up. I know she'd be super receptive but I'm scared that a part of me feels anger and how she would react to hearing me angry at her. I just keep replaying how that session went and sort of want to rot away\n\nIf I could have some words of support that it's okay to feel angry, I'd really appreciate it.

I think literally a month worth of rescheduled (and then cancelled for 50/50 on the above reasons) appointments left me feeling abandoned and really not good at all.

    "title": "Difficult Session - Countertransference",
    "selftext": "I had an extremely difficult session this week with my trans F therapist. I am a cis WF and she has spent the last decade transitioning. I have had little direct experience with the trans community but politically I support LGBTQ issues across the board. In previous sessions, she's shared personal information about her life before transitioning which included living as a man, married with children. Last session, I made a generalization about married men (I am married and was referring generally to my partner) and in a knee-jerk response said, in reference to her, \"I'm sorry.\" This session, she said she wanted to share that she had been offended by my misgendering her as a man. She said she wished to \"clear the air to ensure there are no issues with the therapeutic relationship.\" \n\nI apologized and explained that my kneejerk comment was a rather awkward effort to acknowledge her experience living as a married man in my sweeping (negative) generalization, and to apologize for any offense she might take at that comment. I explained that in an effort to avoid offending her in one way I had offended her in another, for which I was sorry. She accepted this - I think? - but went on to explain what it means to be trans in today's society, especially post election. She asked me to \"consider what it must feel like to know that there are people who want to outlaw my existence\" and summarized what she feared would happen with the change in administration (including her fear of economic collapse). She emphasized that \"many people believe that trans is a lifestyle, not a biological fact,\" and I said, a bit defensively, that she shouldn't assume that I believe this, and that I understood and empathized with her concerns. I also noted that I have been trying to limit my exposure to politics post election in an effort to moderate my own anxiety, and often didn't know how to respond when she raised these issues. I also acknowledged my privilege in being able to silence the political news. \n\nShe reiterated that she had raised the issue because she didn't want there to be \"any issue with my treatment.\" When I asked her what she meant by this, and specifically whether she meant that she would be unable to treat me because I was not trans, and I don't feel I got a straight answer. She said she wanted a diversified clientele and said she still had \"unconditional positive regard\" for me, but she also acknowledged she'd had negative thoughts about me outside of session and joked (?) that I'd \"ruined her Christmas.\" I felt a bit panicked that she had assumed the worst about me for a whole week before asking for clarification. \n\nThis whole exchange took more than half my allotted time. I tried to salvage the rest of the session but in truth it was difficult because her being offended at me and feeling negative about me made me feel extremely vulnerable (this is a recurrent theme with me that I have been working on in therapy, ironically!!). I was afraid of saying the wrong thing and ruining the relationship further and wasn't sure how to bring it back to my therapy session, especially since I'd planned to discuss specific things, all of which vanished the minute this came up. And really, her fear of economic collapse triggered some anxiety for me, too. I ended up bursting into tears and telling her I wanted to \"disappear.\" She kept saying that she wanted to make sure this was a safe space for me to process these feelings, but the truth of the moment is that I didn't feel safe, although I said I did, mostly to appease her because I didn't want to say anything more damaging. After the session, she sent an article and podcast via text about issues related to the transgender experience, which I dutifully listened to and thanked her for. \n\nI am not sure how to proceed. I've been seeing this therapist for 2 years but the fact is I don't really care about her life as a trans person. I am there to work on my own issues, and I have made good progress (thanks to her). Having said that, I don't want to offend her and certainly don't want to add to her oppression, and I now feel like she assumes the worst. And also, she's human! She's allowed to have feelings. But then again - shouldn't she be processing this in supervision or her own therapy? Anyway - I'm ruminating. How should I move past this? I guess I'm interested in other people's thoughts. TIA",

I realized as I left that I hadn't gotten my usual text message from her automated system confirming my appointment the night before. I have had a crazy week so I didn't think to check that. But at the same time, I had confirmed the day of my next appointment with her. Photo attached. \n\nI recognize that I should have noticed that I didn't get the automated reminder and reached out to her. I also should not have said \"the holidays\" in my text.

He’s giving me a deal ($150 per session), and our sessions have always been about an hour in the past. However, due to health issues, I haven’t been able to see him in person, so we’ve been doing FaceTime video chats instead, which I’m fine with. That said, I’ve noticed that the past two sessions have only lasted 30 minutes. While I truly benefit from the therapy and find it amazing, I’m a little confused about the shorter sessions. How do I bring this up? Does anyone else do 30 min sessions? My main therapist is $50 copay but not as good but we get 50 mins. ",

    "title": "Is this normal for a therapist? Feeling abandoned and not sure what to do next.",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m struggling with something my former therapist did, and I’m feeling really hurt and confused. I’m hoping to get some perspective on whether this sounds normal and what I should do.\n\nI had been seeing this therapist (she’s an MSW, LCSW, PMH-C) for about six months. I started seeing her during my second pregnancy to navigate the challenges of motherhood, so I wasn’t a new mom. I already had a 3-year-old at home. In June, my mom passed away unexpectedly, just 10 weeks after I gave birth to my second child. It was devastating—not only was I grieving, but my 3-year-old was also mourning the loss of her grandma.\n\nThree months after my mom’s death, my therapist abruptly texted me suggesting that we “pause sessions” because she didn’t want therapy to “add stress” to my life. I was shocked because I never said therapy was stressing me out. The only thing I mentioned was that my baby was going through a nap regression since starting daycare, and I thought virtual sessions would be better so I could stay home if she woke up. I didn’t think this was a big deal, but apparently, it was to her.\n\nWhen I replied that if she thought a break was necessary, we could take one, she responded with, “Feel free to come back anytime,” and that was it. There was no phone call or in-person conversation—she just ended things over text. The whole thing felt cold and unprofessional, especially since we already had a session scheduled that I told her I was looking forward to.\n\nWhat’s throwing me off even more is that her website says she specializes in grief counseling and postpartum support. It feels like she didn’t handle this the way someone with those qualifications should have. I’m also wondering if her own personal life played a role—her mom passed away unexpectedly a few weeks before mine. I can’t help but feel like she was looking for an excuse to stop working with me, but I don’t understand why she wouldn’t just be honest about it.\n\nThis whole situation has left me feeling abandoned at a time when I was already dealing with so much—grieving, postpartum recovery, and supporting my young child through her grief, too.\n\nI want to be clear that I’m not interested in reaching out to this therapist or trying to repair the working relationship. The way she handled this has completely broken my trust, and I don’t feel safe or supported enough to consider working with her again. I’m sharing this here because I don’t want advice suggesting I contact her to clear things up—I’ve made the decision not to pursue that.\n\nIs it normal or ethical for a therapist to handle things like this? Should I report her to the licensing board? I’m in Missouri and considering filing a complaint, but I’ve never done this before and don’t know what to expect. Has anyone been through this process? What happens if they investigate her?\n\nIf anyone has been in a similar situation or has advice, I’d really appreciate hearing from you. I’m feeling so lost and hurt right now.\n\nThanks for reading.",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone, \n\nSo a little context! I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder type 2 and severe anxiety and depression few months ago. As I am 19 years old  and my family is not supportive enough to provide for psychiatric treatment I searched up a lot and decided  to go for psychiatric treatment in a government hospital ( I live in India so healthcare in government hospitals are completely free but most of the time patients in the hospitals are not given  attention or the treatment can be really substandard,  ) But I got really lucky and it turned out completely opposite as I am getting treated under  one of the best psychiatrist in my state. And in the first session with her she was really compassionate and she listened to all of my problems and gave me a lot of time( it is to be noted that most of the psychiatrists were giving 2-3 mins in listening to their patients whereas she was the only one who listened to all of my problems empathetically where I did not even expect for it to happen,  ) \n\nSo my psych told me to take therapy under a clinical psychologist in the same hospital, and it was my first therapy session today. I was really nervous and I expected the same or maybe more from the therapist . In  the beginning she asked me how I came to know about therapy and what brought me to therapy and stuff. And then I shared about my previous behavioural tendencies or things I did in mania and told her about my extremely low confidence and other issues . A lot of the things were really vague and she showed no expressions or signs if she was understanding or not and there wasn't much digging into things , which I thought she would like the psychiatrist did. \n\nThen she asked me what I wanted from therapy and most of the time it was me who was talking and she was completely silent . One more thing which I did not like was that she did not take any notes , just wrote\" history not clear, drug compliance explained. Engagement in activity of his choice suggested\" which made me rethink if it was really worth it or not whereas the psychiatrist was taking detailed notes and writing the complete history elaborately which I expected the same from the therapist. And later I got to know the therapist had experience of nearly 15 years of treating bipolar disorder and adhd and she also had mphil and PhD. \n\nSo I am worried what should I do ? Although it doesn't  cost me a single penny but still it made me rethink if it is worth going or should I look for other therapists??? ",

    "selftext": "I've been working with her for about 6 months and everything has been great, we've developed a good therapeutic relationship, I've let myself be vulnerable and cry many times, and I think I've been making good progress. I've never felt so grateful towards someone like that in a long time.\n\nA little bit of background. In last week's session I finally worked out the courage to talk about one of my fantasies that involved her and she disclosed that she would need to consult with her supervisor on which way to proceed with the therapy, because there are a few possible paths, while acknowledging that she valued the fact that I have shared the story with her.\n\nIn today's session, towards the end, I mentioned that through observing my fantasies (including that one I've shared), I've realized that perhaps I'm not secure with my manliness, and that maybe in my relationships with women, I have a desire for them to make me feel more like a man.\n\nThat is when she dropped the bombshell. She asked whether I thought I might be gay? She also added that, when she consulted with her supervisor, the supervisor ended up asking her \"Are you sure he's married?\" (I am).\n\nNow, this came as a shock to me for a few reasons. Firstly, gender has always been at the core of my identity (and it's also a vulnerable spot -- I've mentioned that I'm not secure with my manliness). Secondly, I have always valued her opinion a lot (and so by extension, her supervisor's opinion carries even more weight in my mind).\n\nI told her that when I was younger my gay friends have always flirted with me (for some reasons they assumed that I was gay -- maybe my appearance or my soft manner or other things) so I did for a while question my sexuality. But in the end I've concluded that I'm heterosexual since I've never felt anything about them, or guys in general. Went on a few \"dates\" (didn't know they were dates back then, I just thought I was hanging out with a friend) -- only to realize that they were \"dates\" after I realized they were gay.\n\nOur therapy session stopped at that point because we ran out of time. My next session is next week. But since then, I've been extremely bothered and anxious. I dreaded to think \"what if she's right?\". Will my whole world turn upside down? I even think of perhaps scheduling another session with her this week because I couldn't bear to wait for another week. But I decided against it because I think may be it's good for me to give myself some time to work through my feelings.\n\nBack to the sexuality question, I've been thinking about it for the whole afternoon and my conclusion (so far) is still that I'm heterosexual. I do enjoy heterosexual p\\*rn (may be a bit too much). I get a hard on at the sightest women's flesh (and never felt anything even when a naked guy were to stand in front of me). I enjoy sex with women (although I admit that I've never experimented it with men). I find my wife to be very sexually attractive and I'm in love with her deeply. But the question of \"what if she's right\" keeps bothering me a lot.\n\nI tried to cope with it by thinking that even if she was right, then I could be bisexual, because I clearly find women sexually attractive. Then I realized that I didn't only feel bothered and anxious, I felt a lot of sadness. It's because the thing I dreaded the most was that if I were gay, then I couldn't be together with my wife, and I love her so much and feel so happy in her companion (but if I'm bi then that's not a problem isn't it, lol -- now that I write about it, it feels so silly).\n\nI feel a bit better now but still quite bothered. I wonder how do I work through all these feelings while waiting for my next session?\n\nSorry for the rant, I hope I managed to keep it coherant.",

Since I started about three months ago I’ve found myself experiencing something that I’d like to get some perspective on. Lately, I’ve been reflecting on various moments from my past, especially from my childhood (which I don’t remember much of to be honest) that I used to view as trivial or unimportant. However, now I find myself feeling discomfort where I didn’t before. \n\nIt seems like I’m thinking about these events differently, and I’m starting to feel emotions like anger or sadness that I didn’t feel when the events actually happened. It’s almost as if I’m “re-traumatising” myself by digging into these memories and trying to make sense of them. It’s almost like I’m LOOKING for trauma in my past. \n\nI can’t help but wonder if this is a normal part of the healing process. Am I unintentionally seeking out trauma or looking for explanations for why I feel the way I do and why I do the things I do, when actually my past is no worse than the average and I’m just being a bit of a drama queen? Is it common to intellectualize one’s life in the context of trauma in this way? \n\nI’d appreciate any insights or experiences from this community of much more experienced insightful people . Thank you!",

But my family doesn’t really believe or know much about how to aid mental health (they say I should just exercise and pray more) and I’m really confused on where to start. Plus I’m going to study abroad soon. So should I find an online therapist first? Or should I ask a psychiatrist for medication? Or what should I do? I’m just really overwhelmed on where to begin healing.\n\nSome other questions I have that would be great to be answered are how can I find a therapist suited for me and my needs? Or what tips would you suggest for someone who wants to make a change but doesn’t know where to start? Or if you’ve personally also struggled with things like perfectionism and low self esteem and anxiety, what would you say has really helped you?",

    "title": "I dislike therapy and find it uncomfortable, and therapists find this hard to understand",
    "selftext": "I've had about over 10 years of psychodynamic therapy. I've worked with 6 different therapists.\n\nOne of the things they all seem to struggle with is that I find therapy uncomfortable and unpleasant. \n\nThey understand that therapy deals with intense feelings and things that are uncomfortable to talk about. They get that much.\n\nBut, for me, actually talking about personal stuff is uncomfortable. Therapy feels like an unnatural and threatening process. None of them really \"get\" that.\n\nI'm in therapy because I struggle with making friends, and working on things that are important to me, and enjoying things like travel. All that causes a lot of anxiety. More than that, when I do something social in the real world or I work on something I'm interested in for an afternoon, it's not only anxiety-inducing in the moment, I'll get depressed a couple of days later, like there's an additional bad feeling afterwards. \n\nI'm seeing a therapist now, and I said, \"do you understand that I find therapy \\*itself\\* uncomfortable? It's important that you understand that.\"\n\nHe looked confused, so I added, \"look at it this way: I'm afraid of progress. Therapy represents progress. It makes sense that I'm afraid of it. Also, one of the things I struggle with is forming intimate relationships of all sorts. Therapy is one kind of intimate relationship. So I'm uncomfortable with it.\"\n\nHe thought hard for a few moments. Then he said, \"yes, it's hard for me to understand that.\"\n\nIt really surprises me that it's so hard for him to understand such a basic thing. But the other therapists I've worked with also find it hard to understand.\n\nThat really frustrates me. If my therapist can't understand my feelings in the therapy session, around such a basic thing, then how can a therapist help me with my problems in the outside world?\n\nTo me, psychodynamic therapy is about the relationship between the therapist and the patient, about engaging the patients feelings and fears. But to therapists these days, it's about doing 1 of 3 things: Either being a cheerleader (\"good for you for doing that thing!\"), a caretaker (\"I know that must be really difficult to deal with that thing from your present or your past, tell me more about that\"), or being endlessly curious (\"tell more about that, I'm really curious\")\n\nThose are all really important things, and maybe that makes all the difference for most patients. But therapists don't seem to know anything about engaging with my fears and my defenses. Which is really weird. It's like they're more life coaches or social workers than actual therapists. \n\nI hate feeling vulnerable and talking about personal stuff. And when I do, and I don't get anything \"in return,\" like insight or an interesting thought or useful advice, I feel resentful and ripped off. Occasionally, they might point out a pattern or two that I fall into, but that's all they do. All they have is more questions. When I ask, well, is there anything else you can tell me? Or should I be feeling something besides frustrated? They reply that they're surprised I'm frustrated, they weren't aware I was frustrated until I spoke up.\n\nThen I ask, well, do other patients find this process less frustrating? They don't know the answer to that, either. They don't even think about questions like that. But aren't those the sorts of things therapists are supposed to learn about in school and know how to work with?\n\nI hate being vulnerable, can they help me with that? Or can they figure out why I have such a difficult time making progress in therapy? Or why I find it so unpleasant? I guess they just sort of assume that those things will all sort itself out eventually, somehow. Then they just keep asking questions about my past or how I feel in the moment. I tell them about it, at some length, then they pause and ask more questions, and I get more irritated.\n\nIt's very frustrating just powering through my irritation for weeks and months and not getting anywhere.\n\nI asked Claude, one of the AI programs, about my issues and struggles in life and therapy, and it told me about narcissistic and schizoid defenses, and about annihilation anxieties when talking to other people. I was like, well, that sounds on-point. I asked my therapist about what Claude said, and he said that he had heard about those defenses in graduate school, but didn't seem to know anything else. He went right back to, \"but I'm curious about your thoughts...how did you feel when reading about that...how did it affect you...?\"\n\nAt one point, I asked my therapist, \"isn't my resistance important, even crucial? It's the part of me that doesn't want to make progress, so isn't it important to engage with, to understand, just as much as the part of me that does want to talk and make progress? Like, isn't that kind of basic?\"\n\nHe looked a little bewildered and said, \"in some cases...\" and sort of trailed off.\n\nThen I said, \"I recognize that me talking about all this may be a defense of mine to avoid the work. Did that occur to you?\"\n\nHe smiled and said it had.\n\nI said, somewhat sarcastically, \"Good! I'm glad that occurred to you.\"\n\nNow, I've had 10+ years of therapy by this point, and 6 therapists. They all were ethical people, and eager to help and hard-working. Some of them were very intelligent. My comments in this post apply to all of them.\n\nTo get theoretical, from googling and from what Claude said, I get the idea that therapists these days believe in Winnicott, and not much else. They want to get to know the patient and \"see\" the patient, and be \"good enough.\" That's the whole ballgame. \n\nWhich is a super-important part, and maybe that's enough for most patients. But I get the idea that if Freud or Klein saw the state of therapy today, they'd be like, is that it? Like, that's \\*all\\* you do?",

Furthermore, she's in for a rough year ahead because she needs a hip replacement but first has to fight off the MRSA infection and then wait a year before she can do the hip replacement, which means dealing with severe health anxiety in the short-term future and pain management, physical limitations, and possibly social isolation for a year.

She need to rest and let her body fight this infection, but she has a lot of nervous energy and struggles to do so. She has a lot of dread about this upcoming year and we all feel angry and powerless. \n\nWhat types of therapy come to mind to help her cope with this? DBT? IFS? Somatic? EMDR? Pain management support groups? It feels a little too acute right now for her to get into something more existential or psychodynamic, but I'm just not sure how to advise.

My current T is nice and all and I've felt the safest with her so far. And she has known quite a lot of things about me compared to other people. I was with her since last year when she was a trainee and got back with her sometimes mid this year once she returned as a professional. \n\nI spoke with her about modalities and she's doing CBT (which I don't prefer) and ACT. After reading around and doing some window shopping, another therapist mentioned to me how I might benefit from PCT and psychoanalytic approach. But the latter is almost hard to find in my country, while a lot focused on either CBT or reality or choice based therapies. I'm not really into \"objective goals\" kind of modalities since I have no idea what I want to focus on. \n\nEach time I spoke with my T, I was reminded of how I felt seen and heard by her, which felt like a very valuable thing to me. Which was why I stuck with her until now. However, I can't get the nagging out of my mind to shop around for other Ts, who could give a sliding scale or better packages. Financial struggle is real. Or that maybe my T can't really offer what I \"need\", even though I don't even know what I want or need 🫠\n\nIdk what to do right now besides talking it out with my T about \"goals\", something that I've been mulling over with no answer or even an idea about what to do. I want to do something different in my therapy journey in 2025, so I'm at lost on what to do. The last time we spoke about this, nothing was resolved nor did I have a better idea on what to do in my sessions with her. \n\nThe only thing I know so far is that I just want to unpack things? There have been a lot of things I want to talk about, but I also understand that talking it out while having no action plan or anything would mean that I'm not ripping off max benefits from therapy. I thought that since I have no idea now, perhaps I should stop going until I know what to do with myself.

    "selftext": "For background, I have a history of mental health issues and drinking/substance abuse issues in the past but have been stable for years/off meds/haven't been in therapy in years partly because of lack of access. Definitely not mentally perfect as I still struggle with anxiety, adhd and residual c-ptsd but overall so much better than I once was. I have a 3 year old daughter with my husband. I've had health issues since having my daughter and think I may have Lyme's disease but everyone else just thinks I'm anxious and I don't currently have insurance. My husband's mom has a therapist that she always is praising- she's been seeing this therapist for almost a decade. My husband's brother also started seeing this therapist. His dad used to and now his step dad goes to couple's therapy with his mom to this therapist. My husband started having issues- or just more issues- with depression and anxiety and substance abuse etc and was thinking of leaving me because he thinks I don't like to have sex with him/don't have sex with him enough/doesn't feel like I love him or pay enough attention to him. So he decided to see the therapist with hopes of eventually couple's therapy for us. After his appointment, he made an appointment for me to see her separately without asking me, which is fine but kind of weird. So now we are both seeing her, separately. \n\nI've only seen her maybe 3 times so far, but can't help but feel very judged after every session and as though she is coming to the sessions with preconceived ideas about me and then I obsess over what my mil and husband actually think of me. During our first appointment, I didn't necessarily feel that way because it was a lot of background info of course. I said I was there for my husband and that he feels like I don't have enough time for him etc and I told her that I'm feeling overwhelmed and like I don't have time because I have so many other things to do with housework, cooking, baking, childcare, the dog and cat and yardwork and trying to get my small business running better. I'm mostly a stay at home mom with a side hustle. I feel as though he goes to work and I do everything else, including when he's off work. I told her if I could just get rid of excess things in the house I think it would be easier but I don't have time to do that without any help. \n\nAnyway, the therapist started saying things that implied I don't know how to cook or clean and that I'm low functioning and if I can't clean the basement in a month then it's really going to affect my daughter and I'm going to have to think about taking medication to help me clean the basement. (I told her that I wanted to clean the basement and my husband got his mom to babysit so we could but he put all the trash in a giant trash bag that couldn't fit up the stairs. He said he would take care of it and to not worry about it but it's been almost a year and he hasn't yet and my therapist said I needed to take all the trash out and put it in smaller bags and do it myself. ) I mentioned that my husband gets a day off and I never do and she asked me in an incredulous tone \"really? He gets a day off? When?\" And goes on and on about how she had two young children and did the housework and cooking and worked and got a masters degree, and she worked with another woman who was a single mom and cooked and cleaned and worked and did it all herself. She seemed to scoff at me saying I'm a feminist. When I said my husband was very messy and throws his things all over and pees on the floor and leaves his dirty dishes and garbage wherever he sits etc and I expressed that I wished maybe he could at least put his dishes in the sink and his clothes in the hamper etc, it would give me more time for him- she asked why I was even with him then if that's what I think about him and do I even love him. When I said I did a lot of things around the house, she looked shocked and was like \"and what exactly did you do all day yesterday?\" She asked if I had never been taught basic life skills like cleaning and cooking. I can't help but think my husband or mil claimed I can't clean and cook. I think I'm a pretty good cook and spend hours cooking and baking from scratch. Many other people have complimented me on these things and have even paid for my baked goods. My house is constantly in a state of being clean and dirty as with a toddler and a dog, it gets dirty again as soon as I clean it. However, I think overall my house is pretty average in terms of cleanliness. My stepmom views my house as so clean that it makes her feel bad about hers but my mother in law rarely comes over and when she does it's always somehow when my toddler has just torn everything out and I'm in the middle of the dishes. So I don't know what she thinks. My husband acts like it's messy and dirty sometimes because he is maybe too critical of me even though he is known to be extremely messy. Some things that the therapist has brought up are almost word for word things he has said before we started seeing her, like that our house is small so it should be the easiest kind of house to keep clean although I personally find it harder with less storage space especially with a small business. Overall, I feel like I am seeing his therapist and like she is biased against me and am feeling bad about myself, like I'm a lazy disorganized failure.\n\nI've brought up some of these concerns with my husband and he thinks I should give her a chance and that I'm overthinking it. He says that she probably is just trying to help me be more organized since I said I wanted to declutter to have more time for my marriage and that I could use time management skills since I have ADHD. So I really don't know if I'm being hypercritical of perceived judgement as I am a perfectionist or if she is being judgemental or if maybe people shouldn't see the same therapist as their family?

I told him about it, we had a session then he was off for holidays. Before he went, I was so sick in my stomach due to abandonment/shame issues that I told him I can’t see him again. Then a week later emailed him explaining what happened and wanting to resume therapy. \n\nI’m currently losing my mind as this whole limerance situation is undoing all of the things he’s taught me (including changing my internal voice) because I’m trying to forget him. Part of me wants to run away and other part knows that this is because we are getting to the root of the issue. At the same time I have repeated nightmares about my past traumas and I don’t know how to self soothe and 1 hour a week therapy session doesn’t cut it also considering the next many sessions is gonna be about erotic transference. I’m even thinking to quit therapy as I can’t afford to open these old wounds and being asked to “feel my feelings” without knowing how to care for it/properly handle it, every second.\n\nAny advice is welcomed x",

Her sessions are very expensive, and it's taken me a lot to get to the point where I feel confident in saying that I shouldn't have to feel like my therapist is annoyed with me.\n\nEight months ago, my husband and I also started couples therapy with the same therapist. We have been very committed to therapy emotionally and financially, and were seeing her every week at first, and then every 2 weeks once we started working through a bit more on our own. We have never once been late, always come prepared, and she has even commented that she can tell we are both giving therapy our full energy and effort. My husband is also a very calm person who is not easily offended, and even he has noticed her negative attitude in sessions over the past few months. \n\nWe have canceled 2 appointments this year (with months between each instance) due to genuine emergencies: once in the Spring because we both contracted Covid (provided 4 days notice) and another this week because of a family emergency my husband had to fly out for (with over a weeks notice). We offered to pay full cancellation fees both times due to her annoyed replies to our emails, despite there being a 48 hr cancellation policy. Despite giving reasonable notice and explaining why we needed to cancel, her reply to the recent cancellation was, \"I'm sorry to hear that your personal scheduling complications have impacted your ability to proceed with therapy once again.. See you at your next appointment.\" This response felt unnecessarily passive aggressive and bothered both of us. If it was a one off, it would still feel oddly aggressive. It was actually my husband who voiced his concern about it first, because I didn't want to be the one to make it into a big deal if I was being too sensitive (working on this), so I stewed on it until he got home from work and we had a chance to discuss it.\n\nWe're just confused. We've been very consistent, on time, and very committed to therapy. It has helped us so much, and I don't want to discredit that. However, we feel her reaction is unfair and disrespectful. If we're arguing semantics, she has also canceled on us twice with just an hour notice, has been 10+ minutes late multiple times without any kind of acknowledgment upon entering the room (concerning since we both usually take unpaid time off work during the day to meet the needs of her schedule), and she also didn’t warn us she would be unavailable again until the New Year when we had our last session at the end of October. We both felt that it was inconsiderate to not let us know she'd be unavailable for almost 3 months for a planned trip, when we'd been seeing her every 2 weeks during the year up to that point and it was never mentioned as a heads up. It's not an issue to go on vacation for 3 months, and I'm a big supporter of taking time off work for as long as you need and can. It was the lack of communication on top of everything else that bothered us when it happened, and this recent email feels like the last straw.\n\nBetween personal and couples therapy, we’ve spent nearly $10k this year with this therapist. We've long surpassed benefits this year. We like her but if she is going to have this off putting attitude towards us in every interaction, we feel it's in our best interests to move on. We have an appointment coming up in early Feb, and we're debating whether to discuss this with her to give it another chance, or to just proceed with the  appointment and thank her for everything, and let her know it'll be our last session. We both feel that she would be defensive if we brought it up, and don't know if it'll change the way we feel or make it even more uncomfortable. I definitely want to give her the respect of saying thank you for everhthing and this will be our last session, but wondering if we should just maintain a positive tone without getting into the specifics. Unfortunately, in considering how passive aggressive she has been towards me both personally and towards me and my husband together, I don't know if she is in a place where sharing this feedback with her would be conducive to either party. \n\nWhat would you do?\n\nTLDR: My therapist has been consistently acting irritated and annoyed in both my personal and couples therapy sessions, which I feel has made me dread appointments and hold back in sessions. My husband feels very similarly. After a dismissive response to a recent emergency cancellation (despite us being very consistent clients), my husband and I are debating whether to address the issues with her or find a new therapist.\n\n\n",

You’re sitting there, and the therapist gives you advice that feels… fine but generic.

Like, the sense that they’re just saying what they think you want to hear, or they’re running through the steps their education told them to, and you’re also playing along.\n\nDoes everyone go through this? How do you make therapy feel more meaningful and avoid that surface-level dynamic? Is it about finding the right therapist, and does that just mean they’re *better* at making their suggestions sound authentic?\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts or experiences. ",

My partner did whatever, whenever. I dissociated a lot.

I did not want him to and I told him this, but he was trying to convince me and I gave in. I dissociated. He eventually realized this and stopped. I pointed out afterwards that I felt like what he did wasn't appropriate, that he should have listened to my wishes and we agreed it wouldn't happen again. More time passed, weeks, months, no sure. I was sick with covid. He was kissing me and made it obvious he wanted to do something. He pushed me onto our bed. I was hesitant, told him no. He said just fingers and not oral this time, that it would be fine, that he just wanted to make me feel good, etc. He pushed me back and again, same thing happened. \n\nHe also has a history of lying. Two years into our relationship, he came out about a bunch of lies he'd told.

Particularly in the event of a client expressing concerns of fleeting thoughts/suicidal ideations. Key word being the literal definition of ideation, or rather \"idealizing\"-  meaning the mental glorification of an event but no plan nor active threat of harm.\n\nI want to be clear, despite fleeting thoughts, I'm not planning on doing anything to myself... Especially because I'm acutely aware that suicide is not covered in life insurance claims and God forbid, in the event of my death, I want my family to be taken care of. \n\nBut I also don't want this to be questioned by the content of my sessions during online therapy, in the unlikely event that I do pass. Thus leads me back to my original question -- are chats or online sessions recorded/saved, and can they be used for those purposes?",

    "selftext": "I have been attending group therapy for about a year. The group consists of one therapist and 8 clients including myself. There is another client who annoys me so much that this becomes the primary reason I want to leave the group. This person has been in this group for 20+ years. The therapist cares about him deeply. In her words, he has made huge improvement. Any suggestions on how I can politely raise the topic of leaving without offending anyone if possible? \n\nI recognize the annoyance is likely due to my own bias and my past trauma. That said, I just can't stand him. He is in his mid 50s, never has a relationship, holds an entry level job, rents the same flat for 40 years since uni and has no friends. The only social interaction he has each week is talking to his mom on Sunday and joining the therapy group. He regularly takes up half of each session because there is always something 'bad' going on in his life. His progress seems nonexistent to me. I cant help feeling that time is better spent letting others talk instead. I can notice the improvement of the mental wellbeing of other members over the past year whereas he seems to be constantly stuck.\n\nI hate people who are fearful of any challenges and who soley reply on others to resolve their emotional struggles. They remind me of my parents. I feel nausea when I recognize someone like this is nearby. Whenever he talks, I automatically disassociate. I recently had multiple nightmares featuring this person. On the days I have difficulty of getting things done, I have flashbacks of him nagging and crying in the sessions about his life going nowhere. Then I worry that if I don't pull myself up immediately, I will become a 'loser' like him. This thought gives myself no breathing room to properly relax. I have personal therapies twice a week anyway so I just want to leave the group one. How can I bring this up politely without saying out loud he is such a loser that he makes me sick (a very biased and judgemental view of mine)? I've made up some other excuses of leaving before but the therapist insisted I stay. I may need to tell the truth. ",

    "selftext": "I'm 29M - My 20s were filled with grief and pain beyond words. I suffered from medical malpractice after getting groomed by a therapist which turned into a legal issue. She destroyed my life at one point in 2022 by trying to cover up her actions by lying to the police about me. She was like a mother and always reassured me that she would never abandon me but that's for a different post. Then years ago she turned into a monster when I finally confronted her about her actions. Now I have to face her in court soon.\n\nIn 2024 after years of emotional and physical torment I\n\n(Unintentionally) got my hair back from acupuncture\n\nFinished a 5 month welding course while I was unemployed\n\nStarted my career at a Power plant (not welding)\n\nGot my professional license\n\nGot in WICKED good shape\n\nReconnected with an old friend who I do Brazilian Jiu Jitsu with again now\n\nMade a new great friend at work who I can’t imagine living without now. Even though I have 6 siblings, she's the only one I bought a present for this year (she has a wife so I could not date her).\n\nIt was a WILD year.\n\nOn the outside I seem great. I’m the guy at the gym that knows all the employees and fists bumps everyone - same at work - I’m the funny guy that makes people laugh. Whenever I meet someone I really try to take an interest in them and their life and I’ve met some great people because of it in a casual sense - mostly immigrants from Africa, middle East, Asia, and Latin America - those are my tribe.\n\nThe harsh reality is that because of years of mental health issues in my 20s I alienated friends and family members. I’m also on the spectrum *(which people need to* ***stop sensationalizing***), and it’s a nightmare. The communication barrier makes it next to impossible to form romantic connections even with looking good, having a great career, and being upbeat and positive. I’m constantly rejected romantically - 100%. I’m so beat down from constant rejection and the trauma of my old therapist and that I’ve forgotten what sexual attraction even feels like. Additionally, new therapists turn me away when they hear how intense my entire life story is - not just what I’m posting on Reddit. Most of them seem to think that being a therapist is like being a barista.\n\nI’ve tried so hard to become the person I needed to become in order to attract a girlfriend and none of it has worked. Something is fundamentally wrong with me/broken. And now we’re in an age of romanticizing loneliness which we NEED TO STOP and how **“You have to be happy being alone.”** Terrible Advice! News Flash! To quote the author and retired war reporter Sebastian Junger: **“Primates do not survive in nature alone. Humans don’t. Other primates don’t. If you are alone in the natural world, you die. Our strength…comes from the fact that we exist in groups. We don’t have claws, we don’t have sharp teeth, but we can band together… and in groups we survive.”**\n\nHaving a girlfriend/boyfriend is not a luxury or trophy. It’s a human need. In case you’re wondering, yes, I’ve tried every app under the Sun, I’ve “put myself out there” and continue to try to even if I’m at the gym or anywhere there’s people. I’ve tried improving every area of my life and personality and looking for every flaw to improve on because I have some pretty bad ones. And even after endlessly grilling myself - I’m at a loss for words with things to fix. I’m exhausted and frustrated beyond description. The touch starvation feels like my skin and throat are starving for something that can't be mended. I can’t bear going to sleep at night alone anymore and hearing about friends and family members starting families and getting engaged - the pain is inconsolable.\n\nI don’t want to sound spoiled or entitled because I know that there are other people who are going through much worse so oftentimes I feel very guilty for expressing the amount of pain I’m in. I used to work in a group home so I’ve seen the horrors of the worst of human nature. But none of that can quench the pain of romantic loneliness and knowing that this may be my life forever even if I try my best and give everything I have. I’m single, sexless, and clueless as to what I need to do. I tend to miss the obvious as well. It feels like the Universe is conspiring to keep me single. The self-improvement and authentic kindness I continue to show to amazing people isn’t attaining what my soul is craving - a genuine romantic sexual connection.\n\nThroughout my life I’ve already survived sexual assault as a 6 year old from my grandmother, 10 years in a cult as a teenager, a rescue operation in Maine when a canoe trip went bad, malpractice, an undocumented psychosis, 4 seizures from bad medication, 2 unalive attempts, betrayal, etc. In some ways I feel immortal, but the romantic starvation has become too much. I’m sure some of you reading this might roll your eyes but the reality is that I feel like my soul is withering away. Like all my efforts will amount to nothing. Even though I know it’s unattractive - I’ve become desperate. Not for shallow sex, for real connection.\n\nAlthough I do love and am very proud of myself - I feel as though no one else loves me and can see the love and support that I can provide them. I'm completely clueless as to how to approach dating. The clock is ticking. I’ve run out of options. SOS",

    "selftext": "I've been seeing my therapist for over 3 years now , he helped me survive med school (just finished it last juin) , taught me how to deal with the great amount of pressure that I face daily in uni and at the hospital , helped me get through many depressive episodes , helped me understand my symptoms and how to function properly despite them ect.. \nHe's one of the greatest human beings I have ever met and I'm super grateful for everything he's done for me and also very attached to him as i consider him a great role model and see him as a father figure to some extent , however throughout the years I noticed that when my symptoms are related to anxiety or depression he takes things very seriously but whenever I complain about my struggle to focus he completely dismisses the issue and says I should apply the therapy techniques to reduce anxiety hence my concentration will get better. I brought this issue up a billion times and it's always the same reaction as if he refuses to take it seriously. \nThis year , I had to study many months for the final and most important examen in my medical career and obviously I struggled to focus and couldn't get things properly done , so I impulsively decided to go and get this ADHD test done (it's a scientific test like the IQ ones so I'd be reassured that I didn't subconsciously manipulate anyone into diagnosing me with ADHD just so I can take adrell for the exam) I went and got it done and the results showed that Ido have ADHD so naturally before seeing any other psychiatrist I emailed him the results and hoped for a response . But he never emailed me back , so I called the next day and asked him if he saw the report he said yes and asked me why did I go and get the test done at such a critical time, I said that I was confused and wanted to know if I actually have a problem with focus or if it's just because of my crippling anxiety , to which he answered \"well I'm not a specialist in ADHD but there are alot of psychiatrists out there you can go see one of them if you'd like , good luck \" and hang up the phone .\nI need to clarify that that's so out of character because he plays such a fatherly figure in my life and even when I piss him off he tries to give me the right advice kindly , he was never this cold and not caring , which after second thoughts made me think I offended him by getting the test done and it came out as if I meant \" well you didn't diagnose me right so I went and got the real diagnosis done \" but that really isn't the case because this test is only done by neuropsychologists and he isn't one .\nOne more important thing you should know, he's a psychiatrist so he's allowed to prescribe drugs but he has this whole anti prescribing meds unless you really really need them ,  which is an approach that I deeply appreciate because it helped me push through everytime without relying on any chemicals , and I know he wanted me to push through this one last step of medical school on my own because it would be essential for my growth and character development ( if this amount of pressure doesn't break me then we're one step closer to being a highly functional anxious person), but being a doctor myself I thought that I shouldn't have to go through so much mental torture to get where I need to get , so if I aderall is going to make me focus like a normal person does why not take it and save the energy I waste on just trying to focus , on something else . \nHe never agreed with that point of view and once said that people who rely on drugs to get things done are spoiled kids and I'm not one of them and I need to keep pushing through and learn how to survive life in general despite my crippling anxiety and without any drugs . \nNow that the exam is over , I tried calling and he didn't pick up , I even wrote him an apology email and he didn't respond, and I feel so hurt and heartbroken and I really can't fathom the idea that that was our last conversation, that I won't even get to say goodbye , and I feel super guilty because I'm starting to think I was acting like a spoiled brat and that what I did was wrong because I should have just pushed through and went through all the pressure like a grown ass adult and that it would've eventually made me a better person , like he believed. \nAm I right or wrong ? \nShould I go and try to see him at his office ? \nShould I write another apology email? \n",

I have no one to turn too, and I don't even know how to bring up all of this to the doctors when I go in for my last session.\n\n  \nI just want some help to know how to take the next steps, I want to get better, but I don't want this feeling of abandonment to last.

    "selftext": "I’ve been doing sessions with my current therapist for a little more than a year. The first 3-4 sessions she kept the camera on and after that the next session she said “can we do over the phone?” I said “sure”. After that phone session when it was time for our next session I texted her asked right before session if it’s going to be over the phone she said “yes”. We kept having phone sessions so far. I always kind of had a weird feeling about the phone sessions, but for some reason wasn’t brave enough to bring it up. She never even once asked me if I’m okay with phone sessions only. I’m paying a lot of money for a session until my insurance kicks in and I feel like it’s not fair that I have to pay a lot of money and have phone sessions and want to switch therapists. One could say that I should bring it up with my therapist and tell her that we should have video sessions instead, but I feel like if she thought that having video sessions is important she would’ve done it long time ago. I told her I have very low self-esteem/self-worth and struggle socializing. I need her to pay attention to my body language and my facial expressions because I’ve been told by multiple ppl that I have a very unapproachable face and tense body language. Some ppl after taking to me for about tell me that initially I had a face as if I was disgusted by talking to them. My therapist knows the things I’m struggling with and considering all those things I think it’s very necessary for us to have video sessions. Should I switch therapists or tell her that I need a video session?\n\nAnother concern that I have is when after about 20 mins km done talking about something that bothers me we she asks me “what else is going on?” I say “nothing really” and we sit like that in silence for half a minute or so and then she just asks me about my mom or my sleep(I have sleep issues). What bothers me is that she never goes back on topics that we had talked about in the past sessions the ones that we didn’t finish because time was up. I feel like if I have tell her this as well then it’s like me teaching her how to help me. Is she not a professional who’s already supposed to keep track of our previous sessions and bring them up here and there? She says she has 20 years of experience but sometimes feels like she doesn’t put any effort just expects me to do all the work",

I know that it’s not shameful to have feelings or fantasies about your therapist bc if the nature of the relationship and what it brings up and all that. But the other day I feel like I crossed a line. I actually masturbated and got off thinking about my T. What’s worse is I liked it. It felt good. \n\nThere’s a huge difference between thinking something and acting on it. I know that she’s my T and I don’t know her as a real person and that these feelings are entirely one-sided. I would never hit on her and have no delusions that this will ever be a real thing. Still, it feels like masturbation is acting on it in some way that’s terrible and wrong. I don’t know if that’s just shame talking though. I can’t tell what’s right anymore.\n\nThoughts plz! Thank you!",

She’s there to help me process my feelings and I feel about my tasks but not necessarily helping me create the plan for execution.

    "selftext": "So me and my therapist are both Muslims, different sects tho , yesterday in our session we we were trying to figuire out the reason why i engage in bdsm , even tho its not something i really want and want to stop .  But before all this i have sent her a message , not understanding myself scared of judgment or anything , even though she has told me amd really is trying to make sure the space is safe for me . And in that message i discussed my sect and how i was afraid she'd leave me bc of it , amd my sexuality amd bdsm . She said religion isn't something she cares about and its not something she's going to make part if the sessions obv , but it might be a part of the reason why its hard for me to stop or it may be part of it or idk i honestly forgot what she said exactly. But then she asked me a question if something thats part of my sect if my relegion , since i mentioned in the text that i listen to it quite a bit and that its comforting, i can maybe see why she asked , if it had a part in it , but really? I mean i don't think she knows or understands my sect much , obviously i wouldn't expect her to . But it hurts, when she asked. Ik she was trying to understand me more and find a reasoning behind it . And i don't think i want to change therapists? I mean i feel comfortable with her and i like her and she tries to help me alot and challenges me just right. But im feeling so mad amd angry and hurt by her , bc why ? Why would she even ask that . \n\nI think im going to try to talk about it next session but its 23 days away ughhhh ( both of our vacations are opposite of eachother so💔) . I don't really speak alot, but she has been encouraging me to speak and much more honestly to help . She even said to me why she pointed something out, that i do act dramatically at times , and when we talked she said i obviously know you aren't this horrible person who doesn't like her parents or anything , but that she reacts this way bc shes misunderstood, and that she pointed it out bc she wanted me to speak, i think she might be doing the same thing. But ugh this is making me so furious what she asked. Im not sure how to feel and i so wanna run away and curse her and im so mad and hurt by that , and ik that won't help me so thats why im not going to do it . \n\nAnd for the message that i sent , she told me do you know whats the role or rules for the therapist and client 1-no judgment from both sides 2-if the therapist can't help they will find someone to help 3-that the client can leave the therapist if they don't want or if they find they aren't receiving the help they get ( ngl knowing that helped , i mean i like her and she helps , but im an overthinker haha soo ) hopefully i speak about it next session , if i don't the one after which will be soon lmao after the one coming by 4 days or something. Honestly a huge part of me regrets opening about my sect and telling her , it stings \n\nBut ughhh any advice or insights please 😣, esp knowing its 23 days away uggghhhhhhh . \n\n\nTL;DR I told my therapist about my sect( in my religion, both if same religion but diff sects) , sexuality, and BDSM struggles in a message, and while she’s been supportive and clear about creating a judgment-free space, she asked a question in our session that really hurt me. She wanted to know if something from my sect might play a role in why I struggle with BDSM, and while I understand she was trying to understand me better, it felt invalidating. I feel furious, hurt, and unsure how to process this, but I don’t want to change therapists because I feel comfortable with her overall, and she helps me a lot. My next session is in 23 days, and I’m trying to figure out how to handle this, and honestly i kinda regret opening up about my sect and telling her , it stings . Any advice on how to cope or insights into her perspective would help.😣",

    "selftext": "I'm using one of my alternative accounts for this.\n\nI have had a strong attraction to my therapist, which shifted into an erotic transference. I had brought that I was having transference a few weeks ago and it seemed like it was a brief, surface level dialogue, almost like he was avoiding the topic. This happened in subsequent sessions as well. \n\nToday, when he did the usual check in, I decided to speak up. First about how the reason my response usually lukewarm is because there are so many aspects in my life that are going well, while I am also deal with things not so good so it's like trying to judge things by taking an average score - like getting low Cs in math and science and an F in English but lots of As in electives does not mean you are a B+ student. He picked up that this was not everything and asked me which topic I wanted to address in today's session.\n\nWe talked about how I felt liike a tunnel with a huge round stone blocking most of the flow... that some small things could trickle past, but most things were still stuck behind this obstacle.\n\nHe admitted that he had felt the same thing, that I had been holding back and that yes, it seemed we touched on things briefly on a surface level, but nothing really deeply.\n\nThen he asked what was the biggest obstacle holding me back. I admitted that it was my erotic transference for him and the fact that we had never really addressed it.\n\nWe discussed what was my version of him in this transference and why I felt this strong attraction to him and looked at what was in this idealized version of him I had created in my fantasies and how it connects to my own marriage.\n\nIt was such a constructive, open, shame-free conversation. I had been worried that it would not go well and that he would end the relationship, but I feel today we made a shift in addressing the therapy itself for the first time and about how I see him metacognitively.\n\nI walked away from today feeling like that obstacle had loosened quite a bit and that, while we still need to work on this transference issue, there's finally progress being made again.",

But I know it's good for me so I've been working hard at being vulnerable and brave to trust her to guide me through this. I have an amazing therapist and she's been truly so calm and patient. So today I really finally opened a deep door of some deeply upsetting memories, which led to crying and being frozen to the point I couldn't say anything. Which was also terrifying, and embarrassing. It was like my brain just wouldn't work. It's a deeply vulnerable state to be in. But I was sitting in those difficult emotions and letting her see the messiness. \n\nAnd then there's a knock at the door. I'm on telehealth with her so she's like I'm sorry just a moment. So she gets up and apparently there's someone delivering flowers. She says out loud, with the delivery driver right there (whose male voice I heard talking to her about the flowers) and the door open, \"I'm so sorry [my name], I'll be right back.\" \n\nI know a first name isn't PHI, but it's a unique name and it really unsettled me 😢 plus hearing a random male voice within this safe space, in such a vulnerable moment. \n\nI totally shut down after that and truly stopped responding bc I suddenly felt so unsafe, but I didn't want to make her feel bad by saying how I was feeling. She's truly such a kind person and I think she might feel TERRIBLE if I told her how it affected me. But after like 10 minutes of her trying to figure out why I was suddenly totally withdrawn- is it because we're near to the holidays, etc- I finally told her 😢 and she was like \"oooh that makes sense I'm so sorry.\" Ugh. I know she probably feels terrible. and I feel like all of my months of progress in a way have been wounded due to feeling like my safe space was violated. \n\nI have a tendency to be overly sensitive so I'm sure I'm being dramatic, but also I do have intense CPTSD and was talking today about intense childhood abuse stuff. I just really felt the need to share this and maybe somebody can relate and offer some encouragement. I'll definitely process with her at my next session too, but it's on Friday which feels like an eternity away. I just wish she could hug me and affirm that it IS a safe space despite the mishap.

I've had transition issues to graduate school and, after I had issues with my first PhD advisor in my second year, I've been active on Reddit ever since then. A lot of the active academic subreddit users even compared me to the infamous Snooroar, which is surprising given he's had hundreds of alts and dozens of posts daily that take up his entire day. Even when I asked mods on those subreddits if others were tracking me similar to Snooroar, they said no one was at all, fortunately.\n\nAnyway, I shared this Reddit account to my current therapist (who is neurodivergent affirming). She didn't have time to read everything since she's so busy, but she said the main thing that stood out wasn't the activity. Instead, it was my tendency to depict myself in a negative manner and bringing up all of the negative stuff I've done or perceive to be negative.\n\nIn my latest session with her (yesterday), she asked me whether I was being kinder to myself. I genuinely am not aware whether I am being kinder to myself in recent posts and I made sure to told her that. She then replied that it would take some time before I become aware of when I'm kinder to myself.\n\nHow can I handle this? How can I be kinder to myself and be aware of it too?\n\nI should note that I've had negative self talk for as long as I can remember. My parents (father in particular) and undergrad life coach used a lot of negative reinforcement as well, which may have lead to me internalizing that tendency too.

Idk what to do because I don't wanna text her and ask again because I don't want to bother her. ",

    "selftext": "Today, in therapy, I told my therapist that I recently noticed a few of my women friends, who are otherwise very liberal, \"fuck the patriarchy\" types, talking about how they're attracted to alpha males. I was very confused and upset by this, and I'm wondering if women are generally aware of how this misandrist term limits healthy masculinity. When I talked to one of my friends about it, she was genuinely surprised that I found it offensive. \n\nMy therapist, who is also a very liberal woman, also expressed her surprise when I mentioned this, and even disclosed that she and some of her friends will use the term \"alpha male\" when talking about men they find attractive.\n\nAside from the fact that \"alpha male\" is scientifically inaccurate (it was originally used to describe wolf behaviour, in now widely discredited research), it gets used a lot in the so-called manosphere, which is a hotbed of sexist and anti-feminist rhetoric. PUAs, MRA,s \"Red Pill\" advocates, incels, etc. will use the term \"alpha male\" as the exemplar of what men should be.\n\nIt just seems to me to be a very weird contrast, seeing it used favourably by misogynists and feminists alike, and I'm genuinely curious as to how widespread its use is in general conversation.\n\nAnyway, I appreciate your comments and perspectives.

    "title": "Therapist called the police on me",
    "selftext": "Hello all. I really wanted some advice and opinions from the people on this subreddit. I've been working with my therapist for almost 3 years now. I live in an extremely dangerous environment with my narcissistic abusive mother. Throughout my childhood she would abuse me mentally, emotionally, and physically.  She's gone even more insane ever since my father passed away 2 years ago. I have been extremely suicidal over the years. My therapist knows all of this. I am in the process of going no contact with my mother. My mom is an extremely dangerous person and this is the most intense situation I've ever been in in my life, to the point where I have the police involved. I've been under extreme amounts of emotional distress. I've told my therapist about my suicidal thoughts and I've said some extreme stuff like talking about buying a gun for self defense. My therapist has tried to force me to go to a mental hospital. I already told her I'm working with the police. When she found out I lied to her and that I was not in a mental hospital, she called the police on me. I saw her today in session and I told her to fuck off because I'm extremely angry with her right now. She then terminated the sessions with me. For the past couple of weeks, I've been working intensely trying to get my affairs in order. All my necessary documents and I'm leaving the state. I understand that therapists have ethical codes that they have to abide by, but I'm completely alone in this and I have zero emotional support from anyone in my life. She keeps telling me to \"hang in there\" but I can't do this anymore. My mother is an extremely dangerous person, and I just feel like my therapist doesn't understand this. This is a situation where I wish she would treat me as a human being instead of a client. I'm very angry with her right now. I told her the last thing I need right now is to be put in a mental hospital. I told her that the police already came and questioned me, and determined that I'm mentally sane. I talk about killing myself, but I've never actually formulated a plan to execute anything. Despite all this, she still called the police on me. She says she cares about me, but if she actually cared about me as a person, and not as a client, I feel like she would drive over to the extended stay hotel I'm staying in and check on me herself or not even that, but she could atleast call me throughout the day to see how I'm doing. I feel very heartbroken right now and sad. I feel bad for telling her to fuck off, but at the same time I feel very angry with her. I'm not okay mentally right now, but these are necessary steps I have to take in order to be free from my moms control. I have been 100% honest with her throughout these years, but me telling her that I was in a mental hospital when I wasn't was the first lie I ever told her, and I did it so that she wouldn't call the police on me, and she still did it. I feel very conflicted about this situation. Any advice or opinions would be appreciated.",

I think I genuinely wish we had met as friends first sometimes because I have always just longed so greatly to be seen and fit in, so it makes me incredibly sad to find this person that I can’t actually be friends with, and then to hear them reference some of their own friendships(always when prompted), i just feel extremely jealous.

Once I even told her a pretty traumatic story and felt really shitty having to remember and stammer it out just for her to forget it and now try to get me to tell it again every session. \n\nShe also repeats the same statements/ pieces of advice or anecdotes. For example, she has this odd idea of me being some type of genius and will tell me how I just feel misunderstood by others because I am smarter than them or how depression affects me more because, as I think more, I also have more negative thoughts. This seems like some kind of silly flattery and I don't get the intention, it's awkward and almost puts me under pressure to appeer intelligent somehow. \n\nFor some reason though, as I feel more uncomfortable, I've started instinctively trying to please her more. I nod and smile and say the things I anticipate she might want to hear. Today, as the conversation wasn't flowing, she went from asking me questions about my plans for the holidays to the ethics of flying in modern times. I found myself giving some generic political statement that matched her opinion just so she would keep rambling and I would get through the session without much trouble. \n\nI know it isn't supposed to be like that, I'm supposed to voice my complaints and she tells me that every session to which I also smile and nod. Today she even told me about her client this morning who blasted her for always yapping about the unimportance of appearance and how she still likes that client. \n\nSo she might be intuiting something. I don't really know how to fix this situation? I've basically been deceiving her into thinking I like her or her style of therapy while slowly also losing any respect for her. Telling her all the things that bother me horrifies me, it seems like the most vulnerable thing to do plus it would probably get really awkward. Should I just terminate? Thanks!",

She listened patiently and asked if I’d thought more about what would have been helpful and I said yes. It took almost the whole hour for me to get the nerve up to actually say it but I told her that I really just wanted her to say she was there with me in the moment and I was safe. \n\nAnd she didn’t get upset! She said that it was totally understandable that I would want that. She said feeling alone and unsafe are hard enough things separately so feeling them together must have been really difficult.

Is this weird?\n\nI'll do a very oversimplified recap for each switch:\n\nThe first one I switched because she kept telling me she didn't know what to say when I told her stuff and had a happy go lucky attitude she seemed to want me to imitate when it's impossible for me right now. \n\nThe second was because I went MIA for a couple of sessions (I felt incredibly depressed and couldn't get out of bed) and when I finally apologized and paid what I owed him, he blocked me.\n\nThe third one was because I felt like I was \"doing nothing\" in our sessions and when I talked to her about it she blamed my psychiatrist and basically said it was because of him that I'm not making any progress. She's been having an ego battle with him since I started seeing her (two times per week) and that became another source of anxiety and stress for me. Besides, I realized seeing her felt like a chore and I had the constant sensation I was speaking out loud things I already knew and nothing was changing (I understand therapy can be a lengthy process, but her response to my issue surprised me and disappointed me). \n\nI had my first session with my new therapist and felt super comfortable. I'm really hoping I can stick with her, but I still feel somewhat ashamed of having switched therapists three different times in the span of the less than six months. Has this or something similar happened to any of you? I appreciate any opinions or experiences!",

    "selftext": "Just this last Friday I had my final appointment with my therapist that I’ve been seeing for almost 5 years. She’s been there through so many stages of my life. I miss her so much and I feel like I can’t function without her. \n\nDuring my time seeing her I began to develop feelings for her. I started to obsess about her and I’d be thinking about her all day and everyday. It got to the point where I only wanted to go to therapy to see her. I would literally count down the days until I could see her. Whenever we would have to reschedule an appointment or if we had to do a virtual appointment it would make me feel upset that I couldn’t see her in person. \n\nSeveral months ago (maybe close to a year ago) I told her about my feelings for her. I told her everything about how I feel about her. She was very kind and understanding when I told her this. She asked me if I thought this would get in the way of therapy and I blatantly lied to her and said it wouldn’t. I lied because I was worried she would refer me to someone else and I didn’t want to stop seeing her. So we continued therapy. \n\nThe feelings got so strong and on this last Friday I told her that I should probably stop seeing her. I admitted to her that I lied about it not getting in the way of therapy. I told her how my feelings for her never changed and got stronger. I told her that even if someone else came along in my life, I wouldn’t be interested in them because I just wanted to be with only her. I told her how much I would miss her. \n\nI began to cry uncontrollably in her office at the thought of never seeing her. I never cried this much in my life. She also cried a lot too. I’m just so sad that I’ve fallen in love with her and now I’ll never get to see her again. I don’t know what to do, I feel like she was such a huge part of my life and now she’s gone forever. I’ve been crying all day the entire weekend and I can’t take it anymore. I miss her so much. She told me I was being brave for doing this, and that it was for the best for me. But honestly with how I’m feeling now I’m not sure if it was for the best. \n\nEvery night I wake up multiple times in the middle of the night and cry myself back to sleep. I’ve began to have more and more fits of anger and sadness and I just can’t take it anymore. I wish I didn’t terminate our therapy and I wish I could see her again. I am in so much pain. I feel completely broken without her. I really do love her and I wish I could see her again. \n\nSorry for the long post. I don’t expect anyone to read all of it but I think writing it down will help me. \n\nUpdate: I just scheduled an appointment with the new therapist that my original therapist referred me to.

    "title": "Couples therapist ruined my dream of first Christmas and New Year's with my boyfriend at our first home - how do I process the despair and move on? ",
    "selftext": "Hello,\n\nA regular reader of this subs, and now turning to you for some encouragement, support and advice.\n\nMy boyfriend (30M) and I (28F) started couples therapy in October, after we moved in together earlier this year and started having difficulties. Our primary issue has been the imbalance in the relationship when it comes to friends and family — I’m an immigrant, while my partner is not. He has a large group of friends he calls his family and hangs out with often—usually every weekend, plus two or three evenings during the week. We've had many situations where I felt neglected because friends seemed to come first. \n\nWhen this started happening, I felt surprised, then frustrated and later full-on angry. As weeks went by, I developed anxiety about the relationship which transformed into panic and anxiety attacks. That's when we started couples therapy. \n\nI knew my boyfriend does not mean harm and he does his best. We likely have a huge incompatibility issues - but it also seems he is unconsciously uncomfortable with the emotional intimacy of the relationship. Whilst having a wonderful relationship before we moved in and my parter being thoughtful, romantic, active ad engaging, once we moved in, the opposite happened and I only get glimpses of the man I fell in love with. \n\nI've been in my personal therapy for four years, so I am well aware how much one brings to the table from their childhood. I hoped couples therapy helps us find a way to nourish our relationship again. \n\nHowever, since we started, the focus has been only on my anxiety as a cause root, not a symptom. Whilst I am considered to have heavy anxious attachment by the therapist, she believes my boyfriend has a secure one and validates his behaviour by that. \n\nNow to what happened - Earlier in December, I suggested spending New Year’s with my family, but my partner said two weeks’ notice was too short and the therapist later agreed. I respected that.\n\nI have been so excited about Christmas and New Year's. It's personally and culturally a significant time of the year to me, and the week between the 24th to 1st is the best week in a whole year in my eyes. I decorated our first home, baked 200 Christmas cookies, wrapped all presents - you can imagine.\n\nHowever, on the day of our last pre-christmas session, my partner received a fourth invitation to his friends’ events between Christmas and New Year’s and it triggered my anxiety again because there were very little plans for us, and many plans for his friends. I brought this up in therapy and the therapist said that my anxiety was too high again, we were stuck in a negative cycle and that I should leave for my home country to \"pause the relationship\" for several weeks —just four days before Christmas.\n\nI understood why there is need for a space and I have no issue with that. In fact, we planned for me to leave at the beginning of the January and the therapist knew that, yet she still insisted that it should be before Christmas. \n\nI felt so shocked that I did not advocate for myself well and when the session ended, I felt absolutely devastated. First, two weeks’ notice for him to join my family felt unreasonable, but me leaving with only four days' notice apparently isn’t. Second, one thing is to ask someone to take a train and be home within a hour, another one is to ask someone to fly last minute two thousands of kilometres.\n\nAfter this, I could not imagine I would ever put energy into planning and preparing Christmas with someone I love again. I have found this so incredibly traumatising and struggle every day since. \n\nThankfully, my partner recognised that, and we found a compromise of me leaving on the 27th. But even then, every time when I think about the situation and the fact that I leave in a few days, my chest physically hurts and I cry. \n\nMy partner emailed the therapist, raising some of my concerns, but she insisted on her point that this is good for us, and that the relationship would not survive it otherwise and that she is thinking of me, and wants to get me better. Well, I have never felt worse in this relationship than now. I meditate an hour a day to somehow get me through this, but the pain is so intense that I can barely bear it within my body. \n\nI know that the break will help our relationship and us individually - whether we stay together or go apart, but the end of the year being taken away from me in such insensitive and harsh way is too difficult. I feel so much despair, sadness and hopelessness and it is a little consolation that if we improve our relationship, next year I can experience what I have hoped to experience this year. \n\nI am drowning in pain, anger and feeling of injustice. How can I find acceptance and peace with all this?\n\n",

I struggled with anxiety and PTSD at the time. It was a professional relationship to start with, however she would slowly get more personal in her communication with me until I was very emotionally dependent on her and was essentially being a therapist to her (she would tell me very personal stories of things that happened to her that related to what caused my PTSD, leading me to feel that I needed to ‘help’ her as well).\n\nShe also would tell me to date adults as I was ‘mature’ for my age (I know now it is not appropriate to tell a 15 year old to date people in their 20s), however it led to many instances of me seeing people as a minor that were way older than appropriate. It has been a pattern I have struggled to break due to this.\n\nIs this grooming behaviour? I feel I need to tell someone about this but I don’t know what to do. Thanks!",

    "title": "Silent therapist. Why?",
    "selftext": "I wrote this down some months ago but never posted it but I want to do it now. In short:\n\nmy therapist stays silent in our sessions and I find it unhelpful. Why does this happen? What is this technique a part of, which branch of psychology does it belong to?\n\n I realise I should’ve perhaps asked the psychotherapist rather than online but our sessions are very sparse because it's public healthcare (I was assigned her at random) and not that long (not sure how long they’re supposed to last but probably ended way early because I didn’t have that much to say) and I wont be seeing her again since I’m going abroad. \n\nAs context i have treatment for AN with both a psychotherapist and a nurse for about half a year maybe about six sessions total until now. And not once did I find the sessions with the therapist helpful; I understand that it’s not a lot of time and that we need to understand each other and everything, but every time she would ask me about my day and stay silent the whole time, only humming at my responses; I would’ve appreciated some kind of input, because it felt like a waste not to have some kind of response from a professional. Silence only goes so far, in my opinion. Maybe the silence was meant to get to know me, or get me to open up, or to see where I would guide the session, but for example when I would speak and tell her about my current hardships or stuff that had been happening lately if the topic strayed a bit from AN (which makes sense because AN is not the root of distress but a maladaptive symptom because of trouble in other areas in life that both is fed by them and feeds into them, so it's hard discussing it in a vaccum) she'd cut me off and switch topic, even though I was answering a question SHE had asked. \n\nWhen she did ask me questions they felt very judging and patronizing, so I always ended up feeling misunderstood because she was usually very direct and tactless, maybe so that I would be honest by being surprised, I don’t know. I’m aware this sounds very subjective, but from my point of view, rather than hear what I was saying (and maybe give guidance or something) she would twist my words or try to find another message to it or whatever you want to call it, but she would always get caught into really benign points rather than the main issue im struggling with. I’m a language student, I love pragmatics and everything linguistics, I completely agree that nothing is said in a vacuum and that one can find meaning in everything and that there often IS … but it just didn’t feel meaningful, I never learned anything or found myself enlightened. I felt like she didn’t know what to do. It’s hard to explain, but if you want a weird analogy it was exactly like in video games like Phoenix Wright where you can go off keywords in a dialogue to get more info… and can ask info on the wrong keywords, which are the ones that really don’t have much more, rather than the ones that give you a deeper understanding and clue you in what’s going on.\n\n  \n Nothing I said was ever discussed in depth, it all felt very uneventful. I know the right thing would’ve been to ask, but it was my first time ever going to therapy and I did not know how it works or what to expect, so I thought I'd trust her first. I still don’t really know, now. It has left me feeling as if either she’s incompetent (maybe too harsh, probably untrue) or that I’m a very hard patient to deal with (I still kind of doubt this, because with the nurse everything was a lot smoother, and a lot of trust was built despite the lack of actual progress made, but it’s not a race). Being honest it was very likely that we weren’t a good fit or that it was too little time. \n\nIf anybody is asking why I was even going in the first place it’s because I was told to go by a doctor due to health issues and I gave it a try. I wasn't allowed to stop the sessions, even though I wanted to, because they said due to my health I was at risk of being admitted into a facility, and that wasn’t something anybody, much less myself, wanted. \n\n  \n\n\nI don’t know if the silence she was trying to find out my own knowledge or perception about my condition but I often felt she was the one that lacked the knowledge or didn’t show it; I was at the same time having sessions with a nurse and although she never said anything I wasn’t already aware of, I did find myself a lot more emotionally involved and heard and mostly understood in our sessions, which made them tougher but also (probably) a lot more effective and overall helpful; although not much changed I did learn that I had someone who I could confide in and possibly ask for help or send a call or email if I was ever struggling, which wasn’t something I ever ended up doing, but the knowledge that I COULD was what was helpful.  \n\n\n\nI am in treatment for AN and for example my therapist would constantly ask if I wasn’t worried about myself, or if I didn’t feel bad about what I was doing- I think these questions are very foolish. People that know about Anorexia know that you can be rationally aware of your behaviors and still find yourself engaging with them, wether because it’s something that you reinforce with every disordered action or because it’s a way to both self harm (so you don’t care about yourself) or numb yourself (maladaptive coping mechanism). It’s exactly that worry and that guilt caused by it which in my experience ends up feeding the self punishing behaviors, which again doesn’t make any sense, but such disorders rarely do; it’s not something that be solved by rationalizing it. The nurse of course knew all of this, and although she still asked me similar questions, it felt a lot more different because after I opened up, she would talk about how those behaviors are connected and how they harmed me, while being aware that those were things I was also conscious of. It wasn’t eye opening, but then we would make agreements to slowly expose myself and change patterns of behavior and a lot tougher to swallow but also more enlightening. There was also a lot more encouragement; Today was my last session and although they both asked me what my plans are and both wanted me to continue treatment in some other capacity abroad, my nurse wanted me to understand that if I work hard it can be a small bump in the road no matter how much big it might feel while my therapist, again, just hummed at everything I said.\n\nWith all of that said, what I’m asking is, is humming and silence like that a thing that happens a lot in therapy? I’m vaguely aware that there’s a lot of different branches and techniques of therapy, does silence adscribe to one or some, and if so which? To others that found this method unhelpful or helpful, why? And what methods could work instead? I’m going to go back to try to deal and solve my issue on my own but it would be nice to know, mostly because I’m curious and I enjoy reading research, academic articles, journals, studies, etc.",

    "selftext": "To clarify, it's just something I noticed upon undergoing this, and it bothered me how much I'm distant from people my age. It's tough striking up a conversation with anyone or even try developing these into a deeper bond because I don't share their interests and vice versa. Most of the interactions I could recall were short and indifferent but had a lot of confused/weirded-out looks.\n\nWhat I could describe growing up is that, other than being a wee toddler, I wasn't allowed to go outside because I lived near a busy road and that's seen as not too safe to play, so I was just sheltered with TV. Both parents were usually too tired from work to bother me being alone playing with my toys, so I was mostly babysat by my grandmother. My parents noticed my loneliness, so they gave me my brother, they thought about having a \"playmate\" as a brother would help as they said.\n\nMoving on, another reason my upbringing would make me more alienated was the many times my family repeated the issue of money to me as a motive to do my hardest and best in school. The problem is that it made me turn anything into a serious competition and see others as antagonistic. I could go on and on but that could sum up my time growing up and struggling today to make a meaningful connection.\n\nMy T already knows this but is currently going through my checking mental assessments, so with me coming up to this conclusion I want to know what other professionals would say about this situation and give me similar situations because it's hard for me to stay convinced of trying to heal instead of continuing to act normal.\n\n(Apologies if this sounds vent-y, I'm trying to get used to posting here on Reddit. Also if this isn't the right sub to ask please say.)",

    "selftext": "**TL;DR:** **I've been in therapy for 4.5 years, built a trusting and safe relationship with my therapist after a long, difficult process, and made progress addressing deep attachment issues. Recently, my therapist expressed concern that the relationship might be causing me more harm than good, though she left the decision to me. I'm devastated and feel stuck, hopeless, and heartbroken.**\n\nI've been in therapy for 4.5 years. It took me an incredibly long time to get comfortable and open up, trust, start talking about difficult things. It's been an incredibly long road. Gradually we built a really good relationship and over the last few years began to feel incredibly safe, understood, cared for. I've been able to open up about so many things.\n\nOne of the things that took me a long time was trusting that she wouldn't just stop working with me because I wasn't making progress fast enough, or because she thought I wasn't trying hard enough. I would literally have nightmares about this happening. But she never did, and she had an enormous amount of patience for me. I have quite big attachment issues so they've come up often but we've worked through them, and they're useful material.\n\nOne thing that has come up very frequently is not wanting to leave at the end of sessions. Usually I just say 'I wish I could stay here' and she says 'I know', and it's okay. Sometimes it's harder and there are tears and I ask her to let me stay (always knowing she'll say no). Last week it was the hardest ending we've ever had and it was incredibly painful and I said something I really shouldn't have. When we discussed it in the following session, it was incredibly hard and I cried a lot. She said \"I sometimes worry whether this is doing you more harm than good\". We talked about how painful the relationship can be, how I wish that she loved me, how much grief I have about not feeling loved. She says it's not about not being able to handle me, but about whether the relationship has become too painful and whether it's worth exploring other options. She's made it clear that it's up to me to decide, and she's not going to make me leave.\n\nI feel confused and unsure and so deeply sad. I really thought therapy could work for me and I've committed so much and tried so much, and what if it was all for nothing? I feel like if she can't help me no-one can and I'll never feel better.\n\nI wanted to end therapy with her because I felt better, but what if we don't get to have a good ending, after all of this? What if our story is just sad? What if I tried my best to make things change, and she tried her best to help me make things change, and in the end it is all just sad and disappointing and none of it mattered?\n\nI'm really struggling at the moment. I can't stop crying thinking about it. I feel like I've failed therapy. I feel like I've let myself down, let her down. I feel like it's the end of the road and I'll never be okay. I feel like I'm too much, too damaged, too broken, can't be helped, can't be fixed.\n\nI'm scared to be honest about all of this and how much it's affecting me, because I don't want her to take it as more evidence that the relationship is hurting me. Plus we're on a 3 week break for the holidays making everything even harder. I've been crying so much for the last few days.\n\nPart of me feels angry with her as well, because she's the one who got me to trust her, and maybe my mistrust was right all along.",

A lot of my therapy revolves around my current and past romantic relationships as this is where I’ve had issues. I’m early twenties F, my therapist is (maybe?) late twenties M. \n\nIn the first few sessions, discussion of sex did come up, as I’ve had some bad experiences and a weird relationship with it. It was always a somewhat difficult topic to discuss for me but I do think it was beneficial. However, in the past couple months, there’s been a few times I’ve brought up things around sex that I would kind of like to talk about further, like issues with sex in my current relationship, but my therapist will always latch on to something else in the conversation and not talk about sex at all. \n\nMy question is whether it’s likely he’s doing this because a) he doesn’t think it’s helpful for me to discuss, b) he might be uncomfortable talking about it or thinks I am c) something else? \n\nWould love to hear your thoughts. Maybe any ideas for whether I should try harder to discuss it or leave it be? I really like this therapist and feel super good about how I’ve been improving mentally so would love to make it work.

    "title": "Should I return to this therapist ",
    "selftext": "I recently started therapy for the first time, and I’m struggling to process how I feel about the experience. The therapist is the one I knew from high school, where she worked as a therapist for students. Since I had a good relationship with her back then, and because mental health awareness is still a taboo where I live—making it difficult to find therapists—I thought she might be a good fit. My mom drove me to her home for the session, as it’s quite far.\n\nFrom the start, the experience felt very different from what I expected. She spoke to me with my mom being in the same room too. Instead of beginning by asking how I was feeling or why I had sought therapy, the focus immediately shifted to my studies. She told me my current approach wouldn’t help me get into a good college and suggested I needed to work harder. While I believe she meant well, her words hit hard. I’m not struggling because I’m lazy—it’s because I’ve been battling intense depression and grief after losing my beloved pet. Every day feels like an emotional battle, leaving me drained.\n\nI had hoped she would ask about what I was going through before offering advice, but her approach felt dismissive, almost as if she was overlooking the pain that brought me to her in the first place.\n\nEventually, my mom brought up the loss of my pet and how it has affected me. That was my breaking point—I started crying. There was so much I wanted to share, so many feelings to process, but all I could express was my biggest regret and guilt I feel about not being able to give my pet a proper headstone. My parents chose her burial site, but for various reasons, placing a headstone there isn’t possible. Her grave remains unmarked, and it pains me deeply.\n\nI also shared my fear of leaving for college. What if, by the time I return, her grave is no longer there? What if something gets built over it? My new bedroom, still under construction, faces her grave. The thought of looking out and seeing an empty lot or construction breaks my heart.\n\nWhen I shared this, the therapist said she understood the pain of losing a pet and mentioned the loss of her cat years ago. She then brought up her husband’s death during COVID, sharing how she never got to say goodbye and doesn’t even know where he’s buried. She told me my pet was “lucky in comparison.” While I empathized with her pain and gained some perspective(felt a bit better) her words didn’t ease the helplessness I feel. My pet’s grave is so close, yet I can do nothing for her.\n\nThe therapist suggested lighting a candle at the grave for three consecutive days to ease my guilt. My mom reminded her we had already done this on the tenth day after her passing, following our cultural traditions. The therapist said it wasn’t necessary then but suggested I do it for myself. Before we left, she emphasized that lighting the candles would “resolve this,” as if grief could be so easily healed.\n\nI also shared the story of how adopting my pet was unexpected and how grateful I was for that surprise. Her response was, “She came to your home because her passing was meant to happen there.” I had always thought of it as destiny bringing us together, but her perspective felt unnecessarily negative.\n\nLater, she said grieving for a month or two was okay, but anything beyond that could turn into a disorder, especially if I still cry when I hear about my pet (which I had just done moments before). She advised me to try to stop dwelling on the loss and focus on my studies and future. She also mentioned she doesn’t believe in antidepressants or anti-anxiety medication, insisting that I “fight through this” on my own. Even when I mentioned my debilitating anxiety, her advice was to “stop the thoughts” and take deep breaths. She also says she doesn’t want me to take meds for my OCD(I have been suffering since I was a kid and it has pretty much destroyed my life)\n\nDuring a break, while I was in the washroom, she told my mom, “If she had a life like mine, she would have probably died.” I understand she has endured unimaginable pain, but this comment left me feeling as though my grief and depression were trivial—as if I was overreacting.\n\nI didn’t get the chance to talk about everything I’ve been experiencing, like the depersonalization/ dissociation I’ve been struggling with, or to fully explain the depth of my depression and grief. I am having passive suicidal feelings which I don't feel like talking about since I feel as if she would judge me for that. It felt like she was quick to offer solutions without truly understanding me.\n\nHer approach left me feeling invalidated. She said I need to fight or I might “fall into” depression and anxiety—but I’m already there. That’s why I sought help in the first place.\n\nI’m conflicted about whether her approach was appropriate. Am I overthinking this? Was her advice helpful, or was it dismissive? I don’t feel like going back to her, but I also don’t know if I’m making the right decision.\n\n",

    "selftext": "I want to preface this by saying I have OCD and anxiety related disorders. This might be a bit long and complicated, but it’s been on my mind for a long time now and I don’t know where and how to communicate this. Many years ago I use to see a therapist who was very welcoming and supportive. At the time that I was seeing her I was making some poor decisions and was told by her that I shouldn’t do those particular things. One of the poor decisions that I made at the time involved a friend inviting me to go with him to one of those massage parlors that were basically brothels here in nyc. Even though I ended up going with my friend I didn’t have sex and only received a massage. \n\nAfterwards I shared this with my therapist and she stated that I shouldn’t keep going to places like that. That it’s not right or safe for me to visit those places. I listened to her and stopped going to those places. Eventually I had to get a new therapist because the one I just mentioned about was leaving the practice. With this new therapist I discussed many new things and seemed happy with the care that I was receiving from her. Eventually, the feeling of shame and guilt that accompanied me visiting a place like that came out and I shared with her how I was feeling. Her view point at the time that I shared this with her was very different from what I was expecting. She believed that there was nothing wrong with me having gone to one of those places and even went on to share with me that she had personal friends that worked in those places. \n\nThis is where things took a turn for the worst. In the midst of me hearing this I ended up hanging out with my friend again. One thing lead to another and I was again invited to one of those brothels. And stupidly enough I went. But this time I had sex with one of the sex workers. It turned out to be one of the most uncomfortable sexual experiences I’ve ever had in my life. I felt like I was taking advantage of someone. I felt like complete and utter shit afterwards. When my next appointment with my therapist came up she seemed to want to dismiss the negative feelings I had surrounding the situation. I remember afterwards stating to her that I felt bad for visiting places like that because of the kind of men that go to those places. They’re depicted in media as being violent and aggressive with these women when they go to these places. She stated to me at the time that the more I kept comparing myself to those kind of men the more I’m going to feel guilty myself about visiting those places. I believed her like an idiot.\n\nA lot of time had passed and I would say in total I visited those particular places 5 times. Towards the end of my therapy with her I found myself constantly bringing up my own shame regarding me visiting those places. The last time I did so she seemed to be a bit confused by me bringing it up. Almost like she was thinking “I thought we already discussed this you don’t need to feel guilty about visiting this places”. Or at least that was my assumption based off of her tone of voice. Eventually she left too and I quickly got another therapist. \n\nThe fact that I went to those places was still gnawing at my conscious. So I shared with him the situation. He went on to state “that lady probably wished she was some where else”. The horrible part about it is that he’s probably right. His response was completely different from that of my previous therapist. \n\nAfter some time had passed the events of the situation kept on playing and playing in my head almost in an obsessional way. And I had a mental breakdown. I started looking things up online and started seeing that a lot of the time those women are sex trafficked. Many people I saw online even went on to say that the kind of men that go to those places are rapists and you can’t buy consent. I’ve been suicidal for a long time over these events. Almost a whole year. I think about suicide everyday when I think about how much of a monster people would see me as if I shared with them my biggest fears revolving these situations. \n\nIt got so bad that I even went out of my way to search up my previous therapist on google. I saw that she was still giving therapy online. A part of me wants to reach out to her to discuss with her how I’m feeling. I want to understand why she made me think this behavior was harmless. It wasn’t harmless. I know at the end of the day I made the decision to go to those places. But I can’t help but wonder if things would be different today if I had never met her. \n\nI don’t know how to proceed with all of this. I don’t know if this is the right place to put this. If people are upset I understand. I’m upset too. \n\n ",

Anyway, I'm reading and thinking a lot about how to meet the four areas of Theraplay in our relationship (Structure, Engagement, Nurture, Challenge). And in the book I have, it talks about how parenting is. It's kind of not even \"how it should be\", it talks as though most parents try to do well in this. And I already knew my parents didn't do a good job, but wow, they literally did none of this stuff. I don't mean not doing theraplay activities, I mean they didn't care how I was feeling or make any attempt to make me feel better. They generally preferred to actively make me feel worse. It's kind of been heart-breaking to read. There is talk about co-regulation and being there with your child and helping them learn how to manage emotions.

She has validated everything for over two years now, made me feel so safe.

She doesn't have to direct me in grounding or anything else, I just slowly understand it's ok, it's safe to express, it's manageable, we'll get there. And by the end of the session, or even ten minutes in, I always always feel better. It's like magic. I'm grateful for how she helps me, and how she's modelling something I've never seen so I can help my kids. ",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone! So me (25F) have been in therapy with my current T for 7+ plus years. She’s great we have a great bond, i have friends who are also in therapy and they don’t seem to connect in the same way we do, I figured it was simply because of how long I have been with her vs them. I do have some feelings for her which I told her about, and she handled it very professional and normal. She does do things at times that some may consider a “red flag” she said to me before “oh you’re my favoriteeeeeee client” I thought that was quite odd considering if a client is dealing with transference issues why would you want to make it worse by saying that? She does not like my boyfriend, hasn’t actually expressed it but it’s incredibly obvious. I said something about him one day and she said “ I know it’s unprofessional but break up with him” when I gave birth to my son, she asked me if I needed anything I said no we got overloaded and she basically told me to bad and to think of something. So she bought me a bunch of stuff for him which was sweet! Some stuff for me as well at a different time. I am bisexual  and at times when I’d bring up other women I was involved with or one who wanted to be involved with me at the moment she’d give me that classic jealous look. I’ve been involved with more women then men I am highly aware of the jealous stare, and she would seem to get a bit irritated. My boyfriend has even accused me of having sex with her because of the gifts, flirty conversations and what not. We also have talked outside of session for no apparent reason, I saw her once outside of the office as well, she was on sick leave or something along those lines as she had some sort of surgery any who, my car was being worked on so I was walking around alone and she pulled up next to me and said heyyyyy I miss you! We talked for like 10ish minutes or so, she offered a ride I declined because well I had nowhere to be technically, she seemed sad and annoyed that I didn’t accept, but we parted ways after. Not even sure if rides are allowed or not to be honest! I’ve seen things similar to this where therapists had said “oh classic grooming behavior” or something of the sort I don’t feel like I’m being manipulated or groomed. Maybe I’m over thinking? Opinions please? I know this is long but much love to you all❤️",

Sometimes my current one's name comes to me, but I sometimes have to look it up.\n\nNot even recent sessions I can recall. I can't remember much of my life anyway, but I figured I'd remember one session of therapy to try and compare; I don't. And I do recall my current therapist has reccomended I take notes during sessions, but I have a hard time remembering to do these things usually. I typically can only recall previous therapy things IN therapy, but I don't even remember what I said, just that I discussed it at least a few times.\n\nI'm not sure what to do, because I think I'm mad at her? But I only remember a few things she's said these past few months, and it sometimes feels like an internal argument of wanting to ghost her or not. I don't want to ghost her, so I want to try and write down things to discuss in session to work on to prevent me from ghosting, but I genuinely don't always remember things. Something to write down to discuss will sometimes come to me at the worst times (i.e. middle of working, etc) where I can't pause and write it down, but it's fleeting. I'm unsure how to even approach this because I do remember trying to discuss my memory a little and I'm guessing it didn't get anywhere, because I'm still uncomfortable and upset without fully remembering why.\n\nI think maybe asking her to remind me to take notes is a start? I'm just now realising this is an issue. And it feels like I dont know her well, but to my surprise I realized I've been going weekly for a few months. It doesn't feel like it.

She has assured me she’s not uncomfortable, she has supervision and her own therapy to deal with potential discomfort.\n\nA few weeks back, I told her that sometimes I just picture her sitting in a chair in whatever room I’m in, reading a book. I felt so uncomfortable telling her this and she was all “this is the work!” and “that’s you co-regulating with me” and explaining why it’s totally okay even if it sounds weird to someone else.\n\nHonestly, it felt good to make her proud, even though it was uncomfortable. So I kind of want to tell her about something else I do, but I’m not sure if A) it will freak her out or get the same reaction and B) I don’t know why I’d tell her other than so I can get that feeling of making her proud…\n\nSo here’s the thing: I use ChatGPT to write quick short stories of us in session to help me regulate, or as a low stakes way to practice a conversation with her. I’ve used to write stories about her interacting with a younger version of me.

She asked if I wanted to ask her that? I said \"no I'm fine, yes, well no, actually yes\". Lol. So I asked her and she said that I am not too much, I'm not a burden and that she absolutely does not need a break from me. She said that she looks forward to our sessions whether they are light sessions or intense sessions. Then she asked me what I need from her right now. After talking around the issue I blurted out \"Ineed to see you every week\" and she said that she was proud of me and she'll work on the schedule to get me on a weekly schedule. \n\n\nThe second issue was having and ending a friendship with a former therapist. My current therapist was appalled that this happened and that I felt pressured to accept this friendship even though, in my gut, I knew it was wrong. She told me that this was a clear ethical violation and it NEVER should have happened. She told me that she was sorry that this therapist crossed that boundary and blurred those lines. She said it was a gross violation and a form of abuse (a different, less obvious, type of abuse but still abuse). I told her that I felt I was doing something wrong the whole time because I knew that I shouldn't be friends with a former therapist and it never felt right. She assured me that I did nothing wrong. It was entirely on this therapist because she knew it was wrong but asked for this friendship anyway.\n\nMy therapist really cleared up an incredibly complicated and confusing situation for me. She said she was so proud of me for ending this friendship and setting that boundary for myself.\n\nShe also assured me that she has those boundaries in place and that she would never cross them so I'm safe with her. She would never pursue a personal friendship with me or any client. She told me I'm safe several times which helped tremendously because the friendship with my former therapist made me feel very emotionally unsafe.\n\nThanks you ALL so so much for the support and the replies and helping me gain the confidence I needed to be so open and honest with my therapist.",

    "selftext": "Hi ya'll! So I have been struggling with a lot of shit in the last couple of months. Recently, my therapist asked about how my faith life has been since he hasn't heard me mention it. I went into detail about how I felt like working at a church as really hindered me from growing in my relationship with Jesus. I told him I would like to pick that back up, but also needed a bit of time to figure out what that is going to look like going forward as I am a different person now than I was 5 years ago. My therapist asked if I would be okay with him giving me a couple of referrals for some events coming up, and I said sure. \n\nSince then, he has invited me to a worship night, where he wasn't in attendance but his friend was. I gave the okay for him to give this friend of his my number, but they text me every so often to ask how I am doing. I have not met them in person.\n\nMy therapist invited me to an event his church is having this weekend. I am starting to feel uncomfortable with all the invites (4 in total). I've been seeing my therapist since 2021 and I've been making great progress. I know what he's doing is technically a violation of ethics, but I also don't want to report him to the board. I'd rather terminate if needed.\n\nWhat do you all suggest?",

We were texting   to check in with each other and have casual chat a few times a week. Previously he wouldn't text me unless it was about scheduling. He started to tell me more things about his life like his interests and family dynamics and such things. My feelings for him deepend in that time and I've been having fantasies about him.\n\n So today I had a session and it was super emotionally charged. I was crying and so was he and we hugged. This is the first time we had physical contact and it felt so good. Then we kissed. Afterwards he was apologetic and said he shouldn't have acted on his feelings but got caught up in the moment. I admitted I enjoyed it and had been wanting it. He said he could lose his job and I promised him I wouldn't get him in trouble. I left his office and I've been feeling confused.

    "selftext": "Hi everyone. \nI am (F25) currently in therapy for some childhood trauma. I have been to several therapists throughout the years and have recently found a new one (M50+) where I’ve been having sessions since late October. It takes some time for me to open up and I have really felt that this therapist is someone I can open up to and be incredibly vulnerable with. Flash forward two weeks ago I receive a notification that he has sent me a friend request on Facebook. And I noticed a few weeks before that after our first session he messaged me on messenger and thanked me for our session like this “Hi X, thank you for today😌”. I have not replied to that message as I don’t want to initiate contact through a social media app. He does also text me through my phone number but that is more in terms of setting up the dates for our sessions and nothing else. I find his use of emojis inappropriate though as he also always likes my replies with a heart as in he ‘hearts’ the messages. To add some more information, I signed a waiver to be “chosen” to be a client of his through Facebook. I don’t know how to feel about this as it has made me feel incredibly uneasy because I can’t comprehend the need to add me as a friend on Facebook because I’m sharing intimate parts about my personal life and family and I’m not paying him to have a direct view of that through my posts. I went today for a session and was too afraid to address the unease I felt because of the friend request. I could feel myself being uncomfortable in the room and I felt like it was weird that he didn’t address the friend request himself. I am literally in therapy because of difficulties setting boundaries so the whole thing has made me even more afraid to do so in terms of him and his actions.\n\nAm I overthinking it or? I think I need some advice and how to probably set a boundary and address that I found it weird. \n\nThank you in advance!  ",

Amd another advice or suggestion she has given is to try boxing ( since i have inner/supressed anger) . Third which i understand not advice but ahe wanted us to try to lock the chatbox bc it kinda made me anxious, but in my eyes it really wasn't the thing that made me anxious, i mean it was a part of it . The thing that triggered me was her not booking my session and not responding or anything about the session ( which obviously made me feel abandoned amd unimportant and stuff) , obviously I texted her and explained, she let it open but reminded me of tbe boundaries and to try not to write too much so it eont be overwhelming for both of us ( and I understood and respected what she said) \n\nI mean she really is trying her best, and she really wants to help me , i think honestly whats making everything worse for both of us , is that i have trouble talking ( we have talked about it once why its hard ) i want her to bring it up again, but i think thats on me to bring it up right? Idk like i want her ro try dig deeper? But im tbe one who has to bring it up right? ( forgive me please no downvote, shes my 2nd therapist, and i didn't really get much help with my 1st( i stayed a year with her)) so im not sure how its supposed to go really. With this current one its been 3 months ( note i took a break 21 days bc midterms ik ikk , and some other times there were holidays or things that prevented sessions so some times id go 10-14 days in between sessions i think maybe its just 2 times idk , and ive had 11 sessions excluding the ones coming this Sunday) \n\nI also felt really understood but not much anymore, ik tbis is on my part bc i barely talked, but my therapist has said that i have important and i am talking more and she's able to understand me more. And that shes proud of me ( it genuinely felt good to hear it , to finally be acknowledged) im prob sure she saud it bc she knows that i just want someone to notice and to acknowledge me . But still it felt good \n\nAnd she has said 2 things that didn't feel good with me i tried processing them on my own , but alas i couldn't so im going to talk to her. And i hope this makes her understand me more .\n\nAnyway please any insights or advice on any of this would be deeply appreciated 💗. Like i am going to talk to her this Sunday about last point i wrote , but anything is appreciated please 💗. \n\n\nTL;DR: My therapist had me promise not to self-harm, but I broke it. She later suggested practical steps like cutting my nails (which actually helped) and trying boxing for my suppressed anger. She also proposed locking the chatbox to reduce my anxiety, but the real issue was her delayed responses about sessions, which left me feeling unimportant. After I explained, she kept the chatbox open but set boundaries about writing less, which I respected.\n\nI’ve struggled to open up in sessions, which makes me feel less understood, though she’s acknowledged my efforts in talking more and said she’s proud of me. It felt good to be noticed. I plan to bring up two things she said that didn’t sit right with me in our next session.\n\nIs it normal for therapists to give advice (like cutting nails/boxing)? Are there any red flags in this dynamic or things I should watch for in the future? Any advice on improving communication would mean a lot!",

    "title": "Need advice! What are your thoughts on a person who is concluding their time in group therapy and wants to extend a gesture to another member hoping to continue contact outside of group?",
    "selftext": "Hey guys,\n\nI could really use some outside perspectives and advice on how I should proceed with this quandary I have.\n\n***TL;DR:*** Is it appropriate for me to give a thank-you note (w/ or w/o my contact info) to a member of my group therapy when I leave for good?\n\nFor some context, I've been part of a weekly group therapy meeting for over three years now, but I've recently decided to depart from the group. After reflecting and deliberating about this with my therapist and the group, I feel confident this is the right decision for me to make, with no hard feelings.\n\nThroughout my time in group, I have built connections with some amazing people. Among these connections, one person has always stood out to me. Time and time again, through the many ups and downs of life that we both experienced during our time together in group, I've found myself thinking about this person often. I've deeply connected with them on multiple levels. We've shared mutual support and understanding and I genuinely value the bond we've formed. It's so easy to talk to them, and I really look forward to it each week. I feel a stronger connection with them than anyone else, and they have expressed similar feelings towards me in group before too.\n\nNow, I'd be lying if I said I didn't also feel some romantic feelings towards them because of this but it's worth mentioning that despite this and the connection we have had, I have always respected the group's rules and guidelines, ensuring I am considerate of every member's privacy and honoring their trust in me. I have also made it a priority to maintain thoughtful, meaningful, and supportive interactions with everyone in the group.\n\nAs I prepare to leave, I am feeling conflicted about walking away without at least expressing my appreciation for this person's impact on my life in a personal way I'd feel more comfortable doing outside of group. While I've gotten used to the, albeit very unusual dynamic of saying goodbye forever to other members who I have also connected with, this time is different for me and I can't help but to feel like I would really regret if I didn't say anything to them. You don't meet people like this very often in life. To me, if I could at least take this opportunity to write a thank you note expressing my feelings of gratitude and acknowledging how much their presence has meant to me, that feels like a reasonable and worthwhile kind of gesture to make.\n\nIt is of the utmost importance to me not to disrupt the integrity of the group or this member's progress in therapy so this is where I am running into some dilemmas as I am unsure of any precedents to follow in this case. Ideally, I'd like to propose that we keep in touch moving forward and would frame the note to focus mainly on my appreciation of them, with no pressure or expectation, while leaving the option to continue talking open at the end. (I would do this privately after group when we're all leaving btw)\n\nI want to be conscientious to any conflicting perspectives or advice that may be against my desires, so either way, if you have been in a similar situation or just have some thoughts about this, I'd really appreciate your input! Thank you!\n\nEdits: Grammar",

    "title": "Can people contact the board to give more info regarding someone else’s complaint against a therapist? ",
    "selftext": "Okay so hopefully I can explain this so it makes sense. I'm going to give this as a hypothetical situation:\n\nSally used to work for a therapist named Linda. Linda has a client named Bob that she ended up being intimate with. Somehow Sally found out about this shortly before she stopped working for Linda. \nMonths later, while drunk, Sally lets this slip to her neighbor Frank. Frank then hears from someone else the same rumor and decides to file a complaint about Linda having sexual relations with a client. \nThe board decides to look into this claim and sends a message to Linda inquiring about the relationship between her and Bob. Linda tells Bob (as they are still actively involved). Frank tells Sally as well (both about the initial complaint and that the board is looking further into it). \n\nNow I would assume in addition to Linda needing to respond to the board regarding the allegation, that if there was some other pertinent information (regardless of if it directly answers the question/inquiry), she could mention it to the board. But here are my questions regarding who else can provide information to the board about this complaint while it's still open:\nIf Frank remembers or uncovers more pertinent information, can he contact the board regarding it? \nCould Sally contact the board about this specific complaint if she wanted to add anything? Would she get in trouble for violating HIPAA (assuming Frank didn't say how he got the initial information and Linda has no proof the information regarding a client came from Sally)? \nCould Bob contact the board about this specific complaint? How would Bob go about doing that if Bob didn't want Linda to know? \nIf the person who reported it did know and report to the board the name of the client and who told him, would the board reach out to both of them automatically, never, or only in certain circumstances? \nWhat about once the board closes the investigation, can anyone (specifically those involved in either that or something similar - like if another client had an intimate relationship with Linda too) contact the board to request they reopen the case with new information they can provide? \n\nAlso if you only have the answer to one or a couple question(s), feel free to only answer that one. I am hoping I'll be able to get answers to all of them. (And I tried to google it but was unable to find answers.)\nSimilarly, if something doesn't make sense and/or needs more clarification, please let me know. ",

    "title": "In our final session, therapist said an observation that really rattled me",
    "selftext": "This happened over 7 months ago but it still weighs on my mind.\n\nBackground: I went to therapy seeking help with depression & social anxiety. In general I'd say I have quite a sensitive temperament, am a chronic overthinker, keep to myself, and I resort to social isolation whenever I start getting overwhelmed.\n\nAfter about a dozen sessions, at the beginning of the last one I requested that it be our final. I felt quite anxious throughout therapy and struggled to answer any remotely difficult question without freezing up.\n\nFor the most part the session was fine. In the final moments, I was recounting a conversation with my doctor where I told them how I haven't found antidepressants to provide me with any benefit. I shared how my doctor actually chastised me a little for sharing this opinion (as published science says otherwise), and I felt it was a tad dismissive to my personal experience. At that point my therapist interjected, and asked if they could be honest with me. I gave them the go-ahead, and they brought up how when I speak, I do so without a filter (i.e. without tact), and that I was probably that way with my doctor leading to the aforementioned chastising. And that they've felt I had spoken to them that way as well at times during our sessions.\n\nThis honestly shocked me, and I went quiet in an attempt to compose myself, but my body language gave it away. I didn't even know what to say because my brain went into thinking overdrive, wondering what exactly to say with the added knowledge that I lack a filter and thus must speak carefully. \n\nMy therapist noticed this and asked what I was feeling. The most I could muster to say was that this was the first I'd heard someone make this observation about me, and I was just trying to take it all in. \n\nI couldn't say much after that point. They went on to say how they have a very strong suspicion that I'm neurodivergent, that is, possibly autistic or ADHD. All I could think when I heard that was that I am the most socially inept person ever. I was mostly silent for the remaining minutes. \n\nMy therapist picked up on this and asked if I was okay, but at that point the hour was up. They expressed concern for my wellbeing but I thought I should just release us both from what felt like a mutually awkward environment so I said I would like to leave and did just that.\n\nEver since that session, I can't stop thinking about how socially inept I must be for a therapist to think I don't have a filter. I was considering how therapy is an environment where things should be open and honest, and so if this is their opinion thought of me, I must really be a social failure, just truly horrible to talk to.\n\nIt was hard to accept. I asked family members if they thought the same and they said no, but surely they're biased, and my therapist had a point here?\n\nI have tried reflecting about how I speak to others. I thought I was generally a polite person but now I'm so in my head I get nervous and often stammer when talking to others. At work I take the stairs instead of the elevators out of fear I would share the elevator with someone, making small talk, and end up sayimg something rude or stupid. I'm more terrified of social interactions than I've ever been.\n\nThe last 10 or so minutes of this session have truly rattled me and it's all I can think about now. I feel like it's completely overshadowed any of the previous productive sessions and unfortunately this is all I can remember when I think about my therapy experience. \n\nAny ideas how I can work past this and convert it into self improvement rather than just a painful memory?",

    "selftext": "I suppose I'm posting this because I'm overwhelmed with emotion without an outlet I feel comfortable with. You come across stories all the time on this sub about wrongful termination or therapists failing their clients, but this isn't that. My therapist had to terminate with me about a year into care due to personal reasons. It wasn't super sudden and she informed me enough time before the end that this is where it was heading, but it didn't make it hurt any less. We spoke a lot about the loss I was feeling, how to cope with it and what it means. I didn't understand why I felt so strongly about someone who I know nothing about. Therapy was always the one place I let myself be vulnerable; I always kept myself in a layered shell around people I'm close to in life and breaking out of that was one of my goals. Our final session felt oddly anticlimactic, like one of those sessions where not much is going on and you kind of just do a little housekeeping. Part of that was my fault, I don't think I came in very prepared. I said my thanks, my goodbyes and she told me how proud she was of my progress and appreciation and that was it. I was happy with how it ended, happy with how it went, but it didn't really hit me until she was out of sight that it was over. This past year, I've been gathering my thoughts, reflecting and speaking to what was essentially a version of her in my head. It was a way to prepare myself for what I needed to say and hold myself accountable if I chickened out. In a way, she pushed aside the hateful overthinking cynic in my head and replaced them with someone who gave me a newfound hope for the future. I found myself thinking about what to say for the next session, what I'd like to say to her, what I forgot to mention, telling her how much it all meant to me. But there was no next session. I felt good enough to continue on without therapy for the time being, but part of me knows I just didn't want to see another face in that chair. My attachment to her was healthy, it was professional, but it also meant the world to me and I hope that she knows that even though I won't be able to tell her anymore.",

Fast forward to my next scheduled session.

If that makes sense… \n\nIt feels really difficult to talk about this, and other topics, because of my dissociation. I’ve gotten better at noticing the dissociative feeling when it’s starting and communicating that I want to stop or change topics, but what do I do about the suicidal thoughts? \n\nFirst it was a vague idea of wanting to be dead, then a sort of acceptance, execution, date and time, activity I’d do before the actual attempt, last meal, last walk, etc… I’ve started to think that not much matters since I’ll be dead anyways. The only thing missing is the intention and it’s kind of scaring me that that’s all that’s left. \n\nI’ve been putting off telling my therapist and psychiatrist because dissociation is embarrassing and scary for me, but now that the thoughts are getting more detailed I don’t know. I don’t know how to not dissociate considering how bad it was back when I didn’t even have any sort of plan or execution. \n\nI’m confident I won’t follow through. I have one, very strong, reason to live. I have a pet cat and I don’t plan on abandoning him. My therapist and psychiatrist know that he’s my reason to live. \n\nI just don’t know how to navigate this or what to do. I’m scared to email or call since I feel like I don’t absolutely have to. I also want to make sure that I tell them that I don’t have intention, but I don’t know. I know I shouldn’t keep it to myself because that’s how it got very bad last time. I’m just not sure what to do about it. \n\nFear of dissociation is the main reason. I trust my therapist and psychiatrist to not immediately lock me up as long as I state no intention… \n",

    "selftext": "I have cptsd from a range of childhood events. I initially started see my psychologist to deal with one particular moment and had no intention of going into other stuff.\n\nIn my last session though ( our 6th session) she was questioning me about what prompted me to seek therapy 15 years ago when I was about 18 to try and work out my history a little more to make connections. This led me to blurting out that when I was 12 yrs old an older person in authority in my life who was 21 crossed some pretty big boundaries with me. I wasn't upset retelling the parts of my story...i would occasionally pause and go quiet and fidget with my stress ball but would continue. I even laughed at one point. She mirrored my response at times and would smile if I laughed and seemed pretty chill about what I was telling her...almost casual...but she was writing down notes quite intensely. I know it's not funny and it's definitely traumatic for me...but I dunno...I kinda just laughed at one point. Is this a normal response for someone who has experienced something like  this?\n\nMainly though - I couldn't read this reaction from her. Do you think she took it seriously? She didn't question me deeply about it. Allowed me to tell her what I wanted in that time and then we did some breath work to help me regulate and I left. That's it. \n\nIs this a normal response from a therapist after you just drop something like this quite unexpected? Or does she think that because I didnt show any of the traditional signs of distress that she isnt going to worry too much about it? Or does she need time to process what I told her so she's armed for more in-depth discussion next session? \n\nShe's a trauma trained psychologist. \n\nI just need a bit of predictability and wanted to know that it's a normal reaction from a therapist after a session like this...",

    "selftext": "My therapist of a couple of months just gave me an ultimatum (that may not be an entirely fair choice of word, but that’s what it feels like). She told me, basically, that I need to either work harder to get better, or quit therapy with her. I need to decide whether I really want to change or not; she says (accurately) that I keep changing my mind.\n\nI (21, btw) was recently diagnosed with bipolar 2 (by her and then a psychiatrist, though I had some suspicions before). She also gave me a differential dx of social anxiety and AvPD, apparently mostly due to her opinion on the validity of personality disorders in general (which I, as a layperson, think is partially fair, though also I totally meet the criteria for AvPD…). Previously, since childhood, I had been diagnosed with, and variously medicated for, major depression and anxiety, as well as some related issues.\n\nThe main issue we’ve been dealing with has been my social problems, namely avoidance. We’ve been using mostly ACT, since I felt unable to deal with all the “rules”/requirements of DBT. Probably I should have agreed to that, idk. Anyway, she told me today that I am not getting anywhere in therapy (probably true), and that she perceives that I don’t actually want to get better (i.e. form new relationships). I guess this is true; I am terrified and, moreover, incompetent to do so. I don’t think my therapist’s view of me is entirely wrong. I *desperately* want relationships, but I have no idea how to have them, and I am still too scared to try. I am inclined to stay how I am, miserable but, at least, familiar with the way things are. She wants me to ignore or work past my anxiety and put myself out there. I know I *should*, but I just… can’t. I feel like I’m drowning but unable to make myself swim.\n\nMy question isn’t really about how I should respond to my therapist (quit or not, though I’m also conflicted on that); it’s more… is there any hope for me? Not necessarily now, but ever. If there is, who and how? I sometimes like to think a more psychodynamic perspective might help me (I am obsessed with my own brain, and there’s some serious weirdness in there), but I’m also pretty sure I’m projecting onto that category what I *wish* were the case. Right now I don’t feel that I can improve, have a social life, as long as I am still basically myself. I think it’s more reasonable to try to learn to be okay with loneliness. But I am also dissatisfied with this solution? I don’t know. \n\nIt seems that I am a bad patient because I can’t do the work. Is the problem entirely (not just “mostly”) with me? Is there any kind of therapy/therapist that will meet me where I am, which is pathetic and kinda lazy and very scared, or is this something I have to deal with alone?",

    "selftext": "He said this in response to me discussing some fairly mild abusive behaviour from my sister. His reaction to it was really exaggerated. That’s when he made the comment about “wielding” white privilege. He went on to claim that as a “white, male, allegedly middle class” he “obviously” can’t relate to abuse and family dysfunction,\nI messaged him after the session to ask for clarification of what he’s talking about. Here is his response.\nFor context — I’ve only been seeing him a few weeks. I’m a woman of colour and come from a family that’s both socio-economically privileged and abusive.\nHere’s his message. Would appreciate your thoughts. Something about it his comments doesn’t quite sit right with me.\n“Thank you for your message, I also thought about that part of the session. I think my reactions was mixed between a sense of not wanting to put my own experiences on any situation but also one of safeguarding as there was a lot in the session, so it probably didn't come across as well I would of hoped - I apologise for that.\nI think my mentioning my background was to do with my expectations around how I would be treated by authority, such as by the police. My 'normal' or my 'frame of reference' is always different to my clients and vocalising that, I think helps brings out a way of checking my own assumptions.\nWithout sounding like a cliche, my clients come from a very varied upbringings and wealth point of view, but I do really appreciate that you brought it up, the more honest we can be within the therapeutic relationship, the better. There is always biases and part of my job is to try and identify them within myself and adapt as much as possible, sometimes I am not as successful as I want to be.\nIf I am honest, did I assume things about your background? I probably did, but I always try and wait until I have more information - even from yesterday I got lots of new information about your background and was a little confused, but ideally I try to wait until I get more before it affects my questions.”",

    "selftext": "I was recently seeking telehealth therapy, and the therapist I was going to see uses SimplePractice. However, once I actually read the terms of service, I became pretty alarmed at the language. It seems that the company is able to process and collect a large amount of user data including potentially information shared during telehealth calls. The agreement reads: \"Except as otherwise agreed with Your Provider, SimplePractice retains the right to collect, store, process, maintain, upload, sync, transmit, share, disclose and otherwise use User Data . . . This may include, but is not limited to, profile data, health information, video, image and sound data, and personal or financial information collected from a credit card, debit card or other payment method.\"\n\nThis makes me feel very leery to agree to these terms of service since I was hoping I would have privacy and confidentiality when pursuing therapy. To be honest, I've wanted to get therapy for many years now, but I've been so concerned about privacy; I'm really probably paranoid about the issue. I would prefer to see someone in person, but I live in a place where there just aren't a lot of options nearby. Does this language mean what I think it does? It seems like even your calls are or could be stored or collected in some way. How private are telehealth video calls in general and these telehealth platforms in particular? I'm hoping someone could bring me some more clarity on this issue. Also, would there be any other option to pursue therapy that would better guarantee my privacy?  \n",

    "selftext": "My therapist is really wonderful, for starters. I have a severe trauma history and we've been doing EMDR for over a year working through a lot of different memories. Right before starting therapy, I started SHing again, after years of being clean. Since then I've done it on and off during my time in therapy. I've gone up to about 3 months without. Recently I've been engaging in it pretty regularly, 1 to 3 times a week. I also recently just came out of a period where I was extremely suicidal, a first for us during my time in therapy with him. What I've noticed over the last several weeks is his demeanor is different. His facial expressions and tone is less patient. He sounds frustrated, maybe a little cold. I agree part of the problem is that growing up in a childhood like mine makes me very sensitive to the slightest change in people. I also understand it's not my job to manage his emotions. I just don't think me noticing and pointing out things I notice is doing that? I think it's a valid thing to notice in any relationship if someone is treating you in a way that affects you. I don't agree with him pretending like his frustration doesn't exist. It makes me not want to talk about it and leaves me feeling gaslit. Definitely curious what other people think. Am I trying to manage him? What I'm looking for from him is, isn't my interpretation of what's happening important also, whether he is meaning to come across as frustrated or not?",

    "selftext": "**Edit**: Since I can't bring myself to respond to everyone, I'd like to say thank you here. I appreciate all the kindness you all have shown me despite my being a stranger. It's hard to convey how much it truly helped me process the immediate first wave of shock. It has been immensely difficult to cope with this, but I will be alright even if I am not right now. Day by day through tears. If anyone stumbles across this post because they're going through the same thing, I am sorry, but at least we have [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwoLACv_srQ) about our situation to cry to.\n\nLast week, I was told that my therapist called in sick and couldn’t go through with any of his appointments that week. This was fine by me, and nothing of concern. It happens. Today, I woke up from a dream in which he was still sick and called me into his office to look out the window with him which, in my dream, was about ten times the size than normal and overlooked a beautiful garden. Then I checked my inbox to find an email from the office urging me to call as soon as possible to discuss my next appointment.\n\nSo I call. And the second that this woman starts speaking, I know what happened before she says it. It’s in her voice, the way it’s shaking, it’s tiny tremors and cracks as she asks if I’m able to talk about something difficult. I’ve had this call before, but not as a patient. She tells me he “passed away” out of nowhere, unexpectedly, and that the whole office and his family are completely shocked, mourning him  My stomach churns. My mind races. It wasn’t possible he suddenly died of a physical illness—he was young, lean, and active. It couldn’t have been some freak accident—I would have heard about it.\n\nHe had disclosed past struggles with depression many times before, as we were very comfortable being candid with one another, but of course, you never assume the worst outcome. You never think that someone is going to die just a few years after meeting them. You never think the person who tells you that you deserve to live will kill himself. Trying my best to not break out into violent sobs, I asked her if she could disclose whether or not it was intentional. She paused for about ten seconds, sniffling throughout the otherwise silent moment. She stuttered, rapidly muttering uh and um before, ultimately, saying she said she couldn’t. But we both knew, and then came more silence until she whispered that she was so sorry.\n\nHe hadn’t even gotten to turn 30 yet. This man, 29 years old, had already helped me, a woman of 25, infinitely more than any other therapist I had seen throughout my life. I have extensive trauma that often makes me terrified of men, and yet I trusted him with my life. I was hellbent on staying with him. I have spent hours sobbing in absolute grief, thinking of his family, thinking of how much I truly appreciated him and all of the ways in which he helped me. It is because of this man’s helping hands that I have been able to feel capable of the growth I have accomplished. And now he is gone. And here I am confronting this sudden, violent lack. And now I sit wondering what I’m ever supposed to do after this.\n\nThe idea of seeking another therapist feels so vulgar, borderline blasphemous, given the dynamic I had developed with him. I think in any significant social relationship, people develop a type of language of their own, accumulating phrases, gestures, and word games all rife with signifiers which allow them to communicate in a way that wasn’t possible before. This can be a radically life-affirming way of bridging the distance of subjectivity. To lose a friend, for example, can feel like losing an entire world, because within that friendship really did exist something akin to a world. And, well, to lose a therapist feels like losing an extra sense that helped you see through the dark.\n\nI don’t know what I’m “allowed” to feel. I am grieving him in the way I would grieve a friend, a loved one, even while recognizing the nature of the relationship. I have always been cautious about potentially unconsciously perceiving therapists as anything but. I recognize that the therapist-client relationship is, ultimately, transactional, that he and I were still cut-off from each other’s respective lives as we lived them, that the room with a velvet couch is, functionally, phenomenologically separate from everyday life. At the same time, despite the fact that I will never know him in the way that family and friends knew him, there was still a unique connection that I unwaveringly cherished and held close to my heart.\n\nWhen people I know have died by suicide, I have grieved with friends who also knew and loved them like I did. Who am I to talk to about this? Well, I know who, but he’s gone.\n\nGod, why? My heart hurts. I am so sorry for his family, friends, and all who knew him, including clients. But mostly I am sorry for him. I am so so sorry for him.\n\nNo longer will I be able to tell this man, trusted above all, about my progressing thanks to his perspective, seeing his face light up with joy and awe. No longer will I step into his office and watch him turn off the lights like he knows I prefer. No longer will he email me a song he thinks I’ll like. no longer will we spend the last twenty minutes of a meandering session joking around about philosophy. No longer will we sit in the middle of the floor together laughing at his handwriting as he makes a note about flowers for me to take home. No longer will I keep a note on my phone every week of things to tell him. No longer will I feel like I can absolve myself of shame simply by treating his office like a makeshift confessional booth. No longer will I hear his laugh. No longer will I feel dread wash away just from a few comforting words by him. No longer will I feel like at least one person will always understand me without failure.\n\nI am sorry for the long, rambling post (I can imagine my therapist exclaiming at me to not say sorry for that). I hope that literally anyone on earth has any insight whatsoever on this. I don’t know what to do.",

    "selftext": "\n\n\nOn Friday I ended up having a mental breakdown and sent him a long (and embarrassing) message telling him how hurt I was. He bumped up our appointment so we could talk. So we’ve had two sessions since then, one Monday and one today. They both went well.\n\nAs for the first incident when I heard him say “she’s so..”. I did ask him what he said. He said that he mentioned me having sensory difficulties due to being autistic, and was asking a coworker if a smell in the office was too overwhelming/if he needed to move spaces to not bother me. So I’m assuming he said “she’s sensitive” and not “she’s so” whatever. He told me he wasn’t even able to think of anything he would shit talk about and wouldn’t talk about me that way. So that was just a misunderstanding.\n\nAs for the second incident where he said he didn’t want to see me, he did admit to saying that and apologized. He said that he was personally triggered by our rupture and that it was entirely to do with how he was feeling and had nothing to do with him actually not wanting to see me. He accepted full responsibility for hurting me and said that it was his fault and I didn’t do anything wrong.\n\nThe past two sessions were good. We talked over everything. He was extremely apologetic and I’ve decided to forgive him, so I’ll still continue to see him for the time being. I’m still feeling a little insecure but we’ve come up with strategies to help me feel more secure in the therapeutic relationship. He says if we can repair the ruptures we’ve had then the relationship will be stronger and more healing.\n\n\nSo a bit of an anticlimactic update, but everything went okay and we’re going to try and make it work. Thank you guys for all the support when I was in a low place 💛",

    "title": "My therapist of 16 years has been a no-show for three weeks, and last night I found out he died.",
    "selftext": "My therapist was 83 years old, and I (50 F) knew he wouldn’t be here forever, but we had weekly telephone appointments, and he always sounded quite well. When he missed the first one, I assumed he was away, and either he forgot to tell me, or I forgot he told me. I was 99% sure it wasn’t that I forgot though, because I always said “next week, same time same place?” and he would always laugh and say yes. When he didn’t phone me for the second one, I was concerned, but I knew he had close family and if something happened, they were there for him. I did try his number and got his normal voicemail, but I didn’t leave a message. I assumed something had happened, and I was keeping an eye on the obituaries. I was bummed out thinking about him being seriously ill or dying, but I felt okay-ish. Then last night I was sitting on the deck watching the birds over the marsh, and an Osprey came out of the treetops on the other side and flew three or four slow, beautiful circles over the water and disappeared back into the forest. It made me think of him, because he would always chuckle at the way I get excited about birds, and Ospreys are not common where I live. I looked again for an obituary, and my stomach dropped when I found one. I wasn’t prepared for it. When I read it, I had such a mixture of feelings. I didn’t know much about him at all, but he lived an incredible life, and the obituary mentioned what a loving, kind and sensitive person he was, which I never thought about, but in retrospect is accurate. I felt so grateful to him, for his gentleness and kindness with me over the years. I’ve grown and changed so much through working with him, and I felt very lucky to have found a therapist that was a good fit for me. Then grief hit me, realizing that I’ll never get his perspective again, never wonder if I’m off-base, or being wretched, or unfair, and ask him what he thinks. The obituary also kind of stirred up some abandonment issues, I think, because it mentioned that he had been given a terminal diagnosis over a year ago, and (ridiculously) I think a part of me is trying to process that he didn’t say goodbye. Common sense tells me that dying is something that happens without our permission or input, but I’m just… struggling.\n\nEdited to add that it’s been 8 days since I posted this, and it was the best thing I could have done. I really needed and appreciated the support and suggestions everyone offered here, and while I couldn’t bring myself to write anything more for a while, I am so grateful for everyone here. ",

    "title": "Update: I feel disgusted by what my crush on my therapist made me do",
    "selftext": "Ok so I made a post last week talking about how I have a crush on my therapist (or the fancy word “transference”) and last week I decided to try to pursue him and came to our session wearing provocative clothing and extra make up. Nothing unprofessional happened at the session, but I felt extremely embarrassed and ashamed afterwards and almost cancelled our next session and almost told him we couldn’t afford him anymore so I wouldn’t have to see him again. However, thank you to the absolutely wonderful people on this sub who were so encouraging and kind and supportive who convinced me not to.\n\nThis morning I went to my session wearing jeans and a zip up hoodie with the hood pulled up and was just staring at the floor. He noticed I seemed less confident and energetic than usual, and asked if anything was wrong and I told him I was embarrassed about something I was scared to talk about. Then after some long and awkward pauses was finally able to tell him why I was wearing what I was and what my intentions were (basically “I find you very very handsome and was hoping I’d get your attention and we could spend our session having sex”). I had to imply some things because I was just so mortified but he was very nonjudgmental about it.\n\nHe said he did notice I was acting a little out of character but he was proud of me that I was able to tell him that, and he admired me for doing so since it probably took a lot of courage. He then told me transference is very normal so he was not at all offended or felt disrespected by my behavior. In fact he told me he appreciated the compliment of me saying i thought he was handsome. I felt a lot better after that and we were able to move on and I talked to him about some stuff going on at work just fine.\n\nSo yeah. It all worked out. He didn’t call me names like I was (irrationally) scared of and we were able to move on. One big thank you to everyone who commented on my last post and helped me find the courage to talk to him. I appreciate you all so so much and this sub is very special.",

    "selftext": "I've mentioned on this sub that both my parents are therapists. And they're good ones, my dudes. they really are. If any of you are their clients, you're lucky (and also, that's really weird to think about...) But I've been living with them for a little over a month now, and I have become the self-appointed client advocate in their lives. They *need* one.\n\n**Content Warning:** For all of you who have not come to terms with the fact that your therapists are real people in the real world, this post isn't for you.\n\nThe following are real conversations I have had with these fully-licensed, experienced therapist-people I'm related to. You're welcome.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Why You Can't Judge a Therapist by Their Facial Expressions**\n\nDad: Seeya tonight, hon!\n\nMe: Dad, your teeth.\n\n*(My dad has a partial with two fake front teeth because of an accident involving a kayak and our garage and a dog leash. Don't ask.)*\n\nDad: Oh yeah! Thanks!\n\nMe: You need to keep a set in your office, Dad. You CANNOT forget those.\n\nDad: Sometimes I forget.\n\nMe: And what do you do?!\n\nDad: I just don't smile for the whole session.\n\nMe: DAD. You cannot do that to people. You're going to give your clients a complex. If Mister T didn't smile at me for a whole session I'd contemplate why he suddenly hated my guts for, like, 36 hours at least.\n\nDad: Well, most of my clients don't treat therapy like an improv comedy show like you and Mister T.\n\nMe: STILL.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nMe: Um... mom? Did something... happen... to your face?\n\nMom: Oh yeah! I got stung by a bee! Is it noticeable?\n\nMe: Uh... yeeeees.\n\nMom: Well, it's telehealth, so I doubt it will bother anyone.\n\nMe: You kinda look like you're winking, though. Us clients, we read into that stuff, mom.\n\nMom: Not everyone is like you, Selfless.\n\nMe: MOM. I'm an anxious person! People hire you because they are also anxious people! Your clients *are* like me!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Switching Back to In-Person is Weird for Them, Too**\n\nDad: First day back with clients in the office!\n\nMom: Remember, don't hug any women.\n\nDad: I have not done that for like... 15 years!\n\nMe: Dad... when people come in-person, they can see your pants.\n\nDad: I know...\n\nMe: Can... *you...* see your pants right now?\n\nMom: You painted in those yesterday! You can't wear those!\n\nDad: Shit! I'm already late!\n\nMe: Change your pants, dad.\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**They Don't Always Tell You Everything (But You Knew That)**\n\n*(Noticed that my mom pauses and sighs every time she reaches the bottom of our staircase.)*\n\nMe: Rough journey from the second floor again?\n\nMom: No... I'm just thinking about one of my clients. She's so depressed, and the stairs from her apartment seem so endless and daunting so she doesn't leave much. Every time I go down our stairs, I think about her, and I think, \"I did it. You can do it, too. I know it.\"\n\nMe: That's really sweet, mom. You should tell her.\n\nMom: *(Takes out her phone, and emails her client.)* Good idea. I just did.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*(My dad makes homemade wooden toys. He's really into slingshots lately.)*\n\nDad: Look, Selfless! This one is for my co-worker, and this one is for \\[your son\\], and... man. I wish I could give this one to a client of mine. He'd love it.\n\nMe: Well, you know it's probably not a good idea to hand out weaponry to your clients. But you should tell him you thought about how he'd like it.\n\nDad: Do you think I could send it to him anonymously?\n\nMe: I *hope* you're kidding.\n\nDad: I... am...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Edited to add:\n\nHe just got home.\n\nMe: Dad, how was in-person?\n\nDad: *(Stops dead in his tracks, swivels around to face me)* It. Was. So. Weird.\n\nMe: Right?! SO WEIRD.\n\nDad: THE WEIRDEST.\n\nMe: I KNOW.\n\nDad: We were just... THERE.\n\nMe: Like, ALL THE WAY.\n\nDad: I KNOW.\n\nMe: It gets better after a few sessions.\n\nDad: Good.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo. Hello from the other side. My parents are wacky. Therapists are human. Sometimes, it's actually helpful to see behind the curtain. So here's my patient perspective on a therapist's perspective on psychotherapy! (Probably not a common enough experience for its own sub, eh?) Happy Monday!",

Every time she would ask if there was anything that I wanted to talk about, I could never seem to muster up the courage to bring it up, and would just continue to suffer in silence.\n\n This past week I could feel my emotions coming to a head, and I was close to having a breakdown. However, I held it together and made it to my session. About 5 minutes in, my T asked if there was anything on my mind. I completely broke down and everything came spilling out; the suicidal thoughts, the severe anxiety, and how I had reached my limit. I was crying hysterically and could not not catch my breath or control myself. My T stared at me in silence for about a minute and then asked if she could sit next to me. She sat right by me, took both of my hands, and I realized she had tears in her eyes. She began to cry, and apologized for not realizing the severity of my depression and expressed sympathy for my pain. We were able to discuss a plan that would involve my doctor and psychiatrist getting involved. She assured me that she would be there to help me work through this, and I promised to be more honest with her. \n\nI have never had a session that felt more healing than this one. Experiencing such raw emotion (on both sides) and seeing that my T genuinely cares about me is a huge step in our work. I hope that this will be one of many steps. \n\nTLDR: Finally told my T about severe depression and suicidal thoughts. She cried with me, and it was a huge step in my healing",

It's what we do.** \n\nYour therapist might be kind, or a good listener, or funny, or smart, or legit attractive, or *any of the things people are.* If they went to a shit-ton of school because they really wanted to help people sort out their messed-up lives, they're probably going to be at least a few of those things. And liking someone who gives you positive attention? Yeah, that's just human nature. There is nothing. NOTHING. To feel bad about there. \n\nI get that we pay them to be in the room. Like, I know. I do it, too. We give them money because they're specially trained to be in the room really well for us. **But they're still people. And we're still people.** And when you spend a lot of time with someone, relationships happen, yo. \n\n\"But I wish my therapist was my mom and that's weird.\" Is it weird to wish you had a mom that showed up and listened to you and supported you? Nope. That sounds real normal. \n\n\"But I want to have sex with my therapist, and that's weird.\" Is it, though? It just sounds like you happen to be attracted to people, and your therapist is one of them. Hell, have you ever thought a cashier or a waiter or the landscaper at your place of employment was hot? Yeah, me too. \n\n\"But when my therapist goes on vacation I think about them and I'm sad and that's...\" Don't even say it. \n\n**Therapy relationships are relationships. Therapists are people. We're going to** ***feel*** **things, friends. And I think we could be a little kinder to ourselves about how legit and totally ok those feelings are.** \n\nWe know our therapists feel stuff, too. Whether they tell you about it or not. In our last session we were debriefing:\n\nMister T: I'm sorry I made that decision for you. I was trying to protect you, but you're not mine to protect. \n\nMe: Thanks for saying that. That was... pretty vulnerable of you.\n\nMister T: Just bein' a human. \n\nSee?

My anxiety loves to fill my head with reasons as to why someone is late and it often gets me to the thought that they could have died. This time it was actually true. I called my therapist and I got a weird and quiet answer from someone else who sort of sounded like him. He asked who I was, I told him and asked for my therapist, saying that this was his clinical phone number that was posted on his website. He told me that he was his cousin and he regretfully had to inform me that my therapist has died. I was and still am in complete disbelief. This doesn't feel real. I have had a few therapists before, but this one has been my most favourite and comforting and effective therapist. We had just begun doing EMDR session to treat my past traumas, but I've been working with him for nearly a year now. He has always made sure that I feel heard and that everything I tell him was safe with him. He always made me feel appreciated. He even made personalized audio recordings for mindfulness meditations that I could do between our sessions. He has provided me with free sessions because I am so in debt from a series of concussion injuries over the past 5 years. I love this person and their counselling has changed my life immensely in the time that we had together. I am shattered to know that he took his own life. I imagine the weight of all that he was carrying and all that he wanted to do felt like it was too much. He was on a mission to help as many people with their traumas so that they could live with less pain. He has done that for me, and I can't believe his part in my journey has come to such an abrupt and unexpected end. My heart aches and I feel broken right now. (Please know that I do feel safe though, I am so fortunate to have a supportive partner and I will seek other counseling when I feel ready). \n\nThis seems like such an uncommon event, so I turn to you all to ask if anyone can relate. Has this happened to anyone here before? If you feel like you are able, can you share some of your experience with me? What did you do after you found out? How did you cope? What helped you make it through and what didn't? Any support is so greatly appreciated.",

    "selftext": "Long but hopefully helpful/relatable. Yesterday, I had my termination session with my previous therapist of over a year. I was constantly terrified she was ready to ax me, and despite the fact that we talked about that fear, I still convinced myself to just end things and start with someone new. I mourned for weeks.\n\nTo my surprise, in our last session she actually shared that working with me was like “a breath of fresh air” and that our connection was genuine. She admitted to processing, in her own time, the heavier things I shared—that she didn’t just walk away from the emotional bombs I dropped robotically and that she really cared. It was a huge relief to know that sometimes the vulnerable things we share stick with our therapists and they do their own processing with them. Hearing that made me feel incredibly grateful and humbled to know I wasn’t as alone in dealing with the weight of those secrets. \n\nThere was only so much she could share within the treatment framework without triggering my feelings of being a burden, but in that moment I *really* needed to hear that our work mattered to her on a personal level. The thing that nearly broke me was hearing her voice soften as she said, encouragingly—and almost sadly: “Alien, not everyone in your life is going to leave you.” \n\nIt was such a loaded statement because she knew why I terminated. I understood it as her way of saying, “*I was not going to abandon you*”. \n\nIt was an overarching theme to the session. She asked me to trust that people will stick around if I will allow it. The subtext was deafening. Our relationship, as we both had anticipated, was culminating into the same defensive pattern that I had followed my whole life: ending my relationships before they could end me. \n\nIn earlier sessions she revealed hopes that this treatment might model a new and healthier path for me (I’m really sorry that it didn’t). Yet, she still found a graceful way to investigate the fear behind my decision without making me feel ashamed or judged. Thanking me for my honesty and vulnerability, she reassured me that the way this played out was *okay*. She thought I ultimately used good judgment in deciding to work with a more specialized therapist who I could learn to trust the same. \n\nShe set the bar really fucking high for all of my future therapists—my life is so much better having met her, mainly because she first validated my trauma and also fostered my very first safe space where I got to process a lot of ‘forbidden’ emotions I had never admitted to anyone before. I appreciated that she left the door open for me to drop in again, despite not offering to continue contact with other former clients. My heart is full, I have so much gratitude, and I hope that others with strong attachments to their therapists can feel safe enough to trust that not all of them are actively trying to get rid of us.",

I was telling him about something confidential, and out of nowhere I hear a woman loudly moaning. Unmistakably porn. Obviously he clicked open a pornsite browser or un-muted a porn video.\n\nI just pretended like nothing happened, which was probably a mistake, because he did it again like 5 minutes later, I heard a 'Jerkmates' ad, probably a pop-up to some porn site. I'm deeply disturbed by this. I acted as if I didn't hear anything again because I didn't want the conflict and I didn't want him to know that I knew what just happened. But it was super awkward and he ended the call shortly after.\n\nIs this considered sexual harassment? I reported the issue through their general form when you 'change therapists.' I have also e-mailed contact support twice in the past 4 days, and called their 888 hotline, but I have NOT yet received a response from the BetterHelp team.\n\nThat's why I've turned to Reddit for help. What do I do now? Is there no recourse for sexual misconduct on the BetterHelp platform? Do they not care that their therapists are watching porn during videocalls?\n\nI'm going to ask for a full refund for those sessions, and probably stop using the app. Is this the least that I can do? - or are there legal ramifications for this incident? Misdemeanor or felony charges?\n\nClearly a therapist like this should not be able to continue to work.\n\nAbout me: I have a bachelor's in Psychology. A bachelor's in Communication Studies. An associate's in History. I'm currently applying to a master's program in Clinical Mental Health Counseling and thinking of becoming a therapist myself.\n\nI'm not sure how this experience is going to shape how I feel about becoming a therapist one day.",

    "selftext": "I made a post two days ago talking about how my sister asked me to sit in on her therapy session so she could tell me how she was feeling about me working so much. I already felt really bad about it so I felt the only thing it accomplished was making me feel worse, like a piece of shit older brother and guardian. However, after digesting the situation and what she said, and interacting with some of the lovely people in the comments section of my last post, I made a little decision.\n\nWhen I got home from work, I went into my sister’s room with a slip of paper from work and said my managers gave me something and I’m not quite sure what to make of it and asked if she could look at it for me and maybe she could tell me. She seemed a little confused and went “…okay” and looked at it for a moment then realized it was an approved request (signed by my supervisor + union representative) for a 7 day vacation the week before school starts back up for her at the end of the month.\n\nShe gasped out loud and excitedly did a jump hug on me and I told her she had the playbook for the whole thing and we could go into the city every day or just sit at home if it was what she wanted. Then she started crying and well, not even gonna lie I started crying a bit.\n\nIn the end, I’m really happy we had that session. It’s really good to know she still values time with me and (seemingly) isn’t angry with me for how much I’ve been working and in hindsight, I’m touched she cared about our relationship enough to communicate that to me.\n\nSo yeah, I have the best baby sister in the world and ya boys giving her a vacation to plan 😎\n\n(ps, something I lied to her about…the vacation I’m taking is unscheduled time off since I didn’t have enough saved up for the whole week. I told her I’m gonna be on paid vacation leave for the week so she wouldn’t stress about a week I wasn’t working, but hey, sometimes a white lie is ok :) )",

    "title": "My psychologist ghosted me to teach me a lesson.",
    "selftext": "I had seen this psychologist 11 times over the course of about 8 months in 2019/2020. He was consistently late to every session (both in-person and virtual) but always prompt about ending the session on time which bugged me but, since it was just a matter of a few minutes, I tolerated it.\n\nOur last session was a virtual one in September 2020. I logged in five minutes before the start time and waited. After I had been waiting for 17 minutes (at which point he was 12 minutes late) I got fed up and decided I was sick of his tardiness, so I closed the browser and no-showed. To be clear, I still paid for this session even though I did not attend it. \n\nFast forward to two weeks ago. I've been really struggling and having a hard time finding another doctor, so I decided to give him another shot. I made an appointment (he has switched back to in-person sessions) and texted him the day before to confirm.\n\nThe next morning, I showed up but his office was locked and the lights were off. I called him, no answer. I texted, no response. Nothing. I instantly had a feeling like I had been ghosted, but constant feelings of abandonment are common with my condition so I tried to put that thought out of my mind. I tried to remind myself that he's a professional, that it makes no sense for a *psychologist* of all people would resort to that kind of petty tit-for-tat...and decided instead to assume he was dealing with a personal emergency and would get back to me when he could. \n\nFast forward again to yesterday. It had been 16 days since the scheduled appointment and I'd not heard anything from him until he called me and \\~very kindly\\~ left a voicemail saying he would be happy to start fresh if I had learned to respect other people's time, and if that was the case then I was welcome to book another appointment with him. \n\nI mean. I just. Wow.\n\nOn the one hand, he's got a point, I shouldn't have no-showed and I had even been planning to apologize and explain my reasoning during the session *he* no-showed for. On the other hand, it wasn't exactly a waste of his time - he was conducting virtual sessions from his home. It's not like he got up, got dressed, and drove to the office only to be stood up - *as I had.* And he was still paid for the session just the same as if I had shown up. Forgive me for saying it, but our no-shows were not the same. \n\nSo I declined the offer. I'm not interested in seeing a psychologist who engages in exactly the kind of retaliatory behavior that I'm trying to fix in myself. \n\nI don't really know where I'm going with this post. But has anyone else experienced something like this?",

    "selftext": "Am I wrong in thinking this message from my therapist is inappropriate? Was my response reasonable?\n\nWas I wrong to feel this message from my therapist is inappropriate? Was my response reasonable?\n\nSome background; I have been seeing her for almost four years. I went through a messy divorce and a pretty toxic relationship after and acknowledge that she helped me a great deal. \n\nRecently however, I’ve been doing much better mentally, started a new healthy romantic relationship, have worked on some communication issues I had, and also resolved some issues with my best friend. I have also had an increase in obligations for work and church and in my personal life. She also changed her hours and so I had to go from a weekly appointment at a set time and day to making an appointment every week that would vary in time and day each week, along with FaceTime as my only option (she wasn’t doing in person sessions in the evening). I also felt that I was basically going to just review my week every week rather than actually being challenged or working on anything related to my mental health. I also mentioned in passing that I was discerning a call to the diaconate/priesthood with my church; I never asked for her advice on that process, just discussed it as something that was happening.  I had tried broaching the subject of reducing my therapy several times and she basically ignored me and redirected the session to something else. \n\nSo, after doing some thinking I sent a message last night that I was considering stopping therapy because of the above reasons. She messaged me a very curt message and said that I had until 8am to let her know if I was coming to my session this week (this was sent at 11:30pm last night). I wanted to take some time to think about it and then got very busy at work today (I’m a nurse) and wasn’t able to give this the attention I wanted to, so I did not message her back. The message I included came at 4pm.  I was shocked and took a bit to respond but sent the response I included (minus identifying information).\n\nI am genuinely curious to know if anyone has experienced anything like this with a therapist. Or if there is a perspective in either her message that I’m not seeing.  I felt that my response was reasonable, but is it? \n\nI am “emotionally and psychologically” mature enough to know that I certainly benefited from her expertise and from therapy and can separate this experience from my overall positive experience of therapy, should I chose to resume therapy with another therapist.  \n\nThanks!",

    "selftext": "EDIT: I’m putting this right at the top so people who haven’t read this can see the edit first. I have been told that my post comes off as insensitive and one sided. Obviously not my intention. This sub should be a safe space to discuss ALL things about Therapy/therapists. If you have doubts about your therapist please share them. Don’t ignore your gut. It is important. This is not intended to shame anyone, or discourage anyone from talking about their feelings here. It was merely to remind people that we are ultimately responsible for our own healing and therapists are professionals that help us do that, but it can also be important to recognize that they are people with feelings as well, and they are not perfect. Sometimes we can get caught up in our own stuff and forget that - which happens with people who’ve experienced various degrees of trauma/unhealthy attachments and that’s OKAY. I am just saying that we should remember that therapists are humans who have boundaries and it is perfectly normal for them to set boundaries with their clients for many reasons and I have seen many people in this sub seem to push things that seem like basic client/therapist boundaries (though everyone has different boundaries with their own T’s)\n\nI have no clue how this is going to be received in this sub and I hope this is allowed… I want to start by saying I am not a therapist. I’ve been in therapy on and off since I was about 13 and I am now 28. I have been seeing my therapist for a few years now and we have a good relationship, but I’ve seen lots of therapists that I either did not like at all and were horrible, or just didn’t feel like I was making any progress with.\n \nI feel like almost every day I’m seeing posts on this sub about how people think their therapists don’t care about them when they take too long to respond or forget something they said, that they’re not responding to texts outside of sessions, and I even saw one where someone was upset and jealous that their therapist had other clients.\n \nI understand that we see therapists because we need help, and some of these things mentioned above could be manifestations of attachment issues, trauma etc… and I am not discounting that at all. I am ALSO not shaming anyone asking for help on whether or not their therapist did something wrong, or getting (hopefully) un-biased opinions from this sub. That’s what it’s for!\n \nBut I just feel like I’ve seen a lot of stuff on this sub lately complaining that their therapists aren’t at their sole beck and call immediately when they think they need them...\n \nYour therapist is a person, just like you. They’re human beings with friends, families, problems, and lives outside of their jobs as therapists. They have other clients – that doesn’t mean they don’t care about you. They have multiple people they are trying to help through trauma/issues. That would be difficult and draining! Don’t you think?\n \nAs someone with CPTSD I find my own problems exhausting, I can’t imagine having to help multiple people work through various problems as my job and also deal with my own issues. Which is another reason why I think *most* of these people are wonderful. They chose a difficult career because they want to help people. I think as people on the other side of therapy we forget that because we are so consumed with our problems we forget that our therapists are people.\n \nThere have been times that my therapist has forgotten something I’ve told her. I forget things people tell me sometimes too. Because I’m a human.\n \nThere have been times that my therapist has not gotten back to my email or text immediately. I leave texts and emails unanswered sometimes too, even when I mean to answer them. Because I’m a human.\n \nThere have been times that my therapist has said something I didn’t like. I’m positive I say things people don’t like. All. The. Time. Because I’m a human. (That’s why communicating this with them is important but that’s another topic).\n \nI just feel like I needed to say this here. Therapists can really suck, if you have a bad one, but just because your therapist isn’t perfect doesn’t mean you should look for a new one, or give up on therapy, because they’re just people. They want to help, and they try to help as many people as they’re capable of while also having their own lives.\n \nI ALSO want to clarify – this is not a “your problems aren’t bad enough” post and is not meant to shame ANYONE. I just think that as human beings we owe it to other human beings to recognize that we are ALL humans and none of us are perfect. There is a standard we need to hold our therapists to as therapists yes, but I think there are a lot of unrealistic standards that some folks hold their therapists to as PEOPLE.\n \nIt is healthy for us to recognize that they are other people and not just a tool for us to improve our own lives, and I think that it could be helpful to try and remember that the next time your therapist does something that is off-putting to you (that doesn’t violate any codes of conduct obviously).",

    "selftext": "in case people missed it we moved my session up to yesterday thank god.\n\nok so first things first thanks to everyone who commented on my last post. It was really helpful to read through everything and get different opinions on stuff :)\n\nI had therapy and talked to the guy (who's name I'm not gonna say,) and both of them went better than I was expecting. I guess i'll start with my session...idk how many details you guys are interested in so it might get kinda long sorry. So it was a little awkward, but she was super nice about everything and said she kind of panicked too, and that her and her coworkers could have never imagined something like this happening lol. We talked about like how I felt about seeing her outside of her office (more specifically the fact that I was accidentally at her house) and what that like \"brought up\" for me, and then she told me that when she went upstairs she was talking to colleagues and reaching out to her supervisor like you all said she probably was. She told me that she didn't (and couldn't) tell her son anything about it (or about anything i've ever shared with her), so we talked through what a conversation with him might look like and how he could react and stuff. Luckily she said she thinks it's great that we're dating and she can't really do anything to stop us either way, it's just sad that it's so complicated, and we talked through how it might feel seeing her outside of therapy if I did keep dating him. So finally at the end we came up with a game plan. Whether I keep dating her son or not we both decided it would be best to transfer out, and she already had picked out one of her coworkers that she thought would be a good fit for me who works like in the same office place thing, just on different days than she's there so I don't have to see her in a \"therapeutic setting\" at all. I signed some like disclosure forms or something so she could talk to the other therapist about what we've been working on and stuff, and I thought that would be it, but I'm gonna see her one more time next week and the other therapist is going to come in so we can talk to her together cause I'm more comfortable with that, and then I'll officially start seeing the new one the week after. The good news is that as far as mental health goes my issues are pretty generic (anxiety/depression, adhd, and some self harm stuff that I've mostly worked through) so switching won't be super difficult. Like obviously it'll be an adjustment but I think i'll live probably.\n\nNow for the update about talking to her son:\nI asked him if we could meet up to talk and he said yes. So pretty much i was just like \"hey so this is really weird but your mom is/was actually my therapist and I had no idea until last weekend when you introduced me i'm so sorry and totally understand if you want to end things\" and then filled him in on more details. He obviously thought it was a little strange, but was as understanding as you could be in this situation (thank god for a therapist mom) and apparently he thought something was off because of how we both acted and how I left so fast after \"meeting\" her. We talked about what to do and he said it's a little weird, but it doesn't bother him enough that he'd want to break up as long as i'm still comfortable with it, which I am for now at least. The thing we decided though is that at least for a while we're gonna sort of avoid his house and just hang out at mine and like around other places until i get settled in with the new therapist so that it'll hopefully be a little less weird when we do go to his house. We also agreed to talk to each other if it did end up being too much for one of us, but for right now we're both ok with everything. \n\nSo overall things went really well. I guess it  sucks that I have to switch therapists, but i'm really glad I can still date her son because I really like him and he's super nice and i'm glad I didn't have to choose between them because I had to change therapists either way. Thanks again for everyone's advice/support, and i'll keep you all updated if things change!",

I hated my T’s guts and thought they were an awful person (and Im usually an amazing judge of character). Turns out they’re not awful and I just hate people that know me...part of me somewhere deep down  must have known I was the problem here because I stuck with them despite hating them for months on end.\n2. I thought I was attention seeking and just using my depression as an excuse. Turns out I had legit issues that I just never had the capacity or ability to deal with, and no support system.\n3. I thought I was a kind and emotionally available person and everyone just didnt like me. Turns out I was a kind and emotionally unavailable person that kept everyone, including my own self, at a distance and didnt understand that my lack of connection with people was, well, because of my lack of trying to connect.\n\nAnd many more but lastly I thought I wasn’t worthy of love or care because I beat myself down so much and told myself I wasn’t worth shit so much that it became my identity. But I am (and you are) worthy of love and care. I deserve it and I should expect it from myself most of all before I ever search for it in others. I hated myself for so long that I cringe at the idea of being nice to myself or saying anything positive, and even though it felt right, it’s not. I have a long way to go for a lot of things, but even if I’m only one step further than before, it’s still progress.\n\nSo here’s to finishing sessions for 2020 and being kind to yourself even when you dont want to\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*edit\\*\n\nWow I wasnt expecting people to read this much less interact with it.

My daughter and I went back and forth with the therapist mediating, and then things started to get heated and she told me “no more bullshit” and asked if I was disappointed or embarrassed by her, and she insisted I gave a yes or no answer and no “pussyfooting” answer. I told her that if she had asked me that two weeks ago, the answer would’ve been a resounding yes. However, then I realized I have a healthy and beautiful daughter who lives with me and talks to me, and she’s found love and is working close to what she loves (art) so now that I’m seeing her from the correct angle. I don’t know what there isn’t to be proud of. I then told her I’m not proud of the jackass I was two weeks ago and I hoped she could forgive me. She stopped for a moment and then started crying and I hugged her and she hugged me back. She and I went out for lunch afterwards and it was pretty nice.\n\nIt doesn’t matter how old she gets, whenever I see her crying I *always* see my little girl crying.

I just had my final session with a client of mine and I thought it would be helpful to know that it’s difficult for us too. It brings up goodbyes with past clients as well. You trust us enough to share your innermost fears and vulnerabilities, something that any decent therapist does not take lightly. That’s not easy to do, especially to someone who you know little about personally. I can only speak for myself, but I’m guessing most therapists would agree that we care about you just as much as you care about us.

    "selftext": "In essence, my thesis is exactly the title - we should not, whenever Covid slithers off into the beyond, accept teletherapy as the new normal. And by “we”, I mean clients, and potential clients, of therapy - and, let’s face it, everyone is a potential client of therapy.\n\nIn my opinion, teletherapy is a much reduced service from a client perspective. It is no substitute for the healing and feeling of safety that can be present when the therapist and client are physically in the same room. It is devoid of the level of healing energy that can come from two people physically occupying the same space.\n\nThis is not to say that therapists have not done trojan work at a time of huge uncertainty in facilitating teletherapy, nor is it to say that there is no effort involved in providing therapy over a virtual platform. Nor is it even to say that teletherapy cannot help and have positive outcomes. But it is not a good normal. I see so many posts on this subreddit from clients of various forms of teletherapy who seem to be struggling with issues with their therapist that would present as far less problematic and much easier to resolve in face to face therapy. And then, I read so many posts on the Pyschotherapy subreddit where therapists speak of their decision to never return to face to face -  virtual overheads are cheaper, it’s more flexible etc... As clients, we need to ensure we understand that our time, potential for change and money are valuable (and sometimes finite) resources. We should not, in a post Covid world, accept a reduced service as the normal.\n\nI feel very lucky that I was seeing my therapist for a number of years prior to Covid, we both feel that teletherapy is no substitute for in-person. We are happy that we can continue our sessions in this manner until we can safely resume in-person sessions, but neither of us believe what we are doing to be ideal. Post-Covid, there is definitely a space for teletherapy as a tool, but in a toolbox that hangs off the primacy of the physical therapy room. Teletherapy could be used occasionally as various needs arise amongst clients and therapists (or for specific cohorts of clients for whom face to face is not an option) but not as the main event.\n\nAs clients of therapy we need to be very careful that a temporary solution does not become the normal.\n\n\\*\\*\\* Edit: some really great replies, from all perspectives, here. It’s an area that deserves a lot of thought, and much discussion. \\*\\*\\*",

    "title": "Therapy Is Weird: The Milestones of the First Year",
    "selftext": "Happy First Therapyversary To Meeeee!\n\nIt's been quite a year, my friends. For all of us. And as I approach a year of therapy (today!), I can't help but reflect on what a weird-ass trip it's been. Now, I know everyone's therapy experience is different. Like, *vastly* different. But I also know that there are those out there who have been through, or are in the midst of, that rollercoaster of a first year, and can relate to some of this. So. Indulge me, people. It's a long one, but it's kinda fun.\n\ntl;dr: Therapy Is Weird.\n\n**THE MANY MILESTONES OF THE FIRST YEAR OF THERAPY**\n\n^((As told by an anxious, panic-prone, trauma denier))\n\n**1. The Intro, Where I Pretend To Be Mostly Normal**\n\n\"Hi, I'm Selfless! I'm a pretty average professional person who's just, you know, low-key nervous about Covid! So happy to meet you!\" I said, while sitting in a chair at a desk like a sane human. I actually think my therapist literally said, \"Yeah, we'll see.\" The nerve of that guy.\n\n**2. Oh. Shit.**\n\nMy first in-therapy panic attack came during our third session, over telehealth, as I sat in the corner of my office holding the laptop where no one could see me. It took me off guard, was humiliating, and confusing, and exhausting, and over *effing* telehealth. I was ready to not come back. The next session, I showed up and said, \"I'm really sorry about that last session.\" He said, \"What the hell do you think therapy is for? I know it was painful for you, but really, Selfless. Bring it on. You're not a burden.\" I was thinking: Just you wait, Mister T. You're going to eat those words.\n\n**3. Trying to Prove You're Worth Their Time**\n\nRemember when your therapist person listened to you talk, gave you \"unconditional positive regard,\" and you were like, nope. I don't deserve *this* kind of attention. No way. Too good to be true. This person seems smart and put together and there's no way I'm worth all this kindness. But maybe I can try to earn it by being the best. Client. Ever. *(Panic-Googles \"How to be the best therapy client ever\" and reads everything.)*\n\n**4. When You Google Your Therapist And Feel Like a Total Creep**\n\nAnd speaking of Googling... I actually thought I was the first person who did this. Which is hilarious, now. The stupid part is, the dude's internet presence is squeaky-clean. I found his Pinterest page and discovered that he likes s'mores a lot, so much there's a whole board dedicated to them (a S'morgasboard? Thank you. Thank you.) And that was about it. And I felt like a total gross stalker person. And then posted here about it, and everyone reassured me that everyone does this. Thanks, everyone.\n\n**5. \"You're going to quit on me and when you do I will surely die.\"**\n\nI didn't say it, but I thought it for weeeeeks. Months? Maybe. And when I say \"thought about it,\" I mean obsessed over it daily. He's going to die/quit/hate me/move/or never have existed in the first place, and then I will probably perish in a puddle of abandoned shame. He must have sensed this, since that's kind of his job, and said, \"I'm not going anywhere.\" And I was like \"I'll believe it when I see it, chump.\" And then...\n\n**6. First Cancellation**\n\nA few weeks later, the receptionist called me a few hours before my appointment, telling me it was canceled. And suddenly, I was the person who cries pathetically on the phone with the receptionist. She must have called Mister T and said, \"Sir, I just talked to your crazy client and she's being crazy,\" because I got a call ten minutes later: \"Heyyy, Selfless. It's your therapist. I'm sorry I had to cancel on you today. I just wanted to tell you that I'm ok, and ask if there was anything you needed to talk about.\" And that's when I became the person who cries pathetically on the phone with two people in one day.\n\n**7. The Day You Find Out Your Parents Weren't Perfect And Your Childhood Was Cray**\n\nAppointment one, I straight-up told Mister T I had an idyllic childhood. Like, that it was perfect. He gave me a very doubtful \"huh.\" And I was like, *how dare you.* And then months later, after reading two short essays I wrote about my relationships with my parents and siblings and how I processed all of my emotions in my closet, he slowly and gently, like a social-working ninja, helped me realized that my childhood was just as fucked up as everyone else's. And I was pissed. (But he was right.)\n\n**8. First Cryptic Email**\n\nI had a med adjustment half a year into therapy that ruined my eva-lovin' mind. Like, immediately. (Everyone else who has experienced this put yo hands up! It suuuucks!) It was a weekend, and I was desperate, and I sent Mister T. the first non-business email I've ever sent him, full of weirdly-worded cries for help and downplayed suicidal ideation. It was embarrassing. And I apologized ASAP. Told him I knew it was inappropriate and I only sent it to him because I was pretty sure he wouldn't read it. And he called it what it was and said, you proooobably aaaaactually sent it to me because you trust me and needed a safe place for your scary thoughts. And I was like fine, know-it-all.\n\n**9. The Day Your T Recommends A Psych Eval**\n\nIt's a terrible feeling when your therapist tells you that a different psychologist person needs to hear about all your shit so they can draw some medically-worded conclusions.\n\n**9.5. Post-Eval Anxiety Sesh**\n\nThis is the common occurrence where you have to process the fact that the psychologist who evaluated you thought you were being oppressed by demons. Oh. Wait. That doesn't happen to most people? Nm then.\n\nAlso, though, one of my tests came back invalidated because of \"possible over-reporting.\" I immediately emailed Mister T begging him not to read the results. Because what if he never trusted me again? What if he trusted \"Dr. You're-a-demon-possessed-liar, PsyD\" instead? Writing it out, it doesn't make much sense. When I showed up to our session, Mister T held up the report and said, \"I'm so fucking frustrated with this guy.\" Phew.\n\n**10. Convincing Your T You're Not Ok**\n\nThere was one session where my therapist told me he was excited to talk himself out of a job. My heart rate jumped by like 100 bpm. Ummmmm nope. You're on retainer for life, my friend. And in case you're not convinced, here's a really cool panic attack I made, just for you. See, look how messed up I still am? Please stay forever.\n\n**11. The Day You Both Figure Out Why You're So Not Ok**\n\nI'm actually not sure how common this is, but I didn't identify my own trauma as trauma for a good 8 months. I thought it was so normal that *I had not even mentioned it.* And as soon as it started coming out, we were both relieved. Kinda horrified, definitely overwhelmed, but also relieved. Because suddenly, all this anxiety and panic and stress made a whole lot more sense to both of us. Our sessions were more focused. The puzzle pieces fit. Then, we started doing therapy frrealz.\n\n**12. When The Masks Come Off. The Actual, Literal, Covid Masks (and the Other Ones)**\n\nThe first session in-person, where we took off our masks, was hella weird. Just the most awkward thing ever. It was almost too real, and too intense. I had made Mister T into some two-dimensional cartoon character, and suddenly he was an actual man with a *mouth*. (And then a goose scared me at the window. That pushed me over the edge.)\n\nBut just as Covid-masks coming off made things a realer shade of real, so did the removal of the metaphorical masks. There was the day I finally called the trauma, trauma, and called the abuse, abuse. There was the day Mister T had not slept and dropped some serious truth-bombs because he was too tired for my bullshit. There was a lot of mutual humanness, and I know there will be a lot more.\n\nBecause therapy is weird, you guys, but I'm a much \"me-er me\"\\* (\\*that's a Mister T trademark) after a year of it than I ever imagined I could be. So I encourage all of you to push through the awkward. Get to the truth. Know you're not a creep, know you're worth their time, forgive yourself for the cryptic emails and insecurities and continue onward. This is hard work, but it's worth doing.",

    "selftext": "\nI’ve been seeing my therapist for over a year now. I’ve been feeling increasingly depressed over the past few weeks and mentioned at this session how I felt I was possibly doing “worse” due to feeling the highlighted discrepancy between feeling the pain of past trauma and the pressure to “just get over what happened” he asked for clarification about “what happened?”. I replied “uhh the trafficking??” And he is like “what are you talking about you never told me that??”.  \n\nThe session just kind of fell apart after that. I was weeping and feeling disoriented and in disbelief. I expressed feeling justified in my belief that the world doesn’t care what happened to me. He was in damage control mode and offered apologies that “IF” I truly had told him then he dropped the ball..and “IF” I had truly told him then he was sorry. But he went on to state that there are two people involved in the therapeutic relationship and the causation of ruptures are from both ends. At that point I told him I needed to leave and that I was being asked to take accountability for what wasn’t mine, but was his. I told him I needed time to see if the work could even continue. I left sobbing. \n\nLater that night he emailed me to let me know what I already knew. (That he checked his notes from our initial meeting and I did in fact tell him). I replied that I already knew that and it wasn’t that he forgot something I told him a year ago, but that it’s foundational to the work that I am doing and shaped my entire way of being. I referenced multiple other sessions where I spoke about it and let him know that his failure wasn’t in forgetting something once, it was in failing to listen to me at all. \n\nYall I’m devastated. I’m 38 now, the trafficking happened from 15-17 and I’m JUST NOW beginning to be able to poke the edges of that wound. I wasted a year plus of expensive sessions in the hopes that I could restore some faith in the world and that my pain mattered to someone.  I paid him to pretend it mattered and it STILL couldn’t be done.  \n\nI’m feeling incredibly isolated, like more damage has been done and now I am without resources to process this. (And incredibly reluctant to ever trust the therapy process again). I’ve also switched from freeze to fawn mode and am preoccupied with worrying about if he’s mad at me, if this makes me a “bad” client, etc. What would be helpful to me is if others could chime in with whether this is as big a betrayal as it seems.  ( I’m open to the idea that I’m being hypersensitive due to the pain of the original trauma). I’d love any form of support or suggestions about how to personally heal from this.",

I have no respect for him anymore and wouldn’t be able to get through a session without thinking of how he hates many types of people and how aggressive he is to them. \n\nI’m also not sure if this warrants a complaint to his employer or if that’s taking it too far?\n\nI’d love to know your thoughts. \n\nPS I’m an Asian gay man in case that context is helpful.",

    "selftext": "I see posts romanticizing the therapeutic relationship. Maybe people doting after their therapists or with inner conflicts around flirtations.\n\nI went down that road and this post is to tell you that everything you google is true. I was love bombed and sucked into a terrible relationship. I was pregnant with a child by the time I wanted to leave. He would taunt me that there were no records. He would joke that no one else would believe it. A relationship so verbally and emotionally abusive it’s broken my life. \n\nThere is an innate power imbalance and they will use it against you, over and over in ways you don’t understand at first. I insisted to my friends and family that it was fine, how dare they be upset at an age gap. \nWhat I could never explain to them was that he treated me for wanting to take a gun to my head from my history of sexual abuse as a child. He saw me as being worthy of something I called love and I thought that finally meant I wasn’t so worthless anymore. \n\nThe romantic relationships I had while being treated by him were discouraged, put down, and ultimately ended. Then went my family. He discouraged me from speaking with them because they didn’t understand him. My friends went too, over time. \n\nIt wasn’t until there were tears streaming down my face as I begged to leave that I realized how bad it all had gotten. That he stole everything from me. My self worth. Confidence. Trust. \n\nI always knew something was wrong but didn’t want to face it. I knew this even starting was taboo but initially it seemed hot and exciting. It’s faded to its true meaning now. Cold, bitter, and desolate. Im stuck with him forever now. \n\nI’ve submitted a complaint but who knows if any board would even care at this point. The evidence is there but someone could just as easily call me out as a spiteful ex wife. Who knows what would be more painful - leaving or having no one believe me. \n\nTLDR: got into a relationship with my therapist. Abusive and manipulative just like the internet tells you. Avoid it.",

    "selftext": "Tl;dr: I contacted a therapist I hadn’t seen in almost a dozen years not expecting a reply. I got one a week later. But to be on the safe side, don’t get your hopes up.\n\nI stopped seeing a therapist 11 years ago and I don’t live in the same city anymore. Last month, I was driving my mother somewhere and we happened to be in the immediate vicinity of that therapist’s office and ex-T came across my mind. I felt all of that kindness, empathy, and care shown towards me in my “younger days” and I couldn’t let it go. I felt this visceral need to connect with her human-to-human, one more time. \n\nI googled her and emailed her last week. I went into this knowing that I could handle never getting a reply. I told her that I didn’t know if she remembered me. I was honest and told her where I got her email address and that I was aware of possibly shouting into a void. (I believe I was toughened up against not getting replies after my IOP program last year. 3 people I happened to really like gave out their email addresses when they left, I contacted them, and they never wrote back. I felt really hurt and it took a long time to get over it.)\n\nI went on to tell her my impetus for contacting her (the stuff I related above) and gave her a brief rundown of what has happened in my life since then…almost none of it good, unfortunately. I told her that I was in good hands with a therapist and a psychiatrist/med regimen. I ended with an anecdote from one of our very last sessions. I told her that I was in a gutter of depression and she paid me what I considered to be one of the highest compliments a patient can receive from their therapist - she told me I was someone she would consider to be a friend had we not met in this context. I told her that thinking about that still made me emotional, and signed off with “anyway, I’m still here.”\n\nSent. I moved on.\n\nShe wrote back 7 days later, you guys. She did remember me! She went on to tell me that she still had a piece of artwork that I had made in college, which I had completely forgotten about. (It was probably a Xmas gift or something.) She thanked me for writing, catching up, and said she was impressed with the amount of work I was doing for my overall health. \n\n“I will never forget you and our working relationship. …I was delighted to hear from you. I wish you all the best. Thanks for checking in. That meant a lot to me. Warm regards.”\n\nThat made my night. I’m proud of myself for being so vulnerable despite the possibility of being disappointed. And by the way, I realized that my parade of not-so-great things over the last 11 years was a self audit when I look back on it now, and I am trying to reframe that as a “both…and” kind of thing. Some of the events I recounted to her were completely out of my control anyway, like death. \n\nThanks to all of you T’s out there",

    "selftext": "A lot of what is said on this sub by therapists does cross lines, and termination is always a safe option. I recognize that I can’t judge what crosses somebody else’s line, also. Sometimes dumping is the only sound advice. \n\nI just notice “dump your T” messages are thrown around on *so* many posts. On a few occasions, I have posted one or two lines of something hurtful my therapist has said, looking for advice on how to address it and cope with it until the next session. However, I get several comments how I should fire them immediately. \n\nMy first thought is that T’s are hard to come by. It’s not easily accessible to find another affordable & compassionate T in your area, and it’s just not possible for everyone to sit on a 6 week waitlist when your health is so volatile. It feels as helpful as responding “move out” when one says they’re living with someone they get into an argument with. \n\nMy second thought is that we are in therapy to learn how to better function, and interpersonal effectiveness is one of the biggest skills to work on. \n\nMy therapist is a human, and a template. I’ve learned look at our disagreements, including her mistakes, as an opportunity to learn healthy confrontation and how to advocate for my needs. (I recognize not all respond well, and I’m lucky that mine does).\n\nFor example- I shared that my T spoke on her vacations, timeshare, boat etc. while my extreme financial struggles cause immense stress in my daily life. I shared on here for advice on how to explain to her how it bothers me. I received so many “leave her” comments and comments attacking her personally, with only one comment suggesting I mention it to her. I chose to speak to her on it and she immediately apologized. She eventually told me that she hadn’t realized how her brief self-disclosures after vacations might effect *all* her clients, and actually thanked me for bringing it up. \n\nI struggle with others in my life in the same way, and it showed me how to approach them about it. I learned a transferable and useful skill that helps me better function on my own. I am so glad I didn’t lose her over that, and that I had the opportunity learn more about confrontation.\n\nTherapists will say things that upset you, and even say/do things that are objectively wrong. If I terminated everytime a therapist said something wrong to me, I would never be able to find a therapist and my mental health would be deteriorated.\n\nEdit: I guess I need to reiterate again that am not against termination, and it’s not bad to fire a therapist. This is my opinion based off of my experiences and a few others I have seen in this sub. This post has nothing to do with bad therapists or therapists you do not click with. I’m suggesting that you speak to your therapist about non-dealbreaker ruptures and disagreements, and to advocate for yourself. I never suggested this was easy, either. I struggle with it a lot. It is a necessary skill for interpersonal communication, though. Because every single therapist will say something wrong at some point",

He’s also been late to several of my appointments; this Monday, he was late by 20 minutes. I’m really getting sick and tired of constantly feeling like I’m being jerked around by a so-called “professional.” He has been somewhat helpful so far, but the lack of consistency is making me doubt his commitment and respect for my time. I’ve brought this up to him before, yet the issue still persists. It’s actually gotten even worse since he switched to private practice. I plan on bringing it up again today. \n\nAm I wrong for being fed up with this? Or should I have fired this guy a long time ago?",

I also told her I don’t feel ok with the fact that I was charged for it because we got no work done and I got less than half of her time that I was promised. I was super nervous at what she said, but she thanked me for telling her all that and she admired me advocating for myself. Then she said she was very sorry if she made me feel like she didn’t value/respect my time and that she was thinking of me all week and felt terrible she made me cry, and then she said she wouldn’t bill me for that session.\n\nWe had a session that was pretty good. I feel bad because I know shit happens and she has kids and a family and didn’t get payment for this week’s session. But at least now I can feel some sense of closure for it.",

    "title": "I think my therapist took advantage of me for 4 years?",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone, I’m not even sure where to start. There’s so much to unpack, but I’ll do my best. In October of 2019, when I was 23, I decided to try therapy because I had been struggling with anxiety for a long time and finally wanted help. I’m gay and had just entered my first relationship with a woman, so I was also dealing with identity and coming out issues. I found an LGBTQ+ friendly therapist in my area—let’s call her Sam—and decided to give it a shot.\n\nAt first, everything seemed great. Sam was 31, and shared with me in the first session that she is married to a woman and part of the LGBTQ+ community, which made me feel comfortable opening up. We clicked right away, and over time, I shared more with her about my childhood trauma, including sexual abuse. Then COVID happened, and we shifted to telehealth for a while, but eventually, she suggested we return to in-person sessions because of the intense trauma work we were doing. She said I was the only client she was seeing in person, which made me feel special. We started meeting twice a week, sometimes for up to two hours, often late into the night (this continued for our whole relationship, each session went over and was usually 2 hours or so. Looking back, that was the first red flag, but I didn’t see it at the time.\n\nAs we spent more time together, things started to blur. Our relationship became closer, and she would text me between sessions—sometimes about therapy, but other times just random conversations, sending TikToks, or checking in on me late into the night. Eventually, I started developing feelings for her, which I was upfront about. She explained transference to me, and we spent a lot of time talking about my feelings for her. But I had this gut feeling that she felt something for me too. It wasn’t just the texts—it was the late-night conversations, how much she focused on my sex life, and the way she interacted with me. It almost seemed like she was abusing the transference of that even makes sense?\n\nShe crossed so many boundaries (which I didn’t realize at the time). She sat next to me on the couch during sessions when I told her it was hard for me to talk about trauma while facing her. Eventually, we were hugging after sessions, saying “I love you” to each other, and walking to our cars together. When I cried, she would hold me. She diagnosed me with BPD and told me she also had BPD, saying she “saw herself in me.” I needed a new psychiatrist since mine moved and she got me in with someone amazing who I still see. After setting me up with this psych, Sam told me this is also her psych as well!! Kind of weird no? Anyway this all made me feel so connected to her, and I developed a deep attachment. I became very dependent on her, but looking back, it felt like she encouraged it.\n\nI didn’t know it wasn’t normal. She told me I was her favorite client, called me the most attractive client she ever had, and constantly texted me outside of sessions. At the time, I didn’t realize how wrong it was because I’d never been in therapy before, and all this attention made me feel so special. I even ignored people in my life who said it was unhealthy and that she seemed obsessed with me.\n\nThings continued to escalate. Sam also started seeing my girlfriend, let’s call her Shay, as her therapist. Despite knowing my jealousy and attachment issues, she suggested this, and I agreed, not realizing it was wrong. Looking back on it, it was clear that she enjoyed the jealousy I felt and continued to blur the lines between professional and personal boundaries.\n\nOne of the most distressing parts of therapy was discussing my sexual trauma. I shared with her that sometimes when I talked or thought about it, my body would have these physical reactions, like getting aroused, and it made me feel extremely confused and ashamed. I didn’t understand why it was happening, and it was so embarrassing to admit to her. After I talked about this in session she texted me something that was deeply inappropriate. I added a screenshot of it here.\n\nEventually, I started to question what was happening a bit. While doing my internship, I confided in one of the counselors about my relationship with Sam. I showed him some of our texts, and he was horrified. He told me it was incredibly inappropriate and that I shouldn’t be seeing her anymore. I had never really let myself think about it like that, but hearing someone else confirm it opened my eyes a little.\n\nI ended up journaling about my conversation with the counselor and what he said. I shared that journal entry with Sam before one of our sessions, and she blew up at me. She threatened to cancel our appointment and texted me saying she couldn’t trust me anymore etc. When I went in to see her that night, she was furious. She made me delete all our texts and screenshots in front of her (luckily, I saved some in a private folder). By the end of the session, she was hugging me again, telling me it was okay and that she loved me. It was terrifying.\n\nI’m still processing all of this. She moved earlier this year, and we don’t talk much anymore. She had promised to come to my master’s graduation, but backed out at the last minute, which was devastating. It’s been six months now, and I’ve had a lot of time to think. I realize how inappropriate and abusive this dynamic was. At the time, I thought she was amazing and loved feeling special, but now I see how manipulated and dependent she made me feel. My friends and family have told me I should report her, but I feel so guilty. Was this all my fault? Am I overreacting? I really am looking for some support, and I’m hoping not to get blamed or told I should’ve known better etc. I know this is partially my fault too. But I’m just really confused and hurt.\n\nThere are way more to the whole story but yeah. Sorry for the long post. I’m processing so much:(\n",

If I’m being honest I’ve developed a crush on him that I really hate and I love talking to him and the brief moments he mentions his personal life and learning about him. \n\nPlease, please no judgment from here on out. Please.\n\nFor my appointment yesterday, I really really wanted him to notice me so I spent extra time on my makeup and wore a crop top and some yoga pants leggings with no underwear on under either of them so you could pretty much see the outline of my, well, bits. I guess I was hoping maybe he’d notice my body and would make a move and we’d spend the session…well, you know. Shocker to no one, it didn’t work like that and we just had a session as normal. When I first left I was disappointed but the more I thought about it the more gross I felt.

I am beyond mortified, embarrassed and ashamed that I behaved liked that and now I don’t want to go back and I’ll probably just tell my dad he doesn’t take our insurance anymore. Even worse, I’m scared maybe he knew what I was doing and feels disrespected and weirded out.\n\nSorry, just wanted to tell someone in a safe space.

Then she asked me if I wanted to talk about a topic I had broached during the previous session.  I really didn't, it was actually the most traumatic event in my life and I wasn't ready, but she was setting out her lunch and not looking at me and I was confused and embarrassed and figured that was what I was supposed to do so I started telling her about it.  Of course I immediately broke down and was distraught and sobbing as I spoke, and at the same time I could hear my therapist crunching on apple slices.  It made me really angry but in my distress and embarrassment I just kept talking.  I wish I had just stopped and told her I would rather postpone my session to another time but I just kept talking, crying, being angry and confused and embarrassed all at the same time, and all while listening to her crunch on her apples.  When I looked up now and then, I would see her stop chewing but I could see a lump in her cheek where her food was sitting while she looked at me \"sympathetically\", obviously waiting for me to look down again so she could finish chewing.  Like an idiot I kept talking.  Later, I was so angry with her and disgusted with myself for not stopping.  I felt like she was not invested in me and my trauma in the least, just \"one more story\" among many others.  I was angry at myself for telling her.  I wanted to take my story back, I felt like it was a betrayal of myself and of the suffering loved one of whom I was speaking.  I was disgusted with myself that I had told a story that had been causing me pain and guilt for 10 years, that I had never told another living sole, to a practical stranger who really didn't care at all.  I don't think I can go back to her.  I guess I was just wondering if I am overreacting.  I did after all tell her it was okay to eat her lunch, and no one was forcing me to continue talking, other than my own insecurity and confusion.  I would love people's input.  Thanks!",

All the posts stating: can I ask my T this or should I tell them that or can I ask for help with this-the answer is yes.  You do not need to feel uncomfortable in a therapy setting being curious about the person you're bearing all your inner secrets to. We know that dynamic is unnatural, we will help you work through this. \n\n**2) Most of us (myself included) have our own mental health issues and our own therapists.** \n\nJust like you are not at 100% every day, either are we. We certainly should do our best to provide the highest quality services but we also experience life stressors like lack of sleep and spilling coffee all over everything or sleeping through an alarm. Try to practice compassion if your T makes a mistake and realize that it is not personal, we are humans and we are flawed. \n\nAlso, I believe having our own mental health challenges gives us critical insight into how those we work with are struggling and allows us to relate in more impactful ways. \n\n**3)** **Community Mental Health-You are receiving services through community mental health if you are insured through medicaid and receive services through state insurance or are receiving services free of cost. Why is this important?**\n\nCommunity mental health is known for having unmanageably high case loads, poor pay, and a lack of quality support and supervision. This is also where most new therapists start their careers as we must be supervised for 2 years before practicing independently. Supervision is expensive ($50-150/hour) so working at a larger organization is often the only practical option for a new clinician.  This means there is a good chance the person you're seeing is newer, overwhelmed, and lacking support from those above them in the organization.\n\nWhile this is clearly an unfair system that primarily harms marginalized populations, it is not the fault of the therapist themselves, and we typically have just as much control over the situation as you do. This is likely why you will sometimes see therapists eating something, we literally see 6-8 people in 8 hours. This may also be why your TH seems distracted or typing at times. While I believe it's important to address this directly with people in sessions, where I presently work, we are literally required to do notes during sessions. \n\n**4) Not every therapist will be for you.** \n\nSome of the posts I have read have been extremely critical of the clinician where I could easily see where their actions were valid and appropriate. Some people's methods are outside of the box and sometimes, personalities just don't click.\n\n**5) COVID: THERAPISTS ARE EXHAUSTED. WE ARE TRYING, I SWEAR.** \n\nI have no doubt there are some truly horrible therapists out there. I've even had a couple of my own who really sucked. That being said, most of us got into this field because we want to help. We clawed our way through years of schooling with the end goal of supporting others through challenges. The past 2 years have been redefining for us. How we've been able to continue providing support when so many of us have been facing our own mental health concerns is truly remarkable. Working from home is really hard for a lot of us. The social isolation and things impacting our clients are also impacting us. We really are trying to all hang in together. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's all I can think of for now. Feel free to ask questions & I will try my best to respond. \n\nI've been considering writing this for a while, so I hope this is helpful to some of you in your therapy journey!",

    "selftext": "This is NOT to start any political discourse in the comments.\n\nI am 23f. I was hospitalized frequently as a child with bipolar disorder w/ psychotic symptoms. I have not been hospitalized or in police situations in 6 years. I speak often on trauma from hospitalizations, including police interaction. I was taken down by police, sometimes 7 or 8 of them, as a 70 pound child 10 year old. I had bruises from police restraints before the age of 15. I was once taken to jail during a break prior to being brought to an emergency room. I have had police draw guns on me during mental health episodes before I got my period. I have listened to police tell one another stigmatizing comments related to my situation. These events were horrific, and indisputably traumatizing to me. \n\nIn my personal opinion and research, police are under-trained on mental health situations and tend to escalate episodes out of a genuine lack of knowledge, for both children and adults alike. In the world of mental health, especially with children, police should only be used when there is absolutely no other option. I work hard in several coalitions to advocate for mental health reform in my daily life to prevent the situations that I have gone through. \n\nMy therapist is often swift to tell me that each police situation was for protection, to defend the action taken, and that it should not effect my views of the police. She tells me that they were there to keep me safe, defending every action taken. I do not doubt there were genuine attempts to keep me safe, however, they were not always the appropriate method. I have always been able to justify her response. I either (a) assume that she was not aware of the extent of what I had gone through and broader social contexts relating to police and mental health. or (b) assume that she was using basic cbt principles trying to make me see the possible positive side to everything. \n\nI am her final client of the day every Monday, and she is the final clinician in office. I know which car is hers, as it is the only one there when I leave. The only spot today at the start of session was right behind her. I noticed the sole thin blue line bumper sticker immediately, and it has kind of crushed me. \n\nI know how small and meaningless this should be.\n\nI know that politics should not matter in therapy. I don’t care if she is full-blown Republican, if she can help me. A good therapist won’t let this infiltrate their care. But I cant help but feel her personal political take has impacted her opinions on my own trauma.",

    "selftext": "I’ve been dealing with PTSD for 5 years and finding it nearly impossible to get adequate care. I have encountered so many self-identified “trauma therapists” who seem like they haven’t even read the DSM entry for PTSD, never mind having the first clue about treating it. I don’t know what people are learning in therapy school these days but there’s a truly astounding amount of underqualified therapists I interview who try to tell me they “understand” or “have experience treating trauma” and then go on to prove they don’t even have a basic understanding of the physiology of PTSD. \n\nGuess what- trauma isn’t a buzzword for your instagram bio. It’s something that drives people to suicide if untreated or mismanaged, and if you take the wrong approach with someone like me, you can do HARM. And I’m saying this from experience of working with therapists who have done actual harm in being inexperienced and yet playing with the fire that is PTSD.\n\nTrauma is complicated. If you have a two-year degree and have been in practice for a year or two with limited evidence-based training in the area: know your limits and check your ego and please ask yourself why you’re calling yourself something you’re not. At the end of the day, are you trying to HELP people or pat yourself on the back and collect a paycheck?\n\nStick to what you know. Be good at what you know. Get training in what you don’t know.

It felt so good to affirm my belief that he was a truly special therapist, and at the same time it hurts even more that he was in so much pain that he took his life when I know he was such an incredibly good and kind person who wanted to help everyone he could.\n\nEveryone who spoke shared about his immense kindness. It was the single reason that the professor who became his graduate supervisor decided to give him an internship even though he wasn't going to take on anyone that summer. He told us a story of when my T was on his way to the office and saw a distressed woman yelling at traffic, so he stopped to ask her if she was okay. He learned that her husband had just died and she couldn't understand how everyone was just carrying on with their lives and going to work like nothing happened. He stayed with her and supported her until help came. Then he went to the office and didn't tell anyone about it until a month later.\n\nHe went to Germany to teach English and came back speaking fluent German. He was incredibly intelligent and very dedicated to learning. He originally had a geology degree and then went back to school to get a bachelor of social work and a masters of social work so he could become a therapist and help others with their trauma. \n\nHe went to an online professional training session with his hedgehog in a pouch around his neck. He loved to help friends in need and he would always drive anyone to the airport of they needed. He even had a fight over driving friends to the airport with a friend he went to school with, and then he later apologized to her say that he realized it meant a lot to her and he wanted to let her drive people there too.\n\nI spoke with his cousin who answered my T's phone when I called because he was late for our session. I got to thank him in person for staying on the phone with me while I processed the news and for sending me information about the memorial and referrals. He thanked me in return. It turns out I was the first person he had to tell over my T's phone and I was somehow helpful to him too.\n\nI thanked his mom for raising such a kind person and told her the immense impact he has had on my life. I think that was one of the hardest parts.\n\nOne of his friends and also a T thanked me for coming and spoke with me for a while, affirming me being there and validating how hard it was as a client.\n\nHis clinical supervisor was very kind and lovely. She reassured me a lot and told me she has my file now and she will keep it safe. She would like to do her best to set me up with another EMDR trained therapist and she will do her best to match me with the best one for me, because that is what my T would have wanted. She reminded me that they wouldn't be the same as my late T though, because he was a unicorn.",

She said “I really liked reading your posts, it helped me get to know you better, and I’m really proud of you for how hard you are working in therapy” 😭\n\nShe also said “I know reddit is going to drag me for snooping on you, and I know you are probably going to stop posting now. but I really hope you do keep posting, because you’re the Pope of TalkTherapy and your subjects need you”\n\nSo I might be posting here less, or maybe not.

He ended up asking for me for my snap and we hung out after the game and have hung out multiple times since. Now two weeks ago we were at a park together and had our first kiss and then he officially asked me to be his girlfriend and I said yes. Neither of us had told our parents any details at this point, just that we were hanging out, and my therapist has a really common last name so I obviously didn't suspect anything (I knew she had a son in high school but didn't know his name or where he went or anything.)\n\nLong story short he invited me over to his house 2 days ago and his mom came home while we were there. He called her over to introduce me and.....there was my therapist. It was possibly the most awkward moment of my whole life. We like made eye contact and she had a shocked look for a second but then acted like she didn't know me which I'm guessing is because of confidentiality stuff. Anyways she said she had work stuff to do and went upstairs and I made up an excuse to leave like a half hour later. She texted me the next day and said that we would talk about it in our next session because it needs to be talked about in person, but that's not for 3 days and I'm just freaking out about what to do now. I know she's probably gonna have to drop me which sucks cause I've seen her for two years now, but I really like her son and I don't want to end things with him. I'm just worried it's gonna be awkward forever now and that her sons gonna break up with me when he finds out. \n\nSorry for rambling but I guess I'm just looking for advice?",

As you can see from my post history, I am writing a lot on this subreddit because therapy is starting to change my life and this overwhelms me.\n\nMy therapist is REALLY good, I will never not say it. We took our time on our last session in order to explore my feeling of \"rage\" and of course she thinks that for the first time, I am elaborating my traumas. It is positive, I guess. She is making me self-aware and finally I am learning to recognize my emotions. I didn't think I could be capable of doing it but yet here I am.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, the most important aspect of my T is that she makes me feel SAFE. For the first time in my life, there is a person out there who respects my boundaries and KNOWS how to soothe me. She is amazing and this has started to make me re-evaluate my actual relationships. All I can think about is how the fuck did I survive without having basic human decency. I know that the relationship between a therapist and their patient is different from our everyday connections, but still... I think I don't want to settle for less? I want communication, I want to talk about boundaries, I want to listen and to be listened and I want to feel safe. Is that too much to ask or maybe I am just finally discovering what being \"healthy\" means?\n\nThe fact is... after our last session, I suddenly cut ties with my boyfriend. Since I have started therapy, our relationship went downhill because I started to show my emotional needs (my T made me realize I am not used to show them since it makes me feel guilty) and he didn't listen at all. Actually, he did the exact opposite (I am talking about basic things like the importance of consent when it comes to sex, and also the importance of communication in a couple). So when our session finished, I stopped replying to him and this went on until the next day. I know this is childish: my reason was that I really needed to elaborate some things I disclosed to my T and I didn't want my boyfriend to be a part of it. I wanted to preserve that \"safe\" feeling I get with my T and I knew talking to him would take it away. He knows that, because I had a panic attack in front of him once and he kept triggering me instead of soothing me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe next day, I described my thought process to him and I manifested my emotional needs again (he knows about my past and I told him the exact same things I am telling you now). He got really angry at me over the phone. He started shouting and attacking me and without a blink I blocked him everywhere and it was a relief.\n\nI am madly scared of abandonment. I have NEVER blocked a partner in my life because I have always preferred being in pain over being alone. I have NEVER assessed my boundaries in this way and ignoring someone never was in my chords. I have NEVER felt I was right. This is the first time.\n\nI don't know why, but a part of me thinks it is for the best? I am not scared of leaving people anymore because I feel safe now. I know that whatever happens, I can talk to my T about it. I can stand being alone now because I don't \"feel\" alone. I don't want to feel unsafe anymore just for the sake of having a relationship. I want to choose for myself as an adult would do. I am deciding to trust my gut.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCan anyone relate or am I over-exaggerating as usual?",

This time I could pick somebody. I went for one that looked right for me. He was very responsive, and on the very first day, we arranged our first video chat. He was a bit odd, but some of the things he said made sense, so I decided to book another video chat for the next day. Little did I know I was about to be humiliated and belittled by this man. The tone of the conversation was completely different. He implied that his life was almost perfect and that I should be like him. He also used his age to say I didn't know anything about life. I felt that everything I said was being used against me. At a certain moment, he wanted to imply I had signs of narcissism in me, and having suffered from narcissistic abuse pretty much my whole life, that was veeery hard to hear. I had never felt this unsafe with a therapist before. He admitted himself to being a narcissist. Close to the end of the session, while I couldn't stop crying and every time I tried to say something, I would cry even more, he said “now, you have one minute to share final your thoughts before our time is over”. He said it that way. Cold. Distant. Not addressing any of my emotions. \n\nAfter the session, I almost killed myself. I couldn't understand how I could live without hurting everyone around me. I felt that I deserved to disappear completely without any evidence of my existence because I was the source of the worst evil and everything that would ever come out of me was poisonous. \n\nThank God I found another therapist, OUTSIDE THIS APP, that pulled me back up and showed me why I am not a narcissist and that he (the narcissist therapist) should not be walking around trying to “help” anyone.\n\n***update***\nA person at Betterhelp contacted me apologising for the experience and that it was “100% unacceptable”. They asked me the therapist’s name and said that after receiving it, that they would “immediately escalate this to our clinical team”.\n\n***update 2***\nMy subscription was cancelled and I was refunded in 50% of what I had spent originally. I only used it for 4 days, so... not really happy with it.\n\n***edit***\nSince English is not my first language, I had to make some changes after having posted it. Also, I tried to maintain an impartial tone to my writing, bearing in mind that the app might actually help some people out there.

Setting boundaries, communication, grief, depression, anxiety, sexual trauma, blah blah blah and I've had a lot of different therapists. Like, a lot. I don't even want to tell you the number.\n\nAnd I finally got to the point this week where I challenged myself to sit in a quiet room without any distractions and just...listen. I took an early lunch break and headed to a small chapel in the hospital where I work. I walked into the empty, dimly-lit space and sat down against the wall. And I breathed.\n\nI listened to the anxious thoughts I was having. I whispered the thoughts out loud \"I feel like I'm suffocating. I don't want to be an essential worker. I want to go home. I hate this. I feel like everyone expects me to be busy and producing and not making mistakes and I feel like I'm just barely making it.\" \n\nAnd for the first time, I was able to listen to myself and respond with compassion. \n\nI whispered to myself \"I know it's hard. Everything you're feeling is okay. It's okay to feel anxious. It's okay to be upset. It may look like everybody else is fine, but I promise this is hard for everyone. I'm going to take care of you, okay? I'm here with you. I've got you. I love you.\"\n\nI can't tell you what a big deal this is. I've never been able to talk to myself compassionately before.

    "selftext": "So to begin this post, I want to preface it by saying I'm in school to be a therapist. Which is why it's so funny to me that I'm super mind-blown about this. So all of my past therapists have been heavy users of reflecting my thoughts back to me and that dreaded silence technique. I grew a lot from those sessions, so it's not like those methods didn't work for me, but I felt like I was rambling for ages and would get anxious before and during the sessions when they just silently stared at me. I never knew if I was supposed to just keep rambling or find my own solution in that space. And in school, these are the first things we're taught. 1) Reflecting core messages back to the client and 2) \"Get comfortable with silence\". And again, I'm not saying these are bad, they're just methods that work for some and not for others. \n\nBut I have a new therapist right now who actually has a conversation with me. She reflects some of what I say but also adds to it, and adds her own thoughts as well. I'm finding it really refreshing, comfortable, and still effective. There's no pauses, no awkwardness, and it's an even give-and-take of conversation. I don't have anxiety and because I'm already pretty self-aware, I don't have a big need to stay in silence and ramble more. I'm ready to jump in action and her pace and the way she works really is working for me too. I've always had positive impressions of my past therapists, but I'm excited that I've found something new that works for me and I'm thinking about how I'd like to incorporate this into my future work as well.",

    "selftext": "\n\n\nTW: minor mention of CSA\n\n\n\nThis is an update to my last post asking for advice on if my email was okay to send. I did end up sending it on Wednesday, and he responded a couple hours later with an email (in the picture I added). Even after his email which I found comforting, I was a nervous wreck until our session today. I ended up having to take a heavy dose of my anxiety medication before our session because I was having a panic attack at the thought of having to see him after sending that.\n\n\nBut… the session went great. I admitted to having erotic and paternal transference. He’s not terminating and has a strong desire to help me with this. He said he took my feelings as a compliment that he was a good therapist and doing a good job at making me feel cared for. He said that he wasn’t uncomfortable or upset, and told me that it’s not my fault I have these feelings. He said that I have no control over how certain people or traits make me feel and that my feelings themselves weren’t inappropriate but it would be if I acted on them. He opened up about his own infidelity in his marriage as an example and said that it wasn’t wrong to find other people attractive or have feelings, but that he made the mistake of acting on his emotions. I asked him if he wanted to put more boundaries in place for us but he said he didn’t feel that was necessary. He said he knew I wasn’t trying to pursue anything based off my behavior towards him, and said it was great I was maintaining boundaries even with my feelings.\n\nHe then complimented me on my vulnerability and honesty, and said I was really willing to do the work and try to get better.\n\nHe acknowledged that my pattern of having sexual feelings towards men that show me care is a result of the sexual abuse I received as a child from my father. And he reminded me again that it’s not my fault.\n\nWe’re going to make this the focus of therapy for awhile, and try to get me to separate feeling cared for and feeling sexual desire. Because at the moment my brain is hardwired to be like “oh this person is showing care and affection towards me, now I’m supposed to sleep with them”. He also wants to work on having me feel less shame in having these feelings.\n\nSo overall the session went really well and he handled it perfectly. I feel much better about the situation and it was great to get that off my chest. ",

They never will.\n\n**Because they don't think they did anything wrong.**\n\nThem traumatizing me...was them at their best...making decisions to better their own lives.\n\n**I never had the tools to convince them to change, because they never thought they needed to change in the first place**.\n\nI spent so many decades assuming I was a bad person. All those bad things happened to *me* for a *reason*, right?\n\nThose bad things happened to me...because...when people who have no self-awareness...have a child...and things go bad. *Who* do you think they'll blame?\n\nThey blame their child.\n\nEvery time.\n\nThey're so assured they did nothing wrong, they'll tear down their child's self-esteem...and walk away satisfied. Their child didn't denigrate *their* *character*. They \"won\".\n\nThat child grows into an adult with severe anxiety who seeks out abusive relationships. Who blames themself for being a bad, unlovable person. Who self-sabotages thinking the world will automatically hate and reject them. Who thinks everyone can see what a horrible person they are beneath a people-pleasing mask.\n\n**All of the self-blame and self-hatred I have...is the culmination of what my family projected onto me.

And I have to be honest about what that brings out in me. \n\nMe: Ok... \n\nMister T: When you start to panic, particularly toward the end of sessions, I feel the pull to take care of you and reassure you. I want to take on almost... the role of a father. I want to save you from it. But you don't need saving, Selfless. I had to take a step back and ask myself what you needed from me, and you are a strong, independent woman. You don't need saving. \n\nMe: *\\[insta-flustered\\]* I know what therapy is. I wasn't asking you to do anything beyond your role... I feel like I did something wrong. \n\nMister T: No. You didn't do anything wrong. This is just a reinstatement of the boundaries of this relationship. We're going to keep it to this office, and we're going to keep it to an hour. I'm going to work on empowering you to affirm yourself, and regulate yourself.\n\nMe: *\\[soooo fah-reaking defensive\\]* I feel like you're reviewing our boundaries because I crossed one. I want to state clearly, for the record, that I always tried to leave when the hour was up. *I brought my own fucking clock.* I'm trying to figure out right now what it is I was looking for from you.

Definitely. Selfless, I'm not going over boundaries because you crossed one. I'm mostly going over them... for me. \n\nMe: ... oh. \n\nMister T: I invited you to stay overtime. I called you during my vacation. You were not doing anything wrong. And I'm not talking to you about this and reining it in because I feel annoyed, or overwhelmed, or manipulated by you. I know you're worried about that. I don't. But I do want to re-think the way that I respond to your anxiety. Because you don't need a father, or someone to save you. You already showed me today that you are fully capable of doing that yourself. You need a therapist. One that supports and empowers you. And that might mean that I change the way I'm responding. \n\nMe: ... I'm feeling... bad. \n\nMister T: I'm so glad you told me. Because the purpose of this conversation is to *make sure* that you know that these changes are not because of something you did, and especially not because of something you did wrong. You have nothing to feel bad about. This is about me recognizing the pull to act as a father figure, as a protector, and instead of falling into that role, filling the role you need me to fill. \n\nMe: I just want to do things right, on my end. \n\nMister T: You're doing great. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nNow that I write it all out, I can see that he was articulating this well.

After a long pause and a grounding conversation about his motorcycle outside (which was gorgeous, btw), I told him I was feeling insecure about the conversation, still. And we talked about it again. The dude is patient AF. And he was right--it was so important that he told me \\*why\\* his approach may be changing going forward, because I would have hardcore blamed myself. I respect the hell out of him for bringing it up with clarity and respect. (Also I still feel bad. wtf.)\n\nIt was a weird, unexpected conversation, and I needed to \"talk it out\" somewhere.

I have a notebook called \"Shit my Therapist Says\" that's filled with quotes from you that make me laugh, smile, and sometimes cry. I love how kind and considerate you always were with me, how well you listened and how you adapted your practice to my needs even when it wasn't in your comfort zone. I love how sometimes I came to therapy and all I wanted to do was lay in your lap and cry, and we would sit with that thought without touching or speaking, but I could feel your tenderness and care for me and it was almost just as good, maybe better. I love your killer high heels and yoga pants combination and the way you rocked whatever you wore with total confidence. I love how easy it was to talk about the transference and how open you were about your counter-transference, how every thought, feeling and urge could be named and appreciated and worked with. I love the ease with which you were able to challenge me, and how easy it was to receive because it never felt like criticism. I love how sad we both were when the time came for you to refer me out because I needed more specialized care, how that referral felt like such an act of love rather than the rejection it could have felt like. I love how you really wanted to get me a small parting gift, but you remembered how awful gifts make me feel, so instead you just told me what you would have gotten me and we both agreed that it would have been a rad gift if I could have tolerated it. The thoughtfulness of the gift idea and of the reaction it would have caused was worth a thousand gifts.\n\nI think about you and miss you often, and just the thought of you on a bad day makes me feel better. Like today, today was shitty hard day and you made it brighter without even knowing it. Part of me hopes you read this and recognize yourself. Part of me hopes a whole bunch of therapists read this and recognize themselves, because it would mean there are others like you out there, doing good and healing the deepest of traumas with their genuine care.\n\nYou are worth your weight in gold.

I don't really know who's going to care about this now since it's been so long, but I can't sleep so I decided to make another update post about how things have been with my bf and his mom (my ex therapist). \n\nEverything went super great switching therapists, the one I have now is amazing (and I'm about to graduate to every other week sessions!) so I think that's been the easiest part of all of this tbh. Anyways, like me and my bf agreed on, for the first like 3 or 4 months after finding out he was my therapists son, we didn't go to his house at all, and I definitely think that was the right call cause the break definitely helped me see his mom as less therapist-y. We finally said I love you (very exciting!!) and at that point decided it was probably serious enough that it was going to be important to be able to know his family more. We planned just a casual movie night at his place and I was literally so nervous I thought I was going to throw up, but once I got there it really wasn't bad at all. It was a little awkward at first, but then once i got settled in I realized it was actually super nice to be able to see my old therapist again and like catch her up on my life (not like in a therapy way don't worry) because i did miss her. and I thought it would be weird knowing that she knows a ton about me, but honestly I feel like it's kind of made me feel safer being there if that makes any sense? Like I like that we already had trust built and I don't have to stress about whether or not she likes me or anything like that. and it can be awkward still sometimes, but I think our relationship dynamic (i think that's the right term?) is finally starting to shift to a like more casual/fun vibe instead of like a professional one. I've also made sure to check in with my bf a lot to make sure it's still not weird for him, but he's still okay with it, and he actually makes jokes about it sometimes which is really funny. His dad is really nice too and he's got an adorable dog. He has an older sister too but I haven't met her cause she lives in a different state. \n\nSo overall things have been really really good. i'm glad everything happened the way it did because now I get to have all these incredible people in my life for hopefully a long time, and I feel like it's been really good practice for handling conflicts and stuff and learning communication skills. Sorry this isn't a super exciting update or anything, but I just wanted to share how things have been going :) ",

So many people on that website check every box so that they come up on more searches, and to me that demonstrates selfishness. These therapists care more about getting more patients than they care about actually providing people with the help they are looking for.\n\n[https://postimg.cc/NyMhhnr0](https://postimg.cc/NyMhhnr0)\n\nThis was on an actual person's profile.

    "title": "Our therapist no showed today after asking to reschedule appt",
    "selftext": "Background: Husband and I started couple's counseling two months ago. Since we started, we've had a standing 4pm appt every Friday. Yesterday at 1pm, the therapist texted to ask if we could reschedule because he had a family issue to deal with. We agreed and rescheduled for 10am, one of the time slots he suggested in his message, and moved some things around in our day to accommodate his request.\n\nThis morning, we got online to enter his waiting room. At 10:10, I asked my husband how long we should wait since he still hadn't  shown up. At 10:13, I texted the therapist and he said he forgot because he got wrapped up with storm prep.\n\nI responded that I was frustrated with the situation because we had agreed upon a new day/time and he made us sign an appt agreement when we started with his practice- if we don't give 24 hours notice to cancel OR we don't show for our appt, we will be charged a fee. In the past 24 hours, he did both. \n\nDuring our time together, this therapist has encouraged me to speak up for myself more often, encouraged us as a couple to use \"I\" statements when we speak, and encouraged us as a couple to not be defensive when receiving messges. The irony of all of these lessons isn't lost on me as I re-read his responses.\n\nI have attached our text exchange, beginning with yesterday's reschedule request. I'm gray, our therapist is teal. I am absolutely flabbergasted by his response, and I have not responded, as I'm still trying to figure out an appropriate response, which I will likely be emailing.\n\nAs I have run this through my head today, I am bothered by a few things:\n\n1) he takes no real accountability for not showing up today at the agreed upon time, rescheduled time per his request \n\n2) he has not made a sincere effort to try to fix this\n\n3) there is no acknowledgement of the fracture to the trust in our patient/therapist relationship \n\nAm I overreacting here? How should I be responding? Can this issue be fixed?",

    "selftext": "This is my third therapist now but will be going onto a fourth shortly. She was the first one I felt really good with and felt like I could open up to. I had initial concerns because my younger sister and mom both see her but I gave her a shot after the first two just didn’t seem to work out.\n\nEverything was great but sometimes she’d ask me “What do you think of your Mom” and I’d say things and she said “I’ll talk to her about them”. Since it was about a recent family fight it didn’t matter to me, brushed it off.  Another time is just talking ahout my family and what I thought was unfair she’d tell me what my sister said about the same topic and that she felt the same about certain things, while I didn’t see this an issue I also didn’t wanna hear anything about them.\n\nThe straw that broke the camel’s back for me was basically telling her (from my own experience) that my parents rarely ever fight, typically don’t yell and resolve things quickly. She proceeded to tell me I was wrong and “That’s not what my mom says” and that they DO fight a lot, my Dad doesn’t like talking about things and that it just wasn’t how I thought things were. At that point I had enough about hearing what they’ve said and just started to wonder what she would tell them about me. I believe it was unprofessional and a violation of trust and confidentiality after using my Mom’s words against me to prove me wrong over something I had a generally good reality of. I have no regrets and feel free to make that choice myself and move on.\n\nI sent her the following text.\n\n“I’m gonna cancel today. Was up all night and in no state of mind to do a phone call. I’m just going to sleep. Sorry for last minute cancellation, if my mom wants the slot she can take it but I will pay the fee it’s fine. I don’t think in general I wish to continue therapy with you. My trust has been revoked after you’d tell me stuff about my parents that I didn’t know or about my sister and it’s just a lack of confidentiality that makes me want to find someone else. I’m not interested in family counseling and having whatever I say not be kept a secret. Thank you for everything but I will not be returning. It’s not something that’s up for debate I just don’t think you’re the right fit for me”\n\n\n\nUPDATE: Wow did not expect such an overwhelming amount of responses. This is my first real time posting on reddit on my main account and the support is unbelievable. Thank you all for your suggestions, personal experiences and thoughts. I’m torn on telling my Mom because then she’ll probably be inclined to ask my old therapist about more stuff and just not sure if it would benefit her to know that she was doing that. My sister usually blows off therapy and my mom just takes the rest of the session (over the phone) but god now I can see why my sister is like that. Thank you all. I absolutely agree with all of you but I don’t think I’ll report her because I just don’t have it in me to potentially ruin someone like that. Even if she deserves it I will say anything I said isn’t something I could never come back from (mainly cause I cut things off sooner rather than later) and I will follow up with her to tell her why what she did was wrong and give her my own experience in more depth of how I felt violated after trusting her. I feel a lot of relief right now and have just been personally journaling to keep thoughts and things at bay. I hope you all have better therapists and experience then I have. I will absolutely make sure I see one that won’t see my family. Cheers to everyone. Here’s to better mental health.",

    "selftext": "I went to a new therapist (my third one) honestly ready to hate every second of it and just feel awful and awkward the whole time. Just going with the mindset “It’s good to get out of your comfort zone, whether or not this helps.” Instead the guy was absolutely awesome.\n\n I was extremely nervous but unlike the other two T’s I’ve been to, he didn’t point it out. He didn’t even seem to notice, or if he did, he didn’t let it affect the way he acted. He was calm and collected. When I struggled to answer questions he didn’t force me to sit with it and require an answer, he just kinda.. moved on. Said it was fine and normal not to have answers. I swear it was insane, it was like even though I was bringing the most insane anxiety it just didn’t bother him at all. He just kept going and it was SO NICE to not have someone trying to force me to calm down the whole time. It helped me manage it on my own and his calm nonchalance was so nice. \n\nDespite being kind of calm and indifferent, he wasn’t dismissive of anything I said! He was listening actively and encouraging me to talk without staring me down or employing silence to force it. Few topics were a bit uncomfortable but that’s to be expected talking to a stranger about your life. He didn’t over-talk me at all and even when I accidentally talked over him he just encouraged *me* to keep going.\n\nHe made me feel normal, which is just.. crazy. I could cry I’m so happy. I’m just so happy I didn’t stay with either of the last ones after a few sessions. This is definitely what therapy is meant to feel like. \n\nTLDR- It payed off going through the pain of switching therapists rather than just settling and hoping it would get better.",

    "selftext": "I'm nowhere near done with therapy, but I've been seeing my T for a while now – long enough to get attached, to love her, to be loved by her, to have made immense progress, and to be proud of myself. I am unendingly grateful to her for the big changes and the little changes – and for the unexpected changes, the strange and funny ones. I noticed something today that I thought would be nice to share:\n\nI grew up with a mother who encouraged healthy eating to the detriment of a well-rounded diet. (She's likely orthorexic.) As such, I ended up being 'weird with food,' fearful of anything 'forbidden' yet craving it desperately. I've gotten much better over the years, but certain foods still scare me. One of those is pizza – that glorious, melted-cheese, spicy-pepperoni, charred-crust-dipped-in-garlic-butter, eat-it-so-fast-you-nearly-scald-your-mouth, decadent, heavenly, terrifying dish. I've never been able to enjoy it properly.\n\nWell – that was accurate up until last week, when my T off-handedly mentioned the pizza she'd had for dinner the night before. I didn't think anything of it at the time, but on Thursday I was at the grocery store and found myself in front of the pizzas in the frozen aisle. I remember thinking something like: 'if my T, whom I adore and respect and whose judgment I trust completely, can eat a pizza, surely I can too?' \n\nAnd somehow that made everything simple. I brought the pizza home and ate it, and it was delicious. Then, riding on a high, last night I had mac and cheese – wonderful. I've been missing out. I never would've thought my T eating takeout pizza would have such an effect, but I am grateful for the change. But what an absurd catalyst!\n\nThat was needlessly long, lol sorry. I think I got carried away. But I'm super curious to hear what small, strange, or funny ways your T has had an effect on any of you!",

    "title": "Dating my ex-therapist and then understanding why this is considered a breach of ethics",
    "selftext": "Prefacing by noting this is a bit long: I discuss power dynamics, transference/countertransference, and unethical therapeutic behavior against code of conduct.  This was a relationship that happened within the past year. \n\nBasically, I (female) was in high school and had a school counselor/therapist who was assigned to work with me for everything pertaining to scheduling/emotional support.  \n\nIn my final year of school, she helped work me through my issues coming out (I’m a gay woman) to my family and friends, who are all quite conservative, and to the shame I had about breaking up with a boyfriend I had that I didn’t like but kept around because of my own fear of my sexual orientation (I grew up religious and in a small conservative community).  Was so refreshing to hear support and feel cared about by my therapist, as it made my lonely teenage self feel seen and validated.\n\nI then graduated, and simultaneously she had left that position to work in more private practice rather than school setting.  I turned 18.  And a few months later, we met up as friends, hanging out and talking and messaging quite often.  I felt cool being friends with this woman (around mid thirties) as I entered my own adulthood.  She’d invite me over and we would just talk for hours laughing and having these deep conversations, and a really close bond was formed in which she said she had strong motherly instincts for me and just wanted to protect me.  It felt warm.  We grew attached.\n\nAnd then, not even a year since we had our last official therapy session when I was a high school senior, we kissed in her bed.  And more happened.  And i knew I was in love; she was too. \n\nI soon moved in secretly. It felt wonderful at first.  We felt like we were fighting against the world who didn’t understand our love.  That is, until the dynamics of our therapy bled into our romantic relationship, in which any time I would speak about my feelings triggered her due to it being similar to therapy.  Or where I felt complete need to be emotionally available to listen and console and support her, overcompensating for a massive age gap and trying to undo the foundation therapeutic relationship meant to be one-sided support.\n\nEventually, people found out.  My old school caught wind, and I’m shocked nothing bigger happened (I have a feeling if she was a man, there would have been a much bigger feeling of unease about this).  My parents found out, and they were more bothered by her being a woman than her being my ex-therapist. \n\nThe word finding out brought us together even tighter, despite the cracks in our relationship showcasing some toxicity in terms of inability to feel grounded and solid to navigate our feelings and emotions.  I think I stayed in this relationship for far too long (four years) for fear of admitting the unethical beginnings of us were unethical for the reason it was harmful.\n\nWe eventually broke up.  I moved out.  It was painful and hard and I felt the world shatter around me as she was all I knew since I was 18.  And then I realized our relationship was not meant to have begun in the first place.  That I may have fallen in love with her because of the transference that was happening regarding me accepting my sexual orientation.  And maybe she had some counter transference going on in those sessions as well. \n\nI’m one year out of this relationship now.  And have spent this time processing what I got myself involved in with a separate mental health professional, in which I recognize that I entered a relationship with the deck of cards stacked in neither of our favors, playing cards on a table that was slanted against mine especially.  \n\nI’ve experienced guilt that I became involved with a woman i shouldn’t have been with, blaming myself for perhaps unconsciously crossing boundaries as I unknowingly fell in love with her.  I have had to learn to accept it was my ex therapist’s responsibility to uphold the boundaries of a healthy therapeutic relationship.  \n\nI’ve had to admit to myself and to my past friends that though I attested that everything was fine and happened with me a willing participant while in said relationship, the nuances of the emotionally vulnerable state I was in during our sessions made it much easier for me to grow a false sense of attachment to my therapist turned girlfriend. \n\nI’ve spoken to few people about this who didn’t know her or who I was back then.  There’s a bit of trauma I’m healing from, and some suggest to report her to her licensing board due to the misconduct.  I don’t think I have the will/desire to do so, though I do wonder if she’s fit to keep her practice running with something like this happening in her life.\n\nI do not regret the relationship we had; however, I do know it wasn’t meant to happen and really crossed some major lines to the detriment of us both. \n\nKeen to hear input, opinions, and any stories you have to share about this topic.  Thanks.",

    "selftext": "Before I started doing therapy two years ago, I had a really idealized view of therapy. I had a respect for the profession. After all, being a psychologist requires years of schooling and training. Why wouldn't you respect the profession? They're medical professionals.\n\nSince then, I have all but lost my respect for the profession. I have spoken to 6 therapists and my experiences ranged from mediocre to outright harmful. It blows my mind that somebody will go to school for YEARS, ostensibly to learn about the human psyche and to help people, and then in practice they just sit there giving you mediocre advice. The advice these \"medical professionals\" have given me is on par with the advice I get from friends with no degree, no training, nothing. I honestly feel like psychotherapy is bunk.",

It took me years to find the modality that works for me (psychoanalysis) and to have the kind of healthcare and financial situation that allows me to see this T who would otherwise be astronomically expensive.   \n\n\nMy wife, on the other hand, recently quit therapy. She tried for months, but he could not keep up with her vocabulary, rarely led her to insight, and often aggravated symptoms by giving her harmful lenses. I feel guilty because I encouraged her, ever week, to continue seeing this guy. I believed I was doing the right thing because I was encouraging and supporting her to get care. Once she sat me down to have a long talk about her misgivings, I agreed she should try to find someone else.   \n\n\nUnfortunately...there is no one else. We live in a major mid western city (smaller than Chicago, but bigger than Indianapolis). We have called every therapist that takes our insurance and we have not been able to find anyone who works in the modalities that she needs, will meet on evenings/weekends, and is currently taking new clients. \n\n I am so grateful for my therapist, but I think for everyone who struggles, it is worth admitting that there are many therapists who do not fit/are not terribly gifted in their work. It doesn't mean one ought to give up trying, just that it is not a personal failing if you find yourself needing to quit therapy. Go ahead and quit if your therapist sucks.",

Simply through availability, listening, compassion, and maybe a bit of challenge here and there, but in an authentic way. I've seen and spoken to so many therapists who seem to only be able to apply techniques and have strict belief systems about people and their problems instead of meeting who's in front of them. It's been agonising walking around with trauma as a therapist myself, and just again and again being disappointed by therapists limited capacities to be themselves and relate and reflect on themselves instead of hiding behind tricks and being defensive about the specific tricks they apply. I don't need tricks I need a relationship! If anything it at least increases my own empathy for my clients... But I'd like some proper help myself too.",

I really did have them in a pedestal and mainly wanted to make my father proud. So I went to college and got a bachelors degree in legal studies and international law and....\nI completely hated it! The more I learned about the way the criminal justice system worked the more I hated law. I was immensely miserable and just couldn’t sacrifice my life to follow a dream that wasn’t mine. So, after I graduated... I reapplied elsewhere for a second bachelors degree in psychology. \n\nYou see, I was raped and abused at 15 by my dads eldest son... after that of course I was diagnosed with PTSD. Looking back (I’m 26 now) I realize that the more I learned about psychology and mental health topics like my own, the more “healed” I felt. But again... I really put my parents in a high pedestal.

    "title": "One Therapist's Point Of View On Liking Clients and Money",
    "selftext": "I see a lot of posts on here about whether or not therapists care about their clients or like their clients “really.” I also see posts about paying for the therapy service. I have been a therapist for 10 years and I will share my honest personal experience.\n\n\n\nLiking A Client\n\nI really can’t think of a client on my current roster I don’t “like” because I’m truly not thinking like that. The neutrality that people find annoying about therapists can be genuine. I have clients ask me questions like “Do you think I’m crazy/selfish/annoying?” and I have to take a step back in those moments. Not because I am afraid to say yes, but because I am not thinking like that while I have my therapist hat on. I am not judging things as good or bad, I am trying to understand the why. My job in the session is to be curious and judgement kills curiosity. I am thinking “Hmm I just made a suggestion and I sense some resistance here, how can I explore that resistance?” Not “Oh this client is being annoying because they are resisting me.”\n\nI don’t know how to explain it fully, but the vast vast majority of the time I don’t like or dislike a client. There will be that rare client that slips through my screening process that I don’t feel like I understand and that is frustrating. Like everything I say to check for understanding they will say no to. Ex. “So it seems like you are frustrated at your mom?” Client: “I’m not frustrated at my mom I just wish she would…” This is hard because I really try to understand, but I wouldn’t say I dislike this person. I just feel like we don’t get very far.\n\n\n\nDo I Care About My Clients?\n\nIt’s hard to explain how you can so fully connect and be immersed in someone’s life for one hour a week. It’s hard to explain how you can care so deeply and yet let them go over and over again after every session. Sometimes I think about my clients during the rest of the week and sometimes I don’t, but it doesn’t define if I care for them or not. You learn early on it doesn’t do any good worrying about your clients in your off time. It doesn’t help them or you. I want to be present in my own life when I’m not working. That doesn’t mean I don’t care for or love my clients.\n\nThe best analogy I can come up with is that working with a client is like going to their house. I enter their world, with it’s own logic and rules for an hour. In this house you put your coffee mug here, take your shoes off, etc. Every house is different, but I never confuse them, once inside I remember everything. The client has many different rooms we explore in their house. With some clients, I feel like I know every nook and cranny of their house, though I’m sure that’s not true. I can’t know everything. I like stepping into someone’s world/house. It’s interesting, just like walking around someone’s actual home. \n\nOccasionally, I will see that a client has the same rug/towels/fridge as me. I can point this out to the client if I believe it will be helpful, but the client will never go into my home to see my rug. I can only tell them the rugs are the same in a general way. I can tell them this is how I care for my rug, but they will never see me vacuuming. This feels very safe to me. I get to bring my authentic self to session, but I don’t have to show my house, my layout, my struggles. In my personal relationships people come into my home and dirty the place up. I am affected by the behaviors and choices of those in my personal life. I’m not saying that client’s can’t hurt me, they have. It’s just easier to process that hurt because our lives aren’t intertwined. Our selves are intertwined, but not our lives. Being a therapist is a huge responsibility because I know what I say and do can have great effect, but also my clients will never be annoyed with me because I don’t do the dishes before I go to bed. And that’s nice. I would encourage anyone struggling with feeling close to their therapist, but feeling pained the relationship can’t be “more” (more time, friendship, more love from the therapist) to consider how nice it is not to know all the things about your therapist that would annoy the shit out of you :)\n\n  \n  \nBuilding A Relationship From Nothing \n\nSometimes in the first or second session I don’t yet understand a client or I don’t feel like they are being genuine with me, so I don’t care about them on a deeper level. I’m just being professional at that point. But pretty much with every client by the 4th or 5th session I’m able to feel like I understand them enough and have developed a deep compassion for them. Sometimes because I can see how hard they are trying, but how scared they are to be in therapy, how much they want change for themselves. If you’ve come to 5 sessions you are generally trying. People who don’t want to put in work drop off after one or two sessions. \n\nI genuinely admire and feel awe towards the vast majority of my clients. It is amazing to see what people survive and how they want to do better for themselves or their loved ones than what they were given. I feel such compassion for their struggles. I feel such love for them. We see a very different side of people, a vulnerable side of people, and when you see that hurt child inside you can’t feel anything but sympathy.\n\nSome clients have really rough exteriors. They’ve never told another person how they feel in an unguarded manner, so it’s awkward or they avoid it or it seems like they hate therapy. In the beginning of my career this was hard to tolerate. I hated those sessions because I felt so uncomfortable. Now, I can honestly say it doesn’t bother me. I know my job in those sessions and I do it, unattached to the outcome of them opening up. Why? Because I know what I can control and what I can’t. Most of the time those clients open up eventually and it’s very rewarding work. Some of the time they don’t make progress either because I’m not the right therapist for them or they aren’t ready yet. And I can honestly say that’s okay. I just had a termination session with a client last week who wanted to place the blame on his external circumstance rather than look at his beliefs and patterns. After months of trying and exploration, I genuinely wish that person well and release them. \n\n\n\nMoney\n\nI see clients through a group private practice and make a set rate per client hour. I never try to get a client to schedule more sessions for money and if a client cancels I never feel upset losing that money individually. I’ve been a therapist long enough to know that no matter what people will cancel and I take on more clients than I need to to cover the weeks when I have cancellations or it’s slow getting new clients. How often do I think about my clients paying me? Literally never unless they bring it up. I think about it as a cluster. Like I have about 30 clients (some are every other week or monthly). The cluster pays me. I never think about an individual paying me. This may be because I don’t actually charge the clients, my group practice does. I like this because I need to make money, but money really isn’t a consideration in my treatment. I think clients think about the money much more than the therapists do.\n\n  \nI hope any of this was helpful!\n\n",

They have also not cancelled or postponed a session even once (I find this amazing) during these surreal months; they have been constant and considered even when their world must also be a strange, new place.  \n\n\nI am so incredibly grateful for their care, presence and postive regard. I will, of course, be telling them (some of) this when I see them, but I just wanted to put it out there so that other therapists know that their efforts during these times do not go unnoticed. So many of us would not be able to do our jobs, be present in our relationships, or even care enough about ourselves without the support and constancy of our therapists.",

Other than this she would occasionally turn away from the screen to scream at her children. I didn’t immediately look for another counsellor because she still seemed helpful with my other issues, it was after I turned down conversion therapy that she messaged me through the app to let me know that we weren’t a fit and I should specify my sexual preferences next time I look for a counsellor.

I knew it was time to work on all this bullshit from my past traumas (whose depth is eternal). Searched for quite awhile for the right T. Almost gave up. \n\nTook a chance on someone literally 2 miles from my house 3-4 months ago and clicked immediately. Like, I couldn’t believe it.\n\nAfter like a month (oof, lol), I could tell the maternal transference was sinking in. I tried to pump the breaks on it emotionally and I let it strangle me for over 2 months. \n\nI finally decided to write a letter a couple weeks ago. Wasn’t gonna send it, just needed to get it out of my fucking soul and release the pressure valve a little. And y’all, it was a horror show of a letter. The most vulnerable and honest thing I’ve ever said (or written, I suppose) to another human being.\n\nFinally sent it Sunday night and I’ve been a real dumpster fire ever since. She responded today.

    "selftext": "I've been seeing my therapist via Telehealth biweekly since May of this year. She has told me now on three separate occasions that she doesn't like me. The first time she said it- I kind of wrote it off, I wasn't sure if she was directly saying it to me. Often in session she'll use this type of perspective as if she's me talking to someone in my life, she also speaks very quickly and has an odd, sarcastic style of humor. When I first heard her say it, it was kind of thrown in a long paragraph about something unrelated to our relationship. She said it like, \"....now, I don't like you, but...\". It threw me off guard, but she sandwiched it between talking about something serious that I had brought up in my personal life and I wasn't 100% that I had heard her correctly. I assumed she said \"...now I'm not like you\".\n\nLater on in the same session she said it again \"I don't like you\". This time, I said excuse me I don't think I heard you correctly. Now, it's silly, but I can't remember everything she said after that, I just remember she started the next sentence with \"well, it's not that I don't like you but...\". This session was in the middle of a very hectic week- I honestly quickly forgot because my attention was being thrown in 100 different places.\n\nThe next session happened and she didn't say anything odd like that and I had already forgotten. Then my most recent session happened this week and she said it again. This time it was at the end of our session. I was getting ready to sign out, we were saying goodbye and she said, \"You're getting better, I may not like you, but you're getting better\".\n\nHow do I respond? I definitely feel like I don't want to see her anymore. Is this an appropriate thing for a therapist to say to their client?\n\nEDIT: I just want to thank everyone for their thoughtful replies. I've definitely made the decision to stop seeing her and will let the clinic she works at know about the comments she made. \n\nAfter thinking about it for a little longer I started to remember more of what she said when I first asked for clarification. She essentially told me that she doesn't dislike me, but that she doesn't like me either... like I'm in some sort of neutral \"like-zone\"... I guess? I can't remember the exact language. She also said that she doesn't like any of her clients because it's not her job to like any of her clients and the relationship isn't supposed to be that way, or something like that. She did say she \"cared\" for all her clients. I'm surprised I forgot this part of the conversation, but it was a wild week when she first said it and memory is weird. \n\nAs for her justification, I don't think it is her job to like me, but I agree with what everyone is saying- she really didn't need to share it with me and she really doesn't need to keep bringing it up. It's always been wildly off topic whenever she has said it and honestly hasn't benefited me in any way. There's a time in my life where this would have wrecked me and I can really see this comment as being harmful to certain types of patients even with her weird explanation. \n\nSo yeah, I'm going to let the clinic know she said that. One of my issues is my fear of confrontation and I feel like telling her my feelings about the comment directly is a boss-level my anxiety ain't ready for yet. ",

    "selftext": "Positive story time. Sorry if this is long... I just wanted to tell someone and this is the only community that would get it, lol. \n\nBackstory: One of my biggest hurdles in getting back into school was my anxiety. I completed one year of university after high school and had to drop out (and lose my scholarship which I needed since I grew up extremely poor) when a family member became ill and I had to work to provide and care for them. My existing depression worsened and I developed debilitating anxiety over the years. I applied to go back to school every year but never followed through out of fear. I started therapy for the first time last year in my late 20s and besides working on my mental health, one of my biggest personal goals was to finish my degree. My therapist pushed me and supported me the entire way to get back into school. I called her TWICE crying from my car on campus before I had to meet with an advisor to register for classes. I was too anxious and full of doubt to go inside. At one point she even offered to come with me to register for classes. I didn’t let her - but the fact that she offered meant so much to me and made me feel like someone believed in me. It gave me the push to finally do it. \n\nNow: I just finished my second year of university with a 3.94 GPA. I worked full time and took 5 classes each semester (I’m an all or nothing type of person). My therapist has often told me that she is proud of me, but I never believe her. I never felt proud of myself because I still feel so behind in life compared to a lot of my peers and colleagues. I was always ashamed and felt like a fraud. \n\nYesterday she said, “you pushed through your fears of not being good enough and accomplished so much this year. I hope you can see that. You are so capable, (lobstertail2). I am so proud of you. Do you feel proud?”\n\nI cried. Instantly. For 20 minutes. I don’t cry in session. I think I actually believed her this time when she said she was proud of me. And first the first time in 10 years, I might feel a *little* proud of myself. It was a big breakthrough for me. I told her I’m dedicating my degree to her whenever I finally graduate. Having someone (even a therapist) that believes in you and supports you is truly so healing, even as an adult. 😭\n\n\nETA: You guys! Wow, thank you all  for your kind and  encouraging comments. I was not expecting that at all. I got teary-eyed reading them, lol. \n\nThis is actually really huge for me because I don’t even tell most people I’m back in school because: 1. I am ashamed of not finishing in the first place, and 2. I wasn’t sure I was smart enough/capable of doing it and didn’t want to have to admit to failing or dropping out. \n\nWriting this has really helped me reflect on where I started a year and a half ago. Shame is a hell of a roadblock.",

    "title": "My Therapist Died This Week (tw: suicide)",
    "selftext": "My therapist of nearly three years took her own life this week. I'm still shocked, devastated, confused, feeling this loss as deeply as when I lost my mother when I was eleven. I was processing a lot of maternal transference, beginning psychoanalysis, digging deeper and working through childhood trauma, abuse, depression, body dysmorphia, disorganized attachment, and abandonment issues.\n\nI resisted attachment, of getting too close, even as I yearned for closeness with her, for fear of her eventually finding me to be \"too much\" and dumping me. She would assure me \"Where am I going? I'm going to be here for you!\" but now she's not. I feel guilty about making this about me, but she abandoned me in the end. I'm not quite feeling angry with her about it yet, but others in my life that I've reached out to in my grief have expressed anger for me, anger at her, her analyst, the school where she was a candidate, her numerous supervisors, for not seeing that she was struggling, that she needed help.\n\nShe didn't disclose much to me about her struggles, of course, aside from sometimes just noting that she'd been through or had experience with some of the same things that I have. We were close emotionally, but she's still mostly a stranger to me. I feel guilty about any burdening that I contributed to now, of what may have been triggering for her, but honestly I never in a million years would've considered that my therapy with her would've ended this way.\n\nI've been replying our last, and now final session in my head over the past few days. How she brought up that she wanted us to slow down a little with my regression into a younger self, that she was afraid I'd hurt myself if we continued. Was she projecting? Was she talking about herself then? Did she already know that she was going to do this, already made plans when we last spoke?\n\nI knew something was wrong two minutes after she was late to open the door to her waiting room on Tuesday night. She was always so punctual, so perfectly on time. She'd only ever cancelled one session before, back in March, when she had an emergency come up, and then she texted me (we only ever really texted about scheduling - save for a few articles here or there that she'd send me links to). I wonder now if that emergency was related to this. Thinking of my memories of my time with her, of everything that she ever said, I'm now tying it to this one horrific act at the end of her life.\n\nI'm beside myself with grief. I don't know why I think it would land better if she died in some kind of accident, a heart attack, etc., but this one just hurts more. My mind keeps spinning out to all the dark places, to questions I'll never have the answers to. Did she leave a note? How did she do it? Was she thinking of me in the end? Did something else happen in her life to precipitate this? I keep imagining ways that she could've been found, or wondering how long until someone discovered her body, and it's driving me crazy, and I was already a literal mental patient! I'm trying to resist the urge to show up to her office at our usual time next week, what, just to wait until she's not there to open there door again? Why would I do that to myself? And yet... I'm not ready to let her go.\n\nI came to love her very much throughout our time together, and feel like I got to know her a bit even without knowing things *about* her, but now I'm questioning how much I ever knew her. I feel lost. She's the one I'd be bringing these thoughts to, she's the one who would be taking care of me through this, and now she's gone. I'm feeling her loss, the loss of this caring person in my life, the loss of the future of building towards something, getting better, her investment in my progress, and in me personally.\n\nShe's told me that she loves me, that I'm \"incredibly important\" to her, that she looked forward to seeing me, thought about me a lot whenever we had a break like a vacation or something, and missed me \"terribly.\" I'm feeling awful about my pushback on all of these kind things, on not being able to accept or fully feel them, or to feel them, but as she put it, to not be able to hold onto them. I told her that I didn't understand why I'd be important to her, that it didn't make sense to me. She said that made her very sad.\n\nOne of my favorite things that anyone's ever said to me she just said a few weeks ago. My father passed away last month of a long and lingering illness, and she noted that I was more subdued than usual. \"Still an exclamation mark, just maybe a little bit smaller one.\" She was an exclamation mark too, so expressive and giving of herself. I'm sad she had a boundary about hugs, and that I never got to hug her, even if I probably never would've anyway, ever, given her boundary, I wish I had that memory to hold onto now.\n\nThis grief feels like too much now. I regret any unkind or \"provocative\" thing I've ever said to her, any complaint that I ever had that she wasn't responding to me correctly, or not loving me in the *right* way. That she was ever not enough for me.\n\nI'm glad that she and I shared a warm and tender moment near the end of our last session, and it wasn't one of the ones where I got angry with her and left with a snarky quip. We were both crying after I'd talked about a loss in my life. She had previously held back on crying much, because she said that she didn't want me to feel the need to comfort her. This time she wept with me, and asked if I was okay with her crying. I said I was, and she said that's good, because she can't really help it. Those moments where we didn't say anything and just held eye-contact were among my favorite with her, even if now I'll remember her with a single tear running down her cheek. \n\nI know I'm not her therapist, and couldn't have seen this coming, but I wish I knew that something was off. I wish I could've reached out. My last contact with her was a week ago today, when I was making family holiday plans and asked if she thought she'd be available the week of Thanksgiving. She replied \"I should be around, yes.\" and those are her last words to me.\n\nShe *should* be around! I feel like I need someone to talk to about this new trauma, this new loss, but the thought of finding a new therapist right now (there's no replacing her) makes me feel sick.\n\nI don't know if anyone else has lost a therapist this way. I'm seeking out solace in reading other people's accounts in r/SuicideBereavement but I'm not sure it's making me feel better, because people are talking about other loved ones. I think suicide always feels like a betrayal in some ways, but it feels doubly so when that person on whom I grew to be dependent for holding some of my emotions with me dropped the ball.",

I’ve finally been pushing myself to really open up to him about the things I feel and to stop being so terrified of being vulnerable. It’s been really really difficult and spiking my anxiety and I’ve had this nagging feeling for most of my therapy that my therapist just didn’t like me. That I was probably one of his annoying clients that he dreaded appointments with. I guess it was something that manifested from my own lack of self worth, because I talked to him about it. \n\nI told him how worthless I feel all the time and he asked me if I could think of anything that gives me worth as a person. I told him I couldn’t and that I feel I’m not a lovable or even likeable person and then I admitted to him that I felt like a problem client to him. He told me that he actually likes me a lot and that he thinks I’m a good, intelligent person and that I deserve to know that I have the right to be respected and loved by others and that when I reached back out to him after moving back in-state, he was excited to hear from me and see how I’m doing and that he’s genuinely upset that I’m not doing well. \n\nIt made me cry because no one in my life has ever said anything like that to me. I’ve never felt like I was even liked by most people, let alone that someone would be excited to hear from me. It feels really foreign, and my brain keeps trying to tell me that he’s lying to me, but I’m working really hard to accept that maybe I am a likeable person.",

She says thank you all for making her whole week!\n\nBackstory: I have a chronic illness that sometimes completely destroys my body and ruins my ability to think. \n\nSo my last session, I almost cancelled because I was in so much pain the night before and that day (I still am tbh) that I didn’t sleep at all and I drive 45 minutes for therapy. I decided to suck it up, drink a monster, and drive with my windows down in 30 degree weather with music blasting to make it there safely. \n\nI show up and as she walks me into her office I said “you get what you get today, I didn’t sleep at all last night.” and plopped ever so dramatically on the couch, kicked my slippers off and curled up with my blanket and stuffed animal. She doesn’t even pause and just says “that’s fair. was something going on?” and so I told her I’m entering a flare up. T says “girl, it’s totally fine, I’m exhausted too. We can always just take a nap for an hour”\n\nI told her that I was considering it, to which she said “I will literally lay on the floor with my blanket, I’m so serious” and I was like “i know you are, and I’m tempted. but if I sleep now, I won’t sleep tonight.”\n\nSo T kicks off her shoes and puts her feet up on the arm of the chair next to her and I kid you not for the first half hour of session we watched tiktoks, laughed way too hard at nonsense, and neither of us could say words properly because our brains were just dead. I know some people might think it’s a waste of my money or a session, but when sessions go like this on occasion, it actually really helps me. Getting to see my T relax and be herself allows me to relax more too. By the end of session, I had started talking a pretty in depth about some trauma I’ve not been able to touch on in months without even realizing it. \n\nI’m just so thankful that I have an amazing T that just goes with the flow because that’s what gets me to do my best work in therapy! So, T’s in here I want to let you know how much these little things are appreciated!!",

    "selftext": "Let me start out by saying that I love my therapist. She has been helping me a lot and I imagine I will continue to see her for years to come. However there is one thing I’m still having trouble getting over so I’m wondering if anyone has had a similar experience and has any tips. \n\nBasically, she is extremely wealthy. And when I say wealthy, I mean wealthier than anyone I’ve ever met before. Her dad is a billionaire. No, I’m not exaggerating. A billionaire on the Forbes list. I made the mistake of looking her up online, as many of us do, and found out this information a few months into seeing her. \n\nI was able to get past that at first, but I think what really bothers me is her display of wealth during our sessions. I’m into fashion so I can’t help but notice what she wears. $2,000+ blouses, $7,000 jackets, $3,000 bags, multiple pairs of $1,000 loafers, etc. A lot of what she wears also has obvious logos on it so it would be hard not to notice. Some days I am crying over barely being able to pay a month’s rent while she’s sitting in front of me wearing what would cover my rent for a whole year. I know. I sound crazy. But I can’t stop noticing what she wears and thinking of the dollar amount! Sometimes I even look up her clothing online to see how much it costs…it’s like an addiction. I don’t think she’s ever worn a single clothing item that costs under $200. \n\nEventually I had to bring this up in session. We talked through it and it was clear to me, and always has been, that she would not be in this job if she didn’t care so deeply about it and about her patients. But I guess sometimes I still feel like she could never fully relate to actually struggling to pay the bills since she’s been so privileged her entire life. At the end of the day I know that money isn’t the answer to everything and all that. And I know she has had her fair share of struggles. Like I said, she’s a great therapist who has helped me a ton and I do not want to stop seeing her. I just want to get past being obsessed with this detail about her. I think at the end of the day I’m just super jealous because I wish I could have her wardrobe. I grew up with parents constantly fighting about money, so I think that’s impacted me. And I’m currently so stressed about money and surviving financially so it’s hard not to be thinking about it all the time. \n\nany advice? ",

Any advice on how to handle it would be appreciated!\n\nA few added details - it was the patient information that was troubling to me. The drinking was questionable for someone in healthcare doing patient work but that not for me to police. She and her husband were on their way to a vacation and professional conference that they go to every year, posting selfies and telling passengers around them. As for personal feedback, they were not approachable to say the least. Her husband said to \"not look at other people's computers,\" which is totally fair, but also it wasn't hard to see. The patient name of the file she was in was in large letters across the top. I would be really upset if my therapist had my patient notes on view for others. The only reason I took to reddit was because I don't want to ruin someone's career over an error, but this seems like PII 101 and they weren't really open to seeing that they might be making any error.

We started out talking about other stuff as if it were a normal session, then at one point they asked if I wanted to talk about the website. I obviously didn't want to but also knew it was necessary.\n\nI jotted down some things they said:\n\n* \"First, I want to say that I'm not going to abandon you\"\n* “I’m so enthusiastic that it is a thing we can work on\" (?!)\n* \"There is a lot in here that is tremendously useful for our work\"\n* \"I wish I had a highlighter because I have a lot of notes\"\n* “I’m looking forward to working through it and getting closer with you”\n* \"You probably reacted to the genuine love and care I have for you\"\n\nAt the end of the session, I said, \"Thank you so much for treating me like a normal person.\" \"I will never not,\" they replied. I almost cried.\n\nMy mind is blown that they were *completely* unfazed (and almost chipper?) about the whole thing. I was anticipating this charged conversation, so it was oddly anticlimactic lol. I'm happy they don't think I'm a horrible creep, but I've thought of myself this way for so long that now I don't know what I am.

She was quirky and complex (and human) and a great therapist and I miss her.* \n\n \\--\n\nI've mentioned on this sub that both my parents are therapists. And they're good ones, my dudes.

You're going to give your clients a complex. If Mister T didn't smile at me for a whole session I'd contemplate why he suddenly hated my guts for, like, 36 hours at least.\n\nDad: Well, most of my clients don't treat therapy like an improv comedy show like you and Mister T.\n\nMe: STILL.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nMe: Um... mom?

Us clients, we read into that stuff, mom.\n\nMom: Not everyone is like you, Selfless.\n\nMe: MOM. I'm an anxious person! People hire you because they are also anxious people! Your clients *are* like me!\n\n**Switching Back to In-Person is Weird for Them, Too**\n\nDad: First day back with clients in the office!\n\nMom: Remember, don't hug any women.\n\nDad: I have not done that for like... 15 years!\n\nMe: Dad... when people come in-person, they can see your pants.\n\nDad: I know...\n\nMe: Can... *you...* see your pants right now?\n\nMom: You painted in those yesterday! You can't wear those!\n\nDad: Shit! I'm already late!\n\nMe: Change your pants, dad.\\*\\*\n\n**They Don't Always Tell You Everything (But You Knew That)**\n\n*(Noticed that my mom pauses and sighs every time she reaches the bottom of our staircase.)*\n\nMe: Rough journey from the second floor again?\n\nMom: No... I'm just thinking about one of my clients. She's so depressed, and the stairs from her apartment seem so endless and daunting so she doesn't leave much. Every time I go down our stairs, I think about her, and I think, \"I did it. You can do it, too. I know it.\"\n\nMe: That's really sweet, mom.

She asked me three questions and then said, “well, we’re 11 minutes in, how do you feel?” And then she said that she felt uncomfortable and didn’t think we would be a good fit. \n\nGiven that she had only given the session 11 minutes, her decision to fire me could only be based in projections and unfounded judgements, since I had barely said anything after listening to her disclosures.\n\nWhat alarmed me was how highly unprofessional this is and defies the NASW code of ethics, value: service.\n\nI think if a therapist can’t give someone a full session to adjust due to their “discomfort” they’re in the wrong field, and knowing that people come in with attachment and abandonment issues, terminating suddenly and on the spot right off the bat is highly triggering and irresponsible. For example, if I’m working in a hospital and doing intake for someone having a psychotic episode, I’m going to feel some discomfort, and know that’s part of the job for which I received training. \n\nThese are just my thoughts though so really curious to hear any and all feedback. \n\nThank you!",

    "title": "Transference and why a relationship with your therapist will result in a full blown devastation. It’s what happened for me anyway.",
    "selftext": "TL;DR for people like me: Got a therapist. She became my adoptive Mom for about two years. I proceeded to become more sick. Ended up in mental hospital. Therapist proceeded to cover her ass and dumped mine. \n\nGosh, where to begin. \n\nI have suffered from major depression and high levels of anxiety since my early 20s. My mom passed away from brain cancer 4 years ago. Entering into my early 30s I started to really crater into depression. So I sought a therapist. \n\nI asked a friend for a therapist recommendation because she works in the field. I went and saw her recommendation and we immediately clicked. It was like we had known each other for years. I learned about transference from this subreddit and assigned what was happening as such. \n\nSeveral months into therapy my therapist was in the hospital for a surgery. She texted me at work and asked me to come see her in the hospital. So I went. The last time I had been to that hospital my mom was going through brain surgery so it was loaded for me. I stayed in the room with her and held her hand in the dark. She told me she loved me. I told her I loved her too. \n\nFrom that point forward she would refer to me as her soul daughter. We would skip therapy in the office and go to restaurants instead. She would write me notes expressing how much I meant to her. She would have me at her house, have dinner, drink, swim in the pool. I met her husband. I loved her back like my adoptive mom. We spoke everyday. Full blown relationship at this point. I asked her twice if we could forgo the therapy and just be friends. She said she knew her ethical boundaries well enough to be both to me. Sounded good to me. This went on for about a year and half. \n\nMeanwhile my mental state continued to deteriorate. My dr. kept switching my depression meds because none would work for me. I got to the point where I would hear loud voices and static constantly. Dr. consulted with my therapist and decided I could be bipolar and loaded me up on lithium and several more ssris. \n\nI started drinking one night to try and calm the noise. So I drank and watched Inception. If you know anything about that movie you know that was a terrible choice for me in that state but it was what Netflix recommended. So i began to think I needed to die to wake up. To stop the noise. I had a rope and a lot of meds from when my mom was sick as well as sleeping pills. Honestly I had been hoarding the meds and rope because I felt 0 interest in living. My plan was to take everything I had and hang myself. I didn’t account for how messed up my motor skills would get so quickly mixed with alcohol. I was unable to get the rope over the trellis on my deck. So in a way the pills kinda saved me. \n\nLong story longer I ended up in the mental hospital. When I got to call my therapist she was beside herself. Told me she never worried about a client more than she worried about me. \n\nWhen I got out I had actually been waiting for the results from my genetic test that I had done two weeks prior. Turns out I’m not bipolar and all my meds I was on were not at all compatible and where highlighted as could possibly cause adverse reactions. \n\nI also had to deal with the fallout. I knew at this point she was in full CYA mode. \n\nShe became adamant that I get a new therapist. I didn’t know what to do. My whole world crashed around me. I’m devastated. I complied because I love her. I went to new therapist and only managed three sessions. She didn’t want to touch me with a 10ft pole after hearing my story. So I got dumped again. \n\nThe whole experience has been soul crushing. I’m kinda at a loss. I guess all this to say for those of you who desire your therapist to be a friend, lover, parental figure etc outside of therapy I suppose my story can be an example of why in reality it’s a bad idea. I’m permanently scarred from it and I doubt I’ll ever seek professional counseling again. Way too painful and loaded for me now.",

    "selftext": "Today I wanted to talk with a therapist because I have been having trouble managing ADHD and stress. I told her sometimes I have intrusive suicidal thoughts but with no actual plan or intent. She then immediately just started saying she's calling the police and sending them to my house. I told her that I'm taking care of my little brother I don't want cops coming here and scaring him. She just kept saying she will call the police. I kept explaining to her that I have no actual desire to kill myself, no plan at all, but these thoughts pop in my head sometimes, like in an OCD kind of way. She just kept saying she would call the police. Eventually she called her supervisor because I was telling her not to send cops to my house, and she said she would make a deal that I could drive to the hospital with her on the phone. Now I'm in the emergency room against my will. Also, I had plans tonight with my friends that I now had to cancel, which I told her is further proof I'm not planning on killing myself. Is that normal procedure? Can she force me to go to the hospital against my will? Honestly, I'm never doing therapy again. What a terrible experience this was.\n\nEdit:\nSo they took me in the hospital. They took all of my possessions and clothes, locked me in a freezing cold room with a thin blanket and pillow, and left me there for 17 hours. I talked to the psychiatrist, told them everything that happened as it happened, and they released me. They did me like I'm fucking El Chapo. You couldn't do what they did to me in Guatanamo nowadays. No books, no TV, no one to talk to. After an hour of being locked in a nurse unlocked the door and said it was locked \"by accident.\" But I was still trapped down there just with access to the hallway now. They said I could not leave unless I spoke to a judge and the judge ordered my release. What the fuck.",

    "selftext": "I really hope someone on this sub can relate to this feeling of excitement, I've recently tried to explain it to a friend and I've mentioned it in my therapy a few times and it just feels like my friend and my therapist don't understand the significance. I think I could get my therapist to understand if I actually spend some time on it but it's not super important right now. \n\nI started therapy over 2 years ago, I'm in my mid 30s. Lot's of childhood issues. So therapy has been super slow, I dissociate a lot and we've worked on building trust and my emotional regulation skills etc. I think I'm only now able to trust my therapist and start talking about the trauma things more deeply. \n\nThat doesn't mean therapy hasn't helped me in the meantime. My life has changed SO MUCH in the past few years and it feels unexpected but so nice. The thing I'm excited about at the moment is such a basic thing which is why I feel like others might not appreciate the significance of it. \n\nBefore therapy life was one big blur. I dissociated my way through so much. I managed to hold a job and have friends but everything was chaos. I had 0 daily routines, everything I did to keep presentable and keep my house liveable and make sure I had meals was reactive. I felt hungry? I'd go figure out what to eat. Often there were no groceries in the fridge, no plan, no ideas. I felt like I needed a shower? I would. I did not shower in the morning or evening or according to any timetable. Things just happened as needed. From the outside looking in it wasn't so bad. But if you opened a drawer or would observe me for 24 hours, I'm sure people would be shocked at what they'd find. I was just, like many of us, in survival mode. \n\nAfter therapy started and I stopped the fulltime avoidance/dissociation thing, it's like some sort of extra energy appeared. And that energy helped me build some daily routines. It wasn't overnight, but more like incremental. I started walking daily. Then I started having 3 meals a day. Breakfast became a thing, whether hungry or not. Then cleaning/keeping things organized at home. Also in stages, from several 'deep cleans' and big attempts at organizing to eventually being able to keep things clean and organized throughout the week. To pick up that towel off the floor. To clean that table after it gets dirty. To fold the blanket and put it back on the couch. To hang my coat. To put my shoes in one place. Then to do my laundry every weekend, not waiting until there were no clothes left. And then the next step was to fold the laundry instead of chuck it in the closet. And now I fold it within 24hrs after washing it. I now have a bedtime. And my fitbit showed me recently I've been hitting my goal for hours of sleep a day on average for 6 months straight. When I now have a bad night, I have this deep sense of trust that I will be okay the next night. Which is so nice too. \n\nI feel silly summing it all up like this, but I so badly want someone to understand that it's been a huge change for me. We never talked much about this in therapy. But therapy became my base, and with that I somehow gained some breathing space. I never made a big plan to 'fix my life' and 'get organized' either, it just happened. I am a person who likes to be neat and organized, and it's been so difficult to deal with my entire life that I was just unable to create that kind of life for myself. That I lacked the ability even though I had the intense desire. \n\nI hope someone can tell me they relate, or have a similar story. I somehow badly need this to be understood. I guess maybe I should try to spend time on it in therapy because of that desire.\n\n*Edit: Thanks for the awards and all the nice responses, I am so glad that I posted. It shifted my perspective in feeling like nobody would really understand how big this feels. So thanks!*",

    "selftext": "Hi there,\n\nusing a throwaway because I don't want to give away my identity.\n\nSo I have been seeing my therapist on and off for about a year. So far I have been seeing her maybe once in a month or two but lately I have been asking her to work together with me on coming up with a more regular plan. Right now I am seeing her over video because I had to move back to my hometown temporarily, but intended to continue our in-person sessions in a few months based on how the pandemic situation progresses. When I began seeing her I was badly struggling in an abusive relationship which I have successfully got out of, so I'm really keen on spending some time being single and working on myself, my default habits and triggers. I also have past trauma that I need help navigating in my daily life. We have been speaking about this and I have been doing the homework she gives me. She has been great so far.\n\nIn the current divisive scenario of my country/the world at large, I am defined as a left-leaning liberal, even-though I think what better defines me is an artist-empath-egalitarian-intellectual but this identity isn't easy to unify around so... (This could be a whole other debate so leave that be.)\n\nWhat I definitely am NOT is a supporter of the far-right, which encourages fake news, religion-based violence and nationalist fascism. I happened to look up my therapist recently to check something about her and bam! I found her tweets. She is very active and has been re-tweeting what according to me is some pretty toxic stuff. Some of it is particularly toxic from a mental health perspective too. If it was just some centrist bullshit about seeing both sides, I'd still be annoyed but have less of an issue with it. However, she seems to be fully invested and  committed to what I consider to be truly terrible socio-political racist-sexist propaganda. If you're American, imagine being liberal and finding your sweet therapist is a fan of hate-politics against Mexicans and also an Anti-vaxxer.\n\nI am deeply disturbed by this and know that this will change how I view her in the future. I am also astonished and this has kind of been ringing distrust and poor judgement (already triggers after abuse) alarm bells for me. In our sessions, she is kind, graceful, has been the most non-judgmental of any therapist I've seen (I had to leave a two or three before because of moving cities or other reasons) and has been very understanding of my experiences related to sex, infidelity, drugs, self-harm, and so on, but the language of some of her retweets goes directly in the other direction. My (also liberal/artist) best friend recently decided to see a therapist due to some recent family events he was dealing with and I suggested her. He has been seeing her and he says she has helped him a lot too. I feel that if he knew this side of her, he might change his mind too.\n\nI am feeling cheated and unnerved. Please help. Should I speak to her about this or should I just find another person? I'm really disappointed because my mental health has been on a gradual upswing since I started seeing her and I feel like this is a bad dream.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTl;dr - therapist retweets many many very toxic far-right tweets and I'm taken by surprise and shocked because she has helped a lot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate 1:\n\nWow, I'll be honest. I did not expect these many responses. I really appreciate each one of you for taking the time to put forth your view on this tricky situation. From the sheer amount and variety  of comments, it became clear that I was not alone in feeling confused but also in feeling strongly. I had a session with her but couldn't gather the courage (also the session very quickly became about me, as sessions go, and I got in my feels). Btw, I'm not American, but that was just an easy example to give to (I'm guessing) the majority of people on here. I'm from a country divided on more religious lines and, while I'm neither hetero nor white, I'm definitely part of the religious majority, and I think that may have greatly mattered in this situation.\n\nSo I asked her over text as casually as I could \"hey doc, you on twitter?\" and she confirmed it was her and even said \"hey on twitter I'm not a therapist\", even though her bio clearly states this, and even started texting me details of some specific cases that she has been vocal about. All of this in response to just that one question. I really sensed some defensiveness but not sure. Anyway, I, thinking text is not the best place to do this, so I said I was sorry if bringing up her account crossed a line, and said that I'd like to bring it up in our next session. She responded positively and said she'd love to speak about this.\n\nI'm going through her re-tweets again (to those who called me out on this, its a very public twitter account with her full name and profession so I don't see why I shouldn't look at it) and I am feeling like this might be the end for us. I respect her right to her opinion. She also is not outright in the \"I hate X community\" tweets region. But she exclusively follows right-wing accounts and amplifies cases that are in the blue-lives-matter counter-movement category.\n\nI'm completely in opposition to the far-right in my country because it affects my life directly and negatively, but I also know that some of the nicest people I know support this movement simply because we don't have reliable sources of information in my country and not everyone has the privilege of education and the time to separate real news from fake. Religious indoctrination and a lack of resources is also at the root of things, and I know how some of them genuinely feel like they are under-attack at all times. So my shock was not about a nice person believing in this politics. I empathize with those people as much as I stand against them. In her case, though, she is so educated and well-traveled that she has access to a wide-variety of sources and facts just like me. And she's a therapist so I expected her to be able to see through the, imo, obviously manipulative and opportunist sources of info. Its bizarre how in this last session she was helping me understand the irrational fears that some people have which lead them to try and control you. Her feed indicates to me that not only has she bought into that propaganda but she prioritizes it over her mental health work by telling me that on twitter she is not a therapist but a nationalist. Heck, I work with children, and there are some posts with dark humor that I may love but that I will not post because I don't want any children or their parents, who might find my account, to feel unsafe around me or misunderstand my intentions.\n\nLike many of you pointed out, the session post-fact, while still helpful, made it difficult for me to take her seriously and I was analyzing everything she said. Whether or not I agree with her on other fronts, it's clear that this will be a roadblock if I were to go ahead with her in therapy. So, I'm going to give both of us the chance to hash it out in the next session and see if she will be able to offer me any insight that might make this transition easier for me.\n\nTbh, this is really difficult for me because I was relying on her sessions big time to help me go through life on a day to day basis. Its also difficult because having confidence in my point of view and in my reality is not my strong point at the moment. I have a history of being shamed and called dramatic/irrational for the beliefs that I hold, politically or otherwise, which leads to guilt and doubt, and this has been a big source of the abusive dynamics in the past. This incident has also made me feel hesitant about therapy altogether. I mean, clearly a therapist has no qualms putting aside what they really feel in order to tell you what they think you want/need to hear? Is that...honest? Am I being naive to even expect honesty from a therapist?\n\nfor those of you interested to know how it goes, I promise to make another update after the next session.",

    "selftext": "So this happened two days. I had a big discussion with a friend who convinced me to dig deeper into my traumas from racism and how my race is a huge part of my identity that I don't think enough about in therapy. Which is true, after a few months of therapy and many horrible events in the world, it never occurred to me to bring it up with my therapist.\n\nI was telling my therapist how despite how we were doing great work together, I was thinking about finding a different therapist that was POC and a woman because I felt that they could better understand my feelings and anxieties deeper through personal experience. I wouldn't have to explain myself so much.\n\nMy (white male) therapist completely freaked out on me and interrupted me \"So then I should write 'whites only' on my website? What about 'heterosexuals only'?\" I was stunned. I didn't know what to say. He then went on to talk about how he \"helps so many kinds of people and that he doesn't see sexuality, gender, or race when he talks to clients. What makes you think I can't help you as well as a female POC therapist? I grew up around people of color all my childhood.\" At some point I got the impression that he was indirectly saying how racist I was for insinuating that he couldn't help me cause he was white and male.\n\nSo then I try to give him context by saying how I feel like a foreigner in my own birth country despite growing up in said country, and how that's a very common feeling among second generation POC immigrants born and raised in white western countries. And he brings up an old mixed-race client who was born and raised in China and experienced the same feeling I have. \"What about her? Do you think she feels pain differently from you? Do you think a white woman in general experiences pain differently than you just cause she's white?\" I mean of course the feeling of pain is universal but not all of us experience pain in the same context or even a certain kind of pain. As I'm explaining how I think it's important for me to talk about my personal experiences with race and to consider it in my sessions, he asks \"What makes you think your personal experiences matter in therapy? And why talk about culture? All of us as individuals have our own culture. That's why we're all so different.\" I'm crying from anger at this point, and I'm telling him I'm pissed off at him and how he's not supporting my feelings or being open minded. Then he just straight up told me how I was projecting onto him cause he\"is trying to support me but also challenge my feelings. So it's me that needs to be openminded.\" Near the end of the session, he says that \"I'm young and impressionable\", that I shouldn't take what my friend and I discussed about so seriously.\n\nAt this point I'm so angry at him that I sat there for almost a quarter of my session and left the session early. I've already made my decision to leave and fire him the second he attacked me with his ego trip. I plan on ghosting him despite having two more sessions that I can't cancel or get a refund for. His reaction only confirms my suspicions about switching therapists. Luckily I'm already seeing another therapist who fits my needs better, but I'm shocked by that experience. I've never had so many micro aggressions thrown at me, let alone BY MY OWN THERAPIST.\n\nTl;dr: My white male therapist got really aggressive with me when I talked about my racial experiences, and he deflected and tried to gaslight me about my racial trauma.\n\nEdit: couple grammar mistakes\n\nI just want to say thank you all so much for your guys' support. It means a lot, especially when I was initially feeling doubtful whether he was right about certain things. But now I know for sure that he was absolutely wrong about everything!\n\nI do want to say that of course any therapist of any background can do great work with all kinds of clients. In fact my first ever therapist was white (woman this time-which probably helped make it easier to talk about very personal stuff), and she was a great start for scared little me who had never done therapy before. I hear a lot of great stories from my friends and their supportive therapists who are not from a similar background, but unfortunately I hear just as many bad ones as well :-( It really is all a matter of just finding the right therapist that fits your needs.",

    "selftext": "50s man with a warm, compassionate, reliable and boundaried psychiatrist. From 9/11 & military, I am terrified of flying and airports, planes, all of it.\n\nOur son is graduating college on Thursday so I flew from Argentina (where wife and I live) to the states. My wife needs to remain home for a family issue on her side so I am traveling solo.\n\nI purposely scheduled a session yesterday morning. (Flight was overnight last night). I told T that I wasn’t scared. But..I have been dreading flying because I keep thinking this trip could be the one where we crash. I had been feeling that way for the last month. But I have to be there for our son, so I’ve not let the dread take over.\n\nAll of a sudden I started sobbing, which I rarely do and I blurted out, “I just need you to know that if something happens to me, you have meant everything to me, and I will die about the best person I ever have been.”\n\nWe zoom and when I looked up she was choking tears back. I’ve never needed/wanted/thought about her emotions so it was a bit surprising to see her reaction. She’s never stoic as in a negative, she just stays pleasantly neutral when we talk about her and our work together.\n\nInstead of doing the expected…exploring/dissecting what I said to/about her, she just accepted it and didn’t downplay it. \n\nThen I realized I have been dreading this trip because my stepmom was hit by a car and died a month ago, exactly when I started worrying about dying in a plane crash. I had been so stunned and regretful I hadn’t said more to her when she was alive. T waited and then said she was thinking the death could be the root.\n\nAnd then my normally pleasantly unemotional T said, “send me a message that you arrived” which WHOA, we have clear “business only contact” boundaries. It means a lot to me that when she decided to bend the rules, and ask-allow such a contact, it was for absolutely the right situation. I need to prove to her but of course myself, that I did arrive after all.\n\nI’m sitting here in Houston waiting for the next flight to our son and replaying the session. I appreciate her so much.\n\nAnd advice to all of you: call someone you haven’t talked to in awhile. I never thought a loved one would be killed by a truck going across the street from church choir practice.",

Last week therapist was suddenly acting different, belittling me and shaming me as self-pitying when I talked about the feelings I was having after suddenly losing my 11 yr old kitty who was like a child to me and had JUST died  the week before. I left the session feeling ashamed, confused, and shut down. \n\nThe next day she runs my debit card for the $45 copay for the session but charges me $4,500! Yeah. Instead of invoicing her clients, she asks clients to give her a card number on file to run payments. Her careless mistake wiped out my entire checking account balance. The error was caught the next day, and she did  initiate a refund through Square, but my bank says the refund credit not be processed into my account until Friday at earliest. Meanwhile auto bill payments keep hitting my overdrawn account plus  $400 in overdraft charges just so far. I'm at the mercy of this refund process, and this woman has been snotty toward me about. I mean anyone can make a mistake, but good lord  when I explained to her the snowball effect this delay in being reimbursed is having on my account and life, she had the hubris to shade blame at me for not immediately  catching her careless mistake. (I get a text notification from Square that there's a receipt, but I was at work when I got it the next day and hadn't looked at it yet.) Meanwhile I'm a single widow stuck without access to my own dang money for food or gas or emergencies until Friday at earliest. \n\nIt may not have been intentional, but  her careless mistake took away my safety and security of having money in my checking account and sense of control over my survival needs. On top of it, she's shown little compassion or grace about it and a snotty attitude. Until last week I deeply trusted her. I feel violated.",

If they say “I will do my best to maintain this relationship, work through any conflicts, and give you as much notice as I can if I need to terminate therapy” you are dealing with someone who has come to terms with their own limits.",

How dare you listen without judgement no matter what I say and no matter how long it takes me to say it. How dare you be so funny and wise and stubborn. So incredibly stubborn. \n\nYou have seen the worst of me, heard my darkest secrets, and comforted me through my biggest regrets, but nothing seems to faze you. Everybody leaves. Why do you insist on being different? Lord knows I’ve tried desperately to push you away, testing your patience and resolve week after week, resisting your efforts, yelling at you, accusing you of ulterior motives, and sometimes just shutting you out entirely. Yet you keep showing up. \n\nYou keep making time. You keep holding space. You keep pushing back against toxic self-talk and beliefs that have become so powerful and engrained over the years that sometimes it seems like you’re arguing with an entirely different person inside of me. That person hates me. There are days that person wants me to die. Although I don’t always have the strength to stand up to myself, you’ve never once backed down. And when that side of me settles and the anxiety creeps back in, you don’t back down from that either. \n\nThe panic is so real and the fear of abandonment grips my chest like a vice until I can barely do more than listen to the sound of your voice. Unhinged, I collapse. You embrace my tears, shrug off my apologies, and say simply, “I’m not leaving. Our work together matters. You deserve to be cared about.” The compassion is like acid on my skin but you tell me to sit with it. I do because I trust you. You keep watch to make sure it’s never too much. \n\nI never thought I’d feel so safe and seen with someone. I never thought I’d share the things I’ve shared. Whatever you’re paid, it isn’t enough for all the ways you’ve saved me and certainly not enough for all ways you’re teaching me to save myself. My only hope is that you truly do love your work the way you say you do. I hope that the ever-present smile on your face isn’t just for show.

    "title": "Some unsolicited advice from a person who has been to countless therapists over the last decade.",
    "selftext": "I’ve seen countless therapists over the last decade. I’ve been hospitalized in psych wards, in locked down psychiatric hospitals, put in inpatient programs, done extensive outpatient programs. Seen tons of specialists. Just, have a ton of experience with this field as a patient with a complicated case. So, here are some things that I have learned over my years.\n\n1. Call your insurance and get a list of covered therapists in your area and be willing to drive a reasonable distance (this expands your initial search). Start making phone calls immediately. First question should always be - are you taking new patients? Second question - when is your soonest availability? Third question - how many times a month do you typically see your clients? And lastly, but most importantly, what specialty (if any) do you practice? Also, make clear any absolutes they need to know (specifically things like being against taking meds - therapists can’t prescribe them but they might push you to get some from a psychiatrist). \n\nWait about a week to see who calls back or who you talk to and make a note in your phone about each one. After you get your responses, then you choose one to make an appointment with.\n\n2. What is your initial impression of this person? What do you like about them and what don’t you like about them? I always say go to at least 3 sessions before choosing to switch unless something happens that’s an absolute deal breaker for you.\n\n3. **IT IS OKAY TO DECIDE SOMEONE IS NOT THE THERAPIST FOR YOU AND YOU DO NOT OWE THEM AN EXPLANATION AS TO WHY YOU ARE LEAVING THEIR CARE.** Some people get lucky and find a good therapist they connect with fairly early on. Most of us don’t and it can take weeks, months, and even years to find someone you truly like. But, once you do, they’re literally worth their weight in gold. Be patient. \n\n4. I personally believe that the first few sessions should be more about the therapist getting to know you, your upbringing, your life. All of these things directly effect how you react to certain things or why you do certain things. Therapists who go out of their way to get to know you first are the ones who are going to give you advice that is more specifically tailored to your specific situation and life.\n\n5. If you take anxiety medication, do not take it before an appointment even if that means you have a panic attack. If you take it beforehand, it makes you incapable of experiencing the session which basically means you’ve wasted time. You need to feel. \n\n6. Do the exercises they assign even if you think it won’t work or it’s stupid. Any coping mechanism that you can try means one more hope of finding better ways of handling situations and emotions. Also, do some research, talk to friends, post on forums. See what other people do and don’t be afraid to find your own coping mechanisms. The more coping mechanisms you have in your Arsenal, the better off you are. \n\n7. Feel free to bring a comfort item with you. It’s not childish. It’s not looked down upon. It isn’t silly. It’s a good tool to help through tough sessions.\n\n8. Have an ultimate goal in mind going in. What do you really hope to achieve with therapy? And share that with the therapist. Having an ultimate goal is good to have. It could even be just to feel comfortable enough with someone to talk about the things you don’t talk about with others. \n\n9. Don’t be afraid to be honest and remember that there are very very few reasons that any medical professional could have you committed and that is if you tell them that you are actively suicidal or homicidal and have a plan. \n\n10. Keep a journal of things that happen between sessions you wanna talk to your therapist about.\n\nSo, anyways, those are just some tips off the top of my head. I hope they help!",

Now I feel weirdly comforted by it which throws me off, but is nice. I guess I’m glad I went back, even though it was hard.

However, it seems valuable to do so.   But at this stage, I'm worried that every session is just going to be me crying endlessly about the past. That also doesn't sound appealing or helpful.

She has helped me significantly with religious trauma from an evangelical group I was apart of most of my life.  After the election I was distraught and dealing with some triggers. Specifically with the evangelical group saying they will take power ect… \n\n  In my session the other day; I stated I didn’t want to talk about the candidates however the after math and some of the things I’m seeing and hearing that has been extremely overwhelming with hate and Christian nationalism (after getting to know her the past few years I did assume we voted the same way). I stated I want to work with what specifically was causing the anxiety trigger in that moment and not the obvious issues with Trump. She said the correct candidate has won. \n\n I was extremely shocked and didn’t say anything. She said it sounds like I’m worried about freedom and he protects freedom. She said Kamala would have taken away all freedoms and Biden has been the one who has censored people. I was so taken a back and in that moment had no idea what to say. She continued that my fears are “unrealistic” and that Trump does not cater or speak to any religious groups. She told me he was president before and I was fine, but if I’m concerned there are blue states I could go to. \n\n  I’m at a loss for what to do. I left the session more distraught than when I started it. I can’t really put into words what I was feeling other than sad. I also want to stress that I have formed a really deep connection with my Therapist and she has had such a positive impact on my life. Should I try to forget this session? It’s only one bad session out of four years worth of good ones. Or do I need to move to another therapist? I feel like my concerns were minimized and I do feel extremely uncomfortable that she was defending an abuser and felon. I am concerned that I cannot really talk about certain fears, concerns, or triggers now knowing her personal beliefs. Any advice for this would be so appreciated. Thankyou💙",

    "selftext": "I was super anxious walking into my last session. The session before, my therapist acted in a way that made me feel belittled. It felt like he was really pushing his authority on me, and I have a problem with that at the best of times. From him, it ticked me off because I thought he was better than that. We are early enough into this therapy relationship I considered walking if the session went poorly. \n\nOur session was online this week. I had typed up an angry rant from  before when I was in my feels. Even though I wasn't as angry anymore and moreso wanted to collaborate on how to move forward from this, it was still important to me to show him my anger. So I kept the angry rant up as motivation lol. I suck at confrontation, but I really wanted to try.\n\nSo I immediately start the session about how angry last session felt for me. And my T tells me if I didn't bring it up, he was going to. And he just full-on apologizes for everything, how he was acting patronizing, how he brought in feelings from a prior client session and none of that was on me. He said he was thinking about our session \"all week.\" And he apologized for acting so patronizing.\n\nI'm a shit person to apologize to, I think. I'm hard-pressed to say \"I forgive you\" since those words are often used against me in the past (like it becomes a green flag for the other person to continue to hurt me in the same way). So I tend to wait to see if the apology is sincere (through actions, not words) before I forgive.\n\nALL OF THAT TO SAY: Once it felt like the confrontation was over, my anger was heard and valued, and he apologized, my mind just totally blanked out. It didn't know where to go. It was just empty space of mild perplexity between my ears. So I told him I was feeling wordless and was gonna play my piano (since my keyboard is right by my computer). So I played a little improv, and it sounded sad to me, so I started talking about that. \n\nMy T told me I was always welcome to play the piano during our online sessions (he said my playing was \"lovely,\" and I wish I could take the compliment but it just goes to blank air lol). And at the end of session, HE ASKS IF HE CAN PLAY SOMETHING FOR ME. AND HE PULLS OUT HIS FLUTE. And like, y'all, oh my gosh, I could viscerally feel his well-wishes for me through his breath. I could feel his apology, his recognition of harm, his gentleness. I could hear how delicately and intentionally he wanted to approach me through his vibrato and the way the notes hung in the air then softly tapered. It was like, because his very breath became musicalized, I could hear how he was breathing certain things for me. I just heard him in a completely different way *because* it was without words.\n\nAnyway holy shit therapy is fucking weird.",

She didn't preach to me about her privilege and how woke she was, but I could understand she truly supported me and was open to my anger and validated it.

This post absolutely isn’t therapist-bashing; in fact I would love to be a therapist one day and have the utmost respect for my current therapist who I feel totally safe with. \n\nTW SA/therapy abuse \n\nWhen I was 18 I was inpatient for mental health. I thought my therapist was amazing - I experienced a lot of transference in the sense that I thought about him a lot and loved the sense of safety he provided, to the point that I was pretty obsessed with him. Without going into too much detail boundaries were gradually crossed until eventually we ended up in a relationship. It was reported and he lost his job but the relationship continued. He was double my age, and once he lost his job he relapsed with drug addiction. I was very vulnerable which I can now see, but of course at the time I believed I was walking into it with my eyes open. Over time this relationship became extremely abusive, including violence and SA. I tried to escape multiple times and attempted suicide. Eventually, after a few years, I moved abroad and haven’t seen him since. I started therapy recently for another issue but of course we’ve actually spent the majority of the time exploring this (lol not sure how I thought I could get away with that!)\n\nI thought a lot about whether to post this. I joined Reddit to get insight into what to expect from (healthy!) therapy/to find people to relate to finding the process dysregulating at times. I didn’t expect to share my past experience but after reading a lot about transference/counter transference I’ve understood more why I was so vulnerable at that point in my life, and also wanted to warn people that even though they might fantasise about acting on these obsessions, it really doesn’t end well. If there’s a therapist who is willing to cross ethical boundaries, then you have no idea how far they’d be willing to go/how much they’ll take advantage of your vulnerability. Therefore, those you who are frustrated by your therapists professionalism or strict boundaries, please recognise that this is in itself an act of love and something to cherish in the therapeutic relationship. I am finding it hard with my new therapist, because I trust her and feel safe with her and that in itself is scary and I’m finding myself thinking about her probably too much - but I’m hoping that this will be a healing process in which I learn to experience healthy boundaries without exploitation. \n\nEdit to add: Thank you so much for the kind messages I’ve been receiving. I really didn’t anticipate this reaction and it’s really touching. I’ve still got a long way to go with my healing but I wanted to share my story as a warning about boundary crossing when taken to the extreme. Thank you again ",

    "selftext": "I’ve been seeing my therapist for three months. I got a referral to him from my PCP to help to deal with PTSD from past abusive relationships, and for the first couple of months he was great, and seemed helpful. \n\nIt became obvious that there was a mutual attraction, and I read a lot about transference and countertransference to see how normal it was. I assumed it was just that, and nothing was wrong with it. \n\nOver the last month, therapy sessions turned into something more akin to normal talking and light flirting. Then we started texting. \n\nI first messaged him the night of the SCOTUS ruling, because I was having a hard time processing my own emotions over all of it, and we texted back and forth for about an hour or so. \n\nTexting here and there became normal, and didn’t seem strange. About a week ago, he texted me in the middle of the afternoon over something random I had mentioned, and we proceeded to text back and forth for seven hours. \n\nA couple nights later, we texted again for hours— until around 11pm. Personal stuff. Not therapy. At the very end, he said he thought we might be crossing the ethical doctor/patient boundaries, and he wasn’t sure what to do. He said he was confused by it and that I was just “easy to talk to” and “it got away” from him. I mentioned transference and countertransference, and I didn’t know what to do either, because I didn’t want to see another therapist. He asked if he felt like I was experiencing transference, which felt odd in the way he phrased it, so I said I didn’t think so, and he said that we could definitely still work through this and just to be open with our feelings so that he could be helpful to me. We said goodnight, and I wasn’t expecting to hear anything from him until our session this week. \n\nThe very next night, however, he texted me, “Hi” just after 8:30pm. The word “hi” always sounds ominous to me, so I assumed he was saying he didn’t think continuing therapy together was a good thing— and when I asked if that was what was up, he laughed and said he was just saying hi, and asked how I was doing. He told me about his day. We texted for another three hours, and this time felt much more intimate in terms of topics of conversation. Nothing outwardly sexual, but it was beginning to feel heavy, and obsessive on both ends. \n\nIt’s been fucking with my head, because I can’t help but feel as though I have feelings for him, even though what he’s doing is inappropriate, and I am very aware of that. I’ve been in relationships with abusive guys, and guys who gaslighted me constantly. He is aware of all of this. He convinced me to cut off ties with an ex who, yes, I should have cut off ties with a while ago, but he was adamant in pushing me to do it within a set period of time, because “he was an asshole”. \n\nI messaged him this past Saturday to tell him that I was feeling fucked up over this all. He snapped back that he was dealing with a family issue, and that he had helped me when I was upset over the SCOTUS ordeal, but outside of that I couldn’t be messaging him outside of work hours, because it’s crossing lines, and he doesn’t have his phone all the time, so not to expect anything, and not to message him again. He said he’d help me find a new therapist at our next appointment. \n\nI have our entire text history saved. I’m in shock how callous his reaction was, and how far from the truth it is. It’s a huge mindfuck to me, because he’s been the one initiating almost all of the contact— and perpetuating it. He’s acting as though only one conversation occurred, and he was only doing it to help in an acute stressful situation. \n\nSo, I’m not seeing him again. I don’t even want to start therapy again with anyone, because this has messed up my ability to trust even more. \n\nI don’t know what else to do. I don’t want to fuck up his life. He’s married and has kids and other patients, and I don’t want to hurt them or throw their lives into chaos.",

Even prior to that I’ve struggled. EMDR makes me freeze up, I have serious trust issues and walls go up quickly.. and one specific memory I can’t bring myself to put into words. The images are in my head but I can’t talk about it. \n\nMy therapist had me write it out, and we had a good session today talking about how it made me feel, without sharing the specifics. \n\nWith fifteen minutes left, I blurted out, “Can I share something with you?” And of course she said yes. I was super nervous, but I asked, “Can I give you my old address and have you pull it up on google street view so you can see where my trauma happened? Is that okay? Is that stupid?” \n\nIt wasn’t stupid. I am so glad I finally asked her to do this. I’ve wanted to for so long. I’ve wanted her to see it for so long. I can’t even put into words how freeing it was for me. Just knowing that she was seeing the same things I was and that now she has the same image in her head that I do. Someone else is holding this with me. It’s so powerful. \n\nAt the end of session she thanked me multiple times and said this was the first time she’d ever had a client share in that way with her, and how impactful it was for her. I emailed her after and told her I want to start there again next session, and I think we will be using this moving forward. \n\nFor those that struggle with speaking it out like I do, I wanted to share - maybe it will help someone else. \n\nLots of love. ❤️",

I asked, “Was that the dog?” right as the ever-specific sound of a pet puking on the floor had our full attention. “Is she ok?”\n\nT raised one finger, “I’d better check,” and left the camera’s view with me nodding approval. Off camera, I can hear her say with all the love for her pup, **“You did good. Yes, you did good. You’re exactly right; you needed to get rid of that didn’t you? You’re exactly right; you needed to get rid of that didn’t you? You did so good.”**\n\nOh my heart. I know it was the dog in need, but she’s been just as gentle, affirming, and nurturing to me when I’ve been miserable and sick with grief, just in her therapeutic way of letting me self-soothe instead of her doing all the work for me. Hearing her be so kind and supportive to her ill pet felt like how she’s encouraged me to let all the grief and repressed stuff purge from me in our time together.\n\nThat it’s all good and I did good and I needed to get rid of that, didn’t I? And I wasn’t yelled at for making a mess or being snotty and gross while crying - just supported and helped while I got rid of the bad stuff.\n\nWe joked a bit about how nice it is to be there for the dog when it’s happening to keep an eye on their health, but also so you don’t unexpectedly step in hot vom later. The metaphor continues! I need to express and exercise things from me and then address it and make sure to clean if needed because letting that stuff fester or neglecting it only makes it worse.\n\nIt was a piece of paper and some grass. Pup must have eaten the paper and noticed the indigestion, so doggo ate grass to induce vomiting. Actually getting that nasty stuff up was taking care of herself! Ack! It’s incredibly affirming to hear that even the nasty bits can be self-care. \n\nI hope you aren’t rolling your eyes at how much I read into this turn of events. It’s grounding to find life in bodily functions. I’m curious what you think and if you have any stories about inadvertent lessons learned in therapy.",

I also happen to have a psychiatrist who is a white gay man. Today in passing, I joked about how I was privileged enough to have a team of white gays to help me with my mental health. My therapist did not take this well and explained I could not bring his race or sexuality into our sessions. He also mentioned that in a previous session, he felt disrespected when I (again jokingly) referred to myself as an f-word for liking a certain female singer too much. He suggested I was engaging in toxic masculinity by being provocative and \"laughing off\" things. I kinda felt scolded.\n\nI completely understand therapists have boundaries patients should respect. But I am concerned my therapist might be a little too sensitive/serious for my liking. In my view, I might have been a little informal, but was definitely not trying to be offensive. Is this a matter of fit or was I plain inappropriate?\n\nMore fundamentally, I am concerned my therapist might not get that levity helps me deal with uncomfortable or traumatic topics. Moreover, our respective positionalities shape our therapeutic relationship, and I think my bringing this up should have opened up a discussion...\n\nIs this something I should bring up during a next session, or should I just move on?",

    "selftext": "Last Tuesday was supposed to be my first appointment with a new therapist. 30 minutes before my appointment she emailed me and said she had an accident while taking her kids to school and that she had to reschedule for a different date. I told her that it was completely fine and that I understood. She later emailed me that the only appointment she had was a week out and so we rescheduled for that day. Well last night I saw that I had a fraud charge on my credit card over $250 and I have been trying to dispute it. I emailed her this morning that I wouldn’t be able to make it this morning because $175 of that money was supposed to go to the first session. She said that we could reschedule but she does do cancellation fees. I never looked at her policy about cancellation fees because I never thought I would miss an appointment. I asked her if she would be willing at all to call it “even” for last week and it would never happen again. She said that it was her policy and that she would take $50 off my next appointment instead. I asked her how much the late fee was and I had no idea it would be the full $175. I kept explaining the situation and asked her if she could squeeze me in anywhere at all so the $175 wouldn’t be a complete waste but she said that she couldn’t. Now I’m completely out of the $175. She asked if I wanted to reschedule for next week but honestly this left a bad taste in my mouth. I understand it’s policy but when she had to cancel 30 minutes before my appointment there was complete understanding but when I cancel it’s $175. Should I see her next week or find a new therapist? Thank you\n\nUPDATE: She refunded the full $175\n\nEmail is as followed-\n\nME : “Ok. I think after this I’m going to find someone else. I just don’t think it’s right that there seems like there’s no flexibility. When you had your emergency you cancelled 30 minutes before our appointment and I was completely understanding. I understand there could have been someone else in my spot but I missed an hour of work last week as well for our last appointment. But when something happens to a client it’s i’m sorry about your emergency but here’s a $175 cancellation fee. Yesterday someone ran a fraudulent charge for over $250. Money I was saving so I could specifically see you. Now I’m out of $425 as of now. But I lost trust so I know there’s no point in moving forward. Thank you for all of your time that you have given me.”\n\n\nTHERAPIST: “I just refunded the full $175. It will be 5-10 days to reappear on your card. \nIf you would have been in a car accident or in the emergency room, etc (true emergencies) I would absolutely understand and not charge a late fee. Most professional counselors, doctors, etc have a similar policy.”\nI wish you the best of luck.",

But with however long covid lasts that might be next on my agenda.” I laughed and told her I just couldn’t skip the opportunity to be an asshole and flip the table.\n\nShe was a really good sport about it and I’m super glad to have found her.

    "selftext": "I spoke to my therapist last night about how frustrating it is that every time I go through a life change of any sort or something bad happens or I face some kind of inconvenience, I tend to either enter a state of panic, am unable to stop my mind racing and make quick decisions and don't think rationally OR I slip into a state of feeling too overwhelmed by everything and I feel numb and even small tasks seem insurmountable. \n\nWe have spoken about The Window of Tolerance before but she brought it up again last night and it really resonated with me this time. For anyone who doesn't know, it is the idea that everyone has a window of tolerance where they are are able to be generally settled, cope well with day-to-day stresses, effectively self-regulate and think rationally. For a lot of people that window is quite large but for people who have experienced trauma, it can be reduced quite considerably. \n\nEveryone has experiences which push them out of their window of tolerance into either *hyper-arousal* (aka fight/flight - anxiety, panic, trying to do everything at once, racing thoughts, hypervigilence etc) or *hypo-arousal* (aka freeze/fawn - depression, numbness, emptiness etc). It's a response to threat and can be a protective mechanism for many people but people who have experienced trauma may be forced to operate outwith the window regularly which can be very difficult to manage.\n\nWe identified last night that my window of tolerance is quite small due to a lot of things that have happened and this makes it hard for me to self-regulate and manage change and day-to-day stress effectively. I wonder if this resonates with some of you? \n\nI hope this post is interesting or relatable to some of you. I would love to hear any thoughts on this or experiences etc if anyone wanted to 😊 I really enjoyed having this conversation with my therapist because it helped me understand some of my behaviour and responses a little better.",

    "title": "Therapy Anniversary",
    "selftext": "\nToday is my therapy anniversary! \n\nTLDR: therapy works. \n\nHere’s my story:\n\nThree years ago today I sat down in Dan’s office with zero hope that he could actually help me. I had been to three others before him and while each of those three people were well respected in their circles, they were all bullshit to me. \n\nThe first gave me surveys measuring my life’s stressors and told me to pray. I’m an atheist, but he wouldn’t have known that because he never asked. \n\nThe second was a psychiatrist. He pumped me full of Zoloft, which didn’t work; Gabapentin, which didn’t work; and eventually Ritalin-type drugs, which kept me wired and energetic, but stopped me from eating and sleeping. Then he gave me sleeping pills. I had anxiety and now I was taking pills to go to sleep and pills to wake up and pills to keep me working. My teeth were breaking because I was grinding them so much on the uppers. I dropped down to under 100 pounds, my skin was waxy and my face sunken in. I looked sick. Because I was sick. \n\nThe third was a CBT lady who gave me a worksheet and told me I was being too negative. “Look at me!” I screamed internally. “I’m wasting away!” \n\nI was having anxiety attacks every single day. I was so, so desperate for relief from the horribleness of this mental and physical decay I was experiencing. I considered throwing myself in front of a car so that I could lay still in the hospital for a while, just to be free of any expectation that I should function. \n\nSo when I landed in a chair across from Dan, I was ready to be disregarded and disappointed. I was ready to be insulted and misunderstood. I was ready. But he was different. \n\nHe and I sat together and mapped out my huge family. I gave him little snippets of information about each person as we drew their branch in my family tree. My mom was a drug addict who didn’t really feed us when we were small. My dad wasn’t around. My brother is violent and in prison. My sister is a criminal. Etc. \n\nI expressed to him my hopelessness, and I wasn’t very nice about it. And then he told me something I had never considered. He said, “Your anxiety comes from unresolved trauma in your past.”\n\nIt seems so obvious now. But three years ago, with those words, I felt something open up inside of me. I looked at this weird little bald man across from me and felt the truth of it all and I knew I could change. \n\nIt took months for me to fully trust him. But he stayed with me. He sat with me. He listened to me. He focused on me. He answered when I needed him. He was flexible. He was smart. He made me feel safe. \n\nFor a long time I lived appointment to appointment. I went twice a week and as soon as I closed the door behind me, I was counting down the time until I could be safe in that room again. \n\nI disclosed things that would make me cringe for days afterwards. There was a time when I was having PTSD-like nightmares and my body wouldn’t let me sleep for days at a time. As soon as I would doze off, I was jolted awake with a shock of electricity. I felt like a walking open wound. It was horrible. But I understood that this pain was progress because he had told me this might happen. He always told me the truth. And I believed he wouldn’t leave me bleeding and festering. So we kept at it. We worked together. \n\nHe would show up when he promised and we would connect again and I swear to you it was like cold water on a fire somewhere in my core. I could literally feel myself healing bit by bit. \n\nIt was the winter solstice of 2017 — the day I met Dan — the darkest day of the year. And as it goes, every day after that has been a little brighter, a little warmer. \n\nLittle by little, I started to sleep. I handed over to him all of my pills. I started to eat better and gain weight. I got a bike and started exercising again. I weathered family drama with new integrity and self assuredness. I got married. I had a baby. And I’m a GOOD parent. \n\nI am genuinely a happy, healthy human being now. I protect my peace, I embrace my past, and I cherish my therapeutic relationship more than I can fully convey. Therapy with Dan has honestly saved my life.\n\nI have a session scheduled with him in a couple hours and I hope to be able to tell him what I’ve told you here. \n\nTherapy works, my friends. The fit between you and your therapist matters more than anything. If you haven’t found the right one yet, keep looking. It’s worth it.\n\n\nEdit: Thank you to everyone who commented and awarded this post! It means a lot that you took the time to read about my experience. \n\nEdit 2: I had my session with Dan and it was beautiful. We spent time looking back at the progress I’ve made and the success that has come from our time together. I told him some very specific ways that he’s helped me over the years. He told me that there’s no place he’d rather be than right here doing this work with me. I could tell he meant it and I’m just soaring. \n\nI sincerely hope each of you find your Dan.",

I look forward to being able to have an appointment so that I can unload and process the events of that week or two. However, she cancels at the last minute quite often.

    "selftext": "I see people bringing up the same questions over and over on this sub, and I assume it's because therapists generally don't tell clients what to expect. I’ve seen many therapists over the decades and they’ve usually just started doing the work. \n\nHere’s my starter list of what I wish my therapists would tell me when I start working with them, or at least along the way as soon as an issue arises: \n\n* I’m the client, so this therapy will be what I want it to be. I don’t need their permission to ask for something to be done differently.\n* They are open to feedback any time and are sometimes going to ask me for feedback directly, and will change their approach in response.\n* Sometimes a rupture in therapeutic relationships happens and they’ll work with me on resolving that. \n* Some people can feel very attached to their therapist, or think about therapy a lot, and some don’t, but either is normal and we can discuss it if it bothers me.\n* There are different ways we can structure our sessions or the therapy overall, and here are some examples. \n* If I'm having any uncomfortable feelings about therapy, they want to hear about it and will respond with interest and without judgement. \n* They will go at my pace and not push me to talk about upsetting topics before I’m ready. \n* What their self-disclosure style is and why they would choose to self-disclose, and make it clear that hearing personal things about them is opt in, not opt out. \n* We will have clear goals and check on them periodically. \n* What their boundaries are about communication outside of sessions.\n* Whether it’s okay to ask for extra sessions and to not feel uncomfortable asking. \n* What it means when they say this is a safe space.\n* A clear explanation of the cost and billing policies, whether they make up appointments if they have to cancel, and the length of time of the sessions.\n\nI'd love your feedback on whether your therapists have volunteered this information, especially up front, and if there are things you would add.",

    "title": "Day 1 Update After My Therapist Died",
    "selftext": "Today was hard. I am on the roller coast of grief (it is not a cycle). I've fluctuated between periods of painful depression and denial mostly. When I haven't been weeping or managing to distract myself, it has just felt incredibly surreal. I want to wake up from a bad dream or find out this is some horrible joke or mistake. A few times I have slipped away into mild dissociation. I've only experienced the deaths of my grandparents, which were expected when they happened. I've nearly lost my sister to suicide a few times but so gratefully it was not successful and she was able to recover. I've experienced a lot of grief over the past few years from debilitating accidents that have taken a lot of my previous life away, but I've never felt grief like this. I have tried to stay away from bargaining because I know there is nothing I can do, but I honestly wish I could.\n\nI listened to the mindfulness meditations he made me today. I didn't think I'd be able to so soon, and at first it was really painful, but then it felt very soothing to hear his voice again. I found out he had a professional social media account from his website and I scrolled through his posts. I learned he had a hedgehog named Garnet and he painted to express his inner turmoil. He had some really tough childhood traumas that he mentioned too. He was dedicated to learning as much as he could about trauma so he could help others. It really reaffirmed what a truly good human being he was.\n\nI bought a tiny sand-filled octopus toy from the store near by. Maybe you remember the sand filled lizards and frogs toys from the 90s? It's one of those. It reminds me of my little self, which my therapist taught me to love and embrace and care for. The octopus toy feels soothing to hold. The fabric is silky with rainbow colours and metallic spots. The tentacles fit nicely amongst my fingers to fidget with and keep my hands busy. I named him after my therapist. In the moments when it feels so surreal, the octopus reminds me of the reality. It hurts, it truly does, but it is keeping me grounded in the real world.\n\nReading all of the responses to my original post have been very comforting and helpful too. I've got some good ideas of ways to help me cope. I appreciate everyone who has read my story, especially those who have shared their experiences and kind words with me.",

It can’t be easy listening to trauma stories and seeing our struggles and dissociations while we tell our stories. But you do, and it helps me.\n\nI started therapy because I had a disastrous dating life and I didn’t know why. All I knew was that I had issues being vulnerable with men. I chose a male psych specifically to help me overcome this. He helped me realize that the “normal stupid kid stuff” I experienced from age 5-12 was not consensual and caused me harm. And the “bad experience” I had in my 20s meets the legal definition of rape. Learning to be vulnerable with a man has been really great. It’s taken me three months and two exposure therapy sessions to go from being afraid of him, to nervous about him, to anxious about him, but I think my next appointment I’ll just feel normally about him. \n\nHaving a man validate that I’m not blowing this out of proportion and that what happened wasn’t my fault has been really healing. Learning to trust him has been really healing. When I first started therapy I read lots of posts by therapists on here that showed me that they do care about their clients and factored in to my decision to tell my psych the parts of my experience I felt the most shame over. I didn’t believe his compassion for me at first but I think I do now.\n\nThanks for being who you are and helping so many of us. I know some people are jaded and are struggling and maybe hate therapy. I’m one of the lucky ones being helped and I’m feeling really thankful.

    "title": "I have made a checklist to help me find the right therapist",
    "selftext": "Hi everybody! I've seen 7 therapists over the course of the last year. 2 were great for me, but had to refer me out for reasons beyond anyone's control. All the others.... well, some of them were just not the right fit but there was nothing wrong with them, and 2 of them downright re-traumatized me. One was just unprofessional and sloppy, which I did not appreciate. So, as you might imagine, I am really tired of continuing to pay more and more and more money just to have fruitless first sessions or first few sessions which I leave feeling unheard, invalidated, confused, saddened or infuriated. So, to avoid that, I have compiled 3 checklists: a phone checklist for our first conversation, a 1st session checklist, and a first 3 sessions checklist. Of course, if sombody doesn't score well on the phone one, there will be no first session, and so on. So here they are, they are strictly tailored to me and my needs, but in case anyone finds it interesting:\n\nPhone checklist:\n\n1. Do they sound warm?\n\n2. Do they sound \"human\"? (as opposed to \"strictly clinical\")\n\n3. Do they sound enthusiastic?\n\n4. Do they sound caring?\n\n5. Do they sound accepting? (As opposed to stressed, anxious, annoyed etc)\n\n6. Do they sound calm and centered?\n\n7. Do they care why I want therapy, or do they jump straight to booking the first appt?\n\n8. Do they say anything weird? (I included this because one T I saw self-disclosed something about herself over the phone during the first phone convo, which in retrospect should have been a red flag)\n\n\n1st session checklist:\n\n1. Do I feel like I can be myself?\n\n2. Is there space for me to say what I want to? (Or is the T interrupting me, telling me to talk about other stuff, formulating theories about me right off the bat etc)\n\n3. Do I feel rushed? (Check if no)\n4. Do they have reasonable boundaries? (cancellation policy, no phone calls between sessions, stuff like that)\n\n5. Are they \"woke\" in terms of issues around sexism and sex in particular (this one is important to me, I was re-traumatized by 2 sexist therapists who basically shamed me for reclaiming my sexuality after past abuse)\n\n\n3rd session checklist:\n\n1. Can I be myself?\n\n2. Do I feel validated?\n\n3. Is there space for me?\n\n4. Am I #1? (Or are they, or someone in my story, or the institution of family above all else)\n\n5. Have goals been discussed?\n\n6. Have I been challenged? (Though this maybe should be on the 10th session checklist)\n\n7. Do I leave the sessions feeling good?\n\nThat is all. I really hope it will help me find the right T for me. If it helps you, feel free to steal it :) (and of course alter it to your own needs)\nAnd if you have anything to add to any of them you might think is important, I would be very interested to hear your thoughts! :)\n\nUPDATE 1: I just found the first T I am willing to have a first session with based on the list :))) I spoke to several on the phone, for some of them, I could only check off 1-3 things, but for this guy, every box was checked :) It almost seems like these characteristics go hand in hand (like if someone is warm, they're caring, if they're caring, they will care why I want therapy, if they care, they will sound human, etc). This is of course no guarantee that it'll work out, but I am super-thrilled to have a good feeling about having a first session :) He still has to get back to me about availability so there's no set first session time yet, but I will definitely update again with my first session \"results\" :D Super-excited!\n\nUPDATE 2: I have found my therapist :) Not the one in the 1st update, he was too busy to take me on. But another one did, our first phone conversation made the checklist, so I decided to give her a try, and one of her guidelines in therapy was that the first 2-3 sessions were a trial, and only after that would we mutually decide if and on what terms to start therapy. I really liked that, it made me feel safe and indeed, in the thirds session we discussed how we'd go forward. I'm now 2 sessions into the \"real therapy\" (total of 5 sessions have happened so far, but 1st 2 were the trial, and in the third one we mostly discussed what the therapy would look like). I have already gotten into my childhood, which I thought I'd never be capable of, and I'm super-excited where our first 10 sessions will take us :) (we decided to work in 10 session blocks and set up goals, which suits me really well). So, I guess the list worked? From the time I made the list, this T was my 2nd try, I had one session with another T before her but felt she was rushed and burnt out, but I think the cost of one session is still way better than going to six different therapists over months and just continually feeling alone/ getting re-traumatized so yay! :) for me the list worked. Did anybody use it and have experiences, good or bad? I'd be interested to hear them.",

It’s not about what you say in the session, it’s about creating space for emotions to surface, and sometimes tears do that better than words.\n\nIf it happens again, try this:\n\n* Acknowledge it: Say, “I feel like I can’t stop crying, and it’s hard to talk.” That lets your therapist help you\n* Focus on the feeling: If talking is hard, try describing the emotion behind the tears (sadness, relief, anger?)\n* Trust the process: Some sessions are for releasing emotions, others for problem-solving. Both are valuable\n\nSo if you’ve left a session thinking, What did I even accomplish?, know this… you showed up, you felt, and that’s brave as hell. ",

    "selftext": "I’ve been to this therapist probably around 4 or 5 times. We talked about body image and I told him about how I used to be overweight but am now at a healthy weight. I mentioned that I track my calories in order to maintain my weight. He told me it can easily become an obsession and women shouldn’t be afraid to be curvy. He then wanted me to tell him what specific body parts I am insecure about. I did and he then went on a rant about how models aren’t attractive because “they’re just skin and bones and look very malnourished” and how being muscular or wanting to run a marathon is unhealthy and harming your body. He told me multiple times that I am very pretty and how surprised he is I don’t have a boyfriend. It made me super uncomfortable and feel very watched(?). He is a guy in his 50s or 60s and I don’t feel safe talking to him anymore. He is a good help but the past 2 sessions have been pretty much the same and now I don’t want to mention any of my other issues to him. \nI’m thinking about calling it quits after our next session which has already been scheduled. Just needed to get this off my chest.",

I'm been doing okay and also have a lot of anxiety around phones so the conversation typically lasts 5 minutes. I thought she was just being a good therapist and checking in on me.

I  just let the comments slide.\n\n\\-Last week I got a call from the billing office because I owe money for 5 sessions. These 5 sessions were the 5 minute phone conversations. I refused to pay and explained that I wasn't aware I was being charged a full hour for a short phone call.\n\n\\-My therapist works with the county (it's not a private practice) and my therapy costs first go through my insurance so my insurance has already processed their end of payments for all 5 sessions.\n\nIt's probably silly, but I no longer trust my therapist now and am planning on firing her. Not sure what to do about the payments as well. I'll probably continue to refuse payment, but I also don't want my therapist to get in trouble. Am I overreacting? I honestly feel bad that I'm refusing to pay as I work in the AP department at my job, but I was never aware that I'd be charged a full session for each conversation.",

The first time was in regards to some issues I've been having with a female co-worker, who is mean to me for seemingly no reason. He suggested that she might be jealous of me because I am \"very attractive and have amazing hair and skin.\" I shrugged this off because I figured he was just trying to help me understand her behavior. Then when we were talking about my ex-boyfriend's jealousy he told me that I was a \"total catch\" and that's why my ex was so afraid to lose me. I found that a bit odd. He also told me that I was a \"gorgeous woman\" at one point but I forget the context. Then during our last session, I brought up that I was a health freak (which can make me feel isolated sometimes because some people take offense when I don't want to eat sugar and junk food with them). In response to this, he told me that he could tell that I ate healthy because I have \"glowing skin.\" I feel like this is getting a little out of hand and I just wanted to see if anyone has had a similar experience. Is this normal, or is he being unethical? Thank you!",

They helped me through my divorce, find self-love, and adjust to single parent life. I’m not exaggerating when I say this person saved my life.\n\nFrom the jump, I’ve found this person attractive. But, hey, they’re my therapist. So that thought goes into a drawer and we keep doing the work. This past year though things changed.\n\nI wish I could pinpoint exactly when, but my therapist and I started connecting on a very personal level during my sessions. I would hear some of their life, we’d laugh a lot, and I found myself just wanting to be there friend. Even over zoom, it felt completely natural. Honestly, the connection we built always felt very real, personal, but professional. Nothing untoward ever happened.\n\nMy friends joked I may have a crush on them. “Maybe, but it could just be that im latching on because it’s someone who I think is really cool is allowing me to be vulnerable and is offering no judgement.”\n\nAnyway, therapy continues. Thoughts are there, but nothing disruptive.\n\nThat is until last week’s session. We begin and I can tell things are off, they seem stiff, walls are up. But we exchange pleasantries and begin. They tell me that they can no longer see me as a client. That the connection we’ve built has strayed into attraction. Very deep and very real. They admit they’re in love with me.\n\nAnd now I feel flipped. Those feelings I talked myself out of were not only REAL but reciprocated?? We confessed our feelings, cried, then “broke up.” And im devastated. Partly because this romance is completely unrealized, we never got to try. Good chance we never will. Because we’re doing things the right way and not meeting, talking, anything… for two years.\n\nSo. Now it’s past midnight. Im using a burner reddit account to ask strangers online what I should do now. Because I just feel so confused and alone. \n\nAnd the person that I normally would talk to about this OBVIOUSLY out of the question.\n\nI miss them. I loved them. This is the strangest heartache I’ve ever had and I don’t know how to navigate it.\n\nEDIT:\nThanks everyone for the support and comments. Needless to say this is all… weird. I wanted to clarify some things here. My therapist handled this the best way possible. They told me that the second they started feeling feels they sought external counsel through therapists and mentors, and I can only imagine this went on for a while.\n\nI’m in a MUCH better place now, mentally, than when I first started therapy years ago. They helped me through other romantic entanglements and the anniversaries of my divorce before even broaching the subject of their feelings which im very grateful for.\n\nI am also grateful that they disclosed the full nature of their feelings. It didn’t come out right away, we had a long and curious conversation about how we were both feeling. But if I didn’t know the extent of how they felt, I’d probably just be an anxious mess trying to figure out why I was dropped as a client. This way, I have total closure. And THAT feels good.\n\nThey also arranged for me to meet with a couple other therapists if I choose to do so. Honestly, I kinda want a break for a second. Yes, im confused. But I feel safe in myself.",

My one friend, months ago, flat out told me it sounds like he doesn’t see me as person, or at least isn’t treating me like one. I objected, thinking it was my fault. I had just misunderstood him, or I hadn’t been clear when I was in therapy with him, or I was projecting. \n\nI finally got out of that, telling myself I was just going to try a new therapist for a little bit and then go back to him. I had tried terminating before, but it was overwhelming and left me feeling debilitated, like I really was how I think that therapist saw me—helpless and confused, and not worth much without him. \n\nI saw the new therapist, confused, disoriented. I have online messages from the old therapist that I showed the new one. She’s shocked. She also said he dehumanized me.

I’m guessing it might be confusing for you that I am still here. Maybe you are feeling uneasy because you are waiting for that rejection from me, but it hasn’t come yet.

I have no problem with that in general, but I was pretty irritated that she did not include my own reflection and awareness of that, and was writing instead how all of that is still „unconscious“ for me but its slowly „coming to my consciousness“ - which simply is not true, since I precisely ask her about all of this and thats how our therapy sessions have worked. I always felt taken serious in the sessions as a human being with rationality, but in this article I appear literally like a wild, abandoned animal which is not able to interact. \n\nI feel objectified and its a weird experience, furthermore she added information that make my case look worse than it actually is while at the same time revealing details about myself so precise, that someone who knows me a bit could easily see that this is about me. I have friends and colleagues who work as psychologists, so this is actually an issue and at the same time the article is also mentioning my upbringing in an esoteric community, which could potentially even be dangerous.\n\nI should‘ve just read the article before publishing but I was literally not expecting it to be anything like that.\n\nWhat do I do?",

She then started talking about what she thinks of transfems, which included saying\n\n* Trans people in sports isnt fair\n* Trans kids should not receive gender affirming care\n* 1/8 trans people aren't actually trans they are autistic\n* Trans people are only disliked because they shove it down peoples throats, like vegans\n* Trans women shouldn't be allowed in women's restrooms to protect women\n   * I asked if this meant she thought trans women aren't women and she said they'll always be different\n* Trans people regret transitioning\n   * She talked in depth about another client who was regretting transitioning\n\nAt first I was challenging what she said, but after a while I just felt overwhelmed, sad, and just stayed quiet. It felt relentless and just kept going. At some point she talked about how I've been in therapy for a long time, over a year, and that usually people progress past needing therapy. At the end of the session she told me that I can choose between leaving therapy or I can come back next week and work through it. Usually we would book another session but this week she told me to message her if I wanted to book another session. She ended by saying I should think about how this all relates to the situation with my friend.\n\nI left feeling pretty awful. It's as though she was trying to hurt me because I would either deal with it or quit. My gut reaction is to quit therapy with this counselor but I want to know if I'm overreacting. I don't understand what happened, hopefully some of you can give me some perspective, thanks\n\nEDIT: I can't comment because of my account age, but I appreciate all of your advice. I've decided to end therapy with this counselor and seek an alternate counselor. Thank you for all your kind comments",

I thought some of you could relate and might want to laugh with me.\n\nI am really quite horrible to myself, so for the past few months, my therapist has been having me do these 5-minute self compassion meditations in between sessions. I reported a few weeks ago that  it feels really awkward and I don't like it but I will keep going with it.\n\nLast week she asked me to try a 20-minute more intense self compassion meditation. I did it only twice in the week between sessions because it was somehow way too much and I would break down bawling in the first 5 minutes, shut down, and then take quite some time afterwards to recover, and then beat myself up for being so dramatic.\n\nI communicated this in today's session and she said we need to slow way down. We then did a little exercise where I put my hands on various parts of my body and say things like \"My hand is on my leg\" or what have you. She asked if I could connect with what I was saying and I said I wasn't sure that I could. I felt like it could have been anyone's hand on my leg. \n\nShe said my homework for the next little while is going to be to forget about the self-compassion meditation and simply focus on doing this little exercise.\n\nGuys, I have somehow failed the \"be nice to yourself\" part of therapy and got demoted to \"acknowledge your body parts are real and they belong to you\". \n\nWe all have to start somewhere! 😅",

After dragging my feet with seeking therapy for a long time, I felt hopeful after our first session. \n\nOur 2nd session was going well and a similar rapport, although she seemed a little sleepy (I figured, whatever, everyone is sleepy at work sometimes). She was still engaged and responding thoughtfully so I brushed it off. She kept taking drinks from a can, and I realized after the 3rd sip that it was a Miller Lite.\n\nI had been opening up to her for the last 2 sessions about my mother's alcoholism and other addictions, my own alcoholism and addictions - and when it hit me what I was seeing I didn't really know how to react. The squinting, delayed replies, and being off center a lot all kind of clicked and it made me feel weird. I just stopped bringing up new things and she gave me some takeaways and scheduled the next appointment. \n\nI brushed it off at first and tried to forget about it, but I just feel so grossed out and unsure how to proceed. This was only my 2nd session so I know it's still early enough to reasonably back out, but I'm wondering if I should call her office or report it somehow. It just doesn't sit right with me, but I don't know if my family's history with alcohol abuse is clouding my judgment.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all for your reassurance that this wasn't OK. I have reported this to my state's licensing board via their online complaint form. I realize that no action may come of this, but I couldn't just let this go. People with trauma deserve to have safe spaces, and she violated my trust and put me in an unsafe position while I'm speaking about intense things. I couldn't NOT say something and now I'm glad I have. I'll definitely be cancelling our next appointment and finding a new therapist using the better resources suggested here.

She's a good person and has tried her best, but I'm starting to think that therapy isn't healthy for people like me. \n\nI don't have any friends. I don't have any family. I don't have a safety net or a support group to fall back on when times are tough. It's just me. I am isolated and alone, and I have been my entire life. And I've come to accept that there is a very high likelihood that the remainder of my life will be this way too. And I've grown to be okay with that. \n\nBut then I started therapy, and I thought I felt like someone finally saw and understood me. After a year though I'm more depressed than when I first entered her office. \n\nTherapy gave me the feintiest hint of what being seen and heard feels like, but at its core it's a faulty simulation. An imitation of what real connection is supposed to be. Worse still, it's based on a financial transaction. My T may actually care, but at the end of the day I know she only cares because I continue to pay for her time. She doesn't exist outside of those four walls for that one hour every two weeks. She's not there when I need someone by me the most, and I never actually expected that to be the case, but to be given a whiff of what support feels like it only for it to not be there when times are the hardest is, to me, cruel. \n\nIt's like giving a man stranded in the desert a single drop of water. It doesn't satisfy his thirst, it only exacerbates and further highlights how much he is dying of dehydration. ",

    "selftext": "Anyone who decides to stalk my past profile might learn that recently I experienced an abrupt end to therapy which has led to some emotional fall out. Luckily, having experienced my past as I have, much worse and having come through it, I know this: it is often in the times when something happens that shakes us so much and shows us the extent of our emotions that we really learn about who we are and ultimately gain access to the most important life lessons. Holding onto these feelings, however painful, and really experiencing them, is important.  I wanted to reflect on what I have learnt.\n\nSomething that came to me was this yearning I had to have my experience known by someone. Something I had struggled with for so much of life was that the experience of my existence, feelings about meaning and depth of emotion, all happening alone and internally. It was a feeling that nobody had ever been a witness to it. I think anyone who has intense and strong emotions may relate to this feeling, the need for sharing of the strength of emotion but having no way to do it. \n\nAttachment had just not being there since early childhood, and I think I never realise how much I needed it until it happens and is taken away. The experience of a volatile mother meant that I looked to others, including this therapist, as a guide for life rather than myself- looking for something to hold onto because the internal compass never formed. As a result I repeatedly, even during therapy reduced the need for attachment despite the pain I was feeling at it forming. \n\nI have been in the midst of a suicidal depression with this therapist and I had been looking to them, with their philosophical world view, to give my existence some justification, and to argue against the bouts of self loathing. I think in many ways, I glorified their experience of life over mine, viewing theirs as authentic and valid, and mine as not. This is despite knowing that if someone were to ask me what I do, they would likely glorify mine. Perhaps that's what loneliness is, never being able to explain what a void of connection you feel because of how your life outwardly looks. \n\nWhat has come to light over the past week is that one has to learn to live life for yourself, really experience just being alive and that being enough, even if there are no witnesses to it. The thing that had kept me from suicide was the thought of hurting others and the pain it would cause, it was never the feeling that I wanted to live the experience of my own life. I know this from my profession, that one of the most profound things we do as a human being is bear witness to another person's experience. Perhaps when we start to do it for ourselves, we can see that other people have done it for us even if we never knew, and we can see the validity of our own existence outside of a keen witness.",

    "selftext": "Just want to share how the conversation went since I know others have expressed feeling the same way about their own therapists. Bringing this up with them was helpful for me and hopefully it might be helpful for others too.\n\nTL;DR: Had a productive discussion with my therapist, learned that my belief that they hate me is much more complicated than I thought and mostly comes from my aversion to feeling vulnerable.\n\n(I also recently learned that my therapist is on reddit, so if you are a therapist and you recognize yourself in this post, please stop reading & see you next week 😂)\n\nWe'd been talking about how I have trouble being vulnerable because I want to come across as stable and not at all needy or dependent on them. I said that there's a lot that I don't tell them as a result because I feel embarrassed about it. They asked for an example, and I said \"This might sound crazy and irrational, but I'm pretty sure you hate me.\" It was really difficult to admit but it seemed important to bring up at some point because it was affecting the way I was interacting with them; everything I chose to say or not say was through a lens of trying to be more likable, which meant I couldn't really be as open as I wanted to be.\n\nThey said it wasn't crazy and thanked me for telling them. They said they want to understand why I felt this way and asked me what happens in our therapy space, whether it's something about the way we talk or something about them, that leads me to think I hate them. I said I didn't know, it's just how I felt.\n\nThey asked me if I felt this way about my last therapist and I said no. (What they don't know is that I have intense transference with them, which I didn't have with my last therapist. I assume this is relevant.) I insisted that they've done nothing wrong, and for me this meant there was no justification to ever really bring it up with them.\n\nThen they pointed something out which had never occurred to me: Is this belief that they hate me tied to my desire for them to see me as being stable and having my shit together? As in, when I feel like I'm failing to come across as a cooperative, stable client, I become convinced they hate me. This makes sense to me.\n\nTHEN they said, maybe this is about my desire for them to care about me. And I was like, wait what? I'd never admitted to that. They said that this feeling that they hate me might be the result of a need for them to like me and care about me, and that I feel so vulnerable and ashamed about this need that it's easier for me to believe that I am hated. (They pointed out that this is a theme in other relationships in my life.) I think they're right on the money here.\n\nThey asked me again why I feel so convinced they hate me. I told them I think I'm a horrible client and that they probably wish they didn't have to see me. They pointed out that I'm making a lot of assumptions, that they didn't have to see me if they didn't want to, that they would transfer me if they thought we weren't a good fit.\n\nThey asked me if I had a desire to impress them. I was definitely caught off-guard by this question, since I have not brought up the intense transference I have for them. The real answer is a resounding DUH, everything I do is to impress you lol, but I ended up saying something like \"Uh... I think so.\" They said that this is likely another cause; my need to impress them makes me feel vulnerable so my mind defaults to \"They hate me.\" I'd never thought about that before.\n\nAnyway, this is how the conversation played out. The whole thing was pretty eye-opening and there's a lot for me to process. (I still believe they hate me though lol.) Curious to know if any of this rings true for others.",

    "selftext": "I'm asking this as a serious question that leaves me perplexed.  Therapists and those who have had positive experiences with CBT based work, please enlighten me here. \n\nPersonally, I spent years in CBT/DBT based private practice therapy and ultimately made very little progress.  It feels like the approach is very paint-by-numbers, and helps with changing thought patterns and insights, but is terrible for emotional regulation skills.  Even DBT, which is supposed to be the go-to for emotional regulation, feels more like a management system, a band aid to quick slap over a person's core wounds.  To me, both always felt very pathologizing - like I was a person with a diagnosis that needed to be managed, rather than a person that was allowed to exist just as myself with my pain.  If that makes sense.\n\nOver the past year, through tons of research, I've discovered different, much more niche modalities like IFS and AEDP.  Both of these have been a huuuuuuge game changer for me and I've made so much more progress in much less time than I have with other modalities.  I recently did an AEDP group, and it BLEW MY MIND y'all.  Like, that program fundamentally changed me in ways I didn't even think was possible.  And now I can't help but wonder why I didn't know about this years ago when every private practice therapist was trying to shove intensive DBT down my throat.  \n\nSo clearly, I've found what clicks for me, but now in retrospect, it raises all these questions I have about why CBT is so popular and who it even helps.  Like what are some examples of cases where CBT treatment was a win?  What types of people respond well to it?  What use does it actually have?  And why is it so popular compared to more experiential and emotion focused treatments?  I worry that CBT is potentially going to do more harm than good for some people because of its cultural popularity right now and low barrier to entry.",

    "selftext": "Today was my first session with a new counselor, and she requested that I not use profanities. IS THIS NORMAL OR WEIRDD OR????\n\nDetails:\n\nThis caught me off guard, as I was in the middle of explaining some serious trauma (which resulted in debilitating PTSD). When she spoke, I was very surprised my use of the \"f word\" to be what she brought to attention. Not that it realllly matters, but I don't even swear that much, and I don't direct cursing at individuals/don't express them with intensity (ex. of cursing to validate: \"and then \\[traumatic event\\] happened, which was super f\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* up,\" never anything like \"that dumb b\\*\\*\\*\\* is so f\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* \").\n\nI let her know that I had never been asked to refrain from expressing myself freely by a counselor before, and that when talking about traumatic experiences, I find that occasional swearing helps me validate myself. She responded by telling me that she believed I could find a better way to express myself, and that for her it was \"hard to hear\" profanities from her clients all day. I see her point, but the interaction left me feeling like I've been reprimanded and even judged for my choice of language, which immediately makes me distrust her.\n\nMoving forward in the session, my words no longer \"flowed,\" and I found myself watching my language a lot. I felt like my attention was no longer fully on my needs and feelings, but rather I was in super mindfulness/accommodating others mode. I've literally never been asked this. I understand not swearing in professional settings or around kids, but I feel that I should be able to say \"BS\" in therapy if I'm talking about literally the worst things I've ever experienced!\n\nI understand that counselors are people and that all people should be able to set reasonable boundaries based on their needs, so I'm a bit conflicted about whether or not this situation is normal?\n\nMaybe just not a good fit. Thanks for reading!\n\nUPDATE: Thanks for the support! I ended up calling the organization and requesting a new counselor. I now have an appointment with someone new set up, and this will be in person as opposed to over the phone (a service that the previous T claimed wasn't available). YAY! Really proud for making that call and not just rolling with it, as I might've in the past. :) ",

    "title": "Had an argument with my therapist, I don't think I'm at fault, what do I do?",
    "selftext": "I've been with my therapist for just over 2 years and it's been great, I've made lots of progress and made some major positive life changes as a result. Last week I noticed he was starting to fall asleep around half way through the session. His eyes were heavy and he kept glancing at the clock on the wall. This was obviously quite offputting and I didn't mention anything until he actually fell asleep for a second.\n\nI asked if he was ok and he said he'd not had any coffee all day. It was pretty much the end of the session anyway so we made some small talk and I left as usual. I was a little annoyed that he'd fallen asleep and that half a session had been a waste of time, but we're all human and these things happen sometimes. \n\nI saw him yesterday, and I'd forgotten that he'd fallen asleep in the previous session. He brought it up and asked how I felt about it. It caught me off guard so I played it down, said that these things happen and made a joke that I'd bring him coffee in future if he was sleepy. I also joked about having to make sure I'm less boring in future. I felt uncomfortable making a big deal out of it and didn't really want to hurt his feelings.\n\nHe then tells me that he'd spoken to his therapist about the incident, and the reason that it happened was due to his lack of coffee and my lack of emotion in the session (he felt that I was holding back or hiding how I really felt). I was quite surprised by this, and told him that I felt he was blaming me for his unprofessional behaviour. He was very keen to point out that he wasn't putting blame on anyone, but that's how it came across, how I felt, and he didn't seem to accept that. I didn't want to carry on the discussion as I'd had a pretty terrible week that I really needed to talk about with him.\n\nWe ended up arguing about the incident for over 20 mins. I was quite angry. He didn't apologise or show any remorse. He told me that on the day, mine was the only session he fell asleep in. I think he told me this to try and justify my responsibility for him falling asleep, but I found it pretty hurtful.\n\nI was very direct with him, I told him that it's entirely his fault if he falls asleep and it's also up to him to challenge me if he feels I'm not showing emotion or hiding things. I don't feel like any of this is my responsibility but I'd really appreciate feedback if you think I'm wrong.\n\nI'm left in the position that I'm very angry, woke up feeling very low, and I have to decide if I carry this relationship on, or fire him. How can I trust him if he tries to make me partly responsible for something that's not my fault?",

    "title": "I have had three sessions with a new therapist and I'm thinking there are a lot of red flags... What do you all think?",
    "selftext": "\n\nSo I have only seen this therapist three times and one side of me is saying I should see her a few more times and give her a chance but another side of me is saying I should just tell her that I don't want to continue. Since my first session with her my anxiety has been much worse and I have a horrible feeling about her and going to the sessions in general. But I don't know if it's just me being anxious and paranoid. Here are some examples of some of the things that have happened during sessions. This is long I'm sorry. \n\n\n1. during my first session she jumped out at me from behind the door to give me a fright... This was my first time meeting her and when I jumped and kinda screamed a bit as a I got a shock, she just kept laughing at me and said it's something she does to all her new clients to get a better understanding of how they react to circumstances. After I calmed down I kinda laughed with her but found it a bit weird. \n\n\n2. she has loads of horror movie dvds on a shelf in her office and asked if I liked horror. When I said I didn't she told me I should give it another chance as she finds that horror movies are healing for people as this can help them put their own traumas into perspective. I laughed when she said this but she had a poker straight face on I think she was being totally serious. I feel like horror movies increase my anxiety a lot but maybe she is right. She also spent 5 mins talking about her grand plan for if there was ever a zombie apocalypse which also increased my anxiety because now I can't stop worrying about another pandemic happening that's even worse than this one. \n\n\n3. She has creepy clown dolls and other weird looking dolls sitting on another shelf which are giving me a huge amount of anxiety and she noticed me staring at them and asked why and I said I found them scary and she just didn't say anything, she just shook her head and looked at me and then at her feet for a bit. I am worried I offended her so have anxiety about that now.\n\n4. I told her one of my main anxieties is around climate change and the planet becoming overpopulated. She said that climate change has been proven to be a hoax by a scientist and that the world will adapt to humans and a larger population etc with time. I think she was trying to help me and be kind but I know that's not true and now I just feel like I can't discuss this because she doesn't believe in it? \n\n5. She eats during the sessions. The whole time. I feel so bad moaning about this as of course she should eat if she needs but I have a lot of anxiety about food in general (family has an eating disorder and I have a lot of troubles with disordered eating...). She eats stuff like sausage rolls, pasta pies, crisps etc and I'm quite sensitive to the noise and smells of them 🙁 I know that sounds dumb but it is something that I'm starting to dread about sessions. She tries to give me food too and I really hate eating Infront of people so I decline but she kept going on about it. I'm worried I upset her by not taking the food. \n\n6. I told her about my chronic pain/migraines and she started advising me of different herbs and stuff I can use to make tea with which would help. I know she's trying to be kind but it felt quite dismissive of these pains that I really suffer with as herbs won't help.\n\n7. she told me that my anxiety will be better if I get a job and find a sense of purpose. I'm sure she's right but I felt judged and I don't think she understood that my anxiety makes it hard to turn up for interviews etc. She recommended different house plants and oils to boost my confidence but again I don't believe in this.\n\n8.  a white cat walked across the path when I was leaving last time and she screamed that it was bad luck for us both and chased the cat down the road..I have felt anxious about the bad luck ever since and she said I should be careful for a few days. \n\n9. she does listen to me sometimes but often appears bored if I speak too much as she looks around the room or out the window or starts massaging her fingers and stuff. I feel bad talking too much. \n\n10. she wants me to pay monthly cash sums rather than weekly so that her bills etc can be covered as she's worried about getting her kitchen done up and about paying her nutritionist or something.\n\n11. She sometimes calls me randomly between sessions and I don't answer but I did once and she said she just wanted to check on me and was asking me stuff like what did I eat for breakfast which I found really triggering. I hung up and pretended I lost signal. She has then texted me a few times just stuff like *\"good morning - today is a great day to have a great day\"* or *\"prawn cocktail crisps are top tier crisps and I don't care what anyone says!! You better agree!\"* This gave me anxiety too and I didn't know what to respond.\n\nOverall I just feel so anxious and paranoid about this therapist and I'm dreading my session on Tuesday. But I am also worried this is all a normal part of the therapy process and I'm better to just persevere with it rather than starting the whole thing over again with someone else who will be the same? I feel scared all the time and worry about the sessions. What should I do?",

    "title": "Erotic Countertransference in therapy",
    "selftext": "There is a post over on the Pyschotherapy subreddit where a therapist is seeking advice on handling an attraction to one of their clients. Some of the replies leave me in no doubt why therapists so rarely disclose these feelings (and I don’t mean disclose to the client, I mean disclose to a supervisor for guidance) - some replies are telling the therapist to not think about the feelings, to force stop thinking about them. Some of the responses are *very* shaming, and wildly alarmist. This is far from ideal as it makes other therapists less likely to get guidance and support on an issue that could cause them considerable anxiety.  \n\n\nAs long as a therapist does not act on their feelings, and does not let them affect the therapy, there are a wealth of useful things these feelings might be uncovering, and the therapist could use this to help a client. Just as with erotic transference, erotic countertransference shouldn’t be a shameful thing as long as it is handled appropriately and no boundaries are crossed. Therapists are human too and I feel really bad for the therapist who posted the query. Feelings are feelings, they are not actions. Suppressing or ignoring feelings is a sure way to make a problem where maybe there wasn’t one.\n\nAnyway, for any lurking therapists who may have experienced similar - I see nothing shameful in it and I think anyone who discloses this in supervision with the aim of getting guidance and support is a good therapist.",

All that.\n I said that in response when my therapist said I'm one of the positive women she's meet because I was shocked. She said “Well they don't know what you're going through & have been through, either. Don't they? “ which is true. \n\nShe said I'm incredibly positive for someone who lives in an abusive situation because I'm always considering the better side of things, planning for them & always look bright which I laughed at cause I can't take compliments but she seemed pretty genuine. I get iffy about therapists giving compliments but she seemed to truly mean it. So yeah. That just made me really happy, it also feels validating because someone sees that I'm going thru a lot & have been but they also see I'm trying hard to do better which I'm constantly told I don't try hard enough. Probably because I don't really show people or tell people expect for my therapist just how hard I'm really trying with every little thing. Anyways.",

When I arrived, things were already happening, I joined in, and one of the participants had looked super familiar but I couldn’t quite remember. Went about my business, then left. \n\nWhen I got home, I realized that the person who looked familiar was a former therapist of mine that I briefly saw some years ago. He had kept looking at me, which I thought was that he was just into me, and in hindsight, I now wonder if he recognized me and that this was a turn on for him. This really had me thinking about navigating things in the LGBTQ/kink community with running into therapists, clients, etc. Occasionally, I’ll go to a bathhouse or different events, and now knowing that he also runs in this circle has me feeling pretty funky. Curious to hear from others (clients who’ve had other experiences or therapists who have to navigate this).\n\nNote: I’d appreciate if comments focused less on sex-shaming related to sexual practices and more on the client-therapist relationship in this context.",

    "title": "I 'graduated' from therapy this week and these are my thoughts on getting the most out of therapy",
    "selftext": "So I \"graduated\" from therapy on Monday of this week. I was hesitant to wrote this cos people can be argumentative for no damn reason so be gentle...please.🥺\n\n1. For therapy to work you need to prioritise it.\n\nWhen i went into therapy for the second time in my life i thought it could be a cool side gig. I go in for an hour, pay ateention, be responsive and then leave and forget about therapy and my therapist. I guess i treared it like those who do casual hook ups might treat their hook ups.\n\nBut therapy isnt a side hustle or casual hook up. It is not a comfort food you use cos you feel shit. You have have to make it a priority. You have to honor the time, honor your own health and be good to your therapist. .\n\nDo the work. The moment i knew i was getting out from the emotional gutter was when i told my mum no to catering to something SHE had priorotised for herself. I said \"No i will not cancel my session even if i can.\" \n\nPrioritise therapy. And youll see yourself begin to prioritise yourself. \n\n2. Therapy and therapists have limitations and boundaries\n\nIt sounds obvious but therapy is not a panacea. It was tempting at times to seek all my answers and support from therapy and therapist but there are limits to therapy's prowess. And there are limits to what your therapist can and can not do and BE for you. Nor should they wittingly or unwittingly position themselves as your survivor or a specialist in all areas. \n\n Be realistic and fair ito what you expect from your therapist but also, ill add, get everything you can out of their expertise. Werk them bestie!\n\n3) You may fall in love with your therapist or feel like you have fallen in love\n\nIt may be romantic love, famillial love or platomic love but you may find youself feeling a rush of 'wow ive found the missing piece' around them and even when youre away. I cant speak to how much of it is what we all know as transference or idealism about them, and how much is genuine. BUT i do know that a good therapist welcomes all feelings and will tell you if your handling thereof may be unhelpful or unhealthy...even if not directly. They will be open to discussing all this and more to help you grow as a person and adress the actual reason you are in therapy. They will also never try and romance, mother or friend you by inviting you out etc. Transferrence is hard and confusing but once your therapist knows and if they respond professionally you may feel safe in those feelings and they will probably pass.\n\nIn the last few montha of therapy i had a brief but very healthy connection with a woman that has greatly contributed to my healing in ways i did not expect. I would be remiss if i didnt credit my therapist for helping me find the tools to do that within myself, to connect with tje right person at the right time. She isnt perfect but it was the healthies connection id had in a while. Your therapist should be pushing you to get your needs met outside of therapy and giving you those tools.\n\n\n4. Healing is not always linear, at least not the whole time.\n\nI thought i would deal with everything chronologically for some reason. But when we started the deep sharing some randon thing would pop up into my memory and i was back to feeling scared, lonely or abonded in the way i did as a child. As new information comes to you through therapy or art or anything else  that helps you explore and express...different parts of your life start to look different. And you realise 'wow thats actually something i never spoke about that i need yo adress. That was a big deal.' Or 'wow. Im actually good enough. Look at how i managed to do xy\". But when all of you is insync i would say that happens less and the healing feels less like a roller coaster.\n\n5) You are the expert on your life and your self and needs and wants\n\nYour therapist has the technical knowledge but only you know yourself best...i am of the beleif that not even our partners know us better than we do. \n\nFeel free to correct your therapist based on your kniwledge of you and your life. Feel free to be yourself and not the person your therapist may or may not peg you to be.\n\nYou are the expert on you and what you need. If therapy leaves anyone with anything i  hope its a sense of autonomy and feeling in charge of how they live their life.💛",

    "selftext": "Today marks 2 years sober for me. 2 years since my therapist gave me an ultimatum that I have no doubt saved my life. \n\nI started drinking at 12, was doing pills by high school, full blown alcoholic in college, grad school introduced cocaine and ecstasy, as an adult I started doing opiates and benzos. To say I have substance abuse issues is a vast understatement. I’ve almost overdosed several times (a few on purpose, a few happy accidents I guess). (This is a frighteningly abridged version but no one wants to read my journey through addiction-hell lol)\n\nApril 15, 2020 I had a virtual therapy session from which I have only the vaguest flashes of memories. I had taken several ambien, a couple of vicodin, and a few shots of vodka. I was fuuuuuucked up. Apparently passing out and slurring and mostly incoherent. The next day I scheduled an emergency appointment (for which I was sober) and was lucky she could see me.\n\nShe gave me an ultimatum: get some specialized substance abuse treatment or I can’t work with you. I cried. I felt betrayed. All the things, you know. She also said the most important thing she ever said to me that day: “you’ve been trying to tell me something and I wasn’t seeing you. But I see you. I hear you. And I want to help you.” So I finally let her help. I begrudgingly got into an IOP program and stayed in for a year. I’m still sober today.\n\nI owe her my life. She retired almost exactly one year ago (end of March was a year) and I fortunately had enough sense to thank her for seeing me when I felt most invisible, for hearing me when I felt like I was screaming into the void, and for finding me when I was so lost. She was an incredible therapist and it’s a damn shame her time doing it had to be finite. The world is a better place because people like her exist.\n\nAnd on that note, I’d like to take a moment to thank all of you therapists who might be reading this for being those who see, hear, and find those of us who feel invisible. People like me owe you all a debt of gratitude.",

    "title": "Therapist said I shouldn't correct her when she misgenders me",
    "selftext": "Howdy all, I am a longtime lurker in this sub and am a therapist myself, so I'm feeling a little embarrassed that I'm processing this here. I am just trying to make sense of what happened during a recent session with my own therapist because I'm quite honestly shocked and deeply hurt. I'm feeling really tender and floaty right now, so apologies in advance for the inevitable rambling and run on sentences! \n\nFor context, I have been seeing my therapist for over 5 years primarily for complex ptsd/ early interpersonal trauma. We do fantastic deep, relational work together and I'm generally happy with our therapeutic relationship. I am transmasculine and when I first started seeing my therapist I still went by my deadname and, though \"out\" as trans, hadn't begun medically transitioning yet so I was definitely read as female. I'm currently several years on T at this point and have had top surgery. I hardly ever get misgendered in my day to day and pass as male fairly well, in fact too well sometimes because I don't even necessarily want to be read as a cis guy.\n\nMy therapist has had a difficult time gendering (he/they, literally just pick anything but she/her) me correctly since I began medically transitioning, and it took her a good year to quit calling me by my deadname. I'm so used to this and know that she isn't doing it intentionally, so most of the time I let it slide, especially if she corrects herself. I probably haven't brought it up in over a year actually. However, in my last session with her I brought up that in our last session she misgendered me again and she immediately cut me off and said \"I'm not going to talk about this with you\" and I was so shocked and confused. It was completely out of character for her and I had a hard time even processing that those were the words she said. \n\nI immediately went into trauma mode (I'm a victim of some pretty intense grooming that started when I was 12, and one of the tactics my abuser would use is shutting me down when I tried to bring up points that could be seen as me criticizing or questioning them) and tried to address it in the moment. And she just kept digging a hole deeper and deeper. She essentially just kept repeating that I should trust she had no ill intent and that she felt I was putting her on blast, judging her, and generally being unfair to her. To which I responded that my intent is just to express I felt hurt and wanted to address how I felt it impacted our relationship, and that in fact I hold back how her misgendering makes me feel because I know she doesn't do it with any ill intent and I don't want her to feel badly about it. She refused to stop being defensive (at one point she actually said \"you know I have other trans clients, so I don't have a problem with trans people\")  and eventually I said something to the effect of even if I was putting her on blast that trans people don't owe you grace when you fuck up, especially when you do it consistently and repeatedly with no indication that you're trying to work on it. I pretty much told her that whatever was going on for her that her immediate reaction was to shut me down was her own shit to take care of and work through, not mine.\n\nShe then proceed to try to say that the reason I feel the need to correct her is because of my own shame I feel around being trans. My jaw literally dropped. I tried to point out how fucked up it is to deflect a mistake she made and tried to make it about my shame. It got to a point that I just started tearing up and asked \"why are you doing this to me?\" She just wasn't understanding me and all she kept doing was coming up with wild excuses why I was wrong for \"calling her out,\" and that I should just let it go when it happens and not bring it up.\n\nI'm not really sure why I'm even making this post, other than the fact that I just feel so hurt and frankly gaslit. I 100% understand that something is obviously going on for her and that's why I got the reaction I did, but it is SO unlike her that I just keep second guessing if that interaction even happened. And at the same time, it's not surprising. I know it's not fair to generalize, but it's so rare to find a cis person who is willing to not get defensive when being corrected when they misgender or deadname. So this just felt like a representation of that. I even asked if I should just generally stop correcting other people in my life when they repeatedly make mistakes that hurt me, because that's the message I was getting, to which I got \"well no, you should correct them, but...\" We've had a few significant ruptures over the last 5 years and generally are able to work past them, but I don't know if I want to work past this, and I don't think I can trust her to guide the process of moving past this.\n\nI think I just am needing validation that what she did wasn't okay. I'm not even upset about the misgendering, truly, just that her reaction was so defensive and so quick to shut me down. Like, it obviously doesn't make her a bad person and I don't think she hates trans people, but it's not okay to turn my bringing up a mistake she made into somehow saying that I'm only bothered by it because I'm ashamed of being trans. I feel way too hurt and vulnerable, and honestly betrayed at this point.\n\n\n**edit 9/27: I'm so grateful for the overwhelmingly positive and validating response from folks! I cannot give each and every comment the reply it deserves but please know I've read them all and really appreciate the support. I have a lot to think about in terms of next steps but receiving all of this feedback has really shifted my perspective. ",

    "selftext": "TL;DR - see title\n\n——\n\nI did the most vulnerable thing I’ve ever done in my life. (Sorry, this is going to be long.)\n\nI have been obsessed with my therapist for over three years. Due to past trauma, I immediately latch onto anyone of their gender (trying to keep it vague) who shows me any kindness and compassion. The transference is both erotic and parental. It doesn’t help that they are physically my type.\n\nI think of them night and day. I have not dated or sought any kind of relationship in three years because I prefer the safety of my unrequited obsession with my therapist. I have journaled over a thousand pages (not an exaggeration—I spend 10+ hours journaling every week) and they are mentioned on every single page.\n\nI have a body pillow in my bed that I hug and pretend is them. It’s a huge source of comfort for me and helps me fall asleep. I live alone and I talk out loud in my empty apartment to my therapist in a constant, never-ending imaginary conversation. I also talk to them (in my head) in public, non-stop. The obsession has consumed me and my life, and at this point, I don't know who I'd be without it. I live my life like this.\n\nThe pain of knowing my feelings will never be reciprocated is excruciating. Every day, every moment, the grief is there and top-of-mind. It's the primary source my ongoing depression, self-harm, and suicidal ideation, but they don’t know that, and I always wished I had the courage to tell them.\n\nI have hidden all of this from them for three years. (I’m actually kind of impressed with myself for this.) I have wanted to tell them about it this entire time because I need them to help me understand and resolve these feelings and address it in the safe space of therapy.\n\nHowever, I’ve been terrified to tell them. I feel so much shame about the intensity of my feelings and how it has taken over my life. I worry that sharing this with them—that they have been lied to (by omission) for this long and that they are unknowingly involved in my mental health drama—will destroy their trust in me (or worse, leave them feeling disgusted that I have these feelings for them) and practically guarantee my abandonment.\n\nI’ve been able to endure the pain for years but it’s reached a breaking point where I’m unable to work or be mentally present anymore. I'm worried about losing my job. I also feel immense guilt for hiding this from them because we have a great rapport and I worry that will go up in smoke.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nWELL, I admitted my feelings last week. I didn’t want to do it verbally so I made a whole website (lol) that explains my feelings and how I have wanted to tell them but was too terrified of the consequences. It includes select journal entries from the last three years to help them understand just how much I’ve been suffering with this situation. I gave them the website URL at the very end of our last session, so they have read it but we have yet to discuss it.\n\nReading these entries, they have now learned:\n\n* How the sheer intensity of my obsession with them has taken over my life\n* How I desperately fantasize about a different world in which they could love me back\n* How I wish I were their spouse, and that knowing that this is impossible makes me want to die\n* How  I’m so attracted to them that it makes them hard to look at because I’m overwhelmed by how physically gorgeous they are\n\nI feel so pathetic. How the hell can I ever make eye contact with them again now that they know these things??\n\nThe humiliation is soul-crushing and I want to ghost them. Our next session is tomorrow and it will be the first time we will discuss the contents of the website/journal entries. I have no idea how I can ever face them again when I have so much shame and humiliation about this.\n\nI guess I should be proud of myself for finally mustering up the courage to admit everything to them. I deeply struggle with vulnerability and avoid it like the plague, which is why for years my therapist has gently yet persistently pushed me to be more vulnerable with them. Well, they’ve gotten their wish in spades.\n\nI'm not necessarily seeking advice with this post (I will definitely be addressing this in therapy), but I just wanted to share this momentous event in my therapeutic relationship even though I don't know what the outcome will be. I really appreciate the empathy and lack of judgement this sub provides.\n\nI'm also open to hearing what folks have to say about the whole thing, whether positive or critical. I know there is a lot to be critical of. I considered posting this anonymously but decided I want to own up to it.\n\nIf you made it this far, I wish I could give you a gold star sticker to put wherever you want. I would put mine in the middle of my forehead and then forget it was there before going out in public. Thanks for reading.",

    "selftext": "My therapist met with me at her house many times to bypass her waiting list and costs. We’d meet for hours. Told me she’d never do it with other clients. Friended family members on Facebook. Commented and liked every post that had to do with me. I would scroll through my family’s likes to ensure she was one of them. I was 18 with maternal transference issues to the core, and I knew it was breaking ethical boundaries. But wow, did it satisfy me at the time and make me feel loved. \n\nAs I opened up to her, however, I started to wonder what other boundaries she would break. I began to get progressively paranoid over whether she would break ethical guidelines meant to protect my privacy, as well (hipaa). I had no concept of boundaries with her, and she became my only confidant. I would see a post of her on vacation on a week she was scheduled off and it would hurt my feelings intensely. On a daily basis, I rotated between a cycle of love and rage. I would place her on a pedastool as an idealistic mother figure and ripped her off of it as an untrustworthy mental health professional. \n\nIt took me over a year to realize that her feeding into the transference, exactly what my heart wanted, was making me trust her less and hurting me even more. It took me another two years to admit this out loud and end the relationship. It destroyed me. I needed therapy from her, not a mother. \n\nI want to share this because transference is painful, and so many people talk about it on this sub. I know that a lot of you want your T to be a mother figure, a relationship figure, etc. I’ve seen posts of people daydreaming over the type of situation I found myself in. I don’t blame you, because I did too, and still sometimes daydream about going back. Sometimes I daydream about my current T treating me the same way. I wrote out all of the ways it damaged my mental health and have to refer back to the list regularly. \n\n\n\nWhen professional boundaries are bent a little bit, the lines will blur on both sides. Sticking to scheduled session times I can be painful. Your T loves and cares about you, and that is exactly why they enforce boundaries with you.",

    "selftext": "I saw a TikTok recently of a therapist talking about how they often are so many of their clients' \"first\" and how sacred that is. The first to hear your deepest traumas. The first to hear of your successes. The first to hear of how badly you're struggling. This TikTok really struck a chord with me — my therapist has been my \"first\" countless times. The first person who made me feel unconditionally loved. The first person who I told when I got my dream job. The first person I tell when I don't want to be alive anymore.  And in many of these cases, she's not just my first — she's also my \"only.\"\n\nI'm sure I'm not alone in my feelings here, especially in this sub, and I hope we can take a moment to acknowledge all the clinicians who serve that sacred role for us. I tell a lot of people in my life that I love my therapist, but I really do mean it. I *love* my therapist. And it's an absolute honor to be loved by her too. <3",

I know there’s absolutely nothing wrong with self pleasure but every time we have a session, the picture of their huge smile pops up in my head 😂 I wish I never came across that post because I now get distracted in our sessions by thinking about it.

    "selftext": "About a week ago I had a video session with my therapist I've seen a few times and this time she was clearly doing her nails (filing/painting) during our session. I am still relatively new to video therapy so didn't really know how to feel, and if I should expect things to be different from in person. I feel like this would be totally weird during an in-person session but I don't know if this is normal for a video session since they so far have seemed a little more casual to me compared to past experiences. I just felt so strange and a little disrespected talking to her while she was looking down at her nails and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it. Is this enough of an issue to stop seeing this particular therapist or am I overreacting about this? Should I have said something? Do I have to say something about it to her if I decide to stop seeing her?",

    "selftext": "I grew up in a hoarding house and am now in my early 30s and am only recently really starting to dig into my childhood. I started therapy this month and am so glad. My therapist said she’s not surprised I’m seeking therapy now because of my age. I didn’t ask what that means. \n\nIs it because it’s common for people to start reflecting on their childhoods at this age now that they’re safely beyond that point? We haven’t talked about this yet but I don’t want children. Is it common for people to seek therapy before they have children so that they will be better parents?\n\nEdit: to clarify, I’m wondering in terms of people who have been affected by childhood trauma if it is common for people to come out of the fog after their 20s have passed and start to realize they need to seek therapy at that point. I wasn’t aware of how bad things were until I got into my late 20s/early 30s. Does that happen to a lot of people or was that my individual coping mechanisms? Is there research that shows this is a common age when people start to process their traumas? \n\nI realize people start therapy at all different ages for many different reasons.\n\nEdit 2: thanks for everyone’s replies! It’s been very illuminating. I definitely think my brain protected me for a long time from fully acknowledging what I went through. Until 2 or so years ago if you asked me if anything bad happened to me as a child, I would have said no. Now I’m coming around to the idea that not only was there neglect in terms of my living environment, but also emotional neglect as well.",

    "selftext": "UPDATE: [My husband responds](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalkTherapy/s/plVrVbDVfm). \n\nSo I walked in on my husband’s virtual session by accident. I thought it was done because he was looking at his computer  and not saying anything for awhile. I could see him through the glass doors in the next room but I couldn’t hear anything because the doors are thick and I turn the tv on to block the muffled sounds. Anyway, it was 11:15 and his session started early tonight at 7:45. He gets up at 4:15am for work and still hadn’t eaten dinner and almost no food all day. So I popped in and said, “Are you done?” thinking he was done and I would then ask if I could make his pizza. Well, he wasn’t. I said “Oh, that’s not good.” And proceeded to leave and he tried to stop me so I whispered, “professional issue” and closed the door quickly to get back out of his private session. Well, the therapist abruptly ended the session and apologized and said she would keep it to an hour from now on. All without hearing what my red flag was. She said the extra time was “gift time” from her. Well, last week the same thing happened too. 2.5 hours. \n\nTonight I had this feeling deep in my gut that was building through the night that this was quickly turning into an unprofessional relationship on her end. It was so incredibly strong that I brought it up to him right after. It caused a huge fight because he is unable to look at it from a professional point of view like I am. I know about dual relationships and therapist/client conflict and how it can easily happen. My husband is a likeable guy and he loves to talk. Everyone is sucked in by his personality.  It now he is pissed at me and said I ruined his entire session and I was mean and disrespectful for interrupting him for this reason. (That was not why. If I knew he was still talking I would have waited.) \n\nAm I wrong to be concerned that this is a red flag?",

I need a therapist who will laugh with me, call me out on my bullshit, slip out cuss words when they want to, show interest in talking about the positive things too and not just what’s wrong with me, I need my therapist to actually give a shit about me, not bc they have to, not bc it’s there’s job to, not bc I’m part of their paycheck, but bc I as their client, are important to them. I need them to be human too, or else how would I be comfortable being vulnerable? \n\nSo yes, your therapist is not your friend and my therapist is not my friend, but they are however, more than just a therapist. More than just someone we talk to about our feelings, more than someone who treats our mental illnesses, and maybe there’s not an exact word for it, but even though they aren’t a friend, they’re someone just as important in a very individual way.",

    "selftext": "Ok so I (27m) made a post a few weeks ago about how my sister (13) asked me to sit in on a therapy session and she told me she was really sad by how much I’ve been working and she hated being alone so much, so I took a week long vacation for us to spend together. Today is the first day of that vacation and we both were insanely excited, but she asked if I could sit in on another therapy session with her today. I went in and she said there’s been something she’s been wanting to talk to me about for literally months and since I have some free time, she wanted to tell me today.\n\nOkay so to give you some context, first a story that happened last year.\n\nOur parents suddenly passed away last year, and my sister and I started living together. Within the first few weeks, she and I got into a fight over something stupid and it escalated and we were shouting at each other, and then she said “I wish mom and dad were here and YOU were the one who was dead.” I remember when she said that, I paused and then quietly said “agreed” and walked away. I went to my room and cried for a bit (not entirely because of what she said, just because everything about the situation was difficult). I pulled myself together and a little later she told me she was sorry and I told her I was sorry things had been so rough. We hugged it out and moved on and things have been great between us.\n\nSo we sat down in the session today and she essentially told me that it still haunts her she said that and she still feels absolutely horrible and feels like she never expressed just how much she didn’t mean it and how sorry she was she said that. I went “oh pfft come on, don’t even worry about that, you’re fine” and she got upset by that and went “but I am worrying about it!” and started talking about how she’s lost sleep over the fact she’s said that and she’s not convinced she isn’t a bad person for saying it. I tried to tell her again it really is no problem and I didn’t at all take it to heart, and she actually said “STOP” and told me she took it to heart and it’s a big deal for her and she still hasn’t forgiven herself for it, then she started crying.\n\nThe therapist then asked me if I had any thoughts on the matter and I just told her I had no idea how much this was weighing on her. I didn’t wanna say “it’s no big deal” because that was clearly invalidating for her so I just leaned over and hugged her and held her while she cried. When she had calmed down, I told her she’s the best little sister in the whole world, my best friend, she makes all the work hours worth it, and I love her more than anything in the world.

If I’m being completely honest, it did hurt my feelings when she said that and I do think about it every once in a while, but I had no idea this was hurting her so much. After we got home, I told her I was going to take a nap because I’m still pretty tired from all the hours I was working. I went to my bed and then she actually came into my room and snuggled up next to me as I fell asleep.\n\nSo…that caught me off guard and I don’t really know what to do with that.\n\ntl;dr: my younger sister told me she wished I was dead last year and this morning asked me to sit in on her therapy session and VERY emotionally told me it’s been weighing on her very heavily for over a year and she still hasn’t forgiven herself for it, leading her to break down crying.",

    "selftext": "This will probably be long, and I guess what I'm asking is for you to play devil's advocate because I cannot understand her decisions. Also TW for mentions of suicide.\n\nSo in July, I emailed my therapist I wad canceleing that week's session, I didn't get a reply nor email confirmation but I check the onlinr portal, and the session was canceled. Our last session had went okay, but I could feel myself not putting enough effort in and the cost is always a thing especially now more than ever since I'm unemployed. The following week I decided I wanted to take a break and told her so in an email. I never received a reply or any follow-up. But seeing how I just wanted to be left to my own device I was okay without a reply.  In August I told my psychiatrist I didn't want to take my medications anymore. I was mostly on stuff that was used off label for depression and stuff because it had low side effects. At this time I just wanted to go it on my own. \n\nAt the end of September, I emailed my therapist and told her I no longer wanted to continue therapy and thought we should do so in a session. In past, whenever we just took breaks that were longer than a month she'd always attempt to do an ending session, or at least a phone call saying things like \"I'm officially closing the case\" and such. So I thought a session would be better than a 5 min call, and since she hadn't replied to my emails before I thought I had to contact her in some way anyway to end it.\n\nSo now where at the session, she starts it like any other session where we would just be catching up. But I push for know the procedure or whatever these sessions were supposed to look like and go over. Were we supposed to ask final questions and such?  I said I can't continue paying for something I'm not putting enough effort in and that I still need find the motivation to even want to get better sometimes. A little after that she asked if I had any suicidal thoughts, I answered honestly which was yes. I've struggled with thoughts since I was a teenager and she was well aware of it. I also answered honestly because I trusted she wouldn't overreact. We had already been through that and hospitalization left me traumatized because I was sent because she said I had the thoughts too long, and that she was worried. I had plans with friends and my dad that weekend I canceled. Anyway, we got past it, I told myself she misread me as more a danger than I was because my antidepressants had me feel like a zombie and apathetic and me not even feeling the need to clarify led to this miscommunication. So yeah, when she asked I told her but I also told her I wasn't planning anything. That my mom's birthday was the next day. But it was like she'd stop listening. I reminded her how badly I reacted last time, and that this would only put me in a worse state. My anxiety around people has gone up since quarantine, also with everything about cops in the news anxiety I've had about them all my life as a black person has been even higher. I found myself getting frustrated because she seemed to have her mindset. I tried mentioning every little thing, from small inconveniences like I have packages coming almost every day until next week to how awful it'd be to have the cops show up at the door. By the end of the session, she said she wasn't and she'd have her assistant email recommendations for treatment and hoped I'd look into them. There were other parts of the session that got odd too. Like at one point it felt she was trying to give me a \"hard truth\" she said \"you wonder why you're alone and lonely and it's because you push people away\" my response was that I've literally never *wondered* that I'm highly aware that I push people away and that it's hurtful to them and feel awful about it. And other similar stuff she said like she was telling me something I didn't just say moments before. Towards the end, she was also saying things like. \"I don't think this is going to have to be the end of me treating\" which made no sense because I contacted her and the whole point of the session was that I wanted to actually end treatment, that this wasn't a see you later. So that's why I wanted an ending session and not a 5-minute phone call.\n\nThen an hour and a half later I open my door expecting a package left by an amazon courier to have two cops with their hand on their guns. Sheer terror washed over me. They put handcuffs in my hallway in front of my neighbors and I was patted down while another 2 arrived and I was pat down again for longer in my pajamas. I was in handcuffs for the next 4 hours, I was in reoccurring anxiety attack trying to breathe and tell the cops it was just anxiety and I promised it wasn't resistance and explain I wasn't going to hurt myself.  I hoped none of my reactions would make them think that me, who barely managed 100lbs needed harsher treatment. That they'd see I had no criminal record or even and parking/driving tickets and see I wasn't someone bad. At the station, they kept me in holding in handcuffs telling me I wasn't in trouble while sitting next to proud gang members. Some type psych officer came to talk to me. I told him and tried to explain best I could, but he was pretty honest that when it came down to it he was obviously gonna trust my therapist that called my cops and they'd at least have to hold me overnight unless she said it was okay to let me go. So I was moved to a another holding area, not a hospital. They just had a doctor a few nurses and a lot of security that would give you something to stay calm, and from what I see they were letting you go as long as you just sat in that chair(no beds) 'til morning. If you misbehaved they'd send you away.\n\nI can't understand any of her decisions. But the biggest is why did she lie and say she wasn't going to call the cops and do it anyway. She could have told me my options where to go check myself in or have the cops, but she didn't. She could have called my parents and sent them, but she only called them to tell them what she did. One of the biggest things anyone with suicidal thoughts fears is that their therapist will jump the gun and have them committed the moment the mention even if they don't have a fully fleshed-out plan. I still feared that and it kept me from seeing other therapists, but I thought well it happened once surely she'd be more careful about how she goes about this. I thought because so many times she'd push for me admit to suicidal thoughts when I said I wasn't having them, to even telling me that if I said I didn't have them she didn't believe me. I thought we discussed police brutality, and there are things in the news about how police will be moving away from mental health calls. I don't know why she didn't believe or trust me, or what type of proof I could have provided that would have changed her mind. But if she was still %100 her choices still make no sense to me.",

    "selftext": "On my previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalkTherapy/comments/pwh993/not_sure_if_i_should_tell_my_therapist_how/), people unanimously commented that I should be honest with my therapist about how painful it is to have my sessions constantly rescheduled last-minute. We did finally meet last week and I ended up giving my therapist a written description of my anxiety about this as well as how I broke down the other day (when I showed up to an empty office because they forgot to tell me we were doing telehealth) because it was too embarrassing to say any of it out loud.\n\nThey apologized and thanked me for being open with them - in fact, they said they felt honored that I felt safe enough with them to express my needs! I told them that I was worried I was being selfish and self-centered by making such a big deal out of a miscommunication. They said it's not selfish to have needs and that it's helpful for them to know that predictability is so important to me because it helps them plan their schedule more carefully and be a better therapist to me. They weren't upset at all, and they said that resolving this misunderstanding was an opportunity for us to become closer.\n\nI don't think it's realistic for the last-minute rescheduling to stop altogether, but I'm just glad I was even able to have this honest conversation with them at all. I'm very conflict avoidant and I'm still shocked that they reacted so warmly. I'm certain my work with them would have completely unravelled over time if I hadn't said anything, but instead I seem to have done something that has strengthened our therapeutic alliance.

Addressing my own parental wounds has been an overarching theme, and treatment involved re-living a lot of really horrible things- it sucked so hard, especially in the beginning. \n\nI \"graduated\" therapy last week feeling a little uncertain about whether ending treatment was the best choice, but my therapist thinks that I am ready, and I trust him.\n\nLast night, my 8 year old son was having trouble transitioning from our cuddly movie night to bedtime. I asked him why he didn't want to go to sleep, and he said that he had too much energy in his body. To be fair, he had just been in (mostly) one spot for an hour while we watched a movie.\n\nI tried offering big body stretches to regulate, nope, he didn't want to do that. I suggested wiggles, to move the energy he was feeling through his body. Nope. I was feeling frustrated at this point, and without really thinking about it, found myself regulating with and simultaneously modeling deep breaths. Kiddo picked up that I was modeling and started sarcastically sighing loudly to the cadence of my breathing. I spontaneously decided then that I'd try tickling him. I did, and he laughed. I paused and waited for him to indicate that he wanted more, and he did- so we tickled and laughed the energy out instead. Tickles quickly turned into sleepy back scratching, and my son was asleep in 10 minutes.\n\nAnyway, I thought about the interaction afterward and realized that I hadn't had to make a conscious decision to work to remain calm and regulated. My body and mind just did it like it was second nature, and found a way to help him regulate too. I think it's so cool that I'm at a point in my healing where I'm finally the parent I needed as a child, and I just wanted to share with someone. I think my therapist might be right that I am ready.

    "selftext": "So this week, my insecurities around therapy have been through the roof, and I decided to finally take the “old reliable” advice of the sub and actually talk to my therapist about it. I wrote a list of every question I wanted to ask them but haven’t out of fear that they’d abandon me.\n\nOh my god. I finally think I trust my therapist. They were so understanding about everything, and I really just need to gush about it. \n\nOne thing I said was “I’m scared of opening up to you because I worry that you’ll suddenly decide that we’re no longer a good fit, and you’ll terminate me.” They responded and said that if they gave up on every client the second a client had complicated problems, they would not be a good therapist, and would probably have already quit. They said that nothing I have brought is too much for them, and that they would only refer me out if I needed 24/7 care that they would not be able to give to me.\n\nI also brought up how scared I was that, due to my flexible schedule, I never have a set time each week, and that because I don’t have that consistent time and day, I am extremely replaceable, and that someday, you just will magically not have any room for me, and I’ll have to find someone else. They told me that they greatly appreciate my flexibility, and that most of their schedule is already completely booked with set times because a lot of people only have one hour a week that works, and that I actually make it possible for other clients to have the option for rescheduled spots. They said that their weekly clients have priority, and my spot isn’t going anywhere. This made me feel so good, and extinguished any doubts about that.\n\nI brought up things they said that hurt my feelings. They were so understanding and gave me the room I needed to be upset. They explained their thought process, but not in a defensive way. They expressed how they could have done things differently, and that they were sorry. This is the first time in my life I have had someone show me what positive conflict can look like.\n\nI also went for it and asked “the big question”, which is “do you enjoy working with me, and if so, why?” \n\nTo my surprise, they said that they do. To combat my skepticism, they said that the reason they do is because they appreciate how insightful I am, and how much work I put in to get better, even if I don’t see that. They said that the issues I bring are the exact areas they became a therapist to help with, and that they see a lot of themselves in me. This meant so much to me. I pretty much wrote down verbatim what they said in my journal so I can reread it whenever I get sad or insecure.\n\nI’ve had an up and down relationship with therapy because I’m very self conscious and anxious, and that shows up in therapy, and I don’t like it. I know everyone here says to bring the stuff that scares you the most into your session, and now I finally understand why. Go for it. It’s seriously SO helpful, and I’m so excited for what’s next.\n\n(also if my therapist is reading this, I appreciate you a lot! Thanks for not getting sick of me!!)",

Your therapist is your therapist and has no other role in your life. That hour or so a week is a kind of sacred space that exists on another plane almost. \n\nThat hour is a safe, caring place of acceptance where you can be yourself totally and recieve care and protection from another human being. That's what allows you to explore things and resolve the past and make new choices for the future. The protection of that hour with good boundaries is what makes it so special and allows the healing to work, allows you to grow and make brave and difficult changes. \n\nAnything that risks eroding that is inherently harmful in my opinion. \n\nPlus there's all the practical side of it. There's so much room for misunderstanding in that kind of communication that if its extended texting its almost inevitable. A lot is lost even on video calls because of missed body language cues and the lack presence. It's just not effective.\n\nIt's got to dilute the therapists ability too, there's no way they can focus on a full case load and be expected to reply to emotionally loaded texts all the time. It will badly effect the standard of care they can provide for everyone. \n\nObviously some people need more intensive support at times but that's more nursing care that's about immediate safety and should really be the work of a specialist crisis service ideally with medical support. \n\nThere's no way regular therapists can provide this kind of service and communication without it being dangerous for everybody involved. Any therapist that tells you any different is selling snake oil. When it comes down to it people's lives are stake here and its so upsetting to keep seeing these kinds of things over and over again. Better help and talk space and all these other charlatans really need indicting tbh. It's incredibly unethical. \n\nStay safe out there please everybody. I honestly love the lot of yous on here. We all just trying to be better people and get through difficult times. I'm with you. I get you. I understand.

    "selftext": "I read quite a few posts on here and got the impression that people sometimes struggle with feeling uneasy during sessions. \"My therapist made me feel uncomfortable\" - and often people mainly support OP and paint the therapists as unprofessional, at least question their actions without knowing much of the context.\n\nTherapy is not simply about making you feel good. Not feeling great during and after sessions does not mean the therapist is bad at their job. Therapy is about creating a safe space where you feel like you can express yourself and *get challenged*. Getting challenged is not the same as simply getting judged. It is not about just making you feel good, validating you/your feelings. It is work, can be nasty, make you cry, hate your therapist, yourself, most everyone around you - to eventually make sense of underlying feelings and find ways for dealing with them in a constructive way in everyday life.\n\nA well working therapy is not just given - it is established over time, created through the work of both parties involved. Communication in terms of goals and expectations is key. \n\nNot every therapist can work with any client and vice versa. Some need hard hitting therapists who don't use a lot fluff but get to the point real fast (can be brutal). Others prefer more gentle, slower approaches. It is ok to look for a better fit if it does not work out, but I have seen too many times how clients stick with a therapist they \"love\" mainly because they \"validate\" the client's feelings no matter what. The result is a weekly session of \"everyone is horrible around me\" with the therapist nodding and expressing sympathy while, fundamentally, nothing changes for the client.\n\nThe focus is on the client. You have issues with your therapist? Be honest with yourself, talk to them about it, understand the causes for the issues, look for solutions together. The issues cannot be resolved? End the professional relationship, move on (with or without a new therapist).\n\nTherapy can suck but in the long run it hopefully will provide you with insights in your behavior and tools which allow for creating a more fulfilling life based on your own actions.",

Part of doing that job at all adequately is taking a curious and non-judgmental stance. Only a very incompetent and inappropriate therapist would be silently condemning their client for talking too much, talking too little, being too fat/ugly/poor/stupid, having insignificant problems, or whatever else YOU are projecting onto them.\n\n(I’m sure someone will pipe up here with the exception—yes, there are bad therapists. Not the point.)\n\nTherapists may disagree with you. They may set limits and refuse to condone behaviors. But they are not sitting around being petty judging you so own your shame and don’t let it control your therapy. They just genuinely want to help.",

    "selftext": "\"What if I had never wrote you those emails?\" asking my therapist in yesterday session.  \n\n\"I probably wouldn't feel connected to you, and have a great affection for you.  In those emails, you showed me who you really are.\" he answered, after giving it a thought.\n\nDuring the first three months of weekly session, I hardly spoke in complete sentences.  I couldn't explain my problems properly aside from saying \"I don't know\", because in the back of my mind, there were just too many issues, but at the same time, they weren't seem important enough to be addressed.  And I didn't know him well and I didn't trust him.  So most of the time I left the session feeling unheard and misunderstood.  Sometimes, I would be angry at myself for not being able to talk, and felt like I wasted both my money and time just sitting in my therapist office, and being silent for more than half of the session.  I could see that my therapist was being frustrated too, as he didn't know what he could do to help me.\n\nAnd then there was one time, I left his office feeling so terrible that I really needed to talk to him, and I sent him the first email, telling him my feelings and thoughts in great details, and I ended the email saying that he didn't have to reply, and we could talk about it in the following session.  I felt better, pressing the \"sent\" button.  The next day, he replied to my thoughts and thanked me twice for the email.  He told me that I helped him to understand me better.\n\nSince that time, in addition to our weekly session, I wrote to him (with his consent) regularly about my childhood, my concerns and insecurities, my feelings for him (as a father figure), sexual fantasies and my other deepest darkest thoughts.  All are topics that related to what we had discussed in therapy sessions.  He never starts a email conversation, but he always replies to my emails, and when he doesn't have time, he would still write back and let me know that he had read my email carefully, and we would talk about it in sessions.\n\nUp to this day (been seeing him for almost three years), there are still topics that I have trouble talking about, and saying some particular words out loud would cause me to zone out immediately, but as I had mentioned them in the emails, now he can tell what was happening to me when I just stopped talking and froze, and he knows how to \"bring me back\".  The more he knows about me, the better he learned to adjust his therapeutic approach to match my needs, which I'm so grateful for.\n\nI understand that not many therapist would do emails, as they may not have the time to reply all the emails, or there could be misinterpretation on the tone and intensions behind the messages (this can be resolved by bringing up the negative feelings that I had or ask for a clarification in sessions).  But for me, thanks to those email conversations, I build a great rapport with my therapist, and my therapist also let me know that \"I am so honored and touched\" that I trust him enough to let him into my world.\n\nI know this is long, and thank you for reading this.  I just feel like sharing my talk therapy experience with you guys.\n\nEdit: typo",

    "selftext": "I know this is just what my psychologist calls my sensitivity around invalidation but it really spikes my anxiety and distress when I see posts from mental health professionals claiming DID doesn't exist. It does exist, just not like it's portrayed in the media. I have it and without an SSRI to calm my anxiety, I'm terrified of it, of having parts of me that can take over my body and say and do things I disagree with. \n\nI didn't self-diagnose, I'd never even heard of it when I started therapy for something else entirely. When I did some trauma processing with my psychologist, it brought out a part of me that has been so buried for so long I sometimes didn't know who my friends were, how to do my job, and was afraid of things I don't normally think twice about like the dark, baths, and sleeping in a bed. Thank God my psychologist, despite never having treated someone with DID, recognized my dissociation when I had no memory of doing it and could help me. Because if one of these skeptical clinicians was my treatment provider, I'd probably be in a hospital getting worse instead of better, on anti-psychotic medication that wouldn't work because I'm dissociative, not psychotic.\n\nTo any therapists reading this, please believe me that DID exists. Just because kids fake it on Tik Tok doesn't mean some of us don't really suffer with it. I couldn't fake this shit if I tried. Nor would I want to. I'm doing much better now, able to work again, not so scared of my parts anymore, and even dipping my toes in an intimate relationship (something I've rarely been able to do), all because my psychologist recognized it and my healthcare team believed him. It's better to treat a hundred fakers as if they have DID than miss one who does have it and you wanted to not be fooled. It is so damaging to read about the skepticism - these types of posts made me really scared to talk to my therapist about my symptoms for a long time because I thought he wouldn't believe me. I didn't know he'd already seen me switch many times. I could go on, but I'll stop here.",

I mean, it seems to me, the first thing therapy is supposed to be is to be to help people who are *ill*, in need of *help*, and above-all-else: *trauma*. The fact that so few therapists are actually trained in trauma, and know how to deal with it, really perturbs me. \n\nI'm not denying that mental illness can't be improved with *coping skills*, but when did that become the end-all-be-all of therapy? I've tried that route excessively, and all it has done is ended me up more traumatized because the topic of my trauma - on the few times I dared to actually try to get into it - has been a non-topic for the therapists, or their responses to it were far from helpful and tended to focus on finding a way to either blame me or disbelief I didn't want it to happen in some way (wtf). \n\nI guess I just needed a moment to rant. I don't understand the state of therapy, or psychoanalysis at this point, in all their different modalities and presentations. The fact that 95% of therapists on psychologytoday list themselves as willing and/or knowledgable to work *only* with more basic symptomology (e.g. anxiety, depression, relationship problems) with 4% listing every damn thing available on the website, and leaving 1% who list trauma/ptsd as something they're willing/knowledgable to work with, is aggravating to say the least. It seems to me that people with mental health issues are going to have trauma... Minor trauma, moderate trauma, or extreme trauma, but we *all* have some level of trauma. What is a therapist if not an expert in trauma? I don't understand this! It feels like the profession is a mess from every modality as far as I can tell if trauma is not the primary focus to *begin with* and if - even worse - clients are treated like they are, and may well have always been the problem, and the reason for their trauma, instead of seeing their symptomology as coming from the trauma. At least for myself, all my resistances/defenses flair because I walk into a room that goes, \"Well, what's wrong with *you*\" instead of first wondering \"What went wrong in your life to have such an impact *on you*?\"\n\nI'm not dismissing that we're the only ones who can do anything about our situations/health/reactions - name it what you want - but the prevailing perspective I've come across is a sense of no matter what modality I approach, the point is to always get to a point in the \"treatment\" where the expectation is to make me accountable which - for trauma like my own - only pervasively instills the trauma that I was initially subjected to and led to a sense of not deserving anything better than what I got, and if I think I do (like now), I'm a horrible person who deserves even less for thinking I deserve better.

My therapist said, \"So, you look up to her, and she has helped you, but it is a relationship that started professionally and you don't know if telling her you love her will turn her away whatever kind of relationship it is you two now have,\" (she's suggested I ask my professor what kind of relationship it is we have now but fk that is a scary and awkward talk) and she was smiling a bit saying this and I realized we were explicitly talking about one relationship while implicitly talking about us. I said, \"I'm worried she'll think I *love* love her if I tell her\" (growing up as a lesbian, I was always accused of liking other girls and have faced a good amount of homophobia...it is hard making friends when friendly intentions are misconstrued as flirtatious), and Dr. \\*\\*\\*\\*\\* said, \"Well, cmon, she's certainly mature enough to understand!\" and I also said, \"Well, I think she knows I love her, in the same way I know she loves me, so she's just waiting for me to mature and find myself and find the courage to say it, you know what I mean?\" and my therapist said yes, she did now what I meant, and she looked very amused, and again I felt like it wasn't just me and my professor I was talking about. \n\nFast forward to next session and I'm feeling great about life. I tell my therapist how much love I feel for the world and myself, how great it is waking up not crippled by PTSD, how I don't feel the urge to smoke weed or drink alcohol, and am even losing the urge to use psychedelics so often. I tell her how I would not have found my way if it weren't for those who love me. We start listing people who have helped me and who I love, and she thinks it is very funny, saying things like, \"Well let's see there's your friends, your fiancee, your professor...\" and I know what I'm supposed to say, and what I want to say, so I interrupted her and said, \"You too, Dr. \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*, you've helped me so much just because you wanted to and I love your kindness and efforts and abilities!\" (I couldn't actually say \"I love you,\" too scary!) and Dr. \\*\\*\\*\\*\\* looked as happy as I felt and she said, and thanked me for what I said, and said \"I love you too \":). She also said she has learned from me just as much as I've learned from her. I had no idea a therapist could tell their patient that, but I've never been to therapy before so this has been a very interesting and unique dynamic in my life that I am glad has turned out this way. I'd always suspected we have a healthy therapist-client relationship so I'm glad she could trust me with these powerful words. I'm lucky to have found such a great therapist so quickly—somehow I seem to surround myself with great people.\n\nIn all, it was a good session but shit, I still gotta tell my professor I love her. We zoomchat every week so hopefully this week I don't chicken out!",

He controlled me and I was close to taking my own life. Thankfully, I was able to gain some strength and break contact with him. I'm back in therapy and I have a long way to go. No, I haven't reported him yet, I'm scared to go through the process and I still blame myself, thinking I got him to that point of no return. In time, I'm hoping to trust this therapist and maybe I'll be able to go through with the heartache. \n\nPoint is, I understand boundaries can be strict, but IT IS for your own good. I was just like many of you, wanting to be closer to my therapist, wanting to be his friend, wanting to be more, but that's not the way it's supposed to be. \n\nIf you ever end up having an intimate relationship with your therapist, it's already doomed, there's no other way around it. And any therapist who's willing to take that step is insane or a psychopath.\n\nEDIT: Thank you for your kind words and to those who shared their experience as well, I hope you all find peace. I also want to thank you for respecting my decision not to report him just yet. I can understand if that's difficult to read, but it's a lot harder than you think.",

I’ve been sitting on this for a while very scared of how things would go if I ever told my T about the sexual thoughts I had about her even though I knew it was just transference and they weren’t really about her specifically. I didn’t wanna lose what has been the best therapist I’ve ever had. \n\nAnyway I started super vaguely (freakin terrified) and she said I didn’t have to be more specific if I didn’t want to but she really thought with all the work we’ve done so far, I could push myself a little here. So I did and I was clear about what I actually thought about her sometimes. I was sobbing. I told her it’s totally ok if she never wants to talk to me again or if she needs time to think about whether she wants to. I apologized profusely. I didn’t want her to think I was objectifying her or trying to break boundaries or something like that. \n\nShe took it super well. I didn’t look at her and asked her not to look directly at me til I was done. When I finally worked up the nerve for us to look at each other, she was smiling. She said she was really glad I told her and that she wasn’t going to leave or tell anyone or treat me any differently. She said that I did a really good job and she understood how lonely and painful that must have been for me to not be able to talk to her about it until now. \n\nWe’ve already started processing some of the feelings behind it. She said some of what’s coming up for me behind it is stuff she’s been waiting for me to realize for a long time and sometimes transference is just what it takes to get there. \n\nI did a crazy hard thing today and I’m so tired but I really feel so much better now that I did it.

    "selftext": "This sucks.\n\nI'm 30F. He's 30M. Been seeing him twice a week for near 18 months. Worked through some difficult stuff, healed A LOT. I'm intensely grateful to him for all of that help. \n\nUnfortunately, in the process, I fell in love with him. Before you jump to transference, we have already discussed this at length. I have broken down, identified, and talked out my feelings. I know and trust myself well enough now to understand the difference.  It's grief now and acceptance that's in my future.\n\nOn Monday, we had a deeply emotional session where I revealed the depth of my feelings. We both cried. A lot. He is of course the consummate professional and was very adept at keeping the focus on me even though we were both so emotional. \n\nI just had another session with him. I... don't know. I don't think I can continue. I want to talk to him as a person and actual friend - not my therapist. Please don't try to explain to me how \"we don't know each other\". I'm well aware of the dynamic. But in session today all I could feel was deep anger and hurt. \n\nI expected to go through healing, I expected this to be tough when I started, I knew it would be hard. I never expected this. Ever. I've also never experienced this with another therapist. Or person for that matter! I thought I was in love before. I've been in relationships. But I straight up love this man. Like... Full stop.\n\nAnd there's nothing I can do about it and he can only talk to me as a therapist. Yes, it would be helpful for him to straight up reject me so I can hear it and move on. But he won't and I don't want to elongate feelings of yearning or pining. I also now feel closed off to him. I only ever saw him as a person providing a service and I feel that's done now. I've been thinking about decreasing my sessions for a while now. \n\nThen this came out and I really really laid down my feelings - I was very vulnerable with him, to an extent I probably wouldn't have if I didn't have feelings. He owes me nothing but I'm hurt that he couldn't put the therapist aside for just a moment and talk to me person to person. He's doing his job and honestly that's all I could ask for. I guess I lost sight of the fact that I am just work to him and even though he cares about me as his client - that's all I'll ever be. \n\nI feel stupid and small and like a naive child. It's embarrassing in a way. I'm angry about the whole thing and I just don't want to see him anymore. I'm hurt. Sure I could work through this. But to what end? I get over my feelings and then...? Keep working on what? So sick of this fucking merry go round - I need a break. \n\n",

It was about asking for the second time in 2 years to increase my session frequency, and being told vaguely by my T \"I'll hold it in mind\" both times. The first time I asked, she completely forgot. And I was worried it was going to happen again.\n\nWell I went to my next session and I was too timid to tell her how it made me feel. We had a session talking about how people always forgot my birthday, and even as a child my birthday got ignored by my parents. I realised that in childhood people just couldn't hold me in mind. I worked out why my therapists exact words \"I'll hold it in mind\" hurt so much when she ultimately forgot about my request. \n\nI was ruminating on this when out of the blue on a Friday afternoon she emails me and offers me 2 sessions a week, with the 2nd session fitting perfectly into my work schedule, without me even having to ask my boss for reasonable adjustments. \n\nI went to therapy today and we finally talked about what had happened between us, and she said that there had been a huge enactment, and she owned her part in it amd said sorry. She acknowledged that her words meant something deeply significant for me, when for her it was a figure of speech. And she said she shouldn't have left me hanging like that. \n\nMy goodness it's been a roller-coaster.  But I really value her and I'm looking forward to our continued work together. ",

What I found left me in awe. She's a big-time journalist, has an instagram page, does modeling, human rights activist, and is a board of directors member of a company. She has a fulfilling life- excelling in every part. I'm impressed by all she has achieved, but at the same time, I can't help but feel bad about myself. I'm at most good at my job.\n\nI can only afford her, because of her cheap rates. She subsidizes it, so money is going out of her pocket. I know for a fact, that she doesn't need my money, since doing therapy is a thing on the side for her. This has been a blow to my self-esteem and anxieties.\n\nShe also had a very traumatic past. My issues pale in comparison. I know I shouldn't but I kind of feel betrayed- not her fault at all. I finally start opening myself up to a person and being vulnerable. They turn out to be a huge deal. It's intimidating.\n\nHer life is just perfect, with or without me. People here ask if their therapist cares about them. I don't think mine does, or has to. This has put my self-worth in jeopardy. I'm questioning my purpose, and what I have achieved so far. Everything I've worked towards is for myself. I've nothing, worth showing off, that I've done for others.\n\nFunny thing is, you discuss something like this with your therapist, but in my case, my therapist is the reason for my anxiety.

    "selftext": "My therapist is great otherwise, but there is one boundary I feel is being overstepped, and I think it would be her job to fix it. The sessions are supposed to be 50 minutes, each starting on the hour. The therapy room is way up at the top of a flight of stairs, and the waiting room is at the bottom, so if you wait for your session in the waiting room, there is no way you could hear the other person's session. \n\nAnyway, my T almost always makes my session 55-60 minutes, which is very generous of her, but I have noticed that when we end on the dot, her next client is already at the door of the therapy room, which has a window and is not soundproof. I was thinking, that's totally justified, her time start at the beginning of the next hour. So today I decided to voluntarily leave at 10.50. I didn't bring up anything else to talk about after 45, I let her round down the session, thanked her, and stood up at 50. She asked me like 2 more questions, and by the time I went out the door, it was 53.... and the next client was there 😒\n\nI am thinking I will tell her A. I would prefer it if we finished precisely at 50 and B. I really, really, REALLY don't want her next client waiting outside the door at the end of my session. I really need to be guaranteed that I will be leaving at 50, and the next client won't come up the stairs until 55 at the earliest. Does that sound like a reasonable boundary to ask of my therapist?\n\nEditing to add, thanks for all the helpful comments! 🙂 Just to clarify, the session is officially 50 minutes, not 60, and not 53 for billing purposes, but so many of you said, setting my boundary does not have to involve me sticking to the 50 minute mark, it would be enough to tell her I don't want the next client waiting outside at the end of my session. If she then decides that ending precisely at 50 is the best solution for this, that's fine, but it's her job to fix the problem. I guess I was just being too modest, assuming I don't have a right to that extra time, but thanks for the reminder that even though obviously I'm not entitled to it, my first step shouldn't be to cut back my own session. Privacy should be guaranteed regardless of when the therapist ends the session. \n\nI don't know what the joking around comment was because thankfully a mod removed it, but please don't. I, like so many others, am in therapy for trauma. I'm not here to provide joke material for anyone.\n\nThanks again for all the helpful support!\n\nEditing again to say thank you for the award!! 🙂💜💜💜\n\nUpdate I talked to her about it in session yesterday, and she kinda rolled her eyes and laughed when mentioned the next client being at the top of the stairs uninvited lol 😂 And she said of course, she will tell all her clients to wait downstairs, I don't need to worry about that. Huge relief. Thank you for the support again guys, have a wonderful day. 💜",

I did what many here have done, I searched Google, found him on Facebook... I did a lot of things I was not proud of. I drove by his home, more than once. I looked at Facebook likes and discovered where his kids went to school and played sports and some of his friends, and I scanned those pages every few days to see if any update included him in any way . I recorded telehealth sessions without him knowing and I would listen to them between sessions. I thought about what it would be like to have a relationship with him. I spent a lot of time thinking about him and during our sessions I would try to make him laugh or impress him.\n\nBad, right? I had been looking at my therapist with rose-colored glasses. I had put him on a pedestal. I had idolized him.\n\nBut as we spent more time together, in video sessions and then at his office, I started to see things I didn't like. Listening to sessions again and again,  made me realize that he had trained phrases he often repeated. I saw him drinking a soda I don't like. I passed his car in the parking lot and saw trash inside. He made a joke and I didn't think it was funny, and his laugh was odd. I started to realize... he was just a person, with flaws and idiosyncrasies and he even was a little bit *weird* and uncool. What I thought was an attractive face and body I realized actually was average, and that he had even put on weight during the lockdown.\n\nI still see him. He's a great therapist. I did tell him some of the things I had done, and we worked through it. Now, instead of spending my time doing eye makeup and wearing low-cut shirts and telling funny and impressive stories during sessions, I just show up.\n\nI am not sure if my story is similar to anyone else's here, but for those of who you are having these obsessive thoughts...

(7/23/23) i asked her what days she could meet this week. keep in mind, she always replies very quick. less than a couple hours quick. so like normal she replied right away and told me that we could meet this friday. as in today. (7/28/23). i emailed her back quickly and asked her what time on friday would work best for her. now here’s where i notice something was off. a day went by and there was no reply. weird but not anything too crazy. i figured maybe she was still on vacation and that she was busy. it made sense. maybe she decided to stay an extra day. she was visiting her family in her home town. but then i thought it was a bit strange when yesterday i still hadn’t heard back from her. she had told me that she would be back in town by monday. and i still hadn’t heard anything. but i didn’t stress it. i knew life gets busy and that i’m sure she’ll reply when she has a chance to. so this morning i woke up. immediately checking my email in hopes she had replied saying a time she could meet today or an email asking to reschedule. instead i see an email. the subject is “a heartfelt message regarding the passing of our beloved therapist, my therapist’s name.” to say i was in shock is a pure understatement. i still am. it feels unreal. i have sobbed for majority of the day. and my heart aches. i feel lost. i found out later today that she died from a tragic car accident. my heart hurts so bad. my therapist was amazing and a beyond incredible person. i’m not sure i have the right words and am still in a great amount of shock and grief. i wanted to just ask for other people’s advice on navigating through this and if anyone else has a similar experience or even if you don’t, any advice you could share with me.\n\nedit: i wanted to thank everyone for commenting and taking the time to read my post. i have never experience such support and love like this before. i hadn’t expected anyone to even reply. this community has brought so much peace and comfort during this difficult time for me. thank you to everyone. i have been re-reading the comments over and over again. they help more than anything else. thank you everyone. i am at a bit of a loss for words because of the amount of appreciation and love i have for everyone. i will be seeing a therapist monday and am taking everyone’s advice. thank you for all of the support. 🤍🤍",

    "selftext": "I’ve seen too many people get told that the transference they’re experiencing is an embarrassing problem that needs to be hidden and fixed before the therapist finds out. \n\n**Transference cannot be controlled.** In fact, many therapists believe that transference is necessary in the therapeutic process. \n\nI want to make the point that many clients who’s problems fall outside abuse, PDs, and other trauma disorders, may not experience attachment issues and therefore may not experience transference. However, for the clients who have had their trust broken by their caregivers, therapists should *expect* them to experience transference as a sign the therapeutic relationship is growing.\n\nWhile many therapists specialize in depression or anxiety, there are therapists who specialize in working with individuals who are expected to experience deep transference. Violating boundaries is a major problem, but things like researching your therapist and saving public photos of your therapist, does not fall into this category. \n\nIn todays world, therapists are taught to expect clients to research them, and one can find a lot of information online. Accessing this public information is not “crossing boundaries”. But it is important to be able to discuss this with your therapist. \n\nIt’s abnormal for people to be researching and dreaming about near strangers, but what we forget, is that attachment issues is an **abnormal situation**. It would be wrong for therapists and others to expect clients to not access public information. It is the therapist’s job to set and regulate their boundaries, including what information they put out there. \n\nOn another note, some clients may experience romantic or sexual transference that may be a result of attractiveness of the therapist rather than trauma. This is something that cannot be controlled. Some therapists, especially newer therapists, may be uncomfortable with this. While it is the therapist’s call on what happens after this is discussed, I would like to advise clients on this sub that myself and MANY therapists understand that this is normal and you mean no harm. \n\n**Disclaimer:** This post is about no one in particular and is not meant to criticize therapists who are uncomfortable working with clients who experience heavy transference.

A person who can say things like \"take into consideration that you consented to sexual activity, it's a risk doing that with a stranger\" and \"a lot of men don't hear no until you say it very forcefully\" whatever that means and \"what could you have done differently in that situation\" in a situation where I very clearly did everything I could, and \"I don't like the term sexism. Everybody has their own unique story\" is not a person I will be able to trust in the process of dealing with my childhood sexual harrassment trauma. Her mysoginy is so deeply internalized, that I wouldn't even know where to begin if I had to explain to her what is wrong with this kind of thinking, and I am especially not willing to or feeling able to continue to pay her so that I can either educate her on these issues, or continue to try to express my own issues while continuously being censored to fit her comfort zone. I don't feel like this is an impulsive response anymore, I feel like this is reality. Not just for me, but for a lot of other people who do not have the privilege to fit into a worldview a lot of, sadly even therapists view as default, without being a silent casualty to it. I realize I have a lot of privilege myself just for being able to go to therapy, but if I can go, I will not continue to be gaslit to fit this world that has been constructed to be comfortable for some and \"just bear it\" for others. I will not be told just to bear it by a mental health professional.\n\nI don't want advice, just wanted to put that out there.\n\nEDIT: Thanks so much for all you supportive commenters 💜 Normally, on most topics, I don't mind being challenged either, but on this, it's pretty sensitive to me so I'm not reading any of the \"devil's advocate\" type comments (ie the ones downvoted below zero) Thanks for understanding!",

    "title": "My Therapist left and wouldn't accept my letter so I'm posting it here",
    "selftext": "This might end up being long, but I need to get it out. Thanks in advance for sticking with me!\n\nA little background: My childhood is littered with state-required counselors that get a little close and then leave their placement to accept positions in better paying / non-city jobs. This was a major hurdle we worked on overcoming in therapy. We began in person sessions but transitioned to phone therapy d/t COVID. My t of a little over a year announced he was moving out of state (going back home) a few months ago. It was devastating and I felt he understood the impact it would have. We worked on it. He asked that I stay in sessions to have \"a good good-bye\" and not just a \"well, I have new job so I'm leaving and 'blank' will be coming to see you next week\" or no good-bye at all.\n\nSo I stuck with it. It was hard. Last session was Tuesday. I wrote things down I wanted to tell him, and asked him questions I never would have asked if therapy were continuing (\"Do you think you will forget me?,\"  \"How old are you?\") and at the very end asked if I could please give him a gift and a letter. I had a spiel about how it wasn't monetarily significant and that I'd very much like him to have this. He said yes. I said I would drop it at the front desk and he said okay.\n\nAt the end of my day (we work at the same place) I went to the psych building to drop it off. Doors were locked. Security came out. Stated the provider himself would have to come down for it. I called the front desk from my car, tried to arrange drop off. They are not allowed to accept things at the front desk, and no they won't come down for it. Anyway - sent a message to my T through the provider network, he called the next day and said to come over, it's all worked out. Nope. Same rules. Now the options are 1: give it to the security guard who will \"make sure it gets to him\" or 2: T comes down for it (a flight of steps and a door). I wrote T telling him I wasn't comfortable dropping it off with a person who doesn't work for the psych office. He said \"sorry we couldn't find a way. Thank you for your thoughtfulness. Good luck in your endeavors.\"\n\nOuch. I feel like that was incredibly mean. I wrote back: \"Well there is a way. You could come down a flight of steps and open a door and I could hand it to you. Thank you for elucidating that it's not worth that amount of effort on your part. No need to reply.\"\n\nHere's my letter, at least it's out here in the universe and not sitting like a lump in my throat accumulating the debris of shame and embarrassment.\n\n\"Dear Paul,\n\nOne day, my daughter gave me a flower before I left for work. I thanked her and she said, “It’s so you will remember me.” As if I could ever forget her. But now I know what that must have felt like for her: so maybe this is me also saying: please don’t forget me. Formally, please accept this gift on behalf of a grateful patient.\n\nWhen I was a kid, we moved around a lot, but when the family finally settled in ..., it was near a town called .... There, Moravian stars adorn the porches and windows and Christmas trees in the parts of town where you would be happy to go home at night. There were lights in the winter and lush gardens in the warmer months.\n\nTo me, Moravian stars mean warmth and acceptance and hope. They make me think of warm breezes, scented with ... honeysuckle, that play across bare skin in endless summer nights. In short: a home. Had there been a happy childhood, it would have been there. It’s where I would have wanted it to be. This star was handmade in ....\n\nThank you for providing me with a place I can land on. Beyond speaking to my psychological needs… You are aware that I have had multiple counselors, therapists, and state-sanctioned expert guidance. Two people have been effective: Dr. ... at ..., and Dr. Paul ... at .... Please understand that the aforementioned effectiveness you both provided was life-changing. I was a .... for years before Dr. .... I didn’t know how to **feel** before Dr. Paul ... . The work begun with you is not finished, but it’s a start.\n\nLife-changing.\n\nI carry love in my heart for you always, and I wish that you find happiness and peace back home – take a little bit of my home back with you.\n\nIt is not simply the training that makes a good therapist. It’s not.\n\nYou have a spark.\n\nLight the world up, Paul. One person at a time.\n\nWith love,\n\n...\"\n\nAnd I'm just a little heartbroken that I wasn't worth the effort to walk down some steps and let me give these to him. And also maybe I was wrong about him and how stupid I am to think these things. Anyway. I'm struggling. This is such a mind bending experience. I don't know what to do with myself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Thanks so much for all your support. It means the world to me. To be validated rather than the \"What did you expect?\" tape that's rolling in my head is such a relief. Thank you, thank you, thank you.\n\nClarity: the rules about not coming into the office / not having front desk staff accepting things is because of COVID.\n\nThere was a gift with the letter, but it was discussed in the last session re: monetary value being less than a certain amount and it putting me under no hardship. It was stressed that the letter was parting thoughts and expressions I wouldn't be able to get through on the phone without breaking down.\n\nFor those saying \"mail the letter,\" thanks for your input! But he's moving out of state and while I know the state, I don't know where his new position is / not going to look it up and it feels like he's already rejected it. I don't know why I would put myself in this position again.\n\nEDIT 2: \n\nI wanted to give a final \"thank you\" for all the support. It has truly helped me begin to move past this. I'm so very touched. <3\n\n\" You'll be given love, you'll be taken care of   \nMaybe not from the sources you have poured yours  \nMaybe not from the directions you are staring at\n\nTwist your head around, it's all around you\n\nAll is full of love.\" -Bjork\n\nI went looking and I found it. Thank you, you're all beautiful souls. ",

    "selftext": "(tw: abuse and misconduct)\n\nI'm aware this might be a sensitive topic but I also wanted to ask for advice or stories for what I'm undergoing. I've (26M) been a sexually and emotionally abusive person to my past relationships, friends, people around me and most recently, a longtime friend who studied where I worked. It was sexual misconduct.\n\nI was confronted by the latter on my behaviour so I quit my job and entered therapy to deal with all the BS that's been in me for the longest time. I accept everything I've done and I'm doing whatever I can to get better and never harm anyone again.\n\nTherapy has been great at unlocking a lot of things in me, identifying bad behaviours and my own past traumas as well but I'm still struggling to see how a person can even grow beyond this. I used to (and still do somewhat) hold the worldview that abusers (especially sexual) are unforgivable unless it was a one-off occurrence where you immediately went to deal with the issue. That's not the same for me where this has happened repeatedly and I was in denial of my own behaviours until the worst happened.\n\nI guess I wanted to come here and ask if any others have been through this: an abusive person who entered therapy. Did it work? What happened to you? Where are you now? How did you get through it?",

    "title": "Had a breakthrough. Feel relieved. Wanted to share.",
    "selftext": "Hi. 34(M) here.\n\nIn March I booked my first ever therapy session. I was very dismissive of therapy before, but shortly after my 34th birthday I had to accept that I needed external help and guidance.\n\nMy mom has had 3 strokes. Prior to her strokes she, although affectionate and caring, wasn't the easiest person to deal with. Whenever I tried to leave home and try to live by myself she would somehow be able to convince or manipulate me into staying. When she had those strokes in the span of 2 years I felt trapped. She started having mood swings that eventually just turned into whining, started blaming me for not being able to find doctors that would \"fix\" her, give her back her lost hearing, constantly telling that all the doctors are idiots and I'm an idiot too for believing them that she needs speech and language therapy when it's obvious she just needs to get her ears cleaned or the right medicine prescribed.  \nAbout a year ago I even weighed all the pros and cons of taking my life. At one point it felt like I was an observer watching two parts of my mind trying to decide whether I should continue to live or should just end it all.  \nOne day I was in the kitchen and my mom started playing all the greatest hits, including \"Why has this happened to me?\", \"Why are all the doctors idiots?\", \"Why can't you find somebody who can help me?\". I broke and just yelled  \nSHUT YOUR F\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* MOUTH!  \nWHAT?  \nJUST SHUT UP! SHUT UP! SHUT UP! I DON'T WANT TO LIVE ANYMORE. I JUST WANT TO DIE!!!  \nShe was silent for a minute and then said:  \n\"It's all your own fault, you know. If you had a wife then she would be taking care of me right now and you wouldn't feel so overwhelmed, but no, you were always so picky! Oh, I don't like this one, that one's not cute enough!\"  \nAmazingly, that wasn't the moment I realized I needed therapy.  \nBtw, I didn't kill myself, if you hadn't guessed already. Eventually the responsible part of me said \"I'm sorry, but you can't. You just can't abandon your dog like that\". And after that all the thoughts of suicide disappeared.  \nShortly after I finally asked out a girl I had had a crush on for a year and life seemed a bit brighter and more bearable. Soon we'll be celebrating our 1 year anniversary.  \nIn March we celebrated my birthday and my gf's friend who's a pastry chef made 6 mochi cakes for me (3 flavors). I wanted to share them with my mom and my gf. I told my mom \"I want to share them with both of you. There are 2 ways to divide them. I take 3, and the rest can be divided in halves. Or I can slice each one into 3 equal parts, that way everybody'll get the same amount\". She said \"How about I get 3 full cakes and you and your gf can divide the rest whichever f\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* way you want? BECAUSE YOU CAN GO ON WALKS, GO TO CAFFEES, AND I CAN'T, I'M ALWAYS STUCK AT HOME! DOES THAT SEEM FAIR?!\". I said that it didn't seem fair to me, because they were my cakes, I could choose to eat all of them, but  I wanted to be nice and share them with people I care about.  \nThe next day a friend of mine came over and my mom acted all hurt and told her the mochi cakes story. \"AND THEN HE TOLD ME THAT IT WAS HIS BIRTHDAY AND IT WAS HIS GIFT! BUT WHO GAVE BIRTH TO HIM? I DID! I CREATED HIM! THEY ARE MY CAKES!\"  \nThat's when I booked a therapy session.\n\nMy therapist has been teaching me about boundaries, building and protecting them. He told me that generally there are 4 types of boundaries - physical, psychological, territorial and cultural. He shared some techniques to help me release anger and deal with anxiety in a way that is safe for me. When I heard about territorial boundaries I realised I didn't have them. I didn't have a lock on my door and my mom felt like she could come in any time she wanted. So I ordered a lock and installed it. It felt great. I felt safe.  \nI also told him that I've wanted to cry for the past 7 years but never could. I tried, but something was holding back the tears. The only time the dam opened was when my second dog died and I mourned her for 3 months. After that it shut again. He told me that I could always give myself permission to cry. And I did. But it didn't help.  \nFast forward to today.  \nHe asked me:  \nHow did your mother react to you putting in the lock?  \nKind of OK.  \nDid she say anything?  \nWell, kinda. She laughed a bit and then asked \"Didn't they have uglier locks to chose from?\"  \nAnd how did that make you feel?  \nA bit annoyed, but no biggie.  \nAnd her remark, what was it?  \nAn opinion.  \nWhat kind of opinion?  \nA negative one.  \nAnd what is a negative opinion?  \nA criticism, I guess.  \nMore like invalidation. She's invalidating all your efforts. Can you tell me what a child feels when he's being invalidated?  \nI don't know.  \nJohn (not my real name), let me tell you something on behalf of your mother. \"I'm really proud of you, son!\"\n\nAnd that's it. That's when the goddamn dam broke and all the hurt and all the tears from all those years came flooding out. And it felt SO GOOD! And after that I started laughing a bit hysterically. Trying to unlock those tears for all those years, not realising what I wanted to cry about, and the magic spell was so simple. I felt really elated after today's session. It was as if somebody had turned up the brightness on the world.\n\nIf anybody read up until this point, I want to thank you for your time. I really wanted to share this with somebody.",

    "title": "STUFF I WISH I KNEW... when I started therapy: Part I. Cyberstalking is Common",
    "selftext": "*It's been 2 and 1/2 years since I started therapy with Mister T. I've spent hundreds of hours in the same room with the same guy, which is* ***fricken weird*** *when you think about it (I wrote a post about the milestones of the weird first year of therapy, and may re-post that at some point, too.). I've learned a ton about the therapeutic relationship, and how to use therapy as the most effective tool possible. I've also had about a million humiliating moments that I thought made me a crazy person, that I later realized just made me a person. There's a ton of stuff I wish I knew when I started, and I want to share that with you guys. I know there are so many people on this thread who are just starting out. Gimme your questions, and I'll throw some of my experience back at you. Will I always be right? Hell no. But we can get a good discussion started.* \n\n**STUFF I WISH I KNEW... when I started therapy: Part I**\n\nCYBERSTALKING IS COMMON\n\nSo here's the deal, friends. I went through 3 different phases of cyberstalking Mister T, and I'm not afraid to admit it... now. Back then, I felt horrified, ashamed, scared, and like an all-around creep. But guess what? I wasn't. You're not, either. You're a curious, anxious, maybe lonely human using all the tools you have to feel safe, calm, and cared for. Here's how it went for me: \n\n**Phase 1. Pre-Appointment Research**\n\nI was matched with Mister T at random, and I sure as hell wanted to vet this guy out before telling him all of my deepest darkest trauma narratives. What did I know about him? His name, where he got his degree, where he worked, and... you know. That he was a therapist. But I've been around the online dating circuit people, so I'm *hella good at internet stalking.* I found out a lot about him. It wasn't that interesting, since Mister T doesn't have social media accounts, but it was, like, fine. No huge red flags. I decided to go ahead and carry through with the appointment I made with this random guy and see what happened. \n\n**Phase 2. The Deep Dive**\n\nA few sessions in, I was like: DUDE. I'm spilling my soul to this person, and the only thing I know about him is that he wears vests and likes duck art (yeah, like, duck paintings. Idk. It's whatever.) And I wanted more. Like, I wanted to feel like I *knew him* even though I know that's not technically what this is about. But it was covidtime, I was partially unhinged, and I wanted it, so I dove allll the way into the internet, people. I found a newspaper article about his wife, and a guitar album he recorded in college, and a picture of his family in his grandma's obituary, and a picture on a realtor website of him in front of the new house he bought. I found that he made a whole board of s'more recipes on Pinterest (and I tried some of them, duh.) I collected all the information I wanted like a crazy internet hacker from the 90s, guzzling coke and eating Doritos with an accelerated heart rate in some dark basement with X-File posters... you get the picture. I found a lot... and I felt like puking. And not just because of the s'mores.\n\n**Phase 3. Hanging Out With 2-D Mister T**\n\nEven though I wanted to puke, still, at varying intervals, I still visited these \"places\" on the internet. Because guess what? I was ISOLATED. Shit was TOUGH. I was LONELY and just needed some comfort. Sometimes, I just went to the therapy office's website and looked at Mister T's picture because somehow just reminding myself that he was real made me feel better about how hard things were. I oscillated through different web pages just to feel less alone. I knew this was weird... but was it that weird? We literally couldn't be with our friends or family. I was going through the hardest mental health year of my life. So if clicking through the blog posts my therapist wrote on the office blog made me feel like I could make it through another day, I was going for it. \n\nOver time, I felt like I needed these things a little less, just like I needed therapy a little less. Mister T taught me different strategies for coping with stress and grief and loneliness. I found new ways to seek comfort. And this took *work*, my dudes. It did NOT happen overnight. We're talking over a year. But things started to feel better. \n\nLet's address some FAQs:\n\n**Did you ever talk to Mister T about it?** \n\nNo. I chose not to. I felt guilty and gross sometimes when he'd disclose things about himself that I already knew, but I didn't want to use my therapy time to talk about my specific web searches. We talked about broader connected issues, like how I yearned for him to take care of me, and how I wanted to be with him in between sessions because his office felt safe. Those were very productive conversations, and addressed the deeper reasons why I was looking around cyberspace for his presence in the first place. \n\n**Am I going to jail?**\n\nGuess what, guys? Stuff on the internet... it's on the internet. It's not actually against the law to look people up. They could clean up their web presence if they were motivated, but the stuff that's left? You can look at it. You're not going to jail. But pay attention to how you feel, and what you do with the information you have. Does it feel like a breach of privacy? Evaluate that. Maybe it's how you would feel if someone did the same to you. Are you tempted to drive past their house? That's overstepping, and you can feel that in the pit of your stomach. Is this actually good for you? Journal it out. And if talking to your therapist would help, go for it. I admire your bravery. \n\n**We internet stalk our therapists because we're curious, vulnerable, lonely, and want to feel comforted, safe, and empowered.** None of this is wrong. But it can be helpful to take an introspective look at this behavior, how it makes you feel, and how it helps or hurts the work you're doing in therapy. \n\nBut my motivation for writing this post was to help people feel less ashamed and creepy, because you are in the company of a lot... a LOT of us who have done the same thing. You're ok. What you're doing is so common, and makes so much sense. Take a breath. You're ok. And I hope this post helped.",

He then said I made a Freudian slip and to continue with what I was saying. I continued to discuss my past sexual trauma, but then I said I felt awkward twice and didn't understand what I did or if I'm doing it now. He repeated it was a Freudian slip and to continue with what I was saying. 1 min later, he said the session was over due to time. I didn't sleep well that night and upon reflecting, I felt violated and didn't like how he handled the situation even if I was exposed (although I think it was physically impossible that I was). The next day, I e-mailed him I still felt awkward and did not want to continue with therapy because I felt uncomfortable. He replied back that he had asked me to raise my arm to lower my blouse so it would cover the exposed area and that he felt I would have wanted to know. I responded back that I was wearing a shirt that covered my entire chest and abdomen and didn't understand the logistics and told him that he should have offered an explanation as to what he saw before telling me to move my arm and explained what he meant by Freudian slip if he were to bring that up. There was no communication after that.   \n\n\nI feel this whole situation is weird and feel he did not care that I felt uncomfortable. If I thought I had exposed myself, I would have apologized and understood. But this whole thing didn't make sense to me. What are your thoughts?

We did not have insurance but agreed that we would be willing to pay an upfront fee until she did in a month, there was some urgency to get help as soon as possible.\n\nWe did some research and came across betterhelp. They offered fees as low as $35 with unlimited communication and also a 3 day trial. We decided to take the opportunity of the 3 day trial with promise of finding a therapist in 48 hours and possibly having one session. We soon found out that the 3 day trial only offered text messaging and it was impossible to have a session during the trial period because most therapists had booked schedules. We had no chance to really “trial” the service. When my partner found someone in the trial period a day later they quickly told her she had to find someone else. Which took another day. Not at all looking promising with what we saw advertised.\n\nWhen my partner had finally got a session with a therapist she was left in tears and absolutely distraught for the next few days. I said she should give the therapist a chance and she had another session and the same thing happened. After this second session her therapists advice was to break up with me and in giving some context I was the only person there and holding her together which she fully admits to. She was completely confused by the counseling and asked to change therapist. \n\nAfter a few days and working out the technical errors of the new surveys she had to take she was offered a new therapist. At this point our relationship was in a tough spot and we were both stressed, upset and in need of some help together. We both strive for growth mindsets and doing the best things we can for our mental health and decided to try to find couples counseling. \n\nWe found reGain which at the time we did not realize was a partner of better help. We soon found that out when my partner signed up and her first recommended therapist was the one who ruined her emotional state and told her to break off the relationship. This was obviously concerning. I decided to sign up to invite her and we were able to find someone else.\n\nDuring this time my partner was paired with another therapist and had a session with them which went much better than the last session. There was some hope finally. My partner was very active in messaging and journaling within the app however her therapist was not. She scheduled another call with them and they never attended. They took almost 24 hours to even respond in a message! And when they did they offered no apology and simply asked if she wanted to reschedule for the weekend. When my partner messaged she received more radio silence and the weekend passed before she heard back. That weekend my partner had a mental breakdown and I had almost taken her to the hospital if I hadn’t been able to resolve some of it myself. Although in hindsight the hospital might have been the responsible decision - I can’t unfortunately make that professional assessment - although I’m sure a responsible therapist could have.\n\nAt this point we abandoned the idea of betterhelp and attempted to cancel. Luckily we had found a couples therapist who we coincidentally talked to the morning after the breakdown and that was desperately needed. We emailed better help to cancel and it took them quite a few days to respond. For the next month there was back and forth emails with long delays and problems left unresolved. Completely frustrated and now quite irritated we finally asked for a refund.\n\nWhen we did they asked us to check our bank statement because they were having trouble locating her account. We reluctantly hadn’t actually checked the account to see the charges at this stage. When we looked we discovered that we not only not been given the discount and were charged fully but were charged TWICE! Totaling $760 for almost ruining our relationship and causing my partner a mental breakdown! Times were already tough due to the pandemic and that fee along with the stress we were enduring felt like a slap in the face.\n\nWe tried calling but discovered they offer no consultation or technical support other than through the email system that they have that they sometimes takes days to respond on. This is highly unprofessional and borderline dangerous giving the service they are meant to provide.\n\nWhen we were left email as the only form of communication we were met with incredible resistance in requesting a refund with emails that took days to get responses from and were often misspelled, completely in-personable along with being addressed “better help team” and never a person even when we were obviously very distressed.\n\nWhen they did finally attempt to resolve the situation they only offered to refund for the month were we were charged trying to cancel the account and not using any of the services.\n\nMy partner issued concern at how irresponsible, unprofessional, dangerous and potentially harmful how they handled this situation was. In this seriousness they offered little understanding or compassion and reacted almost as dutifully as a legal firm would and not a therapy service with only statements about how they could not refund us because of technicalities completely ignoring our frustration.\n\nAt this point we were not only disheartened and frustrated but we were scared. Scared for anyone else who might be affected by better helps dealings and even worse if someone could be more hurt than we were by them. There are peoples LIVES in their hands.\n\nI decided to do some research and found out this was INCREDIBLY common. This absolutely destroyed me. This company is not only taking advantage of the vulnerable, they are potentially harming AND killing them, AND making a terrible name for the wonder that therapy can offer for people. \n\nIt was at this time I decided this was no longer about my partner and I but this was about EVERYONE. \n\nI write this message because my partner and I plan to take legal action. However our case alone would not be enough to cause any disruptance necessary to make change. I post here in the hopes to find others who have been mistreated by this service so that we can come together and fight together for the health and help of the vulnerable and for the name of therapy. \n\nI wish to start a Go fund me campaign to raise funds for legal help and gather evidence from anyone who has been hurt by them so we can stop this. For those involved, if we sue them maybe you can get your money back too.\n\nI know that better help has probably helped many and therapy is a great way to  help enhance your life however there are very practical and delicate measures you have to take that better help needs to do. Betterhelp needs to change their ways or people will get hurt, vulnerable people who\njust want help.\n\nLet’s make the world a better place and hold those who are irresponsible, careless and taking advantage of the vulnerable accountable. \n\nYou can email luckysyns@gmail.com to talk with me or to share any evidence you have. I will post in the coming days when I have started the go fund me campaign.\n\nI have shared this with betterhelp and hope to hear from them soon.\n\n*Edit: they have refunded us. I also shared the post with the team in an email and conveniently all of my comments seem to have gotten 8-9 downvotes all equally but the comments were much more supportive. Something suspicious I might think 😐",

She emailed back saying she hopes today (the next day) was better and nicely asked me to only email her about scheduling. She said her schedule was full until our next appointment and gave me a help hotline I could call. She also didn’t tell me anything about the walk in day I’d asked about, which is tomorrow. \n\nI felt awful about it. I’ve been having urges to self harm (that I haven’t told her about) and it got so much worse because of the embarrassment and shame over sending this email and feeling quite rejected. \n\nI was kind of confused because I guess the lines have been blurry for a bit. At the end of May, I had coverage that was running out and after one session she said I could send her an email if I needed to talk over my lunch break at work or whatever. Probably because it could be paid for with this coverage that I wasn’t going to be able to use otherwise. But I thought if she was willing to do it then, she might be able to talk to me for a short time about this really bad experience I’d had that I didn’t know how to handle. \n\nI’ve also discussed email with her and she said some clients send her an email about things they’d like to discuss in session. I said I was worried about boundaries and she said that’s for her to worry about, not me. \n\nSo I felt absolutely awful for days because of this and I am going to have a really hard time showing up to our next session and facing her after all of this.",

She mentioned we haven’t gone to the city in over a month and she knows I’m busy but she really misses me and hates being away from me so much.\n\nI pretty much just told her I was really sorry and I thought it was valid how she felt, but I didn’t know what else to say.

    "selftext": "I've thought about this for a long while and still don't know what to do.\n\nFor the last three years of my life I have had about 12 therapists. Sometimes up to 4 at once. They don't know about each other. I present with different problems and occasionally as different people (age, occupation, history). I utilize a mix of in person and online. \n\nI pay out of pocket. It's like a hobby. I develop very deep bonds with the therapists. It is extremely fulfilling at times. It can also feel very lonely. I have learned a lot. \n\nI also have legitimate diagnosis (anxiety related). I do not have any issues with boundaries in other areas of my life. I am married with children, work full time, and have low conflict but distant relationships. I seem very normal to most. \n\nI know there is something else wrong with me. This started as boredom and blew up into an addiction. I'd like treatment for it, but I'm afraid. \n\nI am extremely attached to one of my current T's. I've talked to him for a year. He is amazing and supportive and has taught me more than others. However 50% of it is a lie (my age, place in life, etc). The themes are the same as what I struggle with in real life. \n\nI'm thinking about coming clean to him, but I'm terrified. He has said before that he trusts me, I am a client he looks forward to seeing, and we have a good therapeutic relationship. I'm afraid this will break everything and he won't want to work with me knowing the truth. \n\nHas anyone heard of anything like this before? Any advice for treatment? \n\nFwiw: I have severe guilt over this. I feel terrible for manipulating good people in this way. I do know that I am very messed up. On the other hand, keep in mind I pay out of pocket, I do not utilize sliding scales or assistance, and I do not cross boundaries with my therapists (calling out of session, emergencies, etc). I care deeply about them and am thankful for everything they give me.",

    "title": "Group therapist made me seem awkward and weird",
    "selftext": "I'm in an Interpersonal Process Group. There was a woman about my age in the group (let's call her Tina) and she would mention having the same conflict avoidance and inability to express her own opinions or preferences like I do. It was cool to hear someone else in the group talk about having some of the exact same thought processes as me. One time she mentioned how one of her difficulties is she sets certain expectations for people and always gets disappointed when they don't meet them. During the following week, I had an situation with someone that made me wonder if that is also what I do and why I'm constantly sad in the couple of friendships I have. For the next two weeks, Tina was absent from the group and when she came back, I brought up how what she had said made me think because I had XYZ situation and wonder if I'm doing what she does and wanted to see how she would have reacted in this situation. The therapist leading the group said, “Tina, did you hear what Iamval2 is saying? She missed you when you were absent and she wants to be closer with you.” I felt really awkward because that was not what I was saying at all and it sounded a bit much to me. I wanted her take on my situation and if she would have had a similar reaction, but I can't exactly say “no, I didn't really miss her and  this isn't an attempt to get closer to her” because that's rude and strange to say lol. I was just relating to something she had said before and am asking her perspective...\n\nA few weeks later, Tina announced she was leaving the group because of scheduling issues and the therapist asked us to tell her how we've felt with her in the group. She then calls on me and says “Iamval2, I know you feel especially close to Tina. What do you want to tell her about how her leaving will affect you?” I felt weird again because it makes me sound over-the-top and the only time I spoke directly to Tina was that ONE time above. Also, I am actually happy she is leaving the group because she seems cool and maybe now we can grab a (virtual) coffee since we're not both in the group. It would be cool to have an acquaintance or friend who can relate to my social difficulties. I said it was nice being in the group with her and she's always very supportive and said a lot of things I could relate to. The therapist chimes in “So Iamval2 is saying she's really sad you are leaving and is going to miss you in the group and  feel your absence.” Again, it's more than I said. I responded “yeah, it sucks you are leaving, but I understand the issue with scheduling...”  Tina said \"thank you, it's nice to hear I brought something to the group.\" She then said she wants to say something to another woman in our group who has shared a lot and she hopes this woman will do well moving forward and that she thinks about her in between sessions because the woman has mentioned severe mental health issues. So she kinda changed the subject, which is good because there was this awkward focus on me.\n\nThe week after, the therapist starts the group saying how this is our first group after Tina left. Then, “Iamval2, I want to check in on how you are doing. I know you felt close to her and I want to make sure you are doing okay now that she's not here.” The other group members smiled and a few kinda laughed. I felt so so weird. It's being made to sound like I am obsessed with this woman or something and I feel so uncomfortable and weird. And obviously the group members get that vibe if he they smiled/laughed. I just said  “it's too bad she's not in the group anymore. She was a supportive group member. I understand how schedules change so I totally understand why she had to leave” and luckily she didn't push further. I feel like a weirdo and now not going to reach out to this woman because I feel like I did come across like I was obsessed with her or clingy or something over-the-top. I'm mad because I didn't think I acted that way in group. My point of being in the group is that I never contribute to conversations and have difficulty making friends. I tried by “reaching out”to Tina that one time in group and the therapist made it into this overblown, awkward thing.",

They told me they still care about me even though they are not attracted to me. We talked about how because of my Child sexual abuse history, i always associated caring/love with sexuality.. so it feels like they are taking away love for not being sexually interested. We talked about how there is transference going on where I am idealizing them because they represent what I needed and never got from a caregiver. I told them there is a part of me that feels I can make them like me and I wanted to know why they weren’t attracted to me. They said they were going to set a boundary there and not answer those questions.\n\nI told them I felt mad at them and rejected for saying that they were not attracted to me. I told them it made me feel like I was unattractive since I have based my worth on others’ opinions and validation. I asked them if they felt disgusted with me for liking them. They said no, they were not disgusted. They said they understood where the disgust was coming from.. it may be because I am feeling disgust thinking about how my dad crossed inappropriate sexual boundaries and also because I am being queer for being attracted to my therapist (I am a woman and they are transmasculine/queer).\n\nI told them I feel hopeful and safer now that I know they would not cross that boundary/are not even attracted to me. This is important work and breakthrough! Someone is caring about me without wanting a sexual incentive!! I still have hurt feelings and ego though, for them not being attracted to me.\n\nDo you all think they could have said they were not attracted to me in a gentler way?\n\nThis is a good session, though.. I’d say. Support would be appreciated! Thank you :)",

    "selftext": "I'm 27F, with almost a whole life of mental illness and trauma which became extremely severe around 6 years ago. \n\nI've been working with my current (and first ever) T since 3 years now and it has helped me in tremendous ways. It was ofcourse never smooth sailing and has been a very rocky journey with everything from ODs, SH, SI, severe depression, BPD and finally, bipolar 2. But through it all, I always made it through - graduating from college on honor roll, progressing steadily in my career, being completely functional even on days I couldn't get out of bed and thankfully, not giving in to SI.\n\nMy T has been my biggest supporter through out and has been the only ray of light I see most weeks. Since we work on my childhood trauma often (of which I have A LOT), I am really attached to her and love her immensely as the maternal figure / sense of security I never had. We've worked through my feelings of transference in great depth over the years as well, hence I do understand where these feelings stem from.\n\nT on the other hand, is 32F and is literally the most nurturing, caring, understanding and non-judgemental person ever. She has great (quite solid) boundaries which I truly respect and has never given me any reason to doubt her credibility or showed any red flags. I feel completely safe around her and I end most sessions by sheepishly saying \"I love you\" like a 3 year old kid. 🙈 Hearing her reciprocating the feeling with a smile, in the gentlest way, feels like the purest form of love I've ever recieved. 🥺\n\nRecently, I finally won a huge battle with regards to my drug addiction after 7 years of heavily abusing recreational and prescription drugs. It's been a little over 3 months now that I am finally sober! 😌\n\nIn my last session, I disclosed to my T how long I'd been clean and how proud I was of it. She was equally proud and I jokingly said I wish I had a 3 month chip to mark my progress. For the first time ever, T got really excited and asked me if I would like to recieve a handmade chip and have a mini-celebration in her office, during my next session. 😂\n\nShe asked how I'd like to celebrate while also pitching in ideas like snacks, balloons and speeches. I feel like a really shy kid around her so I ended up laughing and hiding behind a pillow at first, but ofcourse I was super happy and I agreed to a celebration. We're gonna go ahead with whatever she has in mind as I was too shy and awestruck to give any of my own ideas lol. 🙈\n\nWe ended our session on a great, wholesome note and she said she couldn't wait to celebrate with me next week and by the looks of it, she really meant it :') \n\nIt was probably one of the happiest moments I've ever had, especially in recent years, and I just wanted to share how loved I feel. :)\n\nI feel super excited for our celebration next week as I genuinely have no idea what to expect. Moreover, i also feel super shy and childlike and I'm afraid I'm just gonna be so happy that I'll secretly want to hug her like a mom 🥺🙈\n\nTo any T reading this, you guys are awesome and sometimes the biggest supporters a person has ever had. ❤️",

You're limited to just a handful of therapists who actually have the experience and training to confidently deal with you. In that pool of professionals, literally everyone has endless waiting times, IF they're still taking clients at all. And simply trying outside of that pool isn't a good solution either. In most cases you're just going to get instantly rejected as a client or end up with something that doesn't help you adaquately and in some instances even outright damages you. Plus certain types of issues just intrinsically mean that you're more likely to run into problems within the therapeutic relationship, making it harder for you to match up even if you are in therapy with someone who's right for you on paper. \n\nObviously it's toddler logic and I should just be a grown up but fuck it, if it isn't beyond infuriating to know that I easily would have a therapist by now if I was looking for someone to vent about common life issues or to get advice that's covered in any basic cbt workbook.",

My therapist seemed immune to it but I felt like I was going to throw up. I really did try to push through but 10 minutes in I just couldn't bear it anymore and I left the session. I was so relieved to be away from the smell but also so incredibly upset that I had to end a much needed session early.\n\nI really hoped that my therapist would offer for me to make up the minutes the following week but she didn't even reach out to me.\n\nShe will be sending me her bill shortly and she's going to bill me for that full 50 minute hour. Would I be wrong to tell her I will refuse to pay for it? My reasoning is that it is her responsibility to provide a suitable environment for therapy, even if the smell was out of her control. But she might argue back that she was available for therapy and therefore I have to pay, as per her rules. I would be willing to compromise and pay for the first 10 minutes of it even.\n\nWhat do other people think? Am I overreacting? I do care for my therapist and want them to be able to make a living.

She was like, \"of course it's no problem, I curse \\*all the time\\* outside the therapy office, I just err toward professionalism here.\" She seemed to be stifling some laughter, like, *if only you could see how much I fucking curse IRL*.

She has seen me cry, happy, mad, just about every emotion. During the first month of our sessions together, she saw me having the worst day of my life, she saw me suffering from suicidal thoughts, I was suffering three days before I called her and she was there to help me through it. \n\nShe was there where I cried about my weight and never thought I would go through with bariatric surgery, and yet, I did it, after wanting it for 15 years. She was so proud.\n\nBecause of COVID-19, I was robbed of an in-person session and did the sessions over the net since March, the sessions began normally, talking about what my week has been, what issues I've been dealing with, normal stuff. About 35 minutes in, I switched it to reflecting about the past two years, she was proud of how I've grown, we talked about some of the serious and fun times that we had.\n\nThe reflecting went so fast that time ran up, I said goodbye, and she said goodbye and said she will never forget me, a moment later, she closed the session. That was it, a normal session that happened, and it ended.\n\nI cry that she will never see me grow even more as a person, she has seen chapter one and wanted her to see chapter two. \n\nShe told me who the next person is going to be taking over my case, and says she is great, I have comfort that person I trust is leaving me in the hands of someone she trusts.\n\nI mentioned that sometimes we are forced to play with the cards that we are dealt with, I started with a bad hand, I can say I'm holding a better hand today thanks to her.

I really liked her but she mentioned being a counsellor at a high school during the day and things being chaotic once the school year started.  Sure enough she no-showed for an appointment - no warning - and the next day rebooked, said the school had been in lockdown.  It sucked because I was in the middle of some really difficult stuff and had to just sit on it.   We got back on track and I settled in.  This was a few weeks ago.\n\nThis on Monday she did the same thing - no warning - and an hour late said, sorry the school is \"going crazy\".  Then we rebooked for tonight - and she didn't show AGAIN.\n\nAfter waiting 10 minutes I sent her this message: \n\n\"T, I'm sorry but this is not remotely workable for me.  I'm in a difficult time and I need to be able to trust my therapist and lean on them.  When you don't show up for the agreed-upon time, it causes me a great deal of stress and makes things worse.   I don't know what's going on with you but I can't possibly continue at this point.  I'm disappointed because I enjoyed our sessions but I'm going to have to switch to another therapist.\"\n\nShe responded (finally showing up half an hour late):  \n\"I understand.. I am so sorry that this is not working for you.  I also understand that you are having a difficult time... it makes me nervous actually that your distress is so high...not even angry like, but deeper feeling of this being the only lifeline....an online platform is difficult at best, but when you are really need of assistance, it is not nearly as effective as in person contact.\"\n\nAm I losing my mind here, or is she gaslighting me for being upset at her for not showing up to three appointments?  And blaming me for relying on her?  The issue is not the online platform - but the fact that she can't reliably show up.  Have you ever experienced anything like this from a therapist before?",

Then a few months ago she told me she had finally found one she thinks would be a great fit.\n\nWhen she first told me about them, she never once said what their name was or how she found them.\n\nWhat she did say was that this person had completed their degree but was currently unlicensed. She thought I might have a problem with this and basically told me that they're black and black people in this field have more difficulty getting these kinds of things because it's controlled by a white majority and the field is catered for white people.\n\nI don't disagree with what she's saying, there is a reason we don't see many black therapists  (atleast out here in the western states of the us). But the way she was talking about it made me think there was more too it.\n\nOne day I was on her insagram and everything became much more clear.\n\nI discovered that they have been following eachother and in her DM's there were messages with this therapist going back about a year and a half BEFORE she even told me about this person.\n\nI didn't see anything overtly sexual in the messages, but my gut feeling was that something just didn't feel right. \n\nFor context I didn't even know I was looking at her insagram exchanges with her therapist until I got to read where she was asking to be taken on as a patient, I thought it was just some random person in her DM's she had not told me about.\n\nThe messages started out with just the typical reactions to a post the other had made, and then they started to get more acquainted with eachother. Talking about likes, dislikes, checking in to see how the other is doing based on a post they saw the other make. All this before they even started doing therapy sessions together.\n\nShe was already talking about her family with them, like how music in her grandparent's day was just as sexual and raunchy in their time as it is today. The therapist's response to that was not a \"Yes or I agree\" in any way, they simply said this:\n\n\"I want to lick you up and down, all over town, now turn around.\"\n\nThen I saw a month ago the therapist had sent a heart emoji in responce to one of my wife's gym selfies, after they had already started therapy together. \n\nI think that was one of the main things that made me feel this was an unprofessional relationship, why is a therapist reacting to my wife's gym selfie? Is this a normal thing to do?\n\nSo am I being completely insecure/paranoid and all of this is pretty innocent, or is my gut right and this feels like an unprofessional relationship with a therapist?\n\nAlso, if this is unprofessional how do I even attempt to bring this up with her?",

I commonly received feedbacks and tips that do not work for me. My career has been disrespected or underestimated by doctors and therapists.

They let themselves to judge it and believe in their judgment. \n\nMaking a piece of art takes so much thinking, control, mood management, coordination between your body and mind, and problem-solving. \n\nArt is part of an Artist’s life and existence. We can't put it aside just because therapists think I should. Our whole life structure falls apart, and meaning and excitements for it. If you are an artist and struggling, don't drop your pen and keep it working. I have seen this always to be helpful not only for me but for so many other professionals artists I have met. \n\n If you are a therapist please don't guess how someone is living or working. I have seen this happens a lot. Please, please listen and listen again! \n\nI have been given medications to feel less depressed or stressed but messed up with my thinking and creativity, so I got worse. My doctor even told me that this medication could make me feel stupid, but it's ok because I only draw! \n\nYou artists and very young people, you don't have to listen to whatever you are told.

Some people can get late term abortions you know? \n\nMe: ok but that’s not the point he can’t tell women what to do with their bodies , (I’m a man and I defend my belief)\n\nTherapist: I have half trumper patients and half Harris patients. My trump supporter patients are good people!\n\nMe: um ok of course not all are bad my cousin is a Trumper and I love her but some have cut my family off and we never did that\n\nTherapist: I had a Jewish man who voted for Trump tell me how you can’t call Trump “Hitler” as it’s offensive to the Jews who fled Germany and the holocaust survivors\n\nMe: *thinking: I never once even brought up trump being Hitler even though I believe that idea.

    "selftext": "Sweet baby Jesus. I’ve been in therapy with my current T for 4.5 years. During that time, I’ve lost my mom, couch surfed due to housing insecurity, uprooted my life to begin a new job, started and ended my first relationship and have nearly completed graduate school and now have plans to begin my PhD.\n\nWhen I first started meeting with my T, I was a nervous wreck who had terrible boundaries with those close to me. My mom died 5 months after starting therapy and my life spiraled for a year afterwards. \n\nThe last 10 months have been unlike anything I’ve ever experienced before. I’m finally making solid progress in most areas my therapist and I have worked on. I’ve lost a ton of weight in the last 10 months and am on track to lose 1/2 of my starting body weight by next January. I’ve been organized and really focused on doing the work that’s expected of me in therapy. I argue with him less and listen to what he has to say. I’m brave enough to reflect on a difficult session and come back next time with a clear head to gain clarification so that my emotions and anger don’t cloud my ability to listen clearly. \n\nI can honestly say that I’ve been free of any substantial symptoms of depression for the last 6 months. I cannot remember the last time I wasn’t depressed and oscillating between thoughts of suicide or substantial self harm. I’m almost 30 and cannot remember ever feeling like my life was together or that there was hope that I’d ever feel mentally well. It took a really long time in therapy to feel like I’ve been able to sustain progress. It took dozens of threats from my therapist to end therapy because of my perceived lack of motivation and lack of progress. It took countless boxes of tissues and notebooks for journaling. It’s taken nearly 2,500 hours of therapy. That’s a LOT of time. That’s about 104 days of my life and of his.\n\nI still have challenges, but my approach to them has been so much better. My T and I have been having really productive sessions and I come prepared and give myself homework. I approach therapy clearly and without any shame or reservations. I’m able to focus on myself and view the time and money I invest in this as the highest form of self-care I can provide myself. I don’t know what made me flip the switch, but I’ve never been more proud of myself. I’ve actually IMPLEMENTED habits. They’re here to stay. \n\nI still have my fair share of ups and downs with my T, but I can honestly say he saved my life. I recognize my privileged in accessing any mental health care -especially during a global pandemic- but I’m especially fortunate to have lucked out with him. Until 3 years ago, I lived in the middle of nowhere and was a 4 hour round trip drive from his office. Telehealth was my only option and I’m glad I risked trying it out. When I got my first car and my license, I chose to start making the drive to his office after work for one of our two weekly sessions. I’d meet with him for 2 hours in the evening and wouldn’t get home until almost 11 at night. My new job brought me closer to his office but covid made us go remote again. I’m glad I’m a pro at it by now. I wouldn’t have changed anything. It was work, but I was also work. He has invested so much time in me despite the fact that I’m not the easiest client to deal with. Several months ago he actually said I was one of his most mentally ill clients he was seeing at the time.\n\nI’m going from worst to first and it feels fucking great. I’ve never felt hopeful until recently. I hope everyone is able to experience hope as they navigate out of the darkness and are able to access a therapist like mine. He’s a fucking legend and there’s hope for all of us if there was hope for me. \n\nI’ve been at rock bottom before staring down into a bottle of pills with every intention of ending my life. Not anymore. Life isn’t great, but I’m blessed and can respond to challenges so much more skillfully now than ever before. \n\nWhen the day comes and it’s time to end therapy, I’ll be devastated beyond all measure. I know it’ll be time for me to leave the nest, but he has really given me a new lease on life. I know my transference issues will be at an all time high when that day comes, but I’m brave enough to talk to him about those fears when that time approaches. He’s an incredible therapist and pushes his clients to work their asses off. Every therapist until now just sat there and told me only what I wanted to hear and not what I NEEDED to hear. For that I will always be thankful.",

    "selftext": "This is about something that happened a while back, but it has not stopped bothering me and I would love the community's feedback on this and how I should have handled the situation.\n\nI was seeing a therapist for a couple of years when I was in grad school, and I really liked her and trusted her fairly well. One of the main issues we worked on was my fear that people find me awkward and weird because I am autistic, as I experienced a lot of bullying growing up and within my family.  I knew some random things about here that she had disclosed - that her dogs had their own room and slept on futons, etc.\n\nI went into autistic burnout because of the high stress level while dissertating and losing everything in an apartment fire, and because I was actively suicidal and not sure I could control that impulse, I checked myself into hospital for 5 days. \n\nThere was a psychiatric nurse who started following me around the ward, talking to me, even when I tried to get away from him. He kept saying \"I hate people who are awkward and weird, don't you?\" Finally I said \"Please stop asking me if I hate people who are awkward and weird. I am autistic and it is something I worry about\", to which he replied \"I know. That is why I am saying it.\"\n\nHe also mentioned having dogs that had their own room with futons and other specific things my therapist had mentioned, other issues I had talked about only in therapy.\n\nWhen I was discharged, I told my therapist about this psychiatric nurse and asked if she had provided her therapy notes to the hospital, because it really seemed like that nurse knew a lot about what went on in therapy. It turned out that the nurse was her husband. She did not make any effort to explain why her husband knew so much about me, why he would remember those things about me in such detail (it's not like I was her only patient), why he should know what private things she had disclosed to me like about the dogs... I told her I was going to report him for his behavior, and she said \"OK\" and that was it. There was no further discussion.\n\nI emailed her once I got home and broke off therapy with her, because I was so freaked out, but I also did not report him or her, for that matter. It felt so completely bizarre to me that I doubted anyone would even believe me if I tried to explain what happened. I go back in firth in my head about whether she was aware of what he was doing, if her intent was benign or malevolent. His intent seems clearly malevolent to me.\n\nAt the time I did not want to hurt this therapist, but the farther away from the event I am, the angrier I have become about it. I deeply regret not doing anything, but I don't really know what I should have done in pragmatic terms. Until recently, it has made trust in therapy impossible.

This did not affect my thought of staying with him.\n\nToday, however, I went straight to the point: I don't think that the therapeutic relationship will last any longer than it already has. To my surprise, he was in total agreement with my statement. He actually said that he has held that very belief for several months prior to today. He also said, unfortunately, that he has absolutely \\*no idea\\* who in the local area \\*would\\* be a good fit for me. \"Certainly no one at this agency,\" he said. And he would know, given he's the supervisor of the entire outpatient wing of the agency. \n\nSo, that's a bit of a let down. But, and this is a huge but, he didn't drop me to the ground.

    "selftext": "My therapist is an amazing human being, I'm thankful for her everyday, she's helped me turn my life around, etc etc. But today, we had a long session (~2 hours) and we got super casual towards the end where we got to talking about times she had messed up during our sessions. It was pretty funny, I was teasing her a bit and she was laughing and admitting to messing up, she even brought up mistakes she made that I didn't remember. But in that talk, we ended up accidentally stumbling into a incredibly simple but important revelation.\n\nThe revelation was: Not everything I mention in therapy is an invitation to talk about it. \n\nMy therapist has an issue where she wants/tries to pull me into whatever topic I bring up and/or she focuses on whatever she feels is most pertinent. While that works a lot of the time and she has a great mind for it, there are a number of times where that doesn't work and she has actively upset me because she pressures me to talk about something I don't want to talk about. \n\nAnd today, once we were joking about it, she asked me why does that happen? What I said/realized is that I try to answer all of her questions with complete raw honesty, but what that means is that I'm going to tell her exactly what the answer is but that doesn't mean I want to talk about everything I mention in the answer. Inevitably, when she asks a question, it's just going to lead to an answer that's irrelevant or a topic that feels unsafe, or one that will make me angry and ruin the productivity of the session, etc. When I said that, she explained that she usually takes the answers I give as an invitation to start talking about whatever it is that I mentioned, and that's where the disconnect is. \n\nI say something because I want to be honest, open, and not avoidant or dismissive. I'm essentially saying \"you asked for it, here's my truth.\" \n\nBut when she's hearing it, that's not how she receives it. What she hears is \"here's what I want to talk about today.\" \n\nWe were still joking when we realized this but it seems like it might have a big impact on how we talk to one another. I think I've tried explaining this to her before but today it really resonated, so I'm excited about how this might change/improve our dynamic.\n\nAnyway, thought I'd share in case anyone else has had similar experiences. I've been seeing my therapist for 3 years at this point and it still amazes me how you can continue to discover new things as simple and fundamental as this.",

I used to look forward to seeing her and felt like our relationship was solid, largely because she felt like a ‘real’ person (engaging, challenging, imperfect, honest, proactive, funny).

Her response wasn’t angry at all. I asked if she was ok, if she felt like she’d needed to distance herself from her clients more. She just said that she’s been doing a new course that uses a different style. I said that I’m not finding this approach useful at all (I haven’t got a single thing out of this past year, which is a total backflip on the past). The main focus of our work over the years had been on building my confidence in trusting people (cPTSD), to let them close to me and not run away, social anxiety and being able to let others ‘see’ me after a lifetime of protecting and hiding myself away. It was the first time in my life that I felt like I was learning that someone was ‘safe’. And since I spend 99% of my life alone, why would I want to be just talking to myself there too? I already get enough blank stares in my life from my cat.\n\nShe said we’d talk about it next session to “find a compromise”. But I feel like she’s trying to put her own desire to use this new style ahead of what would be most helpful to me specifically.

It was the most bizarre therapy session I’ve ever had and she ended up referring me out to a trauma specialist a few weeks later. \n\nI think about this session every now and again because it was so weird and I couldn’t believe I made the therapist so distressed in session.

I have been hospitalized several times and done PHP/IOP programs twice. Nothing has helped. The meds keep the worst at bay, but I struggle to stay on them. Several months ago, my wonderful therapist witnessing me going off my meds and sliding into another suicidal depression, said: \"Can you just agree to live for six months? Really live.\" At the time, I could not make that promise. I was worried she would tell me she couldn't help me, that I was too much or that I needed more than she could give. She did say I needed more support, but she has never left me and I trust her more than anyone. \n\nLast week I was in as bad a place as ever again. I wasn't sleeping at all. I was purposefully making myself stay awake by setting alarms. I had my plans all laid out I was just waiting until the lack of sleep pushed me over the edge. I felt like my time was running out so I finally told my therapist this secret I had been keeping forever - that I thought I would never tell a single soul and take to the grave. I was so worried about how she (or anyone) would respond if they knew. She was so unbelievably amazing about the whole thing. She made no judgment and made me realize that telling the secret was the beginning of something - the beginning of me living as my authentic self - not the end. \n\nThanks to her response, I think I am finally ready to make that six month promise. I am not sure the point of this post, except to say that I have learned that the point of therapy is to talk about the sh\\*t that's hard to talk about. You'll get way more out of it if you do. And if it's too hard to talk about, write it down instead. But find a way to get to it. Honestly, I think keeping this secret was slowly killing me and I know I'm not cured by any means - but I do feel so much lighter.",

    "selftext": "My therapist has been my most consistent pandemic companion. *By a long shot.* \n\nIf I made a pie chart depicting \"Time I Have Spent With Specific People In The Past Year,\" half of that pie would go to him, and the other half would be shared by my family. (We'll save a sliver for my doctor, neighbor, fraaaands, and my favorite FedEx delivery guy.)\n\nAnd this is fine, you guys. It's just how things went this year. Life was weird and it's *not actually that weird* that the person I had a consistent professional relationship with is the person I saw the most often. It's not. \n\nBut here's what happened. Whenever I try to make conversation, or share interesting facts, or tell someone a conversation I had or a joke someone told me... it's almost always something that happened in talk therapy. This means I have been saying: \n\n\"Mr. T and I were talking about that and...\"\n\n\"Well, my therapist recommended a movie...\"\n\n\"I had the funniest conversation with Mr. T...\" \n\n...like, all the time. Because that's who I talk to. My therapist. That's all I have to share, people. I can tell you about my kids, and I can tell you about my therapy conversations.\n\nBut this means my family and all of the people in the tiny-pie-sliver think I'm 110% obsessed with this guy. And don't get me wrong. He's great. He's an awesome therapist, and I'm so glad to be working with him. But I'm not 110% obsessed. I'm, like, *maaaaybe* 15% obsessed, which is healthy-level obsessed in my book. I'm also 15% obsessed with Kyle Mooney from SNL and no one thinks it's weird. \n\nBut they all think this one's weird. They think I'm in love with my therapist and they need to stage an intervention so I can get right in the head (ironically, *therapy is what is getting my head right, people, lay off.*)\n\n**So. Here's my strategy.** \n\nI've started calling my therapist other stuff. Lots of other things. He has lots of nicknames, now. Here are a few:\n\n\\- *My doctor* (Not a doctor. But almost true.)\n\n\\- *Someone* (Definitely accurate.)\n\n\\- *A friend* (Nope, but it usually makes the most sense in the context)\n\n\\- *Ben* (My brother and three of my favorite friends are named Ben. So although this one is admittedly a lie, it's a very plausible lie. And I don't think any of the Bens would mind. Well, maybe one of the Bens.)\n\nWhen I mix all of these *other* names in with \"my therapist,\" I sound considerably less crazy. And that's the goal here, people. Sounding less crazy. (*Being* less crazy is the endgame, but let's not get ahead of ourselves.)\n\nI share all of this because someone's gotta be able to relate. And someone might even want to borrow the strategy. I dunno. Y'all might be more honest and self-assured than I am. But if anyone's going to relate to some of this, it's all of you. \n\n**I'm proud of us for going to therapy.** It's hard, but it's healthy. And if most of our most meaningful, humorous, interesting and insightful moments of our weeks are in therapy sessions, that is totally ok. It's cool, actually. And I'm working on owning the coolness of it. \n\nBut until I get my self-assuredness up to a higher level, I'm going to implement this strategy. And I bet \"someone\" would support my effort. \n\n:)",

He explained how their species has seen countless examples of intelligent life destroying themselves and the environment they live in, and their goal is to prevent us from doing the same. He also rambled about the technology they use to travel from different galaxies, some space-time field shit that didn't make any sense.\n\nI had a mini-panic attack that I had to hide while he was rambling about that since it was so out of left-field. Not sure what to do, that just seemed a tad unprofessional to me.",

    "title": "Trying to talk about pedophilia with therapists but not being listened to",
    "selftext": "This is a really unusual topic so I don't know what kind of response to expect, but basically I'm coming to terms with the fact that I'm a pedophile. I've struggled with this since I was a teen with tons of anxiety, isolation, self-harm and suicide ideation along the way and only within the past year come to accept who I am.\n\nI went into therapy about a year ago to get help with my poor self esteem and difficulty opening up to others and am on my 3rd therapist. I left my 2 previous therapists after they began treating me poorly after I confessed to them that I was a pedophile. The 1st told me I shouldn't accept that about myself and advocated conversion therapy to \"fix\" me. The 2nd insisted I was a threat to others because I didn't \"feel appropriate shame\" for being a pedophile and needed to take it more seriously. The 3rd, my current therapist, hasn't done anything so ridiculous yet but seems more focused on \"curing\" my pedophilia than on supporting me, saying she thinks it'll make me happier. I've clarified to all 3 of these therapists that I'm not trying to be cured because I don't think I can be cured, I'm coming to therapy for the all the stress, fear, anger, and a million other emotions bottling up inside because of the logistics of living this way.\n\nI like my current therapist and I don't wanna give up on her just yet because it's only been a few sessions but I don't know how to get it through to her. I'm in control of myself, I'm not a threat to anyone, and as great as it would be to not have to deal with being this way it's who I am and I can't change that, I spent years trying to change it and it almost drove me to suicide. I'm just really frustrated that therapy has consistently been a place where I'm not able to be open without judgement.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions of how to approach this?\n\nEDIT: I don't think I have POCD as some comments have suggested—my feelings are consistent, not intrusive, and they aren't disgusting to me.\n\nEDIT 2: Many comments have suggested forensic therapy, but I'm unsure what to look for. I'm doing some searching and finding forensic psychology articles talking almost exclusively about controlling urges and not committing crimes, which is something I don't struggle with. Many of these articles further go on to say that they don't treat pedophilia itself and that attempts to do so aren't considered effective. The treatment I'm looking for is for more \"basic\" things like depression, anxiety, and low self esteem. Would a forensic therapist really be suitable for that? I could always reach out to one but I don't want to be interrogated by someone treating me like a criminal.\n\nEDIT 3: Since this post got locked, just wanted to thank people for the supportive responses, I got a lot less harassment than posts about pedophilia usually get and even on a throwaway account it's still scary working up the nerve to post something like this. While most of the resources posted are ones I was aware of or tried already I appreciate it nonetheless and hopefully they can be of use to other people who many need them. Not sure why specifically this post was locked but it's not unexpected, despite it feeling discouraging. I'll share this thread with my therapist next session and decide based on her response if I'll continuing therapy with her.",

    "title": "I can’t tell if I’m overreacting or if my therapist crossed a line she shouldn’t have.",
    "selftext": "I’ve been seeing my therapist for a little over a year now. I feel like it’s been pretty beneficial. This is the first one I’ve seen that really addressed and is helping me with my childhood trauma and bringing that stuff to light. However, our last session took a weird turn and I can’t tell if I’m being a baby or if she crossed a line…\n\nSo there’s this program designed for recovering addicts and people with complex trauma (me). It’s 3 months long and runs Monday-Friday from 9am to noon. She brought it up and said she thought it would be extremely beneficial for me.\n\nIt sounded pretty great, but I work a full time job and basically live paycheck to paycheck.. so it would not be financially feasible for me. \n\nI told her that I can’t do it because it’s during work and I would not be able to take 3 months off work but she kept pushing it. She said a few things that rubbed me the wrong way such as:\n“what’s more important?” (referring to my mental health or my job) and “you won’t lose your house. You’re young and will make more money in the future” (like how can you tell me that? You don’t know that?)\n\nAnyways I ended up saying I would think about it because she kept pushing it even after I said I couldn’t take that much time away from work and I am just awful with confrontation. But it didn’t sit right with me. I started looking into maybe getting a new therapist and talked to one who suggested before I switch to communicate my feelings to my current therapist and go from there … so i sent her this email:\n\n“Hey (name), \n\nI’ve kind of been stressing about our last session. I appreciate that you think the program would be helpful for me but I felt very pressured and uncomfortable when I brought up my financial situation and you kept pushing it.\n\nI know we’ve talked about how my job is a source of stress and is a toxic environment but I need my job to pay my bills. I need money to survive. I don’t have a savings or a safety net I could fall back on if I had no job (or even a job I made less at). I felt hopeless when you said that “I would make money in the future” and telling me I wouldn’t lose my house. I feel like that’s not fair to say because how could someone possibly know that?\n\n(my fiancé) and I are living paycheque to paycheque and my mom pays for my sessions with you because I can’t personally afford it. 3 months of no work is a very long time and not something I can manage. My financial situation also has a huge impact on my mental health as well and I felt like that was being completely ignored. \n\nI also felt like you were upset with me that I wouldn’t commit to the program. You said you weren’t trying to scold me but I felt like you were.\n\nI am committed to making progress and I feel like we’ve developed a pretty good relationship but our last session left me feeling very upset and defeated. I was worried that you would bring it up again during our next session, or that you would continue to push it in future sessions. \n\nI spoke with someone who suggested I share this with you, to see if we feel like we should/could continue our counselling relationship.”\n\nI sent that earlier today and it’s Sunday so I don’t expect a response but I’ve been so anxious since sending it. \n\nAm I being over sensitive and freaking out over nothing? Or did she overstep? Would appreciate anyones thoughts.\n\nEDIT: Thanks everyone, she’s responded and apologized and said she didn’t realize that my financial situation was what it was. She said she’s glad I brought it to her attention and will keep that in mind going forward.",

    "title": "The First Year is Weird: A 2nd Therapyversary Memoir",
    "selftext": "The last few years have been weird for liiiiiiterally everyone. Time got all bent up and twisted and we were all hanging in there the best we could. If you're like me, therapy has been this strange bit of consistency in a time of constant mindfuckery. This post is in honor and memory of the first year--a promised, reposted preview for those who are *in it.*\n\nNow, I know everyone's therapy experience is different. Like, *vastly* different. But I also know that there are those out there who have been through, or are in the midst of, that rollercoaster of a first year, and can relate to some of this. So. Indulge me, people. It's a long one, but it's kinda fun.\n\ntl;dr: Therapy Is Weird.\n\n**THE MANY MILESTONES OF THE FIRST YEAR OF THERAPY**\n\n(As told by an anxious, panic-prone, trauma denier)\n\n**1. The Intro, Where I Pretend To Be Mostly Normal**\n\n\"Hi, I'm Selfless! I'm a pretty average professional person who's just, you know, low-key nervous about Covid! So happy to meet you!\" I said, while sitting in a chair at a desk like a sane human. I actually think my therapist literally said, \"Yeah, we'll see.\" The nerve of that guy.\n\n**2. Oh. Shit.**\n\nMy first in-therapy panic attack came during our third session, over telehealth, as I sat in the corner of my office holding the laptop where no one could see me. It took me off guard, was humiliating, and confusing, and exhausting, and over *effing* telehealth. I was ready to not come back. The next session, I showed up and said, \"I'm really sorry about that last session.\" He said, \"What the hell do you think therapy is for? I know it was painful for you, but really, Selfless. Bring it on. You're not a burden.\" I was thinking: Just you wait, Mister T. You're going to eat those words.\n\n**3. Trying to Prove You're Worth Their Time**\n\nRemember when your therapist person listened to you talk, gave you \"unconditional positive regard,\" and you were like, nope. I don't deserve *this* kind of attention. No way. Too good to be true. This person seems smart and put together and there's no way I'm worth all this kindness. But maybe I can try to earn it by being the best. Client. Ever. *(Panic-Googles \"How to be the best therapy client ever\" and reads everything.)*\n\n**4. When You Google Your Therapist And Feel Like a Total Creep**\n\nAnd speaking of Googling... I actually thought I was the first person who did this. Which is hilarious, now. The stupid part is, the dude's internet presence is squeaky-clean. I found his Pinterest page and discovered that he likes s'mores a lot, so much there's a whole board dedicated to them (a S'morgasboard? Thank you. Thank you.) And that was about it. And I felt like a total gross stalker person. And then posted here about it, and everyone reassured me that everyone does this. Thanks, everyone.\n\n**5. \"You're going to quit on me and when you do I will surely die.\"**\n\nI didn't say it, but I thought it for weeeeeks. Months? Maybe. And when I say \"thought about it,\" I mean obsessed over it daily. He's going to die/quit/hate me/move/or never have existed in the first place, and then I will probably perish in a puddle of abandoned shame. He must have sensed this, since that's kind of his job, and said, \"I'm not going anywhere.\" And I was like \"I'll believe it when I see it, chump.\" And then...\n\n**6. First Cancellation**\n\nA few weeks later, the receptionist called me a few hours before my appointment, telling me it was canceled. And suddenly, I was the person who cries pathetically on the phone with the receptionist. She must have called Mister T and said, \"Sir, I just talked to your crazy client and she's being crazy,\" because I got a call ten minutes later: \"Heyyy, Selfless. It's your therapist. I'm sorry I had to cancel on you today. I just wanted to tell you that I'm ok, and ask if there was anything you needed to talk about.\" And that's when I became the person who cries pathetically on the phone with two people in one day.\n\n**7. The Day You Find Out Your Parents Weren't Perfect And Your Childhood Was Cray**\n\nAppointment one, I straight-up told Mister T I had an idyllic childhood. Like, that it was perfect. He gave me a very doubtful \"huh.\" And I was like, *how dare you.* And then months later, after reading two short essays I wrote about my relationships with my parents and siblings and how I processed all of my emotions in my closet, he slowly and gently, like a social-working ninja, helped me realize that my childhood was just as fucked up as everyone else's. And I was pissed. (But he was right.)\n\n**8. First Cryptic Email**\n\nI had a med adjustment half a year into therapy that ruined my eva-lovin' mind. Like, immediately. (Everyone else who has experienced this put yo hands up! It suuuucks!) It was a weekend, and I was desperate, and I sent Mister T. the first non-business email I've ever sent him, full of weirdly-worded cries for help and downplayed suicidal ideation. It was embarrassing. And I apologized ASAP. Told him I knew it was inappropriate and I only sent it to him because I was pretty sure he wouldn't read it. And he called it what it was and said, you proooobably aaaaactually sent it to me because you trust me and needed a safe place for your scary thoughts. And I was like fine, know-it-all.\n\n**9. The Day Your T Recommends A Psych Eval**\n\nIt's a terrible feeling when your therapist tells you that a different psychologist person needs to hear about all your shit so they can draw some medically-worded conclusions.\n\n**9.5. Post-Eval Anxiety Sesh**\n\nThis is the common occurrence where you have to process the fact that the psychologist who evaluated you thought you were being oppressed by demons. Oh. Wait. That doesn't happen to most people? Nm then.\n\nAlso, though, one of my tests came back invalidated because of \"possible over-reporting.\" I immediately emailed Mister T begging him not to read the results. Because what if he never trusted me again? What if he trusted \"Dr. You're-a-demon-possessed-liar, PsyD\" instead? Writing it out, it doesn't make much sense. When I showed up to our session, Mister T held up the report and said, \"I'm so fucking frustrated with this guy.\" Phew.\n\n**10. Convincing Your T You're Not Ok**\n\nThere was one session where my therapist told me he was excited to talk himself out of a job. My heart rate jumped by like 100 bpm. Ummmmm nope. You're on retainer for life, my friend. And in case you're not convinced, here's a really cool panic attack I made, just for you. See, look how messed up I still am? Please stay forever.\n\n**11. The Day You Both Figure Out Why You're So Not Ok**\n\nI'm actually not sure how common this is, but I didn't identify my own trauma as trauma for a good 8 months. I thought it was so normal that *I had not even mentioned it.* And as soon as it started coming out, we were both relieved. Kinda horrified, definitely overwhelmed, but also relieved. Because suddenly, all this anxiety and panic and stress made a whole lot more sense to both of us. Our sessions were more focused. The puzzle pieces fit. Then, we started doing therapy frrealz.\n\n**12. When The Masks Come Off. The Actual, Literal, Covid Masks (and the Other Ones)**\n\nThe first session in-person, where we took off our masks, was hella weird. Just the most awkward thing ever. It was almost too real, and too intense. I had made Mister T into some two-dimensional cartoon character, and suddenly he was an actual man with a *mouth*. (And then a goose scared me at the window. That pushed me over the edge.)\n\nBut just as Covid-masks coming off made things a realer shade of real, so did the removal of the metaphorical masks. There was the day I finally called the trauma, trauma, and called the abuse, abuse. There was the day Mister T had not slept and dropped some serious truth-bombs because he was too tired for my bullshit. There was a lot of mutual humanness, and I know there will be a lot more.\n\nBecause therapy is weird, you guys, but I'm a much \"me-er me\"\\* (\\*that's a Mister T trademark) after a year of it than I ever imagined I could be. So I encourage all of you to push through the awkward. Get to the truth. Know you're not a creep, know you're worth their time, forgive yourself for the cryptic emails and insecurities and continue onward. This is hard work, but it's worth doing.",

By normalised, I mean responses like 'loads of people feel like this, it's ok', 'don't worry, it's normal to feel like that', 'it's understandable when you feel that way' in response to something that's presumably clinically abnormal such as suicidal ideation or what have you?\n\nI made a post here a while ago wondering why I was a little bothered when my therapist didn't react to me telling her about my suicidal ideation, and I suspect this is a similar thing. \n\nLike, surely it's *not* normal? I don't want it to be 'normal' or 'ok' because it's hopefully not normal and it's definitely not ok to me. \n\nI have no idea if this makes sense, but I was wondering if anyone had any experience in speaking to their therapist about it? Everyone I've met irl has wanted their problems to be normalised, and has wanted to be told that how they feel is ok.  \n\nAlso yes, I can see the irony with my question. I want my pov to be normalised. Shit.",

    "selftext": "The email:\n\n\n\n\n\nHey. I just want to start by saying that this is incredibly difficult and embarrassing for me to write and tell you. My main concern is not wanting to make you feel uncomfortable, which is the reason I’ve bottled it up for so long. I’ve written this email like 5 times and none of it sounds right, but I’m just going to say it.\n\nI have transference and have developed what I feel is too strong of an attachment with you. It’s been going on for about 6 months now. I’m fully aware that these feelings aren’t “real” and are because of unmet support needs in my life. I just don’t know how to make it stop or go away. I don’t want to feel this way. I want to maintain a professional therapeutic relationship and don’t desire more than that.\n\nYou aren’t the first person I’ve done this with either. I’ve been doing this limerence/over attachment stuff on a constant basis since I was 12 years old. Mostly with older male authority figures. When I was younger it was my teachers and as I became an adult it started with my bosses/managers. This happens regardless of if I find them attractive or if I even like them as a person, it’s happened with people I’ve even disliked. I don’t really understand why I do this, or how to fix it. \n\nThis is why I originally asked for a female therapist, but when I found out I’d be working with you I thought I’d be able to handle working with a male therapist and prevent the transference from happening. I set strong boundaries for myself (not allowing myself to think about you outside of sessions, not entertaining any intrusive thoughts that came up, avoiding out of session contact, etc) But the transference developed anyway.\n\nI would love to work on this in therapy with you if you’re willing. I know some therapists work with transference and some terminate over it. I’m not sure where you stand with it. I really do enjoy working with you and having you as my therapist but if you’re too uncomfortable with this to continue our work together I completely understand. If I have made you uncomfortable I am deeply sorry. \n\nI will ask for one favor though. If you have the time to respond to this email with your thoughts on this I would greatly appreciate it. If you need to terminate with me, please do so over text or email before my next appointment/cancel my next appointment. I’m just scared of coming in on Friday and not knowing what will happen. I know I’m going to react strongly to termination and would prefer to do that in private. \n\nThank you for your time and I am truly so sorry.",

She was very candid with it and she was very brave (I hope that isn’t patronizing) and she mentioned she told me first because she wanted to tell someone who she knew would believe her and wouldn’t invalidate her. I’m honored she trusted me and felt safe enough to share that with me.\n\nSome of the details she told me were absolutely *horrific* and I don’t even want to repeat them, and if I’m being honest it upset me so much hearing what happened and what she carried around with her all for a good chunk of her life and all by herself. Additionally, I’ve been absolutely terrified of possibly doing or saying something that may trigger her so I think I’ve been going overkill on being overly sensitive.\n\nBecause of this, I’ve been thinking about finding my own therapist but I don’t know if it would be tacky of me to do that. She told me about *her* trauma and something that was very personal to *her* and I don’t know if I have a right to piggyback off of her trauma.\n\nWhat do you think?",

And after these words I just started sobbing because it was so touching to hear that she cares and that she appreciates seeing me.

I recently had my first art show -- a big achievement for me and something we've worked towards -- and my T floated the idea of coming to support it, if I felt comfortable with it. I said I would be happy to have them there. They asked if their friend and partner could come, and I said sure but to tell them I am your client.\n\nMaybe I did something wrong but it was painful. Usually my T comes out of their office to greet me in the waiting room, and everything feels comfortable and warm. They are psychodynamic. At the show, it felt like my T was heavily guarded and short. I didn't even know what to say with their guests near them (I can't ask T personal questions), except talk about my work, but I did everything I could to just be a good host. I just wanted them to have a good time and enjoy the exhibit, like I wanted everyone else who attended to have a good time.\n\nMaybe I'm just venting/sad but it just felt like my therapist (the version I know at least) wasn't there. I guess I was just hoping for like a minute, they would pull me aside, and we could interact like we do in session. But it just felt like rupture city.\n\nUsually I look forward to my session each week but I am now dreading this. And I don't want to go to a different T.

    "selftext": "From wikipedia: “In aesthetics, the uncanny valley is a hypothesized relationship between the degree of an object's resemblance to a human being and the emotional response to such an object (...) Mori's original hypothesis states that as the appearance of a robot is made more human, some observers' emotional response to the robot becomes increasingly positive and empathetic, until it reaches a point beyond which the response quickly becomes strong revulsion” (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley)\n\nSome of us never or rarely had someone listen to us, show empathy/sympathy, validate our feelings or even show us we have the right to exist. Then you start therapy and (ideally) find all those things coming from the therapist, which feels so nice and warm in the beginning. But of course you get attached, how could you not? And then this amazing thing that felt wonderful has a dark side to it. You start to feel that something is wrong. You don’t have this in real life outside from therapy. And your therapist cannot be part of your “real life”. \n\nIt is both a real and a not real relationship. It is true connection but also just a professional relationship. Like it is both human and not human.\nAnd you start to despise it?\n\nI’ve never been great verbalizing my thoughts, but i hope this post made sense.\n\nDoes anyone else feel like this?",

    "selftext": "So, in the title, I've been kinda feeling weird the past week and wondering if I'm completely weird or alone here.\n\nSo, about a year ago, on my own I came up with the idea of reparenting myself by \"enrolling myself\" in scouting.  Basically, trying to get outside to adventure more and seeing how many merit badges I could \"earn\".  I never got to have this opportunity as a kid.  I decided to start all the way back at the first cub scout rank and got the handbook and badges that came with it as well as a representative lion tshirt. \n\nWell, it's been a pretty cool experience so far but the past year I'd always be showing up to session wearing my lion tshirt.  Id also be sharing some of my scouting activities with my therapist but without saying the context.  He definitely noticed me always wearing the lion shirt but I'd never tell him the reason until like two weeks ago.  \n\nI got the guts finally to tell him two sessions ago and remember being all excited to share.  My therapist had no idea this was the reason behind the lion shirt.  He thought this reparenting idea was genius and got excited.  I started telling him about the next scouting project, designing and building a Pinewood Derby car.    Then, idk how to describe but he starts waxing poetic the Pinewood Derby and then it hits me how he was probably a scout back in the day or was a scouting dad with his kid way back.  \n\nIt's like my broken attached self felt shame for my fake pathetic experiences compared to his definite real experiences.  I know the answer is to try and bring this up next session but I have to sit with this a couple more days.\n\nHas anyone here had something similar happen? Am I crazy?",

    "selftext": "My partner has been meeting with his therapist weekly since January. He told her that we were looking into couples therapy and she responded that I was welcome to join in their sessions for couples counseling. \n\nThe three of us meet every other week now. In general, it was nice to have a neutral ground to express ourselves. But throughout the weeks, she has connected our issues to my partners anxiety, ADHD and perfectionism — something she hasn’t been able to do for me because we haven’t met individually nor was there an intake for me. \n\nYesterday, we wanted to talk about an argument we had over the weekend — where I was showing my partner a very important place of my upbringing and we disagreed on how much weed he had ingested before we went. We had apologized and overcome it, however wanted to dig deeper on it today.\n\nAfter we both shared our sides of the story, she immediately looked at me and said that I need to be more assertive and that he can’t read my mind. I found myself trying to defend why I hesitated to speak up, but it just kept coming back to me needing to speak up more. She had no comment for my partner. \n\nI ended up breaking down from the stress of that situation. I felt unheard and dismissed. She then acknowledged I was becoming emotional and that she doesn’t know my traumas. She then complimented me and said “You rock! Look at your life, you have a lot to be proud of, don’t be so hard on yourself.” \n\nThe session ended and I was panting in anxiousness. I struggle with social anxiety and I’m working on this with my own therapist, who doesn’t approve of these “couple sessions” with my partner’s therapist. \n\nNow, I’m left conflicted on if I am upset just because I was constructively criticized or because it was an unprofessional interaction to be in with a therapist. But I feel crazy for being as upset and triggered as I am.  \n\nTLDR; My partner’s long term therapist offered to be our couples therapist. She addresses his ADHD and depression to our relationship issues, yet has not done an intake or individual assessment for me. Yesterday, she gave me triggering criticism where I felt I couldn’t defend/explain myself. Despite being diagnosed with my own therapist for severe anxiety, I’m now confused if I am just struggling to hear the hard truth or if it should have been handled differently.\n\nUpdate: Talked to my individual therapist and feel a lot better. Both about stopping seeing this other therapist and how I was made to feel at the end of the session (that I wrote about above). I feel less crazy and am thankful for the comments and expertise you guys have offered. Thank you.",

    "selftext": "So. Little background. I'm female, my therapist male. I've been in 1× week sessions with him since June. And for the most part I genuinely look forward to our sessions and value the perspectives they bring me. I think that therapy is helping me with my issues with low self image, self esteem, boundaries and depression and anxiety.  \n\nSince my self image, particularly my appearance is a source of anxiety and stress for me we've talked about the issue before. I once had a particularly vulnerable day and was crying, talking about how I feel so ugly and that makes me feel worthless. We spoke about a lot during that session, but he also was trying to boost my confidence and kept reassuring me I was beautiful and that a lot of men, not just my husband,  would want me (his words). He said it maybe one too many times because I started to feel odd. So first instance. \n\nThen, several weeks later, i was feeling particularly good. Had been feeling increasingly confident and good about myself. On an upswing I had fixed my hair and wore eye makeup and some lipstick for my day, which happened to include the therapy session as well as some work meetings. It was not heavy makeup and I felt positive. I began therapy session and first thing he said after the customary how are you today was well I see you are wearing makeup. It was said in a sort of flat way. So I said yes,  sometimes i wear makeup when I want a boost or just when I'm feeling good. I like makeup. I enjoy it. I was smiling at that point thinking he would tell me he could sense this meant a positive thing for my mental outlook. Instead he said, i don't like makeup really. I prefer when women don't wear it. I think they look better without and it's fake. I rebutted with women don't wear makeup for men....or for you. He kind of dropped it. But here's the thing. I felt deeply uncomfortable about that comment. He knows I'm sensitive to comments on my appearance. And he knows i trust his opinion. This was maybe 2 months ago now. I haven't worn makeup since to any of our sessions because i don't want him to bring it up again. But when i think of this, it makes me upset. I want to bring it up. But i have issues with confrontation and I've been in relationship where I've been gaslit. So i now worry that maybe it was an innocent comment and Im blowing it out of proportion. I need some other perspective. Anyone have thoughts on this? Was his comment acceptable and I'm being sensitive?",

Then I’m like hello my partner is with my dog all day long, she could probably use a little extra exercise in this rainy cold day but she is honestly okay. She then walks back her reaction and says oh yes someone is home with your dogs during the day that’s right, I guess it’s fine, just that sometimes it gets to a point hearing people’s pets unhappy where you just want to say “walk your f***ing dog.” But that she knows that’s not my dog right now. Ummm... okay? Super weird? She then just goes right back to trying to facilitate the session and I’m totally distracted of course and then thankfully it all just ended. It was really bizarre.

    "selftext": "Hi there,\n\nI've noticed referral links for BetterHelp being offered on Reddit to people inquiring about the service. By using said link, both the person providing it and the person using it get one week of free service on BetterHelp.\n\nThat means clients actively look for new clients on behalf of this business, who in turn would be looking for new clients, to get a free week.\n\nIf I'm not mistaking, people turn to the platform for help with mental health issues, and not to be pulled into a marketing scheme, so the company can expand. This is very reminiscent of an MLM.\n\nAnd please keep in mind that if you were seeing a therapist through a legitimate practice, their licence would forbid them from engaging in other relationships with the client, such as promotion. They get away with this because they are the middle man.\n\nThis is just unethical when providing mental health services. Or claiming to provide them, more like it.\n\nLater Edit\n\nTo better put this into context, aside from the aforementioned sales tactic, the following is known about this company:\n\n1. Their TOS don't guarantee that the client will receive any part of the service they advertise, even after having paid in advance.\n2. There are hundreds of complaints all over the Internet from former and current clients detailing that the service is not at all as advertised, many saying they feel ripped off.\n3. There are abysmal reviews from former counsellors on dedicated sites, some mentioning alarming practices related to confidentiality, as well as receiving low pay through a complicated system. The same reviews mention that the platform makes their job difficult in many ways.\n4. The company's excellent ratings on various sites cannot be trusted either, as they engage in posting paid/fake reviews to create a positive image. There are sites claiming to review the service, which at first glance appear objective, yet prove to be affiliated with BH, demoting those so-called reviews to the status of masked ads.\n5. The company targets clients who are both vulnerable (seeking help for mental health issues) and financially disadvantaged. The incentive for them to participate in this sales tactic is therefore greater and differs from similar tactics employed by other companies, through the nature of the situation. It directly links people's ability to acess mental health services with their success in promoting the company, if they cannot afford to pay the full amount required. There is therefore an added amount of pressure to be successful in that regard, and morally, it is wrong for this company to put vulnerable people in that position so they can profit.\n6. A journalistic investigation in February of this year by a publication called Jezebel has revealed that BH sends metadata in real time to social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram and Pinterest, as well as to a data analytics firm, MixPanel. This data is very detailed and includes clients' every interaction with the platform, minus the actual content. The content however is routinely accessed by BH employees, as a former counsellor detailed in a review (not the only one to signal this). For instance, employees would listen in on sessions to evaluate the counsellor's performance and inform them of this afterwards. The service is not confidential.",

Not the state my therapist is licensed in.\n\nI spent the week so elated for my family and so sad for me, frantically trying to brainstorm ideas to continue working with her. And then I saw my therapist yesterday. I told her the news and she was really happy for us. It was nice to share good news and she seemed genuinely excited for us. Then, before I could start admitting to her the lengths I'd gone to mentally in trying to come up with ways I could keep working with her (sponsoring her to get licensed in new state? flights back to the home state airport for a quick meeting and turn around every other week? rent a square foot of a friend's house so I can have legal residency here still?), she said, \"Just so you know, Hunger Ghost, we can keep doing our work if that's what you prefer; I'm licensed in Other Country (where she currently lives; we do Telehealth) and it allows me to provide therapy worldwide. I can see you under that license if continuing our work is what works best for you.\"\n\nMe, realizing I don't even have to admit to how worried I've been. \"Yep, that sounds good.\" Me, pushing myself for a little vulnerability: \"That's a relief. I was worried.\" (Understatement of the year.)\n\nTherapist: \"I know, Hunger Ghost.\"\n\nThere's so much bad stuff that happens. Including in therapy. But sometimes good things happen, too. Would love to hear if anyone's had a good story to share; something from life or the therapy office.",

My therapist often extends the offer of having a brief chat between sessions if I need it but I normally don't take her up on it because I worry about being a burden.\n\nHowever this morning, amongst the panic from last night, I texted my therapist very early telling her what had happened. She replied within 30 mins and said she had time for a phonecall if I needed or wanted it. I accepted her offer. \n\nWe chatted for 15 minutes. She listened to my problem, validated my feelings and helped me consider my options and sort out a short term plan that doesn't overwhelm me and seems sensible. \n\nBecause of her, I now feel able to do everything I need to do today and things feel more manageable. I feel able to take on what the week wants to throw at me. The noise has reduced slightly. I told her how much I appreciate her and I really hope she knows how sincere I am.

    "selftext": "It’s been a few years and I’m still processing the PTSD I experienced from a completely awful work situation. I’ve since done EMDR and other modalities that have been helpful.  Long before that though and a year after my total of 4 years in a toxic work environment, I sought therapy for depression. I was so in shock and denial that my dream job was treating me so poorly. At the time, my kind & well intentioned therapist used CBT and really seemed to be trying his best to convince me what was happening wasn’t actually THAT BAD. After all, it was a great company, right? Well, yes. “But...” It’s as if every alarm bell in my mind and body was ringing to gtfo, and I was in such a deep state of denial. I was in therapy to help sort through it all and looking back, he did not help me sort through it in an empowering way.  He did keep me coping mechanisms to help convince me to tolerate the abuse way longer than I should have. I put SO much work into CBT, and really valued his perspective at the time as I thought I was going crazy. \n\nTo this day, I’m resentful that my well-intentioned therapist didn’t do more to validate the effed up nature of the situation. Instead, I was convinced by my therapist “there is no threat, your mind is overreacting to an imaged or perceived threat”. Actually no, this was the reality. There was a MASSIVE issue and my body and mind were right all along. When I got out, life improved dramatically. Thanks, therapist for an additional level of invalidation and gas lighting I didn’t need. I feel like rather than validating, T used CBT to try to “fix” or the CBT favorite “reframe” ie question your gut/initial reaction in a terrible situation that needed an exit plan, not a fix. As therapists, how do you help a client determine what is right? \n\n\nAny suggestions for moving on from the resentment towards my therapist? I really wish I had the confidence and had left sooner and even though he was PP, the T worked to keep me there as long as possible. The invalidation of the shittiness of my experience really effed me up and now just feels like it was more gaslighting of a different kind. Ugh.",

I was definitely attached to him.\n\nMy grandma died after a year long battle with cancer on a Sunday, and the following Tuesday I had a session where I told him she had finally passed (i had kept him updated about her condition every session prior), and it was probably the most raw I had ever felt emotionally. A half hour in, he said that he had gotten a new job and was going to have to scale back his private practice. He asked me what I still wanted to work on in therapy and i think I said like I wanted to keep working on how to deal with my anxiety and things like that. He pulled out a piece of paper with another therapist’s name and email on it and told me she was accepting new patients so I could email her. He said it had been a pleasure watching me grow, and I left. \n\nThat was it. I remember being shocked and so sad. He never contacted me again, not to check in or to make sure that I didn’t need any other recommendations if the other therapist he suggested didn’t work out. I feel like this was even more difficult because my grandma had JUST died. I never emailed the new therapist because I didn’t feel like starting over. Fast forward about a year, I finally reached out to a new therapist and have been seeing her for about 6 months now. I feel like I have let myself get way too attached to her and it’s causing me a lot of stress and anxiety because I can’t shake the super strong thought that she is going to leave me. Like I’m constantly terrified she’s going to move away, get a new job, or terminate. \n\nI guess my question is, is this thought linked to the abrupt loss of my old therapist? Or is something wrong with me? I really want to get this figured out so that I can feel better. Was what my old therapist did the usual way that therapy is supposed to end? He was my first therapist so I have nothing to compare it to.",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone, I wanted to reach out to this community with a bit of a pickle I'm in.\n\nLast month, I started seeing a new therapist after moving to a new city. It was honestly slim-pickin's and I was really at the end of my rope, so I was absolutely elated to find someone in my network that was a specialist in the issues I wanted treatment for. I reached out through PsychologyToday and we scheduled an intake appointment for teletherapy. Prior to the appointment, I sent them a copy of my insurance information for them to confirm that I was in network.\n\nThe intake appointment went alright, I wasn't sure we clicked but I was willing to try it out for a few more sessions. I disclosed a lot of information to this therapist about my issues and what I was looking to work on with them, and they seemed really excited to work with me too. That said, there were definitely a couple red flags. Just on the surface level, they were late and kept moving around their apartment/office during the session. That was annoying, but it wasn't super weird to me. When I answered the video call, their picture didn't really look like the photo they had on PsychologyToday. I chalked it up to just weird lighting. I paid the co-pay over Venmo, which made me a little uncomfortable, but they handled their business through Square, Venmo, and/or PayPal so I didn't have much of a choice. We scheduled my next appointment and I paid my copay and the appointment ended. A couple days later they sent me a copy of my payment invoice that I requested for my records. \n\nThe day and time for the next appointment rolled around and there is radio silence. No link for the video call, no text or email, no nothing. I thought they could have been running late, but 30 minutes after the appointment was supposed to start, with me reaching out twice, I figured it was a lost cause and I gave up. 24 hours went by and I hadn't heard anything from this therapist about rescheduling or any attempt to contact me about missing the appointment. I'm going to leave my emotion out of this as much as I can but I was absolutely gutted.\n\nA few days later, I sent them an email explaining how disappointed I was in their services and that I would be terminating my time with their services. This was to cover my own ass, but also I wanted to see if I could get one last response from them. Nothing.\n\nHere's some other notable information. Their profile in PsychologyToday looks legit, but their practice has no website. There is a website that shows up when you search the practice on Google, but when you click on it, the link gives you an error message. This therapist has two last names, and when I searched both on Google, I didn't find that much. I found an interview they did with some small newspaper as well as websites like PsychologyToday and ZocDoc, but nothing official like a Linkedin profile. Speaking of ZocDoc, I did find a review of them posted by someone who was also ghosted by this therapist, so this isn't the first time they have done this. I searched their license number in my state's directory, and they are a legitimate therapist with a legitimate license. Also, there was an office manager listed at the end of the invoice, but when I did a little Google searching, I couldn't find any record of that name associated with the practice or the therapist.\n\nI'm really upset that a therapist would pull something like this. I think, at best, they realized they couldn't get any money out of me (my copay is pretty low), and just ghosted me. Regardless, this is absolutely unacceptable, and I wanted to know if there's anyway I can report them to my state or to some higher body, mainly for my own justice but also to keep them from doing this to other patients. It's not right.\n\nWhat do you all think?",

I think a lot of us (myself included) feel compelled to play the role of an ideal client, like we can’t reveal our true selves and we have to diminish our problems to avoid becoming a burden to our therapist. Maybe sometimes even being a good client isn't enough; we have to be the *best* client so our therapist will like us the most and give us the very best care.\n\nI was raised to believe my self-worth is based on my performance and how I present myself, so the thought of showing my ugly side to my therapist goes against every fiber of my being, like I'm practically asking them to hurt and abandon me. But this kind of defeats the purpose; why am I seeking help from this person if I'm not letting them see the parts of me that need help the most? It's kind of like inviting a plumber into your home only to show off your furniture. (Not the best comparison, but it's the first that came to mind.)\n\nI’m starting to realize that the growth and healing I hope to gain from therapy exist entirely outside the reward systems built into our culture, and my urge to please and impress my therapist isn't doing me any favors. This might be obvious to many of you but this was a major news flash to me.\n\nI thought that smoothing over the messy parts was the \"right\" way to be a client, so as a result of my internalized shame and humiliation, I presented a filtered, incomplete version of myself in therapy. I think I understand now that I was mistaken; allowing myself to be vulnerable is the only way I'll receive the care I need, and I think my challenge now is to stop pretending, to lean into the safety and compassion my therapist stubbornly keeps offering me, and to trust that nothing awful is going to happen if I stop hiding and let myself be seen.\n\nIt feels terrifying and insanely counterintuitive and I don't know how to do it, but right now I'm just proud of realizing that it's the thing I need to work on. Could it be that I ought to be genuine with the person committed to helping me? What a concept.",

He responded with:\n\n“With regards to power dynamics, there is also a client-therapist power dynamic where the therapist's professional integrity is on the line and the client has the power to complain to relevant professional bodies etc. so it is not simply a one-way thing.”\n\nFor one thing, a client does not have “power” to report to professional bodies, the professional bodies have the power, and the client has a right to contact them if necessary.

    "title": "So that was an unexpected outcome of a \"light\" session! (T sexual abuse etc)",
    "selftext": "So I had a session on Friday morning, and this time we did something different, where I had to sit in a different chair and  speak from the view of the \"detached\" part of me that comes up whenever I am feeling stressed or anxious, and just switches off emotions. We spoke about where that part of me comes from, what age it began to come out to protect me, what purpose it serves/served, how it helped me survive some pretty awful things as a young kid and a teenager. Then I sat in the other chair, and spoke as ME, about how I felt hearing those things the other part/mode of me had to say, how it helped me understand more, and identify how those old patterns of protecting myself impact me now and restrict how I interact with others and also with myself. At the time, I thought it was kind of lame and that nothing revelatory had happened, because I already \"knew\" all that stuff that I switch off emotions to stay safe/feel numb. Also it was the last session for a month till after Christmas, so I was purposely not wanting to do anything too heavy and I felt it had been a pretty light session.\n\nBut then an hour after leaving, around mid-afternoon, I started feeling really panicky and felt so many triggers come up for me which normally aren't an issue nowadays, things that reminded me of the sexual abuse when I was a kid, like how the wind in the trees outside, the sunlight at that time of day, and the sound of my ceiling fans, and how the breeze from the fan on my skin, all reminded me of the abuse, I guess the things I focused on when it would happen. I haven't thought about those details in years. But I know I have to be out of the house or busy at that time of day every day because I get really down if I'm just sitting at home - I have just never linked it directly to being behaviours to avoid triggers of the abuse, which happened in a quiet home, in the mid afternoon. I just always told myself I was one of those people who couldn't sit still and had to be busy.\n\nSo after the session I started to feel so dissociated, like I was floating and separate from everybody. It felt almost unbearable, my head felt like it was going to explode, my skin was crawling, I felt like I couldn't breathe and couldn't stop thinking about it all - I was about to cancel all my appointments then and there and go and talk to my GP about medication instead - full escape/avoid mode!\n\nAnd then last night, a day and a half later, I was trying all my tools to try to feel better and ground myself, and eventually I took 5 minutes out to write about how I felt, and in doing that I identified these feelings and memories were coming from that really young part of me that I sort of \"spoke on behalf of\" in my session, from when I first started acting in this detached, protective way to hide and cover up the abuse, to focus on other people's needs so they didn't notice me, and didn't notice that actually I was a worthless and disgusting person.\n\nWithin 30 minutes of writing about the triggers and my feelings and the intrusive memories, the anxiety, the chest clenching feeling of panic, the feeling of not being \"here\", it all just left. More so than I have felt in a long, long time. I felt calm, balanced, centred and whole. I haven't had that feeling of calm for a very long time. Maybe through this session, and then also actually acknowledging my feelings after it, I finally LISTENED to the young child part of me that has been silent for so long, the one I normally ignore or tell to shut up because nobody gives a shit, the abuse wasn't that bad, etc etc. I've always told myself (and others) that the abuse when I was a kid really didn't affect me all that much, it wasn't that bad, and worse things have happened. Maybe for now, that part of me feels heard, accepted and validated for surviving the abuse and coping with it in whatever way possible, and has finally had a chance to speak..\n\nIt was a good feeling, and it still is. I am hoping it sticks around! Amazing to think that a session I felt was fairly harmless and pretty lame resulted in all of this. All this does actually do something!! ;)",

Because I now live out of state, we are doing virtual sessions, and I’ve done 6 sessions so far. The sessions are close to $300 each so I’ve already spent quite a bit, which is why I’m hesitant to switch to a new therapist so quickly. \n\nAt my most most recent session, he mentioned that he will be in the city where I currently live this weekend for a family wedding. He mentioned that he would like to grab coffee with me, and I figured that he meant an in person session. Previously his office told me that legally he can only be considered a life coach if we do not have in person sessions, as I do not reside in the same state as him. I thought he meant that we could do an in person session at a local coffee shop so that I could be considered an official patient. \n\nI told him I will be working during the morning time on the days that he is here, so a morning coffee meeting probably wouldn’t work. He then said that we could go out after I get off of work and that it didn’t matter how late. His exact words were that “there are lots of lounges and restaurants nearby” and that “we can go out, grab some drinks, and just vibe.” He repeated that last sentence a few times and kept mentioning going out for drinks together and “just chilling” or “just vibing.”\n\nI was thrown off by what he said and didn’t know how to respond so I just said oim not sure what my schedule is like, and let’s see. He told me that he would have his secretary reach out to schedule a time for us to go out when he arrives in town, but I later called to cancel my next appointment.\n\nI am feeling weird about the situation and my first instinct was that it seemed unprofessional, but I don’t know if I’m overreacting. I’ve already invested quite a bit of money and time so I don’t want to jump to a new therapist without thinking things through. Part of me wonders if he was just trying to be nice. Any advice or thoughts would be appreciated.\n\nEDITED TO ADD: On his website he is listed as clinical psychologist, therapist, life coach, and corporate coach. He told me that because I am out of state the most he can do is be my life coach because of a legal technicality, but that we can still do things I would normally do in therapy. I’m not sure how much of a difference this makes. ",

    "selftext": "So I'm a 20 year old girl who's been trying to get in therapy for panic attacks and dissociation, and basically I found an office that told me to come in for a consultation so I can explain my issues and they'll assign me to a therapist there that would be the best match for me. So I check in, and this man takes me to the next room (mind you this isn't even my actual therapist yet, this is just the guy doing the consultation that's supposed to ask me questions). I sit across the room but he tells me to sit in the chair closest to him. He starts asking me questions, they start off pretty normal, like \"are you depressed/suicidal\", \"do you get feelings of hopelessness\", yknow, typical therapist questions.. I tell him that I do get depressed, and he says \"even though you are so beautiful?\" I accept the compliment, and then he proceeds to say \"You know what you should do? Whenever you're feeling bad about yourself, put on your nicest dress, look at yourself in the mirror, and slowly undress so you can look at your body and see how beautiful and perfect you are.\" So that was weird, cause why would the guy doing a consultation suggest I get naked to feel better about myself.. I brushed it off, but then it got weirder: He asked how my sex life is, I said \"It's fine\" hoping that would be a brief question. He then asked more about it, I thought this might be about pregnancy so I said \"I have a girlfriend so there's no chance of pregnancy or anything.\" (i'm a lesbian) and he says \"Ohhh you have a girlfriend.. so you've never had sex with a man? Never ever ever??\" and I said no. He then said \"What about toys?\" I was starting to get really uncomfortable with these questions, so I asked \"Are you supposed to be asking me this? I don't think these are necessary questions.\" He said that they are necessary, and that my therapist would eventually ask all this anyway. He started naming scenarios of me and my girlfriend using \"fake penises\" and then proceeded to ask if I've ever had gang or group sex. At this point it didn't feel like he was just doing his job anymore, it felt like he was trying to picture me in sexual situations. By the end of the appointment I was very confused, I don't understand why a simple therapy consultation would be filled with such pornographic questions like that. I was in there to manage my panic attacks, sex wasn't even remotely related to any of the problems I was expressing I had to him. Can someone please tell me if this is normal behavior/questions for a therapist to ask or was that completely inappropriate? Any takes are appreciated.",

    "selftext": "Today I spoke with my therapist about feeling very depressed and hopeless, possibly a little suicidal. Similar feelings to what lead up to an attempt earlier this year. I’m bipolar and learning to recognize these patterns of depression so I thought it was a good thing. This was incredibly difficult for me because you know… vulnerability. I’ve been on a horrible roller coaster of mental health this past year and have only recently started medications for the bipolar. If I consider this objectively, yeah no wonder I’m so depressed. It’s been a *hard* year. \n\nHis response to all of this was “then why the fuck are you here wasting my time when I have clients who actually want to live and improve their life knocking on my door? You’re wasting both of our time if you’re going to just kill yourself anyways.”\nI told him this was hurtful and he pretty much said “yeah I tried a tactic and it didn’t work haha”. \n\nHe also told me that he had considered dropping me as a client following the attempt because if I had been successful I could have cost him his license. I guess this is due to the fact that I never communicated where I was at mentally with him and he feels like he can’t trust me. \nI have an email typed up but I worry that I’m coming across too emotional and I want to be able to articulate myself in a respectful yet assertive manner. I don’t feel that I deserve to be treated so harshly and knowing he almost dropped me may be true but I don’t think it was helpful for me to know that. \n\nI also feel that the difference between this time and the last is that I’m asking for help, I’m being transparent, and doing my best to remain vulnerable. I left the appointment today feeling so ashamed and embarrassed, I wish I had never said anything and if I’m being honest, I want to say hurtful things.",

    "selftext": "Hello, this is my first time posting on Reddit, so sorry if I do anything wrong. I just wanted to know if this is ok for my therapist to do. I’m not really sure what is right or wrong for therapists to be doing. I also dunno how to tell if a therapist is actually helping me either.\n\nSo basically I’m a teenager and I’ve been through about maybe 5 or so therapists. Most have been in person but the last two have been virtual. My first virtual therapist was really nice but she quit or something and referred me to my current therapist. For the first couple of sessions she was sitting in a room with her camera on. Pretty normal. A couple of sessions ago, to my surprise, my therapist had her camera on and I could see her walking into a grocery store with the phone resting in the baby seat thing. I was a bit surprised, but I just figured that she has her own life to live and she shouldn’t put it on hold for me. Every session since then she’s been in her car which has made the connection pretty choppy. I really don’t know if I’m overreacting or something, can anybody please let me know?

    "selftext": "Part rant, part looking for advice.\n\nI’ve been with my therapist for about a year, and she’s supposed to be an experienced expert in one particular issue I deal with. However, I don’t think she actually is. I’ve expressed concern in session a couple of times that I didn’t feel any noticeable changes, didn’t have any new insights, and while I enjoy talking to her (she is very validating and supportive) I just don’t feel like I’m getting “better” or making progress. \n\nAfter our last session, I sent her an email expressing those concerns again (she had previously said it was fine to correspond with her via email and she had many clients who did). I asked about whether or not I should be working with someone with different qualifications to better serve my needs or whether there was anything I could do to better understand my treatment plan or why I wasn’t feeling any better. \n\nAfter nearly a week of not responding, she finally emailed me back a short response saying that she has cancelled all our future sessions and I am “no longer a client” of her practice. \n\nI was shocked and doubly devastated to hear this. I still don’t know if it’s me (am I doing something wrong in therapy?) or her (is she really under qualified?) and I am just completely frustrated and devastated to have spent thousands of dollars (out of pocket, since the insurance doesn’t cover seeing a “specialist”) on something that has failed me and quite honestly, has made me feel worse. I have been left feeling like there is something innately wrong with me, since she has a long waiting list of clients so clearly her therapy works for other people? And by being dropped as a client, I’ve also completely given up hope of EVER feeling better. I guess I just thought that she believed in me, and I trusted that she could help me feel better, but now I feel like a sucker and a cash cow. But she was also so nice to me, so I feel like a giant dick on the other hand. \n\nNow, I feel like I’ve just wasted a year of my life on something that didn’t work. That’s a huge opportunity cost, as well as thousands of dollars down the drain. Honestly, I almost feel like I’ve been scammed. On the other hand, she was so nice to me, so I feel really confused and heartbroken on top of devastated and really just hopeless about dealing with my issue. I emailed her back, expressing my shock and confusion, but I’ve yet to hear back after a couple of days. \n\nI’m devastated, and I don’t know what to do. Please help me sort this out?\n\nI’ve tried out several other therapists in the past, but never really connected or felt comfortable with them, and never lasted more than a couple sessions. I was really optimistic about her, since she was (allegedly?) a specialist, and I stuck with it for nearly a year. I’m really not up for finding a new therapist and starting over, but I don’t think my relationship with this one is repairable either. Please help. \n\n\nPS If this post doesn’t follow the rules, could you please gently suggest a better sub to post to?",

    "title": "Sudden Termination Nightmare / Don't think I believe in therapy anymore",
    "selftext": "Sorry for the incredibly long post in advance! I thought about trying to make this brief, but I guess here is the long and the short of it because I want to put it all somewhere for now:\n\n(and just in case -- TL;DR my therapist who I had a genuinely good, kind, loving relationship with terminated me out of nowhere after 4.5. years, gave me no reason, gave me no referrals, stonewalled me, and now, even though she knows the ins and outs of all my deepest shame and trauma, is likely someone I will never encounter again in my life. That is genuinely traumatizing.)  \n\n\nI had a therapist for 4.5 years who I genuinely respected, appreciated, and (therapeutically-appropriately) loved. I started with her in 2017 and since I have been in treatment with her, twice a week, every Monday and Thursday for 4 years (2017-2022), I have completely changed my life (for the better) in many ways. She was an incredible ally to me, she was incredibly consistent, she was extremely present when I went through a terrible crisis with a partner in severe, active addiction needing hospitals/police/etc, and she knew everything about my past because she made me feel so safe and got me to open up: my trauma, parentification, complete emotional and physical neglect by my parents, CSA, etc. I don't post here much, but if you go back through my reddit history, i am sure there are plenty of posts and comments praising her, thanking her, describing what a good job I thought she was doing. I really, really believed she was very good.  \nFast forward to November 2021. We are doing well, fine, normal, I think. Having productive sessions. We are starting to re-process a story about a sexual assault i experienced in college, that we'd talked about in 2018 but she thought we needed to revisit because we'd been waylayed by other stuff. We have our Monday session pre-thanksgiving. It was a really deep but really good session, IMHO. She mentions at the end of that session we wouldn't be meeting Thursday because of thanksgiving and also that shes going to be raising her rates next year, but wouldn't be giving clients all details about the changes until December. So the holiday week goes by like normal (I had no reason to reach out or hear from her), bu then Sunday night, November 28, I shoot her an email (between-session contact is fine) saying I realize that our session the next morning wasn't going to be technically December yet, but that I was wondering about her fee change she mentioned and if she would talk to me about it in session in the AM, because it was ALMOST December. She writes back quickly with a form email that includes my new fee for the next year. It's quite a bit higher--50 dollars more per session, but oh well -- I had no plans to do anything but keep going at the higher rate. I respond briefly and thank her and say we can talk about whatever else in the AM.  \nMonday morning, November 29, 12 hours after that email, we have our regular session over facetime. She answers and I say my usual (polite tic) \"how are you?\" and then she immediately answers rapidly \"Not good this relationship is no longer working for me and I am terminating therapy,\" Ummm WHAT? I literally said, \"You're joking right?\" And the answer was \"No, I am terminating with you.\" I blacked out after that. Honestly, I can barely remember the session except I was crying and saying I was really confused about what happened, and she basically had no answer, except a slew of excuses/answers that made no real sense together \"You could just never feel safe around me\" and \"I damaged the relationship too much to be saved.\" (??) (This is COMPLETELY untrue, I was talking to her about the details of a sexual assault, I had been securely attached to her for more than 4 years, and I had disclosed graphic details of CSA to her multiple times. I felt safe, and I feel like that's on me to decide, not her.) I kept asking her if it was about the fee, if it was about something that happened on thanksgiving (I had no idea what she was doing on thanksgiving but i was grasping in that moment) , etc. She just kept saying no. We ended the session without her giving me any referrals, but saying she'd see me as usual through the month of December and I'd need to start with someone by January 1.  \nI was devastated. I had a legitimate panic attack that required meds after the session. I was certain I could fix the whole situation or clear something up. I wrote her a really kind, really clear email telling her I didn't want to terminate, that I felt that we'd be able to talk through whatever was making her feel this way. I got no response, showed up to Thursday therapy, and she said she'd deleted the email and not read it because she \"didn't want to negotiate\" and from there on out it was just session after session of her being completely cold, shut down, stonewalling me, barely talking. The friday of that first week I texted her telling her I was having such a hard time, that I knew she wasnt going to be my therapist soon but that I didn't have any other mental health help yet and could she provide me some resources to help me get through this or some referrals to talk to because the shock and the trauma was debilitating. I wasn't functioning She didn't respond to that truly suffering text (she is a very communicative therapist via text), BUT the next day she \"texted\" an invoice from venmo (which she has NEVER done once before in 4 years -- I have never ONCE gotten any kind of invoice from her) spelling out what I would owe her for the remainder of our sessions. It was....horrifying. It seemed psychopathic.  It was like a human I had never encountered before. It looked like my therapist on the facetime screen, and the texts came from her number. but nothing about her was like the therapist i had had for 4 years. It was honestly terrifying and traumatizing.  \nDuring this process, i'd staunchly announced to the people in my life i was done with therapy and never going to be in it again. But then I stopped being able to function, lost a big client because I couldn't work, alternated bouts of panicking or crying, and obsessively talking to my partner and friends about what was happening, trying to deduce or puzzle out what I could have done to cause this, how I was sure it must be my fault. I stopped sleeping and being able to eat. At some point (i think when I lost the job), my partner told me NOT seeking professional help was NOT an option. I agreed but only to go see someone for the short term, to work through this loss, because, I was trying to just get over it and move on but I couldn't. I couldn't shake the grief at all. I was living in basically a dissociated trauma state all the time.  \nI contacted an old couples therapist who my partner and I had seen together once who agreed to see me as an individual. She knows my therapist (and me bc of previous therapy) because we all live in a small town, and when she heard my story she was shocked and appalled and confused and actually concerned for the therapist because it seemed like something was happening for her/to her. She told me that I didn't have to keep going to the sessions with my therapist until the final date that we'd set, because I didn't owe her anything. And I knew she was right, but I kept feeling determined to find the \"other version\" of my therapist i had known, the warm and caring and loving one --- i was certain i'd come to one session and she'd be back to her old self. but i never saw that version of her again- Just someone completely cold and different. (i was totally splitting her -- just truly traumatized and regressing)  \nAt some point in early-December, we both agreed that we didn't need so many termination sessions (me and my terminating therapist). And we ended up just doing two more instead of 10 -- i think they were torturing both of us. Each session was literally just me crying and asking for more clarification and her either saying nothing or offering me explanations for terminating that were like \"You said you wanted boundaries from your therapist and I am not a \"boundaries gal\"\" (and i was like -- yes, you are, you are literally a boundaries gal professionally for a living. that is what you get paid to be.) She said at our last session she would speak to the positive side of therapy and let me know how I'd grown and what I should tell my new therapist I needed to work on (at this point she hadn't even asked if I had a therapist or offered me referrals or anything).\n\nFinally, our last session happened on 12/23. I showed up, and finally able to access some anger, let her know that even though she had said she wanted to tell me about the growth she saw in me during this session, I needed to be very frank with her: her treatment was unacceptable, that it was undoing all the attachment and fear of abandonment work we had done for years, undoing all of the progress that we'd made, that she had violated her licensing board's ethical code - and I read the part about terminaton out loud to her and pointed out each way she'd violated it and told her I couldn't understand why she would choose to behave this way, and I told her that I felt it was all legitimately tragic because so much had gone into this relationship. Money, time, energy, care, etc. I told her that I wasn't sure about applying for social work programs anymore because I was torn: I either NEED to become one so I can stop this from happening to more vulnerable people from therapists who are not capable of being therapists---- or I need to NEVER apply to be one because I don't actually believe in it as a practice anymore. And then, after that comment, for the last 20 minutes of that last session, my therapist softened and her voice changed and I finally recognized her again -- and she started to cry and apologized over and over again- and said she knew she had mishandled this and was sorry. That she'd done a bad job and that she knew it and she couldn't fix it (sorry, yes she could have.) Then she shared some things about my progress, told me that she was doing this because she liked and loved and wanted the best for me, and then said she wished me well and hung up. I will say, there was some genuine relief and the TINIEST bit of closure seeing her that way. At least I knew that the person I had built such an alliance with actually existed and I hadn't been deluding myself.  \nIt's been about 8 weeks or something now. I still cry every day and sometimes I have no idea why except for the fact that I just actually miss her, I miss talking to her and processing things with her, but I am less obsessed over figuring out what happened -- it was clearly not something I did, even though in those stonewalling sessions she listed about 40 things i \"did wrong\" as a client. I am seeing my former couples therapist as an individual therapist and she's good but she and I just aren't the same kind of perfect fit my first therapist and I had been. But she's on my side, despite being former colleagues and acquaintances with my former therapist, and is talking through the process of deciding whether to report her or not. It all feels like some fucking bizarre twilight zone because i will tell you from the bottom of my heart I  DID NOT SEE THIS COMING OR IMAGINE THAT THIS WOULD EVER HAPPEN TO ME IN 10000 YEARS. NEVER, EVER, EVER. I used to read posts about sudden termination on this board and be like thank god I have my therapist because that's never going to happen to me.  \nWell, it did. And it was / is a genuine nightmare. The grief is very, very, very real - the lack of closure is torturous and my brain goes haywire at the thought of never ever talking to her again, after talking to her for \\~400 hours over 4 years, just me and her. Sure, we had our hiccups, we had two or three ruptures over 4 years, but we worked through anything between us extensively (i thought) and I was genuinely securely attached to her, and I really felt like things were solid and good. I feel duped and manipulated and like I have completely lost my belief in therapy as a genuine trustworthy healing modality (even as I work on applications for MSW programs). And I feel like maybe I haven't made as much progress as I thought, because maybe I overlooked red flags and got hurt by a narcissist yet again (my pattern I started therapy for).  \nMy current therapist is helping, she is working to get me to see that this couldn't be my fault, that some of the ruptures actually were probably red flags i didn't see, that this \"stonewalling\" version of my therapist is one overcome by shame and that she probably suffers from some kind of narcissism that does not allow her to be open or communicate with me at this point. When I feel panicked about never seeing this person ever again in my life, she also reminds me that there's a chance I could reach out for more closure in 6 mos to a year when things have changed for both of us, and things are deescalated a bit and my therapist isn't caught in whatever shame storm she's in, or that I may see her again if i have to testify against her, because even if I don't report her, my current therapist is leaning heavily towards that being necessary for her to do herself.  \nSo this is just to say to therapy clients -- even if you have the best therapist in the world, who is perfect and ethical and great, protect some part of your heart. Don't let yourself be completely vulnerable because at the end of the day they are inside your psyche in some manner, they have such power in the relationship and if something goes wrong or happens unexpectedly, it will undo you, like it did to me. Keep a little piece of yourself for yourself, so if they ever do something hurtful, you'll be somewhat prepared, and you'll have some part of you that feels unaffected.  \nAnd to therapists -- go to therapy. Work on your own fcking shit. My therapist was NOT in therapy and had not been in 20 years. She was a buddhist and religiously meditated and said she would go back to therapy \"should she ever need it\" -- but the reality is that she at some point must have really needed it, because whatever happened with her was something that she was feeling and experiencing that I was not clued in to, and also that she was not well-trained or tuned in enough to realize was her own stuff. Sure, maybe I or our dynamic was bringing it up in her, but it didn't ACTUALLY have to do with me. Or, at the very least, it shouldn't have been something I needed to bear the brunt of. I have so many therapist friends and loved ones (my partner is an analyst) and I've just been saying to all of them PLEASE learn how to manage or process the anger or fear or love or hatred or whatever countertransference feelings your clients are bringing up in you on your own time with your own healer or supervisor,  so you don't let them all come out and damage the vulnerable people who are looking to you for healing. It's life or death stuff.  \nSo, yeah. I used to really dig therapy and now I'm pretty sure it's kind of like playing some riskier version of Russian roulette. It really may not be worth it at the end of the day / 4.5 years.",

I'd sit there disliking myself. We terminated many months ago, and now we're in the middle of a time where life is so very precious and fragile for everyone.

I started balling because I really opened up about something for the first time regarding my mom, mind you in all the years I’ve seen my therapist I may have only cried like this 1 or 2 times prior. \n\nI curled up into a ball and laid my head on a pillow on the couch covering my face just crying and crying.\n\nAfter a while my therapist came over the to couch I was on and started rubbing my back while I cried, after a while she asked me if I could sit up, rub my feet on the floor, look around ect. \n\nI couldn’t really talk to explain what was going on, except to say I was angry at myself for crying like that.\n\nShe kept talking saying she was right there with me and that part of me was hiding when I was crying curled up, I leaned towards her as she sat sideways on the edge of the couch facing me. Finally acknowledging her. I don’t usually look at her eye to eye much not that I don’t want to\n\nThere was a pillow to her side near the back of the couch. I fell forward on that and put my arm around her crying again. She waited a few seconds and then asked me again if I could sit up. I didn’t sit up, (maybe she asked because I was in her space and it just wasn’t right to do that, I don’t know) I pulled my arm from around her and curled it into me and just cried continuing to hide my face in the pillow.

And though there has been some motherly transference she is not my mother. \n\nWhile I lay there she continued to rub my back and at one point I think she laid her head on my back shoulder area for a minute.

    "selftext": "This is my first time posting on any forum as a whole, so sorry if I do this wrong lol. \n\nSo long story short, my friend showed me a picture of her T the other day and I decided to do the same (this is probably boundary crossing so that’s on me). I tried googling her so her business page would pop up because I don’t know the URL. A picture popped up of her at a rally of some sort for a Republican politician a while back and it made me uncomfortable. I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt because although I am very liberal, I try to know other people’s views because I know they’re not all bad. I googled this politician and his views weren’t the WORST but they weren’t in line with mine at all. He supported the overturning of Roe V. Wade and did not support LGBTQ+ rights.\n\nI am a bisexual woman and I have cried to my therapist multiple times about how angry I am about things like Roe v. Wade being overturned and other political issues and now that I know she supports/supported someone like that, I feel silly???? Like I ranted and cried to someone who was probably happy about some of the things I’ve talked about. She’s always been super professional, so I never had any idea that she potentially believed these things, but now that I know this, I feel super uncomfortable. \n\nI’ve been wanting to switch therapists for a while now and this was just the icing on the cake, but I don’t know how to go about it. I’ve been seeing her for years and I am unsure how to go about “breaking up” with my T. She was very helpful in my time of need and now I am on a “as needed” basis to see her, but I feel like she hasn’t been helpful in a while and I more so just figure it out on my own. I’m wanting to see a T because I am struggling with things like imposter syndrome and empathy burn out ((I’m in school to become a T myself)) but do I need to tell my current T that I am seeking a new one? Or can I just essentially “ghost” her?",

    "selftext": "I posted last week about my T sharing some negative counter-transference, and added later how it made me spiral into SI.\n\nWell, not only am I safe, but I've had two subsequent sessions with my T and we hammered out this rupture and things are a thousand times better in therapy, and in my life right now. When I told her that her negative perception of me led to a lot of shame, she explained her rationale for sharing the info with me. She said that she kept thinking how one of my therapy goals was to feel more \"real\" and less empty and disconnected from others. So she decided to model what \"being real\" in relation to other people looked like i.e. honestly sharing all your thoughts and feelings, even the horrible ones. Even the ones that might get us rejected or make other people angry (she admitted a fear I would terminate but decided to risk it anyway). She wanted to break through my inability to be authentic and honest with her, so she became brutally honest with me to demonstrate how to do it, and to take risks in relationships. And to demonstrate that you can find aspects of communicating with a person frustrating but still really like them and want to spend time with them (which she said was her feeling with me).\n\nAll I can say is that this was a lightbulb moment for me. I suddenly felt like somebody cared enough about me to do something completely radical to try and help me. And somebody was finally honest and truthful with me, not twisting their meaning or my perception (like my ex-husband did). When I realised this, I felt so much closer to her. And now I have experienced honesty and transparency in a relationship, I can do the same towards her. \n\nso TL:DR Always, always talk through a rupture. Always ask *why* your T did or said something that hurt you. A good T will give you answers that can change the entire therapy for the better.",

I had a particularly bad session today where I opened up about SI and I spent the whole session crying. I can’t stop looking at the clock during sessions like this and it makes things worse because I know we’re going to have to wrap things up after 50 minutes and it reiterates that I’m so fucking alone and the only person I have I am paying him to be nice to me. Which turns it into a cyclical crying session lol.  Hearing him say we’ve got two minutes left while I’m sobbing just makes me feel so shit, even though I know he’s doing it to give me warning so I can prepare myself. It feels like a knife when he ends the zoom session while I’m hysterically crying. I wish I had someone like my therapist irl which I know would and could never happen. I’m sorry for the sob fest. I’m so pathetic rn. I swear I’m not this bad in my day-to-day life.\n\nEdit: I think I’m spiralling but we were discussing protective factors in the session and I was saying that most people wouldn’t notice if I was gone except maybe my mum and my T asked what I thought she would do if I did commit suicide. I said to be honest I think she’d maybe end her life but she’s already so depressed she can’t work or leave her bed so... My T then asked why do you think it’s okay for your mother to end her life because of you? I know he was just trying to understand but I already feel like a terrible person and that really made me feel worse.",

    "selftext": "Preface: Diagnosed ADHD. My therapist specializes in DBT and also has ADHD but does not medicate\n\nTitle pretty much sums it up. In my therapy session the other day I was mentioning to my therapist about the struggles and set backs I have been facing with finding a Dr who prescribes Adderall.     \n\nFor background, I have diagnosed ADHD. I have suffered with debilitating depression and anxiety my whole life apart from about 5 years ago. I have made huge leaps and bounds with therapy and along that journey my previous psychiatrist noticed a pattern. That my inability to focus negatively effected many aspects of my life which I’m turn brought upon my anxiety and depression. She then prescribed me Adderall (about 3 years ago)\n\nSince being prescribed my life has completely turned around. Being able to self motivate and get things done has made massive changes to my life. I was able to move, create an independent life for myself… I even own my own business!   \n\nHaving moved the past year I have been having trouble getting Adderall prescribed to me. About 90% of the doctors I contact don’t even prescribe it one doc has told me. I currently live in a big college town where I’m sure misuse runs rampant so I think it comes with the territory. \n\nI had mentioned this to my therapist yesterday and she went on to ask ,\n\n“Do you think YOU are completing the tasks when on Adderall or do you think the pills are doing it for you?” \n\nI told her I think it was a combination of both me and the medication. She went on to tell me that I need to know how to function without it (which I think is fair if I can’t get a prescription). She said it takes willpower and mindfulness. To be able to notice when you’re getting off track and then focus back in on the task at hand. And then told me Adderall is “literally meth” (I know it isn’t literally meth this is just factually wrong. Both amphetamines but not the same) and how she painted her whole house in a day without sleeping while on Adderall. I told her I have never done that and it has never effected me that way\n\nShe then went on to tell me how a neuroscientist (or a title similar) was able to cure her own (the neuroscientists) schizophrenia through changing her mindset. She told me she was able to do it through not engaging or reacting to the hallucinations therefore not giving them power….\n\nShe then recommended a bunch of “Managing your ADHD” workbooks (made by actual psychiatrists so I give her that)\n\nIdk what to think about any of this or if any of it it rings true…. A professionals opinion would be super helpful to me right now….Thank you so much for listening!!",

    "title": "Thank you T for not shaming me when I was being objectively creepy and wrote a story about you becoming my parent [Long post. I'm a writer who obviously doesn't understand brevity]",
    "selftext": "TLDR: I wrote and finished a 90,000+ word story about being kidnapped by my therapist, turned into a literal child and becoming his child. I'm grateful to my therapist for not shaming me when I first told him about the story. It saved my life, and set me up for the potential to become a really good writer one day.\n\nWhen I started therapy, I was going through a lot of abandonment trauma because I'm transgender and my mom was very unsupportive. I also (trans-male) never had a male role model, so I had avoided male therapists prior to him.\n\nMonths later, after I finally let my guard down and let him support me, I found this space where for the first time in my life, I felt really safe. It often made me feel like a little kid, and it was such a strange feeling that I didn't understand. I looked it up and learned about paternal transference, and for so long, I went through a lot of shame about it.\n\nIt was pretty bad for a long time. I remember constantly lamenting about how he probably wasn't even completely old enough to *really* be my father (He just *barely* is). Still, there were so many coincidences that made everything so much worse. He is from the same Caribbean island as my mom, and we have a whole lot of things in common. It's rare to meet other Caribbean people who are also atheists, and he was actually super LGBT-affirming. I think one of the most important moments in my life was when I asked him, maybe six months to a year after the start of therapy if he would accept his child if they came out as transgender. I'll never forget how he told me with such great conviction, \"I would never abandon my child.\"\n\nI think it was right after that, when I started thinking about what my life would have been like if I had a parent like him. I mean, I had always thought about it, but I now had someone I felt like I really knew and could picture taking that role. It probably wasn't too long after that when I had such a realistic and vivid dream about exactly that happening. I didn't know how to feel about it the morning afterwards. I didn't know how to process it, and I certainly wasn't going to tell him about it. Then, the following night I had another similar dream where I felt safe, secure and supported, and I kept wanting to go back to it. I wanted to explore that world that my subconscious had created.\n\nI finally downloaded an app onto my phone that I could password-protect some text, and I wrote about my dream. Within a day, I had written 6,000 words. The next day, I wrote 8,000 and it kept going. Pretty soon, I had a 28,000 word story that I had big plans for written on my phone. I started to tell my close friends about it, and they were understanding. I changed the names of the characters (but they are ridiculously close to the real deal), and I started posting it to story sites.\n\nIt hit off on wattpad, where I now have over 170,000 reads, two days before I finish the story. At the time, I had like 10,000 and I was getting nervous about my therapist finding it without telling him about it. The fear paralyzed me because I would tell myself that it was okay as long as he didn't know. One day, while walking through the door, I told him I wrote a story, but I couldn't share it with him.\n\nThe next session, he followed up on that, and I told him how happy I was with the story and how it was doing, but that I couldn't tell him about it. I told him that I did something regretful, and I truly believed it would hurt our therapeutic alliance. We basically played cat and mouse about it for another 3-5 sessions, until I finally told him. I felt so ashamed because the wife in the story was actually built based on his actual wife who was the other therapist in his private practice (something it didn't take me too long to figure out). I sent him a link to the story, and while it stressed me out, I was so grateful to finally stop feeling so guilty and ashamed.\n\nThe next session we talked about how I didn't use his real name or identifying information and that fantasy often starts in reality. He pointed out that I was shaming myself over something that really wasn't that bad. He talked about how he really felt like writing that story was a really important part of my therapeutic journey. He told me that he actually went and read the first three chapters, and that he thought it was really good, and that I had so much potential as a writer. The parallel to my own parent was so noticeable as I had sent my mother (who's a painter and English teacher) my chapters weeks ago, and she didn’t read them (she still hasn't two years later).\n\nI wrote my acknowledgements for the story, and it will be posted in around 48 hours from now. I'm actually going to see my therapist five hours before it goes up, and I'm excited to share it with him, since he does get the longest acknowledgement. I'll share it here with you all too.\n\n*To my therapist, who didn’t shame me when I finally confessed to using your personality and the sum of our interactions as a basis for Simon and his relationship with Jacob, I owe you a debt of gratitude for the positive direction that my life has taken in the last two years. Months before I started this story at twenty-two, I was as hopelessly depressed as Jacob, and I have no doubt that our therapeutic relationship saved my life. You gave me the space to be a blocked writer during depressive episodes and an excited chatterbox when inspiration struck in the midst of hypomania. Your support enabled me to explore an unfiltered fantasy and create a world where I felt just as safe and supported as I did at each and every session.*\n\nMy life could have gone so completely differently had he been like my therapist before him, shaming and judgmental. Because of this story, I will probably go on to pursue writing as my lifelong hobby, and maybe even become a bestselling author one day. His grace was the greatest gift that he gave me the day I told him about my story.\n\nThank you T.",

He was actually the one who brought it up in the first place and at the time I didn’t feel I did have a crush but it developed in the following weeks. He has always said he doesn’t feel uncomfortable about it. We sometimes joke about it and it’s very much not a “taboo” subject. \n\nSome examples of how it’s been discussed:\n- He asked how it felt knowing that he didn’t see me in a sexual way and even if he did, he wouldn’t act on it. I responded jokingly saying I felt “challenged” and he laughed.\n- He asked me to think carefully about how I’d feel if he made a move right now and we were to actually have sex. I sort of grimaced in response and he laughed and was like “see! I think you’d rather I just remained a friend or father figure to you.” \n- He said that he’d probably disappoint me outside of therapy and joked that if I spoke to his wife she’d help me see him in a less flattering light. \n\nSo we’ve always been open about it and I feel like when he asks me to consider the realities of what I’m wishing for, it does help me. We talk about my history and experiences outside of therapy and usually together we rationalise that I probably don’t really want to have sex with him but it’s more likely transference because of x experience and work through what this means for me and the way I operate in the world etc etc. \n\nIt all came to a head about a month ago because I tried to terminate therapy. I told him I was worried about feeling too attached and I felt my response to therapy wasn’t healthy. He encouraged me to talk it through with him. He asked if me wanting to have sex with him was a trauma response or if I really wanted to have sex with him and I said that I wasn’t sure but most likely both. We talked about how he would never cross that line, it has never and would never happen with a client, etc. I felt weirdly safe after that conversation almost like I knew where I stood and healthy boundaries had been implemented. T didn’t seem fazed and I thought everything was okay.\n\nThe next session I had, he told me he’d gone away and realised how deeply uncomfortable I’d made him feel and that boundaries had been crossed. He also said my behaviour was not acceptable. I was so ashamed and embarrassed I just shut down. He said he was happy to keep working with me but that we needed to “cut the shit and do some actual therapy”. Since then I’ve avoided mentioning anything to do with our therapeutic relationship. I do actually think I’ve made good progress in this time but I also feel quite awkward and as though I can’t be myself or talk about certain things. For example, one week T had to cancel our appointment and the following session he asked how I’d coped without therapy that week. I felt like I had to lie and say it was totally fine when in fact I’d really struggled. I felt if I was honest he would think I was too attached and it would make him uncomfortable again. \n\nI guess I just don’t know where the line is and how to balance my behaviour between being overly attached or sexual and being open and honest. I’m afraid to ask what I can and can’t do/say in case my T things I’m harping on about it or I sound like a sex pest who can’t control themself. If I’m being totally honest, I also don’t understand why he felt I was inappropriate when he’d never had an issue with it before - it felt very sudden. I really don’t think that I said anything that I hadn’t before - the only thing I can think of is the fact that I said I wasn’t sure if I actually wanted to have sex with him or if it was transference whereas usually I’ll concede that I don’t really want to have sex with him. Maybe he’d just had enough and felt we’d talked about it too many times? \n\nI guess I’m just confused and ashamed to the point where I don’t know how to move past it. I feel as though he hates me now and I’ve completely messed up our therapeutic relationship. Has anyone had anything similar and worked through it? \n\nI’m sorry this post is so long! I’m also sorry that I sound like a crazy obsessive person. I just feel a lot of shame around the whole thing and want to talk to people who understand.\n\nEDIT: Thank you to everyone who responded. I actually love this community. I feel really supported rn. Thank you.\nI will say that I'm a bit worried  I've made things sound far worse than they are. I can see how it looks but I think all the comments he said were to serve a purpose beneficial for me - such as helping me to think through my impulsive behaviour and the implications of what I was asking for. I do feel a bit funny because I  genuinely think my therapist is great at what he does. What will happen if my T sees this post?",

I said money was kind of something, especially because my gas has gone up from 30 for a tank to 50. He was like “oh yeah thank joe Biden for that”. And I responded that I wasn’t going to thank him for anything. He was like “oh yeah you’re on that side” then proceeded to put his hand over his mouth and went “go joe Biden” (mocking me at this point). I responded with “I don’t know I’m not on either side.” And he kept going with “it doesn’t matter which side you’re on, it’s joe Biden’s fault for our cost of living going up.”\n\nAt this point it was kind of tense and I just looked at him and said “okay.” He finally moved on but it just really rubbed me the wrong way. I think therapy should be a safe place without people getting attacked, especially by the person leading the group. I was very passive because I wasn’t about to fight about something I didn’t have any interest in. But even if I did support Biden, it’s a terrible message he’s sending that people can’t express what they believe in. He does this a lot in our groups, he brings up politics all the time. And at this point idk how to respond when he does it. I find it embarrassing on his part. So I would like advice on how to possibly respond or deal with this in the future.",

    "selftext": "I've had a wonderful experience with my T so far, but today, I shared some pretty sensitive stuff with her and her reaction was very disappointing and triggering for me.\n\nFor some context, I have seen her for about 20 sessions, and so far we have covered issues like self-esteem lack and expressing needs, family history behind all that, but only today did I mention my encounters with being sexually harrassed. And I was really surprised by her reaction.\n\nWhen I told her about a time I was sexually harrassed in front of 3 friends/acquaintances and despite my requests for the harrassment to stop, the person doing it did not stop and my friends were on his side, my T said \"and what could you have done to stop that?\"\n\nWhen I told her about a time I was making out with a guy at a festival, and then changed my mind about sleeping with him (not that it had been established we would do that), and he got angry and told me I \"at least owe him a blow job\" she said \"well, you had started taking part in sexual activity. It could have been a bit misleading to him.\"\n\nI don't know, she has been great so far, and maybe this is just triggering to me and I'm blowing it out of proportion. But right now, I don't feel safe going back to her. She also spent almost the entire session arguing with me on wether systemic sexism exists or not. Previously in sessions, she has never been hung up on trying to get me to see that my pov is wrong, nor has she appeared frustrated, but she did today. It seems there is a good possibility that this particular issue has touched a nerve with her, that there may be some countertransference. While I am sympathetic, idk if I am strong enough to acknowledge this and continue to work with her.\n\nWhat would you guys do? 😰\n\nEDIT: Thank you all for your responses! So many supportive and great and helpful comments, it really helps to know I am not alone in this. ❤\nI am still trying to figure out what to do, but you guys helped a lot. Thank you.\n\nEDIT 2: I ended up writing her a (brief) email, in which I mentioned that I did not feel safe with her in the last session, am now sure that I need to work with a more trauma-informed and woke therapist, but would still like a last session to tie up our whole process. I called all the \"woke\" therapists I knew of (2 I found online identifying as feminist therapists, and one is the T of an acquaintance who for that reason cannot work with me), and got a buncha referrals, called them all, and guess what you guys, I am meeting with my new T in August 😊❤  Thanks again to all of you for the support, you got me through a pretty dark hour.",

    "title": "Maternal transference has made me a better mom",
    "selftext": " \n\nI’ve been meaning to write this post for a while, so here goes:\n\nLike many here I have been through the whole gamut of emotions when it comes to wishing my therapist was my mom, and being deeply ashamed about it. Without going into my whole life story, I just… have a bad track record with moms. Lots of rejection there. I’ve had this frustrating push-pull behavior towards maternal figures all my life, but I never was able to talk about it until recently.\n\nI now realize that what I needed from my mom was unconditional acceptance. Being able to hold all my emotions without taking them personally. Teaching me how to calm down. Allowing me to be a child and make mistakes. Not dismissing my experience because I am a child. Taking genuine interest in all my good and bad parts. Not punishing me for being protective of myself. My therapist models those things, and it has been a corrective experience for me. I hope this won’t be taken the wrong way: I truly think the closest equivalent to the therapist-client relationship, at least emotionally, is the parent-child relationship. A parent provides a stable, consistent, unconditional positive regard, a safe place for a child to explore who they are. And a child should never have to worry about taking care of a parent’s feelings, or winning their parent’s approval, or begging for their parent’s acceptance.\n\nAll this coincided with the birth of my son and I guess before therapy I never really thought about what kind of parent I wanted to be, but I knew I didn’t want to be like my mom. My therapist talked about proactive steps I could take to bond with my baby, which helped so much. But I honestly think her just being there and being herself has taught me so much. \n\nMy therapist’s voice has been slowly replacing my mom’s voice. My mom’s is cold and critical, but my therapist’s is so gentle, warm, compassionate, understanding, validating, safe. I try to imagine what she might say about things, and I can always count on that reaction from her. I know that even though the things I say to her may scare me, they don’t scare her. \n\nI just hope that my son doesn’t have to see a therapist to experience that. I don’t mean that I don’t want him to go to therapy. I just hope that when he goes through difficult times, that the voice he draws on for strength would be mine, and the person he imagines holding him would be me. I hope that he would never be afraid to tell me something because of my reaction, that he would know it wouldn’t change how I feel about him, because I see him as fundamentally good, and I make the choice to see him through that lens every day. I hope he knows that I think he’s fantastic, even when he’s screaming and crying and pooping all over me. :)\n\nI know this all sounds very idealistic, and realistically I’m going to make mistakes as a mom. But I hope if he ever goes to therapy and realizes what I’ve done wrong and tells me about it, that I wouldn’t be too proud to apologize and try to make it right. Because I know that is what my therapist would do for me. Maternal transference has been really painful. For a long time I thought it was a bad thing, a feeling I needed to overcome in order to be a healthy person. But maybe it’s not. Maybe it’s okay to see my therapist as my replacement mom, to let the little-kid in me idolize her and want to be just like her. Maybe it’s helping me break a cycle, maybe I am experiencing maternal transference so that my son won’t have to.",

She was as warm and kind as always. Therapy is such a mind fuck.\n\nEdit: For those thinking this sounds like BPD... the only person in the entire world this scenario plays out with is my therapist. In real life I’m the most loving, caring, empathetic, sweet, complete PUSHOVER. I’ve seriously never said a mean thing to anyone basically ever. She knows this :( We have been together for 3 years and for 2.5 years I was my normal loving self. Then BAM I became horribly attached, and after having lost a previous close therapist, I know how... how quickly everything can change. She was young and decided to stop practicing therapy and stay home with her toddler. You’re absolutely spot on that I’m terrified of getting hurt, and I’m trying to push her away. But I imagine for it to be BPD it would need to play out with other people in my life.",

One of my complaints was how I’ve spent years with her and don’t even know basic things about her and she said while that’s true... in many ways her clients know her better than people in her personal life do. She also asked me what it would be helpful for me to know about her. I said I wanted to talk about that another day. She said many of my complaints about the therapeutic relationship are valid.

Things got progressively weird.\nEver since the first session he had told me I was a very interesting woman and later on he said I exerted sensuality and grace. I thought this was ok, because he is supposed to lift me up, so I didn't think too much about it.\nThen, on the 6th session he asked if he could hug me and I allowed it. It actually felt good because it was a very emotional session.\nAfter this, he was greeting me with a kiss and saying goodbye with a hug. Then his hands started lingering and pressing my back. When the last session was over, he repeated this behavior but he then gazed into my eyes and I am pretty sure he wanted to kiss me. Instead, he smelled my neck and kissed me longer then usual on my cheek. He also didn't want to let go of his embrace, even though I was pulling back. \nNow, I also have feelings for him, which I see as only natural, because who wouldn't have feelings for someone who is that available and attentive? But I do know it's wrong to act on those emotions. I wasn't expecting that he would do this, though.\nI don't know whether I should confront him and ask him about it  or stop going to therapy altogether. \n\nTldr: I think my therapist wants to get physical and this is very confusing to me\n\n** EDIT: I decided to leave and cut all contact. I had to discuss this with my bf because 1s I feel he deserves to know 2nd because I don't want to lie and be changing therapists without him knowing. He was quite supportive and sweet.\nI am, however, afraid of what my therapist will do now. From what I understand he won't just let this go. And he has my data, he knows where I live, etc...\n\n*** EDIT: I can't answer you individually bc my account is new. But I'm thankful you made me understand what the right thing to do is. In other circumstances I would report him, but this is far more complex than just that. I have no hard evidence, just my word against his. Moreover, in my country we don't have a strong legal defense when it comes to this kind of issues. I never heard of any mental health professional being held accountable for malpractice. Let alone something related to sexual misconduct, which is taboo. Risking going in to a legal battle can actually turn on me. I feel bad for other girls that may go through the same, but I don't feel I'm mentally or legally strong right now.",

I would like to get your opinions on something.  \nI had a therapist who, after 4 sessions, announced she was closing up her in person shop (where she provided equine-assisted therapy) to do fully telehealth.

I decided I wanted to see another therapist at the same stable. The original therapist told me I couldn’t see the new therapist until she (the old therapist) switched fully to telehealth because of a non-compete they share, and its important for me to \"end well\" and not activate abandonment issues. I said I was glad she identified the abandonment stuff, and I offered to do one more termination session with the old therapist, and asked if I could see the new therapist after that. The old therapist said yes, she would do a termination session, but no, I couldn’t see the new therapist until she switched fully to telehealth in a month. I said I thought that was quite rigid and I wished we could’ve compromised.

I tried to be polite, but also express myself, basically.

Here's what I found:\n\n* 5 of them do NOT actually offer in-person appointments according to their websites.\n* 7 of them are NOT actually located in LA (San Bernadino, San Diego, one was even in ARIZONA).\n* 8 of them are not taking new patients.\n* 4 of them don't even treat depression (alcohol/substance abuse only, sex therapists, one guy literally listed \"BDSM, kink, queer, ethical non-monogamy\" as his areas of focus).\n\nSo that leaves **16** male therapists on the site who offer in-person therapy for depressed people in the city of Los Angeles.\n\nI did the same search on other sites and the results were even worse:\n\n* APA Psychology Locator: 5\n* Mental Health Match: 4\n* Zencare: 11\n* Good Therapy: 2\n\nI've phoned many therapists in my area just through Google Map searches. Most of them are either virtual-only, not accepting new patients, or didn't call me back. One therapist cancelled 30 minutes before the appointment saying his dog was sick, and never followed up with me. Another insisted I wear a mask, which whatever ok, but then phoned me the next day saying he actually \"wasn't comfortable\" with seeing me in-person.\n\nI just hate that this is how it is now. I hate that we're just supposed to accept it. Many of us are isolated and suffering, and these people would rather just sit at home.",

For the entire session, She had us consider “both sides” (keeping the baby vs not), but we didn’t really talk about the abortion aspect of it. She mostly just asked me to think about what it would be like to have another baby and tried to get me to view it in a positive light. It felt so off to me. I wasn’t expecting it. She suggested that trauma from my first childbirth might be the reason I don’t want another one. She kind of made me feel bad for not wanting a sibling for my daughter. I don’t know. The whole situation just didn’t sit right with me. It wasn’t like she was telling me directly to not have an abortion, but she was definitely indirectly doing so. Bringing up my grandparents and parents and how they would be excited. It felt like all the reasons she came up with for why I should have the baby were all benefitting someone else. I’m the one going through child birth, shouldn’t I make the decision that’s best for me and my body, and not the people around me? I am thinking about not seeing her anymore but I don’t know how to tell her without it being awkward. And I no showed on an appointment today because I was so anxious about it. After that appointment, I was distraught and depressed for a few days thinking I was letting everyone in my life down. I’ve realized now I’m doing what’s best for me but now I have to deal with this. I was just in a fragile mental state and I felt like I was manipulated in some way? I don’t know if i’m overreacting. \n\n* I understand that not everyone supports abortion and that is fine. I’m just looking for support. Is this normal for a therapist to do/say? How do I stop seeing her without it being awkward?",

I was tempted to work it out. To keep talking to this guy because I don't have any other therapist lined up. But I talked with my husband, my mom, my siblings, my dad- they all said to dump him and run. I was scared of this phone call.\n\nHe called today for a phone session he started his usual greeting, kind of asking how I felt since I last saw him, and his tone showed he knew I wasn't having a good time and wanted to unpack that. We've had more sessions lately because I have a holiday from work- 2x week sessions for last 2 weeks. This was the first phone session since that because I have to go back to work. I was so tempted to let it slide/talk it out, worried I was wrong, but I stuck to my guns.\n\nI told him that the panic attack I had in his parking lot was the closest I've been to a mental hospital since I was in high school. That my OCD has fixated on a certain thing because he told me to panic about it. How we don't set goals and in the last 7 years that I've gone to him for therapy (a few years were like a few session a year, but the last 2 have been weekly) we've made little progress, that we had no real goals. That it feels like we've taken two steps back. I told him I no longer wanted to receive services from him and asked him to never contact me again. To his credit, he seemed like he wanted to apologize and help me process, but I know it would just be the same rehashed stuff. When I finished talking, he said \"ok, I understand, I hope you get the help you need.\" (Edit- I was very keyed up, so he might have said he hoped I find the help I'm looking for, but same difference, I guess).\n\nI said ok and hung up. I was trembling and my voice wavered the whole time but I didn't break down until I hung up. I asked my husband to listen to me talk on the phone for support. As soon as I hung up, he wrapped me in his arms and told me I did everything right as I shook and cried. I'm scared of not having a therapist for now (I'm on a waiting list for someone who specializes in OCD treatment) but it's better than paying for this. I'm proud I stuck to my decision and was able to express it. I'm not assertive and this was very hard. I'm so lucky I have my husband and the rest of my family to support me through this. Here's to hanging in there until I can be helped the way I deserve to be helped.",

Out of all the problems I’m experiencing, it ranks very low in my mind. If anything, my relationship with my wife is one of the few aspects of my life that helps with my feelings. \n\nAs the session went on, he kept asking me very personal questions about our sex life. He asked me what we do to spice things up. My wife and I will sometime engage in role play to this end. I explained this to him thinking he’d be satisfied, but he kept asking me more questions about it. At one point he asked me specifically what the nature of the roleplay was. He describe it as “very important” that I explain to him what we roleplay during sex. After I explained it to him, with a creepy smile he says “that’s great, I love that.” I instantly got this very off putting vibe that he was getting off to me explaining my sex life in detail to him. \n\nKeep in mind this was our *first* session together. \n\nAm I wrong to feel weird about this?

    "selftext": "When things are a little harder or I'm lonely, I miss my therapist. She radiates this safety and care that I have trouble finding on my own, especially if I'm having trouble with my PTSD symptoms or anxiety. Right now, I'm about a week away from a trauma anniversary, and I'm already not doing so hot, so here I am yearning for my therapy session 4 days away.\n\nA while ago, I was trembling almost incessantly after getting triggered pretty badly. I couldn't stop shaking for about two days, until I had therapy. At some point during the session, I just stopped shaking without realizing it, because my subconscious has realized that she's a safe person and didn't need to be so on edge. It was so much relief. After I finished up my workday (I have my sessions on my lunch break) I curled up under a giant blanket and fell asleep, exhausted and finally able to relax. As I was falling asleep, it felt like she was in the room -- not in a creepy way, but like I could feel her presence nearby, watching over me and making sure I was safe. It was the most peaceful sleep I'd had in so long. I didn't read this until later, but *The Body Keeps the Score* said, \"Frightened adults respond to the same comforts as terrified children: gentle holding and rocking and the assurance that somebody bigger and stronger is taking care of things, so you can safely go to sleep.\" (Van der Kolk is referring specifically to being physically embraced, but I think the concept applies.)\n\nThere's other things about her that just feel so safe. She has such a level energy -- like she hasn't been fazed by anything I've said yet. She's so warm. There are times when I'm acting skittish and she softens her voice and looks at me with compassion. She laughs at my stupid jokes but also gently calls me out if I'm using them to be (too) avoidant. She's helped me with so much already. I know that she's doing her best to look out for me, and that hits me so hard -- I've had to deal with my issues alone and pretend they don't exist, especially around people that are supposed to care about me, so having someone help me deal with things feels like a lot.\n\nI know this sounds like a lot of yearning. I don't have any delusions about what our relationship is or could be, I just really wish I had that feeling of safety right now! But I will put on my \"functional adult\" pants and go meditate or whatever. I want to express to her exactly how safe she makes me feel (I've expressed it in general, but not \"I felt like you were watching over me and it helped me sleep\") and how I miss her when I'm having trouble (probably because I wish she would save me), but I feel weird about it.\n\nThis was kind of a ramble.

I never contact my therapist out of sessions, but this week I emailed her to ask if we could schedule a sooner session. She replied asking why I need it. I didn’t know what to say in the email and felt slightly better and bad for bothering her, so I replied we could talk about it in my normal session. \n\nMy normal session came round and she said she was frustrated with me. She said I shut her down and I’m hard to communicate with. She asked whether this is how I talk with family etc and when I said no, she asked why she gets special treatment. \n\nShe said I could ‘unfrustrate’ her by explaining myself, which I struggled to do. There was no major reason I had needed the extra session except I felt bad and really wanted to talk to her. \n\nI guess her reaction came from concern but I am so shocked and hurt by her reaction. The last thing I wanted was to frustrate her and all I wanted was to respect her boundaries, but it feels like I respected them too much.",

Towards the end she just kind of looked at me and said that she really missed me and wished I was there in person so she could give me a big hug (we do virtual therapy). As she said that she started tearing up and sniffing for a few minutes and I saw her wipe her eyes.\n\nI know some people would consider this inappropriate, but it felt like the most natural thing in the world to me. She is not at all the type to get emotional. I've only ever seen her get misty-eyed a few times and even then I was never sure if I saw it right because she kept the focus entirely on me. Yesterday was no exception regarding the latter, but I think it was the most overtly emotional I've ever seen her and it just... it feels amazing and terrifying and makes me want to cry all at once.\n\nI never thought I could come to mean that much to someone just by talking about my thoughts and my life and my problems. Yet I clearly matter to her in a very personal way despite it not being a reciprocal relationship in terms of support/disclosure etc. I really find it anxiety-provoking to matter to someone like that and feel like I've done nothing to deserve it.

It's a delicate balance and not many people have fit the brief exactly. She has so far been the definition of this. \n\nOver the past few sessions I've noticed her giving me words of encouragement. That I'm doing good work, she's proud of my progress. Each time I've felt that little codependent hit of \"ooooooh, praise and affirmation\" but so far it has been brief. When we signed off today (after a particularly intense season focusing on childhood trauma) she said something along the lines of \"I just want you to know that you're a wonderful client to work with.\" We then both said have a happy Thanksgiving and closed the window (we're still virtual).

I had a lot going on in the previous week, and as I was thinking of my next point to bring up, I hear a clicking sound from my therapists end of the video call. \n\nIt wasn’t computer typing, and I’ve seen him type before so I know what the computer typing sounds like. The clicking sounded more concentrated, like someone was typing on a blackberry or something like that. For a brief moment, it was silent, and he was still looking down into his hands. He moved his hands upwards, and I saw the tail end of what I perceived to be a Nintendo switch? \n\nI didn’t say anything about it, but I mentally clocked out of the session at that point. I tried to fill the silence and connect ideas to keep him engaged but then I realized that I shouldn’t have to be the one to do that. \n\nI’m not sure what to do. I feel betrayed and hurt. Should I report him to the state board, or just find a different therapist? \n\nThx for reading. \n\nEDIT: Also, our client/ provider relationship is more “easy going”. He was comfortable enough to tell me how therapy wasn’t his main job, which isn’t an issue. But it makes me wonder if that’s another layer as to why he was so checked out during the session. ",

Their office persona can be vastly different from their home life. I still struggle with jealousy, but this really helped me shift my perspective.",

I didn’t really want to do it. I didn’t tell her I was unsure, I just said okay, because for once in 5 years SHE suggested something. I did say “I don’t really like tea that much” and she said “I don’t either, that’s why I’m excited to do it! I want to see if there are some that I like!”\n\nI found a 48 tea sampler set online and I ordered it for each of us (I have enough free spending money to do that) and I suggested that instead of one day of a tea tasting, we try a new one each week. She loved the idea.\n\nLast week we tried our first tea- Honey Vanilla Chamomile and I absolutely LOVED trying it with her much more than I thought I would. She wanted to take notes on the teas so I got a cute little notebook and a cute gel pen and she wrote that it smelled like a country store.\n\nI just wanted to share how adorable she is and how surprisingly fun it ended up being!

She's validated me, seen me at my worst, watched me cry, laughed with me, mentored me, gently chastised me and has shared in both my ugliest and most joyful moments. The most important thing she's given me is her infinite patience and compassion. No matter what feelings I've had or how many times we've had to (and still have to) discuss the same stuff, she still greets everything I say with such loving kindness. I feel completely accepted. At first, I couldn't understand it because I've never had a relationship like that. It made me feel suspicious and defensive. It made me feel vulnerable. But now I'm okay with feeling vulnerable because it just means I'm here and I'm alive and I'm trying. I feel like being vulnerable is a strength because it helps you to accept a connection and heal. Being vulnerable means I can love more easily without reserve. I'm so greatful to my therapist for helping me to learn this and countless other things. I'm no where near there yet, but I'm trying my best to treat myself with the same compassion my therapist treats me with.\n\nI just feel so greatful. I love my therapist. Not in a romantic way, but in the way it's easy to love someone who is a good person. I'm greatful she exists. I'm thankful for her support. The world is a better place because she's in it.\n\nI'm far too embarrassed to say any of this in person but I wanted to write it down somewhere. I don't even know if it belongs here, but I wanted other therapists to know that you really make a difference to people like me. I think it's a really hard job, and from the bottom of my heart I appreciate therapists for listening to and empathising with so much trauma on a daily basis. I think working in mental health can be a thankless job here in the UK at times but the words of my therapist and kindness will stay with me forever, even if I'm just one more patient to her. I used to get hung up on how I can ever repay someone or thank someone for giving me something so important, but now I think the best gift I can probably give my therapist is to keep trying and go out there and live my best life.\n\nI'm due to qualify as a mental health nurse myself this year and I hope I can practice with as much warmth and sincerity as my therapist. \n\nSorry for the randomness and waffle of this thread.

For example, wouldn't the T prefer the patient stick around rather than get better so that they can keep taking their money? As people who understand psychology, wouldn't they also be uniquely equipped to exploit a person in this manner? Finally, the T can take advantage of the fact that therapy is a complex transaction in which the consumer is not well-equipped to assess the quality of the product, unlike buying a sandwich for instance. They can thus sell snake oil without the patient knowing or understanding. \n\nI can anticipate responses that talk about how therapists get into the profession for \"good reasons\", although I do not see how they would be different from people in any other profession. Furthermore, at least in the United States, the broader system is designed in a way to promote cutthroat rather than altruistic behavior, as people are struggling to survive due to lack of a social safety net. This incentivizes professionals across various fields to do anything for a buck, as shown by corporations who pollute the air and water. Also, who says the T will like any patient that comes their way - after getting to know them they might find them to be a repulsive human being and do things to even encourage their failure.\n\nWhile I appreciate feedback from anyone, I would particularly appreciate insider perspectives from therapists themselves.",

    "title": "Is this a terrible therapist I need to leave ASAP?!",
    "selftext": "I've been doing psychodynamic psychotherapy for about 18 months. I'm dealing with early childhood trauma (domestic violence, absent parents, divorce, emotional neglect) and abandonment issues. I'm in my 30s and this is my first therapy experience ever, which means I have nothing to compare it to.\n\nThe sessions have always been loose in terms of what I talk about with my therapist. It's been a mix of daily/work challenges and childhood memories. It has very slowly brought me some awareness of the level of abuse I've been through and how it shaped my life until now. Not easy to take in.\n\nBuilding therapeutic trust hasn't been easy either, I've been let down so many times from the people who should be the most reliable, it's hard to share my inner world with a stranger without always have it in mind they have the power to destroy it anytime they want to.\n\nDue to the virus, our sessions moved online. Fairly recently, in one of the sessions my therapist asked if I had missed the session/them during Easter break. To which I said no, it was Ok as that had been a break planned in advance and both of us knew it was going to happen. So having prepared myself mentally for that absence, I didn't \"miss it\" as I would if it was an unexpected break.\n\nAt hearing my answer, my therapist went ballistic and shouted aggressively  \"I'm fed up! I'm fed up with this!\" which was so unexpected I just froze in shock. We had been calmly talking until then, there was no indicator they were becoming upset (and I'm pretty good at reading voice tones and body language) so I was taken by absolute surprise.\n\nThat moment instantly took me back to my childhood where I would be shouted at out of nowhere for nothing at all - I'm talking screaming, big arm gestures and eventually violence - a slap, a kick or something of the kind.\n\nMy mind went blank, I couldn't make sense of what I was experiencing and instantly went into panic mode, I remember myself shaking inside with terror. Can't remember much after that.\n\nThe next few days I had anxiety attacks, dizziness, nausea, couldn't really function mentally as some of the days meant going from the bed to the sofa and just staring blankly at the walls. It was horrible and I was scared of how intense it was as I had never experienced something so intense for 3-4 days in a row. It also seriously affected my work as my capacity to think and react was severely diminished during those days.\n\nI waited for the next session to follow up and share what I had felt/been through. I was trying to make sense of my therapist's reaction. Maybe I should have said that I had missed the session? No, I should say what I feel. Maybe they were just having a bad day and we would clarify it in this session and all would be good again? Maybe this was a 'technique' they were trying on me to re-enact my trauma? And if so, with what purpose? I'm not looking to be retraumatized, quite the opposite!\n\nSo I went into the next session with all these questions in my head, and I shared all of them. I was met with defensiveness, dismissiveness, gaslighting and made to feel I had was the one who didn't have the capacity to carry an 'adult conversation' and that they had expectations I wasn't meeting. Then said, 'Now, I don't have any expectations from you anymore. It's like we're back to square one.' Saying I was profoundly dismayed is putting it lightly. Here I was trying to make sense of it and analyze it together and being told it was my fault with a patronizing tone to finish it. I thought therapy was supposed to be empowering not demeaning.\n\nMore anxiety attacks ensued, and mind my became obsessed with each following session, because this to me was an unresolved issue that my therapist was refusing to address. I felt deeply betrayed, and I told them. They replied they regretted I had felt the situation so intensely but on the other hand I was already expecting them to \"betray me at some point, so\". So?! It's hard to describe all the emotions I have felt since. This is BS.\n\nAll sessions since have revolved around this issue because to me it isn't resolved yet. I have also asked several times what the treatment plan is, what are we doing and with what goal thinking that maybe, maybe they have a bigger plan at play that will benefit me but I'm not buying into it. I feel worse, so much worse after therapy. And it's not the 'I need time to process my emotions' kind of worse, it's the 'Omg, I feel like I'm dealing with my family's abuse again and I can't take it, I can't'\n\nSomething feels wrong here. I will never forget that session, I feel it has regressed me on a lot of work I've done on myself over the years and I resent my therapist deeply for ever putting me in that situation. They're supposed to be an ally, not a predator! My days have been driven by fear, loneliness, forgetfulness and honestly, starting to lack hope.\n\nLast time we talked, I shared again how uncomfortable and betrayed I felt with that session. How patronising they sometimes sound when they say things like \"Yes, I don't expect you to understand\" when I'm exploring a subject. When I ask their feedback on what I'm sharing and they accuse me \"wanting to know things I don't need to\", they actually said \"it's like a child wanting to know what mummy and daddy are doing in the bedroom, and it's not for the child to know\". I mean. Then they spent the session saying \"so you're telling me I'm a sadistic therapist, who hides things from you, who likes to torture people, who enjoys to see your suffering'. Every time I asked something this would be the only answer I got - we went around in circles for 40min. I said if I was't learning anything about myself from therapy what was the point then? They said 'to play'. To what purpose, I asked? And they went 'Why would play need to have a purpose?' I told them I feel like an object it their hands, that they're playing with rather than adult who's working with a therapist to address issues.\n\nI feel sick just writing this.\n\nIs this therapist crazy, or am I missing something really obvious here? Is this normal??\n\nI have another session soon which I'm trying to decide if I'm going to miss or just use it to end the therapeutic relationship.\n\nHelp. Your thoughts are very welcome.",

I apologized for ending the session early, & said I felt disrespected by her response to my freezing up at her questioning since I made a point to warn her about how to deal with it early in our sessions and she kept badgering me with questions. I also explained this would be our last session. \n\nThe video kind of cut out, so I refreshed the window(not uncommon for me to do). It refreshed but her video was black & there was no sound. Then her video disappeared. That's never happened before. This was only 6 minutes into our session. \n\nI immediately emailed her and told her the video cut out and asked for a new link, but stayed in the session just in case. She didn't try to call or respond to email. I waited 10 minutes, then sent another email asking if she wanted to reschedule. No response. After another ten minutes, and officially half of my session was over, I ended the video chat, and sent another email asking if she intended to charge me, since she never returned or responded. That was 6 hours ago and she never responded. \n\nI'm pretty frustrated and I feel like this was her \"getting back at me\" for ending our session last time. I also don't think the way she brought up last week's session ending was professional. She didn't bring it up in a boundaries conversation or in a way meant to explore my reaction and reasoning behind it. She brought up that she felt disrespected then went silent, waiting for a response.\n\nWhat I expected out of the session was for her to give some guidance on what type of therapy she thought would be a good fit for me. I wanted to explore the ways our relationship snagged & based on this, develop questions to ask the next therapist so I could avoid wasting another 3 months in a therapy relationship going nowhere. I wanted to hear what she thought was the reason our sessions didn't really work out.\n\nI'm just curious if anyone else has had a therapist 'leave' mid session and/or missed out on a final session with a therapist.

    "selftext": "I've noticed my therapist sometimes gets distracted by social media while we are having virtual sessions. I let it slide because I thought it was a glitch. However, my brother died a few weeks ago and I've talked to my therapist about my brother and the grief. Last session, he tried to minimize my grief by saying \"You weren't really close with your brother\". I don't know how he got this idea but I was really angry after the session. I sent him this email:\n\n\"Hi xxxx,\n\nAfter our last session, I decided to terminate therapy because you tried to dismiss my grief by saying \"you weren't close with your brother\" which was not valid. I spoke about my brother before he died, and I don't know how you missed that. I've noticed that sometimes you are distracted during sessions and you are on social media. I believe that is why you missed a critical point - I was close with my brother.\n\nDue to you being distracted and not picking up on key information I cannot rely on you to provide me with the support I need at this time.\n\nIf you want to have a closure session next Monday, the 23rd. I can do that but not necessary.\n\nRegards,\"  \n\n\nUPDATE: He responded with a generic apology email that doe not admit he said anything wrong. Also, he denied being on social media or being distracted.  \nI know he was on social media because of the new Facebook feature that when you browse your feed it will automatically play a video. It happened to him during a therapy session. In addition, one time he had a cat in his lap. Also, he cuts sessions short frequently.  \nLast week he canceled a therapy session literally 5 minutes before it was scheduled.",

My husband is monitoring the content I put out, encouraging me to set my account to private and delete posts that are overtly sexual.\n\nHe also doesn’t like when I post photos of myself that *could be interpreted* as suggestive, and if I want to post a photo of him he refuses.

I wouldn’t want to do anything to harm his career or image, but I also feel some discomfort subjugating an important part of my identity.\n\nAny input would be appreciated.\n\n(I'm honestly dumbfounded that people are saying doing figure drawings/paintings is sex work. it's not, it's the most classical tradition in art, nor does it address my concern ..

It was the right decision but there are a lot of complex feelings there and once the initial adrenaline rush of leaving wore off I hit rock bottom on Thursday night and I have been crying on and off since then and I just feel terrible. My life is a mess, I'm living in the spare room in my parent's house with all my boxes around me. I'm super grateful to them for letting me stay for a bit but relationships there are super complex too, I have a really difficult relationship with my dad for multiple reasons and my mum has an eating disorder which I find triggering. My dad basically told me I need to pull myself together tonight which tbh was really unhelpful. I really hurt my back the other day and I am in a lot of pain. Being back in my home town is triggering AF for me and brings back all sorts of traumatic memories of my abusive relationship in my teens and of sexual assault and other childhood trauma. I just finished my masters degree and I am currently jobless. My brother is mad at me coz he thinks I have ruined his birthday as I didn't feel up to going out. My dog is miserable. Even though I know I made the right choice to leave my ex-partner, I miss him and I can't help but think that it would have just been easier if I stayed. Last night when I was driving I briefly considered just driving off a bridge to end all the pain and uncertainty.\n\nOn top of all of this, I messaged my T on Thursday night asking for an extra session next week (my T is cool with messaging outwith sessions and usually gets back to me ASAP) and she's not replied. I am not complaining about this and I completely accept she has a life outside of therapy and there are a million reasons why she may not have responded to me - so please don't come for me about that. I know that. I am not mad or annoyed at her. **However** I cannot help but think that if she replied to me then I might just feel slightly better. However, it was due to this that I had that realisation that I cannot be reliant on her, or anyone else, and I need to learn to take care of myself and get myself through.\n\nI know it will get better. I know life is full of ups and downs. But it just sucks and I wish I could fast forward to a time in my life when I feel better and things are more settled.

This is the second therapist I’ve told about the abuse and it is physically hard for me to verbalize it. None of this stuff was as simple as “being careful on the internet”. I was groomed, and my parents neglected me around this time. I just fell into the hands of a pedophile and that was that. It makes me feel truly disgusting that i should’ve just been “more careful”.

    "selftext": "Bold of me to assume people want to hear how things turned out after my previous post, but hopefully this will be helpful to somebody.\n\nI sent an email to my therapist explaining that I felt that they weren’t giving me the space I needed. We were discussing a difficult topic and my therapist kept prodding when I wasn’t ready or prepared for it (not their fault - at the time I seemed calm and cooperative), and I also said I have a very negative reaction whenever they show compassion for me (it increases my self-loathing because I feel I don’t deserve it.)\n\nI was very concerned about how my therapist would react because I perceived some parts of my email as passive aggressive and critical of them when that wasn’t my intention.\n\nThey replied saying my feelings are valid and we’ll discuss these topics in my next session. This was surprising to me because my therapist has never replied to an email that wasn’t about scheduling. This actually freaked me out because it made me feel like I had said something so horrible that a response was warranted.\n\nIn my session, they said therapists are always having to assess whether or not a client is wiling to explore a difficult topic, and sometimes mistakes are made. They offered to create a code word for me to say when I’m uncomfortable. They also said my email was good feedback for them and admitted that their first reaction when reading it was worrying they had messed up with me, which I really appreciated because it sounded like they genuinely care about the relationship.\n\nOverall, they emphasized that my email helped them understand me more deeply and that sending it made them feel closer to me because my honesty and vulnerability showed how much I trust them. I had been very anxious anticipating their reaction and entered the session bracing for a rupture, but instead the opposite happened. Wow!\n\nIf I hadn’t said anything I think I would have grown resentful, which is unfair to them because I shouldn’t expect my therapist to read my mind. It has also given us a lot of valuable material to work with. Soooo I don’t know who needs hear this, but tell your therapist if they’re doing something that isn’t working for you instead of keeping quiet. I think a good therapist will not take it personally and appreciate the opportunity to more accurately meet your needs.",

    "selftext": "And she was okay about it! I'd been putting it off for a few months because I was so embarrassed. But she said she loves talking about it and we reaffirmed the boundaries involved and she just made me feel ok and safe which was nice. And she said it was a good sign and is the hook that makes therapy work. So I am so relieved. Also we have done our entire therapy over video and we both want to do in person soon but have to wait until she's allowed to do in person (because of COVID). It was really nice. She said I would never know how she feels about me because she's not allowed to tell me and so it wasn't personal that nothing would happen. Somehow that makes me feel better that it's completely out of our hands and we can't do anything. Also we've been working a lot on me falling for unavailable women so hopefully this can be helpful.\n\nAnyway, I'm just so glad it's out in the open and nothing went sideways, no termination, no inappropriateness. I trust her so much!",

    "title": "My therapist raised her price after I mentioned that my parents were well-off",
    "selftext": "(not a native speaker, sorry for the grammar and spelling mistakes)  \n\n\nI've been seeing my therapist for a little more than 2 months now. It's my first time seeing a therapist and my parents are the one paying for it. In yesterday's session, I mentioned how expensive (like really expensive) my school was and that I felt guilty for failing my year. I told her (my therapist) that even though my parents make a lot of money (didn't mention how much), I still felt bad for wasting their money and that I hate myself for that because my parents are working hard for the money I'm wasting. At the end of the session, she told me that starting next week, the price would be +25% higher than usual. I have a one hour session each week.   \n\n\nI feel like I should mention this. I live in a shitty and corrupt third-world country. Corruption isn't limited to the government but the people too are often dishonest and corrupt. People tried to take advantage of my family because we are well-off in the past and it happened a lot of times. Like people we would hire to do a job and then would charge us like twice or thrice the market price once they witness what kind of car my dad drive or how big our house is. I know that I sound like a greedy spoiled prick but believe me when I say  that most of the people in my country are dishonest when it comes to making money.   \n\n\nAs part of my therapy, I have to frequently write my thoughts (especially the negative ones) and what am feeling in a notebook and today I wrote something like : \"I think that it's odd that my therapist would suddenly decide to increase her prices right after I mentioned that my parents are well-off. I don't know if she's acting genuinely and it's just a coincidence that she would raise her price or if she's just trying to take advantage of me now that she know that my family have money\".   \n\n\nI feel like the whole point of a therapy and for it to be effective is to be honest and tell the truth about what I'm feeling and thinking. I've always used therapy as a mean to get everything off my chest but I often forget that my therapist is a human being as well and that she could get hurt by what I'm saying. I feel like I've been rude to her in the past by being brutally honest about what I was thinking about the therapy or how it was done. I feel like it would be rude, insensitive and disrespectful if I told her that I think that she might be dishonest and that she's trying to steal from me. I'd probably erase what I wrote in my notebook regarding that but I'm still doubtful about her intentions and she insists that I should write every negative thoughts. I'm at a loss here.   \n\n\nWhat can/should I do?",
