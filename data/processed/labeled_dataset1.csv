post_01823,"my 10 year old brother tried to kill himself yesterday  he hung himself on the top bunk of his bed, thankfully my dad caught him just as he passed out and saved his life. i don't understand how he even knew to do that.

there was no indication beforehand that he would do this and i have no idea why he did it. he lives a more normal life than i do ffs hes physically active and has friends and good grades and a supportive family and no prior history of mental illness. 

when asked why he would do this he just mumbled something about missing his aunt who died a year ago. i doubt that's the only reason but he just keeps saying he doesn't know.

i've been suicidal myself but i've always been too scared to go through with it, he's literally the he last person i'd ever expect to do something like this.

how do we keep him safe? how do we get him to tell us what's going on? he's such as sweet kid and i'm scared i'm gonna turn a corner and find him dead one day. help

post_05795,"i'm a home wrecker so i was approached by an officer that works in the county i'm on parole in. we started talking on the dl. we got intimate and could barely keep off each other. she told me she was pregnant the same day she told me she was married. 

assuming i was gonna start a new life with this woman, i attached myself emotionally. we've had to keep this a secret due to her whole entire life falling apart if anyone found out. 

one thing i resent her for is she told me if the baby was mine she would consider not keeping it, but if it was her husbands she'd keep it. that hurt my feelers. but play stupid games win stupid prizes. 

anyway fast forward 10 months. she hasn't left her husband, but tells me she wants to. and we still have a heavy lust driven type of relationship. i want to be able to forget about her, but am struggling leaving it all behind me. 

so much damn drama. 

but it's still a secret due to many reasons. 
i feel much better having typed it out actually. 

and i thought i'd feel like a pos but i don't. 

cops have been screwing me all my life, it's nice to be able to screw back lmao. and she is an amazing woman besides the cheating, sneaking, lying, etc. 

anywho 

all the glory to god
have a great year ya'll

post_02091,"raped, reported, ruined last year, i was raped. i tried to report it to my manager. he thought i was lying, even when i cried begging him to investigate it. he forced me to take time off, over which time he happened to hear allegations about me from anonymous sources. i had to leave. i have not been able to get work since, in part due to the rumors they spread about me. 

noone from the organisation has spoken to me in a while now. i've had some therapy, but those have run out now. i havent had dreams for close to a year, only nightmares. 

i am incredibly isolated. the only reason i haven't ended myself is because my husband talked me out of it. but i'm on the brink. we considered moving city but my reputation has been that tarnished. 

i don't know what to do. i was raped, i tried to report it, and now i feel ruined.

post_07556,"feeling overwhelmed and hopeless i don't know how much longer i can go on like this. every day feels like a battle that i am losing more and more. the darkness inside me is suffocating, and the weight on my shoulders is becoming unbearable. i feel like i'm drowning in a sea of despair with no lifeline in sight.  my relationships are crumbling, and i feel like a burden to everyone around me. the constant struggle to keep up appearances and pretend that i'm okay is draining me of whatever little energy i have left. the thought of reaching out for help seems daunting, as i fear judgment and rejection.  i've tried therapy and medications, but nothing seems to ease the pain that consumes me from the inside out. the loneliness is deafening, and the future looks bleak and desolate. i keep asking myself if this is all there is to life, and if it's worth enduring this agony day in and day out.  the idea of ending it all creeps into my mind more often than i'd like to admit. the thought of escaping this torment feels like the only way out. it's hard to see any light at the end of the tunnel when all i feel is darkness surrounding me.  i know there are people out there who are suffering just like me, and it breaks my heart to know that so many of us are fighting silent battles. if you're reading this and feeling the same way, please know that you're",1

post_00840,"my wife attempted suicide wednesday afternoon my wife took a massive amount of medication. she texted me a photo of two piles of pills and said ""goodbye. i'm sorry."" i was at my parents apartment in the same building as ours, so i ran to our apartment, but she locked me out. i beat on the door over and over yelling for her to open up, and when she finally did, she just stumbled across the floor and fell on her bed, gagging and crying. i called 911 and held her head up and tried to keep her awake. she was vomiting everywhere. the paramedics carried her out of the apartment and down to a stretcher and i sped to the er right behind them. they gave me a number to call in the er to get updates, and all they kept saying was that she was in very critical condition and they're doing their best to stabilize her. she was vomiting so much that they couldn't pump her stomach and had to put her on a ventilator. hours went by that felt like days, and the dr finally called and said that they stabilized her, she was on a ventilator, but with the amount of duloxetine she ingested there was a high chance that she'd either be ""brain dead"" or have brain damage. i fell apart. my dad was there to hold me up, but i felt all the wind leave my lungs. my dad took the phone and talked to the dr some more and then he picked me up like i was a kid and got me out of there and into the car. he said there's nothing we can do here. she's in icu, she's gonna pull through, but we're waiting on the ct scan. so he drove us home, i passed out on the couch and at 6am the nurse called to tell us they got her off the ventilator and the scan was negative for brain damage. i threw my clothes on and sped to the hospital and stayed there for 2 days until it was time for her psychological evaluation. they actually said she was of no harm to herself or others and that she didn't require inpatient treatment of any kind. they discharged her to go home. i was speechless. i called her psychiatrist and he was emphatic about her being admitted for psychiatric treatment. she refused and said she just wanted to go home. now, we have 2 autistic children. i am on short term disability for a migraine that's been going since early may, every day, and i'm not responding to any treatment. my head's a 8/10 on the pain scale nearly every day. i'm seeing a neurologist tomorrow, finally, but i've been at home on bed rest since may 17th with an ice bag on my head. times are really tough. but now they want her to go home and for me to keep a ""suicide watch"" on her, to keep pills and sharp objects out of her reach. to find her outpatient therapy. to follow up with her psychiatrist and pcp. i can barely make myself a sandwich right now. so we brought her back home and the universe came calling. it was her psychiatrist who she's been seeing for 17 years. he said that if she doesn't follow his medical advice and admit herself to a mental health hospital, then he had no other recourse than to drop her as a patient. at that point, she got up, started getting herself together and said ok find me somewhere to go. i got her admitted to a reputable hospital that her psychiatrist recommended and i haven't heard from her since. i'm lost. i'm stuck between falling apart and angrier than i've ever been in my entire life. and my head is banging...just pounding. i asked my parents to take the kids until this blows over, and all i've been doing is crying, then i stop and get so mad...just furious. then i break down again. i talked to my therapist and my spiritual advisor and they both helped a lot. but i'm so, so broken. i'm so confused. what did i do to make this happen? i just cry myself to sleep wondering what she's doing and what i'm going to when she comes home. i've never been so scared of something in my life. what if she does this again? what about the kids? they're autistic, they don't understand the complexity of what's going down. what if they find something really wrong with my brain? i feel like i'm standing at the edge of a cliff in the middle of a wind storm, trying to keep my balance, trying to be strong, but knowing that sooner or later i'm going to fall. and everyone is depending on me. and for whatever reason, my wife, my best friend, the mother of my kids, after 14 years together just said ""goodbye. i'm sorry."" where the hell do we even go from here?",1
post_03663,"i had a break down today so i haven't cried in a while, so um, this was kind of a shock. today should have been a normal day. i go to work early. i come back late kind of day, but um no. at work, i have this friend who put me down in a joking way? it sounds weird, it is. they're just new.i guess but we've been friends for a while, so they're making it a thing to try to do my job for me and treating me like i don't know how to do my job and making fun of me to the customers which is kind of upsetting a lot. so i had to deal with that, and then i come home and i remembered, i did one of my first projects for for a class turns out i didn't end up doing it the correct way. i thought i did this assignment so well that i didn't check back until the due date to hand in your revised assignments was a day late. fun fact my teacher and keep in mind.this is her first impression she was upset, because not only was my assignment a day late. but also i  handed it in sideways and so i can't even revise it because surprise surprise.it's a day late  again for revisions:) oh. and not only that, i tried to call my mom about it and what i got back was well, you did your assignment wrong. they're gonna come down hard on you. i don't know what you want from me basically. keep in mind that i'm really emotional. so probably wasn't as bad as i thought, but i felt so unsupported that i just and did the call with my mom cuz, she had to go and i just cried ii don't know why i just. i cried a lot i was so upset. this is a really, isn't that big in the breakdown? i don't even know why i'm so upset i just am i don't know. i think this all boils down to. i'm just really upset and feel very unsupported and overwhelmed, because of college, this feels so pathetic to be upset about, and it probably is, but i don't know i'm still upset about it. i don't know what to do with these feelings. besides, get my college work done and just try not to think about it",0
post_01612,"i lost all my friends. i'm 17 and ever since i was young i've had depression, though i was only officially diagnosed last year (acute depressive disorder). a couple months back i've made a huge mistake of lashing out at someone i use to deem close to, due to stress and mental pressure, i've regretted those actions and apologized since then, but as days go by i've lost contact or been cut off by most of my friends due to the incident.

here i am, a couple months after, shunned away from everyone. i'm not really the social type so i don't have anyone to call my friends in school either. and currently all i could think about is finding a method that could kill me quickly and painlessly. it gets so bad that i've already tied a noose and wrote a letter, though i've never told anyone, because there's noone else to tell it to. since i don't have a support system anymore to try and help talk to me about it.

i've tried and continued changing myself for the better ever since i've lashed out but i can't really bring myself to meet new people. i'm stuck here thinking the same thoughts about how i could've done better back then and that noone and absolutely noone would mind if i'd just die, and maybe ""that"" someone would even celebrate. i know that this may seem miniscule compared to other people's problems in here but i seriously see no way out other than death, i have such a bleak future. ending it, is all i could think about it, and i wish at some point soon, i'd eventually have the guts to go through with it completely.",1
post_05461,"cool off/space hi, my boyfriend asked a space from me because he wants to heal and better himself but his friends are tolerating him to break up with me so that he can flirt someone from school. me and my boyfriend were super in good terms before he asked for a space. the reason was he wanted to have time for himself but he didn't want us to break up. 

he said he doesn't like hurting me because he often has anger issues. i understood that so i agreed to let us cool off first, i gave him time for himself to breath. after a few days he chatted with me, he said he misses me. after that, he told me that his friends were telling him to break up with me because there were other girls that he could do with him and treat him better. i got upset with his friends but i can't say that he should leave it because they were the only friends he had here in our country. 

now i'm overthinking because of the people he hangs out with, maybe i'm nervous because he might continue while we only talked about him healing. we are also in ldr and yes i trust him, but those around him don't have it, they also tend to insist him or tolerate him. he's also very kind, he doesn't want to disappoint his friends sometimes. now i'm waiting here, i don't know if it's still worth it. i know he is worth it, but it is draining when there's people like them are around him.",0

post_05602,"i think my boyfriend is lying to me, am i overthinking? hey! this is my first time posting on reddit so apologies if it's weird lol.
i, (19f) have been with my bf (21m) for almost five years and since we started our relationship a clear boundary of mine has been not to watch porn, and i had this gut feeling a few weeks ago that he watched it and i gen found it on his history. we almost broke up tbh, i feel like porn is cheating in a way as why are u wanking over someone else? but everyone around me feel like i was being dramatic even him, he swore down his mums life and he even laughed at my face and i just cannot get over it, he's apologised but he refuses to talk about it again. i am trying to forgive him but the thing is he's still deleting his history..? he's told me it's because he knows i don't like him gambling but i join in with him every now and then, i only complain when he spends a lot of money which i think is a valid reason. or he says it's a habit. 
i've found a way to check his history even though he deletes it but i'm almost scared in some way? he's my first everything and i love him so much and tbh i have a lot going on other then him so if i find he's still doing it idk what to do, i know in my head i should leave him if i find it but my head is so muffled with everything on going at home and with education plus work that idk if i can be bothered. he's genuinely the only person i have and that understands my situation too and he has been really patient with me atm. and i got to admit if he's not watching it i'm going to feel like shit but this gut feeling has came back. 
do u think i'm just overthinking the relationship and should just leave it or do u think i should check his history because i'm genuinely in too minds? 
all advice would be appreciated! :) ",0

post_05132,"bit of junk i feel i need to release & some recent happenings that are eating me alive, i'd love to hear other thoughts on the matters just to help me feel like i'm not going insane!? i've always admired and had upmost respect for the uk police force. i have zero criminal convictions, worked consistently and at a high standard. i loved my job, so much. we were building machinery that was capable of weighing medication to a milligram and could also detect discrepancies on the presses or capsules etc. honestly it was such a dream come true, i was so proud when i'd spend hundreds of hours building and testing- seng it off to qc and see that it'd passed and the stats of accuracy i'd accomplished. 

life was great!

until cocaine and ketamine (and booze but not heavily at all) entered my life, me being an impulsive individual - as i can guess you can tell this is going to go south very rapidly. 

now i think back i do understand what started to go wrong and when, i was going out a lot for beers in the evening. i didn't ever really have friends nearby as all my best pals moved away to make the most of their lives and i'm still so proud and luckily back in contact with them new. 

i was in a relationship that lasted around 7 years, i loved her so much and always will in a way. she was nothing but amazing and i'm so happy she is happy and stable. i just lost the feelings, something i struggle to put in to words but yes i loved her but i didn't love her like i once did. i couldn't find myself showing her or physically engaging in love like we once did. the realisation was pure agony, i knew i had to end it with my childhood sweetheart beautiful girlfriend because i wasn't feeling the same anymore. i ended it as respectfully as i could, face to face chat just brutal honesty.. it was so fucking awful but i knew it wasn't fair as i felt like i was leading her on at this point.

i was becoming a toxic person with my drug addiction too so i most definitely did her a huge favour by ending it when i did. 

  
but the dynamic of our friendship group had just shattered for me, i was no longer a part of it. i was no longer a part of the best circle of friends i ever had and i do understand why but my god it cut so deep.

  
this sent me so far into my addiction, ended up having to rent half a house off of my uncle who is as toxic as they come. one night we got drunk, he stole some of my diazepam and literally turned into the devil. saying such awful stuff about those closest to me, telling me i was a waste of family. it got too far and i stuck up for myself when he was screaming in my face. bare in mind amidst my addiction i was 6.2 and probably 160bls just skin and bone. he is the same height but around 45 years old and 220lbs at least. he started beating me all around my part of the property, i still have pictures of the damage. he had these nice thick cast iron radiators that were tubular but pointy at the same time, i remember just being picked up and thrown into the radiators, full football kicks to the ribs. my back was completely blue red, and black with bruising. i had to call my dad to come and help me because i couldn't move and my uncle was going psycho. i can't imagine how hard this was for my dad to see and it digs so deep knowing i put him through this.

post this event, the whole side of the family decided to shun me and everything was my fault because the place was ""untidy"". 

now i'm built up and would throw him around like a fucking frisbee but i know this is going to do me no favours whatsoever so i won't do it. but i lost half my family for this.

sorry, i'm really ranting on now and i apologise for this probably being barely followable.

anyway, after this i became homeless completely. i slept under a carpark and in a few nasty shelters round bristol, bath, trowbridge and finally chippenham. so many more traumatising events happened around these times. i tried ending my life more times than i can count.

i even went down the self harm route, which is something i look back at now. i can't not because everywhere i look there's a different scar. i've learnt to use this as a tool to remember how far i've come since this point though and it does work but in the summer i just look like a butchers experiment. i literally stabbed myself through my leg in desperation for someone to understand the pain i was in mentally. life is so fucking crazy.

but, i'm now just over a year sober. doing amazing. life is starting to shine again. all of my family are behind me with full support and my heart is full. but recently, some weirdo broke into my bedroom when i was sound asleep and i did what i did to defend myself. what am i supposed to do, just let this ballied up man break in and potentially kill me? so  i threw a punch in self defence and was arrested for grevious bodily harm with intent. the punch is on camera and i'm not going to lie about it. but the police have completely failed me, they didn't get the correct cctv in time showing him breaking into my room (i'm on the phone to the police shit scared whilst this is happening btw).

i did do him damage but you can see that the one punch was just a jab, there was no hook just jabbed him away. and for that i've potentially ruined the rest of my life. 

  
the police have been nothing but useless, and just well... disgusting. 

  
i had such high hopes. i get jumped by a group of men who robbed me of everything recoreded on cctv and they get away with it.  me, i act in self defence scared for my lfie and i'm potentially looking at gbh/wi.

  
i've worked so hard to get my life in order, i've volunteered, ran a half marathon for a charity, been sober for over a year now and now it all just feels pointless. 

  
this post has turned into a real release for me so i'm sorry about the terrible formatting, but any words or advice or literally anything would be so so so very much appreciated! 

  
i'm lost 

thank you

post_06168,"gillette commercial ad what the fuck.  so i've (21m) been hearing a lot of things about the ""controversial"" gillette ad these past few days.  i usually don't pay attention to this kind of thing but the video popped up while i was browsing youtube.  1.1 million dislikes over ~600 k likes.  now seeing this i thought to myself ""wow, how controversial can an ad get to have more dislikes than likes?"".  so naturally i watched the thing.

it's a video telling you to behave like a decent fucking human being.  why the fuck are people so mad about this?  if you're mad over this fucking ad, that tells me a lot about your shit personality.  if this ad personally offended you, i can tell what kind fucked up shit you probably did to your peers.  there is nothing controversial about this.  in the video there's a father stopping a child from getting bullied.  there's a man stopping his friend from cat-calling a woman.  there's a man de-escalating a situation.  

the only people that would find this controversial are the misogynistic neck beards that are going to have to ""find"" another razor company to tame their filthy facial fecal hairs due to all the bullshit they're sprouting.

so gillette, as a college male i still find your razors pretty over-priced, but i really hope you don't apologize for that ad, because i think it was great fucking message.

i can understand why people commit suicide. and i think it's selfish for loved ones of those who did commit to call them selfish for ""leaving them"". no. 

a person suffering from severe mental health conditions that cause them to be suicidal - they can do all the work to get better. they can go to therapy, they can take their medication, they can go to the gym and eat healthy, they can work and save money, they can be social and see their friends and family every other day, they can study for a degree they really want… but once those feelings of depression, and loneliness and isolation and emptiness come back for them, it's so easy to forget the good things you have in your life (i.e. a loving family, a good job, a good gym routine, whatever it is).

but to expect your loved one who has committed suicide to continue living in this vicious cycle of being well and then unwell (whether it's because of trauma, a diagnosed disorder, a chemical imbalance, etc) - that is selfish. because unless they also suffer from mental health issues that cause suicidal thoughts and ideation, they will never understand the severity of their condition. they will never understand why they want to die despite all the good things they have in their life. 

so for someone who has been successful in their suicide attempt, i can totally understand why they did it. even if it's someone who isn't doing the work to get better (i.e. no therapy, no meds - just straight rawdogging), i can still understand why they want to die and commit suicide, or why they committed suicide.

i am not at all saying that you should go about committing suicide. i think everyone's life is important and can be meaningful despite their mental health issues. however, if they do feel this way and do try or do end up killing themselves, i would never call them selfish for it because i understand why they would do, or did what they did.

post_00222,"self harm for relief? without calling 911 hi, i'm 23f

i was just in the er for self harm (paracetamol overdose) and then i spent 3 days in a psych ward

i am planning on doing it again. i plan to take atleast 15g of paracetamol just to make myself throw up and sick.

i just want the relief that it brings. but this time, i am not calling 911 or telling anyone what i am doing. because the overdose doesn't actually put me in danger. my liver was fine, i just ended up throwing up painfully which is what i want.

when i was in the er one of the nurses pointed out that i was there often. that made me realise that their resources are not infinite and i shouldn't abuse them. i don't want to go to the er again

post_01004,"i want to die but i really don't want to. i just want these thoughts to stop.  but they've been happening for 15+ years.  i am so tired of the same bullshit. over and over again. i have bpd so my life is a fucking mess and always will be, till the day i finally stop breathing. god i hope that day is soon. and i hope it's not by my own hand. 

when i'm happy, i feel so hopeful and like i'm on top of the world. i can't even understand why i'm depressed, or why i get like this. it's like i think i'm lying almost. like i gaslight myself into thinking that it's over and i will finally be at peace. but peace never comes. no matter how much ""progresss"" i make, it never comes. 

feeling that happy may sound nice and i can't lie, in the moment it feels incredible. i literally feel unstoppable. but the crash is hard. you know the feeling when you set a goal for yourself only to not reach it? you feel bummed out right? well, i feel emotions very strongly. so when that crash happens, i hate myself. i feel like a failure. and this happens every 2 weeks. almost like fucking clockwork, can you believe it?

when i'm sad, like now, all i want to do is die. the only answer is to crawl inside a hole, and die. i feel like i have 1000 pounds strapped to my ankles and someone is telling me to run for my life. i'm so discouraged and tired. so fucking tired

i write a lot in my journal and on my google docs when i get like this. the line i've written the most is ""i'm so tired."" i only started writing in 2018 when i was 20 years old. 

i wish i could just give someone else this opportunity to live because i dont deserve it. i can't get myself to love it. 

i have a husband and a daughter and when i'm happy, i can't ever picture myself leaving. i can't even understand why on earth i have these thoughts, it's like i'm a different person who's trying to understand someone else's insane mental illness. only i can't understand it and i judge it. 

but now that i'm sad, i feel horrible for making them go through these mood swings. 

i'm a product of shitty parents and brothers who didn't love me and made me feel like i was a wasted space. all of them. literally each of them. sometimes, the parent being around isn't the best option. and that's exactly how i feel about me and my daughter. i feel like i am going to fail her, that i already have. when i get mad, i get so fucking angry. i see red, i scream, i don't care for anyone's feelings. shes fucking 5 years old and shes seen my anger. i've yelled at her before. several times. i am going to ruin her life the way my mom ruined mine. 

the worst part? i can't control my anger. i have been this way since i was in middle school. 

the solution? i'm dead. i'm not alive to get angry. it's also the solution to my mood swings is it not? if i'm dead, i'm not feeling emotions. i'm not thinking of the past. i'm not thinking of when my brother sexually abused me for 5 years of my life. i'm not thinking of the times my dad would scream at me and tell me i was weak because i felt sad all the time. i'm not thinking of the fact that my mom knows what my brother has done yet she still tells me she loves him. i'm not thinking of how my other brother told me i was stupid every single day of my pathetic life to the point that as a 26 year old, i still hear him say it and i still feel so fucking dumb. 

i just want this to stop. i want all of it to stop. i don't even want to die. i really truly don't. i want to watch my daughter graduate. i want to be there for her. i want to spend more time with my wonderful husband. but they don't deserve this. ",1

• call your girlfriend the wrong name and see what happens
• record your boyfriend whilst you answer a fake facetime from another guy

post_04748,"please stop medication shaming this is a psa to the anxiety community. it's bad enough when you get it from people who don't even understand the concept of having anxiety, it's 10x worse when it comes from people within the community who also suffer from anxiety disorders.

goddamn i get it left and right from fellow anxiety sufferers the very moment i mention that i'm on medication. it always turns into preaching. you may think you're helping, but you're really not. there are many different preachy topics people get into, but the main sentiments are ""oh, you're just not strong enough and are weak and leaning on the meds because not using them would be too hard for you."" or ""oh they're really bad for you if you keep taking those you're going to end up with dementia-cancer by the age of 30"" 

fuck off. i experienced something traumatic. i was not able to handle it without the assistance of meds. therapy alone did not cut it. going for walks outside or whatever didn't help either, which some people smugly like to suggest. i was in so much fear that i literally disassociated from myself. meds kept me from being hospitalized.

i got shit from my doctor and people on here (not this sub specifically i haven't commented here before). you're going to die horribly for being on those meds! be afraid! be scared! feel ashamed!

well guess what, i found a fantastic therapist who completely understands my plight. in one of our first sessions when i told her that the meds saved my life and that therapy alone wouldn't have ever helped, she immediately agreed and was like ""oh yep definitely. it's too powerful of a reaction/feeling. i know."" she herself experienced some trauma from her past, and she told me that when she stopped drinking and was on an anti-anxiety med for her panic disorder someone smugly told her ""oh so you dropped one addiction for another."" oh boy did i have some shared anger with her over that. 

i really don't care to hear anyone's ""help"" or ""advice"" when it comes to my choice to take medications. i don't want your shaming, or how you were able to overcome your issues without medication, good for you. i don't want to hear how bad it is for me health-wise. there's this holier-than-thou preachy mindset disguised as sympathy and i fucking hate it. oooooooo they're so bad for you! guess what's also bad for me? not eating or sleeping or fulfilling basic biological needs to survive due to fear. hm. wonder which is worse?

i would rather live a shorter happier life due to relief from my anxiety due to meds than live a long tortuous life because that's what people say i should do. my doctor was brutal to me about being on the meds until i said essentially that to her, and then she finally laid off. 

and addiction doesn't happen to everybody. i had someone lecture me on how this medication i was on was going to give me a full blown addiction until i told them that once i was doing better i just simply got off of them and was off of them for months. they sure didn't have anything to say to that. 

so bottom line, stop shaming people who choose medications, if you want to celebrate that you're so healthy and untainted by pharmaceuticals, go do it somewhere else. not everyone is that lucky. yes i'm bitter.

edit: to be clear all of this mostly comes from the fact that i take **benzos,** which are apparently a big no-no to many people. i'm not sure if i would have had the same experience from people if i were taking non-benzos. people really love to scare me about those. but they saved my life and continue to do so, so, *shrug.*",0

-cheated with multiple women (i caught him f*cking another girl in my bed when i was at work)
-drugged me(i have never took drugs or even been drunk before)
-raped me after he drugged me. (i couldn't function but was still aware) 
-constantly took money from me
-was physically abusive (at first he was apologetic but after awhile he didn't even care)
-gave me an std (not curable)
-screaming and cussing almost daily over the smallest things.
-would take the keys to the car when we fought 
-broke things in the house when he would rage
-told me he would have the courts take our child from me because i have anxiety. even though the anxiety stemmed from the way he treated me. 
-constant remarks about my weight and or appearance 
-very controlling on how much money i spent or what i wore

-would rage out when i found his stash of pills when cleaning
-made fun of me on facebook and wouldn't add me as a friend or put that he was in a relationship 
-never let me have his phone password and would start fights when i questioned his activity due to his past infidelity's 
-he would buy himself takeout and bring it home while me and my daughter ate the low cost meat i could afford.
-driving recklessly when he got mad when i was in the car. 

there's a lot more but that is the main things i can think of right now. this man is the most terrifying human i've ever met. many of his coworkers loved him. nobody knew how bad it was. i was terrified for me and my daughter and i'm thankful we're alive. trauma bonds are really hard to break and i never thought i'd leave. i have my first therapy appointment in the morning and hopefully it goes well.

post_06541,"my brother tried to have sex with me my brother (20m) was high and attempted to kiss me(21f) and grabbed my breats. he confessed he has sister incest fetish, tried to convince me to try something, asked me to reconsider, to at least touch him. after he finally realized this will never happen, he asked me to not tell anyone and promised to never bring it up again.
after 3 days of not speaking, i gave him a long speech how betrayed and disgusted i was, and how he should quit porn. he blamed it on being high. we started talking again, everything resumed like nothing happened.

and mostly my life hasn't changed, except now i have violent horrifying nightmares of him trying to rape me. i feel like my whole body is frozen as i try to wake myself up.
i genuinely don't know what to do. sometimes i'm disgusted by myself for still talking with him and acting like nothing happened. i haven't told a single soul about any of this. i don't know if i should tell a friend or get a therapist. i don't feel like i'm under danger or that he will attempt anything like this again, but those nightmares terrify me so much and make me feel so helpless.

edit: this situation happened back in april, and he didn't attempt anything since, that's why i don't think he'll do this again. he's also planning to move away soon, so i don't think we'll see each other often.

some people also mentioned it probably wasn't weed but some other drug, and looking back they are probably right. i've seen him high many times before and after this incident, but that day he went to the bathroom and when he returned his behavior was very unusual.

reporting him to police realistically won't have any legal consequences for him. telling to my parents is way too scary for many reasons, and it seems too much to unload on a friend either. i will however try to gather enough courage to go to a therapist and start locking my bedroom door at night. thank you for your advice and kind words.",1

post_05325,"i don't think i want to marry my girlfriend anymore. i'm gonna be very blunt, i feel wrong for feeling this way. but it's how i feel, and i want to get it off my chest and can't afford a therapist.

me (23nb/m) and my gf (23f) have been dating for three years. we moved in together about 6 months ago. i thought it was a great idea considering i felt really in love with her, we meshed together well for the most part personality wise, and it seemed like our goals were aligned for what we wanted out of life. we both want to be young home owners, have at least two kids, and facilitate stable lives for ourselves. so, i figured it'd be a good idea to move out, and to try this adulting thing for real, on our own, separate from our parents. we got a 2 bed 2 bath, and the location was phenomenal. 

i thought this would be great. but i don't know, something doesn't sit right with me about our relationship anymore after 6 months of living together. i feel under appreciated, disrespected, and just kind of like an accessory to her. 

i'm very loving, many would call me a golden retriever boyfriend. i wait for the moment my partner gets back to reconnect with them, ask them how their day was, how they're feeling, ask if i can get them anything, etcetc. when i greet my gf with this behavior, she seems irritated more often than not, mostly being distant or mean to me because she's tired or overstimulated, supposedly. while i understand those feelings very well, it doesn't feel like an excuse to be cold. and i've voiced these feelings before, only for the behavior to be repeated multiple times. 

meanwhile when she calls friends or family when she's in one of these moods, she's perfectly capable of presenting a smile and having a cheery conversation. it seems to only be me who gets this cold attitude.

something else, on that note, that bothers me is her priority of her family that comes explicitly at my expense. let me elaborate. her dad takes her on cruises every year, and thats really cool that they get to experience that. i love that she gets to travel the world and spend that time with her dad. however, the issue comes in with how she's told me she would put these cruises over important life events or dates for the two of us. i was joking around with her one day back while i was in college and asked if she would miss my graduation for a cruise, and she said with no hesitation, yes. while this was only a hypothetical, it felt cruel. what felt worse was when she doubled down on a take like this by accepting a cruise her dad scheduled months in advance that would happen to be departing literally on the day of our anniversary. i voiced my frustration with this when the cruise was initially mentioned, which was more than 6 months in advance from departure. she did not once ask her dad if he could look into rescheduling or even tell him that that was our anniversary. all she cared about was her own luxury.

i don't know. i'm just rambling, and there's definitely more that's contributing to these feelings i am having. i am also a poc and she is not, and i am outraged by the current political climate and she seems to simply not care, that's another thing that's been bothering me. but i guess my only solution to something like this, after i have already tried talking to her and voicing my concerns and tried setting out plans to improve our relationship…. i feel like i just need to leave for my own health. but we live together, and neither could afford to live on our own, and neither has the space nor vehicle to move all the furniture we have together in our apartment. it feels like itd be too hard to take that step.",0

my anxiety just goes ""well last time you were at this stage, the guy you were seeing was sleeping with other girls bc you wouldn't spread your legs, its why he didn't commit"" because the guy im seeing now has hit the stage where we both admitted we have feelings for each other but we haven't made it official. which im fine with, i'm happy to move slow bc we want to build something that will last, but my anxiety makes it the worst.

i went to one of his frat's parties and he was being his awkward self in a corner when a random drunk girl was clearly making him uncomfortable, when he gets nervous he rubs his chest. when he saw me he clearly got excited and stopped doing his nervous tick, i know he's not interested in other girls and i know i can trust him but my anxiety doesn't listen. even though at the party he ""threatened"" a sorority sister he thought i had upset me (it was a different sister, but he was drunk and his heart was in the right place) 

i mean i feel like a bother and every time i express that he says im not. he reminds me i could never be a bother to him, but i still feel like one. i mean i baked him protein cookies which he was excited about but now he tells me he doesn't feel well and can't come get them right now, i know he's not lying to me bc he jumps at every opportunity to come see me, but my brain doesn't get that.

i know we agreed to move slow bc we've both been seriously hurt in the past and we want to build smt that will last but part of this is killing me. he doesn't want to tell his frat brothers bc he doesn't want the to meddle cuz he's still a new member and his frat is harsh- idk im proud to be with him and i know he has feelings for me, he's said it over and over, but idk why he doesn't want to tell people? im over to moon to have him in my life bc he's so patient with me, and ik guys are different about this stuff, but that nagging feeling just gets me. 

again, if i tell him i feel this way, he's reassure me and explain why, i know there's no other girls, but my anxiety doesn't. i hate this mindset and i hate that no matter how much i see him and know it's just me i cant remember that. 

i mean his eyes light up every time he sees me, he acted like he didn't care when i almost didn't come to the frat party but he got so excited when i was.

post_07408,"feeling lost and hopeless, struggling to find a way out lately, life has become a never-ending cycle of pain and emptiness. it's like i'm stuck in a dark tunnel with no light at the end. the weight of my struggles is crushing me, and i can't see a way out. every day feels like a battle i'm losing, and the thought of ending it all creeps into my mind more often than not.  i've tried reaching out for help, but it feels like no one truly understands the depth of my despair. the loneliness is suffocating, and the constant feeling of being a burden to others only adds to the pain. i wish i could make sense of the chaos in my mind, but it's like trying to untangle a knot that only tightens the more you pull.  i know there are people who care about me, but the darkness inside seems to drown out any flicker of hope. the future looks bleak, and the thought of enduring more suffering feels unbearable. i'm lost in a sea of overwhelming emotions, desperately searching for a lifeline to hold onto. is there anyone out there who feels the same way? is there a way to find peace amidst this storm of despair?",1
post_00369,"just bought a shotgun; should i also get a cheap car and go travel before i die? i just bought a shotgun, will be picking it up from bass pro in few days.

  
i was glancing through this subreddit and saw the suggestion to go live a little before one dies.

  
my initial plan was to get the gun and blow my head off in the dorm, or maybe outside to mitigate mess. now, after hearing the idea of spending a little and seeing the world before death, i feel like it kinda jives with me.

a lot of my depression deals with feelings of entrapment: i feel trapped in this body, i feel trapped in my own expectations, i'm terrified of being trapped in a ward again. it most likely relates to the child abuse i faced from my parents (who still run free to this day, despite one of them being taken to court) and the anger subsequent from such an experience.

hell, with a car and numbered days i could go visit the sodden fucks and give them a piece of my mind, i could yell and shout and finally do what i should've done as a kid: stand up for myself. i would never hurt them, not unless they tried to hurt me.

i don't want to kill others along with me, even if they're abusive fuckwads.

  
facebook marketplace has cars for $2000, i could probably secure a car in a week or so. the gun will be ready by then. i would need to make sure nobody has my location through my phone, and i would need to ignore any calls or messages from my few friends or family.

  
what are y'all's thoughts? should i run and then gun? be free for once?

  
thank you",1
post_05580,"car insurance is so stupid some times so i forgot all about this post i was planning to write till my sister reminded me. 

she has her car  insurance renewal come up soon, and when she got the letter from her provider the informed her that her insurance would go up by 28 dollars, even though she has had no accidents and has never had any issues with cancelling or being thrown off of insurance. 

when she told me this i told her that i know of two different excuses insurance comapines give depending on the insurance provider which are :

1. more people had accidents, so we had to raise everyone's rates. (which should onlt effect the people who had accdidents not the people who didn't ) 

2. more accidents happened with your cars make and model which cause it to go up for everyone with that vehicle (which so doesn't make sense) 

when i told her this she didn't beleive me a first so she called the insurance company to find out why her rates were going up and not down (like they should if you have had no accidents) 

after the call sheooked pissed and i asked which excuse did they give 1 or 2, she confirmed it was 2 and she didn'tike that. 

she has had a licence since 2007 and has a clean drving record,  but regardless of that she is getting a increase to her insurance. 

i honestly think it's insane that insurance companies can do this, when my parents were our ages their insurance costs went down every year, in the last few years a i have seen is insurance rates alot go up

my only theory is they want to keep reporting record braking profits and keep their share holders happy. i makes me sick that something we are required to have to drive has gotten to this level of greed..... 

and what really sucks is we have no power to fight them with as it's a requirement to drive. 

i think a insurance needs a major over haul. ",0

post_02391,"i was sexually assaulted last night and i want to die last night i was coming home from a night out with friends and was very intoxicated. while i was walking, a man approached me. he was smiling weirdly and acting very strange, so i told him to stay away from me. no one else was around. 

he then lunged at me and forced his hand down my pants and underwear, grabbing me down there. it hurt. he held my arms behind my back so i couldn't try to stop him. i started screaming and telling him to stop, and trying to run away from his grasp. i remembered i had pepper spray, but i couldn't reach it in my bag since he was holding my arms back. by some miracle, a few people appeared off in the distance and so eventually he saw them approaching and he let me go.

i sprinted ran the rest of the way home.  i was horrified, disgusted, disturbed, scared, and in my drunken state all i wanted to do was kill myself. i tried cutting my arms with a kitchen knife, but it wasn't sharp enough. i sat in the shower for hours crying and screaming, wishing i would die in my sleep that night. 

today, i told my friends and family what happened. i'm no longer an immediate risk for suicide in this moment, but i am still spiraling. i am so disturbed and disgusted and don't know how to live with myself after this horrible act was done to me.

please any advice on what to do or how to cope and heal would be very helpful. i'm already in therapy so of course i will do that but could really use some support and encouragement. ",1

post_05034,"my ex refuses to send me my belongings after years of asking. 
hi everyone, i just need to vent because i feel kind of ridiculous being so emotional and upset about this. i (26 f) was in a relationship with my ex (40 m) a few years ago. back in 2019, i moved from california to arkansas to be with him after dating long distance for a few months. at the time, i was in a rough spot with my family, and he convinced me to move in with him (though he denies ever doing that). in hindsight, we weren't very compatible, and after facing a lot of disrespect from his family—who were racist toward me because i'm mexican—i decided i couldn't take it anymore and moved back to california in 2021.
being young and hopeful, i thought the relationship might still work out, so we kept up with the long-distance thing. before leaving arkansas, i left behind some of my things, including my cow plushie collection, which holds a lot of sentimental value. some of the plushies were given to me by my father, who passed away in 2015, and others were from my grandmother, who passed in 2024.
the last time i saw him was christmas 2021, and i asked him to pack up my stuff and send it to me. he agreed, but ""forgot."" we broke up in march 2022, and since then, i've been asking him to send my things, especially my cows. i don't care about anything else; i just want my plushies. but he keeps saying it's not a priority for him, and it's ""not on his radar.""
i know it's a big ask, but i've offered to pay for shipping, give him extra money, or even come pick them up myself. he says he's not busy, but the response is always the same. i last spoke to him a few days ago about it, and he said it's not a priority and he's not sure if he even has my stuff but that he'll clean out his attic or barn to check.
i'm so frustrated and feel powerless. part of me knows i should just let it go, but i can't seem to. i feel like i'm being strung along, and i'm exhausted from crying and pleading for something that should be simple. it just feels like a power move on his part to keep communication going, and i'm done with him.
i know it might sound ridiculous to be so upset over stuffed animals, but they mean a lot to me. if anyone has advice on how to either get him to send them or how to let go of this, i'd really appreciate it. thank you.

post_06515,"my girlfriend passed away yesterday i'm not exactly sure what i expect to get out of this. maybe some perspective from those who have had this kind of loss. maybe just to vent since my family and friends are all probably asleep right now this early in the morning. i've never posted here and i hope this is an appropriate sub. it'll feel awful if this all gets deleted because i didn't read the sub's rules carefully.

my girlfriend died. i try not to actually say it because it kind of feels like saying it makes it real, even if that's not rational and reality is what it is regardless of if i have the courage to admit it. i feel like calling her my girlfriend isn't giving a proper picture of our relationship. we've been together for years and have a child who's not even 3 yet. there were reasons we didn't get married, but i'd hate to understate the love and bond we had. have. i thought of her as a wife. i expected to grow old and ugly with her. i want nothing more than just to have her here with me and our child.

i'm just kind of feeling broken. i'm a single father now and while i have a lot of support from family, it never feels like it's enough. it feels like half of me is just gone. i think about ""it'll get better in time"", but ""better"" for me is her coming home. but she won't. in the back of my mind, when i think to just take one step at a time, i realized that what i'm doing is waiting for things to return to normal, but then i realize that's impossible. it isn't fair to her. she's had a lot of hardships in her life and having our child was one of the greatest things to happen to us and being a mom was her greatest wish. becoming parents gave us more meaning to our lives. watching our child grow is some of the happiest parts of our day and she deserved to see that.

the people i might normally talk to are asleep and i'm too exhausted physically and mentally to talk on the phone anyway. i thought that, after coming home from the hospital and after the police had left, i'd feel a little better just getting to be alone. but even with my child running around and everyone offering to talk, i feel so alone. my child sometimes asks about ""mommy"" and looks up to the stairs as if she's coming down after waking up from a nap, and i don't know what to say other than ""mommy is sleeping, but she loves you"". she's a toddler and too young to understand. i also keep looking upstairs and it feels like she should be there. she should be there.

her passing was sudden. she had a seizure while alone in our living room. our child and i were upstairs sleeping. she was talking to someone over the phone and that person is who called 911. i woke up to police in my home, searching for ""a person in distress"". this isn't the fist time she's had a seizure or needed to go to the hospital for it, but this is the first time she didn't wake up. they worked to revive her for maybe 10 minutes while an officer spoke to me/kept me calm and out of the way. they managed to revive her, but she passed on the way to the hospital. i went from immense relief to feeling lower than i ever have before.

it feels like i can't actually be happy. at least not for more than a moment. i see my child doing something cute and i genuinely smile or laugh, but then the moment is gone again. and i actually feel guilty for being happy, even for a second. i put on a happy face to keep my toddler happy, but i feel broken without my wife. i know and i'm committed to being as good a dad as i possibly can, but everything feels overwhelming and wrong. it feels wrong that she's not coming home. it feels wrong that my child lost her mother. it feels wrong that someone so kind is just gone. it feels wrong that it was so abrupt.

i didn't get a chance to say goodbye. she didn't get a chance to say goodbye to me or our child. we weren't fighting, but i didn't even give her a kiss before bed just by chance. we were both just really tired. she was fine and slept before i did. i went to sleep hearing her gently snoring next to me. she woke up before i did and went downstairs. and when i woke up and she's gone. a person whom i love and have spent nearly every day with for several years was just gone.

she's had seizures in the past and if i were there with her instead of sleeping, she might have gotten medical help faster. she might still be here. it's hard not to feel some guilt.

i can say it'll get better and i know it will because i have to raise my child. i don't have the option of crawling in to a corner and hiding, as if my family would let me, but this feeling of loneliness and emptiness and loss and regret will never fade. or it feels like it wont.

i'm not one to be open or vulnerable, especially on the internet, but i appreciate anyone who read through this. there probably aren't words that'll help, but i'd like to think a few people out there will know that my girlfriend was and is a beautiful soul, a wonderful mother, and supportive spouse, and the world is lesser for her not being in it. she lives on in our child and in my heart. i'll still try to get up every day and be the kind of guy she deserves. i just hate that she doesn't get to experience this life with me. and it might be selfish, but i hate that i'm alone without her.

i've been trying to be non-specific, but i suspect anyone who knows her and i will be able to guess what i'm trying to hide. 

i won't hide this, though. i love you, kate. that'll never change. nothing can take you from my heart and our child will know just how wonderful and loving her mother is, even if her mother is gone. i love you.

i'm really tempted to not submit this. it feels too personal. thank you for reading this. tell your friends and family you love them every time you get the chance.

edit: wow, this really took off more than i thought. i kind of just poured myself out here and i'm grateful for so many kind and supportive comments. i had originally intended to respond to all of your comments, but that seems vastly beyond what i'm capable of doing right now. i am absolutely humbled and appreciative of you all, though.

a lot of you also reached out through chat. i didn't even know reddit has a chat function. you've all shown me and my child so much sympathy and so many kind things have been said about kate. it means a lot, even from strangers. everyone has their special someone, and it means the world to me that you'd take a second to think of mine and wish her peace. today feels harder than yesterday, but i know some day the sting of this all won't be so hard to bare. i am making sure to take care of myself and my child and i have family that will join me at my home today. i've basically been alone at home with my toddler since i got home from the hospital saturday, so that should help.

god bless you all and to those we're missing.",1

then the anxiety traveled to my chest where i thought i was having a heart attack so i got a chest x ray and ekg at my primary doctor. everything came back normal of course.

then the 2nd episode of different pupils and headache came on to which i went back to the hospital and got an mri which came back normal.

lastly and now my present anxiety: while i was at the hospital for the second time the iv technician took my blood while inserting the iv and blood started going everywhere. then i also noticed air bubbles in my iv line. so my first thought now is i am going to have an air embolism. now every chest pain or head pain my first thought is the air embolism.

post_05232,"to my great lost love i don't really know how to start this. the very act of trying to find the words feels too overwhelming, as if just making the effort is too much to bear. but every day, it scares me—this constant regret of all the things i never said, now lost forever, drifting away with every passing moment. i don't know if i can make this right, but maybe i should at least try, just once. maybe trying is the only way to find peace in all of this.

it's taken me so long to even begin, let alone continue. every day, i've watched myself avoid these feelings, these unsaid words. i've paused too many times writing, made too many excuses just to run away from the pain, from the truth that i need to do this—not just for you, but maybe for myself also. i can't keep hiding from what i owe, to both you and me. it's been hard, getting here, facing everything i've tried to avoid. but somehow, it feels right, in a way. to let myself be vulnerable again, to open this wound i created and tried to hide for so long. maybe it's not about healing—it's about learning to live with what happened. maybe this time, i can finally let myself face the truth without running.

my room feels darker than it truly is, lit only by the faint, flickering glow of my monitors. the hour has long passed, its midnight, and the cold has begun to run into my skin, going deep into my body as the night passes. i'm growing used to this feeling again—the routine of doing nothing, just sitting here, staring at these screens as if they hold the answer to the emptiness i'm trying to outrun. i've called off the search for my soul, i put them on hold again, telling myself its impossible, when in truth, i know i've just given up on finding it.

i feed myself with endless distractions, each one a momentary attempt to numb the pain inside, a way to escape the weight of what lingers beneath. they offer temporary relief—small bursts of satisfaction that fade almost as quickly as they arrive, leaving me empty again, like an empty room that refuses to be filled. and yet, i keep chasing them, as if one might finally make me forget, might silence these thoughts that has been creeping me, ones that burn like a fever, searing through me as if i'm burning alive. thoughts about what's really happening. thoughts about what's already happened.

the silence around me feels heavy, pressing down harder with every passing moment. it's the kind of silence that amplifies everything i'm trying to escape. and though i know this cycle leads nowhere, i let it continue, because facing the truth feels harder than this endless loop of distractions.

it's so late, isn't it? i've lost track of time, but somehow, that doesn't seem to matter anymore. the hours slip away without me even noticing. i feel like i'm drifting, lost, floating through these moments with no real direction. i wake up thinking of you, and when i fall asleep, it's the same—your presence lingers in my mind, always there. every thought is haunted by you, even when i try to push it away, as if you're woven into the very fabric of my consciousness. how is it now that somehow you're a stranger, but you were mine just yesterday? i don't know how we got here, but it feels so different now. everything has shifted, and i find myself standing in this strange, unfamiliar space, trying to remember what we once had. i don't know what i'm doing. i don't know how i ended up here, in this place of endless questioning. all i know is that somewhere, in the middle of all this confusion, i failed. i lost. and that's the hardest part: admitting it to myself. it feels like the truth is something i can't outrun, something i can't hide from anymore, no matter how hard i try. it sits with me, heavy and undeniable. i'm afraid to say it aloud, but deep down, i know it's true. i've failed, and i don't know how to fix it. it feels too late, doesn't it? too late for anything to be what it should have been. did i crossed the line?

i don't blame you. you can't save me. no one can, but myself. you were trying your best, trying to fill the gaps in the empty void within me. and i can't imagine how much that must have taken from you. i see it now, in everything we've become. i mean, look at where we are now.

you took charge of something you were never supposed to, and that wasn't fair to you. you're just human, a precious being with your own emptiness to handle. i treated you like an extension of me, like something that could make me feel alive again, and that feels so wrong. it feels like i forced you to carry a burden that wasn't yours to bear. and i hate myself for making you feel like that, for making you believe you were a failure, that you weren't enough, that you were just a decoration. you were trying to fix something that was never meant to be fixed, because it wasn't meant to be fixed by anyone else in the first place. it was my brokenness, my weight, and i made it yours.

it all makes sense now, doesn't it? the way we fell apart, how the silence between us grew, how the distance stretched until it became an insurmountable divide. i should have let you be who you were, not something i could cling to in order to make myself feel whole. but now, in the quiet of these empty moments, i finally see that. i realize i failed to understand you, failed to see that you were struggling just like me—that you too got tired, got angry, became anxious, and overthought everything. i was too caught up in my own mind to truly listen to yours, and now i'm left wondering if i could have done something differently.

could we have still been something, if i hadn't acted the way i did? if i had been more patient, less selfish, maybe more understanding of your own battles? or was this always the way it was meant to unfold? i keep asking myself these questions, replaying them over and over in my mind, but all i'm left with are doubts and regret. and the memories—always the memories—is the only thing that remains, the only thing that still holds the weight of what once was. it reminds me of everything i've lost, of every chance i took for granted. it's the only constant in this aftermath, the only piece of you that i can still hold on to. but even that feels like it's slipping away, like everything else i've lost in the wake of it all.

and now, my room feels emptier, in a way that's hard to explain. it's always been empty, but now, it's as if something i once had here is gone. i don't know what it is—it's like a ghost, or maybe a memory, a presence that was here, but now it's simply vanished. it started to fade months ago, little by little, like sunlight dimming behind thick clouds, the sky growing heavy, the clouds turning darker, and a storm quietly gathering on the horizon. and now, it's completely gone. it's like the feeling of you, of us, slipping through my fingers, like trying to hold onto sand that falls no matter how tightly i grip. i reach for it in the air, hoping some trace will remain, but it slips away, dissolving before i even understand what i'm losing. the air feels heavier, quieter, as if it's closing in on me. every small sound echoes longer in the silence, reminding me of how empty everything has become. i try to fill it with something—anything—but nothing stays. it feels like the silence itself is swallowing everything whole, taking everything with it. and yet, it's not just the room. it's me. i can feel myself emptying, piece by piece, the weight of missing you pulling everything else away, leaving only a fragment of me. i don't know how to stop it, or if i even can.

i started doing things again—old habits i had forgotten about, things that used to come naturally. they all welcomed me back, as if they had been waiting for me, patiently holding space for my return. but there's something off about it, something unsettling. i feel dissociated by these welcomes, like i've been pulled back here because i've done something wrong, something i can't quite put my finger on. it's strange to be in this place again, doing things i once did without a second thought. it feels familiar, but also foreign, like i don't belong here anymore. i keep wondering if i missed something, if i did something wrong, if all of this—this emptiness, this disconnect—is somehow my fault. the thought lingers, heavy in the back of my mind, like a question i can't answer but can't stop asking.

the music means so much more to me now. it speaks in ways i never paid attention to before. it's like you gave me a warning, a foreshadowing i couldn't hear then. you planted those seeds, and now, i remember the songs we shared—the ones i used to listen to without thinking deeper. now, they tell me everything. they hold meanings i was too blind to see, messages i should have heard before but didn't. it's like each note carries the weight of everything unsaid, the beauty of your subtleties and unspoken truth. it's as though i can hear the echoes of your soul in every song, the way our hearts are quietly pierced through by something from the melody of our past, leaving a wound that never fully heals—a cut that always bleeds.

i didn't pay attention to the lyrics back then, the subtle words you left me, the quiet signs you showed me. you were tired, weren't you? you told me more than i ever realized—through your words, through your actions, through everything. but i only focused on the beat, on the sound, on the noise. i was so caught up in my emotions, my insecurities, and my own self-centeredness. i didn't see what you were trying to say, not fully. and now, those lyrics have become truths i can't ignore. they haunt with your pain, your weariness, and the love you tried so hard to hold on. it's a love that i only now realize was never truly mine to claim, yet it was a gift i could have treasured. and in my ignorance, they all faded away.

sometimes, i sit and wonder what it must have felt like for you—to carry that weight alone, to leave quiet signs in the hope that i'd notice, only to see me stumble blindly past them. now, carrying the heavy longing in my arms, i feel the weight of everything i didn't see, everything i didn't understand. it feels heavier than i ever thought possible, pressing down on me with the realization of what you must have endured. i didn't know that i had it all, and nobody warned me before the fall. and i'm wasted. i wish you didn't leave, i just needed a wake-up call. and now i'm facing the greatest loss of them all.

but trying to see from both perspectives, i understand the gravity of everything. i realize how beautiful things were, how beautiful they could've been, for both of us. the moments we shared, the connection we had, everything—so much of it was real. but it feels like too much time has passed. too much has been lost for it to ever be what it should have been.

what if i had understood then, had seen the depth of your silent struggles? could i have done something differently? could i have spared myself from this weight of regret? it's a question i will never know the answer to, a path that has disappeared behind me, a place lost in time—where i once saw you, where you, my loved one, stayed. to a place i can no longer go back to.

and i just find myself crying without warning—no reason, just tears. it's the music. the songs we both listened to, or the ones you played. i can't help it—they pull me back, tugging at threads i thought i had buried. they bring up everything: the memories, the moments, the pain, the love. each note feels like a doorway, opening to a place where i still thought there was time, where we still believed that what we had could last. it's like the music keeps us alive, even when you're not here anymore. and in some moments, i think of you when i am sad and down, when the silence makes me cry, when it's hard to try, and all i can do is simply fall back into you. those songs remind me of the pieces of us still scattered in the corners of my heart, and i can't help but let myself be pulled into them, pulled back to you.

i've placed so many emotions in the lyrics of the songs we listened to, each one wrapped in memories that refuses to fade. the regret, the longing, the guilt—they all live in those songs now, stitched into every melody. they've become a part of me, just as you are. and when i hear them, it feels like i'm hearing you again, like your voice is hiding between the chords, calling me back to something i'll never touch again. a glimpse of us—not the us we are now, the one distant and separated by time. the us from before, when everything felt possible. when everything felt more safer, and the world was full of promise, and we could pretend that nothing could ever tear us apart. that version of us feels more closer when the music plays, as if i could be there again, if only i could reach far enough, but the distance between now and then is too vast, too final. the past, once vivid, is fading into a place i can't revisit, a place where you still held my hand and we still believed in something worthwhile. a place where no storm could break us, that time would be kind to us. but now, all that's left are fragments, memories wrapped in a melancholic tone that plays on, reminding me of who we were—of who i thought we'd always be. and every note brings me back, just for a moment, before reality pulls me further away, leaving me with nothing but the silence after the song ends.

i wish i could go back, even for just a moment, to hear you sing those songs again, to feel the way your voice carried emotions i never fully understood—how every note told a story, every lyric a piece of your soul. we were doing nothing, yet it felt like everything, as if our souls were trying to speak to each other without a single word. i long to see us again, together, lost in the music, wrapped in the warmth of the moment, before everything began to slip away.

i cherish what we had, even though it hurts, and the weight of it sometimes feels unbearable. i relive the good moments over and over, clinging to them like lifelines, but they only make the ache sharper. i fight the guilt that always seems to follow me—the regret of what i did, what i didn't do, and all the ways i fell short. it's a battle i'm slowly losing, as if every memory chips away at me, piece by piece.

i hate myself for how it ended. i hate myself for the words left unsaid and the ones i shouldn't have spoken. for the times i let you down when all i wanted was to hold us together. i miss you so much that some days it feels impossible to breathe, like the world is caving in around me. knowing i can't turn back time, that i can't rewrite what's already written.

every tear i shed feels like a reminder of what i've lost, of the emptiness that's taking place. and every time i cry, i wonder if it will ever stop— …",0

i have your old phone number. you know, the one you had 15 years ago? i know this because when i first got my phone i recieved a few phone calls from relatives of yours looking for you. after about a year those calls stopped, and we live our seperate lives like good people for over 15 years.

however, this last year, you have aparently been using your old (now my) number to sign up for every goddamn spam site and e-mail on the internet.

i get almost a hundred texts a day, with offerings of new vision insurance, local singles, and a bigger penis.

my phone goes off at least once every half hour with spoofed calls trying to renew a warrenty on a truck i don't have, or refinance a vacation house i don't own.

i know it's you because every message has the same template:

darrell! have you heard about our scam product? it'll change your life. visit us at www.scamwebsitehere.fu for more information.

amazingly good news!!!!!!

a chicago hospital that tested antibodies found 30 percent of those tested had antibodies.

https://chicagocitywire.com/stories/530092711-roseland-hospital-phlebotomist-30-of-those-tested-have-coronavirus-antibody

magnifying this percentage to the entire usa population, that would mean the death rate for the virus is 0.015 percent, about on par with the seasonal flu.

some really good news regarding asymptomatic spread! 

per wuhan health commission, the 300 asymptomatic carrier identified by large scale pcr testing between 15/05/2020 and 01/06/2020 have had their saliva and throat swab sample taken, and these samples have undergone isolation and incubation experiment at chinese academy of science wuhan. all samples have failed to result in incubation of live virus.

experts believe the negative result of incubation experiments with the saliva and throat swab sample point at either minuscule viral load, or non-viable viral fragments unable to cause infection. furthermore, samples from toothbrush, drinking cups, masks, towels and other personal effects have been taken from the 300 asymptomatic carriers, all have tested negative. on top of this, 1174 close contacts of the 300 asymptomatic carriers identified have all tested negative on pcr tests. all of these point at the conclusion that the asymptomatic carriers discovered in wuhan are not infectious.

post_06026,"i am usually pretty libertarian, but after this event i have realized that no one deserves to have their life ruined. my husband recently broke a bone and had to have surgery to have it repaired. the surgery was necessary for him to use his dominant hand/arm.

the billed amount was *56k* can you believe that?! neither of us have surgery before and had no idea that medical care at a hospital was so expensive. 

i have always wondered why people complain about the cost of medical care and i now understand. you see, we have really great heath insurance and all we paid was a $100 copay for his procedure. i used to be pretty against universal heath insurance, because it would actually be more expensive than our current premiums. we are upper middle class and we can get out of touch by being in our bubble. 

after this event occurred, i have now realized that my opinion on universal health insurance came from a place of privilege. no one in the whole world should have to worry about the cost of necessary medical care. had we not been able to afford to have my husbands bone fixed, he his life would have been changed forever. it makes me cry to know that people have to make these types of choices every day. i am humbled and ashamed to have been so inhuman. i have decided that i do not care how much more i have to pay in taxes, everyone should have access to health care regardless of economic status. no one deserves to have their life ruined.",0
post_00315,people don't care about men's mental health. i'm 19 for context. my whole life has been people telling me to man up. to take responsibility. nobody cares about me and the reason why because i'm a man. nobody cares how you feel. and at this point i don't either. now they will be forced to. just like i'm forced into this corner with no way out but suicide. always was terrible at anything i've tried so it's not like i'm missing out on my future.,0
post_06477,"my foster mom wants to adopt my siblings and i!!! my siblings (11f, 9f, 6m, 4m)and i (13m) are in the foster care system for 3 years, after being separated for one year, our foster mom agreed to take the 5 of us together. it's two years we are in her care, she finally asked my siblings and i if we wanted to make it official and that we become a real family!

i'm really delighted, i really love my mom and so do my siblings, we've been really happy with her. at first i didn't want to only have a mother, i wanted a father figure because i have never had one and i thought she was too young to be my mom (26) so i thought it wouldn't work. i'm happy that i was wrong because she's the best mom ever. it's still kinda weird that we only have a 13 years gap but it doesn't matter at the end of the day i think.

at first i hated it there because there were rules and chores, i was a stubborn, i hated my sisters because they loved her from the start also i thought she could never love us like her own kids. but then i started to love her, i love my life there and now i never want to leave.

edit: thank you everybody. i didn't expect so many of you to read my post and be happy for me and my family. thank you for your support ❤️",0
post_06615,"to the one who loves her next she'll make you pancakes on a sunday morning and she'll kiss you and tell you ""i love you, honey"" while serving them to you. tell her these are the best pancakes you've ever eaten.

she's terrified of spiders but she can open jars by herself. kill the spiders and still open the jars for her. she appreciates your help.

she gets overly excited about the little things - a flying butterfly, a fluffy cloud, a sunflower field, or a ladybug that landed on her finger. just stop and look at her smile at that time - it's precious.

sometimes she needs reassurance. tell her you love her and mean it. remind her how amazing she is. if you can't do that, leave. she deserves more than that.

her favorite flowers are orange roses. make sure she always has them. every time she looks at them her eyes sparkle and she smiles.

she loves dancing. turn on some music, slow dance with her in the kitchen and stroke her hair. she will lay her head on your chest because she's so peaceful and happy at this moment.

there will be nights when she goes out and drinks a little too much. she'll call you to bring her home. when you do, she'll try to keep you up all night by tickling you and repeating ""i love you and i'm sorry i'm annoying."" she's not annoying. but make sure she has plenty of water and don't let her pass out until she drinks it, or she will be miserable in the morning.

she is the most independent woman i know. but sometimes she's insecure, it still breaks my heart. so when she starts an argument with ""you don't love me."" do not get upset. remind her you do and the reasons why. she'll come around.

make her tea and remember the way she takes her coffee - 2 tsp of sugar and a little bit of milk. she will notice.

as carefree and loving as she is, there are parts of her life that aren't as perfect. in due time, she'll tell you every secret. she'll tell you exactly why she is the person she is. when she tells you her deepest secrets, i promise you'll love her more. hold her, and don't let her go. among the things i loved most about her, was her strength. she has the ability to get through some of the hardest things, life throws her way.

she'll make you the man you want to be. she'll make you want to be someone worthy of standing next to her.

if you cannot treat her like royalty, let someone else. that girl deserves the world.

losing her is a pain you will never shake. your world will come crashing down on you and those pieces won't ever fit the way they used to. don't let her go.

she will love you with all she's got. please give her the same.

i am begging you to not hurt her. she is golden. don't let that shine die out.

love her as much as she loves you. you will never have to ask the universe for anything ever again.

girls like her are unbelievably hard to find once in a lifetime, let alone twice.

trust me when i say this, of greater regrets you have in life is letting her go.

post_02936,"told my parents i struggle with anxiety. 24 f from india here. i have always been an anxious child. i could hide it pretty well but in the last year of college, i failed my exam and had a back log.when i went back to redo the semester, my classmate m*lested me. it destroyed my little confidence and trust in myself. for almost 1.5 years i sat at home with the most paralyzing anxiety i have ever experienced.

i used to feel naseous from the moment i wake up to the moment i go to bed. i couldnt sleep at night and felt like a rubber band was on my head giving me a constant headache that would sometimes turn into migraines. i couldn't eat dry food because i had no saliva in my mouth. i would sweat in the air conditioning. 
i knew what was happening but i couldn't ask for help. i thought i could get over it by myself.

things started going downhill after that. i would start getting scared of eating food, meeting people and worst of all, my career. i could feel the room spinning sometimes. i was so distressed. 

my parents thought i was lazy. that i had no ambition. they would scream and tease me in public. they would make me feel so worthless by telling me that i have failed. they would talk over me when i try to explain that i can't control my shaking. they would berate me for not being more social. i have very hypercritical parents. it's like salt on the wound i'd say. 

my mom was on her usual rant of how everyone has surpassed me in life and i broke down in that little auto in bangalore near commercial street. she laughed when i told her what i was sure it had become. crippling anxiety. she promised to get me a counselor and yesterday i met her for the first time. 

i just want to apologize to myself. i myself thought that i was just seeking attention. i would say the cruelest things to myself hoping i would get over it. one look at me and the counselor understood. i couldnt speak in full sentences. i said half sentences and gave her the bare minimum details. i would start crying everytime i wanted to speak. my mom was also there for the session and my mom went on her rant again about how sheer willpower and constant nagging is the solution to get over my fear.

the counselor explained what anxiety was and how it's hard to understand when you don't have it. she was kind but firm. we made a plan on how i can go back into the world. she validated me. she explained the nausea. the stomach pain. the feeling of how the whole world is suffocating you. the chest pain. everything. 

i judged myself far before anyone else did. i never stopped living but the constant battle in my head to even drink a glass of water had taken it's toll. i was mentally exhausted. i'm gonna give myself some compassion now. 24 is a good age to start.

what started as failing an exam had ended up with me afraid to leave my home. i wrote all this to say that anxiety is real. i am not sure about the road ahead but atleast now i won't ignore my bodies cry for help. ",0

for example, you can search things like ""rain city background"" or ""medieval town ambiance"" or ""crackling fireplace and rain background"", a lot of youtubers have uploaded thousands of videos that you can just leave playing in the background.  last night i slept to an international space station ambient video.

post_02447,"there is no way out look. there's nothing. i'm 24. i dropped out of college with a 1.9 gpa and ten credits left of my degree as a sixth year senior. i had been stalked, abused, lost people important to me, my mental health was in the gutter. i ended up in a mental hospital after my last semester. i have 30k in debt and my dad has three times that when you consider interest in his name via parent plus loans for me. i ruined my life, but now i've ruined my parents too. there's no idea right now if they can buy their house. i'm a burden on my dad and stepmom, and my mom hates me and everything i've become. i have no degree, no way to survive. i can't breathe. 

the only way out of this is to kill myself. to lessen the burden. if i'm gone, they don't have to feed to house me. if i'm gone, there's one less thing on their plates. they'll be sad. i know that. but they'll move on and my adopted siblings can fill that hole of child for them. and they can donit better, without their mountains and mountains of debt that is slowly swallowing their entire family. i should've gone through with it last year. i shouldn't have called for help. 

there's nothing i can do. i think this is just a rant and i'm too much of a fucking coward to actually do anything, to make anything easier on everyone because all i am is a burden. just an awful burden. ",1

post_03472,"any other ways to reduce anxiety... i need to get sinus surgery at some point as my symptoms bother me every day now. 


however out of 2 options i havent yet decided on the type of surgery to get. i have cancelled twice out of fear.  it ruminates on my mind everyday

i have had 2 nightmares so far about it so far. in one i turned up and they put like a black balaclava on my head in the theatre and i quickly ran away lol. 


my issue is anxiety, my brain is crazy. i had a fainting epsiode a few years ago and developed severe anxiety for a year after it (requiring long time off work) afraid to leave the house in case it happened again. obviously i knew there was no harm but this is just an example.  i am very neurotic and sick of myself. sometimes even though im calm i feel i am not getting enough air despite all physical signs being normal. 


i have had cbt/counselling etc but im still like i am. 


funnily enough everyone at my old workplace commented on how laid back and carefree i was. 


i don't want to label myself as some oddball and make excuses as i know that many people have anxiety and have to get on with stuff. i had a good 10 years of feeling confident where i built a career, did sports and worked on hospital wards all through covid. then after a simple fainting episode health anxiety hit the roof for some reason  

i guess i want to know  has anyone had anything similar and are there any other ways to reduce it all..",0

post_03742,"seeking help/advice across reddit (content warning for existential dread, etc.) i'm posting this on a burner, because i don't really ever want my girlfriend to find this and see how much i'm really struggling. my best friend in the world was my grandmother and she passed away several years ago now - she's who i always went to for advice and she's gone, so i'm turning to this reddit now. i've never posted on reddit before, so i hope i'm doing this right. 

i'm not really looking for a ""see your therapist,"" i'm looking for genuine perspective. this is also sort of a vent post, so if you don't want to read that scroll on. i'm just kind of looking for help from people who are older than me and have lived to see more than i have. 

i think at this rate i'm giving myself heart problems due to the amount of stress i've put myself under, and i'm just kind of scared. i'd like to preface this (as i mention a few times later as well), by saying i'm not su*cidal and i am safe. i have mental health issues (anxiety, adhd, autism) that are managed with a combination of therapy and medication. 


some background: i'm 26, going on 27. i'm from the us. i have a relatively stable job that i've been at for about 4 years. in a few months i'm finally moving in with my partner of 3 years. i should be relatively happy, but i'm not. 

i'm in a constant feeling of existential dread, and i don't really know what to do. people tell me not to watch the news, because it just scares me, but i feel like if i don't, i won't be informed, and that just scares me more. everyday, i watch the president slowly close in on making our country more facist. it scares me so bad. i've tried to disconnect from politics, but it's not something i can really do either. i feel like any day, everything is just going to close in on me, and my life is going to end - and that's terrifying to me. 

i'm scared of the world ending. i'm scared we're going to go to war. i'm scared of climate change. should i run to canada? i don't feel safe. even as i'm typing this my heart is racing. 

i've been in therapy for several months now and i've found some coping mechanisms that seem to work - but i always end up back here. at this rate, i'm going to end up with heart problems, or gray here, by the end of the year. i just feel so hopeless. 

i am trying to find the right words to describe how i'm feeling. is this a midlife crisis at the age of 26? i lay awake at night, most nights, until 2-3am, in just pure anxiety. i feel like i'm dying soon. i know everyone is just going to say that it's my anxiety, but i do feel that way. it's something i can't accept and that's why i just keep going over and over it again in my head. 

do i delete tiktok? shut off the social media and world around me? everyone says taking a break is what would be best for my mental health. but the idea of not knowing, is the idea of what scares me the most. i don't know what comes after ""the end."" i've been dreading it since i was a small kid. maybe it's a phobia? i don't know. i don't really know anything. 

i want to have kids with my girlfriend but i'm afraid they won't have a good life because of climate change. there are people online who say the end times are coming, but there are still people who stay on the positives. i don't know how i can trust either of them. 

i'm getting older, so are my parents. it's terrifying. i can't sleep at night knowing i'll be without them and the idea of living away from them makes it even worse.

i'm terrified of moving to a state that people are saying won't be there in a few years. i'm terrified even with the houses being built well, that we'll end up de@d under the rubble there. 

i keep thinking i'm getting better but when i'm sitting here, typing this at 3am, i don't really think i am. nothing is getting better. i'm so tired of crying and living with this feeling of dread all the time. i feel like no one gets it and just blames my anxiety for everything. 

i can't bring myself to find joy in anything, when it feels like i might not be here even a year from now, that i'll be dead. 

i'm so insignificant. there's only a few people that would even miss me if i'm gone. in the grand scheme of things, does it even matter? is this floating rock going to even be here in 10 years? what's the point of it all? why even bother keeping going on when it's all just going to end anyways?

i'm too scared to k!ll myself. i'm scared of the unknown. no matter how many studies or anything i read on it, it never makes me feel better. i've tried to educate myself with science or get into religion, but i haven't been able to be religious since i was a child.

is anyone even out there? is someone watching out for us? 

if there is, why can't they just let me stop feeling like this?

i look older, especially the last few months. i'm surprised i don't have gray hairs. i probably will by the end of this year, honestly. i know i look older because of my mental health.

it just keeps getting worse, my mental health. this stuff is weighing on me so much i feel like i can't breathe. i'm just waiting for the day i stress myself out to death, because that's where it feels like all of this is going. maybe then, when i'm de@d, i won't feel so worried and panicked all the time. 

like i said, i'm too scared of the unknown to actually k!ll myself, but i can't help but feel like i'd finally have some sort of peace. 

i'm not su!cidal, just really really tired. 

a part of me thinks that i'll d!e within the next year, and that i should start writing goodbye letters now. not with the plan to end it myself, but planning for an inevitable end i see in my head. 

but really - would it even matter anyways? 

i want to show this to my girlfriend, to my parents, to anyone who will care - but would it even matter? would knowing that i'm grappling with this when there's nothing they can do really mean anything? 

i think i'm just beyond help at this point, and maybe i'd be better in an institution. at least there i'd be safe and looked after. clearly i can't look after myself, i can't even keep my house clean. 

i don't want to pay for an institution. 

would it even matter if i'm so sure i'm going to d!e soon?

does anything matter?

do my words matter?
 
do i matter?

i don't. it's just really really hard and tiring to accept that i'm nothing but a blip in the universe. 

and i'm just really really tired.

writing out my thoughts was supposed to make me feel better, but it just made me cry more. 



i guess i'm just asking for advice at this point, to people who have lived through this. how do you find meaning? how do you cope with knowing that it could end any day? how do you live your life?

i could really use some advice, because i haven't slept in a while because these thoughts are keeping me awake.

i might post this on a few other reddits for advice. i just really need help. sorry if you see this more than once.

post_00163,"i think i'm actually going to do it soon my fiance has seemingly fallen out of love with me. i'm a severely mentally ill unemployed person with a substance abuse problem. i lost my job two years ago and it's been down hill since. i think i will finally end things soon, i'm finally coming to terms with the fact that no one really loves me, no one really cares if i'm around, or what happens to me. i've lost the last person i thought would always love me. if i had a gun, i'd already be dead. now it's just down to figuring out the method and how to do it successfully and without chance of revival. 

 i don't know why i'm typing this. nothing that can be said will change my mind or how i feel. 30 years of hell have led to this and i'm too tired to continue. it isn't worth it. i'm sorry, mainly to my pets, who will never understand. it hurts to think i'll be hurting them but i can't take this anymore. i self sabotage everything, i don't try hard enough because i have no energy or motivation, because no matter what i do to fix myself i always end up back here at square one.

 just like middle school. and high school. and college. every transition i thought things would improve. surely college will be better, i will actually succeed and graduate. nope! worthless fucking idiot, thinking you could ever amount to anything. i'm nothing and will never be anything and this is the best decision i could ever make. 

 sorry, mom. sorry, dad. i should have been a better kid. but we barely talk or see each other anyway, so i feel you will recover quickly. i hope you don't blame yourself. to my sister, i'm sorry i was never the good sister i should have been to you. we drifted apart and i regret it. i'm so fucked in the head i don't even know how to keep relationships with my family members even. what a fucking fuck up.

 and finally, to my fiance. i'm sorry i couldn't get better for you, and i'm sorry i dragged you along with me for over a decade. you wasted your 20s for me and i regret ever getting into a relationship because all i ever did was hurt you. 

 i might not do it just yet, but soon. it's decided and that's that. soon i will depart from this world. i can't wait.",1
post_06765,"i caught my fiance hooking up with my sister while i'm pregnant and tomorrow i'm exposing everything at our family gathering i have reached the edge of what i can bear. i am 28, and have been with my fiance for just over three years. we live together with my four-year-old daughter from a previous relationship. three weeks ago, i found out i am pregnant again. at first, i was overjoyed, naive enough to think we were finally creating the stable family i had always wanted. he grew distant the very next day. he ignored my excitement, started coming home late, and kept his phone glued to him at all times.

i began noticing strange calls and those discreet social media notifications that vanish too quickly. my gut told me to investigate. i almost wish i had not. he has been secretly hooking up with my older sister behind my back. she was the one i always tolerated even though she drags drama wherever she goes. she would hug me when relatives were around, pretend to be the supportive older sibling, then turn around and badmouth me to her friends. i never imagined she would crawl into my life this deeply. it felt like a slap in the face to read their messages calling me clueless for not noticing.

he told her about the pregnancy before he was honest with me about his doubts, and they joked about how stressed i would be raising another child. my sister bragged that our entire family thinks she is the more interesting and more popular sibling. meanwhile, i am just the quiet one who apparently deserves this. i do not know if they are still meeting in secret or if they just get a kick out of hurting me. my fiancé denies everything whenever i confront him, says i am hormonal, that my imagination is running wild. my sister keeps messaging me, telling me i should keep my mouth shut and stop being dramatic.

i am done hiding my anger. my mother wants me to talk it out calmly, but how do i fix something so broken i can barely breathe my fiancé thinks i will just accept this. he is counting on me being too shy or too pregnant to do anything. tomorrow, i plan to blow this up in front of the entire family. we are supposed to have a casual get-together at our parents house, ironically to celebrate my pregnancy announcement. i will gather my phone logs, the screenshots, and all those humiliating texts they sent each other. once all the relatives have settled in, i will put everything on display. no more secrets.

i might burn everything in the process. i might lose any chance of a pleasant co-parenting scenario. but i feel like i have no other way to reclaim my dignity. i have been crying nonstop for days, my nerves are shot, and all i get from my fiancé is either silent treatment or insults. my sister taunts me and acts like i am worthless. i see no reason to protect them anymore.

i do not know what happens next. maybe they will run off together. maybe they will lie or twist things around to make me look insane. my fiancé has not contributed much financially, so i worry about affording my daughter and this potential new baby on my own. yet i cannot pretend everything is normal. i have to protect whatever self-respect i have left. i am going to set my entire world on fire tomorrow. part of me feels terrified, the other part is numb. regardless, i am done letting them tiptoe around my heart. if they want my silence, they should have kept their betrayal better hidden. let everyone see exactly who they are. that is all i have left.",0
post_07570,"lost in the darkness it's like drowning in a sea of sadness, where every breath is a struggle. when i think about the future, all i see is a black hole, sucking me in with no way out. the pain is suffocating, and the weight of it all is crushing me. i try to hold on, but it feels like i'm losing myself more and more each day.  i look around me and see all the happy faces, the people living their lives, and i wonder why i can't be like them. why does happiness feel like a distant dream, a mirage that i can never reach? the loneliness eats away at me, consuming any flicker of hope that tries to surface.  i've tried therapy, medication, reaching out to friends, but the darkness always finds its way back to me. it's like a shadow that never leaves, whispering that there's no way out, that i'm destined to be trapped in this despair forever.  the thought of ending it all has become a constant companion, a tempting escape from this endless pain. the world feels cold and cruel, and i feel like an outcast, a broken soul in a society that doesn't understand the depth of my suffering.  i wish there was a simple cure, a way to make it all go away, but depression is a beast that never truly leaves. it gnaws at my will to live, stripping away any joy or light in my life.",1
post_06686,"my husband just put all of my makeup in resin and i'm seriously contemplating divorce i honestly don't know where to start. i (f27) work full time as a nurse. i'm fairly new, so i'm getting paid just enough to pay for groceries, rent, utilities ect. my husband also works but it's part time at his dad's pool cleaning business and it's more of a job that he just does so he isn't bored around the house. i'm the bread winner and i'm completely fine with that. (this matters i promise lol). i was telling my husband the other day that i wanted to buy a spinning thing from home goods or something to put my makeup in instead of the makeup bag i've had since i was like 14. so the next day while i was at work he took it upon himself to get all my makeup and put it in a circle dish and pour resin on it. when i got home i asked him why he was covering it with a towel not knowing what it was and he said it was a ""handmade version of something i've been wanting"" i was super excited as i love homemade gifts more then anything store bought. today he showed me it and i was pissed. at first i thought maybe he saved up and bought all the products i had but he quickly told me ""no, i just put all ur makeup in this"" i told him not only do i not have any makeup left, which is something i enjoy doing in the morning or at night before i leave for my shift, but that we can't really afford for me to go buy new stuff right now. he said ""oh i didn't think about that, sorry. anyway…"" and went off rambling about something else. he literally did not give a flying fuck. he doesn't understand why i'm so mad even tho i'm explained like 10 times that the 1 thing i look forward to doing before work is ruined until i save up to go buy the makeup again. i said the only way he could make it up to me is to save from his job so i can go buy the makeup and he said that's dumb and i can live without it. but that isn't the point. i feel bad i'm so upset about something so materialistic when he just wanted to make me a homemade gift. what do i do, i'm seriously contemplating divorce. it's more than the makeup, it's the audacity to do this and react this way when he's not the one who has to go buy all the stuff again. 

edit: i see a lot of people wondering why he put it in resin. he basically made me one of the spinny things i wanted but with my makeup in it so it's more ""aesthetic"" in his words. it's so sweet but i'm so upset i don't know what to feel. ",0
post_04462,"does anyone have a ""hangover"" period following a high-anxiety/stressful event? such as attending a concert, speaking in front of an audience, or anything that makes you nervous?

i used to be fine going to shows, concerts, anything. i liked it.  
but ever since my first ever panic attack i've been physically ""shaky"", even sometimes when i am not even mentally worried at the time.  
it's like my body turned into a chicken.

now when i attend an event, i sometimes feel stress symptoms.  
then after the high excitement/stress event, i sometimes get a ""hangover"" period. i feel so exhausted and sometimes hungry.  


this is when the heart palpitations sometimes kick in. i feel my wrist and it's sometimes about every 5th beat, and sometimes about every 20th beat. these heart palpitations give my chest a weird, uneasy feeling. there's this vague but strong discomfort in chest area, to the point where the thought of going to the er crosses the mind.

then i go to bed, get lots of sleep, and wake up still tired when slight anxiety-like tremors the next day. but then as that day progresses, it starts to feel a little better.

post_06004,"i (28m) kissed my daughter's friend's mom (30f) and i'm really happy about it my daughter is 6 and she met her new bff at the start of the school year. her mom is a very nice lady. they don't live far either so we have invited them over a lot. it's became a regular thing for the past 2 months to have them over every weekend, both saturday and sunday. either we take the girls out somewhere fun or we stay in watching movies, do other activities. 
i spend lots of time alone with her. we can talk for hours about anything and next thing we know time has flown by. then the butterflies in my stomach and the blushing everytime she smiled started hitting me. 

i've been a full time single dad for 3 years since my ex decided to walk out on our daughter. so dating has never been on my mind. they spent christmas eve and christmas with us which led to them staying all weekend. the girls fell asleep on the couch watching encanto and it was me and her up for another hour chatting. had a little bit of wine in me so ofc i blurt out that she looks beautiful right now. randomly, out of nowhere . in the end we kissed though so looks like it worked out for me.

my heart was racing so fast, i'm pretty sure my whole face was red as hell because it felt so warm suddenly lol. we were both smiling like total idiots. before they left earlier she kissed my cheek and man i just wanted to pull her in. it's my first kiss in years, with someone i feel really connected to. it's just been a really great weekend. very very happy ",0

post_05215,"i am tired of my wife i don't how else to say this. but i am tired of her. her indecisiveness. her not being able to think for herself. i think i am now taking care of 3 children including my wife. she doesn't speak up for herself. don't communicate. it's like what happens, happens with her. i just feel resentment towards her at this point and it's been 5 years since we have been married and i hate that i feel this. she is the mother of my kids but god what would not i do, for her to just take the reigns for one day and be top of things. i literally have to teach her basic stuff like to think and speak. i just don't get it. 

academically, she is brilliant. aced her college but when it comes to life , i just don't know. we always have the same discussions over and over again. when it comes to kids. when it comes to money. when it comes to bills. when it comes to everything. it's like her parents wired her to think that post marriage , the husband takes care of everything you just gotta sit back and produce babies. 

our second child was an accident. although i wanted to terminate, her sad face and all of our parents made me reconsider , rethink. i thought may be having two kids will make both of us more responsible and more proactive. but no it's that i am on double duty and she is the same. i am just fucking tired. to top it off, i lost my job last month.

i do not know where i am heading with this life i am just all round angry and unhappy. i feel sad when i look at my kid's faces. i wish i could do better. i wish i had a proper support system. in a crowd of my family , i just feel so alone.

sorry i am all over the place. my thoughts are jumbled. any advice to navigate is welcome. no hating on my wife please

thank you 

edit : thank you for the perspectives. i will sit and think on it. i am not planning to any drastic over this. my plan is to live for the kids until such time that something needs to be done. i am not looking at divorces. this was what was going through my mind yesterday. i am much calmer now.

post_06786,"growing up i was never allowed to have vanilla ice cream cause my father didn't like it, today i bought some and went home to eat it infront of him and now i feel so stupid. when i was growing up every weekend my family would go out to get ice cream, and i'd always ask for vanilla ice cream cause it was my favourite, my father rarely got it for me and he always got so mad at me for liking it and always screamd at me saying  ""it's just milk and we have milk at home! i'm not going to waste my money on it!"" and similar things. and instead he'd get me chocolate or any other flavour he liked. eventually i gave up and started asking for other flavours.

i always had so much hate towards my father for many reasons and this is one of them. i can't get past the fact that it was just a stupid flavour and he wouldn't have lost anything if he would've gotten it for me or let me have it and yet he choose not to for no reason other than that he didn't like it. 

he'd have the same reaction when i get it for myself or if i ate it in our house in front of him, most of the times it would get to him cussing me out and throwing stuff at me. when i got old enough to go out alone i would get it and eat it outside so he doesn't know.

now i'm twenty and i have a job and my own money and i can stand up for myself and argue back, today i bought a big tub of vanilla ice cream and went home to eat it in front of him to get him to argue with me so i argue back and make him see how stupid he was for not getting it for me.

so i get home and i start eating it in the living room and he's sitting next to me and can see me eating it. i finished the whole thing and sat there for an hour and he hasn't said a word. it's like he doesn't care anymore. 

i spent the last week thinking about doing it and thinking of what i would say and how i would argue and now it all feels useless and stupid. it's like i've been preparing for this moment since the first time he refused to get it for me. i have never felt more stupid,defeated, useless and frustrated in my whole life.

i don't know why i wrote this here but hopefully it would make me feel better. thanks for reading.

edit:  yesterday after i posted this i cried my self to sleep, and now i just woke up to an overwhelming amount of love and support and i'm so thankful for everyone here for making me feel less stupid and not alone. i'll get myself more ice cream and i'll try to enjoy it without thinking about my father.

after reading some of the replies i just now realised that probably it was never about vanilla and it was about him controlling me. also i just realised that there has been a lot of incidents in my life where he would try to control me and i have never thought that it was about controlling. i just thought that it was my father being a father and that all fathers did this.

i was thinking about other times where he was trying to control me and my choices and i remembered that when i was younger i'd go with him to get video games he'd always make me choose a different game than whatever i initially choose, he'd say thing like ""this game is made for children"" (note: at the time i probably was 10yrs old or younger so i was literally a child) or ""this game is made for girls"" and tries to convince me that i don't want it. he never forced me to get a game that i didn't want but he would try so hard to convince me. then if i got what he wanted he'd say praise me for it and says things like ""that's my smart boy"". if i didn't get what he wanted he'd get mad at me and whenever he sees me playing it he'd say "" look how bad the game is"". ""if you were smarter you would have got the game i told you to get and you'd be enjoying it much more"".",0

post_04865,"how being ""gifted"" led me toward anxiety and a feeling of stupidity i was what one would call a ""gifted"" child throughout grade school. i got straight a's, took honors and ap classes, scored highly on standardized tests, even skipped a grade. i never studied for tests or struggled with homework, i just naturally retained all the information i was taught. i loved reading, i would read at least one book each week. i never procrastinated and genuinely enjoyed going to school.

all those years of performing so highly in grade school led to me and the people around me having very high expectations for my academic performance. unfortunately for me, i found it harder and harder to meet those expectations throughout college. no matter how hard i try, i am completely unable to retain any information i learn, which frightens me because unlike grade school, this is information that will actually be pertinent to my future career. i end up procrastinating until the last minute to study or complete assignments because i am afraid of performing poorly. whenever i try to read, it can't keep my attention. i recently took a standardized test, and i just performed ""below average to average"". all of those ""gifted"" attributes from my childhood just kind of... disappeared.

now that i am graduating, i'm really scared for my future. i want to go into the sciences, it interests me and i care about it a lot... i'm just afraid that i'm not good enough. that i'm too stupid now. that i can't keep maintaining this image of high-performance and intelligence. i'm so afraid to try new things like research because i am afraid that i am going to fail and look stupid.

i feel like being raised as ""gifted"" has caused me to feel extremely anxious and stupid now that i am in the ""real world"". i'm curious if there is anyone else in this community that experienced a ""gifted"" childhood, or high childhood expectations, and now suffers from anxiety? how have you personally dealt with this kind of struggle? are the people around you supportive, or do they still hold extremely high expectations for you?",0

- develop a consistent sleep schedule / routine 
- incorporating exercise into routine 
- drinking herbal teas before bed 
- using a weighted blanket
- reading  
- journaling 
- listening to podcasts (some are also dedicated to helping you fall asleep!)
- watching / having something on something in the background until you fall asleep
- alternatively, limiting screen time (phone or television) before bed 
- diffusing essential oils / spraying pillow before bed
- youtube videos of distant sounds or ambient sounds
- asmr videos
- taking melatonin or calm (magnesium citrate) before bed
- yoga and meditation in combination or separately 
- self-care routine before bed 
- dedicating ""worry time"" and trying to talk yourself out of the anxious thought spiral early on
- trying to dedicate your bed for sleep, rather than hanging out there when you aren't sleepy 
- taking cbd before bed
- limiting caffeine and alcohol

post_01587,"suicide is inevitable for me i've been suicidal from a very young age, so i can't really relate to anyone else now. i don't understand how anyone functions and lives their life without killing themselves. it's difficult for me to even imagine.

having attempted it once, it didn't make me want to die any less, either. i just feel bad that i failed. i was a coward and didn't push through the fear of pain to let it end me. i'm not afraid to die, but it feels so different when you try. every time i think back to that day, i wish that i died. it makes me realize that all the time i spent being alive since then has been worthless. i'm wasting time putting off the inevitable.

i can't stop myself from wanting to die. that feeling never goes away, so how could i handle having to live with it any longer? i know i'm supposed to just bear it, but i really can't handle it... i feel so alone. i had to endure it all my life on my own, and i really tried my best. i tried to help myself and learn how to live with it, but i just can't. i don't have anyone else to blame but myself, i'm not sure what's wrong with me. i tried getting professionally assessed once, but after being dismissed by the doctors and family alike, i don't want to try again. i don't want help. i don't believe anything could fix me. 

i hope i could be understood that i won't be doing it just because i'm selfish. i tried my best to act normal and shield others from having to deal with these things. i'm not trying to make anyone's life difficult. i know that it's uncomfortable and hard to be around someone suicidal. 
i know it's pathetic, but at my worst moments i simply fantasize about people i like holding or comforting me to make myself feel better. i wish i could know what it feels like before i die, but i'm fine with it remaining a fantasy. it's easier to deal with those things alone, too. i'm used to it, and i know how.

i have a plan. the only thing that has been stopping me is not having a private space to execute it without being noticed. now i'm about to move out to live on my own, and i really think i won't make it to the end of this year. but that does make me happy. i'm glad i'll finally die after so long. i really am.",1

is not allowed to fucking kill itself either. 

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

tell anyone about your illness,

you're a fucking stigma. 

""we're all here to help""

until you want to fight for custody

or defend a court accusation

even if you fixed your shit, 

then the way you drank you coffee on tuesday

plus that old diagnosis

is a clear sign that you're unfit for anything. 





people will tell you \*\*talk\*\* to them

because it will make them feel better. 

everything's fine as long as you respond to 

their fucking messages. 

just a quick fucking response, 

that's all fifty fucking people are asking for. 

if you say ""i'm ok, it means you're fine. 

if you say ""i'm not feeling good"" 

they'll worry and then call another day 

to rinse, fucking wash and repeat. 








of fucking course

you'll eventually say ""i'm ok"". 

that's what they're waiting for. 

means they did their fucking job. 

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

of course you'll fucking lie to get people off your back. 

the clearest sign that you are over your mental illness

is obviously that you don't talk about it any more.






edit 2: 
marginally better.  

this was a really bad episode, so i thank all of those who responded supportively. unsupportive, combative comments won't be responded to in the same way i did earlier, but i implore those commenters to respect that normal rules of conversation do not apply here going forward.
you are dealing with unwell human beings, please don't try to ""win"", or ""just say"". this is not about entertaining you. if you feel you might be unhelpful, please just observe, instead of commenting. thanks. 

edit:

**read before commenting**

this is a suicide note. don't tell me whether or not you agree or disagree. 

to all the idiots trying to analyse this fucking suicide note - stop. idgaf if it doesn't apply to you. i was never fucking pregnant - nor did i kill anyone else or try to. nor am i fucking american. 

the whole fucking point is that the way the world is fucking set up no one will fucking allow you to die, whether you deserve to, want to, or need to. generally. idgaf of your country or fucking town is an exception. all i want is to say a fucking goodbye to people i love and not be fucking ""saved"". 

life has to be dragged on in this hell, no mattwr fucking what - and just because other people want it to be. 

if a person is bad like me, they still have to keep living. there's no support or at least an ok to fucking kill myself. 

i was fucking cut down when i was hanging, and that's supposed to be a fucking victory.

but i'm still fucking here suffering because other fucking people thinl i should for them. 

and i didn't fucking ask to be born. 

this is fucking suicide watch, it's a fucking suicide note.",1

post_05060,"i hate my friend im a 18yr old girl, and hes an 18yr old boy (gay) 
we have been friends since we were like 14, but we werent really close until recently like this year?
since then he's been more open with his feelings and venting and stuff. but its just that, when he vents, i genuinely try to give him good advice but he just doesnt listen at all. like it goes in one ear and right out the other. and then he comes back a few days later venting to me abt stuff that could have easily been avoided/fixed if he cared to listen to me. but the thing is he gets really mad at me for being ""useless"" and having shit advice. 
countless times, more than 30 times i have stayed up until like 5am talking to him, listening to his vents and making sure he doesnt feel alone. (he has no other friends except me and has no partner)
but like i feel like, im only doing this bc i feel bad he has no one else to talk to..like if i stop being friends with him he literally might commit suicide.
whenever i talk about my feelings, he always somehow makes it about himself like ""yeah but i have it worse blah blah"" or goes like ""oh just try harder lmao"" or sumn 
i've also heard from other people that he talks shit abt me with them so i genuinely dont know what he wants from me.
also, i have a partner who i would really love to spend more time with, but this friend gets reallyyy mad that i never spend time with him (i do?) and gets so jealous and insults my boyfriend to try make me feel bad?? like...
i feel so guilty typing this but this is genuinely making me lose sleep and time. idk what to do. i confronted him 2 or 3 times about it but he keeps brushing it off or somehow guilt trips me like ""but.. were friends! are you gonna let me kms?"" or something damn

post_01814,"suicidal thoughts after quitting 18 years of drinking not sure if this will be a throwaway account or not

i had a reasonably dysfunctional adolescence and young adulthood. was oppressed and depressed. looking back, both my parents had un-diagnosed mental disorders as did both my siblings. my father was eventually diagnosed bi-polar. i had one suicide attempt at 15 that was a close call. i later joined the military and had one more close call with a firearm and another full attempt with pills. 

around this time i started drinking heavily. the underlying depression stayed but acute thoughts of suicide went away. i also had some messed up experiences in the military, so, i continued drinking until a couple months ago. complications of drinking almost killed me and i ended up in the hospital. i quit drinking but suicidal thoughts appeared immediately after i detoxed.  it's been going in waves of a couple hours or a day or two at a time. not just hopelessness but deep nihilism. such as feelings of, ""humanity is doomed"", ""we have maybe 5 years left, tops"". i have not felt this way before and i don't know what to do.",1

post_06624,"so, i just started reading a book to my girlfriend... my (long distance) girlfriend has always liked going to sleep to the sound of my voice. every night, even when she's about ready to collapse from exhaustion, she'll call me up, crawl in bed, set up her camera so we can see each other, and wait for me to start talking. she says it's comforting and that she doesn't like being/feeling alone when she drifts off. i don't mind, she's so sweet and watching her slowly fall asleep is the goddamn cutest thing ever. 

and so, for the past year, i've tried a lot of different things; sometimes i'll make up a story as i go, other times i'll just tell her about my day or what's on my mind. you name it, i've probably done it. recently however, she told me that she wanted me to read her a story. i can't believe i didn't ever think of that! of course i said yes, i even drove all the way to her place to pick up a book of her choosing from her sizable collection.

last night we started reading the tale of despereaux together and i've never been more happy. it's small things like this that remind me of how much i love her. she relished every second of it; sometimes she'd ask me to give certain characters goofy voices, other times she'd sit there in a tense silence waiting to hear what happened next as i flipped the page. in the end, when she was only about half awake and only occasionally murmuring, i whispered my normal good night.

""good night, i love you so much!! have good dreams and a nice day tomorrow, i'll talk to you later.""

after barely managing to mumble out the sweetest ""i love you to,"" i've ever heard she went to sleep. it was so perfect, it was as if we were living out a charming love story of our own. now all i can think about is tomorrow night, i just want to spend more time with her. i want to hear her giggle at my bad french accent, i want to see the particular face she makes when a character she doesn't like does something, most of all i just want her to wake up so i can tell her how much i love her. she really is a blessing, i'm lucky to have someone so kind and pure.

tl;dr: my girlfriend wanted me to read a book to her, it went very well. i love her to bits.

edit: i took a brief nap and damn did i reach a helluva lot of people. thanks for all the lovely vibes, recommendations, and even my first ever reddit gold this'll only make our story time that little bit sweeter when we do it again tonight. i'm glad this post was able to touch so many people; love is contagious and anything i can do to spread it around a little bit is good by me. love y'all so much!!",0
post_00643,lonely  hello. i don't know if this will be my last post. i'm having trouble living. i have severe ocd and believe in solipsism. i believe i am the only person here on earth and everyone else is not real. i have been feeling like this for awhile now. i can't live like this anymore. the more i think about it the more i prove myself right. i feel like i am the only one that feels pain and feels my body sensations but when seeing others i can't feel that therefore i have to be the only one on this earth. i'm the only one that sees in first person which bothers me. this is torture. i don't understand what i did to deserve this. if there is anyone out there that feels the same way even tho i do feel like no one is real i guess if maybe just maybe seeing others relate can help me believe because im tired. i'm 22 but i just don't want to keep going in this lonely world.,1

post_03475,"anxiety around eating dinner/eating out (tw: eating disorders/gi disorders) several month ago my gi issues that i have had for nearly 20 years increased along with stress related to work for the past 4 years (too many requests not enough time to get everything done perfectly). at first i thought it must be a recurrence of my gi issues that were dormant for 10+ years. then i began to connect the dots that a huge project was kicking off and more was just coming down the pipeline at work around the time my gi symptoms reappeared. 

over the next few months i had 2 really bad incidents where i had to tell my partner we needed to leave the restaurant we were at because i was having a bad gi flare (nausea, lower gi cramping, and other unpleasant symptoms that remain nameless to protect the innocent). these all resolved each time i returned home and took pepto-bismol. so, i was not ill with a virus or food poisoning etc. after my gi issues reappeared, i did follow with my primary care provider and also a gi specialist at a major medical center 3 times. both have been helpful. however, with the high stress and the resurgence of my gi issues, i am beginning to think that perhaps i was developing an anxiety loop of ""well if i eat this will it make me sick?"" nonetheless, i soldiered on and my lower gi symptoms go better, but around october i began to experience stomachaches around dinnertime every day and lost my appetite for the most part. i unconsciously just didn't eat enough at dinner and subsequently lost 15 pounds when i randomly decided to weight myself in mid-december because my clothes were fitting looser. the 15 pounds of unintentional weightloos freaked me out. so, i contacted my gi doc thinking that there might be more than just feeling a little anxious about eating dinner. 

i was tested for a few things that my gi doc thought it might be, and we also discussed my stressful work and that i was going to be transitioning to a new position in mid-february. so, his thought was, lets have you see a gi dietitian and wait and see if your stress levels decrease. in the interim, he asked me to try and track my instake which i was doing anyways and aim for 1800 calories per day using ensure plus to supplement as needed. i am usually hitting around 1800 per day and have not lost more weight. 

this is where it gets weird for me, since december or so, i have noted that i no longer desire to go out to eat in restauants or in front of others for fear of if something might make me feel unwell. just last week i cut my lunch at work short because i was so anxious with all the other people in the break room with me that i had to leave and again talk myself off of a ledge (i was hot, stomach was doing flip flops, and i felt like i as cramming food down my throat even though i did not eat that much).  over the weekend while going on an overnight trip to visit friends, i had what i would call a bad anxiety attack in a restauant at dinner. i had to excuse myself and go to the restroom to use the facilities because i was so anxious and talk myself off the ledge before i could eat barely half of the sandwich i had orderd (it was good too!!). 

i'm at a point where i am seriously worried that this will escalate further and then what? i have not seeked professional help with the anxiety aspect at this time, but i am seriously thinking that i may need that kind of assistance, and i should reach out for a referral from my medical team as this is just insane. the logical side of my mind is like this is not difficult and what is wrong with you, you need to eat and the emotional side of me seems to be locked into if you eat dinner you're going to be unwell and you're going to embarass yourself having to leave a restaurant early. it is so frusterating since eating out was a huge part of my life for a long time and i feel like i have lost that part.

post_05303,"today i sat on what amounted to a ""death panel"" i live in the northeast us and the weather has been pretty bad. i hear it has been all over but i don't really pay attention to the weather outside of my immediate vicinity and natural disasters. 

anyway, i work with the homeless in my area and the local government gave a couple local agencies money to get unhoused folks who were currently staying *outside* outside into a hotel while it's really bad. i guess when the county might have been covered in peoplesicles their attention was finally turned, albeit briefly, towards the very serious problem of homelessness happening all over the country and worse here than a lot of other places.

we're starting to run out of said money though and today i was part of a meeting of about ten people who got to decide who was getting the boot.

i fucking hated it. this kind of thing was not what i signed up for.

i am a lowly peon but i did manage to speak up for a couple people. a couple who have been homeless for a very long time and are about to be housed. another couple with a child under 10, which i took particular offense to. a *very* old man. couple others. but it was politics, if i tried to get everyone it would water down the weight of what i have to say and you can't do that when you actually want to help people cause that's when you're not taken seriously which is necessary for when it matters most. i hold a certain amount of respect and my clients need it stay that way. it's fucking dirty.

this was of course on a day when a ton of other shit happened that i won't get in to.

i don't know how i took today as calmly as i did and i'm a little curious about it. i know it's not numbness, i was complimented on both my passion for the work and compassion today, but everything is/was on fire and it should have been more demoralizing than it was by any normal standard.

reading this you would be right to assume that i'm the kind of person who cries, but you'd be mistaken, i don't, not ever. it's frankly unhealthy, but my boss said something to me a couple weeks ago when some shit went down that i think might be an echo of today. i asked ""why am i not more upset by this?""

post_04978,"i'm probably going to sabotage this friendship i've (32f) been best friends with this guy since day 1 at work. actually two guys, one of whom has always been in a relationship and this one who in the last 11 years hasn't. and we 3 were great friends as a group and also individually. 

now this guy has a new girl he's dating. it's new and exciting and i want to like the girl. i have a great equation with all best friends or spouses of my best friends (male or female). but i cannot get myself to like her. 

i can't put it down to if it's because:
1. he's given me her backstory and what gave me pause was shortly after her divorce, she hooked up with multiple people never actually taking the time to be single and introspect. which is fine if it's her style but i feel like she got into this relationship the same way as the others 

2. i tried to get to know her when we met twice, telling her stories about me, or about the to guy back in the day and i always got a response: oh i know, he told me. i can't tell if this was her way of building camaraderie or shutting me down, or positioning herself as someone who knows everything about him. 

3. i have a hypothesis it's cause we two were the only last single people in our friend circle, so while i can be very sure i do not like this friend romantically (we have different ideas about the future, have talked about this many years ago and mutually agreed being friends was the right way to go for us as we were both emotionally very attached to each other on a best friend level, and most importantly i'm not attracted to them). maybe it's because the group dynamics have changed and while i never felt single in the past because this friend was always there, now they have a girlfriend too and i'm still mentally, watching them do the same cringey couple things we spent years laughing at. 

4. i have a bad feeling in the gut. i'm decent at judging intuitively and i feel very restless when i'm around them. i can't point out why but i just do. .. 


i'm now leaving the country soon and want to spend the last 2 months being happy and not stressed, and i feel like maybe the only way to do that is take some time away from this best friend, and do my own things. which makes me sad as i would have loved to have made some going away memories with them, but their girl friend will now always be a part of the group. i don't know if i feel replaced, if i feel alone or if i feel jealous but whatever it is, i might end up sabotaging a 11 year amazingly great friendship because of a gut feeling. and i obviously won't ever tell my friend that.

post_03466,"anxiety flaring up during pms i'd appreciate women sharing their experiences and giving any tips or advice on this. if any gynecologist is out there who can tell me if it's normal, i'd really appreciate it.

i experience anxiety here and there, but sometimes it gets really bad during my cycle, i have clammy hands all day, random tremors, and palpitations. if you go through this, you'd understand that it can be really overwhelming on top of cramps and body aches. 

i have grown accustomed to random chest pains, but obviously, with all these symptoms during my cycle, it's just exhausting with added chest pains, overstimulation, rage that you feel for no reason, and tears just boiling up behind your eyes.

i'm currently sipping green tea.

post_02324,"i keep having suicidal thoughts no matter how i'm feeling that day  i keep having random thoughts of suicide that have been on and off for a while now but these past few months they have been really bad. i have had therapy for 15 years now and have tried countless antidepressants etc and i've found it's never really worked for me i feel like most of the therapist rush and i leave feeling worse without being able to have spoken to properly about how i feel and when i've told people in my life that i trusted how i've felt i've been judged and told to ""heal my trauma etc"" or i've been called a ""covert narcissist"" or an ""energy vampire"" and i just feel like it's such a horrible thing for people to say to someone who was genuinely reaching out for help i feel like i'm too messed up and reaching out made me feel even worse.

my current therapist has made me take the max dose of anti depressants and i found they made me feel just numb with the occasionally happy bursts yet the suicidal thoughts haven't gone away just so many of my feelings have its messed up. i had quite a difficult year last year i felt so alone and felt i had no one to really turn to my partner was abusive and used to drive crazy and at high speeds to scare and control me and i have so much anxiety in cars now it's insane and i get really hurt when i ask him to slow down and people judged me for it but they don't understand why.

 i ended up turning to drugs as a way to cope early last year (i've been clean now for about three months) my partner told everyone about my drug abuse and i was judged even more and even threatened everyone gave him sympathy and made him feel like a victim it made me feel even worse about myself i had a few friends turn on me because i was at my lowest so i wasn't fun to be around anymore or would be called a ""buzzkill"" or told to ""be positive"" ""stop being so sad life's not that bad etc"" and as a result of that i just turned to getting high as a way to escape i felt it was the only way to get away from the pain of life without actually taking my life.

 i ended up becoming friends with another drug abuser we were close for a while she made me feel like i finally had someone to relate to but then she started to become really close with my partner and eventually i just kind of distanced myself from her i tend to do that to people if i feel i can't trust them or if i feel betrayed and i felt betrayed because i had cried to her for months about him and i thought she could relate to me as she used to cry about her ex to me. 

 i just feel like i need so much therapy now about last year on top of everything else and i feel like i have no one to really talk to about this stuff on a deep level i feel like so many people either don't care, recommend toxic positivity or they just judge me. 

sorry this is such a long post there's so much more but i tried to keep it as short as possible. ",1
post_05736,"sexual harassed by a disgusting old man hi, i am a 26 f and i am queer, i live in south america, specifically ecuador, me and my partner went to the local hot springs, we were minding our own business and went to change into out bathing suits, we realized that there were some renovations being made to the ladies changing rooms so there was a mixed changing room, then an old american man got into the stall next to us and started breathing heavily, i was like wtf but didn't read into it too much because i figured he can't breathe cause he is old, then after enjoying the hot springs for a little bit we decided to leave cause there were too many people. 

we went into the changing room and ofc we were together in one changing room, just changing into our normal clothes so we could leave, when the old man got into the stall closest to us, (there was no one in the changing room expect us so he had lots of options) he started breathing heavily and almost moaning, i was convinced he was touching himself because his breathing was moans, i felt terrible and disgusted and urged my partner to go faster so we can leave, afterwards the old men ( there was a group of three) we sitting right in front of my locker and i had to uncomfortably walk past them to get my stuff and one of them proceeds to say ""you guys are in a hurry"" i'm sure that all of them were in on it because before they were sitting at a completely different table not even close to our lockers.

i feel completely disgusted and almost in shock still because of the situation, i don't know how to proceed or how to stop feeling like this? was this sexual harassment? has anyone ever experienced something like this? ",1

post_06780,"i got made fun of, by strangers at a party just got home, haven't felt this shitty in a long time. 

my friend asked me to go to this party with her, i was hesitant at first because i'm kinda shy and not that great socially, and i don't know anyone there, but eventually she convinced me to go with her.

when we got there i noticed it was mostly girls (i'm a girl myself), which made me feel at ease, introduced myself to everyone, and they all seemed really nice and kind. 

since all of them know each other from school they were talking about school and gossiping about people in their school. i tried to join their conversation but they litterly ignored me, looked at me and straight up ignored me, super embarrassing. so i tried to talk to the girl next to me, and she clearly didn't want to talk with me either.

so i just gave up, sitting there all quiet on my phone. eventually they went on to play drink roulette, its an app where everyone puts their name in, the thing spins, lands on a name, and that person gets a challenge or question and if they fail they'll have to drink. so the girl was putting everyones name in, and ofcourse she forgot me, so my friend told her she forgot me. then the girl said she forgot i was there because i'm so quiet, and everyone laughed. (my friend too)

during the game a phone was getting passed around with a spotify playlist and you could put the song you wanted in there, and when it was my turn, the girl next to me grabbed the phone out of my hands and said ""ill put something in there for you"". so a while later, fucking gangnam style played, and she screamed ""i put this in for her"" and everyone laughed. (i'm asian) i just laughed with them, but i felt really bad.

during the game, i got the question ""how many relationships have you been in"" so i replied 1. then my friend said ""2, if you count the e-boyfriend you met on minecraft"" i was like fucking 12 btw, but anyway they all started laughing at me again, and one of them said ""they probably fucked on minecraft too"" then they went on to talk about how people who play alot of video games are pathetic. one of the girls said ""they all live online, and they're all socially awkward in real life"" while looking directly at me.

so yeah, had a pretty horrible time. started crying when i got home, not because all the mean shit that whas said, but because my friend threw me under the bus like that.",0

i'm 22f. i was just told by my mom that i'm actually 2 years younger than what i've been told all my life so i actually turned 20 this year. i was born in a country where age fabrication/fraud is common, especially amongst people immigrating to the us. my mom said my age was changed on my birth certificate before immigrating to the us so that i could start school early. 

i just feel a mix of emotions right now. i'm upset at my mom. i feel like i don't know who i am anymore. nobody except my parents and i know my real age. i'm debating whether or not i should even tell anyone. 

this explains so much for me. i've always been a bit behind in school academically. i was also a late bloomer. 

 i feel so disgusted and weird knowing i was 12/13 in high school. i was asked to prom my freshman year by a senior and ended up losing my virginity to him. i thought i lost my v at 14 like most girls but i was 12. i can't stand the thought of that. i also started selling nudes as soon as i turned 18. it freaks me out to know that i was actually 16 in all the pics and videos. 

i feel guilty and grossed out and angry. my mom said ""think of it as gaining two extra years of life"" but it feels more like i lost two years of my youth. is it fucked up if i just keep this information to myself?

i asked her out and she gave me an enthusiastic yes!! it was exciting. it was nerve wracking. we had dinner the following night without the kids. gotta admit it did feel a little awkward. no kids there as a distraction and this was meant to be romantic. we eased into it though. then we just didn't want the night to end. after dinner we walked around her whole neighborhood just talking until it was really starting to get late. she looked so beautiful i couldn't stop looking at her. then last night with the girls was…i can't even describe how happy it made me. we agreed not to tell them about us being together for a while and no pda in front of them. so even if it was hard keeping our hands to ourselves it still felt nice making dinner, watching movies with the kids and making a comfy pillow fort. they swore they were gonna stay awake to watch the ball drop  famous last words. 

they were out before 11. 
kids asleep. then it was midnight  and we shared our first new years kiss. best night i've had. we did end up getting carried away but you know what, i don't care. it was amazing. we stayed up all night talking afterwards. chatting about everything. life, where we want things to go. it's been a long time for sure since i had an intimate conversation like that with anyone. 

we sure as hell didn't regret staying awake all night when we woke up at 7 am to the kids playing downstairs and asking for breakfast already  been a chill day today. can't stop smiling. for me this is what it's all about. happy new years everyone. i'm definitely looking forward to all the possibilities",0
post_06038,"a letter to my son you came home this weekend, visiting from college. we'd texted asking what we could get at the store for you, and you'd replied chicken in a biscuit crackers and peaches. i bought a few more things because that's what moms do. there were yogurts in the fridge, along with milk. crispex, your favorite cereal. some fruit roll ups. i forgot to tell you about the chocolate pie.

&#x200b;

we had friends over for board games saturday. they hadn't met you yet. i happily told them about how you were doing in school, and your pride in your luxurious and lengthy locks. about how you'd told me your hair was softer than mine. i had made peanut butter fingers for dessert, and told them how i'd send the rest of them back to college with you. i thought you were out visiting your friends, but then you got up from a nap, and came in to say hi, and meet our friends for the first time. we smiled and introduced you. i'm glad they met you.

&#x200b;

you didn't stay for dinner. you were snowed in last weekend when you came down to visit, and had a lot of friends you wanted to hang out with this weekend. i said something, i don't remember. was it ""cya!"" or ""have fun!""? i almost told you to text if you'd be out late, but you're 18, so i was trying to treat you like a grown up. you took the car out.

&#x200b;

you struggled the first quarter, last quarter. you failed the first math midterm, since your high school teachers had left you woefully unprepared. your math teacher had a policy though, where you could get the grade in the class of either your midterms, or of your final. you decided to learn everything you should have in high school, then started relearning everything in the book from the start. you pulled off a great grade. i was so proud of you. you bragged about being a mother fucking prodigy in your cs class (you were too old to be a prodigy at 18, but i let that slide), but i was so much more proud of what you accomplished in math than of how you did in cs.

&#x200b;

you struggled with some other things too. things you opened up about. some addictions, anxiety, depression. after your friend killed himself last summer, you got your first tattoo. it was a semicolon with a heart at the top of it. mental health awareness. you got it huge- most semicolon tattoos are tiny little things, but yours was a good three inches or more. you took my advice and had it done by a professional, rather than your friend with the tattoo gun, even though you had to wait a few more weeks. you had it before you left for college.

&#x200b;

after your friend died, we made appointments with a counselor. you told me you liked her, and that she was helping. she hadn't been taking new clients, but made an exception for you. at first i drove you to the appointments, and waited in the room outside. then you started driving yourself to them. you started seeing someone else up at college, and they gave you the medicine you needed, and we had our first bipolar diagnosis. i warned you that it can take a while and multiple tries to find the right medication.

&#x200b;

i gave you advice a lot. and i worried a lot. i told you it was my prerogative as a mom to do both. you were planning on moving out from the dorms, and i had started searching for some dump crockpot recipes to help you feed yourself. we had always talked about having me give you cooking lessons, but hadn't yet found the time. you told me about the duplex you would rent, but never sent the link. my sister and i started filling it with imaginary furniture anyway. you'd need a bed, a dresser, a couch. maybe, we didn't know if it would be furnished. you knew i worried, and once you joked that i always expected the worst things to happen. about defensive driving because of other drivers on the road. about providing your own condoms instead of using ones girls provided.

&#x200b;

i didn't worry about guns. you had promised me you would tell me if you ever felt like ending it. you told me how mad you were your friend killed himself. how mad you were he acted like everything was fine, how he said he was grabbing his headphones from the car, but instead drove off.

&#x200b;

you won't read this note. it's monday. i saw you last on saturday, going to visit your friends. according to your best friend, you had a great time. you told her your usual goodbye ""te amo"" and left to come back home. she said you even drove parallel to each other before taking your usual turn off. but instead you went to the beach. i went there for the first time 2am sunday. you'd sent her a suicide note. she called the police and had her sister drive you to our house. you wouldn't answer your phone, but she had the find my friend with your location.

&#x200b;

i got to the beach, but we weren't allowed to leave the car. it was cold out, but that wasn't why i was shivering. your friend was crying, but your father and i were just holding hands. i knew it was bad when the officer asked for the back window to be rolled down. it was to talk to us first. i couldn't find the button, someone else rolled it down.

&#x200b;

i miss you. so so much. i have the leftover peanut butter fingers, and that chocolate pie i hadn't told you about. those are only two of the many things around the house telling me about how i'll never see you again. there will be more. i had ordered some stress reliever toys from ebay. i didn't know if they'd make it in time for your care package this month, or if it would be next quarter. i ran out of time first quarter and used a preassembled amazon snack pack for first quarter care package, and i wanted to do a better job this time. your best friend told me you had liked it.

i didn't sleep yesterday. i took a benadryl last night, and woke up this morning feeling almost human. until i remembered. i've already started on the kleenex. there will be more family visiting today. they keep asking if they can do anything. there are no words i need, no tasks i need done. i don't know what to do. i can't take back any of my previous actions, my previous words. i can try and help your father know he was a good dad, the best. you won't get my future words. i never told you i was considering writing you a manual for how to live life. a little presumptuous i know, i never had it all figured out either. but, here's a letter. i love you. i tried to tell you every time i dropped you off, even in college. i love you kid.

edit: i can't tell you how much it has meant to read these replies. thank you. thank you. i may reply to more, but here's what i really wanted to say right now.

post_02179,"how to be brave with a scaredy mom ? f28 here. i'm autistic and depressed and anxious and suicidal. i sleep all the time. i plan to travel to wake my sloshy brain up, and i did and i felt so good. problem is : my mom is a helicopter mom. she's not the extreme one like in memes or youtube videos, she's a good normal mom but with helicopter parent tendencies. she wants me to have a flat in the same town as her so she can help me (but i don't want that, i want to be completely independent, she'd be clingy even when she's not there), tracked my phone during my first trip alone and kept sending messages over and over again until i got angry with her to tell her to stop. she did, but i hate having to be angry for my mom to let me be an adult.

my mom wants me to be independent, that's what she says, but it's not true, because in her behavior and the only deeply honest vulnerable things she said is ""i only have my daughter, she's all my life, what will i do without her ?"". i want to live my own life, i want to feel complete, but i can't because i fear my mom won't leave me alone.

besides, i feel like if i ever leave the house to go live or rent somewhere else like anybody else in our modern society, she'd go worse mentally and kill herself. she's also depressed and anxious af, so we're hurting each other with our paranoia and pent up anger and painful memories and anxiety and sadness. i had brothers and sisters who left home and went on their life, but they told me they had to get into a big fight and go through tears and pain before they slammed the door close behind them. now they have normal lives and get along very well with our mom, they still speak to each other irl and on the phone but i don't want to give her pain once again, she suffered so much in her life (bullying, domestic abuse, depression, social anxiety).

she's too scared for me, so i'm scared of life, and i don't want to be scared. i'm fed up with being a shrinking violet, and i know i'm usually not. i'm so angry with my mom but i want to save her at the same time. i feel like i'm going to kill her with one more bang to her pain threshold by going after the life my brothers and sisters had the privilege to get.

how do i deal with that ? how can i go live my own life on my own without hurting my mom ?",1
post_03775,"i want to give in and take my first zoloft dose tomorrow morning... i apologize if this is long. i feel like no one understands me. ive had anxiety my whole life and what my therapist believes to be anxiety induced depression. im 28 now but my first phase of this happened when i was 19 i was playing video games all day and i had just dropped out of college. i had a panic attack playing stupid league of legends and after that it went downhill. i went through a couple of months of anxiety and depression. i was hopeless. i remember forcing myself to do go out and do things and eventually i got better. but i also started drinking, i saw it as a way to have fun. fast forward to 27, i started drinking to make myself feel better. being at edc and being in the crowd and i started to get anxious and the first thing i did was go buy a beat box and down it so i can feel better 10 min later... and it would work. this is also when i knew it was starting to be a problem. self medicating with alcohol to avoid anxiety. luckily i don't have an addictive personality and i let go of alcohol since october. i never really drank every day anyways. just weekends. one day i got a panic attack driving out of town and after that, i avoided driving far because of my anxiety. i also got a panic attack at work around september and every time i had a similar situation at work i would get increased anxiety. i avoid traveling in airplanes due to my anxiety, going to the gym because my heart rate goes up and i get panicky... and now i can't even work out because my heart rate increases. even if i tell myself it's okay and that im fine it's hard to stop my body from reacting that way. i moved out with my girlfriend last year in may and she has been trying her best to be supportive but she comes from a military family and she believes in getting over it if you put your mind to it but man oh man it is easier said than done. on october 1st i started to get these brain zaps and i asked my manager if i can take some time off. i have been off since october. luckily i found a good therapist and he believes in me. he also gave me 3 months off work and im getting payed for this time off as well and i am truly blessed but if its not one thing then its the other that makes me sad and my anxiety starts kicking up. i weighed 270 in october, had high blood pressure, high cholesterol. now i weigh 235 still a lot but i weigh less, fixed my cholesterol and my high blood pressure but i still feel like this sometimes.  anyway, the first doctors i saw prescribed me xanax and i lied to them saying i didn't like the feeling. i never actually took it because of course i started looking up side effects and im terrified... he then prescribed me klonopin as well but didn't take that either and told him my dad has been on sertraline (zoloft) for years and it has been good for him. he prescribed it to me as well but i can't take it man. i try my best to not think about it and just do it but all these damn stories on reddit and just everywhere online scare the shit out of me.i have read positive stories as well and it gives me hope but it is so damn hard to convince myself to take this damn pill. i keep making excuses and pushing it off. i feel like there is always something that stops me. i started getting these heart flutters that get better when i take electrolytes, but now im like maybe i should see a cardiologist first then when i get the okay i can start taking the pill. i have a trip for my anniversary on the 14th, maybe i should start after.... i know they are excuses but i guess it's the anxiety in me just pushing it off. october and november last year were horrible. i would try seeing my family but i didn't feel safe anywhere. it was just me and my hopeless thoughts. i didn't really think of hurting myself but i would sometimes think like damn if i feel like this why am i even here. i don't want to get back to that. i could barely go to the store, i would avoid seeing my friends because i was scared to start feeling like i would get a panic attack, but i forced myself. i forced myself to go on walks and to see my family more. in october and november my anxiety and depression were at about a 9/10 now its about a 6/10 but it seems like every time i try picking myself up i always get brought down due to this anxiety and sometimes depression. sometimes i don't even know if i need the pill. but the best way i can explain it is that it's like im functioning but not how i want. ever since these flutters i don't like to be alone but i can go to the store, go to a hockey game, drive and see my family but with bouts of anxiety and depression. im getting tired of it. i need to go back to work and i want to be able to travel and want to be able to be there for my family and i still feel like i can't do that. my therapist says he believes in my ability to get back to myself without meds but he doesn't know how long it will take and if i want to do it faster that i would need to start the meds. im stuck man. i was sure everything was going to be okay a couple of weeks ago then these heart flutters started and im like here we go again. i heard they can also be caused by stress and anxiety. i don't know if i should even start the pill or keep trying to do this without it. i haven't tried as hard as i should exercising because of the way i get but i also haven't tried meditation as much as i should or journaling. i just need advice or i just want to see what you guys would do.

post_05077,"i was in the same seat for the entire duration of my girlfriend's birthday party and now i feel like shit it was my girlfriend's birthday just yesterday and she had a karaoke party with me and her friends. i know them but i have not seen/interacted with them before, except for like four people but we aren't that close either. i'm not someone that interacts a lot in general, especially towards people i'm not friends with. i also just would stick around and follow someone i know during parties/events as i dont like being left alone with people i don't know. however i couldn't exactly follow my gf around since she was busy tending to her guests and enjoying herself and i obviously didn't want her to deal with her socially awkward boyfriend for the entirety of the party, thus i spent the next three hours sitting in the same seat. scrolling on my phone, just nodding whenever people would ask me if i was okay, and occassionally my girlfriend would go to me but that would last for a couple of minutes (esp. she was getting drunk and hyper and thus went around with her friends.) i was starting to get anxious by the time went on as people started to get louder and drunker. i knew it was inevitable since it was a party and my girlfriend had told me prior that they really were that hyper and loud yet i genuinely wanted to go outside of that room (it was a private room) and cry because it was getting too much for me. i got more anxious as well since i was just sitting there and i knew i was getting perceived as someone that was just... sitting there and not even talking to anyone. i eventually started feeling guilty because i wasn't really into the party, and i didn't want to ruin my girlfriend's night because i wanted to go outside and cry (i was tearing up multiple times already.) i feel like shit because i didn't do anything, i was there in the party like some statue. i know people wanted to meet me since i was the boyfriend (which made me more anxious) but i really can't navigate social events properly and have always been shy and awkward around people. i know alcohol wouldve maybe help me loosen up a bit but i dont drink due to mental health issues and trauma. in a way i feel like a party pooper because i was the only one there sitting down in one spot, scrolling on my phone (hell i ended up answering an assignment to get my mind off stuff.) i wanted to go home so so bad... i also feel so fucking guilty because it's like i'm making it about myself. i don't really want to tell my gf (thus i'm in reddit) because i know she'd feel sad over what i went through last night but i don't want that to happen since it was her birthday. i feel incompetent and stupid. i fucking hate being introverted. i hate being socially awkward. i literally hoped for the party to end early so i could get out of that place. i have nothing against her friends i just feel anxious about stuff like these a lot.",0

i'm just constantly disassociating, doing things that disgust me. i started talking to people, meeting people, sending pictures and videos to them, sometimes they even paid for specific things. i do it. i don't care. at least it makes me feel useful. loved. desired. all those things you made me feel. 
you were my shortest relationship and i only saw you once, so why is this obsession with you slowly killing me ?

post_02331,"id kill myself for a hug im 15 years old, introvert, i have a christian family, and we live in my grandmother's house.

i have an abusive father, who i always feared ever since i was born because of how he reacts on things. it feels like he could kill me at any moment. just hearing him talk gives me goosebumbs. he beats me up for being lazy and stupid at chores while my mother just watch as these things happen.

i don't see him as a father figure to me because of what he is. he is lazier than me, he doesn't have a job and he always ask my mother for money. he wants me to work, he's such an asshole. he isn't alcohic but he is a drug addict. and going to rehab didn't really didn't change that much to him.

i never thought of being depressed, but growing up made me to. i am a lights operator in our church but they don't really care about knowing me. they just want my skills which makes me want to leave. going to church and having fellowship with my fellow teens makes all that sadness go away. but everytime the fellowship stops, being lonely and sad takes over me again. i only have a few friends to talk to in church and i don't think anyone wants to talk to me. not everyone even the pastor talks to me.

i have a few friends at school and a best friend but going to school is so boring.

my cousins in my mother's side, live in a different house and they are just always there for me. we watched tons of movie franchises, introduced me to a lot of games and whenever they come on vacation they want me to come with them. they know how abusive my father is and they want me to leave home and live with them. but the fact that they always yell at each other and they always fight is just so annoying and it drives me insane.

in the looks of it, this year 2020 got me trapped with my family for 1 whole year. i never thought it's going to be fun, there no church service and being trapped with an abusive father drives me insane and it's making my depression so much worse.. my family including my aunts and cousin always fight and they always yell.. i cant sleep very well. and fuck i cant even do my homework. i don't want to talk to my friends about what i feel just because i don't trust them.

there is alot of times in a middle of a lockdown where i was left at home with my father, and he kicks me out of the house for waking up late and being lazy and i dont know where to go in the middle of the pandemic. there was no one there to defend me, my mother was at work and i don't want to go to cousins house because they drive me insane.

well its not his house we why the fuck kick me out.
my mom knows how abusive he is and she also knows about him kicking me out. but she doesn't even bother to do anything. my mother is so kind to this idiot and that's where i thought she'd pick his husband rather than his children, and there is nothing i can do about that.

just how toxic and messed up this life is.

things are so messed up.

i never thought i would ever do this but i just wanna leave, leave my family behind. disappear forever. never comeback. no one knows i felt this way. not literally anyone. not even me. 

i kept asking my self why the fuck is everyone so fucking toxic!!! it just hurts me so much. so much pain id rather kill myself than leave.. because i am nothing without them. they are my family, but they also let me down. but i'll still do it, even if how hard it is. 

i must have a lot of money when that time comes 3 years from now.. i'll pack all of the things that i bought myself. meet with my best friend. maybe kiss her goodbye for a good friendship she gave me. and leave forever and never comeback. maybe find another love. maybe find a job.. maybe fulfill my dreams.. 

or just kill myself.

my thoughts: i hate how people say they want to end their life because of how miserable their life is but read this and think straight if you are going through this much pain as me. no one, not even my best friend and family knows about this. only you, me and the next person reading this. i hope i have someone to talk to about my feelings. i don't know what to do. i feel like i could end me any second now. im not afraid of dying because i'm already living in hell. 

this is very tough for me, the whole world has a problem right now and this is happening to me all at the same time.

it's too much.

no one is serious enough to talk to me and so if you reached this far,

i love you.

edit: thank you guys for all the hugs, all the advice and all the support. i appreciate it more than enough because it made me feel much better for now..",1
post_02900,"left abusive family now struggling in relationship  i (female) moved in with my girlfriend but my emotions have taken a nose dive since then. i feel like we are always doing what she wants to do. her pets are running the apartment. she got upset when i said they needed to be better trained. but my cat is anxious around her kitten, and her kitten keeps clawing all of us. i had just started to imagine what my life would look like now that i've left my family, and it feels like every day we spend together my vision of the world gets smaller.

            i want to travel the world. i was thinking of moving to another country in my twenties. or at least far away from the east coast. now it seems over and over the vision has to shift. my girlfriend is really attached to her consulting job and it only covers the south. she said she could move to the northeast or parts of the midwest. but that for the next few years she wants to be here.

            she keeps talking about marriage in a year. when we were 4 months into our relationship, she asked me when it would be okay for marriage. she wanted to be engaged at 6 months, but she understood waiting a year. i tried to push that off, but it was nerve wracking. i'm still not positive i want kids, but every time she is around her sister she keeps asking me about baby names. gods, i don't know what to do.

            the life i dreamed of was to become a successful writer. hopefully be able to make it full time with my fiction, and be able to travel the world during my first twenty years or so of my career doing historic research. saving up enough money and then kickstarting my publishing career in fiction to live off my creativity. i don't know that i see kids in the picture. and if i do, i'm not sure i see more than one and so early on in my life.

            my mom divorced after her husband threatened to kill her. she married my dad after three years and they have been in a miserable marriage my entire life. they fight all the time. i know it isn't healthy. but i don't fight at all with my girlfriend. when we have disputes, my girlfriend seems kind of dismissive. she seems like she is offering solutions but then it seems like nothing changes.

            i've been sleeping on the coach for the last few nights because her dog takes up so much space. dog also barks whenever don't throw their ball, and it triggers my ptsd. she calls her pets every sweet name under the sun but says she doesn't want to be cute names between us because she'll forget. but she switched my contact for her to ""baby"" on my phone. i've been aching because my autoimmune conditions are worsening, and i am stressed because my sister no longer wants to talk to me after my girlfriend moved in. i can't process this. i want to process this, but i feel like i'm the bad person for cutting everyone out.

            i need time to think. space to sort out my feelings. and i feel like i don't have that anymore. i feel like i'm being pressured into getting married to her. and its not like i dislike her. but i'm starting to grow not attracted to her. our apartment is messy and it gives me panic attacks. she insists on doing homecooked meals almost nightly, or else we go out to eat. but then i'm responsible for the dishes and the bed, and most of the tidiness in the space.

i had a bad flashback and just left the apartment to sit in the car. she texted me and said her sister said we could come over now. but i told her i was having a flashback and she said how could she help. i still felt like she want me to be better so i tried to swallow my panic and went back inside. she said it would be a quick trip but we stayed for more than four hours. 

tw: sex and body image
i initially didn't want to have sex when we first started dating, but then decided i did want to try with her (because of past trauma - not because she forced me). at first it was good, but her cat kept climbing on me during sex. we shut the door now, but sometimes my girlfriend will let her dog stay cause the dog is anxious. but now i have such a hard time feeling anything during sex. and as i've been getting weaker with my immune disorder her being almost a hundred pounds heavier than me is making me sore anytime we do have sex. and my lips always get swollen for days after. she has a disorder that makes it hard to control weight and people in her family that get eds from weight loss, and i get that. but i also feel like it's making me less attracted to her, and i feel horrible. i've had eating disorders but it also feels like she doesn't want me to lose any weight even when my doctors said i need to for my health and she doesn't want to either. 

i just feel alone because my best friend lives about an hour from us. he told me to hold off making any sudden moves with my relationship because my sister and i just stopped talking because she has sided with my abusive mom. 

i feel like i like my girlfriend but she's the first i've had and i've never had the healthiest relationships so i don't know if i'm jumping at ghosts. but i'm depressed and facing suicidal ideation again.

any advice is appreciated. ",1
post_00986,"i just got fired  like the title says i just got fired. i feel like a failure, at every job i get bullied and harrassed by people and they fire me if they are sick of me. i hate myself for it. my family tells me it's fine, but their eyes tell a different story, maybe it's the undiagnosed autism in me noticing these details, but i can see their dissapointment in me. i'm the failure in the family, the one that can't hold a job.

i'm tired of this life, i can't do it anymore. there is literally nothing here for me anymore, i want to be with my dog that died 3 years ago i miss him so bad. i hope a car hits me or i have to go the hospital, since i'm too scared to do it myself. i'm just at a loss for words right now, i just find it hard to be alive when all these things keep happening.

post_05703,"shit friends rant  i'm only 16 and i feel like such an idiot. i have quite a big group of friends (11 people, sounds more than it feels like though we are all v close) and i love them and all but sometimes they make me feel really bad about myself. i'm quite sensitive, i always have been, it's just how i am and i have sort of always been picked on because i think people can tell that: 1. it will hurt me 2. i wont confront them about it. when i was in year 9 (age 13/14) i was quite depressed and it's also the age where i started feeling more grown up sort of and i got a group of friends (around 6 of us) and i was just the punching bag. completely. i had things thrown at me (normally food from the canteen like cheese, jelly, etc but occasionally grass, mud, etc) was just constantly put down for my looks (not explicitly but it was idk how to explain) and i was just treated so badly and i felt so small, some of my closer freinds in that group would take part in it too and then call me later and apologise but would just do the same thjng. anyway at the end of year 9 i decided i was going to move friend groups in year 10 so i did, and it was great and i was still sort of freinds with that other group but much happier until end of year 10 when we started to merge and now the hybrid 11 people group. for some time it was fine and then it just started to feel like i was hated again. now i just feel so belittled all the time, i don't know how to deal with it. i'm only happy when i'm alone because then i know that my dislike for myself can stay hidden and i can finally feel like i'm in the company of someone who can bare to me around me without tearing my down. they're so mean i hate it. it's just like acting like they don't like me and then i'll get drunk (sorry underage drinking sorry sorry) and i'll talk to one of them and be like just asking over and over again if they like me and they'll assure me they do but like, do they? i am always so nice to all of them and they're just mean in return but i can't say anything about it because it's just ""joking"" and they ""do it to everyone"" but am i really so wrong for feeling like they do it to only me????? i just hate feeling like this i never want to go into school. my mum is my bestfriend and it doesn't help that my parents are divorced so i just miss her so much all the time i'm at my dads she's the only person other than myself that when i'm with her i don't feel hated. and it's just so hard because it's all piling over eachother, i am failing school and convinced i will fail my gcses, i am pretty sure i'm autistic and completely miserable and i can never focus on anything and i just feel so panicked about everything i hate going to school but i still love my freinds so i feel stupid even writing this. and also whenever i retaliate they're like ""don't get mad iris"" or like ""it's just a joke"" and it's so patronising 

sorry this is such ramble but i don't care i need to get off my chest, thanks lol x",0

post_00595,"i literally feel nothing i'd like to start this by saying i should be happy. literally nothing fundamentally wrong with my life. i'm an 18m with a pretty decent family that's not rich but also doesn't have financial problems. my parents have never been the kind that becomes friends with their children; they're present but distant, and i like to think this doesn't bother me.

ok house, ok family, decent love live past (although i'm currently single), good friends, and yet i would really like to be dead right now. i have motivation for nothing. i currently go to my 6h a day attendant job every day, and spend the rest of the day in bed doing nothing meaningful.

the fact that i'm not moving forward doesn't really bother me. pretty much nothing does. i don't feel sadness, nor happines, nor excitement, nor anything. i'm just quietly existing like a plastic bag drifting through the wind, yet i really don't feel like a firework lol. i'm not really picking a path; i feel like i just let everyone else decide what they want me to be, and i'll just become that.

being this meaningless used to cause me great pain and put me way closer to pulling the trigger, but 100mg of venlafaxine and 50mg of trazodone turned pain into abstence of literally everything. i really don't care whether i wake up tomorrow. in fact, if someone tried to rob me, i'd much much rather have them kill me than take my phone, since dying is better than the pain of having to live wihout a phone.

i'm kinda just picking whatever path causes me less pain, without any goal or objective. i feel like i'd like to have a good job in an area i actually like, but i don't really care enough to go through the pain of actually putting effort into it. just drifting through the wind.

and having my parents pay for my really fucking expensive depression treatment (psychiatrist, psychologist, drugs) without me getting any better just makes me feel like a massive useless burden they have to carry. i know if i die it'll be worse for them, especially if it is by my own hand, and that's pretty much one of the only things keeping me here, but i can't help but feel like my existence brings more harm than good. that's why i try to be as useful as possible to everyone around me, turning into exactly what they need me to be. i'm absolutely terrified of being a burden, yet i feel like i am just that for 60 minutes every hour.

i don't know if there's any cohesion to this block of text, and i don't think anyone's going to actually read this far, but dear reader, i know your immediate instinct is telling me to get help, but what do i do if i already have really supportive friends, and am already taking antidepressants and getting professional help?

how do you keep hope when it feels like the last 8 months of ""getting help"" worked exclusively to keep me from killing myself, so no one else has to feel bad for me while i still feel like shit?",1

i feel like my life has run it's course and i hope that no one else here has to experience this pain. 

i can understand why some of my clients made the choice to end their lives, and i hope they found the peace they were looking for.

now i'll be left with a a mortgaged apartment that with all the payments (bank, utilities, housing association etc) will eat up 3/4 of my pay. i'll will have to somehow sell the junker car that i own since i won't be able to cover gas, repairs, yearly inspections and insurance. i'll be left with enough money to basically cover the cheapest food i can get. she's even fucking taking our pet rats... i'll have to sell my things a piece by piece just to survive. i wish i never got this apartment.

im on probation rn, but ive had many unsucessful relationships lately. theres also something that happened which i cant get over. 1 is that a guy i was seeing - he wrote me a cold and mean message when we broke it off, he said he was thinking about his ex when we had sex and said he literally used me like some meat to his cock to get off. also my recent ex flirted with other women while being with me and tried to play it off as it his his natural urge as a man, he prolly also used me for money and sex. a lot of people ive been with only see me as an object for their desires. i really fucking hate these men who have used me like some damn fleshlight and stolen my love and attention, fucked up my life and got off on me. i feel like a fucking doll. every single guy ive been with as well, and mind you ive been w 9 guys in total + some people i were seeing - everyone of them has been unfaithful. one of my exes also called me a cum dumpster and a sex doll - this made me slap him in the face and scream at him for hours, my recent ex called me that as a joke to test me as well - and i was furious. i have never been treated like a real person by any man, and everyone that i think are okay breaks my damn trust. ive been grooped, treated like a pornstar and like a piece of meat since i was a kid.

i'm feeling sad, depressed, angry and scared. it's a very hard to put into words what i'm feeling right now. i don't feel like i'm just losing my vision, i feel like i'm losing my potential, my dreams and even my identity. 

i love coding and i've always wanted to be a software engineer one day but with how things are going now it feels almost impossible to achieve. i feel like giving up on it now.

another problem is that all my hobbies include sight, video games, animes and manga, tv shows and movies, reading books, drawing, football and chess. i tried to play a game few days ago but i couldn't. if i focus on my character i can't see the map or my health bar. if i focus on the map i can't see my character. it's like the informations slowly becoming something i couldn't parse. it was the first time i was like ""fuck i'm really going blind"".  it's a big hit and felt like a painful stab in my heart..

my family is supportive but i can see the pain they are feeling.  i can't help but feel bitter and angry. sometimes i wonder if it's a punishment for a major flaw in my character. for each loss in my vision i feel like i'm losing part of me. 

one day you are the funny reliable friend that people seek for advice and someday you are the pitied friend who lost his sight. one day you are the cool uncle who plays video games with his nieces or help them with their math homework and someday you will be the poor uncle who struggles doing basic tasks like going to the toilet or trimming his nails.

i don't wanna be a burden, i don't wanna make life difficult for those around me.  i don't wanna be dependant on others to do most things. i just wanna be me.
 
the most painful part of it all is the realization that someday i won't be able to see the people i love, their faces, their laughs, the new clothes they bought, or even watching football or enjoying a video game together. one day all of this will be gone. my life will be different, i will be different, everything will be different. it's like i clicked a reset button.

post_03834,"likely developed health anxiety and looking for advice hi all,

signed up here with the hope that someone could read my story and come up with some ideas or advice. apologies for the wall of text, i tried to put it as concise as possible without leaving out important details.

i am a 31-year-old male, never did any hard drugs and live a totally normal life with my girlfriend. there are no major diseases known in family. most certainly i spend way too much time in front of a desk either working, studying or playing video games. my spine is probably the body part i have treated the worst by far. i try to hit the gym three times a week.

i had my first experience with illness anxiety and potentially hypochondria (both not medically confirmed) almost three years ago when i noticed some slight burning pain in my throat. i went seeing a doctor and he told me it might be the reflux disease. even though i hadn't changed my diet or wasn't eating unusual things i followed his advice and changed my diet plus took pills to calm my stomach. the pills seemed to help a little however the described feeling continued to last for weeks, and i started to worry a little. i stopped to drink coffee and alcohol, no more fast food and different, more healthy breakfast. nothing seemed to have any effect, so i asked for a gastroscopy. nothing was found during the examination so hoped the feeling would eventually just go away, which it did a few weeks later and never returned. until today, i have no idea what caused it. shortly after i returned to my former eating habits and no longer took any pills. still, the feeling did never return.

about a year later i noticed a different strange feeling in the bottom right of my belly. it felt bloated in this area, and it also seemed to intensify whenever i was sitting for a longer period. i was very chill at that time but still wanted to find out what it was as i hadn't changed my lifestyle in any way. no doctor i visited in the next two months could tell me anything about it or make it disappear.  
i started to do research on the internet and of course i first came across reasons like stress and bad food but later also unlikely reasons like different sorts of tumors.

unlike in the ""throat pain""-story, i was more worried this time and i had a hard time stopping to think about it or avoiding further online research. this was maybe the first time when i started to exaggerate the situation. i cannot tell why but i relatively quickly started to believe it must be something dramatic this time which could potentially kill me in the long run if not treated.

i visited two or three doctors, but none could explain it to me or make it go away so i made an appointment for a colonoscopy but at the same time ordered two self-testing kits of amazon to check for blood in my you-know-what. both tests turned out negative and i started to relax. so much even that i cancelled the colonoscopy appointment and also because i read about the involved risks online.  
a few weeks later and with the feeling in my belly still being present, i started to worry again and i made another appointment which i took this time.  
nothing could be found, all good. i started to relax again after this and tried to ignore the symptoms from now on. i don't know when exactly, but the feeling disappeared after a few more weeks and never came back. i never discovered what it was, and i also didn't change any of my habits or diet.

after that anxiety episode i had a at least two more over the next years which i want to describe only briefly:

* i had problems to fall asleep which i believed could be some rare form of insomnia leading to death due to fatigue. it took me sometimes 3-4 hours to fall asleep but usually the next night was fine. those sleeping problems happened quite often until recent, especially when sleeping not at home but i never spend a full night awake. it was during this time that i also encountered my first moment of panic or very strong discomfort: i was with friends at a birthday and suddenly with no reason i started to feel extremely uncomfortable and had to leave the room. i went to the bathroom and tried to calm myself in front of the mirror. the feeling is hard to describe but at this moment i wanted to hide myself somewhere and not come out again until i felt better. it lasted for ten minutes and then i was ok again and returned to the birthday. if i remember correct, i had two similar events in the past two years. one time i couldn't leave the room, so i sat quietly and waited for the feeling to pass, which it did after five minutes or so. the last event of such form is now almost 6 months ago, gladly.
* minor pain inside my left chest which wouldn't go away for a couple of weeks. i read articles online about early symptoms of liver cirrhosis and actually considered it. i had my blood checked and liver examined with ultrasonic. nothing could be found, and the pain disappeared a few weeks later.

very recently, another anxiety episode has started and of course you might think ""this is the same thing, it's obviously psychological and nothing to actually worry about"", but like before i take it seriously and i am worried about a severe illness again.  
this time it frightens me even more and i am having strong difficulties getting it out of my thoughts:

in august 2024 i started noticing a strange minor pain in my right calf, which i feel until present day. on some days it is less intense and on other days it is more present and radiates into my foot and thigh. i started running during this time and as i am a bloody amateur of course i thought it might have something to do with the wrong shoes or me not running correctly. i went to an orthopedist, and he had no idea what it could be. when i mentioned that i started running recently, he was sure that it has something to do with it and i should pause for a while. this pause is still going on, so i doubt it has anything to do with me not running properly in august last year or using the wrong shoes.

because the orthopedist couldn't help me (i visited another and he said the same thing as the first), i started researching and after some time came across ms and als which caught my attention. i wasn't concerned about such illness at this moment, but a few days later new symptoms of all sorts started to appear: brief muscle twitches, cold hands and feet, tingling under my skin and very slight numbness from time to time. i started to worry more even though i knew chances of developing such a rare illness right after reading about it for the first time, are more than slim.

i saw a neurologist and had a mrt of my head done (without contrast medium). the mrt results came back clean, nothing unusual detected. my neurologist was happy, case closed for him, and i still had no answers to what was going on.

the weeks passed by, and i slowly managed to accept my situation and paresthesia.

by mid-december 2024 all the described symptoms had disappeared except the pain in my calf and the muscle twitching (decreased in frequency though). however, whenever i turn my head to the right now, it starts shaking slightly and the shaking radiates into both shoulders and upper arms. i turn my head to the left and the shaking stops. i have the feeling that the intensity increases when i am under pressure e.g. fight with my girlfriend, important presentation at work, etc. but i cannot tell for sure. on a lot of days, i also wake up with a tension in my neck and upper back which sometimes result in headaches. i sometime also ""check"" my body in the mirror if all muscles are looking ok and functioning properly.  
i had minor problems with my upper spine before, nothing was ever diagnosed but one time i had to stop working and lay down because i felt dizzy suddenly and developed a pain in my upper spine. the dizziness was completely gone the next day, but the pain lasted a few more days. similar issues when i bought a new car, i couldn't drive it for more than ten minutes before strong back pain started to develop in my upper spine. gladly this didn't last for long and today i still drive the car but without any back pain.

coming back to the slight shaking of my head, my neurologist first thought it is another symptom of my described anxiety but once i showed him, he said i should go see an orthopedist and this isn't anything in his area of expertise because of the way i can trigger and make it stop by turning my head.

this is pretty much where i am right now. i booked myself a first appointment with a psychologist in the coming week but cannot let go of the feeling that everything i did in the past was normal and that there is something in me which just has not been discovered yet. with going to a psychologist, i have the feeling that i am moving in the wrong direction and no longer focusing on the actual symptoms and their reason.

i want to add that even though i am thinking about the described a couple times per day, it doesn't control me, and i live a totally normal life. i haven't shared these thoughts with anyone except my girlfriend. i want to get rid of the symptoms and find a way to remain way more calm.  
for me this feels like an important task that i want to complete but never find the time to do it, so it keeps sitting on my todo list and bothers me every day a little when i look at the list.

if you made it till here, my sincere thanks. i hope somebody can provide me with some advice.",0

post_01413,"i had a bath while wearing a sweatsuit today my partner and i have been fighting for months, i have a degenerative chronic illness that's been kicking me for the last few days.

around 7pm it hit me. as it usually does, i had gotten two sleeves in 2022 to not self harm and i haven't because they were expensive and i would feel terrible for destroying my artists work. 

but i filled my bathtub and i was going to do it. i wrote a note on my phone for my partner, i sent him 3k of my student loans and made a note of my banking information so he could take the rest and make life better for himself- pay off his debt and be able to live. i sat on the edge of the tub while the water filled, for the first time in months my head was clear and i felt calm. i was ready to join the 27 club. part of this felt like exercising my free will- something i think we lose. sometimes you need to throw an egg at your cabinet to realize life is yours. i stood in the hot bath fully clothed and just laid there waiting for the courage as i finished my note. contemplating whether i'd meet my partner in another life where circumstances could be different, if i would be reunited with my guineapigs passed and if i could wait for the three i have now. 

there was so much peace being weighed down in the tub. it was different than a weighted blanket. there was intention, a means to an end. it felt like that episode of the office where michael says "" i crashed my car into a fkn lake "" but internally and a lot less angry at modern technology.

i had gotten a notification that my amazon order arrived. i had purchased a massage gun at 3am while in pain the prior night. i didn't want a porch pirate to take it from my partner. he works a labor intensive job and he'd benefit from it. so, i got up. took off the wet clothes and got the package after changing into dry clothes.

mdd and navigating a degenerative disorder with no cure and little medical understanding is a hell i'm trying so hard to get out of. i don't want to die- but there's no cure for me and society isn't built for people with disabilities. i don't want to die but i'm so tired of fighting tooth and nail to be accepted and valued for who i am. i don't have family or friends and my eds has officially taken a toll on my vision  and i wasn't allowed to drive prior to- but now i'm just going to not be allowed to period. it's a weird place to be, not being able to go to the doctors and get help, when you rely heavily on facebook groups for support and guidance.

post_00569,"i tried to kill myself but survived and no one knows january  8th 2020 i was driving home listening to amy winehouse and decided that this was my time. it was on a windy, empty country road, late at night, in torrential rain- accidents happened there all the time. i had just finished having dinner with my housemate at university and was on my way to my hometown to see my family. no one would suspect a thing. i closed my eyes, let go of the steering wheel and put my foot down. 

when i opened my eyes my vision was blurred, but i could see that my windshield had caved in. i proceeded to crawl out across the passenger seat, opening the door with my elbow as hands were covered in shards of glass. there was no shock, no confusion. i felt a small sense of relief that i wasn't paralysed, and a bigger sense of relief that i hadn't hit anyone else. but other than that, i still felt just as dead inside as i had prior to the crash.

i went through the motions. strangers came to my aid, followed shortly by the paramedics and later my parents. i laughed and smiled through it, cracking jokes about ordering my preferred cocktail of pain relief and apologising for keeping everyone up so late. i had just survived a near fatal car crash and already the guilt and shame of everyone worrying about me was kicking in.

i had aquaplaned across the road, accelerating into a hedge, before flipping my 2004 corsa four times, knocking down a row of silver birches in the process and spinning 20m down the country lane. i had landed upright but the roof of the car had moulded around my headrest. i'm only 5'2"", if i was a couple of inches taller my head would have been caved in. i should have been dead. 

instead, i spent a week in hospital lying on my back, completely immobilised, awaiting my c7 spinal surgery. post-surgery, my doctor told me he'd seen mri scans like mine where the patient had already been paralysed, so i guess the fact that i walked out of hospital after 9 days with just a neck brace was a silver lining. 

since then i've carried on keeping up appearances. things have changed, some for the better, some for the worse. for a while, my frustration that i had survived was outweighed by my relief that i wasn't paralysed, and in truth that is still the case. but my fear of putting my family through something like that again is starting to wear off. it's a constant fight between my happiness and their grief. what's more important? should i continue to suffer silently in a world where i feel completely lost and alone, just to postpone their mourning for what will eventually happen anyway?",1

i found out that my best friend of 20 years was arrested for cp, and he fully confessed too it. not just that he had it but was also distributing it. on top of that it has been going on for years, completely unbeknownst  to anyone. 

i am just sitting here in complete shock and horror. this person and been the closest  thing i have had to a brother in my life. he was the best man at my wedding. his parents were my support during my parents divorce. my father would joke about how he was a bonus son. just to find out he is a monster. needless  to say he is dead too me.

i keep wishing he had just killed himself. i am sick now knowing what he was doing behind everyones backs. just so he could get off to the worst possible fantasies a human could have. he was to be the uncle to my kids. instead he was destroying lives for his own pleasure. i have never been so angry  as i am now. if given the chance i would kill him for what he has done.

i feel so stupid for not seeing this sooner. my wife says there was nothing i could have done. the only peace i have is he got caught. i just want to rant.

post_00680,"worried my life is over before it even had a chance to begin. my whole life story. not set up to succeed. kept imprisoned since birth. you may have heard most of this before. but now i am sharing it publicly on my main account. because i am desperate and no longer have any shame or fucks left to give. there is no life for me here and i have felt suicidal all my life and almost committed suicide last year because i can't find a way to escape. i can't let this be my life and this is pure torture and torment, so i was going to escape the only way that was available.

no one has my best interest in mind and they treat me like i don't matter. like my needs don't matter and like i don't deserve a good life. i was born in a really bad place (a third world country) where i don't belong, i don't share any values or worldviews with them, and nothing about this place is normal to me or reflects who i am at all. there is no life for me here. i didn't have a life, a childhood, or any relationships with anyone i love or respect. i hate this place and always have. i was abandoned as a newborn, but it's not like it matters, since the people who adopted me have not given me a good life, because, quite frankly, no one here can give me what i need. they think a good life is superfluous. but they were especially abusive, and even people here would probably agree. they are religious extremists, moralists, and pro-life. i am irreligious and pro-choice. i used to be an atheist/materialist (even as a kid i never believed in their religion, they could never condition me), now i am quite spiritual/idealist and woo woo. but still very much an individualist and independent thinker. i am not a realist or practical. i believe in the impossible. i am very sensitive, so being in this hostile environment that is not aligned with my soul's truth is really harmful and distressing.

i don't know how this was allowed to happen to me. the fact that they think they know what's best for me or that they are my people or that they are good for me when they have abused me my entire life and i feel so uneasy and disturbed by their presence is so unsettling. i have nowhere to turn to. this place is so crowded. i hear everything and just being in this environment is so disturbing. even in my room. i can't get any peace. and knowing that if i open the door and go outside it gets much worse. even if i was in a soundproof box. i would still feel disturbed by just being here. just because it's normal for them, it's not normal for me. nothing about this place is normal. and they treat me like i'm the problem and that i am crazy and i am not allowed to feel the way i feel and think like i think. that who i am inside doesn't matter. they think they own me and that i belong here, when i don't. they are not my family. just hearing their voices makes my skin crawl. they never were. but they keep getting away with this. this is not my life. i need to leave.

i just want to be able to live life unburdened by the expectation to be someone i am not. and free from this fake identity and role that were imposed on me and do not reflect me in the slightest.

they think i am the problem and it took me a while to heal from the damage of the years of being invalidated and gaslit, including by the dozens of therapists i was forced to see. no matter who i talk to here, and explain i've been psychologically abused by my parents, they always take their side and say i should be grateful and have nothing to complain about, and that i need help, but not in a nice way, they just think the way i think is wrong. that i should be grateful i don't technically live in a slum, and that i was adopted, that i am educated (when everything i know i had to teach myself), that i am not starving. and, like, i have nothing. i don't have a life, i have none of my needs met, but i am expected to give up who i am and live for other people i don't even like, people i absolutely hate, because the little that i have is apparently too much. that i should just accept this and stop complaining. they are unwilling and unable to understand me and the extent to which they have wronged me. they think they own me, and that i shouldn't have a choice as to who i am. i need to leave.

i don't understand why i am expected to have to deal with this and talk to these people and have to interact with people who disturb me to my core, and be surrounded by them, being forced to hear them playing their disgusting music. i literally have to have something playing 24/7 on my headphones, so i don't hear what's going on outside and the noises people make, because then i am reminded of them and who i am surrounded by. i also can't meditate or listen to something relaxing, because some of the outside noise will seep through and ruin the vibe and throw me off completely and make me panic. i have to wait until i literally pass out every time i sleep because i can't just lie down quiet, it's not my thoughts that are the problem, it's the environment and noises that don't let me relax, and i am pretty sure i wouldn't have to worry and would be easier for me to dismiss scary and intrusive thoughts if i knew i was safe, but i am still here. i am still in the dangerous situation. i watched a reading a few weeks ago that summed up a lot of what i am having to deal with pretty well, she said what she was picking up on was ""the dichotomy between how you feel within your own being and what you know to be your truth spiritually, versus what the world shows you and how the world treats you"". it's about the fake life i am forced to live and about how people project their stuff and expectations onto me here and that it's an ugly duckling type of scenario. they could never do right by me.

i have really tried up until a couple of years ago, i went to therapy, i sort help, even saw a few local spiritual practioners, but they only ended up doing more harm than good because of their perspective and how they see the world, i am glad it didn't work out because i was seeking help from the wrong people, people who could never understand me or my needs, i literally couldn't physically continue this charade or pretend to have this fake life, or having to continuously interact and deal with them and have that be my life. and i came to learn that was the correct thing to do, gave me some peace of mind and brought me back to my energy. me having to ""live"", work, study here, interact with them, i couldn't do that. it would destroy my soul, and just being here does. every time i am forced to talk and interact with them is torture. they don't care about me and my feelings or well being, i don't care about them either, this situation doesn't benefit anybody, they are energy vampires and survive off draining me, they know that once i am gone, they will stop being able to feed off my precious and rare energy, they just want to dim my light because they know what i have and am, they could never have that or be that.

someone left me somewhere, at a sort of social work department of a maternity hospital when i was approximately 2 weeks old, and what had happened to me up until that point is a mystery.

it's really messed up because in my adoption papers it says that someone was handed me to hold by presumably my mother nearby the hospital while they would make a phone call and they would come back and never did, but then apparently someone talked to the people who worked there a nurse at the time, and she said what she heard from the people who worked at that department that it was my mother herself, a teenager apparently who went to the social work department directly and left me there and didn't provide any identifiable information and they just let her leave.

and then i was put up for adoption. but anywhere i ended up here would have been just as bad. they came up with this whole story that the person who got handed me on the street, was handed me by an east asian lady, so confusing, it's what's on my adoption papers, but there aren't many people other than locals here, because who would want to immigrate here, and i did one of those genealogical dna tests in order to find who did this to me, and never got a close enough match, but i am not of asian descent, they just said that because to them i looked like it when i was a newborn, so they just came up with this whole story to cover up for her, and they didn't take a name or anything. probably gave birth to me in the hospital and was told to bring me back later, and forego the whole adoption process.

so cover ups, deceit, and lies from the off. a whole conspiracy against me. there is no one or no where i can turn to. i was told all the time as a kid, that i was a bad person, and should live in fear of some karmic retribution, consequences, and having to pay. that i was a liar, and a bad person, and that life was going to get me (when it already had. they were trying to make me fear hell, when i was already in it, lol), when the reality was they were just too strict. and also being told that you have to work hard and toil and suffer and that life is struggle and sacrifice. they just made me live in fear. that at any point i could lose anything. and things could get worse. and i would just have to learn to live with it. and they told me that life is sacrifice and struggle. and that suffering is somehow a virtue. they have no concept of quality of life, mental well being, or hobbies. anything. they don't know what that is. they don't care that i wasn't set up to succeed, no one here cares about that. they think life here is normal.

my parents made me get into local universities four times. and every time i had to take this stupid exam, because they don't have something like an sat exam or a-levels, and i had to take this exam every year and can't ever reuse the scores or anything. but i would attend the first few classes and then start skipping and going to the library to be on my laptop because i literally couldn't physically bring myself to attend them. like, they don't have many course options here, nothing interesting, and it's a very closed off country to the world, the way they teach things is wrong. everything they teach is so wrong, they are so closed off to the world at large and really ignorant about stuff. so, it's not like a course i could sit through. i couldn't have a job here or have most of my time be spent listening or talking to these people living this fake life.

there is no institutional support here and i have spent all my life in therapy and they have done me more harm than good, people here don't know what quality of life and wellbeing is. i have had to learn myself to undo the damage they have done to me.

i have literally been forced to interact with those people for decades now, i literally can't stand this anymore. i feel like i will go insane and start banging my head against the wall or something if i am forced to have a life here and have to interact with these people.

i can't even bear to be here. i will never feel good here. this is agony and torture. life is asking too much of me. to figure out a way out and to have some mental and emotional well being. well, i can't whilst living in this place. it's just not conducive to that. i don't know what i am supposed to do. i can't be okay with everything going on around me and just being here. i can't be focused or at peace or have a game plan. i can't function at all. i can't do anything about the situation and i can't bear to even be in this country. i might start banging my head against the walls. how can i do anything? be expected to focus on anything and just be fine when i am in this shithole. i will never be happy in this place. i am not okay. i need help. and it's not available. not mental health help. they have tried for years to ""fix"" me with therapy and meds. i am too good for this place. i will never be happy or feel good or even function here. no institutional help, i have no rights, nowhere to turn to. well, this place is the problem. can't go asking for help from the people that are the problem and have harmed me. not that i haven't tried. and i want nothing from them anyway. they literally can't understand me. i can't stand all the gaslighting and abuse. this place is the bane of my existence and my personal hell.where i am being forced to live is the reason for all my trauma, there is no quality of life here, it is a culture i don't belong in, i am being abused, there is no life for me here and i am constantly disturbed to my core by the surroundings and external stimuli, because this place is unsettling and disgusting. and i can't do anything to leave because of my debilitating anxiety, ocd, intrusive thoughts. i am in constant fight or flight mode and mid-trauma and have been for all my life.

i struggle with constant intrusive thoughts and ocd. i feel like i spend 24/7 battling them and fending my deepest fears off. they are mainly thoughts of me becoming someone i am not (someone from this place), or that i could start thinking and feeling like them or find this place appealing. those who are familiar with pure o and intrusive thoughts know they attack your core identity and values and try to convince you that you are or could become someone completely opposite to what you are.

i just feel this constant threat looming over and that i have to be hypervigilant, because sometimes the intrusive thoughts come so i have to keep reassuring myself all the time of my true opinions and feelings about things, and try to keep them at bay, and sort of worried about doing enough to correct the intrusive thoughts when they come. because i can't find myself in the things around me and this environment and there are a lot of projections and expectations on me to be someone that is the opposite of what i am, so it's like my mind and my sense of self is the only thing i have and that's so at odds with reality and circumstances, and this ""life"" right now and the people i have surrounding me. i have always felt like i had to protect my self and my whole identity and being was constantly under threat.

this has always felt like an ugly charade they have put together just to torture me, and it feels like i am stuck in this nightmare. life is asking too much of me. when all i have needed since i was a child was safety, security, and a home and i never had that. it's a miracle i have survived this far. i remember thinking when i was a kid that no one in the history of humanity had suffered as much as i had or felt like that, even if their circumstances had been worse on paper, because that was my personal hell and i feel things very deeply. and honestly, i am still kind of convinced no one has. 27 seven years. people get less time for murder.

if it's not clear from the text, i am being forced to ""live"" in a squalid third world shithole, and people here are extremely ignorant and backwards.

there is no one or no where i can turn to. i was told all the time as a kid, that i was a bad person, and should live in fear of some karmic retribution, consequences, and having to pay. that i was a liar, and a bad person, and that life was going to get me (when it already had. they were trying to make me fear hell, when i was already in it, lol), when the reality was they were just too strict. and also being told that you have to work hard and toil and suffer and that life is struggle and sacrifice. they just made me live in fear. that at any point i could lose anything. and things could get worse. and i would just have to learn to live with it. and they told me that life is sacrifice and struggle. and that suffering is somehow a virtue. they have no concept of quality of life, mental well being, or hobbies. anything. they don't know what that is. they don't care that i wasn't set up to succeed, no one here cares about that. they think life here is normal.abandoned and left behind to rot and be misunderstood, abused and psychologically tormented, and expected to live a fake life. i can't get out of this on my own. but people are unwilling to acknowledge that i am not the problem, i have been wronged. and i can't pull myself out of this situation on my own. i am in a disturbing environment that disturbs me to my core, surrounded by abusers. if my needs were acknowledged i wouldn't be in this mess.

i have spent all of my teenage years and up until a couple of years ago. going to the therapist every week. and gone through many psychiatrists and psychologists and prescribed all the depression and anxiety medications there are. honestly, everything they have told and how they treated me only did me more harm than good. nothing they have ever said has ever helped. completely ineffective treatments, it's almost like i wasn't the problem and it's the case that i am in a traumatic situation and don't have my needs met. i have been working on myself and undoing the damage that they have done. started listening to myself. only after i went off on my own, and started awakening spiritually that's when i started, well, finding myself, and that, you know, acknowledging my own needs and seeing how abused and wrong i was, because all they could do before was gaslight me and side with my parents. and i used to be really depressed and pessimistic, the most pessimistic person ever, now i have found hope within, you know, even when i used to think the only way out of this was to off myself, it was from a place of self-respect and self-love, and not resining myself to these circumstances i was optimistic and looking forward to getting a new life, hopeful for a new life. i was looking to the future with a sense of hope and possibility. so, yeah. i know enough about this place and how things work here, and also, you know, not wanting to deal with them because they disturb me, and i know they'll never understand me or my needs.

and i have been on anxiety medication. on benzos at some point. and medication for ocd, that it was me who had to find out that i had it. because they had misdiagnosed me so much in the past. but honestly, i never felt any difference. because that would be periods between treatments where i would come off them for a few months and or between treatments. never felt a difference, it never got worse or better. it's almost like that wasn't the problem. because how could i ever be satisfied with a fake life. and when you are not living your truth, it's meant to be uncomfortable, otherwise i wouldn't leave. i would just live empty and apathetic because i here i am living this lie in a role imposed on me by others that has nothin to do with who i actually am, and not surrounded by anything that has any meaning to me or reflects me, my purpose, or truth in anyway. because my soul knows i deserve more.

they have treated my needs for safety, home, quality of life, and to be around my people as fanciful pipe dreams all my life. they would just tell me to get a life here and make friends here and have a job here, and maybe one day i could leave, when i can't let this be my life, or become this fake person. this isn't even the real world. everything about this place is completely backwards. being forced to live like them and speak their language, and not have access to any of the experiences, stimuli, or environments i needed. it's not like they didn't force me. and i had been living inside their ugly charade they built until i couldn't take it anymore. they were asking me to sacrifice my whole being. and i was doing that. not anymore. i like this quote that goes ""before you diagnose yourself with depression or low self-esteem, first make sure that you are not, in fact, just surrounded by assholes.""

i suffered a corneal abrasion recently and am so worried my vision could end up blurry for good. i just realised it is because i never learnt how to gently tap my tears away or wipe them. i am generally pretty hard and apply pressure because they usually sting. and i cry every day.",1
post_06119,"10 years ago today, my mom found out my half brother had been sexually abusing me she snooped through my phone and went through messages with my first love/boyfriend. he was the only person i had told. i tried to lie...then minimize...then slowly i told her. she cried and i felt shame cover my body.


 i was 7 when he started. my mom walked in at one point when he had laid a small pillow on the ground and got on top of me. i was a little girl. he was a young preteen/teen. she made a rule...no closed doors. but she stopped enforcing it after a few weeks and the abuse continued.


 when she found out, she told my dad (my brothers bio dad too) he pretended nothing happened.


a few years later i lived with my dad. he told me my half brother ""timmy"" was coming to live with us. that he was homeless and he had to be a good dad to him too. my bedroom opened to the living room timmy slept in. i knew i was safe. i was older and he wasn't so big as when i was a little girl but the fear never left and nights were brutal. i slept from 5am to 12pm. i had a distant memory of my dad kicking out timmy when we were younger because he snuck my dad's laptop to watch porn. he kicked timmy out for touching his things for sexual purposes but he welcomed him home after knowing timmy touched his daughter for sexual purposes. timmy didnt show up to the job my dad got him. he had driven his car into a tree on a heroine overdose. he ran away and never came back to my dads house. 


a year later i was at my dads for thanksgiving. he told me 5 minutes before dinner started that timmy was almost there. i was shocked. i didnt have time to gather myself and i awkwardly stood by the food table as others talked to timmy. my dad came over and gritted his teeth. he seethed that i was being rude and needed to go talk to timmy. i did as i was told, like always, and walked over and put on a face to talk about the weather and his new job. 


i texted my dad the next morning. i said i was hurt by his actions and i was uncomfortable. i said i didn't want to be around timmy because of the sexual abuse. my dad never spoke to me again. that was 5 years ago. 


some days i wish they had never found out. how could i face the reality of how they've failed me or turned a blind eye. my mom tells me often how i had a good childhood. when i tell her it wasn't good she yells or cries or shames me.


after years of dating older men or men that abused me as well as suffering from depression, anxiety, and ptsd i went to therapy. i now train people in child sexual abuse prevention. i advocate for children. i have a well paying job and a healthy relationship. i have tons of hobbies and friends. im a leader. i have boundaries! i didnt just survive csa, i am thriving in spite of it and i know without a shadow of a doubt that nobody would know unless i told them, not because i wear a mask but because i am genuinely happy and well adjusted now. 


so happy 10 year to my secret being exposed and the beginning of my journey of healing (that will be ongoing for the rest of my life) and growth!",0
post_03181,"hypochondriac since 2020 ever since i've become an adult, i found myself fearing pain and sickness. constant dull pain in my back? secretly a side effect to a prescribed drug i had suddenly gotten despite taking it for over a year. seed gets lodged between your teeth somehow;  causing 2 days of pain and questioning the crookedness of my teeth and if it actually dislodged my teeth - or maybe a cavity despite brushing daily and flossing every chance i get!
then you go out in public and every stupid npc coughs and snarls in the air as if 2020 never happened. i was at a restaurant with family and this old fuck is sitting near the bar coughing up a storm straight from the bowls of his lungs and i decided to talk unfiltered noise-wise about it being sick season and how we should cover up. old guy walks past my table to go to the bathroom and old fuck rips a fat one he's saved since 1944 and i lose my entire appetite. why can't we just fucking learn from our mistakes??? at this point, with the fart and coughing he's doing biochemical warfare!

post_00694,"i hate existence, my indoctrination and other sht i swear i post here every day, it is so fucking pathetic because nothing changes, if anything it all gets worse each day and coming back here feels like my failure to end it already.
i hate my parents for ever giving birth to me. i hate that life was forced onto me and i am forced to deal with the horror of existence. it's so clear to me how violating being born and forced to exist is to the point i loathe the life-lovers around me. i can tell everyone knows getting old is miserable and there is no point to stay but they are too afraid to pull the plug. i do not see how anyone could possibly be happy. i'm so fucking miserable. it isn't fair. this is my life. i should have all authority to kill myself if i want to. 'you're 18, it gets better' shut the fuck up. do you really think i believe that bullshit? i non-stop see people in their 20s and how miserable and exhausted they are. 30s? that's people gasping onto youth and mourning the past. 40s? 50? same shit. 60? health problems and you lose your fucking mind. 
why do people indoctrinate children into believing life is a positive thing when it is horrific and awful? i hate myself (ugly, undesirable, cowardly,etc.) but a part of me feels pity that i even have to kill myself because i never asked to be here.
it is tragic. i'm uncomfortable around a guy in his 40s i've known a few years who is a mentor type and i can't tell if i'm being groomed or not but i know i'm uncomfortable and sad but who even gives a fuck, i'm 18 and nobody protects or cares about you anymore. if something happens to me i deserve it. i'm so stupid and dumb, i hate myself. i wish i was a kid again, i want to die. life is a horrible thing",1
post_05903,"i was having lunch with my friends for my birthday, i went to the bathroom and when i came back, everyone had left... there was a small moment where i thought 'that's okay, they're busy and i really appreciate that they came and had lunch'. that was when i noticed the package with my name on it sitting on my chair. inside was a ransom note, a blacklight, and some random puzzle pieces. what followed was a four hour epic journey around the city, solving puzzles. this included a trip into a bar where the bartender said 'i've been expecting you', and handed me another set of locked boxes and puzzles as he poured me a whisky. eventually  it finished at some accommodation they had booked for the weekend, along with the final address of a bar where everyone was waiting for me. they designed everything themselves. i was so utterly overwhelmed and humbled by the extraordinary effort they went to for me. these people are funny, smart, kind, and generous and i always feel lucky that i know them at all, let alone get to call them my friends. the world is a much better place for having them in it.

post_02680,"i've lost everyone and i keep losing everything and i want to end it all i was an amazing person back in 2022. i was surrounded by people who didn't care if i was annoying, people who actually liked me and gave me support, i was doing great in college (despite living in a tiny ass studio apartment across the street from an annoying ass frat house and having really bad insomnia) and made the dean's list, i genuinely loved my life.

i met certain people in 2023 and it turned my life upside down. they scrutinized every fucking word that ever came out of my mouth without letting me explain myself. i suffered a mental breakdown one night because they were talking shit to me and decided to get away from them the next day, but one of those fucking pieces of shit reached out to me and made up a bunch of lies saying that they actually cared about me and were wondering what was going on and i fucking fell for it. surprise surprise, they kept talking shit about me and putting me under so much pressure that i lost my shit at this one guy i looked up to, and now he absolutely fucking despises me and doesn't want anything to do with me.

i've tried going back to college three times now but i can't even last a month without losing my shit. i'm trying to work a job but i have so much anxiety that i feel like i'm going to lose my shit. i've been going to therapy every fucking week for the past year and taking all my meds every single day but nothing ever fucking gets better. i always end up going into a psych ward every few months because i can't stop myself from telling people that i'm going to kill myself. i'm literally having nightmares about these people almost every night for the past few weeks and it's always a reminder that i'm a piece of shit and will always be a piece of shit. the last thing i want is to be institutionalized because i know it won't fucking help.

post_05943,"people who classify themselves as a ""ass/tits man"" have no right to complain when women state that they prefer tall men or a large phallus. waiting to downvoted since this is a male dominated website but whatever.

if you have ever openly declared yourself as preferring ass over tits (or vice versa) as well as openly stated that your prefer ""big"" or ""small"" whatever then you have no right to complain when women state their preferences. if you have ever made fun of a woman for being fat, having small breasts, having a small butt etc. then you have no right to complain when someone says the same kind of remarks about penis size, height, or strength. there is nothing wrong with having a preference there is something wrong with creating a hierarchy about uncontrollable factors such as body parts. if you have ever used cruel terms like roast beef lips, pancake tits, pepperoni nipples (isn't it amazing how many terms we have used to reduce women to a consumable product) then you have no right to complain when others are critical towards your physical appearance. i think it's unnecessary and immature when people both male and female accuse people of having a small penis, however usually the first thing that a woman is attacked about is her appearance as well so your experience isn't unique. don't want to be reduced to your penis size? don't reduce women. you may say that you have had women lose interest once they found out your height or penis size, and once again your experience is not unique. many women are turned down due to their weight and level of perceived beauty. never ever have i seen a man's accomplishments be belittled or undermined by how ""fuckable"" they are perceived as. don't want people to be judgmental towards you? then stop judging others.

post_00658,"thinking about suicide comforts me. in the last 3-4 years, i started to have suicidal ideations.  i am an alcoholic, have adhd, and have pretty much ruined my life in every aspect.  the alcohol is the only thing i truly enjoy.   i'm 44 now and have accepted that i will not be able to get married and raise a family.   i can't keep a job or a relationship long enough.  i am bankrupt.  i can only get low-paying menial jobs that i get sick of very quick.  

i will either drink myself to death or jump off a bridge before my 50th birthday.   when i think about my fate, i am comforted.  i don't have to live in my personal hell if i don't want to.  knowing i can end things on my terms whenever i decide brings relief.

i am currently looking for reassurance because i am getting to my last rope. does anyone else wake up and immediately feel anxious, like a sense of impending doom, as if you feel each step will be your last? does anyone constantly worry about having a heart attack, brain aneurysm, ""going insane,"" blacking out and having the lack of oxygen kill your brain cells permanently? does anyone else when having a panic attack get incredibly cold, have trouble standing up, start to hate yourself and how this anxiety has destroyed your life? when you get into a car you feel trapped and start to become weak and feel like you need to get out of the car so you can die more comfortably on the side of the road? has anyone else dropped out of school, quit their job, lose their friends and relationships because they just can't leave their house most of the time, can't deal with the anxiety? 

what do you do? 

what did you do?

is there a way past this? is there a way past this without medication?

post_06136,"my stepdad lied about me being pregnant to ""teach me a lesson,"" and it traumatized me when i was 15, my stepdad decided to ""teach me a lesson"" about responsibility in the most cruel and manipulative way imaginable. he lied and told me i was pregnant. it has come out that i had had premarital sex. he made me pee in a cup and claimed he ""tested"" it. i didn't see what he did, but he came back and said i was pregnant. i had no reason to doubt him.

for roughly five months, 18 weeks, i believed i was going to have a baby. my body even seemed to respond—i gained weight, had morning sickness, cravings, and even felt what i thought were kicks. i mentally prepared for this child. i grieved the life i thought i'd lose as a teen mom but also grew to love the baby i thought was growing inside me. my reputation at school took the expected hit. and then the hit you'd expect when i don't end up having that baby. yep, i became that girl.

when i finally asked about getting prenatal care, he laughed and told me he'd lied the entire time. it was at the dinner table and i'll never forget my mental state shattering. i was devastated among many other things. to make things worse, he found the pregnancy journal i had been writing in every week for the baby to one day read. he confiscated it and quoted it back to me laughing at my thoughts and feelings for weeks afterward.

it felt like i had lost a child, even though there was never a baby. it always felt wrong to say i suffered a miscarriage so i never felt like i could talk to somebody about the kind of grief i felt.

this experience has haunted me for years. it's left me with trust issues, trauma, and a lingering grief that's hard to explain to anyone who hasn't been through something similar. i've tried to find others who've had an experience like mine, but i haven't found anything.

i wanted to share my story here because i feel like this kind of thing hasn't been talked about. if you've been through something similar, i'd love to hear from you. and if not, thank you for letting me get this off my chest. 

eta - the first time i ended up actually pregnant, they ended up being twins. this feels symbolic. like i was given the child i ended up not having in addition to the one i was to have then. it's comforting when i look at it that way. like my love for them was real even if they weren't. so real that the baby just had to come into existence.

post_06041,"yesterday i had my physically abusive wife arrested we have been together for 11 years, married for 9. things have always been a bit stormy beteeen us, but have been getting worse for about 6 months. she is very controlling and manipulative to the extent my wages had to be paid into her account, i had to do the housework to her specification, or else she would lash out at me with wooden spatulas. if i argued with her she lashed out. if i talked moderately (she called it ""shouting"") she would lash out. she would also deny me meals, wouldnt allow me to have my own door key, she told me i was worthless and nobody would want me. if i tried to defend myself from her attacks she said she would have me arrested and i would lose my job. yesterday was the last straw. after being hit once again, i called the police and had her arrested. i have moved out of the home, i'm in a bed and breakfast tonight. tomorrow i'm going to the council about getting accommodation.  my life is now restarting and this time i'm in the driving seat.

post_00953,"after you read this, ill be dead. take that however you want to  i dont want anyone to discourage me from suicide. i want to die, no matter how painful the process is. 
to be honest, this is more of a suicide note. i never really intended on writing one in the first place--but life is like a fucking book, so it needs a good resolution. this post might as well be the conclusion paragraph to my life. 

people are probably going to look at my post history and go like ""oh but you're 16, you have so much ahead of you, and you're probably just going through a phase"" 
i would've had a fucking future waiting for my with open arms, if i was a fucking neurotypical boomer. im not going to have a great future if people like me (autistic) are considered to be intellectually disabled and cant hold a fucking job. im especially not going to enjoy life as an adult with how shitty society is turning into. not in a society where the economoy is so fucked up, that the price of a coco cola can is cheaper than water. 

dont get me wrong, every generation had its struggles and obstacles. 

thats the problem. i do not wish to exist in a reality, where suffering is prevalent. so prevalent and severe, to the point where people would wish for death. 

of course, happiness can't exist without suffering. one cant exist without the other.. honestly, if i were to state my own philosophical interpretations on that fact, id say that happiness might as well be represented as an antagonist. we want that feeling of euphoria so we can run away from the negative aspects of life. without that euphoria, we are in a state of suffering, because we are aware of that pain and its negativity. however, if there was a reality where suffering was constant and the only emotion we felt, it should be logical to assume that we wouldnt notice anything because it's just a default emotion. we'd just be indifferent to the fact that we suffer. 
i hope i explained that well, because i cant organize my thoughts into a comprehensible sentence very well. 

thats the first possibility. the second possibility states that since i am real, i must suffer. 
we all know that quote from rene descartes 
""i think therefore i am""
which generally contextualizes that if someone perceives, or questions their existence, then they are real. at least thats what i got when skim-reading through articles about his quote. 
this means that if someone is aware of their existence, then they are truly real. there needs to be consciousness in order to make their reality a valid statement. 
the fact that i am real means that i need to deal with the consequences of being conscious, which includes feeling pain and suffering. 
but why? what the hell did i do, to deserve reality? what could i have possibly done to deserve a cruel fate? 

nothing. its not cruel, at least according to a philosophy i agree with, which is nihlism. the concept that existed before consciousness is not real, therefore they cannot feel emotions such as cruelty or malice because it requires a degree of intellectual activity to have such thoughts. therefore, it isnt anyone's fault that i exist. 

so it shouldnt matter if i die. there are no consequences because there is really, nothing deep about reality itself. therefore, everyone who is conscious has freedom to write their own story. some, just decide tk throw away their survival instincts because they fucking suck, and embrace the comfort of death. 

hell, the fact that i exist implies that i have the right to die. it's free will. 

im sorry to my loved ones, by the way
im really sorry, but im tired of fighting. im tired of pretending to be happy when im actually on the verge of slitting my throat every day. 
i cant stand living. ive been having these thoughts far too long (i had suicidal thoughts ever since i was 10, i first attempted when i was 12. so far ive had 10+ attempts) and it's better for me to die. its actually probably peaceful, according to people who have been clinically dead but revived to tell the tale. 

even if i were to be a successful person, i'd only be famous after death. i'll only be recognized for my works, and never my humanity. so no, mom, dad, i wont do great shit in my life. even if i did, it wont matter. 

i sound like a fucking edgelord, dear god.

i was on risperdal once, which made me dissociate, paranoid, and panicky after a shot. then i was on xanax for 3 years, which did help, but i got off it 7 years ago. since then, it's been a battle with severe existential anxiety and dpdr—that detached, glowing, foggy feeling in my forehead and top of my head.

i (28f) dated a guy for almost 3 years. to make it easy to understand, i'll refer to my ex as sam(28m). it was a long distance relationship(i'm from the west coast and he's from the east coast). we met through a dating app and we hit it right off. the first few months was great, we had so much in common and to me it really seemed like this relationship was going to be serious. he was my first boyfriend. i held off on dating to focus on my studies and my career. he supported me throughout my masters and my career development and i helped him through major life changes that he was going through. i had always wanted a  ""first and last"" relationship. i thought i had hit the jackpot with this guy.

i travel a lot for my job. the company sends me out to different states to attend conferences, conduct training, etc. and most of these conferences are held in sam's hometown. even though it was a long distance relationship, we would see each other more often because of the convenience of my job. i would stay in his apartment whenever i was there and he would also fly to my hometown and stay at my apartment for weeks at a time. everything was great until after our 1st anniversary. 

he started to become distant. during this time, i hadn't been able to fly down to his hometown because i was busy with training in our office. i never made him feel like he was less of a priority and i would always text him throughout the day. whenever we were together, i basically did what i thought a good girlfriend should do(i've never had experience so i just did what i thought was right like giving him attention, making him feel seen and heard, being patient with him, allowing him to go out with his friends whenever he wanted to, etc.) i really thought i was doing good for my first relationship. until he asked for a break. i admit, i did beg and cry when he asked for it but ultimately, i couldn't do anything and decided to accept it and move on. i was heartbroken but i poured my attention to my job and eventually got promoted.

2 months passed and sam reached out to me with a really really long message. basically he was apologizing for the sudden breakup without an explanation and he explained why he had to do it and that he loved me and he knew that he was wrong but if i wasn't willing to give him a 2nd chance then he would just settle for us being friends because he said i was a great person and a great friend. my trust was ruined at this point but i wasn't really mad at him and i admit that i still loved him so we decided on starting all over again but as friends. to make it short, we ended up dating again after 5 months.

i really thought this was like his redemption arc and he'd be more attentive and loving towards me and he was...for like 3 months and then he started being distant again. i slowly noticed a pattern with his actions. i asked a close friend of mine for some advice and she told me that sam was breadcrumbing(?) me. he would give me attention and love and then suddenly stop so i would start to beg for more.

after our second anniversary(we still kept our old anniversary date and celebrated that as our anniversary) he suddenly ghosted me. no message, no nothing. i was blocked on everything. i couldn't call or text his number. nada. this time, i wasn't as heartbroken. instead, i was contemplating what the heck this man was trying to do to me. he was toying with my emotions when all i had given him was genuine love. it started to piss me off but again, i didn't want to do anything about it and just moved on.

3 months go by and sam was back in my dms. this time with a different message. he wasn't asking for another chance or anything, he was just explaining why he had done it. basically it was all half-assed explanations(he was leaving his old job and he got busy with a new job and he didn't have time for me so he thought he'd get everything done before he would fly down to my hometown and reconcile) he asked if he could come and visit me and we can talk it all out. during this time, i had found out that during the time we were together, he was cheating on me and apparently it didn't work out with that girl so he came back to me. he had done this in the past as well(all of this was confirmed by a friend i had who moved to his hometown who became my source of intel) 

this is when i felt a switch turn on in my head. i knew what he was doing and instead of turning him down and just move on, i wanted him to feel the way i felt when he did all of this to me. i told him he could come and visit me and that i'll be waiting for him. at this point, i knew he knew i was acting out of character. he asked me if i was really okay with meeting him and talking things out and i said yes. a week passed and he actually flew down to my hometown and he had the audacity to come to my apartment and stay with me for 3 weeks. i welcomed him with open arms nonetheless. 

we talked and he apologized over and over again. he kept insisting that he wasn't good enough for me to give him another chance. he kept saying how much of an asshole he was for doing that to me and i never deserved all of that. he would understand if i wanted to throw him out right then and there. i hugged him and told him that i still loved him and that i wanted to make things work between us. he was taken aback because he wasn't expecting this reaction from me. i told him that he was the only one who understood me and i never felt this kind of attraction with anyone else. he hugged me back and told me how much he missed me and how much he loved me. we agreed to spend the 3 weeks together ""rebuilding our relationship"". 

for the next 3 weeks, i treated him like a king. showering him with love and affection. cooking for him, making all of his favorite dishes. we would go out on dates almost every night. i bought him video games that he liked and i would let him play all night while i sit next to him and just watch him enjoy himself. i (pardon my language) f*cked his brains out every night. he would whisper words of love for me after we did the deed and it was exactly what i wanted.

3 weeks was up and he had to fly back to his hometown. he couldn't keep his hands away from me the day before he had to leave. he kept telling me how much he wanted to stay and live with me. i played right into his fantasy and told him i wanted that as well (i, in fact, did not want that at all). i told him i'd come and visit him the next chance i get. when he left, i felt relieved. faking everything was exhausting but i wasn't done yet.

we kept texting, calling and facetiming each other when he got back to his hometown. something he rarely wanted to do with me before. i wanted to drive him mad, i wanted to drive him crazy like what he almost made me went through. i started ignoring his texts and calls until he became desperate. i would make up some excuse about being super busy and that i would make it up to him. next thing i did was to randomly post pictures of me and some male coworkers that would make it seem like we were on a date. i would post them on my ig story and quickly deleting it once sam had viewed them. he would blow up and start calling me asking who that was and where i was. i would tell him ""what are you talking about babe? i've been so busy i haven't even gotten the time to be on my phone"" which is an obvious blatant lie but the more i did it, the more sam started to question himself. started to question if he truly saw what he saw. he would apologize and admit that he missed me so much and wanted to be with me as soon as possible. he was slowly becoming obsessed with me and that's what i was hoping for.

it got to the point where it drove him mad whenever i started to act coldly towards him. i would always play dumb whenever he would ask why i was acting so cold. he would ask if i wanted to break up with him and i would say ""why would i do that? you're the only one for me"". whenever i would say those words, his face would go from relieved to worried in a split second. i kept doing all of these for months until the slight thought of me leaving him drove him insane. he once flew down to my hometown unannounced when i was acting cold towards him. he banged on my door at 10pm and he only brought a backpack with him with a few clothes. he clung to me that night and obviously i reassured him that i wasn't going to leave him and i once again (excuse my french) gave him a f*cking of a lifetime. he had to fly home the next day and i reassured him that i'll always be here for him.

little did he know that i'll be temporarily sent to europe for a month long training and i'm not planning on contacting him. the moment i leave, i'm blocking him on everything and i'll be deleting all of my social media accounts.

am i a psycho? probably.

update: i said i was gonna post an update after a week but like someone had said in the comments, we never really know what people can do.

i have a ring camera set up on my door. on the second day that i left, i was curious if anyone had been by my apartment. to my surprise(not really) i saw a frantic sam banging on my door. based on the footage that i saw, he was there for a good 2 hours before a neighbor went out and talked to him.

this might have been my downfall since i wasn't really expecting my neighbor to actually talk to sam while he was there. i'm friendly with my neighbors and the day i had left, i had blabbed that i was heading to europe for work-related stuff since they asked why i had luggage with me. it seems like they told sam about it and he immediately ran out of my apartment building. i honestly wasn't expecting him to do anything since he had the audacity to cheat so maybe he'd just call it quits and move on. nope. i was wrong.

we had a common friend, let's just call her vee. well we didn't really talk to vee much because she was busy with her life(sahm with 3 kids) since we didn't talk to her much, i forgot to tell her about what happened with sam(i had informed my friends and all our common friends to not give sam my number or to not contact me when he asks) and when she called me, i answered not knowing it was gonna be sam.

he asked where i was in a very frantic voice, almost on the verge of tears. i very plainly said ""oh you really don't need to know right? like how i didn't need to know about lisa(the girl he cheated on me with)"" he was very quiet for a while and i thought about hanging up. he immediately went on an apology overload. giving all the cliche reasons like he made a mistake, it wasn't like that, etc.

he was begging for another chance, a chance to finally make things right. he was really serious about us and he wanted to fight for our relationship. i just replied with ""maybe in the next life bud"" and i hung up. i blocked vee's number for the meantime until i was sure he had left. this morning i had unblocked vee's number and i received a text saying ""i'm not giving up on us"" i ignored it and went on with my day.

the update is kinda anticlimactic but i'm sure he got my message. and to answer some of the comments, yes i know its a waste of time doing this whole revenge thing but i don't really care, it was totally worth it for me.

update 2: this ah showed up in germany and now won't stop blowing up my phone.

this man found a way to track me down and is now here in germany and trying to find me. he got a hold of me once and told me his plan and i blew up at him and said ""you cheated!! why can't you just go and be with that other woman or be with someone else?? i already made it clear that you're out of my life!!"" he insisted he didn't cheat and that he wants to ""fix"" our relationship.

on one hand, i completely underestimated what he can do but on the other hand, i'm draining his bank account with what he's doing. do i regret it? nope.",0

 my coworker confirmed the guy doesn't take care of the cat nor give her any attention, and uses all his time and money just gaming all day and night. so, he tried telling the guy i would adopt or buy the cat from him since he clearly doesn't care nor take care of her, but tried lying and saying he changes her things everyday and takes care of her every day as well which is a complete lie.
he moves out on the 15th, and my coworker is gonna help me steal/rescue the cat on the 13th while the guy is at work and leave the door slightly cracked so it looks like the cat got out. 

i feel like the means justify the action in this scenario, that cat deserves an owner who will take actual care of her.

i'm extremely tired of this shit life, like really, really want to get out and away from it and end it, at some point, after i finish some earthly business in the following year, give or take some months maybe.
won't get into more details cause there's no point, it's too much to say..
i just need someone to help me with some advice and proper medical calculations.

m 34, h 185 cm, @ 80 kilos, fit-ish enough cause i workout and have a very good hr, i've been allergic for more than 15 years already to nsaids like aspirin, ibu/keto/everyfuckingprofen and everything related to those and many more, plus to metamizole as well, which in my country for example it's called algocalmin.

chatgpt didn't want to help me with proper info's obviously about anything :)), so i need someone with medical/pharmaceutical experience to help a brother out ;).

i'll give a small example, if i take 200 mg of ibuprofen, my asthma triggers and i get shortness of breath and feel like suffocating for at least 1 hour or 2, unless i use ventolin or other similar sprays to get back to normal.

the question is now: how many pills and in what combinations could i try things so i can just cause myself a full bronchi blockage and just suffocate to death? preferably not to get a fail from it and remain with internal damage to my organs or anything, i never did this so i'd like for it to be my first and last try and be gone for good.
would a mix of some alcohol with aprox. 100 pills blended of everything would help more? 

i don't need anyone to try and talk me out of it, so please, i really need proper advice of what to mix and take, cause these are free pills to buy from pharmacies without medical rec or papers.. so please help me out.

thank you all in advance. :)",0

post_05094,"i'm scared of going on my dream trip with my family hi everyone, 

i 30(f) was an exchange student in 2008-2009 in poland.  i went because my grandmother was 100% polish and to be transparent my other 3 ""grandparents"" didn't have a lot of interest in a relationship with me.  my grandmother was a wonderful goofy person who made me laugh more ways than i can remember.   i remember calling her from poland on her birthday and singing her happy birthday in polish and her crying on the phone.  my grandma was not an emotional person and thinking back on it makes me lose it. 

gummy (my nickname for my grandmother) passed in 2015.  it was sudden and unexpected.  i still can't go to funerals, i cry just thinking about them.  i'm hyper emotional and have learned to not be ashamed of it, this is just who i am. 

my mom (gummy's daughter) is the one who is polish.  i've been wanting for the past 16 years to get my mom to poland.  i always thought it would probably just be me and her because if i were to be able to afford it i couldnt imagine having the financials to bring my dad. on top of that we've had tons of health issues plague the family that would have postponed trips anyway. 

well on thanksgiving day y'all it happened.  my dad got on a call with me in psn (he's in another state)  and said he had 2 things to discuss.  a visit to me (obviously exciting) and then dropped an absolute miracle in my lap.  he said he was flying my nuclear family to poland.  when i tell y'all i hyperventilated and sobbed.  i can't believe it's finally happening. 

here's the thing. i am terrified.  i'm working out trying to build more strength in my legs but i've gained 100 pounds since i was last there due to issues with my legs.  what if i see old friends and they see how far i am now and lose respect for me? but also i haven't seen them in almost 20 years so why do i care? 

  i'm also scared i won't be able to recognize anything which is so unreasonable, it's been almost 20 years.  why am i like this? i've had dreams over the years of going back and not knowing where things are and making wrong turns.  i'm so scared. 

and on top of it all the mourning.  the absolute heartbreak of not being able to call and tell my grandmother about it.  she's been gone 10 years this year and the more excited i get for this trip the more scared i get, then ashamed, then i hyper fixate on google maps trying to find places i used to know, then i worry about if my legs will hold up to walk that distance.   i'm spiraling and idk.  i just need to hear that this is going to be great and i'm making good steps toward this trip and that even though i'm fat now that won't matter. 

thanks for reading my meltdown, if you made it this far. 

you are loved, you are cherished, you are important.  ",0

post_05516,"i still think of my ex everyday 3 years later i think something is wrong with me.  we were never officially boyfriend girlfriend but for all intents and purposes we were in a serious situationship for about 3 years on and off. he wanted a relationship and i wasn't ready for that yet because of my insecurities. he ended things with me 2 times. the first time he came back after 9 months saying he left because it wasn't going anywhere but he still had feelings for me. at the time he told me if we were going to see each other again it was going to be a relationship. we started seeing each other again but i never brought the relationship thing up. 4 months later he leaves me again saying he ran into a girl he fell in love with a long time ago and realized that he didn't feel like he was falling in love with me, also that he knew liked me but felt like it was just lust the last time we hung out. fast forward 6 months later, i find out via an instagram that he created (he was never into instagram) that he's in a full flung serious relationship with a completely different girl who i know for a fact he had started talking right before we ended. this all happened in 2022 and to my knowledge, they are still together and last summer had a ""serious life event"" (quoting my sister here). neither of us has reached out since. 

on the other hand, i had to deal with the betrayal of him lying about why he left me, and being surprised to see how quickly he moved on; on top of all the rejection and ugly feelings you feel when someone breaks up with you. also, i felt like shit because he seemingly has been living the good life and me on the other hand has yet to find the loml and have dealt with other hardships that have made me more depressed on top of the breakup. i became bitter seeing how differently our lives turned out and secretly hoped they'd break up or at least that he'd get some sort of karma for breaking my heart. instead it seemed like he was just rewarded for it. 

i'm embarrassed to admit that i still think of him everyday and wonder if he ever thinks about me. sometimes i want him still, sometimes i'm glad he's out of my life, but somehow my mind finds a path to him every damn day! i am unable to feel anything real for other guys and it's scaring me now. don't get me wrong, i can find other guys attractive and even have a work crush right now; but deep feelings like i had for him? i haven't met any guy in 3 years that i've felt that for. sometimes i still cry when i think about how easily he found someone and how it's a successful relationship vs how lonely it's been for me. he literally just went from me to her so i'm sure he never even felt any grief or loneliness. i know i'm not perfect but this experience has made me feel like i'm being punished for something, like it's honestly torture. i'm scared that i'll never stop thinking of him. i know i screwed up by not taking his want for a relationship more seriously but at the time i just was not ready for that. to be honest, i'm shy and don't put myself out there much and this guy was my first love. obviously i know that's a huge factor for why i still think about him but i just hate that he's still on my mind after all this time and had to let it out.

post_02862,"depression/suicidal ideation and tarot had gotten into tarot readings a while ago, at the bottom of a pit and wanted some light...
asked, ""should i kill myself?"" i got the hanged man card, basically meaning ""no"". did another reading, ""will everything be okay?"" keep getting positive energy cards such as the sun and temperance. 

lately, whenever i ask, will i kill myself? i get temperance, a cautious yes. 

don't know if anyone else here is into tarot or spirituality, but, i keep getting these cards saying i'll be okay, and reconsider suicide...

my brain still wants it, i have the letters and the method ready. and a date, soon.

my dads wife sucks and he puts all his attention towards her when she's around, and i even realized that i want to kill myself more when around her

i fucked up my hair when i was cutting it (basically gave myself complete shit bangs)

(i know this doesn't matter that much but kinda does for me) found out i'm british and there is a meme of my favorite music artist (hatsune miku) saying how she hates and doesn't talk to british people so that made me really fuckin sad

had to go to the ent and learned that my hearing in my left ear is pretty bad so i am probably going to need a hearing aid in my left ear and that made me really pissed

took a depression test said it was a severe chance of me having depression so taking that as i have it

but it sucks bc 1, can't find anything to kill myself quickly and not painfully, 2, every time i grab a knife and think about doing it (yes it's painful and slow but it s the only way i can currently think of) but i always think about, ""oh my brother, whenever he goes to my dads he'll be sad,"" ""can't do that, my mom will be heartbroken and prolly also depressed,"" ""dammit, i feel too bad to put that on my friends""

post_05264,"i'm thinking of just giving up on social media i'm just so tired.. i'm an artist who started using instagram to gain followers and maybe make some money on the side at some point with commissions, but i don't have enough followers or support for that right now. my old account had at least 600 followers, but i didn't get over 10 likes on my posts, so i decided to try and start fresh since most of those followers were probably ghost followers. at this account now, i only have 202 followers, and i just feel so.. stuck. no matter what i try, how i posted, what i posted, when, or what i posted, i would be stagnant and not have anyone new.. i have accounts for 3 ocs for the helliverse, like hazbin hotel and helluva boss characters i created, and they have about the same as my regular art account does.

i know that followers don't make the artist, but it's really disheartening and makes me not want to try much anymore since my efforts have amounted to nothing. deviantart is basically dead, cara was a different app that hasn't gone anywhere for me, and now i just started a bluesky social account, and i'm not sure if it would be any better. i'm drained and starting to lose hope in my craft.. i created a drawing for myself for the first time in a while, but i still feel like it's not good enough and that i'm not good enough.

post_00451,"how do i get people to take my si seriously? hi. i'm 17, and since i was 12/13, i've had mental health issues regarding depression and anxiety, and i also have hf autism.

 when i was 13 i told the school counsellor that i had suicidal ideation, and was taken out of school and put to online school, and move in with my grandparents so i could be watched. despite this, my parents, and entire family really didn't take it seriously. i'm separated from my dad so i don't see him often, and he's not really involved, but my mum didn't believe that i was suicidal at all, and just thought i was trying to get out of school. 

after this, i'm now 17, and have struggled with depression throughout the years, however no one notices, or believes anything. they attribute my behaviours and feelings to being emotional, hormonal, or being a bad kid/person. 

i'm at the point where, i truly believe i could attempt if i find the means. how can i help them realise, and save me? i don't think they care about me enough in the first place to bother, but it's possible also that they're too afraid to let themselves believe i'm suicidal and have intentions to go through with it.

i'm also on day 17 of lexapro(escitalopram). i don't know if this is whats causing the suicidal thoughts or not, but it's getting worse, and i just wish someone would take me seriously. 

i don't know what i should say or do. i'm scared i will stress them out if i tell them, even if they don't take it seriously. so maybe i should just do it, and then they won't have to bother any longer.

post_00603,"i can't take the depression anymore, i'm losing against my head hello everybody, first of all i want to apologize because english is not a first language, there are probably some errors in the writing and i hope they are not too annoying!

i'm from argentina and i'm 31 years old, i'm a music producer.

as i wrote in the title of the post, i can't stand my life anymore, the accumulation of things means that i can't enjoy anything, not even the things that i always loved. i grew up in a very psychologically hostile family environment and with abandonment.

my father was never present and my mother seems like she was my older sister, she always destroyed my self-esteem and attacked me for the profession i chose (i suffer from a lot of physical and psychological violence all my life, especially psychological), my only mother figure in my family was my grandmother who died 15 years ago.  

since i was 13 i have been thinking about suicide (i had suicide attempts as a teenager) i feel like i can't be happy, i feel invisible and that i am of no use, i'm in a very dark place right now.

the worst thing is that i did relatively well producing music, i was able to get into good record labels and have minimal recognition but i was always the shit of the family, the lazy one who didn't study law or medicine or any type of conventional careers.

i feel very alone and as i mentioned above i don't enjoy anything, the days are just days. 

i remember having conversations with people who i thought loved me and telling them about it because at one point i really felt like i had the strength to ask for help, but the people i mentioned my problem looked at me as if i were a strange and shitty being. i will never forget the reaction of one person in particular who told me how horrible you tried to do that, how disgusting.

from that moment on i can't ask for help and i honestly don't have the strength anymore. i feel like i'm definitely losing, i've been giving away my close belongings and talking to people i haven't talked to in a long time. 

for a few years now i have had the reflex to cut my arm and make cuts that would kill myself. i have written countless suicide letters, and i'm sure that the next time i write one it will be the last. 

i was always there for everyone and no one was there for me, and i understand it, the world does not revolve around me and i am only a small being in the entire universe. nobody has to worry about me.

in a way it makes me happy that my music may have made people happy, but my end is near.

i no longer have the strength for anything, i'm loosing against my head.



thank you for taking your time to read this and i sincerely hope that everything improves in your life for real. 



i wish you all the best.

post_01593,"plans. hey everyone. i am 28f nurse here. life really has fucked me. i can't handle this pain anymore. 

i've taken care of enough failed suicide patients at the hospital. sometimes these failed suicide attempts result in them being disabled for the rest of their lives, so i guess you could say that i've learned from them. i know what i have to do to be successful which is a bullet to the head. i have been making plans on buying a gun and finally having my peace. i don't have the gun yet but i've researched on how to obtain one in my state which seems pretty straightforward. 

i'm going to utilize the next couple weeks to get my belongings, assets, accounts, and money in order to make sure that everything is easy as possible for my parents to manage. i already have made an entire ""to do"" list before i finally go, figuring out who to address in my note, ensuring beneficiaries are in place, usernames/passwords to my accounts, those types of things.

my heart is heavy. i really thought i would accomplish great things in this world. as a little girl i always thought i'd do great things and daydreamed a lot about a happy, successful life. instead i'm a lonely, failure, friendless loser. the one ""kinda"" friend i have… yeah i tried opening up as a last ditch effort and i got left on read. i tried calling my friend and he ignored me and never called back. just little shit like that that adds up. if i had a friend that needed me… man i'd drop everything for them if i knew how bad they were struggling. i'd do anything for my loved ones. it's just not the same for me. i am perpetually lonely. i try to make friends and it seems to backfire on me more often than not. that's the least of my worries though. all in all, trying to do anything in this life is just painful. even the things that used to bring me happiness… yeah. not anymore. i used to be a drummer and toured around the country a few times. really good times. i've sold most of my gear at this point and still working on selling the final last few things so my parents don't have to deal with that.

the only thing that sometimes gave me a purpose was being a nurse and caring for others - but i'm completely burnt out and hate it - and it's part of the reason that i am going. getting a degree in healthcare was one of the worst possible decisions i could've made for myself. it has truly ruined me. but that's just a piece of the puzzle. anyway, i'm gonna stop blabbering. 

i'm sorry to the rest of you who are also suffering. i feel your pain. i hope you find your peace. ",1

post_00533,"suicidal thoughts after i gave myself permanent nerve damage in my penis. around 7 months ago, i found websites and forums that promised penis size increase and attempted to do these techniques and failed horribly. i have lost so much sensitivity for no reason. everywhere on my penis has arounf 10% sensitivity left and my scrotum's sensitivity is almost all gone aswell. morning wood is super soft, erections are super soft. i'm only 19 and damaged my penis for life. i'm heading to the doctors next friday, but read all on the internet that nerve damage is permanent. in the last 7 months there have been zero improvement in my penis. i can't sleep anymore and can't tell anyone in my life because this is so embarrassing. i've dropped all my college classes except one and failed that class. this has taken a mental toll in my life and i don't think i can continue any longer. the first time i went to the doctors, they just gave me cialis, if they do it again i think i'm done with life. i can't continue life like this, every time i pee, take a shower, wake up with a weak erection, every time i walk i get reminded with the lack of sensations from my groin, i get reminded that i fucked everything up due to my insecurities. i have shut myself off from the world in the last 7 months. i just stay in bed all day or watch this livestreamer xqc which helps me forget until he ends stream.  i went dead silent in my friend's groupchat ever since this happened, i can't just pop in like i have havent been gone for little over half a year.

i know some will say ""you're an idiot for doing this"" and you are correct. i wasn't even small, i'm 6 in long with 4.3 in girth . but how can i feel good about my size when i was hit all my life with that i have a small penis stereotype because i am an asian american. the first time i was hit with that stereotype was in 5th grade i remember that girl that said i didn't have a penis because i was asian. that terrified 9 or 10 year old me. yeah and of course i get hit that stereotype in middle school as well with more stuff like i eat dog and what not. flash forward to highschool, i'm in the football locker room with my teammates, went to take a piss at the urinals, my douche of a teammate stares at my dick while pissing says i have a pencil dick and tells my other teammates and make more racist jokes. now flash forward to college during the corona virus shit. asians getting blamed and shit, i was filling up my gas and this dude yells at me ""these small dicked asians ruin everything"". i can't say shit except ""shut the fuck up bitch"". later stumbled upon penis enlargement exercises and gave myself nerve damage. your penis is fine they way it is, if it gets hard thats all you need. you shouldn't be turned down by a life partner over your penis size. i've dated 3 girls and none of them complained. i should have felt satisfied from that. if a girl denies you for your size, you dodged a massive bullet, a missile maybe.

post_05187,"everyday i get belittling comments and sly rude gestures indirectly directed at me because i explored my sexuality one night. tldr: became suicidal over exploring my sexuality

one night a few years ago i had the split second want or need to embrace my feelings of maybe being bi, my thoughts at the time were scaring me and i wasn't understanding why i was having them (later on i realised my feelings were based off trauma) and so i wanted to just try a few things, ""explore"" my body, so corny i know, to see how i liked it. 

it was late at night and so i thought in the comfort of my own room i would have the privacy to do such things, but unfortunately i couldn't have been more wrong.

after i had finished up what i had been doing, i felt this intense wave of guilt and regret for exploring myself in a way i wasn't use too before, it gave me a relief as i thought as this was my confirmation that maybe i was indeed straight.  after processing for a few minutes about what i had done and how i was feeling i left to go have a shower. once i had made it to the shower i realised i left my clothes in my room and so i had started making my way back to the room where i find the family friend that was over up near the door trying to listen in, not realising i was heading the room, he glanced towards me and with him maybe thinking it was too dark and late at night for me to see him he snuck past to quickly get to the lounge and fake sleep and act as though it never happened.

as i walked back to my room i had this bad gut wrenching feeling that i feel like this was going to be used against me, sure enough though, i never confronted them in the moment 

following weeks go by and now i have multiple ""friends"" and family of mine making jokes about me being gay or making certain ""gestures"" that only i could know what they mean because i ""used"" them on the night, as they do these things i get stares and small smirks, i know it's about me, so i finally stood up for myself.

i then began questioning every single person i knew about what they knew and if people were speaking about me, and every time i'd get the same repetitive response ""yeah sometimes, but nothing bad why"" and then i'd question that like what do you mean and it would be the same loop as to how it isn't that bad. i know it seems like maybe i was getting for far fetched and overthinking too much but i believe that there is no such thing as coincidences and after the years of manipulation and gaslighting my experience, i've come to the point where i genuinely feel like maybe i'm not good enough, maybe i am gross, maybe i should just leave. 

it's becoming to much and i don't know where to look for help, i've tried psychologists and doctors, i need something else

post_06194,"i am a gay man, and i am in love with my wife. i met my wife when we were both in high school. we grew up in the south, so me being gay wasn't exactly an option at the time. we started dating because it was a good cover for me, and she had a thing for me. i've never had much of a sex drive. i used to assume it was the pent up gay, but knowing the terms now, i'm probably on the ace spectrum. i definitely like men, but even with the hottest guys i only ever wanted it once or twice a month. 

i came out about 15 years ago, just to her. she was heartbroken, but very accepting. she asked me to still ""date"" her until i found a boyfriend, and i agreed because i did really value her as a close friend. we both agreed we would keep living together, go out together with friends, the usual, but obviously would start actively seeing other people. i met a few guys, but none that i really wanted to hold down, and she was happy enough coming home to me after whatever escapades she got up to. 

then she got pregnant. everyone assumed i was the father, and all i've ever wanted was to be a stay at home dad. i sat her down and told her that if she wanted, i'd marry her if she was the breadwinner. i'd take care of the baby, the house, all that stuff, if she supported us. i explained that i would want the same arrangement we had now, but that this way she could count on having childcare, and i would have the life i've always wanted. 

she agreed, and we got married in august 2011. ""our"" daughter was born january of 2012. life was exactly what i wanted and expected. we didn't have tons of money, but we got by fine. 

about 5 years ago, we got drunk, and slept together. for the first time in our relationship, we were actually physical. i woke up the next morning and was shocked at how much i didn't regret it. it was definitely not something i would have done sober, but it made her so happy it just made me happy. it was... fine. ultimately, it wasn't some horrid, gross thing. i wasn't into it, but it really made her happy, and that made me happy. 

she asked me about it, and i told her the truth. i am gay, i am not attracted to her, but i *do* love her. if a physical relationship would make her that happy, i could do that. after all, how many women are with men they aren't attracted to? 

when the pandemic hit, we had another talk. we discussed that seeing other partners wasn't safe, and for the time being, and the safety of our daughter, we should stop doing so. 

*our* second daughter was born 3 days ago. there were some complications, and i realized i didn't just love my wife, i was *in* love with her. 

i have a perfect wife, a perfect little white picket fence life, and two beautiful daughters. i am a gay man, and i am in love with my wife.",0
post_02737,"i don't see a future for myself like this i wish i could close my eyes and just die in my sleep. everything's awful. nothing ever goes well for me and i'm starting to despise everything and everyone around me except maybe my cats. whenever something mildly great happens, something 10 times worse happens right after.

 i can't take care of myself no matter how hard i try. i'm too sensitive and that ruins my interactions with everyne. my grades suck and i can't get myself to study. i'm ugly, no matter how hard i try to become pretty, and now i'm eating a lot and i'm becoming chubbier and chubbier and i'm getting the urge to stick two fingers in my throat and spit all of it out. i keep my head down when i'm walking and now i almost have a permanent shrimp posture. i ruined my curls to straighten my hair and look more girly so people would like me more but i still get made fun of everyday by all of my clasmates. even my fugliest classmates shuts the door in my face after holding it open from everyone else. people pick the disabled guy over me when they have to make the volleyball teams and sometimes, when they make groups for projects, they ""forget"" to add me and the teacher has to squeeze me in a group with someone and it's super awkward. 

they throw volleyballs at me on purpose and then pretend to be apologetic while their friends giggle behind them. it hurts and it's embarrassing.

when i walk behind my classmates they giggle and say ""look who's behind us"". they make dirty rumors about me and it's embarrassing to walk into class when you know they've been saying stuff like that about you, while when i'm actually in class it's like i don't exist. i feel like a waste of space and air.

it's always been like this since forever, it'll never change. i have 0 social skills because of it and it's killing me. i feel like i'm going to die alone.

my parents don't care about my health, they only care about my shitty grades. my dad only recently stopped beating me up over them and that's embarrassing.

the only thing that was keeping me going were videogames and that's embarrassing as fuck. lately not even those are helping at all.

i really don't get why i'm living at this point. i've been considering suicide for i don't know how long and i've even attempted to overdose just to throw up and get sick like two times. i can't make my parents proud. i can't make myself proud. i can't make anyone proud because nobody wants me in the first place, i've never had a best friend in my whole life, or a friend who'd stick to me and tell me ""happy new year"" or a family that'd reach out.

the only thing actually keeping me here is one of my two cats, but i don't know how much more i can take. everything keeps getting worse as time goes by.",1

my family's luck isn't great and our medical history is extensive, but due to money and time, we opted for at-home infusions. i was taught how to do it for her because she can't (the iv is in her hand and makes it difficult to maneuver), and i am just absolutely terrified that despite my efforts, i am going to *ill her.

the thought is petrifying, because i know how lethal air bubbles can be / are in an iv line, and i'm so scared.

post_04991,"my parents had sex in the same room as me while was awake. hey ! so after reading a bunch of similar posts on here i thought i'd share my story. basically when i was young me and my mom lived with my grandma and then she met my dad and they started dating. me and my mom shared a room and i have this vivid memory of my dad getting into bed with me and my mom and them basically having sex when i was around 4 years old. at the time i didn't understand but i remember me basically being uncomfortable and my dad getting angry cause i was misbehaving when obviously i didn't trust him and he was sleeping in our bed , only to find out they were fucking. 

later on we moved into an apartment we shared which had only one bedroom but i slept on one bed and they slept on another. i had terrible insomnia as kid and i still do where i can't fall asleep sometimes. but i distinctly remember hearing my parents  having sex and hearing moaning noises which at the time i didn't understand and was weirded out by. the rest is vague but i remember locking myself in the room as a kid and stripping myself naked and trying to recreate the way they had sex. like i would hump pillows and repeat whatever my dad said to mom. thinking about it now makes me sick and i can't believe to this day this happened. one time they walked in one me doing this and my dad basically started hitting me and shaming me and when they asked for an explanation i couldn't give it to them. now my mom later bought a computer because i was entering kindergarten. i was basically 5 years old looking up videos on pornhub because of my exposure to sex i was very curious and looked at stuff i definitely should have not been seeing. 

fastforward to 2012 and my parents moved i to a house with two rooms and me and my sister shared one room and i they had their own room. needless to say at age 13 i began masturbating and basically have been hypersexual since. to make matters worse my parents did this shit again. it happened two times. they decided to give the room to my grandmother from my dad's side who was visiting and my sister slept with me in my bed while they slept in my sister's bed. my sister was sound asleep but again they were having sex and i could hear it everything, the moaning, the bed shaking, them doing it on my sisters bed disgusted me then and it still disgusts me now. the other time it was reversed and i was with my sister in her bed while they were in mine again fucking all night. i was so tired and couldn't sleep that night because it was annoying. i always pretended i was asleep and not listening even though i was. i never brought it to their attention because i didn't want to make things awkward. ive always found it weird how i have weird relationship with sex but i think now the puzzle pieces are coming together. btw i am currently 20, and still a virgin. but yeah that's it this is my story, pretty fucked up not mentioned the fact that my dad was/is still an abusive alcoholic so that definitely didn't help. 


edit : forgot to mention but i think i may have maladaptive daydreaming but am unsure if it was because of this or from the abuse at the hands of my father. the man would beat the shit out of me, to the point where i had red marks from the belt and my mom would put vick's vapor rub and vaseline to cover/heal it. my mom would abuse me too she would grab me by the hair and ears and drag me across the floor.",0

post_06657,"nsfw. tw imagine your job was having to fuck someone you work with, that you absolutely hate, and that same person fucking you hates your guts too . this was my job description as a hardcore porn actor. whoever invented the term ""hate fuck"" was looking for a politically correct way to say rape


hate fucking is basically what we do for hardcore extreme porn film shoots because there's zero chemistry, between you and the other actors. zero


the only chemistry that's working in this scenario is the overdose of lube poured in all your orifaces that's supposed to act as a buffer while your holes are being tested to their absolute limits of their tensile strengths. 


the only chemistry that's working is the injectable viagra that's pulsing through my costars veins like an inflammatory poison to the point his/their dick(s) painfully balloons up like a deformed blimp. 


the only other chemistry that's working is the overdose of endorphins from the superdose of cocaine or opioids or amphetamines or ativan you took beforehand that's flooding your neurotransmitters to help you numb the violations, to trick your mind that the slaps, the spitting, the punches, the choking, the unwanted thrusts, the tears and pain are mere tickles or itches, that's the only chemistry that's happening. 


you can beg your agent till you're blue in the face that you won't work with certain guys in this business because you got creeped by their vibe, because they called you a dumb b, because they tried following you home, because they kept harassing you to go out with them even when you said no because he's old enough to be your dad's age and also an asshole that drugs all the new girls when he gets them alone. 


even if your contract stipulates you absolutely won't work with certain actors, as a new or young talent they give zero fucks about your boundaries and guess who you end up having to fuck or as they say ""coordinate with"" once you show up to the shoot? 


sometimes you show up and it's 3 or 4 guys you hate are intimidated by or have very bad vibes with! no one gives you the heads up, no nothing, all thanks to the director wanting to create a certain ""edgy mood"" today


and if you even think about backing out of the shoot, that's it! you'll be guilt tripped insane about how much money, how much time you've wasted on the filming, the crew, the set, the catering etc. your contracts, your upcoming gigs or pay any outstanding pay you would be expecting will be cancelled and the directors and pa's will be hell bent on smearing your reputation as a new actress. this is bullying and harassment porn industry style and it is rampant and brutal just like the way they treat your body! 


why do you think it looks so easy, so realistic for some of these actors to choke slap and abuse their costars? it's because they're not acting. 

the  extreme and hardcore directors purposely put actors who dislike each other for that anti chemistry.


 the ""hate fuck"" is such a popular vibe in this industry and it's terrifying to be looking straight into the eyes of someone who's monstrously intimidating and who hates every fiber of your being as they violate your body every way possible. 


 the directors don't care that the guy(s) you're going to be fucking for the next 12 hours kept trying to creep on you at the club or kept talking to you like a piece of shit off camera, or followed you to the bathroom between takes and rest times to try and surprise fuck or assault you because he can't handle his viagra/coke combination peaking and has the nerve to think because you have a vagina it's your job to submit to him 


the director only cares that whoever is watching his film of me, me getting choked, me being spat on,me getting skeeted on, me being gaped by these 4 guys who hate me, gets their empty, meaningless fix from this brutal video documentation of my abuse masquerading as ""edgy"" hardcore entertainment.

now that i am at a healthy weight, no one talks to me, people seem agitated by me in public, men are hostile towards me, and my youtube subscribers are steadily dropping.   
even if other people did not exist, i can hardly bear to even be cognisant of my face. i want to help people and be a positive force in this world but it is legitimately impossible when i look like this. nobody wants love or comfort from someone this fucking disgusting.   
i have already spent $10,000 on plastic surgery, and even tried to cut off my face in a psychotic state but nothing ever fucking works. i cannot stand to live like this. i don't have any more money for plastic surgery and every moment is agony knowing that i am so hideous. i will never be loved, i will never be wanted, i will never be seen in a positive way, just my face existing causes harm to the world.",1
post_04489,"in just over a month my anxiety is down from 11/10 to 1/10. cutting out all caffeine took me to a 8/10, still panicking and always on edge. 

50 mg zoloft took away my panic attacks and brought me to around a 5/10 (i still wasn't happy but it literally changed my life, i didn't spiral anymore) acceptance/ and claire weekes method was used to fight back now that i could because of the zoloft.


focusing on eating healthy whole foods, sleeping, and exercising has all but finished my anxiety.

post_05957,"my rapist is dead because of me i was 8 and he was 28-30 (can't remember) after it happened my mom beat him so bad he couldn't work, but he never went to the police.

last i knew he was homeless and/or dead so i started to open up about what happened. i told one person his name and what he used to look like because he asked.

that friend put it around (without my name) and it got to the community he was staying with, one of the men had a daughter who died young so he murdered him, in broad daylight and no one stopped him.

he's dead and i'm happy about it, i don't care that he had family. he wasn't given a grave so i can't visit him but i know if he's watching he hates me.

i'm the reason he's dead and i'll hold that forever, not to feel guilty but as an accomplishment almost.",0
post_06135,"my co-worker killed herself we all just worked with her over the weekend. she had a dark sense of humor, so we didn't think anything of it when she joked that life wasn't worth living during her shifts. and then monday she was just gone.

no one knows how to respond to it. she worked with us for a year.

i really don't know how to process it; none of us do. so we just stay as busy as possible, and we don't really talk about it. i don't know if any of us know how to, so we just don't.

i can tell you that she was way too young. she had a starbucks addiction. she listened to a lot of the 1975. she was saving everything she had for an apartment. she had two parents who loved her. she could make any of us laugh with her out-of-the-blue comments. i was trying to set her up with my brother, because she said something one day that made me think ""he would love her sense of humor.""

and now she's just gone. and when i left on saturday, i just snuck out the back door so no one would ask me to do anything else. i didn't say goodbye to her.

i know she probably wasn't thinking about us in her final moments, but she is all i can think about now.

i guess what i would tell anyone now who's struggling is that you may not think people care about you, but there are so many people who are going to miss you when you're gone.

**edit: i wasn't really expecting this kind of response, so i'm a bit overwhelmed. there are so many responses, comments, and messages i've gotten with others sharing their own personal experiences, from both perspectives, and i'm reading through all of it. thank you to everyone, truly, no matter what perspective you have. i'm so sorry so many of you have lost, and so many others have worn the other shoe.** 

**the biggest takeaway for me, and hopefully for anyone reading this edit, is that if you're struggling, please reach out. tell a friend. make a post. whatever it takes. the amount of strangers in the world who are willing to just sit and listen to you is absolutely outstanding.** ",0
post_05376,"my parents are lying: i know i'm adopted update: im adopted. i mostly found out through 23andme. i first did the test on myself 2 months ago, and it came back with a completely different family line. i was so freaked out, because i had honestly been suspicious from the start, so i confronted my parents. unfortunately, they continued to lie to me. another red flag is my parents had been completely against me getting the test even to begin with. 

to settle the matter, i took advice from offmychest (see my last post) and my brother did the test right after my results came back. his results came in yesterday, and i saw that we had a different maternal haplop. this means we are not related by mother. his family tree also did not match mine or my parents. my parents were upset when they had found out my brother got the test and wanted me to shut the test down, but i did not want to do that until i at least saw his results first, and i did in fact make sure i was first to see them before he did. when i saw the shocking results, i then paused the account, essentially, until i at least could figure this out with my parents.

i confronted my parents, again, and they finally told the truth. long story short: they were infertile and they adopted me and my brother from teen moms after a failed round of ivf. i won't get into the details, but the story of both me and my brother's adoption honestly explains so much of my life, it's crazy. 

i found my birth mom immediately because i had already been talking to my cousin and i said my bio mom's name and she recognized it immediately. i sent her a message, and it turns out i have so many other half siblings, just on my mom's side! i have been talking to my half sister who is pretty close in age to me as well. they all said they were waiting for this moment their entire life and said so many sweet things and i literally cried throughout the day it was so emotional! so i am going to keep talking to them and see where things go. hopefully we can become close eventually. 

despite all this, and all the lies and bullshit where my entire family knew about this and lied my entire childhood and adult life, and despite the fact that i'm not happy with my parents, they are still my parents. i feel awkward on the etiquette of names for my bio mom, and i do hope i can become close with her, but my mom is always going to be my adoptive mom. weirdly enough, this almost affirms that they really, truly, wanted me in a weird way. i know deep down my mom is worried she would be replaced, or have competition for the role of mom and that's part of the reason they didn't tell me. but that's definitely not true. it would be lovely to connect with my family of origin and have them be part of my close family though, and i am excited about the possibilities but also trying to keep my expectations low. 

i didn't have finding out i'm truly adopted at 30 years old and meeting my birth family on my 2025 bingo card, but i'm here for it and it's actually become more and more positive of an experience! ",0

post_02574,"i'm tired of people's shitty advice how tf can be people say that so confidently. it's so ignorant to say that. and i'm so fucking hypocritical cause i'd say the same shit if my friend was ever going through something. is there actually any real advice to say to someone. i'd like to think of myself as a good with words but i can't think of anything to say to myself. all this ""advice"" doesn't work. ""get in the gym"". ""go out with friends"". ""try to meet new people"". "" just try being happy"". at some point that shit is just annoying to read( no one has ever told me this because no one chance i'd tell someone about how much i hate myself). another one is ""just talk to someone"". i've done some research into this because i truly want to be not hate life. but everything everywhere gives out the same bullshit. i'm starting to think maybe there is no cure. maybe this is just how it is. which is really shit. i've hated being me for about 8 years now. i'm only 21. that's over a third of my life and i barely remember life before i started feeling this way, so it feels like it's been my whole life. my main issue is my fear of being judged or disliked. how do i even get that. is that something you're born with. is this cureable. i've seen stuff online about how just have to face it and start doing random things in public but i would literally die. if i ever embarrassed my self in public i'd probably hurt myself. so if facing it isn't really an option, what do i do. another one is overthinking, how tf do i tell my mind to shut up. the most success i've had with that was heavily drinking. that felt good for a while. i'd just get black out drunk and forget who i was. i'd be so confident. i could talk to girls. granted the next day i would hate myself even more and overthink everything i did but it was a method that worked. but then something happened. all of sudden no matter how much i drank sober me was still in control the whole time. so then i turned to getting high and that worked for a little bit aswell. didn't work aswell or for as long but it was a decent way to avoid my thoughts. but that stopped too. maybe an even stronger drug could be the method. one thing i've been thinking about recently is how 
unattractive am i actually. like i know myself. i'm not good looking by any means and i'm pretty short(about 5'8). i'm definitely not in perfect shape. but like am in underestimating how bad i actually am. like i've been on tinder for 3 years and had maybe 5 replies. and i'm pretty sure 1 was a bot, which unironically is the high point of the last couple months of my life. for like a solid week i had a little hope that maybe i could find a girl to like me. that felt pretty good. but everyone i know bar maybe 1 person is very capable of getting women so like am i legitimately just a 1/10. that's pretty shit but like surely my friends would have told me. surely someone would have said something. last time i tried ""just being confident"" and approaching girls i had 3 girls in a row tell me they have no socials at all. that was pretty embarrassing. and like i wasn't being a creep in the way i was approaching them, atleast i think i wasn't. people always say ""they're just people"". so i just try to talk to them like a regular people. i try to start regular conversations with girls but it's like i can tell they don't want to talk to me and that absolutely nothing against them. like i said earlier, whatever issue it is, it's my fault at the end of the day. but it still hurts. it's not like i'm super drunk when i'm trying to talk to girls or i'm bothering them loads. i'll just go up and try to start a conversation. maybe about the music that's being played. maybe about the club. maybe pay them a compliment and try not to be too generic with it. none of it works. i know the club is probably a shit place to try to meet someone but like where else is there. would a bar not just be the same. no way i'd do that in the gym cause that seems invasive. on the street seems creepy. in class seems weird. i don't think the place actually matters and it's more just something wrong with me. i know all this but it still just hurts. and when you've been hurting for as long as you remember it's really hard to keep going. i feel so selfish and self centred saying this but i feel like if i killed myself my brother would be really depressed. and i think he might already be on his way and he's only 12. but he's had a rough school experience. i think he might be a bit neuro divergent. but my family isn't the type to believe in that which sounds stupid as fuck but they just wouldn't want to accept something like that. i see a lot of myself in him which is just an awful feeling and i try to give him advice and let him know i'm there for him. but like i don't believe any of this advice is real anyway so what's the point. maybe it's genetic. i saw something that said you can be more susceptible to mental illness if someone in your family had it so maybe that's the case. i say all this to ask is there any real advice. even if it's an unhealthy way to deal with them. it can be a drug. idrc. as long as it helps",1

i dated a few people who made me feel utterly alone. they didn't actually like me for me but they were just afraid of being alone. i tried really hard to connect with people and form friendships, i was the one always reaching out and being the shoulder to cry on, the support system, yet i was forgotten and abandoned as soon as i needed help.

now here comes the part which is the reason i'm posting this here: i'm really scared that i'm somehow subconsciously faking my bad vision, and i never needed glasses all along. the glasses help my vision, but i still have this nagging at the back of my head which is making me feel like a bad person, but i never ever would fake something like that ofc. this all is making me really anxious for the appointment.

i work in medical research academia at one of the top universities in the u.s. my passion lies in a niche field of neuro translational medical research. i've been collaborating with an instructor on a novel project that could save lives, but his repeated inappropriate behavior has made my work environment deeply uncomfortable.


timeline of inappropriate behavior:


summer 2023:
	•	began collaborating with the instructor on niche research. all initial conversations were strictly professional and focused on advancing the research.


january 2024:


	•	received a christmas gift from him, which i politely thanked him for but found odd.
	•	he began shifting conversations to personal topics, including his disappointing love life.
	•	during a meeting, i deliberately sat across the room, but when we moved to a new meeting space, he chose to sit next to me. i placed my backpack between us to maintain boundaries.
	•	he asked intrusive questions, such as, ""oh, you're dating? are you seeing other people?"" after i mentioned a boyfriend to set clear boundaries.


escalation of behavior:


	•	inappropriate texts and comments:
	•	texted me saying, ""oh, we'll have a meeting on valentine's day ;)"" which made me uncomfortable.
	•	discussed his hinge dating preferences (20-30 age range, despite being in his late 30s) and unsolicitedly shared, ""single moms are too loose down there,"" after i asked a naïve follow-up question.


physical boundary violations:


	•	while i was troubleshooting a malfunctioning machine learning program and visibly frustrated, he caressed my shoulder and said, ""it's okay."" i immediately shook his hand off and felt deeply uncomfortable.


retaliation and sabotage:


	•	promised to mentor me for a graduate fellowship but withdrew support after i repeatedly referenced my ""boyfriend,"" causing me to miss a major opportunity.
	•	suggested we ""split lodging"" at conferences, making me so uncomfortable that i declined opportunities to present my work.
	•	excluded me and a supportive coworker from papers and patents that we worked hard on, despite his earlier promises.


ongoing aggression:


	•	continues to request in-person meetings despite my refusals and limits my access to research papers and potential publications.
	•	frequently asks intrusive questions about my future plans, making me fearful that he may try to follow me to my next institution.

why i haven't reported:


	•	the research is groundbreaking and has significant potential, but i fear losing access to the data and damaging my career in this niche field where everyone knows each other.


i feel trapped and unsure if his behavior is ""serious enough"" to report, but his actions have left me feeling anxious, disheartened, and stuck.

i'm worried it's actually not that bad/what he's doing isn't really wrong and i'm making this up.",0

dear everyone,  
  
i am writing to let you know i am reading each and every single one of your comments. i made this post because i saw many posts talking about how scared folks are. truth be told, i am scared too. i'm scared everyday. that's life with anxiety. sometimes it is really small and it feels like i can just ""ignore"" it and put it in my back pocket, and sometimes it is really huge and like a gigantic elephant stomping around in my brain.  
  
i recognize the tendency in myself to get caught up in negative feedback loops (including obsessively reading about horrible things and obsessing over current events) and decided i would post something somewhat different for us because sometimes, just being honest, coming to /r/anxiety can leave me feeling a bit more anxious, lol.  
  
whatever the case, i want to thank you all once again for taking the time to share your thoughts and feelings. it is good to know we're not alone. there are so many of us out there who want to see good things come out in the world. i want to share a passage that is comforting to me when things become difficult, and hope maybe it will be of some small comfort to y'all as well.  
  
>""the life of man is a long march through the night, surrounded by invisible foes, tortured by weariness and pain, towards a goal that few can hope to reach, and where none may tarry long. one by one, as they march, our comrades vanish from our sight, seized by the silent orders of omnipotent death. very brief is the time in which we can help them, in which their happiness or misery is decided. be it ours to shed sunshine on their path, to lighten their sorrows by the balm of sympathy, to give them the pure joy of a never-tiring affection, to strengthen failing courage, to instil faith in hours of despair. let us not weigh in grudging scales their merits and demerits, but let us think only of their need--of the sorrows, the difficulties, perhaps the blindnesses, that make the misery of their lives; let us remember that they are fellow-sufferers in the same darkness, actors in the same tragedy as ourselves. and so, when their day is over, when their good and their evil have become eternal by the immortality of the past, be it ours to feel that, where they suffered, where they failed, no deed of ours was the cause; but wherever a spark of the divine fire kindled in their hearts, we were ready with encouragement, with sympathy, with brave words in which high courage glowed.""

post_06552,"stop making kids feel bad about who they are, what they like, and what their interests are. it's disgusting and it's borderline abuse. a little backstory: when i was 10 years old, charges were finally brought against my parents for child abuse. they were arrested after inflicting 10 long years of psychological and physical abuse on me. my dad's parents, my paternal grandparents, adopted me at this point, and i went to live with them. my grandfather died when i was 19 years old and pregnant with my daughter. my grandmother celebrated her 88th birthday this past week and she is truly a wonderful woman, and has dedicated every second of my life to loving me, protecting me, and providing me with the best mom i could ever ask for: herself. my grandfather was my hero and i hope i never forget how wonderful it sounded every time he laughed. i'm currently 28 years old, my grandma is currently 88 years old, and my daughter is 8 years old. 

now, onto the story...

my dad has been staying at my grandma's house for the past 2 days, visiting. my daughter and i normally go to visit with my grandma at least once a day, usually twice a day, every single day. sometimes my husband, her dad, even comes with us, and we spend literally the entire day at my grandma's. she lives right down the road, which is great for all of us. my grandma is currently on hospice, just because she has so many different medical problems, and she recently broke 3 ribs, so i've been making sure to go visit every morning and evening to feed her cats and her dog, make sure my grandma's had something to eat, wash dishes, wash clothes, and stuff like that. 

last night, my dad kept texting me, asking me to bring my daughter over to my grandma's so he could see her. i really didn't want to go, because i can't stand my dad, and he's known for starting petty arguments, calling the cops on me just for being at my grandma's, and blowing up at my daughter for next to nothing. almost every other word that comes out of my dad's mouth is the ""f word"" and he's been addicted to drugs and alcohol for the majority of his life. he has a very short fuse and it doesn't take much to make him angry.

last night, i took my daughter over to my grandma's, to see my dad and my grandma for a while. i asked her if she wanted to go, and she said yes, so off we went. my husband, bless his heart, stayed home, because, like me, he can't stand my dad and just how hateful he can be. mind you, my husband is 6'3, and a really big man. my dad is probably right at 6 foot tall, and very, very skinny. my husband and my dad have gotten into it, in the past, and thankfully it's never been physical, because i know if it ever turned into an all out brawl, my husband would break my dad in half, like a toothpick.

everything was fine, at first, and my dad, my grandma, my daughter, and i were all sitting at the kitchen table coloring together in some coloring books my dad had brought for my daughter. all of a sudden, my dad started mouthing off about how he wanted to take the 3 kittens at my grandma's home with him, so he could find homes for them, because, in his words, my grandma, ""has too many fucking cats to fucking feed."" i should mention here, that my daughter and i go to my grandma's twice a day to feed all of the cats, and the dog. my grandma currently has 5 cats, and then 3 kittens. my daughter got really, really upset when my dad said he wanted to take the kittens home with him. she loves cats and she loves playing with the kittens. she's already named them all, and my grandma has already agreed to keep them all at her house. we have 2 cats at our own house, but they're inside-only cats, and all of my grandma's cats are inside-outside cats. my daughter got really, really upset, not only because my grandma had already promised her that she could keep the kittens, but also because it's my grandma's house, not my dad's house, and she said that even if my grandma had 100 cats, it's her house, they're her cats, and it's none of my dad's business, or concern. i have to agree with her on this one. my dad also has a nasty habit of showing up at my grandma's house and trying to control everything. he'll start mouthing off at my grandma, calling her stupid, belittling her, telling her that she needs to shut the back door so flies don't get in her house, telling her that she needs to turn the heater down, and other stuff like that. she'll turn the heater on because she's cold and he'll go right behind her and turn it off, even though it's not his house, and even though she's 88 years old, so of course, she's probably colder than him.

after my daughter got upset over him threatening to take the kittens home with him, i felt like it was best that we leave, because i didn't want to give him the chance to upset her anymore, over anything else, and she's a very, very sensitive little girl. she's on the autism spectrum, and sometimes, it doesn't take much to upset her and induce a full blown meltdown.

as we were leaving, literally, as i was walking out the back door, and as my daughter was at the bottom of the steps by the back door, my dad calls out to her, ""hey, come tell me what you want for christmas."" i've already told him, several times, that she wants a kitchen set for christmas. i even sent him the link for the kitchen set she wants, so if he wanted to, he could go ahead and order it for her. i asked her if she wanted to come and tell him what she wanted for christmas, and she shook her head, no, as she stood at the bottom of the steps. i tried telling my dad that she didn't want to talk to him, but he repeated what he said to her, and she answered, ""huh,"" twice. i told my dad that she was trying to ask him what he was saying, as she couldn't hear him, and he flew up from the kitchen table, where we'd all just been coloring, and said to me, ""i don't want to fucking talk to you, i want to talk to her."" my grandma was standing in his way, apparently, because he mouthed off to her, ""can you fucking move, now, so i can go talk to her,"" and my poor grandma just said, ""i'm walking as fast as i can."" my daughter walked up the steps and he looked at her and said, **""i know you want a kitchen set for christmas, but do you realize that when you get that kitchen set, it's only going to be 2 feet tall and 3 feet wide? that kitchen set is for a fucking baby. do you want to be a little fucking baby?""**

my daughter's face scrunched up before she even began to cry. i pushed past my dad, grabbed her by the shoulders, turned her back towards the steps, and said, ""let's go to the car. now."" she followed me down the steps, and we left. when we got in the car, she was crying so hard, and she was so upset, she didn't even want to sit in the back seat, she wanted to sit in the very back of our suv to cry. i finally convinced her to just jump up into the front seat next to me, since we literally live right down the street, so it's not really a big deal for her to ride shotgun with me. i let her do it all the time. she cried nearly the whole way home, and even though it's just down the street, i hated to see her so upset. when we got home, i opened the door, and tried to comfort her, by saying, ""now then, baby, it's okay, we're home now, and it's all over,"" and immediately, my husband came flying from the bedroom, asking us, ""what happened, what did he do,"" knowing that surely, my dad did or said something stupid. i told my husband what happened, and we both comforted our daughter as best as we could. he tried to make her feel better by telling her that my dad is a complete idiot, and she should never let anyone, especially someone like my dad, make her feel bad about herself for something she likes or something she's interested in. he told her that my dad is literally a piece of walking, talking garbage, who has done nothing but drugs and alcohol his whole life, lost me because he abused me, and has accomplished virtually nothing in his 61 years of life. 

as parents, we should not have to watch our daughter cry because someone has made fun of her for her interests and hobbies. as parents, we should not have to comfort our child because her own grandfather has made fun of her. as parents, we simply should not have to deal with any of this.

as an 8 year old little girl, my daughter should not be made to feel any time of way, simply because she wants a kitchen set for christmas. she is absolutely, in my opinion, not too old for a kitchen set. i had one when i was her age, that my grandparents got for me, and i turned out just fine. i even remember getting a dollhouse for christmas when i was 10, that my grandpa helped me put the decals on. that was the best christmas i ever had growing up. 

the fact that my daughter has autism just adds insult to injury. she will not forget about what my dad said to her, or how he made her feel, for quite some time. she still drinks out of sippy cups, she still sits in a high chair when we go out to eat, she still plays with bath toys, she still watches peppa pig and similar cartoons geared towards smaller children, but she is also still mature enough, to feed and water our 2 cats at home, every day, scoop their litterbox, every day, use the stove to make scrambled eggs and pancakes by herself, take a shower, unattended, and help me carry in our groceries from the store, without even being asked to. she cleans her room, daily, without even being asked to, she sweeps off our front porch at home, daily, without even being asked to, and she singlehandedly hung up all of our christmas stockings and decorated our kitchen for christmas. she is very independent, very intelligent, and very kind hearted. she did not deserve to be put down for wanting a kitchen set for christmas.

**stop making fun of kids for showing interest in things that they enjoy. stop expecting children to grow up so fast, when they're only children. stop treating children like they don't have feelings, because i promise you, they absolutely have feelings.**

post_05873,"i'm in love with my gym bro i (male 22) fell in love with my gym bro (male 24). problem being, i thought i was straight.

this all started a few months ago, i noticed this guy at my gym and i knew something was immediately off. i was like nervous to even look at him, but i decided to get rid of that nervousness and just talk to him. he was actually really nice and funny and we quickly became buddies. then about two weeks later my girlfriend broke up with me. i told him that and we had a heart to heart where he casually came out as gay. but that initial offness that i felt when i first saw him didn't go away, and i quickly started to piece together that it was the same feeling i get when i look at a really pretty girl. 

and over the months it's been increasingly hard to be near him because he's just so…gorgeous i guess. whenever i go to sleep, i just imagine him there snuggled up to me. i just wanna text him all the time…and i just wanna kiss him so bad. i guess this is me coming out as bi…i met a beautiful guy at the gym and we became best friends, i love his personality, he makes me laugh nonstop, and ngl he's mad thick. i wanna ask him out so bad

**update**: at the gym rn, we're gonna do our sets and when we leave ima walk him to his car and tell him. thanks for the courage everyone!

**update 2**: i'm fucking crying in my car rn holy shit. he said yes. so i walked him to his car and i told him. and bruh…the way i couldn't speak lmao i was so nervous. but basically, he said he kinda thought i was into him cause ""i can only catch you respectfully staring at my butt so many times before it's a little sus"". but i told him that i'm bi…and we're going on a date friday. but like bruh…he looked so flustered and cute when i told him…he had the prettiest smile lmao. and for the people saying stuff about my vocab and texting…i'm a history major, not smart…my vocab consists of ""i guess"", ""like"", ""idk"", ""bruh"", and ""fucking"". but anyways…i guess we're a little more than just gym bros now…i seriously couldn't have done this if this didn't get so much random ass support lmao. anyways…i'm fucking shaking…i actually did it…bruh i love him so much…so so so fucking much. thank you for the support!

because of the reactions i have had, even the kind ones, i don't tell anyone. but now it is growing like a fear that i am some wierd thing. i love myself. so as soon as i feel someone's rude to me, i just keep them away from my life. like a defence mechanism. i don't hate them, i just don't mind them. but that is also one of my fears, i mean, when you are so comfortable with yourself that you won't let anyone come near your peace, will that lead to you being alone? i am turning 26 this year, and i just don't want to be alone.",0

it highlights how the news, the media, etc. has been talking of the end of the world and various dangers, many of which never came to be, for a long, long time. it does this in a funny way too, which, from an acceptance and commitment therapy perspective, acts as a defusion intervention, helping you to reframe apocalyptic media happening now, as being in the same ongoing theme of: 
""look, look at this dangerous thing. you're in danger. give us money/clicks/likes/attention.""

post_03279,"getting panic attacks while driving on the highway in mid-december, i was driving on a highway for about an hour, when all of a sudden, i started to dissociate and feel like i was going to pass out (felt lightheaded and woozy). this developed into a full on panic attack and prompted me to pull over and let my wife drive. i have dealt with panic attacks in the past, but never while driving--and it had been years since my last full blown panic attack.

ever since that moment in mid-december, i have now experienced panic attacks almost every time i drive on a highway (and sometimes even when driving in town, but less so).

i have done some therapy sessions, and even got my eyes evaluated--which led to a diagnoses of ""convergence insufficiency"". i am in the process of scheduling eye therapy and getting prism glasses to help, but i'm not sure how much that will help the panic attacks.

my question is, what is the best therapy for this issue? cbt, hypnotherapy, continued counseling sessions? there's a lot of opinions on what helps panic attacks ""the most"", but some of the advice seems to conflict with each other.

i've tried what helped my panic attacks in the past by ""leaning in"" to the panic symptoms and embracing them, but that isn't helping like it used to.

i won't go into details, but an older boy consistently sa'd me, and i ended up pregnant at 13. my living circumstances made it impossible to seek any form of help, from either my parents or professionals. it felt like i was backed into a corner, and i eventually decided to do it myself, and tried an at home abortion using some sort of kindey medication i stole my grandmother and the handle of a kitchen utensil. to say it went poorly is an understatement. it nearly killed me, and i've living with multiple complications because of it.

to add a sick layer of irony on it all, the same month i did it, my mother moved me halfway across the country to a catholic school. the shame i felt from being in that environment was overwhelming and it silenced me for years. with all the rhetoric around, it was like a constant message of: ""every child's life matters, expect for you."" as such, i never spoke to anyone about it until i was 17, and only told an actual doctor about it within the last week.

quitting smoking has been difficult, but it's made me realise how powerful i can be. i never thought i would go this long without a cigarette, but somehow i managed it. everyday it got easier and easier and now i can proudly say i don't even think about a cigarette when i wake up, or after a meal. i've finally got the monkey off my back.

more then that, it's changed the way i feel about other stuff. challenges or difficulties seem less daunting and unachievable. it's like i've unlocked a part of my brain that i didn't know existed. i still have bad habits, but now i feel like i have the strength not to let them control my actions.

i really wish my mum could see me now and tell me she was proud of me.",0
post_06415,"the 911 call i'll never forget. in 2013 i got dispatched to the local high school for a nose bleed. turns out this 15 year old kid was bleeding because he got kicked in the face while he was sitting with his back against the wall, playing a game on his gameboy. his nose was obviously broken and the kid has dried blood all down the front of his shirt. 

we got him in the back of my ambulance, cleaned him up and called his mom. she said that the school had already called her, she worked 20 minutes away and said she was coming to get him herself, and she would take him to the er. 

while we waited he explained to me all about his game. it was called luigis mansion. he told me he wanted to design water slides and video games when he grew up. he told me about history of our town i had never heard of. he was very clearly intelligent, well spoken. he just didn't fit in. i enjoyed talking to him. when his mom got there i gave him a fist bump, told him that i didn't fit in either when i was younger but i worked hard and now i have a job and life i love. i told him everything gets better when you get out of high school. 

the next shift (6 days later) i got dispatched to his house. his mom found him hanging in his closet. i have no doubt he would be a super rich and successful software developer right now if it wasn't for the relentless bullying he suffered. 

this was the only time i've ever frozen on a call. he had obviously signs of death, and he was beyond saving. my partner tried to console his mother in the front room and i just stood there, staring at him. after 8-10 minutes the police arrived and took over the scene. 

at this point in my career i've seen hundreds of dead bodies. i've been on much more traumatic and messy calls. i've learned to forget them and move on. except for this kid, i think about him every day.",0

i think i spend more time in my one head than in the real life. i constantly fantasise and i take refuge in books and tv shows. 
i'm very emphatic too, and i usually imagen how is does the characters feels. 
don't get me wrong, i know what is real life and what isn't. but i took comfort in imaginary worlds and usually overindulge in this feelings and worlds. 

i feel like life is extremely unpleasant more of the time. when i was younger this could had been seen as ""daydreaming"" but i'm almost 22 years old now… and i don't know if this is still a good thing.

every single day.

you might not know me, and i might not know you... we're literally strangers! *i have no idea who you people are!*

but to step up to the subreddit, post online about your personal problems, is brave as duck. 

 please give yourself credit. do you know what you did by simply posting that post about (x) ?? someone might relate to it, and need help on (x) , someone might just be interested in (x) and read about it, someone might be going exactly what you're going through, but remain silent... maybe they'll speak up because of you!!

with one push of a ""post"" , amazing things are sure to come with it... you spoke up about it... and that is so good! 

you're more amazing than you know. you matter to me, if that means anything. 

take care.

please stay safe.

if anyone needs me, i'm always just a message away!! i don't mind listening :) love to hear from new people!!

keep your heads held high, hope you all have an amazing day / night... wherever you may live! 

love you all!

#edit 

i'm sorry i ended up falling asleep! it was 3 am or so when i wrote this, and i thought ""only a couple of people will see it"" ... boy, was i wrong. 

thanks for the awards, someone mentioned that someone wrote something similar, but its hard to find that post.. — something like that - so i'll try my best to contribute a lot more here; probably a weekly thing! like a weekly check up , see how everyone is, and such :) 

i'm just about to read the comments now, and reply!

#edit v2

we all have that thought of ""this looks so dumb"" , ""why am i doing this?"" when about to post online on a subreddit, and in social media in general... 

know all those tiktok ""famous people"" ?? they are human, too. they probably were sure as ducky duck scared to post online for others to view , judge , comment , like , etc.,, but now look? they are perfectly okay with posting whatever — even sometimes the silliest, stupidest things... those who comment ""i wish i had the ability to do what you do"" ... *you can* 

nothing is stopping you. you are only stopping yourself! 

with one little push of a ""post"" could change your life.. change someones life, emotions, thinking process.. think its scary , right?! it is!!

yes , anxiety...other mental illnesses... but those do not define you. you are more than your mental illness. don't be afraid to do what you love, and keep doin it! 

i am with you every step of the day. 

together, we will both live our ""dream life"" ... take care, sendin prayers that you have a good life!",0

as a religious person, it is not fun at all. suffering in this world and the hereafter does not sound fair. i just want to end it all without burning in fire for eternity. but i am sure the fire will be my punishment if i were to commit suicide. but at the same time, i am suffering in this world. so really it all comes down to what is worse. i choose suffering here.

but at the same time not. i want to end it all. the shame, the struggle, the pain. everything in this world i hate. there is nothing stopping me from ending my life other than the hellfire. not even my loved ones. and i do not even feel selfish writing this. i am being honest.

someday i am sure suicide will be my only option. then the fear of hellfire will be gone. even if it is not gone, i will be so lost and sad, losing my faith, and then i will commit suicide. i cannot wait for that day to come. i will then slice my throat open and, finally, put an end to all my suffering. or, on the other hand, start a journey full of great suffering. as you can tell, i am contradicting myself all the time. that is because i am lost. and very sad. i want to die.",1

post_01583,"i want to ""fail"" a suicide attempt so i can ultimately get help  i want to hurt myself in a way that seems like a suicide attempt but won't kill me or give me long lasting effects (like brain damage) so i can get the help i need.

i truly am considering the act of suicide but i want to try getting help, however the hospital i go to doesn't take patients with suicidal thoughts seriously unless they're actually hurt. 

additionally, i also want attention. i can't believe i'm even admitting it, but i feel like everyone in my life thinks i'm ""just saying it"" and that i'm never gonna get the balls to do anything. 

i know how incredibly selfish that is of me but i'm tired of having everyone assume that i'm fine and that i'll get over what i'm struggling with because i've been struggling for years and i'm exhausted.

i don't have any options and i'm going to find a way regardless, this is just one of my last resorts. i don't have any more to give 

so, i ask if anyone knows ways that will seem like an attempt but not kill me. i'm too much of a coward to take pills because i'm anxious of the potential brain damage, but if there's some sort of dosage of something that will make me pass out or something that could pass as an attempt i would appreciate it.

i've tried and failed this multiple times and i finally got it.

post_05078,"sick of people refusing to respect my choice to not want kids. note: this is a fairly long vent

for starters, i like to think of myself as a pretty reasonable person  
i respect people's opinions and points of view, even if they completely oppose my own, as long as they don't try to invade my rights or choices. if someone says something i don't agree with or does something for themself i disagree with, i usually don't say anything.

i respect most parents. being a parent is a hard and thankless job, but one thing i hate more than anything else, is people who **refuse to respect** my choices and opinions, even when i respect theirs.

**i am so, so fucking sick of people being disrespectful, dismissive and rude to my personal choices,**

but the one that gets the most negative attention, is when people find out i don't plan to have kids, ever.  
they start interrogating and questioning me like they're getting paid for it.

i don't need a reason to not want kids. i don't understand why i should bother to have children if i won't love them or even want them? that's not fair for either of us. i would hate to not give a child the love they need. it's better to not have kids than to be a bad parent, and no i am not going to just have them and then ill end up wanting them. that's not how it works. i'm not going to have them, period. that by itself is already a good enough reason to not have kids. i genuinely think i, for myself and for the sake of the kid, am making the right choice by not having kids.

some of the most irritating, nerve-racking responses i've gotten to  
*''oh, i don't actually plan on having kids.''* or similar statements have been:

*''you'll change your mind.''*  
*''what if your parents thought the same, huh?''*  
*''what's your meaning in life?''*  
*''i thought the same when i was your age too''*  
*''your biological clock is ticking!''*  
*''all women end up wanting kids though. they are designed to have and want kids''*  
*''but you were a kid once!''*  
*''who's going to take care of you when you're old? you'll be lonely in a nursing home?''*  
*''your family must be so disappointed in you.''*  
*''why do women nowadays hate kids so much?''*  
*''if everyone thought the same as you, we'd die out and the human race will go extinct!''*  
*''no man wants to marry a woman who doesn't want kids. you'll be lonely for life.''*  
*''explain to me why you don't want kids, and you better have a valid reason.''*  
*''but it's the most beautiful thing ever to make kids. it doesn't make sense to me why you wouldn't want to.''*  
*''then you're a waste of oxygen, that's your entire purpose as a woman. why don't you just k\*\*\* yourself then?''*  
*''what's wrong with you, did you have childhood trauma, is that why you don't want kids?''*  
*''childless cat lady!'' (no, this didn't come from jd vance btw, it was a family friend)*

some of these, particularly the first few, are things i hear over and over after telling people i don't plan on having kids.

these people seem to think becoming a parent/mother *(mostly mother, as i've seen childfree women be pestered more than childfree men, but it can definitely go both ways.)* is something everyone has to do,  
and there's no if's, or's, or but's about it. like it's written in stone.

i'm sick of it. let me make things clear. no, i won't change my mind. i know that.  
and no one has the place to tell me that because i'm pretty sure they can't see into the future, so they can't tell me what i will or will not do in the future. i know better about what i'll do than someone else does. especially someone who barely knows me. and just because you ended up changing your mind doesn't mean everyone else will, just like you did, and end up having kids. it's very dismissive and disrespectful to just blurt out *''you'll change your mind''* after someone has told you about what they've decided on. you can't just go around telling people they''ll change their mind because you did, because not everyone is you. my purpose in life isn't simply to be a parent. i don't know for sure what my purpose is, but someone telling me that my only reason in life is to bring more life and if i don't want to i should just k\*\*\* myself is too excessive. it's also just a horrible thing to say to someone.

i want the same respect i give them. just an *''oh, alright.''* would do.  
or an *''alright, i respect your choice as long as you aren't rude towards my kids or anything.''*

but do i get that as my usual response? no. i get insulted and ridiculed instead.

i'm also sick of men telling women shit about not wanting kids. you don't know crap about what we go through and how painful it is. not everything is all sunshine and rainbows like some men think it is. the amount of fucking idiotic men i've had tell me i'll change my mind because i'm a woman and all women are designed to want kids is fucking stupid.

one of the common answers is ***''oh, you're selfish.''***

it makes me so mad that this is an automatic response people say to me before even hearing any of my reasoning. first of all, it feels like they're trying to insult me or make me feel bad/guilt trip for not wanting kids.

now here's the thing - it wouldn't actually make me so mad if they actually had a fucking clue what they were talking about. these people who call me selfish seem to be projecting. they just have such a big ego that they can't admit they're in the wrong for refusing to respect everyone. people who have kids have them for their own sake, not the sake of the kid. the kid will benefit more from not existing.

easily, i could say that people who have kids are adding to overpopulation and that people who have kids only care about their own bloodline and family, because if they actually were as selfless as they made themselves out to be, they'd adopt a child in need of a loving home instead of bringing yet another child into an overpopulated and so flawed world because they want ''their own'' kid and to pass on their bloodline and legacy. if you're so selfless, adopt a child who's parents were tragically killed. someone who's already here and is literally dying in poverty to be loved by anyone. how selfless, am i fucking right? this is projecting on another level. you see me not as how i am. but as how you are.

calling someone selfish. for not wanting kids is the stupidest thing you can say to them.  
but sadly, it's one of the most common answers. i'm fed up with having people throw that stupid little disgusting word at me. but lucky for me, i can throw it right back at them because i know i'm not the selfish one here. i'm not the one forcing someone else to do something because i'm upset that they'll be spending their own hard-earned money to spend on themselves, instead of another person yet to enter the bloody planet.  
but when people tell me they want kids, or even call me selfish or tell me about how i have to have kids,  
**i don't say those things to them. why? because i respect their choice.**  
if they want kids, i'm happy for them and i hope they get the happy family they've always dreamt of.

if someone wants to call me selfish for choosing myself over someone who doesn't exist, then alright, fine.  
i'm selfish. i choose myself. if i'm selfish because i don't want to go through pregnancy, the body and hormonal changes that come with it, i dont want my body to be be changed permanently like that.    i  don't want my body to change so drastically, or even die,  you might literally die. have people forgot birtch is so hard on the body it can kill you?  then yes, i am selfish.

i could have the baby tragically pass away and then i'll live with that sadness.

being a parent is hard. and it's a thankless job. that's why i respect majority of parents, but how hard it is is a reason to realize being a parent is not for everyone. id on't want to deal with the problems of parenting. not the pregnancy part, not the potentially being low on money part, not the caring for another human part, none of it. i already get tired pretty easily. i don't have the energy to be a parent.

but you still want me to have kids. hmm.  
if you're a parent who gets mad at other people's choices to not have kids, i hate to break it to you but you probably aren't happy yourself.

these people clearly don't understand the meaning of selfish.  
i could very easily throw that word right back at them because of the deadly economic impacts they're causing because they wanted to have a kid instead of adoption or literally any other option. every birth is a death.  
but i don't say that to anyone in person, because i know how to not attack people for their personal life choices.  
just because i don't want to have kids myself, doesn't mean i hate them.  
**not wanting something ≠ hating said thing.**  
i would never, ever do something like make fun of a kid getting hurt. in fact, if i see a kid get hurt i'll help them in any way i can or call their parents.  
anyone who laughs at kids getting hurt is a complete asshole. do not associate people who choose to not have their own children with those who are cruel to them. not the same at all.

let me be absolutely fucking clear, i am not selfish.  
and even if i was, who would i be harming by being so selfish? the answer is no one. i'm actually helping the planet if anything.  
let's say even they were right, okay so i chose not to have kids. so what? am i harming the kid? the one that doesn't fucking exist? the one i chose not to bring into this shitbag we call a world?

i can actually tell you right now a couple things my *''selfish''* self isn't doing. i'm ***not:***  
*- bringing a child into an overpopulated and corrupt world.*  
*- increasing my carbon footprint more than i have to.*  
*- throwing trash on the ground*  
*- eating meat*  
*- attacking others for their choices*  
so let me be clear, i'm so selfish, so greedy, because i want to spend the money, i earned on myself before accommodating someone who doesn't yet exist, because i choose to not bring an innocent, naive child into a sick world where they could get murdered or worse? because i don't want to have to force someone to take care of me when i'm old and carry my family name?  
nice fucking try guilt tripping me.  
if you want to make me feel like i'm a bad person because i am choosing not to bring a child into this fucked world, you're going to have to try a lot harder than that.

when people are pushy and obnoxious and ask me personal questions like *''when do you think you'll have kids?''* or *''why  haven't you had kids yet?''* my emotional mind wants to piss them off even more than my decision to not have kids already has, and say something like ''you're damn right. i am selfish. i chose myself over my nonexistant kid. and i have more money, happiness, sleep and free time to do whatever the fuck i want than you ever will'' and see how they like it. it serves them right especially after they constantly pester me with ''have fun dying alone!'' or ''your life will be sad!''  you know, i can say basically everything they say to me but back. 

i hate the people who say not having kids is selfish. it's not. it's literally not. if one more idiot accuses me of being selfish and narcissistic because of my choice to be childfree, i'll ask them why they, as such a selfless person, chose to bring another person into an overpopulated and dying world of misery instead of adopting someone in need. then i'll watch their answer be something like **''i wanted my own kid to take care of my when i'm old and to pass on my family name and legacy. why should i adopt someone who isn't related to me?'** ask me why i chose not to have kids and my answer will be because **""i just don't want them"".** but people don't accept this as an answer and they demand that i give a ""valid"" answer. you know what? fine. i can give you so many other reasons i see as ""valid"" in this messed up world with hate, a gross *(gross in the ew way, not in the lots way)* economy, i think it's best for me to not procreate. would i consider adoption? maybe. but i don't want to bring another person into this world. i just don't. and no, i'm by zero means saying having kids is a selfish choice, i'm saying people have kids because they want kids. not because they want someone to be selfless to. people who call childfree people selfish just don't like the idea of someone making a different choice than them and actually enjoying their life how they want to. not everyone has to have kids! making a new human being is the selfish option. the planet is overpopulated, we definitely don't need more people, there's no bloody room left for us. no resources. there  is people dying. wake up. we don't need to keep making people, we literally need the opposite of that. the most harmful, planet harming, climate change harming, carbon intensive thing you can do is procreate.  if people gave love and care to others that are already here instead of making more and more people, we could afford to put more people in a sustainable life in so many ways. so no, i'm not selfish for choosing not to procreate. i am making my own choice and if you think that's selfish that says more about you than me. i'm so fed up with some parents being so rude to me over my choice. i wish they'd just respect my decision but no! they always interrogate and insult me for it.. i'm **so fucking fed up.** i just want my choice to be respected. gosh.. why is it such a hard thing to ask for?i really don't understand how people will call those without kids ''selfish'', because to me it really seems like the selfless option to not have any biological children to me.  there are no ''non-selfish'' reasons to have children. name one.  the life of that child is going to be crap. who wants to be in this shithole of a world?

**instead** of bringing a kid into the world, with all that disposable money, i'm going to...  
*- pay my expenses. make sure i'm not in debt in this messed up economy.*  
*- provide for my cats. maybe adopt more. (alright fine, perhaps the childless cat lady guy wasn't wrong, but what's wrong with that?)*  
*- spend the money on higher quality items that i'd usually spend on standardized items, such as organic foods.*  
*- buy from small businesses instead of fast fashion or wholesale companies, as i like to support individuals instead of people.*  
*- donate to charities i support such as anything related to genuinely helping animals or people in need.*  
*- help family to an extent, if they're in need.*  
*- travel, if the opportunity is there.*

i don't understand why people get so upset when they find out i don't want kids.  
it's not like i said *''you shouldn't have (had) kids.''*

it's my life. my choice. i don't exist to please you. i don't exist to do what you want me to do with my life.

i'm sick of not getting the respect i honestly think i deserve.  
i try my best to be reasonable with people, but it's now really getting on my nerves. i just wanted to vent it out. i needed to let it out. i'm just so done with being disrespected and insulted over my choice.  
the older i get, the more i get asked about this. it's not one of those things people stop asking you after you hit a certain age. it's one of those things people ask more and more while you're going into adulthood.

to anyone who took the time to read this entire thing, thanks so much for putting in the couple minutes to listen to my rant. i know you're a stranger, but it still means a lot to me that someone will hear me out.

i don't want kids. and i don't owe you any explanation\*. ''but why?''\* none of your business even. my answer is my fucking answer and you need to learn to accept it. i'm done with the people calling me selfish. i'm so fucking done. i deserve to be respected for my choice and get an *''oh, alright''* to my response the same way i respond to others instead of the bs i hear at least once a month... i just want people to shut up and respect my choice instead of pestering me all the time.

even if you disagree for any reason, you can comment, but gosh please don't be rude to me. i'm just so done with people forcing this on me. if anyone could just give honest feedback to how i feel about this i would appreciate it. not responding to any troll/ragebait comments.",0
post_06460,"i bumped into a nurse from my childhood at the grocery store and burst into tears. i've never been so embarrassed but finally got to tell phil how i feel about him. i've never felt better. i was born with congenital heart defects. i had multiple heart surgeries as a child and spent so much time in the icu that i knew the entire staff and had at one point spent more time in the hospital than at home. my parents had me when they were older and really didn't have the energy anymore. my health drained their energy and i was really considered a nuisance. my mother was often annoyed with me and my father focused on work.

as a kid in the icu after surgery, or pneumonia, or a complication, you're often in pain, scared and unable to help yourself. i was frequently on ventilators, tied to a bed and unable to move. the only person who ever seemed to care was a nurse practitioner named phil. he helped me develop a way to communicate when i was intubated. he would help me get comfortable, figure out what was wrong and not only did he do simple things like touch my hand or adjust my hair, he actually looked at me. when he was on, i felt like i wasn't so alone. he'd make bad jokes, help me when i was itchy and he'd make sure i was okay. the doctors and so many nurses looked past you. they went about their job, sometimes making remarks as if you weren't there. sometimes he could only stop and chat for a couple of minutes, but he chatted with me and i felt like someone finally noticed me.

he was always so gentle and made sure he minimized discomfort. one morning they removed a orogastric tube and tried to place a nasogastric tube. they failed over and over. i wanted to scream but couldn't. the drugs weren't helping and they wanted to ween me off the vent, so i felt everything. by the third attempt they got phil who numbed my nose and throat, rolled me, got it on the first attempt. he wrapped me in warm blankets, put on soft music and i passed out.

over several years, he was consistently the one person i could trust. he had learned what worked for me, he knew my situation and he had really worked to find ways to make my stay comfortable. when he was on shift, i felt like i had an ally, someone i could trust. he was closer to me than my parents. phil knew me better and genuinely seemed to care. he helped me do things that weren't in his job description, like washing my hair or helping with homework. he was an advocate for me, especially when the residents wanted to send me for more invasive testing. he would explain everything so i could understand but also contextualize the situation. i felt smarter when he talked to me. he would notice when i was concerned about something and would help understand what was going on and calm me down. that was a huge burden off my shoulders.

he was like a mother and father. he was also my only real friend.

the last time i saw him was the last time i was in the icu. the day before i left he said goodbye as he was going to crna school. he shook my hand, told me that i was owed a few years and that he knew i would do just fine. i didn't want to get emotional, so i made a joke and said ""bye!"" in a funny/sarcastic way. i wanted to scream. i missed my friend. i was 13 years old and too cool to tell him what i wanted to say. i always regretted that.

i moved hundreds of miles away. i survived hyper anxiety during covid and a year locked away. i finally go to the grocery store and as i'm walking in, i see a familiar face putting on a mask. i stop in my tracks. he notices me. i figure he couldn't *possibly* remember me, and then he goes ""well, if it isn't little katie \[last name\]!"" i burst into tears. instead of being awkward or trying to escape me, we sat in front of the grocery store and talked. i told him everything i wanted to tell him. i got to meet his wife and his child. i got to tell her what he had done for me.

i couldn't believe that we'd randomly be in the same town at the same time and that i would finally get to say what i had wanted to tell him for years. it was so nice hearing about becoming a crna, and working with children still. i felt so happy to finally get closure and to know that not only is he okay, but that he knows how i feel.

my childhood was awful. i don't miss the illness, but at least the one person who put any effort into getting to know me now knows how much i appreciate them. to look at him, you wouldn't believe that he was a nurse, or that he was so kind. before becoming an np, he had been in the marines. he looks like a tough dude, but he's genuinely the nicest, smartest person i've ever met.",0

post_01511,"does anyone else not want to die, but have intrusive thoughts like ""i need to die"", ""why are you still alive"", ""i'm not even human"", etc? it's starting to really scare me. I never used to have these dark thoughts, but lately they've been creeping in more often. It's terrifying to feel like my own mind is turning against me, questioning my worth and existence. I just want to make it stop and find a way back to feeling like myself again.",1
post_07288,"lost in the darkness everything feels like it's crumbling around me. i wake up every morning with a heaviness in my chest that just won't go away. the world seems so dark, and i can't find a single ray of light to hold on to. it's like i'm trapped in this endless cycle of pain and despair, and i can't see a way out.  my family doesn't understand what i'm going through. they tell me to just get over it, to be strong, but they don't realize that i'm drowning in this ocean of sadness. i feel so alone, like no one truly sees me for who i am.  i've been thinking more and more about ending it all. the idea of escaping this endless torment is starting to feel like the only way out. i know it's not the right answer, but the pain is becoming unbearable.  i don't know where to turn or who to talk to. i'm lost in this darkness, and i can't seem to find a way back to the light. i just want the hurting to stop, even if it means i have to end it all.",1
post_00228,"an online friend texted me and said she was going to kill herself, and i don't know what else i can do. i (f20) known this online friend (f21-22) for almost a year now. we met through an online game.

i don't want to disclose too much about her situation, but she experienced a lot of close losses and it took a large toll on her. i've tried to keep in touch with her as much as i can, but i've been struggling with depression myself and have a hard time communicating or being social in general. i feel like an asshole because i feel like haven't been there for her enough.

she recently texted me around an hour ago that she was leaving to kill herself. i have no idea where she lives or her full name (or any other personal information), so i can't call the authorities to find her. i feel like i'm running against a brick wall and time itself. i've tried texting her to try and distract her from doing anything further, but she hasn't responded. i've tried reaching out to a mutual friend of ours, but he hasn't responded either.

i'm really trying not to spiral myself, but i'm getting close to freaking out. i feel like what ever happens to her is my fault because i wasn't there for or open with her more. 

i don't know. i just really needed someplace to put this here. i'm sorry if this post violates any rules here.",0
