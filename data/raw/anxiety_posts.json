    "title": "Pneumonia is a problem for me...",
    "selftext": "Now, do I think I have any symptoms of pneumonia? Not really. But do I have a right to be concerned about it? Absolutely. \nI feel like in my household, getting pneumonia is inevitable at some point, especially as we get into the colder months. For example: I caught pneumonia three years ago! We were able to clear it super early as I had symptoms including the normal fever, paleness, headache, and the unfortunate lung crackling. The steroids they gave me seemed to melt as soon as I popped them in my mouth so that wasn't a real great experience. \nBut about that is before I caught pneumonia, my grandfather had pneumonia and was hospitalized.. \nAnd then he died. Though, not from pneumonia. He pulled his breathing mask off when the nurse frustrated him and the suffocated. Thought I'd share that. \nBut it seems like after a few months after he died, his ghost decided he wanted to drag me down to Hell with him and gave his sickness to me. \nEither way, I survived in the end and since then, no problems besides just the regular fevers. \nNow as of recently though, my step-grandfather had just gotten pneumonia himself. He lives in our house. I felt really bad for him because he already has a slew of health problems already and he's probably my favorite grandfather by far. He was in the hospital for a couple days but now he's back in the house, probably on some kind of new medicine to help with his lungs. \nAnd though I'm relatively healthy(minus my love for lounging in bed all day), I have gotten concerned about if and when my pneumonia will return. I've been looking out for symptoms this entire winter and I fear I maybe missed a few. \nJust recently I saw my phlegm had some kind of grey looking junk in it, and due to bad habits, I looked up what it may have been. \nSymptoms of pneumonia. But then I also saw that it could've been a clump of dust in my snot which would make a lot of sense because just yesterday as of posting this I cleaned my brothers dusty, dirty fire hazard of a room. \nBut also, I've had off and on chest pains. They come in very quick, not-too-painful zaps in my chest that seemingly happen at random.. Or when I breathe. I can't seem to deter if it's random or controlled. Either way, that freaks me out a lot. I thought it may have been heart problems, but I'm too young for a heart attack, right? \nMaybe. But you know what can put a strain on your heart? Pneumonia. Yeah. That's how my step-grandfather got diagnosed. He thought he was having a heart attack but it was really just pneumonia! I mean, what are the odds this isn't happening to me!?\n\nI really just need to convince someone to take me to a doctor if I'm so worried. I'm not 18 yet, and even when I do turn, it's not like I'll have my drivers license either way. This was just me venting my worries. I'm not looking for medical advice and I'm not looking to scare anyone. But if you are having symptoms; please, please, PLEASE talk with your doctor or someone you know. \nI'll definitely update later if I can convince someone to make me a doctors visit.",

    "selftext": "M35, Athletic, no smoking/drinking\n\n\nSo, I don‚Äôt know how to start this, but i think/hope this is the right subreddit for it.\n\nAs mentioned in the title i currently have insane insomnia/sleep disturbance. I can easily fall asleep, which i usually do between 9-10pm, but suddenly wake up at around 01:00-03:00 in the middle of the night and it‚Äôs almost impossible to fall back to sleep. In the past i often woke up during the night, but quickly and easily fell asleep again.\n\nThe last 2 nights i also experienced light night sweats around the lower part of my neck and the collar of my shirt and between my scapula. \n\nMy doc prescribed me Mirtrazapine 7.5mg. It worked wonders the first 5 nights, but the effect just went away.\n\nBackstory:\n\nEnd of november i quit Atenolol 25mg which i took due to extrasystoles. I had a full heart check (MRI, ECG, stress and holter ECG‚Äòs, ultrasound) and my heart is healthy.\n\nRight after quitting Atenolol i experienced really bad withdrawl effects (heart pounding, higher resting and walking/running HR). It got really bad when one evening i had a lot of food with ice cream. That evening my heart went crazy, i had bad pressure in my epigastric area, neusea, mushy stool, feeling of fullness and loss of appetite for like a week. During this time i had really bad panic attacks and developed immense health anxiety. I was always a little hypochondric, but this stress took it to another level. My sleep was like non existance anymore. I was constantly worrying about my health.\n\nOver christmas my appetite, digestive system and heart got a little better until, on around 4th of january i had pizza and the next day had mushy stool again with light pressure in my epigastric area and appetite went down again. I started to worry about my bad appetite and everything again like crazy and it was making everything worse.\n\nSo i went to a gastroenterologist who is also a haematologist/oncologist because my digestive system was worrying me so much. We did multiple blood work, 2 abdominal ultrasounds and a full MRI of thorax and abdomen.\n\nBlood work always great and both abdominal ultrasounds fine (spleen 11.5cm). The MRI a week later was great except my spleen being enlarged with 14cm (i had mononucleosis in 09; had 2 ultrasounds back then and the last one measured 14.5cm‚Ä¶i don‚Äôt know where it sattled after that). I am 192cm (6‚Äú3) and 90-91kg‚Ä¶maybe its somehow still considered normal for my size‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt know\n\nAfter that we did another blood work (virus/lymphadenopathy) which just shows that i have IgG EBV..my doc didn‚Äòt wanna do any further tests (or at least didn‚Äòt say anything).\n\nI am awaiting gastroscopy/colonoscopy in 3 weeks.\n\nI had Covid by end of august with following chronic sinusitis for 1 month. Got steroid nasal spray and it quickly went away.\n\n5 days ago i got a stuffed nose again (switching sides every 2-3h) and immediately think of suppressed immune system.\n\nCurrently i m just constantly freaking about my spleen, my digestive problems, bad sleep and know those light night ‚Äûsweats‚Äú the past 2 nights. Paradoxically i feel fit and awake the next morning. I even go for little runs. I don‚Äòt know if i exaggerate every tiny ‚ÄûSymptom‚Äú i get.\n\nMy tests been - ‚Äûexcept my spleen‚Äú - been all great, but i still get this feeling something is wrong. My doc(s) all are really chill (but take everything serious)\n\nI just can‚Äòt get a rest, under constant stress, missing sleep, scared of going to bad and worrying about my health. I actually always trusted my body and was never sick (except EBV and covid). I just don‚Äòt how ‚Äûsick‚Äú my mind/psyche can get me and if some of these symptoms could be caused by it.\n\nIt‚Äôs a long text, but it somehow helps me collect my thoughts and maybe find someone who experienced similar things and has a tip how to manage my sleep..\n\nI am currently visiting a paychologist, but always felt like talking to people who are in the ‚Äûsame‚Äú boat helped me a lot.\n\nI feel so exhausted and missing my past self. I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äòs how (health) anxiety feels like because i never experienced it before..\n\nHave a great day, stay safe \n",

Stopping again, smoking less?\nI should add that I‚Äôve been diagnosed with GAD but it was always pretty manageable when I recognized it. Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you!",

    "selftext": "My mind has been struggling a lot recently. I get this thing where when ever I find an interest or a favourite thing, my mind purposely starts showing me flaws in that thing. Therefore it makes me have a road block in this thing I like. Picture this, as an example say you love Super-Man. It‚Äôs a bit random but listen. So you love Super-Man but your mind randomly says things about them and makes you care about things you shouldn‚Äôt care about, for example say your mind made you feel like his powers are not consistent and that‚Äôs an issue, even though other people know that and don‚Äôt care. You really care and it makes you not able to enjoy that thing. Another example picture you like two things equally and your mind makes you pick between them, so if you don‚Äôt pick your unhappy and just‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt explain just not comfortable feels like wrong doing and you can‚Äôt tell yourself it doesn‚Äôt matter. But when you pick one you wish you liked them equally which gives the same feeling. So that‚Äôs the basics of it. I don‚Äôt really know what to do anymore, I‚Äôve been on meds for about 1 and a half months but they haven‚Äôt helped much. But you know it does hurt, feeling this way. I don‚Äôt really know what to feel anymore I feel like I‚Äôve accepted I won‚Äôt ever feel satisfied with my interests even though it still hurts every day. But that‚Äôs what‚Äôs been going through my head. It‚Äôs also very distracting, say your doing something with a deadline your mind is constantly clouded trying to fix these ‚Äúproblems‚Äù that really I‚Äôm convinced can‚Äôt be fixed. I don‚Äôt know anyone that has anxiety or has any experience like this. But it‚Äôs been tough. Even though I‚Äôve only been on meds for about a month and a half. My first issue occurred a little over a year ago, but looking back I had issues before then just I didn‚Äôt really notice. They haven‚Äôt stopped since it‚Äôs constant, anyway I could go on forever but that‚Äôs not an option. Just wanted to feel heard and get some advice, since nothing has felt right for so long. So if you have any advice or words of wisdom I‚Äôd love to hear them, thanks.",

    "selftext": "Hi all. I'm going to cut straight to the point because I know I could ramble on forever & fail to get my point across. \n\nFor the life of me, I CANNOT STAND DRAMA, in any form or fashion. People talking bad about each other, people talking about ME, people spreading misinformation, ''he said'' ''she said,'' anything of that sort. I hate when there's events that transpire because of these things. When things get scandalous and people argue and fight. When I get dragged into things that have A. nothing to do with me, or B. did NOT need to be taken to such extremes.\n\nI have ADHD, I'm also an alcoholic. I have terrible anxiety and a panic disorder, amongst God knows how many other things. I have found that (semi-obviously) when I am in my addiction and drinking, I tend to isolate, every single time. (This is just for reference).\n\nI've been sober now for 4.5 months (which i've done before.) As I continue staying sober, I am finding more and more that any form of drama sends me into a downward spiral and makes me want to isolate away from people, delete my accounts, go fucking off the grid. That's how insane it drives me. My heart races and it's all I think about. I hate being persecuted for things that aren't my fault. \n\n  \nNow, here's my dilemma. I'm someone who likes to get to the core of an issue. I like to know where it's coming from, and WHY. I have some trauma related to my dad being falsely-accused of things in the past, when he was innocent. I've had a shit ton of drama in my life over the last 5 years due to my personal choices, and my alcoholism. \n\n  \nI just can't seem to find another way around it, other than to isolate myself, which I KNOW is not good for me. But quite frankly, I know that the state I go into when drama is happening also isn't good for me. Trust me, I've done my best to stay out of stuff. I work in a very dramatic field (I work at a rehab) where not only the staff has drama, but obviously the clients. I understand that I may not be cut out for that, but I also love my job and I love helping others, and I have a lot to offer the community. \n\n  \nAnyways, I don't know where I'm even going with this. I've just had a lot of drama around me for several weeks now and I just feel like I'm at a breaking point, and I'm worried I'm starting to reverse some of my progress and falling back into a negative frame of mind due to this. I'm just fucking overwhelmed, sick of people, sick of trying to avoid drama at all costs, and I just want to know why I feel like this and why it affects me so much. Fuck. Thanks for listening.",

I didn‚Äôt even know RA for anxiety was a thing until my Boss called me after hours tonight to tell me to try. She knows I have anxiety and she knows I‚Äôm a very hard worker and I can be completely trusted working from home.\n\nI don‚Äôt know the first thing about what to say and how to request it. I love my job and I don‚Äôt want to lose it but I would‚Äôve never applied for it if it wasn‚Äôt a telework position. There was never ever talk\nAbout going into office full time as ever being a thing up until the executive order. Someone please help me. I‚Äôm freaking out. ",

Is there something wrong with me? Even all throughout college the problem persisted and it doesn‚Äôt change whether it‚Äôs on a call or in person. The same happens except it‚Äôs probably worse on calls because I end up leaving a lot of silence in-between pauses making the call more awkward. I‚Äôm just tired of it at this point and while I have a very small group of close longtime friends (people in which this still happens with) it makes me still weary of being able to make any more meaningful relationships because I feel weird sometimes with the ones I have already with friends and family nonetheless others because I just end up being more of an asshole because of said conversation skills, because I don‚Äôt talk I just stay quiet and end up looking like I‚Äôm constantly pissy and judging.

Well I've had panic attacks before and lemme tell ya, this one was no joke. Literally thought I was dying.

    "selftext": "\nSo recently ive been feeling a lot of intense emotions that make me feel super uncomfortable. As a background for the past few years I‚Äôve loved reading all kinds of romance books. I‚Äôve read like a bunch of series at this point lol. I‚Äôve reread most of them once or twice. But for the past 2 months, I‚Äôve been constantly rereading 2 books that are part of a series. and when I say reread, I mean like everyday I‚Äôm rereading parts of these books multiple times a day. I did it with one book a few weeks ago and now I‚Äôm onto the second one recently this past week with me mostly rereading many parts of the book so many times a day. Idk. But that‚Äôs not the worst part for me. The worst part is how deeply and uncomfortably I‚Äôve been feeling emotions in reaction to certain things lately. like for example today I was scrolling through tiktok and there was a video about a scene from one of the books I‚Äôve been rereading constantly, and the music in the background kind of had this nostalgic vibe to it. idk why, but when I listened to it, I just felt this horrible feeling that I can only describe as uncomfortable nostalgia bc the song made me feel some type of way that I absolutely hated but can barely describe. I had to stop listening to the video bc it was too much for me to handle. What worries me so much is that this isn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôve felt this intense uncomfortable feeling and it‚Äôs only been happening recently. A few weeks ago I made a post about how I saw videos on tiktok about a nuclear disaster and I got this intense horrible feeling again that I could only barely describe. I‚Äôve never felt this way about tragic events that happen. I obviously felt empathy but I was never feeling like this. The reason I‚Äôm so scared is because this has only been happening more recently with that as well as that video earlier today making me feel this way. I‚Äôm crying as I‚Äôm writing this because I‚Äôm just so scared that it‚Äôll only get worse. Idk what‚Äôs wrong with me. some stuff online says it‚Äôs an intrusive uncomfortable feeling but idk. it‚Äôs so bad that when I‚Äôm in the moment of feeling it, it‚Äôs so uncomfortable mentally that I think about if it doesn‚Äôt go away I‚Äôll want to end my life. I just want to be normal. has anyone else experienced intense emotions to stuff? I‚Äôm just so paranoid. I have anxiety disorder and I have for years now but I‚Äôm not sure if this is related because I‚Äôve never experienced intense emotions to stuff before. any response helps guys. ",

    "title": "Did my dad give me ptsd?",
    "selftext": "  \nWarning: Verryyyy long vent/rant\n\nOne thing about having Asian parents and living in a foreign country is having to translate for them. Me and my family have been living in America for over 10 years but my parents still don‚Äòt fully understand English which is just hard for me. Since I‚Äôm the oldest in the family, I‚Äôm expected to be the ‚Äúsmartest‚Äú and ‚Äúresponsible‚Äú out of all my siblings which I get it but it‚Äôs still hard.\n\nSince my parents expect me to be the smartest, they rely on me the most to translate everything to them which leads to the question ‚ÄúDid my dad give me PTSD?‚Äù\n\nMy dad is a truck driver, he delivers things to different parts of the state, and he knows less English than my mom. My mom knows the basics and can communicate and interact with other with no problems. My dad is okay with English I guess, just not the best.\n\nHe, recently, had been having trouble with his work and needed me to help him with a phone call. I was already used to translating for my parents but I still got nervous. I also have anxiety, quite possibly anxiety disorder but I‚Äôm not sure since I haven‚Äôt seen a doctor for it yet because my mom doesn‚Äôt know what anxiety is and if it‚Äôs really that serious (typical Asian mom). I have taken an anxiety disorder test online and it said that I have high anxiety disorder but I‚Äôm not sure if I can trust online tests.\n\nAnyway, back to helping my dads I was pretty nervous. I thought that it would take 20 minutes, maybe an hour. But one hour turned to two hours of translating and 2 hours turned to 3. By now I could have possibly have had 3 anxiety attacks, I was shaking and stuttering because I didn‚Äôt understand what was going on. Sure I know English but some parents need to understand that just cause I go to school and understand English doesn‚Äôt mean that I am 100% efficient in it. It also doesn‚Äôt help that my dad was getting very angry, to the point that he had to take a literal chill pill which just made me even more anxious.\n\nAfter 3 hours on the phone and about 15 different phone calls, I was sweating, trembling, and stuttering a lot. I am just so glad that the places work hours ended meaning that we couldn‚Äôt call them anymore since they closed. Im pretty sure that if the place kept on working, my dad would have made me keep calling. The thing is, even after all that, the problem still hasn‚Äôt been solved and I‚Äôm just afraid that I made it worse.\n\nBut after I was finally excused, I went to my room and tried everything to calm down, I was so scared and my anxiety was at its highest. To be honest, I don‚Äôt think I had ever felt THAT much anxiety before.\n\nNow, when I translate for my mom, I don‚Äôt get too nervous because my mom doesn‚Äôt really get angry like my dad very easily, sure she has anger issues but she doesn‚Äôt really make me feel that horrible. But whenever I translate for my dad, I get super nervous because I‚Äôm afraid that he would yell at me in front of everyone and act like I‚Äôm the most annoying thing in the world.\n\nNow my dad is more of the fun parent, he plays hide and seek with my siblings and is more of the parent that lets us go to sleepovers and stuff. But when he gets mad, I get TERRIFIED.\n\nI also took an online anxiety disorder test and an online ptsd test. I took an anxiety personality test and it said that I have high anxiety. It also said that I have 9 different types of anxiety like social, trauma, phobia. My anxiety personalized report said that I have 40% social, 82% separation, 15% phobia, 79% trauma, 12% panic, 22% performance, 48% health and 71% generalized. I took this test on personality-quizzes.com. And then I took another test on anxietycentre.com and for this one it said I have anxiety disorder and the anxiety score range said that my anxiety disorder is HIGH in all uppercase letters in red and my anxiety disorder is 76% so my anxiety disorder score is 76.\n\nI took a ptsd test one clinical partners and it said ‚ÄúThese results indicate that you are experiencing¬†**High to severe impact (61)‚Äú**¬†t There are 4 different ‚Äúimpacts‚Äù the lowest being ‚Äòminimal impact 0-10‚Äô ‚ÄòLow to moderate impact¬†11 - 30‚Äô ‚ÄòModerate to high impact 31 - 50‚Äô and ‚ÄòHigh to severe impact¬†51 - 88‚Äô I got 61 meaning that I am in the High to severe impact.\n\nThis isn‚Äôt the first time my dad made me very anxious, I also remember the time where we were renting a violin for my school and I didn‚Äôt understand that much (I was 9 years old at the time) My dad was asking me what the person behind the counter was saying but I didn‚Äôt understand leading my dad to be angry which made me even more anxious. It got to the point where the person behind the counter actually asked me if I‚Äôm okay. I still can‚Äôt shake that memory away, I was 9 years old but felt like passing out because of how high my anxiety was. There was also the tie we were buying a new fridge, doing some documents, trying to fix the printer, making some other phone calls, translating and translating.\n\nIt has gotten to the point where I get scared every time my dad comes home, like I said, he‚Äôs a truck driver meaning that he‚Äôs out for about 7-10 days out of the house and when he comes back I keep getting nervous and scared that he might ask me to translate for him and make me do it for a few hours. Which makes me feel guilty and frustrated at myself because why would I think about this about my dad? He‚Äôs the one that supports me, takes care of me, takes care of the family, etc but here I am getting scared every time he comes home.\n\nThis was kind of a rant but right now I just need some kind of support doesnt need to be big, just a ‚Äúyour doing great‚Äù ‚Äúeverythings going to be okay‚Äù is enough for me. I don‚Äôt really have friends and the friends I do have, I don‚Äôt feel like telling them all this and being a burden to them. I dont want to tell my parents either because I‚Äôm afraid they won‚Äôt take me seriously and instead get mad at me for thinking like this. I have talked about anxiety with my mom once when we were at the doctors but my mom said that she had no clue what that was so I just kind of dropped it.\n\nAnyway, if you have made it this far then ‚ú®congratulations‚ú® for reading my long rant/vent. I hope you have a great day! üíñüíñüíñüíñ",

I reduced thc and caffeine usage and was feeling a little better everyday. A week after the first one, I had ANOTHER attack. Not as bad since I‚Äôd already been through the first one, but now I was worried. Got checked out by my doctor and my heart was great on the EKG resting hr of 46-48 bpm. \n\nI tried a coffee and it made my day horrible of anxiety. Same with thc immediate regretted it. So now today is day 4 of no caffeine, thc, or Diet Coke. Life is teetering on pointless lol. But seriously my anxiety has been something now I have to manage through deep breathing and praying like I feel terrible. I‚Äôm just hoping all this goes away after a few more days. \n\nI have never written a Reddit post before, so I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôm expecting from this. Just maybe someone to say they have been in my situation or similar I guess. ",

    "selftext": "Just wondering what you guys think. I've been dealing with heart palpitations for a few years now. They first time I noticed was when I smoked weed after a long break while drunk and my heart rate increased quite a bit (wondering if It could be anxiety related).\n\n I made a change in my life and don't smoke weed anymore at all. The only time I notice palpitations is when I exert myself physically. They happen when doing cardio related things usually between (130-170bpm). They only last maximum a few minutes at a time and no pain or anything. Honestly most of the time I would barely notice them if I wasn't thinking about and looking for them. \n\nI went to the doctor a few months ago and got echo, EKG, blood tests, holter monitor and 24 hour blood pressure monitor and haven't heard anything from my doctor, so I assume good news. \n\nAnyway, do you think I should push for a stress test? I will admit I am a little overweight and have been back in the gym consistently over the last few months and been working through them (usually decrease intensity for 30 seconds and they go away) but it is very annoying still and I have anxiety whenever I exert myself physically and have a feeling that doesn't help the palpitations at all. \n\nAnyway thank you very much if you read all this. Would love a second opinion while I wait to get back in to see my doctor. ",

To make a long story short back in 2023 I started taking Prozac. I had a absolutely horrible reaction to it. Tried to tough it out for three weeks and simply couldn‚Äôt manage from then on I have been terrified to take medication. I am in therapy and that has helped. once I came off the medication I finally started doing things again going out with friends going out to eat going grocery shopping, etc. \n\nNow here‚Äôs where my problem lies. I started feeling anxious again in December. I had a really bad bout of vertigo for unknown reasons even went to the hospital. Everything came back all right. But nothing feels the same. I feel like I‚Äôve taken 100 steps back. I went to my doctor with all of my concerns and she took them very seriously. I was ordered to take 16 different blood test everything from vitamin deficiencies to thyroid problems to even autoimmune diseases. I have a laundry list of symptoms, brain fog, head pressure, fatigue, loss of appetite, dizzy, shortness of breath, shaking, tingling in face and neck, tight and sore muscles heart palpitations feeling like I‚Äôm going to pass out, feeling winded standing up, my right eye twitches and get stuck sometimes and I have hot and cold flashes. Sometimes my touch even feels numbed like I can feel but not as much as I think I should. I‚Äôve also been experiencing a lot of derealization or what I think is derealization. I also feel easy overwhelmed and sometimes don‚Äôt feel like I recognize myself or loved ones. I‚Äôve been in therapy for a little over two years and interestingly enough my therapist thinks I might be autistic, which isn‚Äôt a surprise. Could that have anything to do with it?\n\nSo my question is has anyone else experienced this? I know my symptoms are pretty common for anxiety, but where can I go from here? I read that I could get genetic testing done to find out what type of medication might work best for me. I‚Äôd also like to see a psychiatrist along with my therapist but in the meantime, I don‚Äôt know what to do. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. ",

    "selftext": "Dear Reddit, \nI have a question for you. I tried to look it up but the top answers seem to be of the Redpill TM (ed?) variety. And it seems like longer answers get responses here . No shade to you all, especially cause I know that you all struggle with anxiety in a big way. I myself was diagnosed with OCD about three months ago and have decided  to accept that I have a thought disorder. I did a lot of processing of the diagnosis upon when it first happened.\nSo I am sitting outside, and I feel like I have no reason to be outside now that my cigarette is out. That is, I feel that I have no belonging in the world, especially when I am out of my Comfort Zone, which is my bed. (Typical anxiety case) but now it has come to my attention that my sister might have a personality disorder so I sort of feel unsafe around her too. I have just now decided that my exposure therapy is to smoke and then go outside and be around other people. I have noticed that I have a fear of people, especially the idea that people can hear what I am saying or expressing. It should be noted that I am in therapy (both group and individual) and am in the recovery process. I don‚Äôt like getting unbelievably stoned when I go through this process, I just hit the pen once at a time.  \nI don‚Äôt really want to discuss weed as part of the healing process here because I think that is another conversation. And I have decided to post this on multiple forums, so if you see this more times than one I am sorry/apologize. The sun is setting now, and I am writing this outside. \n\nTLDR: So the fear is: I am scared to be outside because I have a fear that I will be attacked or that something violent will happen to me or someone else. The therapist in me asks what is the worst that will happen. My only solace is knowing that this once never happened to me, at least physically. I find it interesting when people write a whole story on their anxiety and never mention their trauma. I am thankful to have the resources to say that I have experienced complex trauma.\nOne of my new solutions has been to start carrying pepper spray on my person no matter what to help with the fear. Is there anyone out there who has gone through this problem, or if not, are there amy thoughts? I don‚Äôt know how to end this. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for reading it. ",

The way im looking at it is, my anxiety isnt getting better but now that im going out and it cant released there, its getting released when im at home instead. Dont know if that makes sense but, DAE? And what should i do?",

    "selftext": "The thought of demoting myself from my current job role comes and goes. Sometimes I‚Äôm really happy where I‚Äôm at and sometimes my brain messes with me so bad that I spiral and want to leave.\n\nBackground: I‚Äôm 33/Single/F, I have been at my job for 5 years now - going on 6 years. I started as a regular rep for 2 years. I was the type of rep to not go above and beyond. I liked to get my work done and leave. Never doing anything extra, always in the background. One day, I saw an opportunity to become a lead trainer rep. As I read the job description, I thought to myself this is definitely something that I‚Äôm able to do. I remember sitting with this team when I first began and LOVED them. It was my favorite part about my new hire process. Someone from the lead training team even reached out to me advising that I go for it because she believed I would make an awesome addition and would fit in great. So I went for it thinking I wouldn‚Äôt get it, just for the heck of it thinking I was competing against some top people. My interview was horrific. When I get nervous, I just laugh and giggle a lot never taking anything serious. To my surprise, I got the lead rep role, a nice increase and it‚Äôs been a long, fun 3 years since then. \n\nMy manager and team are a dream, my manager especially. From the start, she knew that I was very nervous and anxious. She has done whatever she can to slowly help me become more comfortable, confident and grow as a person (I really appreciate it truly, she has the patience of a saint) and if I wanted to ever go into a higher role (NOT GOING TO HAPPEN LOL) she would help with that too.\n\nIt‚Äôs been a journey mentally though. During these 3 years I have dealt with anxiety, anxiety attacks, therapy, imposter syndrome, catastrophizing, ‚Äúmind reading‚Äù ‚Ä¶ you name it. It‚Äôs been so draining. I feel bad for my sister and cousin who always have to hear me cry over the littlest things I deal with a work. They are my rocks. \n\nMy manager has said nothing bad to me about any of my work. She‚Äôs been very supportive, amazing and gives me positive feedback. She is so so nice, I even consider her a friend at this point. I have no write ups or anything bad that would get me fired or anything like that. I think where my job gets to me is when I‚Äôm receiving constructive criticism from my team, when I start comparing myself to ‚Äúsuper stars/heavy hitters‚Äù on my team (when I was never one to go above and beyond to begin with), bringing stuff up and getting rejected, teaching classes/training and being the one to provide THE criticism (I hate hate hate this with a passion), and just dealing with a whole bunch of different personalities (supervisors, managers and directors when I never spoke to them from the start). It‚Äôs mentally exhausting.\n\nSo I could try and demote myself, get a decrease in pay and go back to being a regular rep being comfy, cozy and not being bothered. Or I could stick it out and deal with my rollercoaster of emotions. I feel bad letting down my team, my manager and my family doing this. I feel like a failure as a human with my own personal growth and I‚Äôll go back to struggling financially. I‚Äôm so conflicted and have cried about this so much. I am an insane empath, a people pleaser and can‚Äôt say no. WHAT DO I DO?! ",

    "selftext": "Months ago, I couldn‚Äôt do anything. Once I got caught in my anxiety cycle, I stayed home for a long time. I couldn‚Äôt go to stores, malls, or even get a haircut. I couldn‚Äôt even walk far from home. I was stuck indoors for months.\n\nAfter about three months of this, I decided to buy a scooter. That was the first step. I started going out daily with it, pushing myself to go a little further each day. Slowly, I began doing things I hadn‚Äôt done in ages‚Äîvisiting malls, going to restaurants, getting a haircut, and even taking public transportation. At first, I started small, taking the bus or metro for just 2-3 stops. Gradually, I added more stops until I got used to it.\n\nNow, I can confidently say I‚Äôve made a lot of progress. These days, I can even take trains to other cities and return home without issues. It took me 3-4 months to get here, and when I look back at where I was six months ago, I feel proud of myself. I‚Äôve come so far, and I am definitely a different person now.\n\nHowever, I feel like I‚Äôm stuck at this stage. It‚Äôs been weeks, and I haven‚Äôt made any new progress. There are a few reasons for this. First, I‚Äôm an expat, and I‚Äôve decided to move back to my home country. But I‚Äôve told myself I can‚Äôt leave until I‚Äôve fully managed my anxiety. At the same time, I feel like I can‚Äôt completely overcome it while living here, because I‚Äôve grown to hate it. Honestly, if I could, I would leave this second. But the thought of going to the airport, boarding a plane, and making the journey back still feels overwhelming. That said, I truly believe being back home will help a lot.\n\nI‚Äôve managed to fix so many things. I can now go to places, sit alone comfortably, and use trains, buses, trams, and metros. But I still struggle with being around people I know‚Äîfriends or close ones. Every time they ask me to go out for a drink or a meal, I avoid it. Sometimes, if I‚Äôm already out alone, I‚Äôll call one of them to quickly meet up and say hi, which is nice and helpful. But planning something more structured still feels too much for me.\n\nEven having them visit me gives me a lot of anxiety. Recently, I‚Äôve been able to force myself to allow them over, and I‚Äôve even started to enjoy it at times. But the idea of going out with them‚Äîhaving to sit down, eat, and deal with intrusive thoughts like ‚ÄúWhat if I panic? What if I get sick? How will I escape?‚Äù‚Äîstill holds me back. By the way, nausea is the absolute worst symptom for me.\n\nI feel thsi is my biggest challenge and once I overcome it or manage it i will be able to really enjoy my life again and stop going out alone and really socialize and go places with people i love, I really really miss it and i really want it to work out soon so badly. I also miss dating and going out on dates and meeting people...\n\nMy social life these days is mostly online with people I game with or my friends on discord yes we spend hours and hours together but its not the same as being out and so on, also i have my roommates and as i said before some friends visit from time to time.\n\nI was thinking about talking to a dr for some meds to help me with my healing journey what do u think ? or should i just start forcing myself and say fuck it ? its so hard tho\n\nlastely some days i have anxiety and i spend the day panicking like today cause I keep thinking about when will i leave to my home country ? will i be able to ? what if i cant ? what if i stay stuck and what if I just stay in this cycle?",

    "selftext": "It is so easy these days to feel like your social anxiety is getting worse and worse and that it's your fault. Conversations feel more awkward, eye contact feels harder, and awkward silences are getting longer and longer. But here‚Äôs the thing: it‚Äôs not just you. Social media has twisted the way we socialize, and I honestly think it'll beat us down if we don't acknowledge it.\n\nI've personally been on a long journey of social media addiction and social anxiety. Almost a decade now I've dealt with it. And it's only in the last few years that I realized that the two problems were very closely related.\n\nThink about how often you instinctively reach for your phone during a pause in a conversation or while you‚Äôre spending time with others. How often people do that to you. Social media conditions us to crave constant stimulation, and as a result, silence during conversation feels uncomfortable.\n\nWe're so used to experiencing conversations through a screen, as a passive bystanders. Whether it's streams, shorts, or videos, we aren't used to driving conversations anymore. We're used to watching them.\n\nSo, what can you do? This is a lifelong endeavor, but my best advice is to start small. Set up a grayscale (black and white) filter on your phone during social situations to remind yourself that real life can be beautiful and fun too. I went even further with this: I can't even open social media unless I tell an AI why and for how long I need. The goal is to force yourself slowly to build awareness of how your impulsive phone usage is cutting into your real life relationships.\n\nWhen you start to notice those shifts, it‚Äôs a game changer. You‚Äôll feel more present, more connected, and honestly, more like yourself. Peace of mind during social situations isn't something you‚Äôve lost‚Äîit's just buried under all the noise. So please, from someone who understands the tough combination of phone addiction + social anxiety, consider these things, you won't regret at least giving it a try.",

I've been anxious about social surroundings exams , classes , gatherings etc...  the only way that I can channel that anxiety  by using the restroom (to pee) I've had it hard it's been unbearable because I can't go out without thinking or worrying about using the washroom . I can distract myself from the thought or worry about if I keep constantly talking to someone which does help at times I'm still exploring that option but there are sometimes where it doesn't work. It gets worse sometimes  at an exam because once I use the restroom I don't know where else to channel my anxiety that becomes horrible I tend to become restless (my mouth going dry , my breath going fast etc)and I've walked out of the exam room twice because of this. It's not just affected my academic life but personal and social life too I've stopped going out much even to a friend's place because I'm worried about what they'd think about me constantly using the restroom even though they say it doesn't matter but it does to me . I try soo hard to correct it step by step going alone to grocery stores or have a walk (instead of going on a vehicle)but there's always a sudden trigger but if I get distracted I forget about it completely.\n\nI did seek help from a psychiatrist who prescribed some tablets  to consume on a daily basis and some meds to use on SOS basis it does help a little but not much .Started going to therapy but couldn't keep going .\n\nI don't want to be like this. I've lost a lot of time ,passed on a lot of events that I genuinely wanted to take part in.. I try hard every time but somehow it always gets messed up and my friends get upset with me at times because I don't come out (movies, outings etc) they always say they're okay they don't mind but it's tiring for me it really is !once the feeling starts it literally takes a physical toll on me they'll never understand how tiring of an experience it is to hold myself together... And I don't want to live like this anymore it hurts me a lot because I used to be a comfortable person outside before the lockdown. I just want to get back up on my feet again.",

    "selftext": "Disclaimer: This is not a cry for help/doing this for attention and maybe posting this in the r/Anxiety subreddit isn‚Äôt the best place. I‚Äôve suffered from severe anxiety and depression for YEARS. I‚Äôm currently medicated (klonopin,propranolol, mirtazepine,quetiapine). The ONLY medicine that has ‚Äúhelped‚Äù me up to this point, and that has been most affective: you probably guessed it, Klonopin. I‚Äôve reached tolerance as I take 2.5mg and it doesn‚Äôt do anything anymore. I‚Äôm not increasing as my doctor said that if I reached a certain dosage, he would taper me off. I‚Äôve been tapered off benzos twice before and it‚Äôs mentally/psychically painful. So, I‚Äôve decided that I‚Äôm going to end my own life. I‚Äôve done everything under the sun over the years. Therapy, meditation, exposure, cbd, and whole list of other medications (not gonna list them because there‚Äôs so many). I‚Äôve battled my fights but have lost the war. Anxiety and Depression have ultimately won. I‚Äôm going to eat my favorite food, play my favorite game, and watch my favorite movie before I decide to end it. The human condition was never meant for some people (myself included). I‚Äôm also going to visit my mother one last time as she is the closet family I have. Yes, I know this will hurt the people around me but I will be forgotten eventually as this is nature of things. Yes, I‚Äôve been into a psych ward and it did nothing so admitting myself wouldn‚Äôt help. I don‚Äôt eat and I don‚Äôt sleep. If death is eternal sleep then it‚Äôs a luxury I can afford. No more stress about my mental health problems or bills or even holding a job. I don‚Äôt expect ANYONE to feel sympathy or pity for me as I‚Äôm just another number. The world is overpopulated as is so I‚Äôm doing the world and universe a favor. I‚Äôm writing this to leave ‚Äúsomething behind‚Äù as the internet is forever and we as humans have a limited lifespan. I will write a psychical letter as well that someone will find, hopefully, explaining the situation about my absence from any phone calls or messages as they will not hear from me in person ever again. Kudos to the many individuals on here that suffer and get through it each day. And before anyone points the finger and says that I‚Äôm ‚Äúselfish‚Äù for this, go fuck yourself, you haven‚Äôt lived my upbringing, childhood, or negative experiences that have plagued me up until this point. Life is all about choices and this is a choice I‚Äôve come to terms with and decided for myself as an 28 year old male. Death is something WE ALL have in common, I‚Äôm just wanting to retire from life early. Nothing right or wrong about it. It is a choice. ",

So I think I may have some sort of anxiety disorder. \n\nTo the point of this post, one thing I've noticed that's unbearably frustrating is a lurching, butterfly-adjacent warm feeling I get in my upper stomach or diaphragm. It's more noticeable when I'm actively worrying about something but throughout the day as I'm working or doing completely mundane tasks I notice that I have this feeling very often, a sudden warm lurching feeling in my gut that makes my heart rate go up and causes me to feel like I need to sit down and take a deep breath. It feels like breathing deeply should fix it but rarely does. What is this feeling? Is it an anxiety thing? It definitely feels like a symptom of anxiety or a panic attack but most of the time I can manage that sort of thing with stuff like meditation and breathing exercises. This doesn't really go away, even when I'm feeling calm. I don't think it's a symptom of a health condition or anything, just because I don't have any underlying illnesses and I'm in decent physical health.

I just wanted to share my story in the hopes that it helps put some of you who may be experiencing the dental anxiety I've been experiencing at ease. \n\nI joined this page because I was diagnosed with advanced periodontal disease two weeks ago and was advised that I would need to undergo scaling and planing to avoid the risk of losing my teeth. \n\nTo say that I was TERRIFIED is an understatement. As a journalist I am always traveling and had honestly not been to the dentist in years. I only went to the dentist two weeks ago because I starting having trouble with one of my front teeth and it felt like it would \"shift\" a little if I pressed on it. That terrified me so I called a local dentist who said I would need some pretty advanced periodontal treatment. \n\nOver the last two weeks I've made myself sick worrying about what to expect. I'd never had any sort of periodontal work done before and the fear of the unknown, specifically the thought of the PAIN, had me on the brink of a nervous breakdown. But knowing I had no other choice, I went today and had the scaling and root planing done. \n\nI. WAS. SHOCKED.I was expecting to have to be numbed up with shots all over my mouth or at LEAST be numbed with a topical gel for the torture I was sure awaited me. I also expected it to take several hours, based on the reddit threads I had read. NEITHER turned out to be the case. \n\nMy dentist didn't even have to numb me and the process to do my entire mouth took less than 45 minutes. He used an ultrasonic scaler, which he said is much faster and much more efficient than a traditional cleaning tool and it caused literally ZERO PAIN. \n\nI have to go back in 2 weeks for a follow up, again in 3 months for another cleaning and then he said I would probably only have to go back in every 6 months for maintenance. I am SO RELIEVED I didn't let my fear stop me from saving my teeth.\n\nI am literally the BIGGEST BABY IN THE WORLD and have a VERY low tolerance for pain so if I can do it YOU can do it. The technology they have today is a total game changer.\n\nPLEASE don't let your fear stop you from saving your teeth AND your health. Just GO! \n\nHope this helps someone out there. ",

There is nothing I can pinpoint that causes this and it doesn‚Äôt feel like a panic attack (unless it‚Äôs a certain type of panic attack with no clear cause or reason for panic). It happens almost daily, and mostly comes up when I‚Äôm closing up the shop after a shift, or if I‚Äôve been walking around shops all day, or on the way back from work. Doing these things are not necessarily stressful to me and I don‚Äôt understand why this would cause these symptoms. Maybe I forget to take deep breaths or something but I just think the symptoms are kind of extreme?\n\nWeirdly it all goes away when I lay flat on my back (not my front, or side, or when I sit down, literally only when I lay down on my back) and it comes back straight away if I sit/ stand up again? This is the ONLY method I have of fixing it and it‚Äôs only temporary. Plus I can‚Äôt exactly just lie down in public.\n\nDoes anyone know what on earth this could be, and what causes it? Or has anyone else experienced this?\n\nThanks :)",

However, when I was waking up and in recovery, I tried to ask for water, and my throat was so dry (I think they intubated me, but no one would confirm it to me >:( so I'm not positive) that it was hard to get the words out. The nurse in recovery screamed at me that she couldn't understand me and could I just shut up and stop trying to talk so she could do her work. I was still unable to move and this experience made me feel so unsafe. There were a few other bad experiences during this surgery, like hearing the medical team talking about me like I wasn't there while I was still awake and a few other things.\n\nI have had several panic attacks, including vomiting and numbness in my limbs from hyperventilating just thinking about having another surgery.\n\nI can't convince myself I want surgery, I don't trust my medical care team, and I feel like if anyone touches me while I'm helpless I'll feel dirty and violated and I just want to end it all rather than live in a body that's been violated like that by strangers. \n\nMy surgeon has said I could do an epidural if being under general anesthesia would be bad. Has anyone had success with fear like this? How did you get help for dealing with it? Especially anyone who has had an epidural for a surgery. It's gotten to the point that it's all I think about and my daily life is very affected.\n\nEdit: I know you can get anxiety medication beforehand, but from experience I beat myself up afterwards for anything I let them do while not \"sober\" and myself.

I didn't realize the panic attacks i had when I was younger were panic attacks. \n\nOver the years I sought therapists and they didn't help at all so over the years I did what I could to either minimize occurrences or manage it if it happened. I figure it worked because it hasn't happened in years or at least I can't remember when it happened last. \n\nI still get anxiety sporadically or rather have episodes now and then where I'll have plans to go do something I want to do and then I'll dread doing it, a random worrying thought will pop into my head and I'll get anxiety about it and it will just take over if i don't manage it right away, the occasional sense of impending doom etc. \n\nFor the most part it's been infrequent it hasn't put a damper on my day to day life. \n\nBut more recently I think I've had very mild attacks the past two days. Both times it was at night and it was a couple of hours or so before my bed time and I was watching TV. \n\nI started panicking and having anxiety for no reason. I was having rapid heart beat (not too rapid but faster than my normal), anxiety about doom, then I sorted felt that faint feeling starting to happen etc. \n\nProblem was even tho it was mild the past two days it took longer for me to settle down than I remember it ever taking and I remember feeling like if i don't distract myself my anxiety will just take over again so I kept trying different things to distract myself: breathing, grounding, meditation etc. Took a while but eventually things went back to normal after the symptoms finally subsided. \n\nHas this happened to you while relaxing and it happened out of no where for no reason. \n",

I lost the most important years of my life, where my self-growth lied the most. I and my people have been trying to recover from it. Every time we get a little better, something else comes along the way and we're back on step 1. It's been gruelling, not just mentally but physically too. I can't go in detail regarding what exactly went wrong cause the list is long, but I really want to know what the reason was. Everything seemed to be good until 2020, I was doing well in school. Everything started going downhill when the pandemic started. I got diagnosed with OCD, anxiety and what not. Gets to my head every time I think about it cause I know I wasn't a person who'd just get swallowed by such things. I was confident and happy. Nothing happened that could have led me to becoming so paranoid either. Not just that but my loved ones also suffered. Each one of us kept getting sick or hurt. Again and Again. It's like start of a new month brought new worries and challenges. This continues. What I'm curious about is if someone is casting any spells on us for this to keep occuring. Is someone performing any sort of magic for this to happen, cause I don't want to live in fear or delusion anymore. I don't know what to believe anymore and my judgement is clouded. I don't know who to trust anymore. I want answers and I need to find an escape. Is black magic real, if it is what do I do to get out of it. I can't see this anymore. It's exhausting. ",

The doctor suggested I have a therapist or journal to my thoughts, but my parents refused. \n\nI grew up with extremely controlling and ultimately abusive strict parents, who raised me to be dependent and locked me in the house for years. They say it's useless to teach me to drive, it's useless for me to get a job, and don't allow me to call or hang out with others. I just turned 18 so I am a senior in high school and can't just run away because I want to make sure I graduate to have a better future for myself. \n\nThis puts a ton of pressure on me as time is running out and most of my peers have been driving since 15 or 16, and I am the only one due to parents who say it isn't worth it to show someone like me how.\n\nWorse, I left my first girlfriend of 1.4 years because of about a week ago because of constantly toxic behavior and essentially cheating, and I have to deal with that all alone because my family doesn't support me having relationships and therefore I don't have many friends either. She was my best friend and my love but I can't let someone walk all over me like that and cheat regardless of how highly I thought of them, which hurts. But there is a huge void in my life without her.\n\nI'm also coming to terms with the fact that my family's treatment of me has given me severe religious trauma--which feels good to finally admit, but at the same time, I feel extreme guilt and fear constantly, and feel extremely afraid of God and death to the point of near panic attacks. \n\nLastly, I'm aware I was born with a rare intersex condition that surfaces in puberty but my parents won't allow me to be taken to a doctor about it. They did take me to a general pediatrician about it once and she confirmed that I most likely have one of a few conditions but that further testing would be required and said I should be referred to a specialist--to which my parents never did. \nThey raised me female, but I have always thought I was male, and male matches my physical body much better. (This condition is essentially the root of their abuse, saying it isn't real and that I brought it upon my self to spite God, although I was always quite religious and it is impossible for it to be my fault.) \n\nThis condition gives me further health issues and I really want to seek help I'm running out of hope and this gives me an even worse sense of anxiety and panic. I wanted to be checked out to finally know exactly what it is and what options I have before I start university but I'm afraid I won't.\n\nAll four of these things are driving me crazy, and I just want any advice or a positive word. I can't see a doctor or a therapist. I hate to admit I have anxiety but this is my stand for myself. Does anyone have any advice, even for at least one of these stressors? Thank you all for your help.\n\nI normally would stay positive under pressure but with so much going on I can't seem to anymore. Any advice would mean the world to me.\n\nGood luck to you all and I hope you all find peace and relief from your own anxiety\n",

For context, I am a 19 year old girl and I have a younger brother who was diagnosed with Autism a few years ago. I didn‚Äôt think I could be autistic because a lot of his struggles are very different from mines. He is nonverbal and only likes specific things and food. I am very social but I often find myself in awkward situations and I cannot understand sarcasm. I also have a strong sense of justice and I get very anxious when going against the rules. I feel guilty looking up answers on google for homework. I am emotionally dysregulated and I cry so easily but I thought that was linked to my GAD. I recently became more aware of my autistic traits by my best friend who pointed them out. I have struggled with anxiety for as far as I can remember from childhood but I was told by my school‚Äôs psychologist that it was due to my anxiety and PTSD. I was told I was very empathetic because I easily can feel what others are feeling and it‚Äôs almost as if I am the one getting hurt instead when I see someone else cry or get hurt. Thus she didn‚Äôt think I could have Autism. Until I recently talked to my new therapist and I felt so seen. She explained how broad the spectrum is and referred me to get an official ASD assessment. I am just wondering now if I am Autistic does that mean my struggles this whole time have been due to being neurodivergent or is it possible that my GAD is independent of being autistic?

It's embarassing to even type these lines, but I just don't know what to do. It feels like being away from my wife is breaking me. \n\nI (38F) had my fair share of anxiety through my life, but I tend to always be the positive, glass is always half-full and everything-will-be-ok kind of person, who never felt homesick, not even when moving to a different country, leaving all friends and family behind. \nRecently my wife's job changed, and the new position comes with days she has to spend away from home. \nLogically, it should be nothing. We're adults, so surely I'll be fine spending 24+ hours without her. I work from home and I have plenty of hobbies, projects and activities to keep me busy, so I thought it's gonna be like every normal day when she goes to work, she'll just come home the next day. But knowing she's not coming home for the day feels like a switch in my brain is turned on and I'm filled with irrational anxiety over her absence. It's honestly scary.\n None of my loved activites can hold my attention, I lose appetite, feeling nauseus and lightheaded, trembling and breaking down crying as if she was gone forever. I know she's not, and that my reaction is borderline ridicolous but I can't control it or reason with myself. \nDeep down I know I'm blowing things out of proportion, but my brain just keep signaling what if scenarios of her getting hurt and what if this was the last time I've seen her and she'll never come home. It's stupid and I'm trying to cope with breathing techniques or distracting myself but in the end I always just end up in a panic attack or a breakdown.\n\nAnd now, she'll be gone for several days in a row and I'm already dreading how it'll affect me. We text and call whenever we can, which is always soothing, but the moment they stop, it's back to doom and gloom. \nI don't know how to handle this, and I don't want to be overly clingy or make my wife feel like I'm smothering her with my neediness. I'm super proud of her achievements at her career and I'd never want to get in the way of her happiness, so I'm just trying to play things down and pretend I'm okay, otherwise I know she'd blame herself or feel guilty...\nI've been trying to look for solutions online, but so far I keep falling short, so here I am, hoping that anyone who experienced similar has some tips or advice for me, that can help me to learn to cope better.

First of all, this is a way of ‚Äúrunning away from your fears‚Äù but I still do it so it‚Äôs your choice.\n\nSTEP 1:\nSend an email to your teacher being completely honest and explaining your anxiety, politely ask if you can present to just them seperate from the class. Most teachers would do this & you can now stuff so much details on to it for a better grade without worrying about yapping too much.\n\nSTEP 2:\nIf your teacher is not budging respectfully say that you will complete the presentation and just not present it. So fill out the slides and submit, and just not get the presenting points, (for my school is usually 10-20% off.) I‚Äôve only ever had to do this once since most teachers are used to letting students present alone but I‚Äôve came to the conclusion that sticking it out and thinking about it for weeks, and then presenting and getting a good grade is just not worth it for me.\n\nNow I never want to say to not care about your grades but when I have chosen to not present, I still got a C, and all the other chiller projects brought it back up. Now in my head I know that the outcome will never be me presenting, so all of my anxiety goes away about it.\n\nJust to clarify, my anxiety would make me throw up, Yes I did talk to many counselors and therapists, but this is what works for me.",

    "selftext": "Long story short, I keep getting this feeling that I won‚Äôt be around in the future. Like I see a new movie is coming out in 2026 and I think, what about if I never see that movie because I won‚Äôt be here. And this is becoming a common thing crossing my mind. More and more recently. \n\nI‚Äôve had anxiety since I can remember but I was always more social based, thinking people were looking at me in public etc. In October 2023 one day I just woke up and couldn‚Äôt move. Was diagnosed with rheumatoid Arthritis. I was living in Cambridge at the time, just started my second year at University, I was doing good. And I had to give it all up and move back home. I was bedridden and in agony the whole of 2024. Somewhere around the beginning of 2024, my mental health heavily declined. I became depressed because of my situation. I started having panic attacks and ever time I did I was 100% convinced I was going to die. My mental health was out of control. When my doctors were planning my arthritis medication they found out I had a fatty liver so this is something else I now had to fix. \n\nI‚Äôve finally started taking medications for my arthritis now. So I‚Äôm not bedridden although I‚Äôm still in pain, still uncomfortable, still have flare ups etc. but at least I‚Äôm not bedridden anymore. My panic attacks aren‚Äôt as often and my mental health is improving. It‚Äôs baby steps but I‚Äôm slowly healing from this. I‚Äôm applying to go back to university in September, hopefully I get in. I‚Äôm gradually working things out. \nMy mental health is still a bit üòµ‚Äçüí´üò¨ü´†I have arthritis in my whole body so I‚Äôm always getting these random stabs of pain and when they are around my chest and surrounding area it scares the hell out of me. I immediately want to freak out and run to A&E. I also have heart burn and acid reflux which can cause some scary symptoms. Obviously with my general health anxiety I‚Äôm still trying to work on this but struggling.\n\nAnd the new thing I‚Äôve noticed is this scary feeling I won‚Äôt be around. Like when I see the movie release dates, or make future plans, it‚Äôs like this voice sneaks in and says but what about if you never get to see/do that because you‚Äôre not here. \n\nSitting here planning for uni, planning voluntary work, work experiment, course plans etc. and thinking about my future and the things I want to do is causing my mind to stir. I‚Äôm sitting here scaring myself. My anxious thoughts are driving me nuts.\n\nI‚Äôm only 20, turning 21 in Feb. And I just can‚Äôt carry on like this. The health anxiety and thinking I‚Äôm always having a heart attack is bad enough without these thoughts keep creeping in. Like I‚Äôm running out of time. Somethings ganna happen. After the past year and so I‚Äôve had I can‚Äôt keep dealing with this. Even typing this makes me want to freak out and cry. Before the arthritis I never dealt with any of this and now I just can‚Äôt get rid of it. \n\nI even started watching a series called ‚Äòskins‚Äô a couple days ago and all the death/ health problems the characters were going through was triggering me. It was making my mind race. I was going to bed and staying up for hours thinking about these things. I had to switch to another series. It‚Äôs like I fully cannot control it. \n\nI‚Äôm trying to pick up the pieces of my life and put them back together but my brain is being my biggest enemy. \n\nWhat do I do? \n\n",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone! I‚Äôm hoping I can find some people who can relate, almost like a support group on here. I‚Äôm sure some will leave some negative comments, but that‚Äôs the internet. So most of my life I‚Äôve had pretty bad anxiety (I‚Äôm 35 now) and it flares up occasionally (agoraphobia, panic attacks, fight or flight feelings). It got worse in my late 20s when I opened a spa with my mom, then slowly got better (I always liked the thought of being my own boss since I get hormonal migraines it‚Äôs easier being able to rest/‚Äúcall out‚Äù)(or so I thought). We sold the salon 7 years later, and I decided to stay in the marketing field and go back to school. So I am in school now virtually with SNHU. Two years ago I was working a remote job that I quit after a year and a half because the boss was horrible (constantly threatening me and my coworker with firing us for things that were beyond our control). I didn‚Äôt realize how difficult the job market is! It took me about a year to find another remote position and I only worked there for two months because this boss was even worse! I couldn‚Äôt say ‚Äúokay‚Äù I had to say ‚Äúyes sir‚Äù he constantly was flipping out about a previous employee that had cancer and if she saved a file name wrong he would freak out about it until the end of time. I thought, this is my karma for thinking the grass is greener somewhere else! I started getting panic attacks again I couldn‚Äôt do it anymore. I‚Äôd go to sit on the computer and I‚Äôd shake and get dizzy knowing he‚Äôd call me to yell at me about something I wasn‚Äôt trained on. So anyway, I‚Äôm back to able to do school full time again and unfortunately looking for another position. But I am taking this time to also try new anxiety medications which I am super nervous about (Cymbalta). Basically what I‚Äôd like to know is if there is anyone out there that can relate to me. That has really bad anxieties that flare up, and migraines that make it hard to keep a job. It would be so nice to know I‚Äôm not alone. Don‚Äôt be too hard on me (I am seeing a therapist and psychiatrist). Thank you so much for listening!",

    "selftext": "Contains vague talk of medical things, but is not specifically related to medical anxiety.  May still be upsetting/triggering in this regard though!\n\n\n\nHello all, recently my partner has been dealing with serious (but not life-threatening) medical problems related to his eyes, and is undergoing treatment.  We both have anxiety disorders, and both have a habit of feeding off of the other's.\n\nBetween insurance companies being as difficult as possible, his job being as difficult as possible about leave approval for appointments, and then, you know, the actual process, fears, processing, etc...  I am not handling it well.  (He is not either but I'm not here to speak for him)\n\nI have just been absolutely emotionally overwhelmed for days, weeks.  Waking up with my heart pounding, expecting bad news in every message or strange look.  Panic attacks.  Catastrophizing.  Often on the verge of tears.  I still manage to get through my work day, but I feel like I'm screaming into a void, because I feel like I can't talk to anyone about this (it's not my stuff to share + everyone in my circle is dealing with their own things, and I don't want to burden them further with just my aimless anxiety), and I feel bad feeling bad because it doesn't feel like I have the right.  I also don't really have any local friends to go out with (making friends is just so hard!).  I don't want him to have to feel like he's taking care of me or worrying about me, but I also absolutely cannot hide it (and don't REALLY want to because I know it's counterproductive).\n\nIt just gets worse when I see him stressed out, because I feel bad for him, which makes me spiral even more.  But I obviously would never ask him to not show it either, so I know that it's my -reaction- that is the issue.  But I just can't control it.\n\nI know I have problems/a history of being a feelings manager.  I want my friends to have a good time, I want to do the things that I know won't upset people.  I have recognized this more recently, and I know that ultimately I am not responsible for how other people react to things... But not internalizing that is easier said than done.\n\nI have mostly just been trying to distract myself, because I know that I have no direct, actionable impact in this situation.  I try to be supportive, give hugs, make good dinners, listen, etc., and that's probably all that I can do.  But it's also slowly just eating away at me as well, and I feel like I just have to sit in it and suffer, because I'm not actually the person who is going through anything.\n\nI don't currently have a therapist, tho I have had a couple in the past.  They helped to varying degrees and equipped me with tools that usually do ok for me overall, for smaller triggers, or just general anxiety.  But as soon as there is a real, logical cause of stress/anxiety, I just become totally incapable of coping, probably because a lot of those tools involve putting things into perspective/using logic to recognize it's anxiety talking.  That just doesn't work for me when there are actual, real, tangible events happening.\n\nTldr: I'm overwhelmed by stress/anxiety caused by medical things with my partner, who is also overwhelmed.  I don't know how to cope with anxiety with a tangible cause, regardless of not being able to have any real effect on it.\n\nWhile any tips would be lovely, even just knowing I'm not alone here would also mean the world.",

Lately, it has become harder to manage, and the usual things I try, like journaling or meditating, do not seem to work as well anymore. I feel stuck in a cycle of anxious thoughts and overanalyzing every little detail.\n\nI was searching for a best app for overthinking, because there are quite a few of them, most of them were fine, but it seemed that they didn‚Äôt quite have everything I need in 1 place, and of course all are paid with subscriptions. So, researching I found this mindway app, which claims to help with overthinking and anxiety through guided meditations, thought exercises, and personalized plans, exactly what I had in mind. The idea of a structured approach sounds appealing, but I am unsure if it is more effective than what I have already been doing on my own, plus its paid subscription.\n\nHas anyone used the app? Does it genuinely help break the cycle of overthinking and offer actionable insights, or does it feel like just another tool that does not bring real change? Any experiences or advice would be great.\n\nTIA",

My husband and I were watching a new show we started so we continued it until bed time. We went to bed around 1 am and then just as I was falling asleep I started having horrible anxiety. I jolted up and was shaking/trembling but then I started having racing thoughts and my breathing quickened so I knew I was having a panic attack at that point. I am ALWAYS afraid to take any new medication I haven‚Äôt taken before because I fear the side effects or it making my symptoms worse. I didn‚Äôt want to deal with another night of no sleep because I was already so tired, so I quite literally said F it and just took half of my 25 mg Hydroxyzine. I didn‚Äôt want to take the full amount in case it knocked me out to the point I would be super sluggish in the morning or sleep through my alarm so I just took 12.5 mg. I was terrified of what was going to happen but I just told myself ‚Äúyou know what? Whatever happens, happens. I can always just go to the ER if it makes everything worse.‚Äù Within 30 min my panic attack completely stopped and I fell right asleep and even better yet I didn‚Äôt have any crazy or creepy dreams that make me feel anxious right as I wake up in the morning. For some this might be such a small victory, but for me this was the biggest leap I‚Äôve taken on my own in such a long time. ",

    "selftext": "So, I basically can't eat anymore.\n\nIt started in october where suddenly i got a stomach ache and terrible nausea out of the blue. It got so bad that the following panic attack sent me to the ER (hurray for emetophobia).\n\nAfter this i didn't eat for a day or two, because i was so scared to get sick again. Ever since, my stomach has been in shambles. Pain, nausea, no appetite whatsoever. Sometimes there would be days that i would be able to eat somewhat normally, but then the day after the pain and the nausea would be back. Of course, this is causing weightloss, and I didn't weigh much to begin with. This makes me even more anxious as I get scared that there's something wrong (like cancer or something). While everyone (probably rightfully) points out, girl you don't eat, ofcourse you're losing weight.\n\nIt's now almost february and it still hasn't gotten any better. I had bloodwork and imaging done and the doctors couldn't find anything wrong. My doctor referred me to a psychologist, but the waittimes are brutal, i'll have starved before I can get an appointment. I'm becoming desperate. I want to not constantly feel sick, or be in pain anymore. I want to be able to eat and enjoy food again. I can't even remember the last time I felt hungry.\n\nI have had short episodes of this before, but never to this extend (both in length and severity).\n\n  \nIs there anyone else who struggles/struggled with the same issue?

    "title": "Sudden anxiety coupled with fatigue & brain fog, is this common? Will it get better?",
    "selftext": "Hi there, I'm sorry if I format this badly at all, I'm not used to posting on Reddit in general & I'm not sure if this is the right flair or even sub :').\n\nAs a bit of background I recently turned 19M, and throughout my childhood as far as I can remember I've had what I would describe as 'mild' social anxiety (in the sense that I'd never really had a panic attack before). I would avoid speaking/performing infront of others, crowded places, and had trouble in IRL social situations, though I've always been pretty social online and voice chatting has never been a problem. I could always mask this anxiety for the most part when needed and I've spent my entire childhood staring at screens and playing video games in my spare time instead of going outside so I never seeked help back then.\n\nComing up to more recently, I suddenly started feeling some majorly uncomfortable and frightening symptoms such as brain fog, insane fatigue all day, and what I would say are the beginnings of panic attacks before I can calm myself down/distract myself. It started around a month ago, where suddenly I had trouble thinking, I felt like my head was constantly blank, and it would cause alot of worry. I would also be yawning and extremely tired by 2-4pm every day (which I still am). I attempted to nap whenever this sleepiness happened but I would find myself laying in bed with my eyes closed for hours on end without being able to fall asleep. I immediately reduced all my caffeine intake and made my diet much better as a result of this, hoping that was the issue. I have gone from drinking a Monster energy drink every morning & exclusively pepsi/coke throughout the day to drinking one coffee in the morning and only water. This unfortunately has not really solved my issue, though I'm now making it to the night and getting 8-10 hours of sleep almost every day by powering through it.\n\nFollowing around a week of this, I contacted my GP (a sort of doctor in the UK) with my symptoms who went on to check my thyroid etc in a blood test, which all came back normal. I continued to suffer with these symptoms alongside some new 'panic attack' problem I started having. I would be walking through a supermarket looking at things on the shelves and thinking to myself 'I should be getting ingredients for meals, what meals should I be getting? Why am I just aimlessly staring at things? Why am I not thinking/why is my head blank?' which immediately followed up with a lightheaded feeling, my heart/chest 'dropping', and my legs feeling weak. I started to walk quickly whilst leaning on the trolley, and tried my best to entirely focus on one item to the next until I could get out of there as fast as possible. It felt like I was on the edge of passing out, and even with intentional breathing, I would end up thinking to myself 'Why am I intentionally breathing? Oh yeah, the feeling I just had...' and it would rush back. I ended up getting out of the store and my girlfriend kept my mind occupied by yapping to me on the way home. This type of incident has happened 3 times in the past month, every time in a shop, and every time triggered by my own thoughts and worries about said thing happening again.\n\nSince these events, I contacted the GP again, who this time referred me to CBT and encouraged me to improve my BMI (I'm overweight for my height but by no means immobile/extremely overweight) to aid my mental health. Alongside this they also booked me in for another blood test to check cortisol/testosterone, if I remember correctly, which is in around 3 weeks from now. I got the call for CBT after self referring and I am now on a \\~5 month waiting list.\n\nI can't think of a specific trigger that could've caused all of this. The closest I can think is at the end of the month prior to the symptoms beginning, I had tried a THC vape with my girlfriend and took too many puffs (being a non-cannabis consumer) and ended up in a '3-day bed ridden brain fog recovery session'. During that time I got very poor sleep, felt dizzy all the time, head spinning, would space out and experience the brain fog etc. This was absolutely terrifying for me but after a few days it cleared up and I seemed okay for the weeks to follow. I'm aware my current anxiety is likely caused by the fear of experiencing said anxiety, and it's a cycle that really sucks. But I also wonder if those terrible few days could have caused a heightening in my pre-existing 'mild' anxiety that was delayed and has only appeared recently. And again, maybe I'm making my current situation worse by relating it to those few days... who knows T\\_T. I would also like to say that I do not drink alcohol, or do any sort of drugs, and I had only tried one of these vapes as a way of destressing from normal life things (moving out time, work, etc) which was admittedly very very stupid. I feel immense guilt already & while I appreciate any replies being honest, please don't lay into me too much for it :').\n\nI've looked into all of this, and even resorted to going into details about all of these symptoms with an AI to 'soft diagnose' myself to give me some answers, and I think it really is just anxiety, and I'm doing it to myself. I would just like to know if anyone else here has had a similar experience, how they're doing with it, maybe experience with CBT relating to the experience? I'm not sure. I would just like some comfort in honest answers, and most of all I'd like to ask if I might ever be able to return to normal daily activities like shopping or work without fear of having a panic attack, or if I'm just going to have to endure the attacks and learn not be so drained, terrified, and debilitated by them in the moment.   \n  \nThank you so much for reading all of this, it truly means alot, and thank you to anyone who might reply and answer any of my questions.",

Everyone says I have immunity now but I only have that immunity to the strain I had, not every single strain.  I know the window of getting symptoms after exposure is up to 48 hours. I work every other day! Once I‚Äôm out of the window for exposure on Monday, I work! So I‚Äôm in the window again üò≠ I couldn‚Äôt eat much today and I‚Äôve been going to the bathroom multiple times an hour. I‚Äôm exhausted. I cannot tell when I‚Äôm gonna throw up or when I‚Äôm just panicking. I feel like I‚Äôm just counting down until it happens. I know I just have to push on through. If I get sick, I get sick. I‚Äôve done it before, and I can do it again. And if it is anxiety, I‚Äôve also done that before and I can do it again as well. \n\nIt‚Äôs just so stressful üò≠ is there anything you guys recommend eating/drinking that you use when you‚Äôre nauseous/anxious? My mom has these lollipops for nausea and they work but I don‚Äôt like candy usually.",

    "selftext": "First time posting here but I need to talk about this\n\nI‚Äôm taking APUSH and am one of four students who were allowed to take it two years early. Previously I have had no experience with test anxiety, I could go in and get an A every time in every class. It has been my goal to be Valedictorian, something that I‚Äôm pretty sure is a goal I share with like two other people which was my main motivation in taking the class early to pace myself on getting all my AP‚Äôs done. First term of APUSH I did great and got an A+, 100% on the dbq final. However, I noticed myself having a lot more anxiety before, during, and after tests. This term is a whole other story as some of the people in my class are like on another level of gifted. I‚Äôve always been smart but had to work at it more than a lot of my peers in advanced classes. Every discussion I‚Äôve been filled with anxiety and beat myself up over answering questions. I don‚Äôt get along with my teacher great who seems completely puzzled by the amount of questions I ask and when I ask for help. Now today came for my first unit test, a combination of periods 4 and 5. I studied hours, did practice mcq‚Äôs and saq‚Äôs, did great on the progress checks in AP classroom. I walk into class feeling like I could pass out but sit down and start the test. I get through the mcq part easily and start to type my saq, it was so frickin easy too but I started to hear everyone type and could imagine them going from question to question with no problem and I genuinely had to focus on not vomiting on the table and debating if I needed to literally run to the bathroom and throw up. I have no idea what came over me but I was holding back tears and all of a sudden I couldn‚Äôt spell or write sentences. Before I knew it I got parts A and B of 1/2 saq‚Äôs done and class was almost over. Holy crap I left a whole saq blank. I asked my teacher if I could come in and finish it up and I was sure he‚Äôd say yes as he has ALWAYS let people do that and he said no. I just started silently sobbing. I tried to get something on the page but I was shaking so hard and I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about how I looked so dumb. This was supposed to be my best performance on a test, I always do so good on the writing portions and I just bombed it. \n\nI feel like my life is kind of over. I prepared myself more than ever before and did so much practice over the weekend and the morning of watched the heimler history videos. I‚Äôm sorry if this comes off as ramble-y or if I just sound like I‚Äôm whining but this is the first time I‚Äôve really messed up THIS bad. ",

    "selftext": "I don‚Äôt even know where to start, but I just need to get this off my chest. I‚Äôm currently working in childcare, and honestly, I regret taking this job. I thought it would at least be a little fun, or maybe even fulfilling, but it‚Äôs turned out to be the exact opposite.\n\nThe environment I‚Äôm in is anything but professional. My coworkers and management are, for lack of a better term, lazy and unmotivated. There‚Äôs so much toxicity here, and it feels like people are just out for themselves. If there‚Äôs ever a problem or disagreement, no one tries to sit down and discuss it like adults. Instead, they snap at you like they‚Äôre in some sort of gang.\n\nThis is such a stark contrast to the professional settings I‚Äôve worked in before, where issues came up (because they always do) but were addressed calmly and constructively. Here, it‚Äôs like everyone‚Äôs walking on eggshells, and the second something doesn‚Äôt go someone‚Äôs way, it‚Äôs chaos.\n\nOn top of all that, I‚Äôm a foreigner working in a new country, and honestly, everything feels overwhelming. It‚Äôs already hard enough trying to adapt to a new culture and work environment, but being stuck in this toxic job just makes it so much worse. I feel completely out of place.\n\nWhat makes it even harder is that I‚Äôm scared to open up to my husband and his family about how I‚Äôm feeling. This is my first job in this country, and they‚Äôre all so career-oriented and successful. I feel like they‚Äôll judge me if I tell them how much I‚Äôm struggling. I don‚Äôt want to come off as a crybaby or as someone who can‚Äôt handle things. But the truth is, I feel like I‚Äôm barely holding it together. I‚Äôve been trying so hard to keep my head above water, but it‚Äôs exhausting. I‚Äôve been applying to other jobs for months now, but so far, nothing has come through. I feel completely stuck, and it‚Äôs taking a toll on me in ways I didn‚Äôt expect.\n\nOn top of everything, I‚Äôve already been diagnosed with depression, and this job is only making things worse. I‚Äôm not just mentally drained‚ÄîI‚Äôm physically exhausted as well. It feels like this job is sucking the life out of me, and I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can keep this up. Iguess I‚Äôm just here to vent and maybe find some solidarity. Have any of you been in a similar situation? How did you get through it? I don‚Äôt want to give up entirely, but I‚Äôm starting to feel like that might be my only option.\n\nAny advice or encouragement would mean the world to me right now.",

I imagine myself going to do general things like grocery store, and being challenged by a stranger, ending in me beating them. I feel anxious that my neighbor will do something that will cause me to argue with them, and eventually fight them. \n\nI am constantly imagining scenarios where I am put in situations that force me to fight, or use more aggravated ways of violence. I am extremely fearful of the consequences of my actions, but I know if put in such tight situations, my instinct and impulse will not be to walk away, but to escalate. And that scares me. \n\nI am an ex felon, who did their time 6 years ago. I am still on probation for that, and I'm constantly scared that my freedom will be taken away by something outside of my control. \n\nThe truth is, I don't go out unless it's absolutely necessary. Groceries, reporting to probation, and occasionally going out after being begged enough by my girlfriend. \n\nI do my groceries at the earliest hour they open, wash my clothes at a 24hr laundry and go past midnight. I'm not working right now, but I will have to find work soon. I lived in a place where I owned the property but not the land, I and the rest of the people there were evicted and I'll be forced to find a job soon. My current rent is only paid till April. I dread the thought of being stuck in traffic, dealing with shitty people, it takes a lot of restraint to not want to hurt them. I feel that I'm surrounded by morons who like to test people's patience and I'm afraid of being incarcerated over someone I just couldn't walk away from. But I also don't want to live in constant restraint. \n\nI have a strong desire to leave the city and retire off into a home with land and no neighbors around me, but I'm stuck where I am because of probation and I also need the money for that. I'd like to either find employment as a starting line cook, to eventually move up as I have a passion for cooking and I want a job that challenges me, but I also don't have to deal with customers. Otherwise, a remote job is what I'm looking for. \n\nI know if I find a purpose, a goal to look forward to, and skills to improve upon that these anxious thoughts will go away.

    "selftext": "I've been struggling with anxiety for as long as i can remember. i've had it so long to a point where i can't even fathom what a life without constant anxiety would even look like. throughout different points in my life, my anxiety has manifested in different ways. when i was a kid, i would just get super scared for no good reason and go cry to mom. in my adolescent years, id say up until age 17-18, it was mostly a feeling of impending doom. like everything was out of my control. just constantly overwhelmed even if i didn't have all that much going on. but for the last two years, every anxiety attack turns into me spiraling about my health. at first, it wasn't terrible and didn't happen too often. maybe like once or twice every two weeks. but these last six months, i kid you not, it's been happening AT LEAST 5 days a week. and let me tell you, im so fucking tired of it. \n\ntwo years ago, one of my closest friends that i've had since i was 11 years old got diagnosed with osteosarcoma cancer. for some context, her mother passed away of breast cancer over 10 years ago. before she passed, they learnt she had this gene called the TP53 mutation. if you're unfamiliar with what that is, it's basically a super rare gene that almost always inevitably leads to cancer. they didn't have these kinds of gene tests back in the day, so my friends mom had no way of knowing (until it was too late) that she'd be passing down that horror of a gene by having biological children. my friend beat the cancer in april of 2024 after one hell of a battle including countless surgeries that led her to be in a wheelchair. she was on the road to recovery, learning how to walk again and trying to resume back to her normal life until the cancer returned for a second time in november. same cancer, but way more aggressive. it's too dangerous to operate this time around, so she's been on the chemo pill. they're hoping it shrinks within the next few months so that it at least becomes safe to operate. and don't even get me started on her older sister who's also dealing with the same cancer for the second time as well after she also beat it the first time. it's nothing short of a nightmare of a situation for this family. \n\nanyways, when my friend got diagnosed the first time, i couldn't understand it. although the gene mutation was explanation enough, i still couldn't wrap my head around the fact that this girl who's been nothing but a kind, radiant soul her entire life somehow wound up living a life like this. a life where she's constantly fighting a battle against her own body. i thought, if it could happen to people like her and her sister who are two of the most genuine people i've ever met, why wouldn't it happen to me? even though i constantly remind myself that i don't have that gene or a history of cancer in my family and try to force my brain to understand the fact that the cards they were dealt were just extremely unlucky, i still can't help but spiral with every pain or weird feeling in my body ever since my friend was diagnosed the first time. \n\nfor the past two years, while in the midsts of my panic attacks, i not only feel severely anxious, but also stupidly selfish. i always think, here i am in a healthy body with the luxury of living a normal life and yet i have the nerve to constantly stress over stuff like this, meanwhile my friend who i love so much is the one actually dealing with the shit i'm constantly afraid of. sometimes she'll ask me what's wrong, but i've never been able to tell her the truth. how can i? it would be so silly to say it to her of all people. i don't even know how id feel if i were in her shoes and someone without any health problems told me that shit. i just feel like such a terrible person constantly thinking of the worst when in reality, im perfectly fine and have the luxury of living a normal life when my friend doesn't. my brain just refuses to shut the fuck up. \n\nall that being said, i just want this to stop. i'm sick of constantly thinking im dying every night. im sick of spending my prime years spiraling over little pains that my brain practically gaslights my body into feeling. im sick of feeling this way when my fears are my friend's reality. it's exhausting and selfish of me. \n\nsorry for the long read, i just felt like some context was important to somewhat understand why i constantly feel this way. i'm desperate for a solution. if you have advice, an idea, or literally anything that could even be just potentially helpful, please let me know\n\n",

    "selftext": "\nI guess this is sort of a rant but I‚Äôm also curious if anyone has had or is having an experience similar to me because it just feels so weird.\n\nI (24F) have been dealing with anxiety (GAD) since middle school. My anxiety always has been triggered by big changes, so transitioning from middle to high school was a huge challenge and then high school to college was also rough, but I made it through. Each time, I just needed some time to get used to the new situation and eventually I was fine. After the initial transition period, I could go months or even years without feeling a single ounce of anxiety. I‚Äôve grown a lot and learned a lot about my anxiety since I was younger, some things have changed, but that was something that always stayed constant: after the transition period, after I got comfortable where I was, whether at a new school or new job, the anxiety eventually subsided. \n\nNot this time. This time it‚Äôs weird (compared to what I‚Äôve experienced in the past with my anxiety) and I‚Äôm so frustrated and confused. Basically, I started a new job at the end of August last year. I had a little bit of anxiety during the transition (to be expected). But it was actually a lot better than it had been in the past. September comes and goes and I‚Äôm doing pretty well, getting used to the new job. Then October hits and things change. I‚Äôm not sure if it was my medication or what (I was seeing a psychiatrist that was not great who I have since stopped seeing, I think maybe she changed something but I honestly don‚Äôt even remember). During transition periods/periods of high anxiety, my anxiety is often worse in the mornings. This isn‚Äôt new. What was new that mainly started in October was that I started throwing up in the mornings (never happened before) and waking up shaking with my heart racing. The shaking and heard racing would happen during periods of high anxiety in the past, but never did I just wake up like that. What is so weird to me is it‚Äôs not like I woke up and started overthinking and getting in my head and THEN got anxious. I literally wake up anxious. It‚Äôs like I wake up and my body is in fight or flight mode. Shaking, heart racing, throwing up. FOR NO REASON!!! That‚Äôs the thing! I literally love my new job, I finally feel like I‚Äôm in a great place, I‚Äôm getting married this year, we‚Äôre moving in together soon‚Ä¶and yes I know what you‚Äôre thinking, that‚Äôs a lot of big life changes, that could be causing some of the anxiety. And yes, maybe a little bit. But that‚Äôs normal big life changes anxiety. Not waking up in the morning throwing up anxiety. Is it? Either way, here‚Äôs where it gets weirder‚Ä¶this only happens on days that I go to work. Weekends I‚Äôm completely fine. Sometimes Sunday nights I get a little uneasy because I anticipate that morning anxiety, but like Monday we had off and I was totally fine. Reminder: I really like my job!!! Plus, the majority of the day I‚Äôm fine! It‚Äôs literally only from the moment I wake up to when I walk in the building at work. Then it goes away and I enjoy my day. WTF???\n\nGod I‚Äôm SO frustrated. Throughout all of this and throughout my life, I have seen many therapists, psychiatrists, psychologists, etc. I am seeing a therapist now who I‚Äôve been with for a while, she‚Äôs amazing and she has been giving me a lot of good strategies to help me get through the mornings. I am also seeing a new psychiatrist and am currently working on a list of all of the medications I‚Äôve taken in the past and trying to remember what helped and what didn‚Äôt to help give her some more information. Some of the meds I‚Äôve tried in the past are bupropion (wellbutrin), gabapentin (neurontin), aripiprazole (abilify), lamotrigine (lamictal), desvenlafaxine (pristiq), clonazepam (klonipin), sertraline (zoloft), propranolol (inderal), busprione (burpar)‚Ä¶to name a few lol (that‚Äôs literally all of them). I‚Äôm currently on duloxetine (cymbalta) and have been on it for years, but the new doc suggested I try to come off of it and try escitalopram (lexapro) instead. I think I was on lexapro many many years ago but I honestly don‚Äôt remember so we‚Äôre going to give it a shot. Most recently, I also tried prazosin (minipress) but it had no effect. \n\nThank you if you read all this. Again, I‚Äôm mainly ranting bc I‚Äôm so frustrated and I feel like my brain/body is making miserable for no reason, but I am curious if anyone has experienced anything like this before, if you got past it and how.\n",

    "selftext": "Diagnosed with panic disorder\n\nBackstory: So I've been struggling a lot the past months, I couldn't go to school or even to the store for a while. It's better now, but still bad. I can go out but school is really really hard, and I always have bad anxiety before going outside.\n\nI've been struggling really bad with anticipatory anxiety, and many times that is what causes panic attacks. Before meetings with teachers or my therapist, I always feel like I'm gonna faint and I walk in circles from the moment I wake up until the meeting/event (even though I always do them online). Sometimes for days I feel like this, except for the few moments when I forget. The problem is that now I feel this way before doing the smallest things. I will use gaming as an example, because I game a lot. When I'm in the moment where I have to focus or do something that is 1v1 I get the same bad anxiety, and that's for such a small thing. Sometimes I get that feeling just by going to the kitchen if one of my family members are there. I guess I've always had anticipatory anxiety when I think about it, and that's the reason I've been having panic attacks before I realised that they were panic attacks (I only realised when they got so bad I ended up laying on a random buss stop crying and trying to breath, almost fainting). But I've always been a really open and social/curious person so I don't really know how that makes sense. Because of that I also feel like I've lost a part of myself. I just really want to be able to do the things I love, but I can't. How do I stop this? I'm nervous about absolutely EVERYTHING and I never try to avoid things because I know that will make it worse, but it still doesn't get better.",

You know the type‚Äîthe ones who say, ‚ÄúJust go for a walk,‚Äù ‚ÄúJust breathe,‚Äù or the classic: ‚ÄúPull yourself up by your bootstraps.‚Äù\n\nIf it were that simple, don‚Äôt you think I would‚Äôve done it already? If I could magically cure my anxiety, depression, or trauma with a brisk jog or some yoga, I wouldn‚Äôt need therapy, medication, or years of unlearning the damage caused by abuse.\n\nTrauma doesn‚Äôt just go away. It fundamentally changes you. I‚Äôm realizing more and more how deep the physiological impact of trauma really is. Complex PTSD isn‚Äôt just about ‚Äúbad memories‚Äù or ‚Äúfeeling sad.‚Äù It rewires your nervous system, changes how your brain processes stress, affects your body on a hormonal level, and impacts everything from sleep to digestion to emotional regulation. This isn‚Äôt just a mindset problem‚Äîit‚Äôs a full-body experience, and the idea that I should just think my way out of it is beyond insulting.\n\nAnd what‚Äôs worse? The condescension. The implication that I‚Äôm somehow choosing this, that I‚Äôm weak, lazy, or just ‚Äúdwelling‚Äù on things. No, I‚Äôm not ‚Äústuck in the past.‚Äù The past is stuck in me. When you‚Äôve lived through years of abuse, your brain doesn‚Äôt just snap back like a rubber band the moment you decide to ‚Äúmove on.‚Äù Healing isn‚Äôt linear. It‚Äôs complicated, exhausting, and requires real work‚Äînot just wishful thinking.\n\nWhat makes it even worse is when the people who were supposed to protect you, love you, and be there for you were the ones who hurt you the most. When you grow up in emotional neglect or outright abuse, you don‚Äôt just get over that. How do you just ‚Äúmove on‚Äù from never feeling safe, from never having support, from having to parent yourself while the people around you acted like your suffering didn‚Äôt exist?\n\nSome of us never had a safety net. We never had a support system. We never had people to turn to when things got bad. And then, on top of that, we‚Äôre expected to function like everyone else, as if all of that didn‚Äôt permanently alter our ability to trust, to connect, to feel okay in our own skin.\n\nI‚Äôm tired of the oversimplification of mental health. I‚Äôm tired of people who have no idea what it‚Äôs like to live with CPTSD acting like they have all the answers. And I‚Äôm really tired of being made to feel like my struggles are my fault.\n\nFor those of you who deal with this, how do you respond? How do you handle people who refuse to understand the complexity of trauma and mental health? Because right now, I am struggling to stay patient.\n\nThanks for letting me vent.

Maybe I misunderstood her, but it seemed to me like she was suggesting that everyone has problems and I could get some basic help but she doesn‚Äôt think I need anything else for the time being. I really connected with her the first time so I felt that there was a disconnect between how I feel and how I come off. She said it didn‚Äôt seem like my mental health was impacting my life and work. I was told that it might seem like a crises to me (but it‚Äôs not compared to other people). \n\nI‚Äôm not really sure what to make of my experience with this situation. I feel demoralized and invalidated in my experience. At the same time, I‚Äôm trying to understand her response and reassess my ‚Äúrealities‚Äù. \n\nLooking for some support. Advice is very welcome.

I couldn‚Äôt get it to go away, and a little difficulty breathing but I‚Äôve dealt with it before so I wasn‚Äôt so worried. I felt very off though (cold tired) so I checked my blood pressure.

I am normally a very reserved person and don‚Äôt speak up much but at that moment I was begging the EMS to make the pain stop.

    "selftext": "Hey there! The past three years have been really tough for me. Starting in September 2021 (I was 23), I had a panic attacks every day, and I started therapy, which helped a bit. But soon after, I began having obsessive thoughts about harming others or myself. I thought this might be a sign of schizophrenia, so I went to see a psychiatrist - actually, three different specialists to get varying opinions. They all said I had anxiety disorder with obsessive thoughts. I‚Äôm still working with a psychologist, and it‚Äôs been a bit of a rollercoaster. Some days are better, some are worse. I'm still thinking that my obsessive thoughts are the symptom of schizophrenia. On top of that, the war started in my country, and in the past few years, I‚Äôve moved through five cities, two countries, and just a month ago, I moved to Toronto with my boyfriend, leaving my old life behind. We decided to adopt a kitten (I‚Äôve never had a pet before), and we brought her home five days ago. I‚Äôve been so anxious about potentially having those horrible obsessive thoughts again, especially about possibly causing harm to this little creature, that I ended up having a panic attack.\n\nShe‚Äôs so small and innocent, and every time she meows or seems scared, I feel like a terrible person. I worry that I can‚Äôt be a good cat owner, or that I should be happier than I am in this moment. She is perfect, beautiful and very smart cat. But adopting her wasn‚Äôt a random decision - I‚Äôve dreamed of having a cat my whole life. I loved visiting friends with cats and even looked after them when they were on vacation. I have no issue with feeding her, cleaning the litter box, taking her to the vet - it's more about the emotional side of having a little animal who depends on me, and knowing I need to dedicate time to making her happy. So, I guess I‚Äôm just wondering what‚Äôs happening with me, and whether I‚Äôm a bad or a person with a serious mental disease because of these thoughts. Thank you so much for reading this, and sorry for the long message!\n\nPlease tell me that I'm not going crazy!:(",

    "selftext": "Please, If you have any idea of why this is happening or if you have a suggestion that might help me, please, do.\n\nIt's hard to say with precision when this problem started. Officially, the first time I felt this way was about 5 years ago, but my psychologist believes it has been a problem for longer than that ‚Äî and that most likely, I reached my limit and started to feel the problem as intensely as possible, all that was missing was a trigger.\n\nWhen I was 14 years old, I dated a girl during the pandemic. We didn't usually meet due to the circumstances and because of that, a part of our relationship was long distance. 3 months had gone by until we finally had the opportunity to see each other, I invited her to eat a burger at a relative's house and everything went well until the moment we sat down to eat. Everyone was sitting at the table and she was sitting next to me, I prepared my burger beforehand just the way I liked it to be done and I took the first bite. The feeling was immediate. I felt nauseous and dizzy, my body started to sweat and I felt that chill from when you lose something or someone important to you, it felt a lot like an anxiety attack, but it was much stronger. The last symptom was the urge to vomit, and I couldn't bear it. I ran to the bathroom and tried to calm myself down, and it was working until my girlfriend decided to check on me. As soon as she showed concern, it all came back. The situation was desperate. I was trying to relax, but her presence made it all come back and I had no idea what was happening. I think that I convinced her to leave me alone at that moment and I finally got to recover. The rest of the day felt like a blur, I felt exhausted and extremely weak without doing anything. I have never experienced anything like that in my entire life.\n\nAfter that day, every time my girlfriend or someone from my daily life showed affection towards me, I felt the same way I felt that day. It was bearable in some way, but it turned out to be unbearable when someone tried to touch me. Any slight attempt to touch me felt like torture. When it happened, I felt paralyzed. I couldn't move a muscle, I was petrified with discomfort and I struggled to control my thoughts. Everything I mentioned, as I said, was tolerable, the worst part was the urge to puke. Both times it occured, I was in a relationship and those were the worst days of my life. All it takes is words of affection or an attempt to touch me and I get triggered, my body responds instantly. Even when I'm distracted and free of worries, my body responds the same way. Vomiting has always been the \"highest stage\" of this reaction, and it is the moment I completely lose control of my mind and mind. I always think I'm going to die and it's exhausting to live like this. Within the relationship, I was never able to be alone with her again, always scared by the thought of being touched and feeling sick because of it. The only moment I felt safe around her, was when we were surrounded by other people. I was sure she wouldn't touch me without permission or in a more \"direct way\".\n\nIt is important to make it clear that she was NEVER invasive and that she always RESPECTED my boundaries, these thoughts only went thought my head as a way of trying to explain what was happening to me. We broke up later and remained as friends. The interesting part is that the issue suddenly disappeared, just like magic. Of course, sometimes I felt sick because I wasn't completely free of it, but it wasn't nearly as intense as before.\n\nOver the years, I learned to live with it. I avoided hugs, always said \"I love you\" before the person had the opportunity to say it first, ran away from family gatherings and adopted the image of a cold person to protect myself from any display of love and affection. It was tolerable for some time. Just like a virus, the issue began to \"mutate\" and affect even more areas of my life as the months gone by. Sometimes I had to stop talking to my friends and ask them for some time alone, because I couldn't stand the discomfort and the sickness. I could only stand the feeling when I was with my friend group and strangers, what was really bad was when my family and love interests were affectionately towards me. It was simply unbearable. I went to 4 psychologists before finding my current one, none of them paying attention to this dilemma. I went to my current psychologist only with the intention of resolving this issue, because it was staring to become difficult to live with such a problem. I made a lot of progress and I started to notice a few things. Whenever I felt bad, I was close to food. The first time it happened, I was eating, and every occurrence after that: I was eating, had just eaten, or was near food. If someone says something affectionate while I'm eating, I feel sick. It doesn't necessarily have to be an \"I love you\" or \"you're beautiful\", but what I understand as affection, which even involves jokes to make me laugh. As I said before, all of this is tolerable when it doesn't get out of hand, but when it affects my life to the point I can barely eat without feeling sick, it has become an urgency.\n\nA long time ago, I changed several habits of mine because if it, such as having lunch with my family, being touched by my girlfriend when I'm eating, having snacks with friends and, most recently, I started to skip lunch. Somehow, the issue ended up affecting even things that don't directly envolve affection or being touched. Just the thought of lunch being an activity known for bringing a family together is enough to make me feel sick. Any conception and construction I have about what love is, and how it can be expressed, is enough to mess up my life. With some people, it's even harder to control, especially because of the proximity we share, but mainly because of the trust issues. The first thought that comes to my mind is: \"if I ask this person to stop, will they respect my decision?\". I built a hierarchy of trust in my head, from the most complicated to the simplest to deal with: love interests, family, friends and strangers. The funny thing is, how come my mind thinks a stranger is more trustworthy than a partner?\n\nBecause of this idea, my psychologist suggested that I might have suffered some kind of abuse during childhood. Not necessarily sexual violence, but a \"simple\" psychological abuse while I was eating, which expands the range of hypotheses. For example, I may have heard someone swearing at me during lunch and it created a trauma. The bif issue is that I don't remember basically anything from my childhood, not even my traumas. These days, I've been having some trouble swallowing pills and dealing with strong emotions, always around food. I don't know what to do or what to think about it anymore, I just want to be free from this issue and go back to living normally.",

Is this normal or common? Like I just prefer not paying any attention to my breathing. Doing diaphragmic breathing where I breathe more with my stomach does help a bit but it's still not great. I've had all sorts of physical tests done so I know I don't have asthma or anything else. Have I perhaps just accumulated too much tension or am too burnt out for it to work for me immediately? Is it something I need to keep doing for a while before I see the effects? If anyone has the same issue, are there alternatives that work better for you? Thanks!",

    "title": "Breast cancer anxiety",
    "selftext": "Sorry, this is a long post. I don't want to look at another Google page, so this is me looking for comfort.\n\nWell, I (F43) guess I suffered from health anxiety from a very young age, but it's been okay for a really long time (even my family didn't notice).  Recently it's been getting really bad though. I was convinced I had a brain tumor or early onset Alzheimer's for almost a year, because my memory would be really bad at times. I still was functioning on a high cognitive level at work though and managed my household with 2 kids. So, I finally got an MRI a few months ago and that ruled out the tumor. I finally am getting over the fear of these horrible disease, even the Alzheimer's that isn't detectable in it's early form. \n\nI have been practicing DARE and it's techniques really help me. I also noticed my cycle has a huge influence and my hypothesis is that I'm in my perimenopause, which would also explain the memory lapses. As well as the fear!\n\nMy new thing is a pain I started having in my right breast. It lasted for a week or two and would sting. I was becoming more worried over time, but also told myself it was probably also hormones so wait till your period start. Well, my period started and the pain was gone. But I noticed there was a lump in the center of my breast, just below where the pain would be before. This lump feels large and long (not round, more like an oval disc) and I can feel it best when I lift my arm. \n\nBecause of the memory issues I got B12 injections and I had to make a doctor's appointment to order new. I figured I would get a look at the lump, while I'm there and I told myself to not worry any longer if the doc told me it was fine. The anxiety was pretty manageable until the appointment, because I told myself I would take the reassurance if it was offered. So far, so good.\n\nThe doctor felt the lump but called it small (I feel like I feel it a lot better and it feels really big, but I wasn't putting my arm up while he felt it, stupid I know). And because I have no more symptoms like leakage or dents, and no family history of breast cancer, he wasn't worried. He told me that if it doesn't grow and there are no other symptoms, I don't have to come back for it. His guess was it was hormones related.\n\nWell, I woke up the next morning (yesterday) in total anxiety mode. I took a shower and felt like the lump was twice it's size, but I realized it was just the same as yesterday. Because I felt like I had to fix this fear right away, I emailed my doctor telling him I would like to get a referral to the hospital for a proper exam anyway (they make an ultrasound or mammography at the hospital, but I need a referral). He hasn't responded (will probably do so tomorrow because they try in 2 days) and I've been checking my phone over and over again today, fearing he might deny me the exam. I was totally obsessed. I have a wonderful doctor who listens really good, so I don't know why he would do so, but still..\n\nTo top it off I looked up the waiting times for hospitals today and they are up to 16 days. That's way too long, so now I have anxiety over the amount of anxiety I'm going to have for the coming weeks, even if my doc says yes. Everywhere I read (I know google is hell, but I can't help myself) it says breast cancer grows really fast. So 16 days feels like it could make it all so bad it can't be treated anymore.\n\nHealth anxiety really sucks! The problem with health anxiety for me is that I live in a country where the GP doesn't order exams or check ups easily, and I need proper reassurance from such a check, before I can get to the 'acceptance of fear' fase. All programs start with 'if you have been properly looked at by a medical professional, you know you don't really have this issue you fear.' But what if you feel like you are not properly looked at?\n\nI guess I will have to accept the fact that I might die from some disease that could have been detected earlier or could have been treatable. If I'm at that stage I'm finally at the End Boss Level of kicking my anxiety to the curb. \n\nCan anyone relate? Any guidance?",

    "title": "Beta blockers that don't cause hair loss?",
    "selftext": "I have Propranolol. It works good for anxiety. But it makes me lose my hair. Do you know any calming beta blockers that are less likely to cause hair loss?  \n\n\nEdit: I asked ChatGPT about it, here is the answer if anyone else is wondering about the question:\n\n\"Some beta-blockers have a lower risk of causing hair loss compared to others. Hair loss is a possible side effect of beta-blockers, but it is not very common. If you are concerned about hair loss, it may be worth discussing with your doctor the possibility of switching to a beta-blocker that has fewer reports of this side effect. Here are some options:\n\n# 1. Beta-blockers with a lower risk of hair loss:\n\n* **Nebivolol (e.g., Bystolic):** Nebivolol is a selective beta-blocker that may have milder side effects compared to non-selective beta-blockers like propranolol. It is often used for high blood pressure and has been reported to cause less hair loss.\n* **Atenolol:** Atenolol is another selective beta-blocker that may have a lower risk of hair-related side effects than some others.\n* **Bisoprolol:** Bisoprolol is also selective and could be an option if hair loss is a concern.\n\n# 2. Beta-blockers with a higher risk of hair loss:\n\n* **Propranolol:** Propranolol is a non-selective beta-blocker and is more commonly associated with hair loss as a side effect.\n* **Metoprolol:** Although metoprolol is selective, some people have reported hair loss as a side effect.\n\n# Why can beta-blockers cause hair loss?\n\nHair loss can occur because beta-blockers may affect the growth cycle of hair follicles, causing more follicles to enter the resting phase (telogen effluvium). This leads to temporary hair shedding rather than permanent loss.\n\n\\>Are those as calming as Propranolol?\n\nIt depends on the effect you are looking for, as different beta-blockers have slightly different profiles in how they work on the body. Here is a comparison of the calming properties of the beta-blockers we mentioned:\n\n# 1. Propranolol ‚Äì The Most Calming\n\n* **Mechanism of action**: Propranolol is a **non-selective beta-blocker**, meaning it affects both beta-1 (heart) and beta-2 (lungs, blood vessels) receptors.\n* **Calming effect**: Propranolol is often used to manage anxiety, especially performance anxiety, as it blocks the physical symptoms of stress (e.g., heart palpitations, tremors, and sweating).\n* **Note**: It also crosses the blood-brain barrier, which contributes to its calming effect.\n\n# 2. Nebivolol ‚Äì Less Calming\n\n* **Mechanism of action**: Nebivolol is a **selective beta-1 blocker**, meaning it primarily works on the heart and has minimal effects on beta-2 receptors.\n* **Calming effect**: It is generally milder and less sedating than propranolol because it doesn‚Äôt affect the nervous system in the same way. However, it can help reduce physical symptoms of anxiety, though perhaps not as effectively as propranolol.\n\n# 3. Atenolol ‚Äì Less Calming\n\n* **Mechanism of action**: Atenolol is also a **selective beta-1 blocker**.\n* **Calming effect**: Atenolol has a weaker effect on the nervous system and does not cross the blood-brain barrier as easily as propranolol. This makes it less effective for managing anxiety-related symptoms.\n\n# 4. Bisoprolol ‚Äì Similar to Nebivolol and Atenolol\n\n* **Mechanism of action**: Bisoprolol is also a **selective beta-1 blocker**.\n* **Calming effect**: Its effect on anxiety is mild, similar to Nebivolol and Atenolol. It is effective at lowering heart rate but less ‚Äúcalming‚Äù in terms of affecting the central nervous system.\n\n# Summary: How Calming Are They in Comparison?\n\n* **Propranolol**: The most calming and the best choice for managing anxiety-related symptoms.\n* **Nebivolol, Atenolol, Bisoprolol**: Less calming and primarily effective for heart-related symptoms (e.g., high blood pressure or palpitations) but less noticeable for anxiety.\n\n\"",

She then messaged me asking how I was doing. I said I had anxiety and was unpacking a lot in therapy. She then asked if I knew the root of my anxiety, which she figured out for herself. I said I had critical parents but also had life events and how that person blowing up made it worse recently, but I had recovered from the blow up. She then asked why that person blew up on me. I told her and started feeling not okay from all my anxiety source talk. \n\nHer: Ooooo.\n\nHer: I'll say more after I get out of work.\n\nMe: I'm not able to talk about it a lot btw.\n\nThen she sent 4 messages after 10PM. I haven't looked at it, especially because I've stepped away from Facebook this week and announced (and had given a heads up post about it) on there I was logging in just for events. But the messages preview showed \"Sounds like drama for drama's sake. Best n...\"\n\nY'all get people nosey or trying to be your therapist? I need to find a way to say to people \"I have anxiety and am working on it. That's how I'm doing, but that's not an invite to discuss it or be my therapist, which I already have and am working with.\"\n\n\nEdit: Fixed some missing words.",

    "selftext": "I‚Äôve struggled with anxiety and depression for years, and despite going to therapy for a long time and making significant changes in my life, I‚Äôve always felt down for no apparent reason. Even when things were going well, I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling of being stuck. I‚Äôm also naturally very anxious about almost everything, my roommate tells me sometimes I am sort of like a Chihuahua lol, also my ex told me this.\n\nAbout a month ago, while I was in Vietnam, I started experiencing panic attacks, last time I got them was about 10 years ago. I went to see a psychiatrist in Hanoi, who prescribed me Clonazepam and Lexapro (and a few other things). At the time, I didn‚Äôt question it since I was in the middle of a panic episode and needed something to manage it, especially since I had a 12-hour flight back to the EU which was impossible without meds.\n\nI had been considering seeing a psychiatrist for a few years now because I‚Äôd run out of ideas on how to improve my mental well-being and tended to auto-medicate with Alcohol which is terrible. In hindsight, those panic attacks turned out to be a blessing in disguise. After just three weeks on medication, I feel like a version of myself I didn‚Äôt know existed. I‚Äôm accomplishing things that would normally take me months: I enrolled in a German course (even though I‚Äôve lived here for a while and only know the basics), earned a tech certification in just a week, and I wake up with real motivation to get work done. The motivation for the gym has dropped a little, but I‚Äôm still going.\n\nThat said, I stumbled upon this subreddit today and started to feel a bit anxious about the medication. I wondered if this treatment would eventually normalize my brain to the point where I could stop taking meds. Some people seem to stay on them for years, and I was concerned after reading about withdrawal experiences. But after reflecting on how much better I‚Äôve been feeling these past three weeks, I‚Äôm choosing to focus on the positives. I‚Äôll continue with my treatment, and once I find a new doctor, I plan to discuss my options further. As of now it has been life changing honestly.",

    "selftext": "So I‚Äôve realized something about myself, I don‚Äôt know how to function when things are stable because I‚Äôve always had an unstable childhood. My mom being a sociopath, dad passing away, sister passing away from suicide. I‚Äôve grown up constantly anticipating the next disaster, always staying one step ahead to avoid pain, and now that my life is actually stable, my brain is losing it.\n\nI have a remote job, I live alone, and everything should feel fine. But instead of enjoying it, I feel like I‚Äôm self-sabotaging. I keep messing up at work every week, and deep down, I think it‚Äôs because my brain expects something bad to happen. It‚Äôs waiting for the other shoe to drop, so it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm unconsciously making it drop first.\n\nIt‚Äôs like this everything, a job, relationship, and thing. For example, with job, I‚Äôve been constantly refreshing LinkedIn, deactivated it, then reactivated it, then deactivated again, because my brain is telling me to start looking for a new job now just in case I get laid off. Even though there‚Äôs no real sign that I will, my mind just won‚Äôt shut up about it. It‚Äôs like I can‚Äôt sit still because if I‚Äôm not preparing for disaster, I feel unsafe. The same was with my past relationship, like I already prepared myself that this wouldn‚Äôt last just by looking at the signs so I can just be one step ahead every time. \n\nI don‚Äôt even enjoy what I‚Äôve accomplished because I‚Äôm already thinking about what‚Äôs next, how to stay ahead, how to make sure I never have to deal with inconveniences. Like, instead of just feeling okay in my job, I‚Äôm obsessing over what if I get laid off? and trying to control a future that hasn‚Äôt even happened.\n\nHas anyone else felt this? How do you actually learn to trust stability when your brain has only ever known chaos? How do you stop yourself from constantly needing to be one step ahead? Because I feel like I‚Äôm ruining my own peace without even meaning to.",

    "title": "Systemic disregard of anxiety conditions by legal agencies",
    "selftext": "I‚Äôve struggled with OCD, anxiety, depression, and knee injuries requiring multiple surgeries since childhood. After a college knee injury and surgery, my mental health worsened, and my OCD became unbearable. I graduated in 2016, worked briefly as a teacher, but left due to worsening symptoms. In 2017, I was accepted into grad school but postponed enrollment to care for my father, who passed away from cancer later that year. Despite worsening knee pain, I delayed treatment to prioritize his care. After his passing, I had my third surgery in December 2017. During recovery, a severe bike accident during physical therapy led to a fourth surgery, disrupting my plans for grad school. That summer, I was bedridden and in the worst sustained pain of my life. I informed the University about the surgery, told them I would arrive late, and asked for help catching up, but received no response. For two months, I was on crutches, wearing a brace, and struggled with moving to a new apartment and school in a new state. Knee pain and instability persisted, leaving me increasingly behind.\"\n\nMy OCD and depression became unbearable every time I tried to study. Grad school coursework builds on concepts from the last years of college, but those years were extremely traumatic for me. Studying turned into reliving past trauma, leaving me depressed and exhausted. I sought help from the University mental health center, but they only offered one 30-minute therapy session per month, which wasn‚Äôt enough. I also tried connecting with other grad students to work in groups, as group work helps ease my OCD symptoms, but those efforts were unsuccessful.\n\n\"I registered with the campus disability center and requested accommodations for extra time on assignments, but my request was ignored, and I was dismissed from the program. I appealed, providing medical records of my surgeries, mental health struggles, frequent illnesses likely caused by medication prescribed by a university doctor, and records of hospital visits, physical therapy, and orthopedic consultations for ongoing knee issues. Despite this, my appeal was denied, likely because a professor falsely claimed I had never submitted any assignments.\n\nI returned home in mid-2019 broken and inconsolable. Feeling mistreated, I spent months trying to make sense of my removal and compose a complaint, but my OCD made the process excruciating. Revisiting the events triggered extreme depression, leaving me unable to function. The process drove me to suicidal thoughts, forcing me to take it slowly. Eventually, after several months, I completed the complaint and filed it with the Office for Civil Rights.\n\n**Filing with OCR**  \nI filed a complaint with OCR, explaining that my five-month delay was due to disability-related reasons. I provided detailed documentation of my medical conditions, surgeries, and mental health struggles, along with expert testimony on the incapacitating effects of my OCD. According to OCR‚Äôs manual, exceptions for lateness are allowed in such cases, but despite waiting two years, they rejected my case as ‚Äútoo late.‚Äù They refused to explain why they ignored the exception and offered no further justification, mirroring the same disregard shown by my university.\n\n**Turning to the U.S. Attorney‚Äôs Office**  \nFollowing advice from a disability advocacy group, I filed a complaint with the U.S. Attorney‚Äôs Office. They claimed their denial was unrelated to the lateness or complexity of my case but refused to provide a specific reason, citing resource limitations. I suggested narrowing my case and using existing documentation to reduce their workload, but they still declined. They never asked how my condition impacted my academic performance or the timeliness of my actions, making their response feel like systemic disregard rather than a genuine resource issue.\n\n**What I Need Help With**  \nI feel systematically dismissed by these institutions, which seem to use pretexts to avoid taking my case. I suspect they don‚Äôt view my conditions as true disabilities, which in itself is a form of discrimination. With significant prosecutorial discretion, these agencies can decide which complaints to pursue, and their decisions are nearly impossible to challenge.\n\nI‚Äôve also reached out to my Congressman and Senators‚Äô offices for advocacy, but they seem to lack understanding or interest, leaving me with no progress. Has anyone had positive outcomes engaging with lawmakers in cases like this?\n\nI‚Äôm seeking advice on:\n\n1. **Disability discrimination cases** ‚Äì Is this pattern of rejection common, and how can I hold these institutions accountable?\n2. **Advocacy efforts** ‚Äì How can I better advocate for myself or find someone to champion my case?\n3. **Systemic issues** ‚Äì Are there organizations tackling systemic disregard for disabilities in education and legal systems?\n\nAny guidance would mean a lot. I‚Äôm at a loss for how to ensure my disabilities are taken seriously.  \nThank you for your support.",

    "title": "I have a strange relationship with Xanax",
    "selftext": "I'm in a remote part of Africa right now, and I got some Xanax over-the-counter to take for my anxiety. It‚Äôs easily available from pharmacies without a prescription. I've been having issues sleeping, and when I do get some sleep, usually just a few hours, when I wake up I start to panic. And so, I thought this medication could potentially help me out, even though I have never taken it. I'm also a little hesitant to take it because I don't know how I would react to it, and if I were to have an adverse reaction, or God forbid, some type of medical emergency, I would not get proper care here even though it's a very low dosage, and there's very little chance of anything major happening to me. \n\nEither way, I keep it with me at all times just in case my symptoms become unmanageable. I've become really emotionally reliant on having access to this medication though. So anytime I go somewhere, especially if I'm going out to the town, or going places where I'm not very familiar with, I take it with me just as a backup because I have experienced a little bit of panicky feelings when I go outside. I noticed that when I lose the medication or misplace it, I literally start to freak out. My legs start to shake, and I get the gut-punching feelings in my stomach. Once I find the medication, the symptoms resolve. Again, I haven‚Äôt taken it so there‚Äôs no mental reference point for me to say it‚Äôs actually helpful but I guess I get comfort from knowing that I have a powerful option should I need it. I have not reached the threshold yet because I‚Äôve been able to manage my anxiety through sleep, breathing techniques and exercise. \n\nLong story short, I‚Äôve become emotionally dependent on having Xanax with me (panicking whenever I can‚Äôt find it) even though I‚Äôve never taken it. It brings me comfort knowing I have a safety net if my symptoms become unmanageable. It‚Äôs strange, I know, but it just shows that I probably have a lot of underlying anxiety issues that aren‚Äôt just about the Xanax itself. ",

Anyways before all this started I was a gym rat, started my journey because I was fat and wanted to become more fit to honestly impress a girl but ended up falling in love with health and fitness. Anyways then came the health anxiety and stopped completely, lost all my progress and got even fatter from 1 year and gain 30 pounds and lost my muscle. Anyways I‚Äôve been trying to get back in it but now exercise does not feel the same I get short of breath but like 5x more and I‚Äôm constantly on edge. Every time I would leave the gym I would feel worse then how I felt when I went in. Honestly that discouraged me so much I stopped going again and well here I am trying to go back and going to try to stop caring how I feel or what I feel because I‚Äôm causing more harm getting fatter then going to the gym.

I‚Äôve been on my own for about 2 years now and have started going to the doctor for the first time in 7 years. I decided to go to a psychiatrist because of some issues I just can‚Äôt take anymore. I was diagnosed with OCD which kinda confused me as I don‚Äôt know too much about it. I haven‚Äôt been able to get more than 3-6 hours of sleep for two years. My brain won‚Äôt shut off and I have racing thoughts about things I need to get done that are stressing me out or scenarios that could happen, concerns about my brother and his family, concerns about my future, my dog, past experiences that I read into and wonder what they‚Äôre emotions towards me we‚Äôre. I am so tired but just can‚Äôt sleep. I‚Äôve tried lots of things except prescription meds because I wanted to get the source. It‚Äôs takes me about 3 days of no sleep for me to randomly be sitting on the couch or in a chair and I‚Äôll wake up to my Partner saying \"you were asleep like that for 3 hours\". If I clean for long hours, basically exhausting myself, I‚Äôm able to lay down and sleep for about 6 hours but I wake up on the hour with my heart beating like I‚Äôm anxious. I feel like most the time I have no personality or purpose and nothing brings me joy. Then I randomly get these bursts of energy like I can‚Äôt sit still have to clean or run and there a million thoughts going through my head and I feel like I could be some big shot CEO and build a house üòÇ something my partner pointing out was that if someone says something or something happens that give some even the slightest negative emotion I just spiral and start thinking about how hopeless I am. I am so mentally exhausted and the only thing that keeps me going is that I have to be here for my partner and my pup dog. I repeat to myself that I just need to bite my tongue and wait this out until I have burst of energy and happiness again. I am also very organized. Not in the head, that‚Äôs all over the place üòÇüòÖ but my room is spotless and precise and I can‚Äôt live without my multiple notebooks that I write lists for everything in/journaling. I‚Äôll write a list of things to do when I‚Äôm hyper and then feel so overwhelmed and unmotivated after that hyper feeling goes away. I‚Äôm only a little bothered with germs, I don‚Äôt let my partner kiss the top of my hand, touch my face, or I‚Äôll clean his cup really well so there‚Äôs no germs on it. I‚Äôm just worried that he might get sick. I definitely get really anxious over talking to people but as soon as I do I become this charismatic person that knows how to ask the right questions and keep the person talking about themselves to make them like me even though I find talking to people kind of unbearable:/ I apologize that this is so long and I appreciate anyone who reads this or even makes it this far. I‚Äôm also Sorry it‚Äôs all over the place üòÖ This is my first time being diagnosed with anything/seeking help. My family never hugs or says I love you so talking about emotions feels wrong and I‚Äôm nervous about this whole process.

I haven't been in four years. I have spent those years obsessing over any sensation in my teeth, searching the Internet, talking to people about dentists, and guilt-tripping myself and shaming myself and desperately trying to force myself to go.\n\nI give up. Pre-gap, I canceled appointments before because I was throwing up in the car midway through a panic attack. I spent an entire vacation obsessing over the location of dentist's offices. I've done DIY exposure therapy multiple times. I had the world's greatest dentist - still nothing. No trust, no tolerance. Not only did I leave the office sobbing hysterically, but I sprinted half a mile away in full fight-or-flight mode.\n\nThis entire time I've been trying to live up to my own (and my parents') standards. Just go to the dentist. Just go to the dentist. Stop being such a baby, grow up and go to the dentist. Everyone does it. Get over it. Get over yourself.\n\nYeah, well, I give up. I found a new dentist with amazing reviews who does sedation dentistry for anxious patients. Next time I sit in the dental chair to get work done, I am doing it with an IV in my arm. I am going to make an appointment for an exam, see what I need, and then ask the dentist to schedule a time to knock me out and get it done. No more lying in the chair trembling violently, too afraid to speak, dissociating so heavily I am watching myself from above. No more crying myself to sleep, no more sleepless nights. What am I even trying to prove? Why is it so important to me that I can overcome my fear of the dentist? What, am I supposed to be a better person because I can sit through a root canal?\n\nNo. Screw that. Knock me the f\\*ck out and spare me the suffering. Dental phobia, you win this round, but you don't get to mess with the rest of my life.

Don't get me wrong, I love being married and I absolutely adore my husband, he's great! But I've always been a homebody and lived with my parents until I got married. I was totally fine up until our first day in the apartment after our honeymoon. I literally had a mental breakdown for about 6 months. I couldn't be near crowds, would barely leave my house, cried all the time ,and felt nauseous 24/7. I chalked it up to taking new birth control and being homesick but 4 years later I realize this whole time I've been a ball of worry and anxiety. I used to love traveling, flying especially. I saved all my boarding tickets, even thought about being a flight attendant, and now the thought of getting on a plane gives me shortness of breath and tremors. I can't stand roadtrips either. I've been tracking my \"symptoms\". I've noticed that I do well with a routine, the moment I do something different, like go traveling, even if it's a weekend trip, I feel like I'm going to throw up and spend basically the entire trip super tense and nauseous, tremors, jaw clenching, etc. I've also had horrible GI issues. My husband and I are traveling out of the country in April to visit his family and it's two 7 hour flights. I don't think I'll survive it. I've scheduled an appt. With my primary care to see if I can get some medication and start therapy or something but I really don't know what to do!! Is this the right path to start on?

My psychiatrist is telling me to take two Klonopin at night but that would be 3 mg daily and I don‚Äôt wanna be on that much. I tried taking one Klonopin at night and it didn‚Äôt do nothing. I have to take a dose of NyQuil along with it so I can stay asleep. Otherwise I literally wake up every hr and can‚Äôt go bk to sleep. This is no way to live. I have a 4 1/2 year-old that I have to take care of along with my two older children who are adults. My anxiety is that debilitating due to severe past DV trauma and etc. I would so appreciate any suggestions or tips of how to possibly stay asleep if any. I‚Äôve tried a lot of things that people take and it just doesn‚Äôt work for me. My Dr just prescribed me Ambien 10 mg and it didn‚Äôt do a thing except make me wake up every hour on the dot. I believe my gabba receptors and nervous system is so jacked up from being on the Klonopin for 15 years already. I am afraid now that what I‚Äôm doing even though it is helping, is  gonna end up messing me up severely. I already grew tolerance to the NyQuil when I was taking it for a month during the holidays just so I can make Christmas happen. I‚Äôve stop taking NyQuil for a few days and I was just taking Benadryl with my Klonopin, but it still doesn‚Äôt have the same effect that the NyQuil does idk why, but the NyQuil along with the Klonopin is like magic except we all know what‚Äôs gonna end up happening. I‚Äôm gonna grow tolerance like I did prior and god knows what else. I stopped taking NyQuil for about a week, and I literally couldn‚Äôt stay asleep for 2 days.

    "selftext": "I previously posted about my bad coping habits for my anxiety. Since then, I quit my job, and I talked to my doctor about medications and was prescribed a medicine. It seemed to work! If my anxiety got too bad, I took one, and calmed down in time. My anxiety seemed to be less frequent due to no stress from work, and when I did have it, the medicine paired with healthier coping mechanisms seemed to make it manageable.\n\nToday I started back at school. I‚Äôve been out of school for years for this exact reason - anxiety and depression made it too much. But I decided to go back, because I don‚Äôt want to be stuck working minimum wage jobs that don‚Äôt pay enough to support myself and move out and all. However, it‚Äôs day one, and it‚Äôs already going terribly‚Ä¶\n\nI‚Äôve had six panic attacks today, in less than twelve hours. During my second attack, I took my medicine, it helped for a little, and then‚Ä¶ BOOM. Another stressful thing happened and triggered it again, and I couldn‚Äôt stay calm. I‚Äôm supposed to only take my medicine once every six hours as needed, so obviously I didn‚Äôt take a second one when I‚Äôd literally JUST taken one thirty minutes prior. I continued to have my fourth panic attack, got through it, and then‚Ä¶ about four hours after taking it, a fifth panic attack. I decided to try and take a second dose, since it had been a while and I‚Äôm in the lowest dosage, and well‚Ä¶ it wasn‚Äôt helping. So I went back to my old habit of self harming, and that calmed me down for a bit‚Ä¶ until I had a sixth one just now.\n\nWhat do I do? I don‚Äôt know what to do. Why does nothing help? I can‚Äôt drop out - I‚Äôve already taken thousands out on a student loan. I can‚Äôt not have a job. I need something to work to support myself. But what?\n\nWhy does nothing help me? Why does everything make me anxious? Why do I have panic attacks so bad that I can‚Äôt breathe, can‚Äôt speak, can‚Äôt move - can‚Äôt function or do anything at all? Why can‚Äôt I get through this? Why can‚Äôt I function in society like a normal human being? What am I doing wrong?\n\nI need help but I don‚Äôt know what to do. Why doesn‚Äôt anything ever work for me?

When I was a kid, I played lots of sports and if you were late to practice the coach would make you run laps or some kind of repercussion for being late, even if you weren‚Äôt old enough to drive yourself to practice. Why did the coaches do this? Or did this happen to anyone else?I‚Äôm wondering if this was possibly the start of my constant time counting or if it was just a contributing factor.

I've been out of work from about half a year and going to the gym about three times a week doing weights but never cardio. But since October my heart rate just shoots up now even just going up the stairs it goes up to 130bpm and then it will stay in the 100 standing up and then when I Lift weights or run on the treadmill. Just light intensity. Exercise will take it to 160 or 170. Yet despite all of this, the doctor say my heart is healthy and strong and nothing is wrong. I'm on beta blockers now Propranolol 10 mg which do help lower it at rest but during exercise it's still the same symptoms, As a result, I've lost a considerable amount of muscle mass. All the time I just feel on edge about this. It's unusual. It's never been like this before Is this really just anxiety?",

I need to present it with 3 group members in front of my class and i need to talk approximately 4 minutes. Normally this would not have been a problem but since the start of this school year I've suffered from terrible stage fright. Its new to me and it scares me so fucking much. I have powered through 2 presentations with it but they were both shorter (around 1 minute) and less important. I almost got a anxiety attack in front of the class but managed to barely stay calm, but im worried that i wont manage this time. The presentation is longer and as soon as I step in front of my class my heart start pounding and I start sweating and shaking profusely. This affects my performance and I am scared that I will let my group down but more importantly I will freeze in front of the class from fear and embarris myself really bad. I absolutely have to go and it is stressing me out really bad 2 days in advance. Its fucking up my sleep and I know that that will just make the fear worse. I have gotten a few tips from my doctor but I don't think that will be enough. My current plan is bringing a water bottle full of alcohol to school and drinking some beforhand to soothe my nerves. I know that that is a terrible solution but i really dont want to fuck up in front of my class so it seems like the only option. If i screw up I will be hearing that for a long time in my class. Does anyone have some tips for soothing my nerves beforehand, but most importantly stopping that discharge of adrenaline that I seem to get instantly. I cant deal with it in front of my class, it really scares me and it clouds my thinking so I wont be able to perform as well.

    "selftext": "So I'm going to try and go indepth about this. Just because I need some reassurance more than anything. But also to see if what I'm feeling/experiencing is normal. \n\nDuring December about two weeks before Christmas was when the attack started, two weeks before that I was working, I'm a supervisor at an ALF, I work very hands on and I experienced my first loss while working there. The patient I weren't close, but it was my floor(only started about four months ago). And I'm not sure if this a contributing factor. My father passed when I was 19, and he just dropped. From what my mom said he woke up from a nap, asked where the cigarettes were and was just gone. This is definitely something that's bothered me as I was in nursing school at the time, but I was away visiting my aunt and cousins. \n\nThe first attack started with an intense feeling of impending doom. I think it was sparked by a video I watched right after I woke up, about an incident a paramedic had with a patient. And how they were having a panic attack, and were fighting to get out of the ambulance. And once they got their patient to the hospital they essentially dropped dead. A few hours later I had a dump of adrenaline from a game then felt this impending doom just cover me. Ended up holding on to my roommates father's leg for dear life. He's been there for me since my father passed. And he's been helping me through this. \n\nThe next one I had was in my car, I was trying to get somewhere and I hit a red light, I got agitated and the next thing I know my heart is trying to break my rib cage, I'm hyperventilating, and my hands and feet are pins and needles to the point I got out of my car to seek help because I thought I was having a heart attack. Luckily someone I knew was in the car behind me, and they helped me catch my breath and sat with me for about 10 minutes at this light till I could drive again. This would happen again but I caught myself and started breathing through it. And manage to get to where I'm going. \n\nI had another come on when I took an antibiotic without eating and lost all feeling in my stomach. Ended up having an intense reaction again and nearly passed out, black reaching the edges of my eyes, whole body was pins and needles. And I'm hyperventilating again. one of my roommates gets ice and hands it to me and tells me to put it on my neck and it almost completely stops and about all of five seconds. \n\nSince then I've been getting better at catching the little signs of an on coming panic attack I'll go grab some ice and start breathing through it. It happens a lot after I eat, and seems to be when I have gas, like a belch will flow up my throat and make my heart flutter and I'll start to panic. A lot of my anxiety seems to be centered around my heart. \n\nI seem to be dissociating a lot, and derealizating as well. I'll be moving my hand and know I did that, but when I look at my hand I'm like that's not right. My back seems to be extremely tight and causes my arms to feel extremely awkward, like they are floating and not really attached to my body. I'm zoning out a lot, and seeing more spots on my vision then normal. Like when you stare at a bright light for to long and the spot the light was travels with your eye sight for a moment. Heart palpitations are setting me off too.  And while I don't feel like I'm experiencing brain fog, it feels like only half my brain is working. I've felt no real pain when these attacks happen, at least from what I can tell. \n\nToday I twisted while picking something up at work, and my torso hurt for less then a second and that set me off. I had a few moments of intense want to run away, and the feeling felt like it was radiating through my body. But the panic attack last about 30 mins before the feelings pasted. The first three panic attacks I had lasted hours. And left me feeling wrong for days. Even now I don't feel completely like myself. \n\nThis is a long post, and I appreciate anyone who makes it through. I've never experienced anything like this before, and I'm terrified. ",

For context, I‚Äôm the only one who is overweight, they are all very skinny. For as long as I‚Äôve known them, I‚Äôve never eaten in front of them‚Äîwhether we‚Äôre at a restaurant or hanging out, I always just order water. They‚Äôve never really asked why, except for friend A, who has commented a couple of times. I‚Äôve always been defensive or brushed it off.\n\nI think I feel embarrassed to eat in front of them because I‚Äôm the only one who‚Äôs overweight and I care about their opinions, so I avoid eating around them. Because of this, I‚Äôve even turned down trips with them in the past and made up excuses, which has created tension.\n\nNow, we‚Äôre planning a trip to a different in september 2025 after we finish our exams. I agreed to go last year, hoping that by the time the trip comes, I‚Äôll have lost enough weight to feel comfortable eating with them. But now, I‚Äôm not so sure. C has already started planning the trip, and we‚Äôre talking about hotels and places to visit. I feel like this issue might come up soon, especially since R or D might ask some questions about my eating habits. I‚Äôm stuck and don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôve thought of two options:\n\n1. Tell them in the near future (a few weeks or a month before the trip) about my food-related problem and how it could affect the trip. This would give them time to decide if they‚Äôre okay with it. My idea is that I could eat separately from them at restaurants, but it could be tough to find different places to eat every day.\n2. Tell them right before the trip (a few weeks before), hoping they won‚Äôt mind and that they understand. I‚Äôm worried that A might have a problem with this. I would suggest the option of eating at different restaurants if needed, but I‚Äôm not sure how that will go.\n\nI don‚Äôt really talk about my problems or feelings, so having this conversation would be really REALLY difficult for me. Out of the three of them, I‚Äôm especially worried about A because she might not be understanding and could even dismiss my problem. If she decides she doesn't want me to come anymore, I wouldn't blame her. Also, A has asked me multiple times to join trips or go to different places, but I always declined.\n\nI would love to go, but I don't know if it's possible.\n\nWhat should I do? Should I bring it up soon or wait until the trip gets closer? Or should I just drop the trip?\n\nThank you!",

    "selftext": "TL;DR: For 26 years I finally find out antibiotics can messed up my mental health.\n\nRecently, I have middle ear infection and took Amoxicillin 500mg x 4 for 3 days which fucked up my guts, my breathing and mental health (turns out it may be allergy because my grandma is allergy to it), then Erythromycin 250mg x 4 per day for 2 days also fucked up my anxiety too due to lots of interaction of drugs and inhibitor of CYP3A4, last one was Cefaclor 250mg x 3 for 3 days and was sent to ER yesterday due to extreme painful of ear, numbness at right side of my body, and I could't talk (but I could type), they thought it was psychogenicity and sent me back to home after lots of checking.\n\nToday I told my ENT this problem and he said yeah it might be the problem of antibiotics, he then gave me lysozyme chloride and ibuprofen to control the pain and hope the body to fight itself. FYI I'm still hard to talk but better, ear is better, and mental confusion seems to come down a little bit.\n\nThis reminds me 3 things:\n\n1. Last time I took Amoxicillin was 2024/11/2 because of sinus infection (probably caused by Depakote because of misdiagnosis as bipolar), 500mg x 4 per day. But at that time I was also taking Xyzal and Tylenol. My anxiety flared up so bad that I needed to take Ativan to control it, and my body temperature was constantly high but not enough to call it a fever. Later I took the evil Augmentin 1g for only 3 pills and I felt I'm dying, took the damn antibiotics out then I still felt bad but not that much, days after I was in a panic and been put back to Prozac (which probably not suitable for me bc it makes me easily to catch a cold), and changed back to Zoloft since 2024/12/4.\n2. Back in my days of studying in master degrees, especially 2022\\~2023, every time I took amoxicillin for flu or cold (yeah the old ENTs really like to give antibiotics for no reason), my symptoms would become worse, but I was taking Zoloft and Xanax then so the anxiety wasn't that bad (also because I was away from home so my parents won't nagging at me lol).\n3. When I was a kid, I sometimes took a green and white capsule from my mom which her called \"anti-inflammatory\" if I had a headache or something, later did I found that it's cephalexin and known to cause anxiety and depression. I was attempted to suicide before university entrance examination because at that time I took a lot of it to combat a \"drug-induced pain\".\n\nI'm taking Zoloft, Concerta and some Librium to control my anxiety, depression and narcolepsy, finally after 26 years of my life, I find out every time I take antibiotics, my mind will fucked up, and antihistamines can strangely control my anxiety sometimes, especailly if I'm having swollen shoulders. Maybe I'm always allergy to antibiotics but I don't know, and yeah SSRIs were actually developed from antihistamine so...what a strange reaction.\n\nEdit: Sorry I'm sensitive now but why the down vote? I'm not trying to against antibiotics but just asking for help or someone has similar reaction like this, and how to deal with it.",

But with my anxiety through the roof, it‚Äôs impossible for me to decide, so I‚Äôm here hoping for some feedback from anyone who‚Äôs been in a similar situation.\n\nHere‚Äôs my background: I‚Äôve been on Paxil 25mg for almost two months. The first two weeks were horrible, but then it got somewhat better. I was still super anxious, though, so my doctor added Wellbutrin 150mg, which I‚Äôve been taking for two weeks now.\n\nSince starting Wellbutrin, I‚Äôve felt horrible again‚Äîalmost like I did before starting Paxil. My symptoms include:\n\t‚Ä¢\tSevere brain fog (I literally couldn‚Äôt see shit)\n\t‚Ä¢\tForgetting everything\n\t‚Ä¢\tComplete indecision (I can‚Äôt even decide what to eat, let alone bigger choices)\n\nI told my doctor, and he advised me to stop Wellbutrin. But when I mentioned how Paxil was rough in the beginning and got better with time, I said I wanted to give Wellbutrin more time, especially because I‚Äôve read great things about it.\n\nHe explained that it‚Äôs very rare and unusual for an antidepressant to make you feel worse before it makes you feel better. He said Wellbutrin is supposed to complement Paxil, not undo its benefits. Still, I keep reading online (and hearing from my therapist) that it can get worse before it gets better, which makes me hesitant to stop.\n\nMy doctor suggested switching to Zoloft instead, but he‚Äôs leaving the decision up to me. I‚Äôve read mixed reviews about Paxil + Wellbutrin and Paxil + Zoloft combos‚Äîsome people love them, others don‚Äôt.\n\nNow I‚Äôm completely lost and spiraling with anxiety. I don‚Äôt want to make the wrong choice. Has anyone else been in a similar situation? Did you stick with Wellbutrin despite feeling bad at first, or did you move on to something else? I‚Äôd really appreciate your insights.\n\nThank you so much! ",

    "selftext": "Been struggling with nocturnal anxiety specifically, for around 2 months now following my first nocturnal panic attack, after having health anxiety beforehand for about 4 years now. This is something that has always come and gone throughout those 4 years but nocturnal anxiety is a new thing for me, and like I say it was all kicked off from a nocturnal panic attack one night. \n\nSo for the last few months I fed into it, I didn‚Äôt sleep and created bad habits for myself around nighttime. My first port of call was to fix my sleep schedule and try to get more consistent sleep, sleeping and waking up at the same time ext. This is because I know how much poor sleep can negatively affect anxiety. So I started today by implementing things that would promote good sleep. For example, less caffeine, exercising at a good time and not right before bed, walking outside getting early sunlight, not eating too late and meditating before bed. I also made sure to set an alarm to ensure I wake up at the same time everyday and I did try to go to bed a little earlier. \n\nAnd well so far so good, but not perfect. I fell asleep earlier than usual at around 12am but inevitably I woke up at around 1:30am in a slightly anxious state but far from panic, I‚Äôm writing this at 2:15am. Again getting the usual symptoms, however instead of trying to calm myself or ignore the symptoms, I actually laid in bed and invited them on to get worse, as if I wanted it to happen. I saw someone else do this and they say it worked tremendously. And it did help for sure, it definitely didn‚Äôt remove my physical anxiety symptoms but it did remove the fear surrounding them. \n\nSo as I lay here writing this post I feel pretty okay. It‚Äôs unlikely I will be able to fall back to sleep quick but I will probably try to watch something on tv until I eventually feel relaxed enough to fall back to sleep. But this is an improvement even from yesterday when I went to sleep at 4am, the fact I even managed t get to sleep by 12am surprised me, despite the fact I woke up. \n\nHas anyone else got experience with nocturnal anxiety and how did u deal with it ? Does it get better? ",

    "selftext": "Posting this from a burner, historically I've never had any depression/anxiety/any other mental health struggles, my life was great for the most part so maybe this comes from a fear of losing that.\n\nWith that said, a month ago when I was high, I tried thinking about what the sensation of being dead is like. I'm an atheist, and I think being dead is the state of nothingness, such as being asleep or before the time I was born. However, the issue is that both being asleep and the time before I was born came to an end due to me waking up/being born, and being dead does not have an end. This led to a panic attack until I fell asleep.\n\nSince then, I have had recurring intrusive thoughts revolving around three themes that cause anxiety:\n\n1. I don't know what it feels like to be dead\n2. My life is great, I want to die on my own terms and not due to some accident/disease\n3. I love my family and assuming the above doesn't happen, I'll be devastated when my parents pass\n\nFor the most part, the anxiety I feel is just doom and stress. However, lately it has been causing me to wake up earlier than normal, I feel a pit in my stomach, and my legs feel tense/tingly. When my mind is preoccupied with something else, I feel completely fine until one of the three thoughts pops up in my head, completely ruining my day. It's like \"Wow, I feel great! It's because I'm not thinking about...\". Even just thinking about this anxiety makes it worse. Furthermore, previously whenever my mind was idle, I would daydream about neutral things such as my hobbies or memories. Now, my mind is just occupied by these three thoughts and I can't daydream about anything else.\n\nIs there a path out of this, whether its stopping these thoughts from forming, or preventing these thoughts from causing anxiety and gloom?",

Recently, ive noticed that whenever i feel stressed and/or anxious, my mind spirals into the past and i start feeling anxiety about that. For example,today i discovered a new responsibility i need to take care of for work and as i felt myself getting stressed, something in my brain immediately dragged me down into my trauma, and getting anxious about that too somehow. I am a psychologist, and can at least recognize that my brain falls into that pattern bc its familiar to my brain, dealing with that experience for so many years. But, the teacher still needs to be a student too. Does anyone else experience this and how are you able to keep your mind off of the past experience, and focused on the now?

    "title": "THC has given me anxiety every night. Please help!",
    "selftext": "I‚Äôm 20 years old and I started smoking weed  (mostly THC) in December 2021. Every day since then I‚Äôve practically smoked at least my THC pen or pot, and it was never really a problem. I noticed after a while I started to get social anxiety after I smoked and preferred to be alone and work out or listen to music. I loved weed so much until after I went on a three month trip overseas. While I was overseas, there was absolutely no access to any marijuana or THC which I didn‚Äôt mind because I wanted to take a tolerance break anyways. I had so much fun on my trip and just returned a few days before Thanksgiving (2024). Please note that I became a pretty avid caffeine drinker while I was overseas and brought the habit back when I returned to America. Upon coming home, I decided to buy another THC pen and got high almost every day until the Wednesday before Christmas. That I had a lot of caffeine, and hit my pen multiple times throughout the day. That night before I went to bed, I had decided to take two good hits of my Looper disposable. (I had used so many Looper disposables in the past so I trusted the brand). Guys. When I tell you, this was the most terrifying night of my life. I kid you not. I was up for seven hours pacing around my room in the bathroom feeling like I was having a heart attack and it felt like my neck was getting stabbed every few minutes. My body was shaking, and I was profusely sweating. I legitimately thought I got a laced pen (even though I was hitting it the previous days and felt fine). I ended up staying up all night and the day after I ate a Hardy meal and drink some water and ultimately after that night I did feel better. It doesn‚Äôt end there though.\nI decided to throw away that looper pen and get another, which seemed to not have as extreme effects, but I noticed that my throat would always feel constricted and I would get this weird sensation in my head every few minutes that was very uncomfortable. As a THC fein, I was determined to keep smoking at least a little bit every day because it would help me during my gym sessions and as a musician I felt like it made music sound 100% better. Fast-forward to this previous Thursday Night, January 16, I hit my pen around 9:30pm before going to bed and felt completely fine and ended up going to sleep. Maybe around three in the morning I woke up to a horrifying sensation in my brain and my body was shaking. It felt like my body was going through ‚Äúwaves‚Äù of the beginning of a heart attack. I was unable to go to sleep that night but in the morning, I honestly felt fine. Here‚Äôs the thing: I am STILL unable to get a full nights sleep without waking up to this feeling, and it only comes at night when I‚Äôm trying to get rest. So here‚Äôs my question. Are there anyone else who has ever felt this way and is this something that can be undone?? And what is causing this? Was it the copious amount of caffeine over the weeks mixed with my indulgence with THC? Honestly, at this point, I‚Äôve pretty much accepted that I can‚Äôt smoke THC or weed again but it seems like this anxiety at night will NOT go away. it‚Äôs been four nights now I‚Äôm genuinely upset that after all these years of using THC to feel good it has turned on me and made my body feel like it‚Äôs essentially shutting down. I would really like to hear feedback on the situation and see if anyone else has similar experiences because this is a bizarre feeling. Almost feels like it‚Äôs never gonna end.",

I still suffer to this day with dp/dr but not with its full capacity, there are still things I have trouble understanding and I still haven‚Äôt been able to help the fogginess.\n\nI will say tho that I have brought myself a long way from when I first started this journey, made excellent improvements and crazy discoveries within my own mind and body. \n\nRecovering isn‚Äôt as hard as you might think so don‚Äôt panic okay? Doctors might say this is permanent but I promise you it‚Äôs not and has never been, this just like any sickness is a temporary condition and will eventually all go away.\n\nNow this does not just go away in one day, it takes time just like anything in this world does so keep patience okay? The first order of business is don‚Äôt be scared of dp/dr okay? I know it‚Äôs easier said then done but trust me this is the first step to recovery, fear will put that sickness in more control, you have to let it know that you are not scared of it and keep moving forward.\n\nSecond step to recovery is to do things that challenge your fear, by being afraid you will instinctively isolate yourself, challenge your fears, go on walks, talk to friends even if it is scary, go do some activities like working out, cleaning the house, making your bed, reading books stuff like that. The more you get comfortable with this sickness the more it goes away.\n\nThe one issue I ran into was second guessing my own thoughts and emotions, trust me when I say that you do not have to do that because everything you‚Äôre feeling is true and it‚Äôs you. \n\nI found that watching movies helps a lot just be careful as to not getting to involved with the movie because this sickness will not like that. Be calm, breathe and slowly inch your way into the movie just as you would do for anything else. \n\nDon‚Äôt force this to get better, you will have your off days and you will have your good days and those good days will feel amazing trust me they will but don‚Äôt be scared when it comes back just except that it‚Äôs there understand that your still recovering and continue with your day.\n\nBy doing activities yes you will get to the point where you know deep down you did those things but at the same time you will feel as tho you never did it and that‚Äôs completely normal because what that is is it‚Äôs your mind thinking your in a life or death situation and it thinks you can‚Äôt handle this so it makes you go blank.\n\nI fought this battle and I‚Äôve made amazing progress and I know you can too! Reach out, talk to people who have also experienced this and recovered or are still recovering trust me your not alone, there are more people going through this then you might expect.\n\nIf you have any questions feel free to reach out and ask I‚Äôm always here, thank you for your time.",

On Saturday, I took my adderal around 11/12ish and then a few hours later (when I remembered) I took my pristiq. I took my Pristiq around 3/3:30PM, but I usually take it around 9AM every day for work. \n\nAbout 30 mins later- I started feeling the worst anxiety and paranoia I‚Äôve ever felt that went on for hours. Before going on pristiq- I struggled with bad anxiety but never anxiety or panic attacks. Since I‚Äôve never really experienced a panic attack- my mind immediately convinced myself that I was ‚Äúoverdosing‚Äù on my adderal that I take pretty consistently. My face was numb, non stop shaking, heart racing, chest pain, and sharp anxiety pains that would come and go (which I believe now were ‚Äúbrain zaps‚Äù). \n\nThis went on for HOURS and around 10:30 PM after trying everything from cold and hot showers, breathing exercises, walking around and sitting, trying to distract myself, eating, taking hydroxyzine and melatonin; I eventually decided to call myself an uber to the ER because my delusional mind had convinced I was overdosing and having a heart attack. \n\nAfter the nurse confirmed my vitals were all OK (other than blood pressure & heart rate obviously) & my EKG came back normal- it was almost instantly that I began to calm down. Just mentally knowing my EKG was normal and that I wasn‚Äôt going to have a heart attack or seizure, I guess is all I needed to calm down. \n\nCan taking Pristiq only a few hours later than normal cause all of this? I‚Äôve never struggled with panic attacks, and I was under the assumption that you have to fully miss a dose for the withdrawal symptoms of Pristiq to occur. Maybe I‚Äôm wrong. I know Pristiq can cause brain zaps, which I‚Äôve never felt before- but I believe the ‚Äúzaps‚Äù are what really convinced me I was dying since it is such a unique sensation that I‚Äôve never experienced. It felt like my entire body would twitch and a wave of sharp panic would rush through my body for only a second. So extremely terrifying. \n\nI still have some lingering anxiety even a few days later and after I‚Äôve returned to taking my pristiq at my normal time. \n\nJust wondering if this has happened to anyone else? I‚Äôm honestly embarrassed about the entire encounter and honestly confused as to why this happened to me. ",

I feel anxiety literally always to one degree or another. I can't remember the last time I was just relaxed. I recently saw a neurologist. I told her about my symptoms: perpetual anxiety, poor sleep, irritability, panic attacks, inability to sit still. The doctor said it's nothing serious and my nervous system is just overloaded. She gave me a prescription for pills, which I bought the same day. It's been a week now, I've been taking the medication steadily. In part, I have actually gotten better. At least I stopped waking up in the middle of the night and feeling very anxious during the day. But my symptoms haven't completely gone away, and the more I think about it, the worse I feel.\n\nI suffer from cardiophobia, and every chest pain or high heart rate feels like the end of everything. It makes it hard for me to fall asleep. When I hear my heartbeat lying on my side it makes me anxious. I've had a hard time getting out of the habit of constantly checking my pulse and blood pressure. But I still feel like something is wrong with my heart, especially when it feels like it's fluttering in my chest. I did an EKG and it showed some abnormalities that were normal like the doctor said. I'm going to see the cardiologist again in a few days because I can't shake the feeling that the previous doctor might have missed something.\n\nMy cardiophobia started after one of my panic attacks a few months ago. Lately, I often feel like I'm dying. Even now as I write this I feel like something bad is about to happen. It scares me insanely. I literally can't just sit/lay still. I'm constantly swinging my leg, twitching on purpose, tossing and turning. If I don't, my anxiety increases dramatically. I always wake up early in the morning. It's not a slow lazy wake up. I wake up quickly, check the time, and start to feel like something bad is about to happen. I miss so much the times when I fell asleep quickly, slept long and uninterrupted and woke up rested. \n\nI'm just so tired of feeling all of that. I can't enjoy life because even when I feel good in my head I just randomly have the thought \"what if I die now\". It's like I'm constantly in my head and my whole life is passing me by while I feel anxiety again. I feel like I've forgotten what it means to truly be okay. \n\nI apologize for such a long text. I really needed to share what I'm feeling. Thank you to everyone who reads this.",

    "title": "Generalized Anxiety and 4th Day on Lexapro",
    "selftext": "TW: health anxiety and hypochondria, panic attacks\n\nI am in my 30s, and overall have been pretty anxiety free. When I was a kid, I would always be afraid of people dying, me dying, people leaving and not coming back, etc. This fear has come and went throughout most my life, resulting in pretty significant distress and maybe a mini panic attack every couple years. I do remember several times around the age of 10-14 where I would go outside because I felt like I couldn't breathe and would check to see if my fingernails were turning blue. Now that I am typing this out, I suppose I have never been anxiety free lol. Wow.\n\nAnyway, at 28 I had a full blown panic attack when I found out I had fatty liver disease. This heightened state of anxiety lasted two days and my face had this crazy tingling sensation on one side that eventually convinced me to go to the ER, thinking I was having a stroke or something. Of course, everything was fine. Ever since that big panic attack I have been dealing with almost daily anxiety. Occasionally I would go weeks or months feeling pretty good. Other times, I would spend days feeling like I was on the brink of a panic attack.\n\nA month ago, I had another panic attack after seeing a patient with mouth cancer. Due to ear and mouth pain I had been having, I was convinced I had mouth cancer. I was puking, crying, having diarrhea. My face began to tingle again, I felt disease, short of breath, and like my throat was closing. I left work to go to a walk in to get it checked out and the issue was that I had fluid behind my ear. Over the next 4 weeks I continued to go in and out of crying and panicking fits thinking there was something wrong. The tingling on my face persisted, and by that time I was convinced I had MS or a brain tumor or aneurysm. I was afraid to go to sleep or walk alone thinking I could collapse at any second.\n\nAfter my first panic attack I went to a place that taught about meditation and really got into it. It was the only thing that helped in addition to some of the mantras I would repeat to myself. Ever since these have helped me, but they only bring me temporary relief in the moment. I knew I could no longer live like this.\n\nI scheduled an appointment with a psychiatrist and she was really great. I couldn't have been luckier. I was started on lexapro and have been taking it for 4 days. I know most say it can take weeks to feel a difference, but I swear by the 2nd day I have noticed a change. One of the biggest being my mind is not CONSTANTLY active. I don't think of or plan conversations before they happen. I am not thinking of my future 4 decades in advance. I do not think of and fear and cry about me or my wife getting old and dying. My face hasn't tingled or felt like it is having microspasms for the past few days. The pressure in my forehead is gone. I haven't felt sick to my stomach (except today because I drank coffee- anytime my stomach feels bad I feel anxious, and vice versa). My breathing feels clearer, not really sure what that's about & maybe it's a placebo thing...or just the relief I feel in my body? I have had issues with brain fog but I also have sleep apnea and use CPAP but when my nose is really stuffed up I can't use it so I am not sure if that has improved yet or if it is related to anxiety or not so the verdict is still out on that one. Yesterday, I felt my brain fog was \"deeper\" in my mind, more central, rather than in my forehead if that makes sense, and then it lifted a few hours after I took my lexapro, but it could be that it dissipated once I got enough blood and oxygen flowing up there because I didnt use my cpap the night before lol.\n\nI want to say that I am a very skeptical person and that after some bad experiences with psychedelics I was terrified of medication because I was terrified of having that feeling like I wasn't myself. After only 4 days I will say that I am upset that I didn't do this sooner. My mind feels relatively clear. I am living in the present. I feel more focused. I feel less fidgety. I actually don't think I've been shaking my legs for days now, and I don't feel like I'm going to explode if I'm not shaking them. My jaw isn't clenched. The only thing that I notice is that now that my mind isn't constantly active, I sometimes find myself just kind of staring into the imaginary abyss, not thinking, just sitting..but not worrying, or planning, or catastrophically thinking, or feeling a pain in my body thinking it's some disease. It's not a bad thing, just different. Now that my mind isn't so busy, I think I will finally have the mental capacity to do all the things I'd want to do but never start. I have even felt like leaving the house the past 2 days! I don't worry as much about my wife getting in a wreck or shot or anything like that. I think I may have ADHD as well, but I want to give this a couple months before I do anything else in terms of medication. Anyway, if you have any questions about lexapro or my experience just comment!",

For the most part we communicate really well. But sometimes it breaks down and we have some sort of argument & then she gets quiet because she‚Äôs upset.\n\nI understand she‚Äôs probably not in the talking mood when we just had that argument. But when I feel her pull back like that it really starts to eat me on the inside & I start to over analyze every small interaction we have, and then my mind immediately jumps to ‚Äúshe‚Äôs going to breakup with me‚Äù or ‚Äúshe cheated on me, she‚Äôs talking to someone else‚Äù. It becomes difficult for me to sleep & focus on my work. I work in tech so I feel pressure to perform there, and maintaining that high performance is hard when anxiety is eating me up.\n\nI‚Äôd like to take better control over my anxiety and in those moments of silence learn to be okay, and somehow trust myself that no matter what happens, even if I found out she cheated or something, that I‚Äôll be okay, and I‚Äôll be strong, and move forward.

    "selftext": "\nFirst off, I know I'm probably gonna get lots of hate and criticism for this post, since this is reddit. Also, all of this is probably made worse right now by me PMSing real bad.\n\nI spent years feeling sad and worthless because no matter how I tried, no one wanted me romantically. No one ever asked me out, had a crush on me, or showed any interest in me, except for ONE guy back when we were teens. I tried online dating. It was always \"I'm sorry, but this isn't going to work out, we don't have the right chemistry, youre not my type, I'm not physically attracted to you...\" etc etc. Either that or they'd block me as soon as they saw pics of me. If I got a crush on someone, thet never liked me back. The one time I was brave enough to shoot my shot, I ended up getting rejected with all the reasons why I wasn't right for him. I know it's probably partly because I'm not attractive at all.\n\nBack in October, I made an online friend. We'll call him L. L and I got along super well, and in November we both admitted we really liked each other and are now in a LDR.\n\nThe first month or so was amazing. We were both so happy. He was SO sweet to me, always telling me such sweet and adorable things. He made me feel so loved and wanted all the time. He was also super caring. If I was sad or not feeling well (which happens often bc of my chronic illness) he would tell me how sad it made him, how he wished he were here to look after me and comfort me, tell me what he'd do if he were here to take care of me, etc. \n\nHe would tell me the sweetest things all the time like \"Sometimes I wonder if you're just a dream I will wake up from because I just can't believe you are real, you're so perfect, I'm obsessed with you, I wish I could make you see how absolutely beautiful I find you, if my coworkers ask me why I'm so happy I will just tell them I'm talking to this amazing girl...\" \n\nFast forward in January, I still get a little bit of affection, but nothing like the way he was in the first month. He doesn't say things like that anymore. I can tell he doesn't feel as strongly for me anymore. He is not really caring anymore. If I'm sad or ill it's just \"Goodnight, hope you feel better.\" No affection or care or empathy. \n\nI'm convinced he is losing interest in me. The only thing is, I'm not sure if he really is, or if I'm just being overly anxious/OCD/overthinking. From the beginning, I did have a slight fear that he would stop liking me or lose interest in me and now this fear has just gone out of control and taken over everything. This has made me clingy, made me constantly try too hard to make him like me, made me overanalyze everything he says and does. I don't even enjoy the time I spend with him anymore. I'm too stressed and sad. I almost want to break up with him or ghost him because I can't handle this anymore. I want to save my heart before it gets broken.\n\nWay back in the beginning, I told him I was just waiting for the day he tells me he doesn't want me anymore. He responded lovingly and emphatically \"You will be waiting forever!\". Nowadays, occasionally I bring up or hint at the fear that he will lose interest in me. He gives me very matter of fact, affectionless replies like \"Well if I do, that's on me, it's not a you problem\" and \"We can still be friends if that happens\". I couldn't stand to just be friends with him. I've fallen for him too hard \n\nI cry a lot and feel sad because I think he's losing interest in me and I feel worthless, unloved, unwanted, not good enough. I should have known that someone actually wanting me was impossible. \n\nAnother thing that has been tearing me apart is that he's made it clear that he doesn't love me, he only likes me. He wants to wait until he means it to tell me he loves me. But at this point, I don't think he will ever love me. This breaks my heart into pieces, because I love him. I cry about it so much. It tears me apart.\n\nThe last issue here is that earlier this month, he got REALLY mad and we had an argument and actually didn't talk for a day because he found out that a year ago I got taken advantage of. He acted like I had purposely cheated on him and then lied to him about it (didn't tell him till this month). I thought he was going to end it to me. He said he has to sympathy for what happened to me because all I had to do was say no or stop talking to the guy once I knew things weren't right. \n\nYesterday was the straw that broke the camel's back. I read a post by a girl who had also been taken advantage of and was afraid to tell her long distance bf. She finally told him, and his response was SO perfect and so genuinely loving and caring. I could tell he loves and cares for her so much. This is so selfish, but reading about his reaction broke my heart with jealousy and sadness. If my bf really cared and wanted me, that's the way he would have reacted.\n\n I had already been super anxious and sad thinking about my bf losing interest in me. This post broke me and I cried for 5 hours. I still feel messed up this morning. My bf knew I went to bed crying and very sad last night (I blamed PMS). But all he said was \"Whats making you so sad?\" and \"Hope you feel better.\" In the beginning, if I cried, he would tell me how he wished he was here for me, tell me how sad it made him that I was sad, and tell me he wished he could cuddle me until I felt better \n\nI'm just so sad, and the anxiety this relationship is causing me is too much to handle. I was happier when we were just friends. I know that nobody wants me. Nobody loves me romantically and they never will. I'm not good enough, not pretty enough, not special enough, not worthy of love. Please give me advice. \n",

I‚Äôve also been depressed and with very high stress due to personal reasons and it‚Äôs basically lowered my libido to the point I never even think about sex, and it‚Äôs just so weird because I used to be very active with my exes. I‚Äôve found it hard to explain my anxiety to him, he feels like there‚Äôs something wrong with him and i feel super guilty because it‚Äôs not his fault at all. \n\nI just feel like I‚Äôll end up self sabotaging and ruining everything. I don‚Äôt want to lose him because I really love him and I want this to work. I guess I‚Äôm just looking for advice from people who have been in similar situations.

Has anyone found a job where they can work alone and earn well without the leadership stress?\n\n\\------------------------------------\n\nHey there! I (40F) have a GAD diagnosis, social anxiety, and a high-masking introvert personality. After several years, I‚Äôve managed to get it all under control through medication, therapy, and exercise. Most aspects of my life are going well, and I‚Äôm proud of how far I‚Äôve come. However, every single anxiety attack I experience stems from work.\n\nI love working alone and enjoy solving strategic problems. I‚Äôve worked hard to become a specialist in several areas. But I always end up in leadership roles because, as an overthinker, I tend to come up with unique solutions. People see this as a superpower, so when they notice my ability to find solutions others don‚Äôt, they often promote me to lead teams and train others to do what I do.\n\nHere‚Äôs the problem: I don‚Äôt like people, I don‚Äôt enjoy training them, and I never wanted to be a people leader. I‚Äôve tried approaching it methodologically, but I just can‚Äôt seem to make it work. Additionally, a higher role means more exposure, which leads to stuttering and a foggy brain in front of extroverted colleagues who don‚Äôt seem to understand what anxiety feels like.\n\nI‚Äôve changed jobs several times, but I always find myself at the same point: starting strong, getting a team, and eventually entering the ‚ÄúI hate everyone and everything‚Äù phase. This increases my anxiety attacks and leaves me counting down the days until retirement.\n\nMy last anxiety attack was especially brutal, and I ended up hurting myself. Has anyone else experienced this? Did you manage to find a job where you work alone and earn decent pay? I‚Äôd really appreciate any input. Thanks so much for reading this rant!",

    "selftext": "Hi, so this is my first post on here after finding a few others that I could relate to in some ways, but not fully. This is really to see if anyone else deals with what I do in terms of an anxiety response - this has been an issue for me the past 4 years. It's a niche issue which no one else fully understands, and that leaves me feeling quite isolated - there's comfort in community, so I guess I just wanted to reach out and see if anyone can relate or has experienced something similar.\n\nAlthough this has been a major issue for me for the last 4 years, it actually started around 11 years ago. I was about 18/19 and I can't remember the exact moment, but my stomach made an awkward noise at one point, and I became really self conscious about it. When I say noise I don't mean like a stomach rumble, I mean like a stomach fart, it's the only way I can describe it, and I kinda feel it happening in my rectum rather than main stomach area, but I'm not releasing gas. It actually took me a long time to realise that the noise would happen specifically because I would hold in gas (if I was in a situation I could not release it in), and after several attempts to release, it moves back up to my stomach and triggers the noise which kinda sounds like a fart anyway - I saw someone on a separate thread describe it as 'all the embarrassment, none of the relief' which is spot on üòÇ\n\nI then would worry about it happening in certain situations, like hanging out with friends, or in a lecture; I had to leave the room one time because I was so worried it would happen. However, this was at a pretty low level, and as soon as I was out of the situation, I wouldn't think about it. This went on for several years (about 8) - I would worry about it and I would get really nervous in certain situations, but then as soon as I was out of the situation, I wouldn't think about it until the next time.\n\nWhen I was 26/27 I started a new job in an office, it was a completely different environment to anywhere I'd worked before (my previous job we had the radio on, I had 3 breaks a day, it was quite chatty and casual and you could work on different reception desks). In the new office, save for phone calls, it was so silent you could hear a pin drop and there was only a small group of us working in the office. This was my worst nightmare because of my issue and I just went into complete meltdown mode. Every day I had to go into the office, I would wake up feeling sick, start wretching so violently I would almost throw up, would wretch all the way to work on the tube, the street, and when I got to work I would have diarrhoea all day, I couldn't eat, I ended up losing about half a stone there over a couple of months. It was hell. My body was trying to tell me to get the hell out of there. I ended up deciding to leave because I couldn't cope anymore, but amazingly giving my mind that release, my symptoms actually stopped, and I was able to stay there. However, I didn't deal with the root of the problem, and a few months later this started showing up in the other areas of my life. I started having anxiety attacks in certain situations which basically just consisted of me getting awful diarrhoea and feeling really nauseous. These situations consisted of the theatre, comedy club, hairdressers, eyelash appointments - and worst of all, I would get it every time I got called into the managers office for a chat (which was very regularly). I realised the trigger is anywhere I can't easily leave (or it would be awkward/embarrassing to leave) and for it to be quiet enough to hear a stomach noise. It was hell and I'm still struggling with it 4 years later.\n\nI ended up doing hypnotherapy which was amazing - it managed to stop these reactions and I felt incredible for the first time in a long time. I still had the fear about the stomach noises though, but I'm not sure I'll ever be rid of that. However, around 7/8 months after doing hypnotherapy, I got triggered by a life event and all my symptoms came back ten fold. I had a new job at that point which I loved, but it got so bad to the point I was going to the toilet over 10 times in a couple of hours because my stomach issues just wouldn't stop and just being in the office became a trigger again. I had to have time off work. My hypnotherapist wasn't really helpful the second time round - he helped a bit, but he didn't have a lot of answers and it wasn't quite working in the same way as before. He ended up saying that we 'failed' and he couldn't do anymore to help me - we had to stop having sessions. I've since done CBT, EMDR, and none of it's worked. I'm now seeing another hypnotherapist, but I hate to say I feel a little skeptical.\n\nAs of now, I'm struggling with diarrhoea every time I have a work meeting, and in other areas like beauty appointments and the theatre which I love going to üò¢ it's basically become a conditioned fear response in my body and because of past experiences, my mind recognises certain situations as (incorrectly) dangerous, and is triggering my flight response to get out of there to safety. It's really evolved from the fear of stomach noises and now it's so difficult to live my life when I get scared and uncomfortable in so many normal every day situations. However, the fear of stomach noises is still there even if I don't get the diarrhoea, as that was the original fear which I think to some extent I can never be fully rid of. Being in a work meeting or an appointment with your eyes taped shut and having to hold in explosive diarrhoea is awful!! I've also struggled on dates, when I sleep next to someone new I can't sleep the entire night because my body won't let me and I'm worried I might make a noise. I've had anxiety attacks when staying over at someone's before and I've had to leave a date early because I got surprised with a comedy club on the date and got super uncomfortable and had to get out of there üôÉ\n\nHas anyone had anything similar? I would be grateful to know if any therapy I haven't tried has been helpful for this kind of issue, as I really don't know what to do anymore. Sorry for the super long post - not sure anyone will be arsed to read this, But it was pretty cathartic to write üòÇ",

He proceeded to ask every woman to fistbump or shake his hand. His hand was extremely dirty but the women did it anyway. It was clear that they were not pleased with this and were feeling nervous. I felt really uncomfortable by this and didn‚Äôt want to feel pressured in having to touch a stranger, so I just laughed it off but didn‚Äôt touch him at all. He proceeded to follow me, making suggestive comments and getting extremely up close and personal. In that moment I felt in danger and like it could escalate to something horrible happening. I had a panic attack in the store. \n\nEventually one of the employees managed to make him leave, and later on when I spotted him a few streets away, he was getting arrested. \n\nIncidents like these only further fuel my fears of the dangers that lie outside. How am supposed to reassure myself like my counsellor said before by saying that all my fears are just in my head, when things like this happen? \n",

And sure, I know there‚Äôs a part of being anxious that people might say is ‚Äúall in your head,‚Äù but I think it‚Äôs so much more than that. It‚Äôs not just in the head‚Äîit‚Äôs trauma that‚Äôs literally trapped in the body. There are experiences in life that caused this.\n\nI can remember moments where I wasn‚Äôt as anxious, and I‚Äôm working really hard to get back to those moments. But yeah, it‚Äôs hard, because sometimes mental health challenges aren‚Äôt visible from the outside. It‚Äôs easy for others to discredit them or to assume it should be simple to just ‚Äústop‚Äù the symptoms.\n\nWhen I think about it, though, the parasympathetic nervous system (you know, the system responsible for calming the body) is often in overdrive for years in many cases of anxiety. Switching from that constant state of fight-or-freeze mode to a balanced and calm state isn‚Äôt something the body even recognizes as normal. It takes practice, deliberate effort, and a lot of unlearning and undoing negative behavioral patterns before you can start to see certain effects ease up.",

    "selftext": "Hi! I‚Äôve been experiencing general anxiety for more than half a year now. Since I study psychology, I knew I needed to start therapy right away and did so (a mix of somatic and trauma-informed methods) and it has worked wonders on the way I process experiences mentally, and I feel really balanced in mind, however, somatic sympthoms like nausea or troubles with sleeping persist and often makes me feel disconnected from my body. So I decided to consult a psychiatrist, who put me on autogenic training and 15mg of Mirtazapine (her reasoning was that the nausea [and thus disordered eating and weight loss, I was underweight to begin with] and disorganised sleep pattern doesn‚Äôt allow my vegetative nervous system to regulate itself and regenerate) \n\nMy reasoning to seek out a psychiatrist wasn‚Äôt to get medication but for a doctor to see if I have any indications of an underlying medical condition that could perhaps perpetuate my physical symptoms (everything seems to be fine except my vitamin D levels, though I do have my own doubts about my endocrine system for other reasons) but medication is what I‚Äôve got! I‚Äôve been a bit iffy about going on them in general but she‚Äôs got a great point about how it could help the eating and sleep disorders, which in turn could alleviate my physical symptoms, so I‚Äôll consult my therapist too and might give it a try.\n\nWhat I‚Äôve wanted to ask is did anyone with similar troubles try this medication, and if so, how was it?

    "selftext": "I simply don't know what to do so I guess I'll start at the beginning. I'm 46 and have been experiencing sharp chest pains and crippling attacks that feel like I'm having a heart attack. Very sporadic poking in my heart area, tingling up the back of my neck, left arm is fluctuating and pulsating, can't breathe. A trip to the ER and 2 EKGs + blood work show I'm not having a heart attack. 1st EKG Dr said benign repolarization which is basically athletes heart and occurs in 25% of elite athletes. I saw a cardiologist in 2022 for palpitations and aside from a slightly enlarged heart she also found athletes heart. This is different than before, my heart is constantly bounding meaning I can feel it all the time especially when I try to sleep so I'm not sleeping at all maybe 3 hours a night. People in my life think it's panic attacks so my gf is an NP and ordered me Xanax Friday night. Normally Xanax knocks me in my fanny. Heart started Fri night, after 15 minutes Xanax made it stop. Saturday morning another hardcore attack happened but trying to deal with it naturally I put a meditation video on and rocked back and forth. When I came to I was covered in snot and tears with an overwhelming sense of loneliness and abandonment. Another attack last night took half a Xanax .25 mgs but after 20 minutes it didn't help so took another. After 25 minutes they went away but the usual very loopy and groggy feeling I'VE ALWAYS HAD wasn't there. I've never taken that much and I felt normal. We took our dogs out and when I came home hour or so later body was heavy but I was still shocked at how normal I felt. Prior to all this happening I felt like Deniro in Analyze this. Thought panic attacks that felt like heart attacks were impossible, it just didn't compute for me. I also never understood how people took Xanax and felt normal. \n\nThis started 10 days ago and has gotten significantly worse since last Thursday. Growing up in Hell's Kitchen, my close circle of friends in highschool are either dead or in jail. Mid 90s were just different I guess and can't control who you vibe with. I went to the Marines in 2000 and had 2 deployments to Iraq and 1 to Afghanistan. Anyone I was close with was killed or they now live on the other side of the country. I hit the girlfriend lottery, I'm amazed at how lucky I am. She's the most supportive and genuinely good human I've ever been around. I don't need much, her our dogs and my plants I'm the richest lad in the world. Not close with my family since my Mom passed and tbh wasn't very close before that either. When I came home from the Marines I'm a people person but couldn't be around anyone. Id feel uncomfortable on trains after a few stops, couldn't sleep but nothing like this. If there's a sudden loud noise like thunder, fireworks etc the WiFi in my brain shuts off and I'm basically catatonic for a few minutes. Awake and aware but trapped inside my body. It's something I've had to disclose on every first date because that's something a potential partner should know before getting involved. Doesn't happen often but it does happen. If I prepare myself and expect it im fine but who can predict gnarly thunder lol. \n\nSince I came home I've unintentionally pushed people away. I can talk to someone at Lowe's for an hour but any relationships I don't pursue or put effort in if that makes sense. Growing up I switched schools K-9 9x (not exaggerating) so I've always had gift of gab but anyone I get close to gets taken from me so that + the trauma from the Marines developing close relationships has been difficult. I'm seeing a cardiologist the 31st, earliest I can get in but these attacks keep happening. I'm 6'5\" 260 lbs and have been in elite shape my entire life. The last 7 months I've had two major surgeries. Torn meniscus in June and rebuilt my inner and middle ear end of November so I've taken a lot of time off from gym and my body is very very tight. I had just started lifting heavy again when these pains started except I know what those feel like. I do cupping at home, electric stim, massage gun, have a candy cane looking massage thing that is able to get huge knots out but hurts like hell. Haven't seen my acupuncturist in a bit and she thinks I have thoracic other syndrome but the other stuff is anxiety. I was convinced Friday I was having cardiac arrest. The fact that Xanax works within a few minutes and I've felt normal afterwards, maybe I've suppressed things I've tried really hard to forget and it's bursting through my subconscious. \n\nSaw the head navy shrink upon discharging and told him what I've shared. Couldn't sleep, uncomfortable around people, anytime I see a helicopter (long story), the loud noises etc. He writes me a script but it's 120 Oxy 80s. I said \"sir I don't have cancer I just want to feel normal again.\" He replied and I quote, \"you grunts never cease to amaze me. You all walk in here and think you know everything. You want to contribute to the growing epidemic of serviceman that have taken their own life go right ahead but please sign here showing you're refusing treatment please.\" Never forgot that moment. I can still smell the room like it was yesterday. I was stunned and initial reaction was GFYS so I never went back and tried on my own. Nature, the beach, gym and music all seemed to help and I'm a lot luckier than most. Turns out they did this to every one in my unit and I'm assuming others. \n\nI know I need therapy and need to commit to it like I have squats. These attacks are crippling and my EKG and blood show I'm not having heart attacks but they feel so real and they're the scariest thing I've ever experienced. If you've made it this far, thank you. I genuinely don't know what to do because there are people saying crap like \"you get the vaccine?\" which I did but telling me that isn't helping calm me down. I've never felt this scared and hoping this ends yesterday. Feels like something sharp poking my heart, very sporadic and I only feel these pains abd weird feelings on my left side. When I went to hospital it felt like 250 pounds standing on my chest. ",

In the process of scanning through my items I had accidentally dropped a bottle of foundation and it dropped everywhere making a huge mess and i just felt so embarrassed and stressed in the moment. there were other costumers surrounding the area i was in and an employee approached me and instead of offering to help clean it up i was kicked out of the store and accused of shoplifting which had never happened to me before. the whole situation was stressful and i had left the store crying, i tried to come back today to speak to them about the incident even though i was having a bad panic attack and i have a huge fear of confrontation. they did not apologize for the situation whatsoever and just gave poor excuses for the employees behaviour. i have\nstruggled with panic disorder for years as well as agoraphobia in the past and honestly this whole interaction has made me not want to go shopping in person ever again because i fear this will happen again.

As many people have described, and i myself had to deal with, any social interaction, or presentation, etc, i‚Äôd get so extremely anxious that i would start shaking, sweating, stuttering, etc. \n\nOntop of my general anxiety, i had an anxiety induced nightmare about a (very specific) white 18 wheeler truck crashing into me and had to work the next day, at the time i was a server at a restaurant so that required me having STEADY non shaky hands. I couldn‚Äôt even get to work without having a giant panic attack. On the highway my hands just began to shake, and shake, and shake to the point where it was a full on tremor and unsafe for me to drive so i pulled over and freaked out a bit and was able to make it to work and luckily my manager was like ‚Äúhoney, just, take the day off‚Äù so i had my family pick me and my car up. \n\nat this point i was so over being chained down by this and needed to do something so i went to see my doctor. i explained, the fact i did NOT like traditional ssri‚Äôs or medications similar to those that effect the actual thought process of your brain. I‚Äôve just always had horrible experiences and didn‚Äôt wanna test my luck. She prescribed me propranolol and on day 1, unlike ssri‚Äôs, it began working. I still had the worries of the truck but my hands wouldn‚Äôt shake, it weirdly enough would take all my physical anxiety symptoms, like shaking, sweating, stomach dropping, etc, and put it into my feet. Like my feet would kinda tingle a little. But then i was able to just keep pushing along. When i got to work i felt totally fine, able to serve people with 0% shaky hands. Eventually due to the ‚Äúsafety‚Äù that the medication made me feel, i was able to drive happily and freely again and began to lose the memory of that horrible nightmare. \n\nOn a daily bases, it feels like a safety blanket i‚Äôm able to easily throw on. Even better is you can take it daily or as needed. Like i said, it only affects your body reactions from anxiety, so i do still have the occasional worry here and there about, well nothing but everything lol. But it‚Äôs just simply overall more manageable with this. Truly grateful this is an option now. ",

    "selftext": "A few weeks ago I realized that the majority of my anxiety begins with the physical feelings of it, and this spirals into more mental anxiety. I discovered Propranolol on this forum and decided to ask my doctor about it. After listening to what I've experienced and checking my heart rate / blood pressure, she determined I would be a good candidate, and she prescribed me 20mg tablets to use as needed. I took the first one yesterday at 4:30pm, and only took 10mg to just see how it felt. It honestly was great, and I noticed that upon thinking an anxious thought, my heart wouldn't get a sinking feeling like it normally does. Rather I didn't physically react at all, and just simply shrugged at the thought and let it pass. So it seems to have worked even at a smaller dosage, and I hope to continue to use it as needed, I truly think this can be a turning point with my anxiety / OCD and feel positive. \n\n  \nHowever, I did want to hear other people's experiences with side affects. I'd say about 4-5 hours after taking it my stomach was upset. I know this can be a side affect, but it is also possible I just ate something weird since I did go out for lunch earlier in the day. In doing my research about Propranolol, I did see some people share their bad experiences (heart rate dropping way too low in their sleep, hallucinations etc) so because of this I had trouble falling asleep since I was worrying this would happen to me. What was weird is around 1am when I was trying to sleep, I kept smelling camp fire smoke, and it would come and go every few minutes. I don't know if hallucinating smells is a side affect, or if maybe I was just anxious about having a side affect and that is what caused it.  I had a somewhat restless night because of this, but overall I don't think it's much of an issue with the drug, it's moreso me being anxious about taking it for the first time.\n\nAnyways, for the 4-6 hours it was in my system I can say it definelty worked for me, even at a small dosage. I am curious to try it again in a few days to see if I have some of the same issues with my stomach, but I am hoping that it was unrelated. ",

Afterwards, I travelled solo in Taiwan and the Philippines. \n\nI flew from the UK. I was so, SO excited. I made a rough itinerary for the first 2 weeks, had a loose plan for the remainder.

DP/DR does not work like a debt system e.g. the longer you are in DP/DR, the longer it is going to take you to get out of it (isn't true!). Everyone has the same chance of success in recovering from DP/DR, no matter how long or short you have been in that state.**\n**3. DP/DR is not indicative or a sign of psychosis, and you will not become psychotic if you experience DP/DR.**\n\n\nDP/DR is a **defense mechanism**, which attempts to make sure that only the body experiences pain or trauma and not the mind, by causing detachment. **Causes of DP/DR can be anxiety attacks, severe stress, health anxiety, drug induced (often from edibles or hallucinogens), traumatic first-hand or second-hand situations, abuse or any interpersonal trauma. Anyone of any age can experience DP/DR.**\n\n.......................................................................\n\n**What does DP/DR feel like?:**\n\n- Everything feels (and looks) either too close or too far away from you, environments are distorted\n- Everything feels flat or 2D, like it isn't quite real or tangible, others faces might feel unreal\n- Can feel like the world is slipping away from you\n- You might feel like you could fall over any second or fall through the floor\n- Speech can feel slow/slurred, like your brain is struggling to find words\n- Time can feel like its going too fast or too slow\n- Feeling like you can observe yourself outside your body, everything feels disconnected, like you are very alone\n- Your limbs can feel too small, too big, like you are taller or shorter than you actually are\n- You might feel internally dizzy (like your mind is spinning but your vision isn't), woozy head feelings, fuzzy head\n- More frequent feelings of nostalgia/dejavu\n- Colours can feel more dull or distorted\n- Feeling numb, like your memories are less tangible or unreal\n- Hypochondria (Healthy Anxiety) is often a huge comorbidity with DP/DR\n\n.......................................................................\n\n**The Feedback Loop, what is it?**\n\nSymptoms of DP/DR (as well as Anxiety/Health Anxiety) are often kept alive by or started something called the **Feedback Loop.** This is a loop that is constantly being fed into, which could have started from something as for example:\n\n*You may be minding your own business one day and suddenly experience a Panic Attack, but you misread it as being something worse. You could think you're about to die, that you are having a heart attack because of the palpitations, that you could collapse any moment now, and then it goes... but you're on edge, what if it happens again? Do I have a heart condition? I think I'm dying, I think something is wrong. Everyday you are waking up and checking if you can feel palpitations, you're scared it will happen again, you're getting waves of dread, your mind is full of 'what ifs' over and over again every single day. Then one day, nothing feels real and you feel completely detached from reality and this scares you even more, you feel like you're slipping away, you're terrified and feel like you'll never be normal again. You're waking up everyday to check if everything still feels unreal, and it does, its not going away. Whats happening?*\n\n\nThis is the **Feedback Loop** example which led to DP/DR or long-term anxiety symptoms. What should've happened when you experienced for example: a Panic Attack, was that **you should've been able to realise it was a Panic Attack and been able to ground yourself or calm down during that situation and it would go away. This would eliminate the start of the Feedback Loop**, but instead by misreading the situation or not having the appropriate tools to manage it, you are now in fear, in high stress and feeling traumatised of the situation in fear it will happen again or that something worse is happening to you. This keeps the Loop alive and going.\n\n**In preparation for the pain or fear you are about to anticipate happening, your body chose to disassociate from your mind and cause DP/DR in order to handle the stress and fear of what you're afraid of experiencing. DP/DR is attempting to save you from what could happen to you next, after being activated from something that already hurt you or traumatised you.**\n\nIdentifying the first source of your DP/DR can be particularly important in understanding and learning where your Feedback Loop started. **For some people it can even extend to as far as childhood, which can sometimes result in something known as DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder)**. Once you have identified the source, this is the stepping stone into recovering from DP/DR.\n\nSources of DPDR can be: drug-induced from hallucinogens/edibles/bad trips/alcohol or other substances, anxiety attacks, depression, stress, medical trauma/childhood trauma/adulthood trauma/being a child of divorce, sexual assaults/CSA, PTSD, DID and more\n\nEnvironments are also very important to be recognised as sources of DPDR e.g. stressful jobs, stressful/abusive relationships, difficult home life, being a full-time carer for family, difficult school life etc\n\n.......................................................................\n\n**So what's going to help me get better?**\n\nThere's a lot of resources and therapies available for DP/DR, such as Psychotherapy (talking therapies), CBT, DBT, EMDR and more.\n\nBut what is most important is that you are able to help yourself, as well as having professional support should you require it. **The thing that is going to get you better the most is you, and the tools you can develop to help you in time of need and in how you navigate the world and your trauma**. Some people (like me) may be able to recover from DP/DR without professional intervention or therapies, but it is always incredibly recommended if you have access or can afford it. **With DP/DR being highly trauma related, it is important to have a safe place to unload and traverse trauma with a professional**, as it can be tough to handle alone. **If you are concerned or suspect your DP/DR may be a result of DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder), professional help is absolutely necessary.**\n\nEvery person with DP/DR will be completely unique in their needs, what they can handle alone or what they need support with.\n\n.......................................................................\n\n**What can we do for ourselves?**\n\nThis is going to go over some self-practices and tools you can do in your own time to help yourself while actively experiencing DP/DR or long-term anxiety symptoms, and also how to reduce the chances of re-experiencing it when you are recovered.\n\n**Staying Busy & Challenging Yourself:**\n\nA big part of dissolving the Feedback Loop is by no longer feeding into it, and one way of doing this is by diverting our thoughts from the feelings of DP/DR or anxiety symptoms. **You want to find or make opportunities where you don't have time to think about DP/DR, or how it makes you feel, 'scanning' for feelings or signs of it, and to challenge those feelings instead.**\n**DP/DR and anxiety is the perfect time to get busy and involved with life**, whether it is your hobbies, being with your friends and family, doing chores that need to be done, starting things you've always wanted to do. **It can feel scary, even terrifying to partake in these things when you feel unreal, like you're not present or that the world is slipping away, but you must keep pushing through**. Once you begin to challenge yourself and challenge those feelings of 'not feeling real' you begin to establish trust within yourself.\n\n**Don't be disheartened that DP/DR or long-term anxiety symptoms do not disappear right away overnight, this is because your body hormonally, needs time to acclimate to low levels of stress and anxiety after having been kept at such high levels. If these hormones were to plummet immediately, the body wouldn't be able to cope, so it likes to decline it gently! So consider it like you are establishing trust:**\n\nDP/DR has been in the drivers seat all this time, and you've been the passenger in the back. You're finally insisting on being in the driver's seat, but DP/DR insists on being the passenger right next to you. DP/DR is going to freak out in the passenger seat and take the wheel from you at times during some tough situations because its not sure you can navigate it on your own, and instead of letting it take the driver's seat again you need to say to it, 'Don't worry. I've got this'. and DP/DR will let go of the wheel. This in real life, would be an example of you handling the situation you are in and challenging yourself to face what makes you afraid (such as going outside in case you feel 'unreal').\n\n**By doing this, you are establishing trust and are giving DP/DR the opportunity to know that you can handle the situation on your own. Eventually with time of practicing these things, DP/DR will get out of the car entirely and you can 'drive' all by yourself again and those feelings of DP/DR will be gone. You'll be able to live your life without things like anxiety or DP/DR dictacting where it takes you or how it makes you feel. You will have formed that trust that you can handle experiencing your pain, your fear, your trauma, your anxiety/stress etc. without the need of the defence mechanism of DP/DR. You will become the first line of defence!**\n\nFrom personal experience this is what accelerated me to my complete recovery from DP/DR and long-term anxiety symptoms within 3-4 months of this practice after struggling for almost a year of non-stop DP/DR and anxiety symptoms. **I learned to empathise with my DP/DR's attempt at trying to keep me safe and acknowledged that it was only doing this in order to make me feel better, albeit in a scary and inconvenient way! So by learning techniques and also teaching myself not to be scared of DP/DR symptoms or my anxiety symptoms, I gave myself the opportunity to be the one in control and say ''Hey, I am totally capable of caring for myself now. Thank you for your help and what you tried to do for me'' to my DP/DR.**\n\nBy feeling afraid to participate in activities or doing things because you might feel unreal, or because the world feels distorted, you are allowing DP/DR to maintain control and are keeping DP/DR as an option\n\n**Challenge yourself in incriments or in steps, and remember to reward yourself afterwards. Figure out what about DP/DR makes you afraid:**\n\n**is it seeing people's faces? particularly friends or family?** - challenge yourself towards looking at faces, engaging with familiar faces (YouTubers, family, partners), if you can touch their face then touch it, grounding exercises where you say ''I can see two eyes, they are [insert colour], they have a [description] nose, do they have freckles? birth marks? do they have any smile lines? identify parts of their face and describe them'' this helps make them more tangible and less scary. Do little challenges before the bigger ones.\n\n**is it going outside in case you feel unreal? woozy?** - challenge yourself towards small, short walks up and down your street, to eventually longer walks, acknowledge that you might be feeling dizzy/unreal but that you are safe, be kind & go home if you need it, try again another day, stay engaged with your hobbies/the outside world\n\n**is it the feeling that you'll never be the same again? that you think its permenant? that you've ruined your life?** - The first thing you'll see if you look up 'can dpdr be permenant' is 'no!' and every other article will say no. There has never been an observed case of DPDR being permenant, and you won't be the first case of that happening. Its really important you do not entertain or engage with people who believe it is permenant, or that theirs is permenant because they are just people who are keeping their own DPDR alive with the negativity. I recommend writing positive affirmations or reading them, and engaging with positive stories of DPDR recovery and sticking with facts. **You have not ruined your life, and you will recover.**\n**DPDR can make you feel afraid of lots of things, not just the ones I described above (but those are the most common).**\n\n**Grounding Exercises:**\nGrounding is a way to refocus and bring your attention back to the present and the world around you. This is can be used when experiencing fear or anxiety of your current DP/DR state, but is **most effective when you feel like it is 'coming on' or you are experiencing anxiety/stress that could lead to it.**\n\nGrounding exercises can involve:\n\n- Naming 5 things you can see, name 4 things you can touch and to touch them, naming 3 things you can hear and listening to them, what 2 things can you smell, 1 thing you can taste.\n- Holding ice cubes, putting your hands in cold water, picking up or touching things and explaining how it feels (is it cold, warm, does it feel rough or soft), identifying their colours deeply\n- Walks without music, tuning into the sounds of your steps, counting your steps, observing your surroundings on your walks, sitting in the grass and touching it.\n- Mental anchoring by saying (in your head or quietly to yourself) your full name, your age, where you live, what street you live on, the date, where you are, what you're doing. Repeat this gently until you feel calm.\n- Self-assurance phrases such as, ''You are okay'', ''Nothing can hurt me'', ''You will get through this'', ''I've done this once and I can do it again'' etc.\n\n.......................................................................\n\n**My Example of How I Personally Recovered from DPDR:**\n\nFor me I dealt with a lot of wooziness/dizziness during my DP/DR and I felt terrified to do anything sitting up or standing because I'd have to acknowledge that dizzy feeling and the unreal-ness from DP/DR, so I would lie on my side all day while watching TV or playing games instead to cope. **I wanted to turn 'Oh god, no I'm dizzy and woozy and nothing feels real, I'm so scared' into 'Oh I'm dizzy and feel unreal today? Lets see what I can manage'.**\n\nIt started to become more of 'Let's get up! Lets engage with the same hobbies but lets sit up this time'. I'd do that for as long as I feel I could handle the dizzines and unreal sensations, and then I'd lie back down again. I rewarded myself and cared for myself with a technique that brought me comfort, while having succeeded in engaging with something that scared me or was difficult. Over time I'd start to sit up for longer, or I'd start to go outside on short walks (which was particularly hard as I'd feel more unreal outside than at home), and I would feel unreal, like everything was flat, like the world was slipping away but I did it.\n\nSome days I would just cry or feel like I took steps back, that I'd be stuck forever but I kept going and I kept rewarding myself after those times with either little lie downs, eating things I really loved, engaging in self-care or watching familiar TV shows I know I loved. Over time I started to sit up a lot more, I started to stand more, I started to go out more and for much, much longer each time, I started to do all the things I loved again despite how I felt. **Don't get me wrong, I still felt unreal and dizzy but I wanted to stop being scared of it and to not let it stop me engaging with things I loved or wanted to do.**\n\n**I stopped basing my days and thoughts on 'how good I'm feeling' and more so on 'how well can I manage today'.** That took away a lot of pressure for me, as I knew I would not feel better over night but I would learn to manage my days better, so focusing on that intrinsically helped me feel better. You'll want to learn how to manage bad days (whether DPDR days, anxious days, stressful days) because when you do, you'll become prepared for if you ever face any of those times again and you can conquer it!\n\nOne day after months of challenging myself, being more present, doing my hobbies, going outside (I remember this vividly) I was hugging my partner and I looked up at his face and I physically jumped, **he looked real. I started looking around everywhere and everything felt real, everything looked so colorful, the world didn't feel flat or distorted, everything felt 'real' and 'right' and when I touched my partner's face it felt so tangible and real.** I don't think I've ever cried that hard in my life from happiness, my DPDR was gone.\n\nEverything probably felt like this for a while, but because I was so engrossed in engaging with the world around me and doing the things I loved I didn't actually realise it, because I was no longer questioning my reality or looking for signs of DP/DR. **So that one moment where I finally remembered to 'check' my reality, it made me realise everything felt real again and that I felt human again. And it never came back.**\n\nWhen you feel ready, the key is to be kind to yourself as well as challenge yourself against your DPDR and how it makes you feel. By pushing through and engaging with the world around you bit by bit you will start to establish that trust, those tools, in convincing your body that you can handle yourself and that it no longer needs to detach with DPDR to keep you safe.\n\n.......................................................................\n\n**Some habits to get into, and some to get rid of:**\n\n- **Cut out all alcohol and all drugs absolutely and completely, as well as caffeine & reduce or quit smoking.** All of these substances will have an effect on the hormones in your body, and can impede progress from DP/DR due to the sensations it can produce and will generally stress out the body, and mind-altering drugs like hallucinogens or Cannabis can worsen DP/DR greatly or keep it around. *If you are an addict or suffer from addictions, get in touch with services that can help you taper, detox or navigate potential sobriety, do not attempt any of this alone.*\n\n- **Establish a normal bedtime routine**, ideally getting into bed at 9-10pm and waking up before 9am. Some people need more sleep than others so wake up at whatever time in the morning before 9am is best for you; getting adequate sleep will greatly improve the rate of which your DP/DR can dissolve as your mind will be most lucid, alert and prepared to handle potential stressors. **Sleeping too much or too little can greatly affect your brain and hormone regulation, and you need the best hormone regulation in order for the body to lower cortisol levels which leads to DP/DR symptoms rapidly improving.**\n\n- **Stay hydrated and well-fed.** This is really typical mental health advice, but in general you will want to make sure you are hydrated and well-fed so the body has enough energy supply to handle stressors, anxiety and to ensure the mind is as lucid and energised as possible. You will need all the energy you can possibly get, and having these bases covered can really improve your symptoms.\n\n- **Get checked for any Vitamin Deficiencies** as a lot of Vitamins we can be deficient in will greatly effect circadian rhythms, heart rhythms, the brain (deficiencies can cause brain fog, low motor skill function and poor hormone regulation). **Making sure we have healthy, functioning foundations to work off of greatly supports mental function and our ability to take on new information and learn new things (such as therapeutic tools and treatment).**\n\n- **Identify your stressors and reduce them, identify your triggers and navigate them.** Cortisol levels increase with stress (from stressors) and anxiety, when we are faced with high levels of cortisol for extended periods of time, the body can produce bizzare and scary symptoms (which are harmless). \n.......................................................................\n\nPlease feel free to ask me any questions if you have any!

Car was clean as well!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAbout 20 minutes into our drive I notice he's sort of glancing in the rearview at me like he wants to say something, he starts kind of breathing deep breaths and says: \"Sorry I have to pull over.\" I reply: \"Ok is everything alright?.\" He says \"Sorry having a panic attack.\"\n\nI remained calm and told him, \"Ok that's fine man, I have panic attacks too, I'm not going anywhere important, take your time.\"\n\nLuckily he was able to pullover, we were in a residential area with a hill next to us and side walk.\n\nHe wasn't really speaking much at this point and I told him: \"I know when I have these attacks I like to be alone, don't worry I'm not in a hurry, I'll be over here on the curb playing games on my phone take your time, let me know if you want to call anyone.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAbout 20-30 minutes later, I told him I could drive him the rest of the way so he could finish his trip and make money, he said to give him a few more minutes. He was able to calm down enough to drive us. We arrived fine, I tipped him told him this is my number if he needs to talk with someone with anxiety as well and went on our ways. I think fresh air and giving him space helped him instead of worrying about finishing his trip with me. Anyways just a small story I had today. Cheers",

My therapist seems really nice and her little room was the perfect environment for me to feel comfortable talking.\n\nAt the end she asked me what I wanted from therapy. As I was telling her all about me and my life, I was constantly worried about her thinking I was overreacting, judging my stories or thinking them not serious enough to require therapy and that I was just a weak person. She looked at my blankly and said ‚Äòis it a big deal for you?‚Äô I said, ‚Äòyes, massively‚Äô and she just simply replied ‚Äòwell then it‚Äôs a big deal...‚Äô, and just shrugged her shoulders and started talking about our next session.\n\nHonestly it was like an epiphany. I realised that if something is a big deal in MY universe, then it is a big deal because it‚Äôs me that matters and someone else not thinking it‚Äôs serious does NOT invalidate that. I‚Äôm always so anxious that my problems will seem silly to someone else, but actually if they really care about helping you get through it, they won‚Äôt judge the nature of the problem but try and help you through it anyway because they know it‚Äôs a serious problem to you. Your problems are all valid and they‚Äôre all worth fixing guys, don‚Äôt ever forget that xx",

It was my time to go, I had cars behind me, I paid and I just couldn't do it. So I got out of my car and asked the car behind me if I they could back up and let me leave as I was having a panic attack and that they could have my paid car wash is they wanted. Turns out it was a mother and her teenage son and immediately this mom is like \"would you like me to go in the car wash with you if that would make you feel better?\" and as I was holding up the line I said sure and so she had her son drive her car and she hopped in my tiny two seater miata, and just sat and talked to me while I drove through the car wash. We just talked about Christmas and she was telling me how she had to sell her house and how her son liked my car and I'm just sitting there shaking like a leaf. And soon enough the car wash was over, we survived, my car didn't break down, and I dropped her back off with her son.\n\nOne of the most wholesome experiences of my life. \n\nIm going to try to find her on my towns Facebook page, try and give her some grocery and car wash money for the trouble.

I was shaking so hard at this point and almost chickened out. \n\nBarely getting my key in the door to unlock my deadbolt as I was shaking so much, I forced myself to walk outside to him with the blanket and hot water bottle. I apologised for disturbing him, and simply said he must be freezing and to keep both items. He told me I was a gem, and thanked me.\n\nIm back inside my apartment now, feeling like I'm about to faint from the adrenalin and starting to cry from the stress of the situation, but I am so proud of myself.

I don‚Äôt always feel like answering at the moment so I‚Äôll put it off, but then I get very anxious knowing the reply is waiting for me, and I ignore it, and it makes me more anxious thinking the person is getting angry at me, and it‚Äôs a very vicious cycle. \n\nThe only time I don‚Äôt feel this way is when I‚Äôm either very busy working (and then I use the messages as a welcome distraction) or when I take Adderall for ADHD, because then I feel very assertive and have no fear. \n\nI think the lock down has made things worse because now I don‚Äôt go to the gym (usual fear release) and there‚Äôs no social time to replenish my mind in preparation for online messages, since they take a lot of mental effort. \n\nI‚Äôm curious to see if anyone else experiences this, and hopefully I won‚Äôt avoid your replies üòÜ\n\n=========\n\nEdit: Lmao this post blew up, and now I have 40+ replies to read. The irony is astounding! But I am to hear everyone else‚Äôs experiences too. \n\nI was thinking more and part of it may be due to the fact that each online message represents another demand on our time and another decision we must make. At least that‚Äôs part of the issue. And diverts from our energy when already in an inert place.\n\nTake care of yourselves, everyone >< Gonna go take a relaxing bath after reading the replies here",

    "selftext": "Yes we can say \"oh stop blaming your parents\" but the truth is, the reason why most are struggling with anxiety is because you had guardians who didn't do a good job of making you confident about yourself. Yes you can say its \"genetics\" but even then, nurture can either make the condition better or worse. You are raised with these people your whole life, the people that surround you growing up effect you whether you like to admit it or not. Maybe your anxious all the time because your parents would throw temper tantrums every time you made mistakes and that manifested later on in to your adulthood, maybe your anxious because you had Authoritarian parents that didn't allow you to grow socially, maybe you are genetically prone to being more anxious and the people you were raised with only enhanced that feeling etc.\n\nAll I'm saying is, it's so underrated how much parents can affect there children growing up. It can make life alot more difficult than it should be if your not raised with the right people. \n\nTo adults who are going through anxiety, yes its tougher for us but take it one step at a time. Don't compare yourself to others because they didn't live your life. They didn't face the troubles that you did, every small step you take is progress. I have a toxic family who doesn't see any of my small achievements but to me it's big. The past affects your present but it's about how you deal with it that matters. One step at a time and soon you'll be able to overcome it.",

    "title": "How I Beat my Anxiety Disorder and Advice on How to do so Yourself",
    "selftext": "So if you‚Äôre reading this and currently in the midst of an anxiety disorder, let me start by saying I know how you feel. I‚Äôve had panic attacks where the adrenaline rushes just don‚Äôt stop, I‚Äôve been nauseated and unable to eat or drink for days on end, I‚Äôve felt so short of breath it was like drowning above water, had the jitters and the lump in my throat. I‚Äôve also had all of the uncomfortable mental symptoms. I‚Äôve dissociated for almost a full day multiple times, I‚Äôve had racing, intrusive thoughts that lasted weeks and sometimes months at a time. And I‚Äôve felt like I was going crazy. A lot.\n\nBut I‚Äôm here to tell you my struggle with my anxiety disorder is over. After almost a year of conscious and concerted effort, all of the worst symptoms of my anxiety are completely gone. Some of the more mild ones still appear from time to time; I‚Äôll get fatigued or dizzy/foggy maybe once every few weeks, but this happens so infrequently (and becomes less frequent with each occurrence) that it doesn‚Äôt really bug me. I was also on medication (an SSRI since day one and a benzo for the first few months) and am in the process of tapering off .\n\nSo I wanted to write a post about how to get over each stage of your anxiety, mainly because I know I really would have appreciated this kind of guidance when I first sought help in late April of last year. If you want a summary of things you can do regardless of what stage you‚Äôre at, scroll to the bottom and check the paragraph in bold.\n\nI don‚Äôt discuss responses to specific symptoms here, just a general approach. If you‚Äôre looking for tactics for specific symptoms, check out the list of books I left in the second section. I think the first one does a particularly good job of addressing every symptom, but you can try the third if you don‚Äôt feel it makes enough of a difference.\n\nBefore you read, I want to mention something once so I don‚Äôt have to later on. Recovery is going to be like a rollercoaster. Some days you‚Äôll feel like you made incredible progress, and others you‚Äôll have difficulty even doing simple tasks. It‚Äôs going to be a lot of two steps forward, one step back. Sometimes it‚Äôll even be two steps forward, two steps back. But even those times are okay, because they serve as proof that you are capable of improving. Just know that once you start to give effort, things will start gradually getting better.\n\nSo here it is. My comprehensive guide to recovering from an anxiety disorder.\n\nIf you‚Äôre at a constant 9/10 - 10/10 anxiety and can‚Äôt calm down:\n\nAt this stage, you‚Äôre either in the middle of panic attack (which lasts up to 60 minutes) or you have GAD and are constantly anxious. I was diagnosed with GAD and Pure-O but I‚Äôve had maaaaaany panic attacks, so I know this advice will work for both.\n\n**1.** Stop trying to fight your anxiety symptoms. Understand that the best thing you can do for your body right now is just let it run its course. This is the basis of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) which is one of the types of therapy currently used to treat anxiety disorders. To do this:\n\n* Don‚Äôt try to stop any symptoms you are experiencing. This is infinitely easier said than done at first, but with practice you‚Äôll be able to pick this up fairly quickly. When I was first having constant adrenaline rushes, I kept trying to consciously stop them. This was actually making things worse. The more you try to fight your symptoms, the more worried you become, which in turn causes your system to release more of the stress-causing hormones, causing your symptoms to become worse. The best thing you can do at this point is wait it out and let your body tire itself out. \n\n* Questions, doubts, and fear will come up. When they do, remind yourself that this is a totally normal process that your body is going through, and try to rest in the anxiety. It may be difficult, but try to ease into the symptoms. This was initially what helped my adrenaline rushes decrease in severity and frequency.\n\n* If this isn‚Äôt working and you find your symptoms are still persisting and won‚Äôt stop, ask for more. As the DARE Response (discussed later) puts it, run towards your symptoms. If you‚Äôve ever read a book on ACT, this step is likely in there. When you ask your body to make your symptoms worse, you‚Äôll find it can‚Äôt. The symptoms of anxiety are driven by a subconscious worry, and not something you can control. Keep running towards it until your symptoms gradually begin to ease, then move on to step 2. In case you‚Äôre interested, the clinical term for this is ‚Äúarousal reappraisal.‚Äù It‚Äôs not discussed very often, but I found it to be very helpful. \n\n**2.** Do anything you possibly can to get your mind off of the anxiety. In older forms of anxiety treatment, this kind of thing was referred to as a distraction tactic, but in The DARE Response, Barry McDonagh calls it being ‚Äúengaged.‚Äù This basically means do whatever you can to focus your mind on something other than your anxiety. Regardless of what level of anxiety you‚Äôre at, this is incredibly important. **Your anxiety is most easily fueled when you focus on it, so do whatever you can to move your attention to something else.** Again, MUCH easier said than done, and your mind will fight you at every stage. But it‚Äôs an integral part of recovery. When I first started out, I found short activities the most helpful, like picking up my guitar/cajon and playing a song or two, or doing homework. \n\n**3.** Give it time. Your system can‚Äôt sustain anxiety levels this high for an extended period of time unless you consciously fuel it. If you are properly easing into your symptoms and engaging yourself in other activities you‚Äôll eventually calm down to the next phase of anxiety recovery.\n\n**4.** If recommended by your physician, a benzo might help. Benzos are basically nervous system relaxants, but they‚Äôre no magic pill. When I took my first dose of valium, I didn‚Äôt feel a thing. It took a few days of constant dosing to see any effect. Benzos are fine to use in the very beginning, but I will issue a warning about them: try to use them as sparingly as possible. Benzos are not meant to be used in the long term, and if the first thing you do when feeling anxious is reach for your benzo, you‚Äôll have real difficulty recovering in the later stages. But since at this point, you‚Äôre in a constant state of panic, they‚Äôre a great way to ease you down to the next lowest stage of anxiety, so you can start focusing on the long term.\n\n**5.** Journal. I don‚Äôt recommend this as much beyond this stage, as I‚Äôve found it doesn‚Äôt really help all that much. But in the beginning stages of my experience with GAD, I found journaling to be an indispensable asset to really figure out what I was going through. Just write out whatever you‚Äôre thinking or feeling. It‚Äôs a great what to get out of your head for at least a little bit.\n\n**6.** Get up and do something to release all your pent up adrenaline. Walk around the block, take a stretch break at work. You don‚Äôt need to be doing a full workout at this point, just something to help you use the jitters and adrenaline you‚Äôre getting for something productive.\n\n**7.** This one may seem rather minor, but it helped me a lot in the beginning: fix your posture. It‚Äôs much easier to feel short of breath when you‚Äôre in a position that doesn‚Äôt let you breath easily. If you‚Äôre lying down, lay on your back. If you‚Äôre sitting, sit up straight.\n\nOnce you‚Äôve thoroughly calmed down from this point (this took me about three or four weeks), you can move on to the next step.\n\nConstant 6 - 8/10 with occasional panic attacks:\n\nIf you‚Äôre at this phase, you are probably still experiencing physical manifestations of your anxiety, like jitters, nausea, jelly legs, shortness of breath, and so on. But you‚Äôre not in constant freakout mode anymore. You can make logical decisions aimed more at long term recovery because rather than being focused on your anxiety 100% of the time, you pay attention to it 80 - 90% of the time. You may be leaving the house occasionally but your symptoms are still bad enough that they keep you at home most of the time. So here‚Äôs what to do at this stage:\n\n**1. Start reading or listening to books on what you‚Äôre going through**. The more you understand the subtleties of what‚Äôs going on in your brain and body, the better you‚Äôll be able fix them. Read up on therapy techniques as they‚Äôll be your quickest route to recovery. In the end, this ended up being the single most helpful thing for my recovery. When you‚Äôre knowledgeable of exactly what is at your disposal, you can try everything and see what works best for you. In fact, I found really helpful ideas in books that none of my therapists had even heard of. Like your anxiety, the list of books that will be the most helpful for you is very personalized, but here are my recommendations (all of these books are available on Audible, which is how I consumed them):\n\n* The DARE Response. Phenomenal book written by someone who‚Äôs been through the worst parts of anxiety and paved his own path to recovery. His techniques are a combination between ACT and a little CBT. I would especially recommend this book if you‚Äôre at the higher end of the anxiety scale.\n\n* Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy. This book is considered the gold standard of CBT. It‚Äôs aimed at treating depression, but (as the author notes) it works for anxiety as well. I listened to the whole thing, then picked out the chapters I thought applied to me. It‚Äôs long, so I don‚Äôt think you need to do the first part, but there‚Äôs a lot of valuable information in this book that a lot of other books skim over.\n\n* Rewire Your Anxious Brain. This one is 1/4 CBT, 1/4 lifestyle guidance, and half about the neuroscience behind anxiety. I like this one a lot because it gets into some of the mechanics of why we feel the way we do, and why therapy and lifestyle changes are so impactful.\n\n* The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck. This one has been mentioned on this subreddit several times before, and I really like it. It serves as a great reminder of why some things in life just aren‚Äôt worth giving a fuck about. Fair warning: Mark Manson describes OCD as ‚Äúan incurable disease‚Äù in this book. He‚Äôs not a doctor or therapist and isn‚Äôt really knowledgeable on the subject, so I‚Äôd take that section with a grain of salt. But the message he drives home at the end is really good regardless.\nRemember, the point of these books isn‚Äôt to give you step by step instructions on how to get better. Rather they are there to give you ideas on how to best help yourself.\n\n**2.** Get into therapy. This is perhaps the second most important things you can do for yourself behind reading. Therapy is the first line of treatment for anxiety, and for good reason. Once you find a therapist who you work well with, you‚Äôll notice you progress much more quickly. Some things to look out for when you screen your therapist:\n\n* Are they nice? Kind of an obvious one but worth going over. Do you feel like they take what you‚Äôre saying seriously? Are their answers usually thoughtful and caring?\n\n* Are they experienced? My first therapist was tremendously nice and caring, but he didn‚Äôt know much about anxiety treatment beyond the very basics, like square breathing. \n\n* Are they accessible? Or do you have to drive two hours to see them? Are they available for weekly sessions or can you only see them once a month?\nIt may take a while until you find a therapist who‚Äôs right for you, but this is a person you‚Äôll be meeting with multiple times a month for several months/years. I would advise giving your therapist at least three or four sessions before you consider switching to a new one. \n\n**3.** Continue with all the acceptance techniques outlined in the previous section. These are things that I remind myself of even now. The more open you are towards your anxiety symptoms, the more quickly they‚Äôll dissipate. In addition, if you can, start easing off your benzo a little bit. If you‚Äôre taking it three times a day, try to move down to two. If you‚Äôre down to two a day, try one.\n\n**4.** Start making some lifestyle changes that are proven to help with anxiety in the long term:\n\n* Cardiovascular exercise. It‚Äôs said that exercise is one of the most positive things to improve mood when you‚Äôre anxious, but I‚Äôd like to look at it from the opposite perspective. When you‚Äôre anxious, your body is filled with excess adrenaline that keeps building up. If you don‚Äôt dump it out somehow, the symptoms will inevitably get worse. So getting up from your desk or your bed is one of the most effective things you can do to help yourself in the long term. If you‚Äôre not super exercise savvy, my suggestion is to get out and walk, jogging occasionally. Walking is great for releasing excess energy, but you can boost the speed at which you let off adrenaline by running. You don‚Äôt need to do sprints whenever you run, but you‚Äôll get the most out of your exercise if you really challenge yourself each time. More on this later.\n\n* Meditation. The reason so many people say this is so good for anxiety is because it helps you better come to terms with your symptoms. It also lets you really hone in on some of the less productive thought processes you‚Äôre having so you can learn to catch and correct them. Keep in mind, the purpose of meditation is not to clear your mind and think of nothing. In fact, it‚Äôs almost the opposite. While meditating, your job is to let your body and brain work as normal and merely try to act as a conscious observer of all your thoughts and feelings. A really popular visualization technique for this is thinking of your thoughts as clouds, and you‚Äôre just watching them pass by. There is plenty of information out there on how to meditate, and it includes helpful techniques like noting, so I won‚Äôt go into it that much here. Make sure that your approach to meditation is similar to your approach to exercise: slowly ease into it by doing it for short periods at first, then working up very gradually to longer periods after every couple sessions. I suggest trying out the meditation app Calm.\n\n* Diet. If you‚Äôre reading this, you‚Äôve probably read the do‚Äôs and don‚Äôts of your diet about a hundred times, but I‚Äôll reiterate quickly here: no caffeine, no alcohol. Try your best to avoid excessive sweets and fried foods, and those are shown [1] to worsen your mood in the long term. One of the less known changes you can make to your diet is to include more natural sources of magnesium. It is speculated [2] that magnesium plays a part in anxiety regulation, though the research isn‚Äôt entirely there yet. Regardless, try to include dark leafy greens like spinach and whole grains like brown rice into your diet to hit this as a staple. You can also take a magnesium supplement (I‚Äôll defer to the DARE Response for information about it), though again, research is shaky so this alone won‚Äôt bring change. \n\n* Medication. This one will be completely at you/your doctor‚Äôs discretion. Some people respond well to antidepressants, some don‚Äôt. I didn‚Äôt feel like they helped me all that much, but you might. Note, the purpose of antidepressants isn‚Äôt to make you happy or to gradually cure your anxiety. Research shows [3] that antidepressants are useful for supplementing long term change in the brain. This is a REALLY important thing to note because it means that antidepressants won‚Äôt change anything on their own. Only if you give conscious effort will you be able to see positive change. Medication only makes it happen more quickly.\n\n**5.** Give it time. Your nervous system doesn‚Äôt change overnight. It may need a week or two more before you achieve the results you want. So just keep practicing your therapy techniques and doing everything you know works and push through.\n\nOnce you‚Äôve been at these things for a while, you‚Äôll notice your anxiety start to decrease to the next phase.\n\nHovering around 4 - 6:\n\nIf you‚Äôre at this stage, congratulations! The first two stages are really hard to break out of, and if you did, it likely took a tremendous amount of effort. So give yourself a pat on the back. Once you‚Äôve reached this stage, your anxiety likely doesn‚Äôt manifest itself physically as much. You may still get nauseated occasionally, but most of the time you‚Äôre able to eat and drink and (hopefully) sleep through the night. You‚Äôve started reclaiming your normal life. You get out of the house relatively frequently and do things like run errands. But you‚Äôre still really anxious whenever you go out. In addition, though your physical symptoms may have eased up, your mental symptoms may still be incredibly difficult to deal with. So here‚Äôs what you should do at this stage:\n\n**1.** Keep staying the course. It‚Äôs easy to flounder or stop, and it‚Äôs okay if you do. But remember to pick up right where you left off. Also, don‚Äôt beat yourself up for making mistakes. Everyone falters from time to time, it‚Äôs part of what makes us human. And it‚Äôs okay if things are taking longer than you expected. Take it from me that if you keep looking for ways you can improve your anxiety and practicing the techniques you know work, things will get better.\n\n**2.** Keep pushing the envelope. Identify areas of your life that you‚Äôve always been anxious about and challenge yourself to use therapy techniques to improve them. I used to beat myself up for being awkward ever since I was a little kid. I‚Äôd find flaws in every interaction I had with others and nitpick every little thing. Once I started working on this, I noticed not only an improvement in these kinds of situations, but also an improvement in my overall anxiety. This is part of how Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) therapy works. You expose yourself to situations that make your anxiety flare up, and use CBT techniques to curb your conscious worry. An important note about this is **these experiences aren‚Äôt meant to be fun**. If you‚Äôve got social anxiety and you‚Äôre challenging yourself by going to meet new people, it‚Äôll likely be an uncomfortable experience the first few times. People around you may be having plenty of fun while you keep worrying and criticizing yourself. But you‚Äôll slowly notice improvement, and with time, it‚Äôll become more and more natural over time.\n\n**3.** Along the same lines, start making your workouts more difficult. Run/bike/swim for longer, lift heavier weights. When you‚Äôre anxious, you tend to stagnate in certain areas of your life, sometimes without realizing it. The only way to get better is to keep pushing the bounds of what you do. I saw a post on this subreddit a while ago along the lines of ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been lightly jogging for 25 minutes a day for the last month or two, why aren‚Äôt I seeing my anxiety improve?‚Äù And the answer in this case is because this person wasn‚Äôt pushing him/herself. If you continue to do the same things, you shouldn‚Äôt expect to see improvement.\n\n**4.** Start identifying and cutting off some of your crutches/unhealthy habits. For a lot of us (me included), this comes in the form of googling symptoms or constantly asking for help on this subreddit. It‚Äôs okay to cave every once in a while at this stage, but you need to consciously stop yourself from constantly asking for help on the internet. One of the things this does is keep you focused on your anxiety, which is exactly what engaging yourself is meant to prevent. I stopped browsing this subreddit for almost a half year, and my condition got much better as a result. If you‚Äôre seriously concerned about something, visit your doctor/psychiatrist/therapist and ask them, but once they diagnose you, do not second guess it. I spent my entire college career going to different doctors (I think at least 10 or 11 different types, sometimes multiple doctors of each kind). I was convinced there was something wrong with me that no one could find, but the true culprit was anxiety. If you **feel** like you‚Äôre constantly sick or dying, yet doctors can‚Äôt find anything wrong, this is a clue that you have an issue with being a hypochondriac. You can go about fixing this the way you did in all areas of your therapy (I personally used the CBT method outlined in Feeling Good), but the important thing is to recognize that just because your brain is telling you something doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs true. \n\n**5.** Give it time. I‚Äôve said it before but it‚Äôs important to reiterate. Recovering from this stage might take several months, so try your best to be patient. And remember, if things aren‚Äôt the way you want them to be now, they will be soon.\n\nI think it‚Äôs also important to discuss the idea of **cognitive fusion**, which you may have come across in your book reading, as I think understanding it will be really helpful. Google defines cognitive fusion as attaching a thought to an experience, but since that‚Äôs kind of vague, I‚Äôll give my own definition. Cognitive fusion is when you take what your thoughts tell you as fact. In other words, you‚Äôre using your thoughts to draw irrational conclusions about the world around you. One example of this is if you‚Äôre someone who criticizes themselves too much. You might tell yourself ‚Äúthat conversation was so awkward, so that person must think I‚Äôm a loser.‚Äù In this case, whether or not the situation was awkward, you don‚Äôt know what the other person is thinking. I used to think this a lot until I realized people really didn‚Äôt see me that way, and all the worrying I did was for nothing. A healthy level of questioning can do lots to help you overcome your anxiety.\n\nAt this stage, I had the most trouble with mental symptoms, namely the feeling of going crazy. I thought the little floaters in my eyes were hallucinations, I always second guessed my own sanity, I thought the weird dreams or intrusive thoughts I was having were a sign of schizophrenia, and anytime I was happy, I thought it was a sign of bipolar disorder. This is another great example of cognitive fusion that took me a while to get over: I thought I was going crazy, so to me that was evidence that I really was. If you think this describes you, it might do you well to get into the habit of questioning your thoughts as well. Is it more logical that your psychiatrist, therapists, family, and friends are correct when they say you‚Äôre not crazy and are just experiencing symptoms of anxiety, or that you‚Äôre the one person out of the fifty who‚Äôs somehow figured out you‚Äôre losing it? This applies to basically every anxious situation you may encounter. Remember: **just because you think something doesn‚Äôt make it true**.\n\nOne of the things that took me a long time to realize was that my constant worry over these things was caused by the fact that I was paying so much attention to them. At this point in recovery, it‚Äôs absolutely **imperative that you keep yourself occupied, especially when you‚Äôre most anxious**. I found that doing things like cooking and cleaning were ways to keep my mind off my anxiety without having to think about it. I suggest doing the same, as they‚Äôre both productive and beneficial in the end. Eventually, your mind will calm down on its own and you‚Äôll find your own solutions to these symptoms. I find that at this point the really important thing really is time. Once I felt like I was going crazy for the hundredth time, I realized that if every time before this one was a false alarm, this one (and all the ones after for that matter) are false alarms too. This stage took about 3 months to recover from, but once I did, I hit the next stage.\n\nAnxiety is 1 - 3 most days, with some days feeling almost completely anxiety free:\n\nYou‚Äôre in the home stretch. This is it. You‚Äôre likely already giving yourself credit for all the hard work you‚Äôve done, but you should still take a moment to recognize just how far you‚Äôve come. For me, having a day where I go out and try something new with friends while anxious is something I wouldn't have been able to do even BEFORE my anxiety disorder. Certainly not anything I‚Äôd ever dreamed of while in the thick of it. Seriously, if you‚Äôve hit this point, the light should be at the end of the tunnel. And on the days where it‚Äôs a little harder to deal with, let me reassure you: you‚Äôre almost home free.\n\nNote: your symptoms will still be present at this point. Some of the intrusive thoughts might still come, sometimes you‚Äôll have a bit of dissociation or an occasional almost-panic attack, but you know how to deal with these things. Your moments of panic don‚Äôt last more than a few seconds, and your symptoms don‚Äôt really illicit a response from you. At this stage:\n\n**1.** You know what works best for you. Keep doing it. You have your techniques and you‚Äôve clearly demonstrated they work. All that‚Äôs left is to keep doing them and reap the rewards you know will come. On the worse days when your anxiety peaks at a 3 or 4, remind yourself where you were several months ago and how you‚Äôll never experience anxiety that bad ever again. Then gently engage yourself in something and ride the wave of anxiety until it subsides. \n\n**2.** Slowly lose your crutches. If you discuss your anxiety with your friends, stop doing so as frequently and eventually stop altogether. If you‚Äôre still occasionally taking benzos, slowly taper off. The more of your independence you get back, the more confident you‚Äôll feel.\n\n**3.** Keep exploring other areas of your life where you‚Äôve had anxiety and use what you‚Äôve learned to stop worrying. For me, this meant things like conquering my fear of heights by going snowboarding, and confronting my discomfort with physical and emotional intimacy by going out of my way to discuss these things. The more of these long-standing anxieties you‚Äôre able to ease, the better you‚Äôll feel overall. Plus you get the added sense of achievement for doing things that past you would‚Äôve never been able to do.\n\nThere really isn‚Äôt much left to say at this stage. I found myself being discouraged more frequently at this point just because I knew I was so close to the finish line but not quite there. In case you need any encouragement, remind yourself of how well you‚Äôve done so far and that there‚Äôs more to come.\n\nThen finally‚Ä¶\n\nNo anxiety, with the worst days peaking at a 0.5 or 1:\n\nThat‚Äôs it. All the voices in your head telling you you‚Äôre not good enough have gone silent. All those symptoms you used to worry so much about don‚Äôt really happen anymore. You might still be a bit fatigued or foggy some days, but most of the time you‚Äôre energetic, present, and can confront new challenges with a sense of confidence you‚Äôve never had. It‚Äôs been a few months since you‚Äôve even given your anxiety a second thought. You know some of your symptoms might come back for a short spell every once in a while, but you‚Äôre not worried about them. You know exactly what to do when that happens, and that they‚Äôll go away just as quickly as they came.\n\nI don‚Äôt have any advice for this point. You know what got you here and have built up the mental fortitude to know you‚Äôll keep on doing it. \n\nCongratulations. You understand how amazing it is that you got to this point. Remember this feeling.\n_\n\nMy therapist once gave me a great rule of thumb I think sums things up really well: whatever your anxiety is telling you to do, do the opposite. If it‚Äôs telling you not to get out of bed, do it. If it‚Äôs telling you not to go to a social event, do that. If it‚Äôs telling you you‚Äôre going to suffer from some grave illness, remind yourself that‚Äôs not true. If it‚Äôs telling you to google your symptoms or ask for help, don‚Äôt. If it‚Äôs telling you you‚Äôre losing your mind, remind yourself you‚Äôre not. Give it enough time, and eventually things will get better. \n\n**Summary:**\n\n**Ease into your symptoms. Remember that it‚Äôs just anxiety and can‚Äôt do anything other than make you uncomfortable. You‚Äôve been through this a hundred times before and survived every single time.**\n\n**Don‚Äôt fight it. When you fight your anxiety, it only gets worse. So let your anxiety do whatever it wants and just watch as a detached observer.**\n\n**Keep yourself occupied. The more time you spend thinking about your anxiety, googling your symptoms, posting on this subreddit, writing in your journal, or just stewing in general, the worse off you‚Äôll be. Cook, clean, dance, exercise, paint, draw, do anything you can to forcibly rip your mind off your anxiety.**\n\n**Keep pushing the bounds of what you‚Äôre doing. Expose yourself to more anxiety. Exercise harder. Try things you‚Äôve never tried before. Make your anxiety flare up as much as possible because you know it‚Äôll only benefit you in the end.**\n\n**Regularly question your thoughts. Just because you think something doesn‚Äôt make it true. You‚Äôll find a hundred times out of a hundred the thing you‚Äôve been dreading isn‚Äôt half as horrible as your brain has made it out to be.**\n\n**Give it time. You‚Äôll find once you experience the same anxiety for the same reason for the thousandth time in a row that it becomes a bit easier to stop believing what it tells you.**\n\nThank you for reading this. I really hope that, no matter where you‚Äôre at in life, you gained something from this. Please let me know what parts of this were the most helpful, or if there‚Äôs anything you want me to expand upon. I‚Äôll try to respond to comments as best I can, but I work full time and don‚Äôt log into this account all that much, so I‚Äôm sorry if I don‚Äôt get to your comment as quickly as you‚Äôd like.\n\nSources:\n\n1. https://www.everydayhealth.com/news/ways-food-affects-your-mood/\n2. https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/evolutionary-psychiatry/201106/magnesium-and-the-brain-the-original-chill-pill\n3.

I've read all of your comments and am super happy ya'll found this helpful. I want to remind all of you who are currently going through bouts of anxiety that you absolutely will make it through and that you'll be a much better person for it. \n\nKeep in mind: anxiety does not define you. An anxiety disorder is not a permanent condition. Much like any other illness or disorder, you can take gradual steps to recover. It may not come as quickly as you want and you will encounter plenty of pitfalls. But once you start counting your victories, however small, you'll realize what a **huge** difference your efforts can make.\n\nGood luck guys :)\n\nEdit 3: Tossed another David Burns book (author of Feeling Good), **When Panic Attacks**, up in the book list. Thanks u/PM10inPAYPAL4LULZ. Also fixed some formatting issues.\n\nEdit 4: Thanks again for all the support everyone. I'm glad people are still managing to find this post even though it was written almost a half year ago. I tossed a book recommended by u/andrelolzi up on the list in case anyone is looking for more resources.",

    "selftext": "I've been diagnosed with GAD and have had a few pretty bad panic attacks in my life. Last night I was driving from my old apartment to my first house I just bought with the last load of my house plants (I had about 35 in the car, it's a hobby of mine).\n\nFor some reason I'm still unsure of, I started having a panic attack. My heart rate went up, the pit of my stomach dropped, I felt woozy, broke out in cold sweat, and felt extremely anxious. Right before going onto the highway, I pulled to the side off the road with my hazards on to give myself time to come down off of this panic attack. I called my partner, who was at the house, and told him I was having a panic attack and he  worked with me to help me get grounded and calm. \n\nI ended the call after about 8 minutes and told him I would call him back when I felt good to drive again. The intensity of the attack was coming in waves at this point, but it was gradually lessening. Less than 2 minutes after the call ended, someone rammed full speed into the back of my car. My car was lurched forward with an awful crunch, plant dirt and debris flew every where, I was thrown forward but my seat belt caught me. I was OFF the road to the side with my hazards on, this guy had to have somehow swerved and not seen my car to have hit me. \n\nI had no immediate injuries, but I was terrified. I've never heard myself scream like that. The panic attack I had almost gotten under control was now replaced with absolute mayhem of fear and pure adrenaline. The guy came out of his car and approached mine, I was already on the phone with police. He kept trying to give me his license and saying he was going to give me his insurance info. I was sobbing and telling him to wait I'm on the phone with the police. He handed me his license, so I took a picture of it while trying to describe to the location to the 911 operator. He took his license and drove off without getting his insurance. He spoke not great English and I think he was terrified and didn't know what to do. \n\nThe police came with an ambulance. They took my vitals. I had no pain in my neck, back, stomach, or any where. I told the police what happened and showed them the pic of this guy's license. They were like \"WTF this guy gave you his license but not his insurance and drove off?\" That is a hit and run felony. I think the guy was trying to do the right thing but got scared and fled. The police caught him in about 30 mins. Turns out a car with a lot of front damage can't get very far.\n\nMy car was totaled, the back wheel was completely torn off and the back axel was twisted beyond repair. Many of my house plant's pots had shattered immediately. I had to leave half of them in the car as it got taken to an impound lot because there wasn't enough room in my friend's car who came and picked me up. I loved this car so much, it saved my fucking life. I was beside myself seeing it being towed away, broken beyond repair, with some of my beautiful house plants still in it. \n\nI am fully covered for by insurance so they will be paying me out for the value of my car. I will be able to go to the impound lot to get the remainder of my plants and belongings. \n\nWhat just strikes me as so fucking cruel was that I had a panic attack and chose to safely move off the road to not put myself or other drivers in danger, and I still got hit and my car was totaled. \n\nI'm so grateful to still be alive and not in tjr hospital. But I'm scared about what this means for me and my anxiety moving forward. Will I have PTSD from this? Will I be scared of driving/cars moving forward?",

I could see him taking deep breaths (subtly) and preparing himself. I asked how long I could hug him and he said as long as I wanted. When I hugged him, I asked him if I could give him a kiss, too, and he said yes, so I kissed his head.\n\nIt filled my heart with so much warmth and peace and happiness and I can still feel it a couple hours later.\n\nI truly understand anxiety and I know just how difficult this was for him. It was the most selfless and loving and special gift I could have gotten.\n\nAlso, as a side note, my older son got me an extra gift for my stocking because I‚Äôm divorced and this is my first Christmas as a single woman.

One by one, as they march, our comrades vanish from our sight, seized by the silent orders of omnipotent Death. Very brief is the time in which we can help them, in which their happiness or misery is decided. Be it ours to shed sunshine on their path, to lighten their sorrows by the balm of sympathy, to give them the pure joy of a never-tiring affection, to strengthen failing courage, to instil faith in hours of despair. Let us not weigh in grudging scales their merits and demerits, but let us think only of their need--of the sorrows, the difficulties, perhaps the blindnesses, that make the misery of their lives; let us remember that they are fellow-sufferers in the same darkness, actors in the same tragedy as ourselves. And so, when their day is over, when their good and their evil have become eternal by the immortality of the past, be it ours to feel that, where they suffered, where they failed, no deed of ours was the cause; but wherever a spark of the divine fire kindled in their hearts, we were ready with encouragement, with sympathy, with brave words in which high courage glowed.\"  \n- Bertrand Russell, A Free Man's Worship",

I was telling her how much I hate to pick up phone calls, hate doctors appointments, hate social gatherings, etc. She asked me why I hated them. And for me, it‚Äôs just plain uncomfortable. My mind goes to: who‚Äôs thinking this about me? why is this person calling me? Why do I have to do more bloodwork? If I don‚Äôt put myself in those situations, I don‚Äôt have to worry about all those things. \n\nShe says, that‚Äôs good! You‚Äôre beginning to see the root problem is discomfort. Comfort is something we naturally seek. It‚Äôs built in our DNA. BUT! Comfort all the time has a price. Just like too much of anything; coffee, sugar, working out, alcohol. You‚Äôve trained your mind to view discomfort as an enemy. The feeling of discomfort isn‚Äôt necessarily a bad thing. In some cases it can be, but in some cases it‚Äôs the process of growth. It‚Äôs like growing pains. Sure you feel achey but your body is in the process of moving to something better. It‚Äôs completely fine to feel discomfort when you start to actually pick up the phone, actually go out and get an oil change, or putting yourself out there to your friends. But the more you do it, the more you‚Äôll realize you can do. And the less it will be in the form of discomfort. Give yourself room to fail sometimes but by all means continue forward. \n\nIt took me a few weeks to think about and process this information until I decided to be brave enough to try. And I have to say, I‚Äôm glad I did. Just like she said, I began to see I COULD. And it‚Äôs been a game changer. Hope this helps someone else!",

    "selftext": "I‚Äôve had absolutely crippling anxiety for the past 2 years. I would end up in the ER, sometimes 2, 3, even 4 times a week because of intense panic attacks. I would have seizure like activity and the doctors thought I was having seizures when I was coming in or I had a brain bleed. It was horrible.\n\nBut recently I‚Äôve started working out. I walk for an hour at about 3.5 MPH (brisk pace) and lift weights for about 30/40 mins. Sometimes I‚Äôll skip lifting certain days if I‚Äôm too sore or skip walking if my shins hurt too much and use that day to self care and R.I.C.E. to avoid injury. \n\nWhen I tell you I‚Äôm a different person, I really am. Just after about a week and a half so much has changed. I haven‚Äôt had a panic attack or anxiety for about a week. I became a hypochondriac and would worry about every little thing in my body. I have chronic pain so most bodily sensations are extremely exaggerated because my nerve sensitivity. Even when I have bowel movements they can be uncomfortable for painful when most people don‚Äôt notice them. I‚Äôve really honestly ignored a lot of them. I can go through my day with my pain pretty much fine now. I‚Äôm starting to get some of my natural humor and confidence back. Not much has really changed on the surface, but my mind has healed to what feels like years worth of therapy. \n\nI‚Äôm planning on continuing this, and I would recommend you start if you haven‚Äôt been already. Once you start working out you will enjoy it, as long as you ease into it and don‚Äôt overwhelm yourself. You‚Äôll start to enjoy it and make goals. And the future will no longer be littered with fears and anxieties, but hope and motivation towards your goals. \n\nBest of luck to all of you!\n\nEdit: WOAH! I had no idea this was going to explode! Thank you everyone for the awards and your kind words. I wish everyone luck. I‚Äôm sorry to anyone who said they‚Äôre unable to workout for any reason. I highly suggest trying to contact a specialist (doctor/private trainer/psychologist/therapist etc.) to help you work through any limitations you‚Äôre having. Everyone should have at least one thing they can escape to to help their anxiety. \n\nI do still get some anxiety working out but with time it‚Äôs subsiding. What helped the most was easing into it and making sure I was comfortable with my heart rate before trying to push myself. It‚Äôs not perfect but it‚Äôs just enough freedom to allow myself to improve my stamina and strength.",

    "title": "Weird but Surprisingly Effective Ways to Reduce Anxiety",
    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI've been exploring unusual ways to deal with anxiety, and I thought I'd share a list of weird strategies that have worked for me. Like probably everyone else here I have tried a ton of different traditional methods to relieve anxiety such as breathing exercises, meditation, journaling, therapy, working out etc and while those are amazing methods that work for some, sometimes nothing seems to help in the moment. So I started experimenting and came up with some unconventional tricks (and some I‚Äôve picked up from others) that work surprisingly well for me!\n\nI have separated methods into different categories so you can browse each category depending on what works for you!\n\n**Body Oriented:**\n\n* **Turn Your Room Cold** \\- Turn the heat down or open a window. A colder space can sometimes help your body calm down.\n* **Chug a Bottle of Water** \\- It‚Äôs refreshing and forces you to pause for a second. Bonus: dehydration can make anxiety worse, so this helps on two levels.\n* **Lay on Your Other Side (Away From Your Heart)** \\- If you‚Äôre lying on your left side and can feel your heartbeat too strongly, flip over. It can stop you from hyper-focusing on it.\n* **Dunk Your Face in Ice Water/Take a Cold Shower** \\- This one feels extreme but it really works. It triggers your \"dive reflex,\" which slows your heart rate and calms your nervous system.\n* **Hold Ice Cubes or Something Cold** \\- The cold sensation brings you back into your body and out of your head.\n* **Sit on the Floor** \\- Just plop down wherever you are. Sitting on the ground can make you feel more grounded.\n\n**Mind Tricking:**\n\n* **Spell Words Backward** \\- Pick a random word (like elephant for example) and spell it in reverse. Keep repeating with different words until you are distracting enough to break the cycle of anxious thoughts.\n* **Count Things Around You** \\- Look around the room and count how many blue objects you can see or how many things are round.\n* **Force Yourself to Smile** \\- Even fake smiling can trigger endorphin release and convince your brain you‚Äôre okay.\n* **Do Some Math** \\- Start at 100 and count backward by 7s. Or do a Times table.\n\n**Behavorial:**\n\n* **Flip Your Environment Around** \\- Rearrange your furniture, your desk, or even just your pillows. Cleaning up your space can shift your mindset too.\n* **Play The Floor Is Lava** \\- Lol like the game you played as a kid. Jumping around the room is a great distraction.\n* **Eat Some Crunchy or Sour Snacks** \\- The texture, taste and sound give your mind something else to focus on.\n* **Wrap Yourself With Blankets** \\- Weighted blankets are ideal, but even regular ones can work.\n* **Gratitude** \\- Think about everything you are grateful for. This can help take your mind off of insecurities you are thinking about.\n\n**Environmental:**\n\n* **Turn on White Noise or Static** \\- The background hum of white noise can calm your brain if silence feels too loud. However, this one sometimes leads to hyperfocusing on intrusive thoughts, dissociation or depersonalization for me, so proceed with caution.\n* **Dim the Lights or Change the Color** \\- Swap your lighting for something softer or cooler (like blue or green tones).\n* **Smell Something Really Strong** \\- Smell something like peppermint, citrus, or even vinegar because a strong scent can \"shock\" your senses and pull you out of your anxious headspace.\n\n**Interactive:**\n\n* **Carry Something Heavy** \\- Holding something with weight can help ground you.\n* **Balance on One Leg** \\- It sounds weird, but focusing on balancing can help distract you.\n* **Scribble** \\- Grab a pen and just scribble as hard and fast as you can. Helps release energy, is super calming, and can help distract you\n* **Stare at Something Moving** \\- Watch a fan, a candle flame, bobblehead, the snow falling outside, etc. It gives your mind something repetitive and calming to focus on. However, this one also sometimes leads to hyperfocusing on intrusive thoughts, dissociation or depersonalization for me, so again, proceed with caution.\n\nSome of these sound ridiculous, but they‚Äôve actually helped me, and I hope they can help you too!!!",

Sitting here the next day, I can't believe I did that but I'm proud of myself. Just had to tell someone! Thanks guys.\n\nEdit: Just to add what was going through my mind at the time. My psychologist has really been getting me to expose myself to uncomfortable situations especially when you know they're going to be uncomfortable. I kind of figured she had a boyfriend/didn't date customers or whatever but I considered this an experiment in allowing myself to become uncomfortable, and just sitting with that feeling for a while. It's this kind of stuff that almost literally rewires your brain (albeit small amounts over time). If you keep avoiding things, your brain will get used to it and that's how you end up using avoidance to deal with being uncomfortable. If you expose yourself to those uncomfortable situations and allow them to run their course, those feelings start to become a lot less scary over time which can help build confidence. I'm no Psychologist so that was probably a C+ at best explanation but hopefully it makes some sense.\n\nEdit 2: Holy Moley the amount of encouragement and props is insane. You all are awesome.

    "selftext": "Before I start, I want to mention that I have not been diagnosed with anxiety so far, but this is the only community where I feel like I can let this out and ask this question. (Also im new to Reddit and don‚Äôt know how exactly this works, so if I do anything wrong please let me know) \n\nSo I‚Äôm currently 18 years old and as for my childhood I‚Äôd say it was okay. I was a pretty shy and ‚Äògood‚Äô kid so never got into trouble much. That‚Äôs also why I can‚Äôt recall ever being yelled at or hit. Maybe once, but my parent did apologise and state what they did wasn‚Äôt okay so I don‚Äôt think that would have affected me.\n\nHowever, I get so anxious when I hear anybody yell. It doesn‚Äôt even have to be directed at me. A few examples: one of my teachers has a pretty strong, loud voice. When he suddenly calls out a student‚Äôs name while I‚Äôm doing my homework, I pretty much flinch even though his tone isn‚Äôt even angry. \n\nOr a few weeks ago when a classmate wasn‚Äôt wearing a mask, a teacher followed them into our classroom and basically yelled at them for at least a minute. While this was going on, I forced myself to just look down at my notebook and focus on anything but the yelling. Though I tried to distract myself, my eyes were teary and I felt a lump in my throat and I was really tense for the rest of that class. I think that was the most anxious I had felt in years. \n\nMy sibling who is 12 can be described as a ‚Äòtroublemaker‚Äô I guess. They‚Äôre the opposite of me which can be good at times, but it sometimes gets on my parents‚Äô nerves. They don‚Äôt listen, aren‚Äôt okay with being told ‚Äúno‚Äù and pretty much do what they want when they feel like it. Because of this I often hear my parents being upset at them and I‚Äôve heard my parent yell at them a lot. Sometimes I‚Äôd be in the same room, other times I‚Äôd be in my room and they‚Äôd be downstairs. During these times I‚Äôll also get very tense and just have a horrible feeling. If I‚Äôm in the same room I won‚Äôt even say a word and just get up and leave because it‚Äôs too much. \n\nI have no idea what to do with this. I have an intake at a therapist next week for some mental health related issues, should I bring this up too? And does this happen to anyone else? I really don‚Äôt understand why this happens to me \n\nThank you in advance for the help :)",

I said sure, started prepping for the journey ( buses/trains are the most difficult part for me ). I ate all the right foods, slept enough, felt good. I took max dose of meds to \"guarantee\" success. \n\nEven with the meds and proper mindset, I was struggling at the second I left the house. Every step felt heavy, I wanted to turn back instantly. I made it to the first train then to the trainstation which had a bathroom. I had 45minutes to gather my thoughts before taking the next train to the destination.\n\nI got on the train and things just got worse and worse and worse. Every passing stop I just wanted to jump out, crawl into a ball and cry. 2nd to last stop it became unbearable. I jumped off the train and took the next bus home. Mission failed.\n\nI called my employer and was brutally honest about my situation. They seemed very understanding and offered to keep a 0hr contract indefinitely if I get my things together to a stage where I can reliably commute to work. So I made a good first impression and this guy seemed to appreciate honesty instead of me making up some bs lie about \" having some upper respetory symptoms \" or whatever which would've bought me some time. But I like honesty. I don't have to remember any lies and a lot of people appreciate it.\n\nEven tho they were very kind and understandable, I feel like absolute shit right now. For past 7months my **only** goal was get a job, go there, do well. Be normal. Today even with medication I couldn't do that.\n\nI haven't given up all hope yet and I'll start improving my diet even more and hopefully get to therapy asap. Apparently for people like me, sometimes the therapist meets half way if they know that leaving the house is difficult for the patient. Or even comes to your house. So that's great.\n\nThis was a major, major setback, but as my dad says \" You do everything you can, and that's all you can do \". I did everything. I prepared for everything. I had everything packed hours before leaving the house. I had a plan for when I get to work. But nope. Anxiety and panic disorder won this battle. Hopefully I'll win the war. \n\nAnd what gives a little extra twist to this: Traveling by car is fine. No problem whatsoever. But if I can't get to work, I can't afford a car. And if I can't take the bus, I can't get to work. Fml.",

My current job isn't hard, but it sucks the life out of me. Every weekend is too short, and every work week is too long. I never feel like I am rested enough or that I have enough time to do the fun things I like to do. I don't feel like I have hobbies anymore, and I certainly don't have very many friends. I feel like I have to spend all of my \"free time\" keeping my apartment together or resting to try and prepare for the following week.\n\nI don't know how people do this for the majority of their lives, and I especially don't know how people manage to do this while also raising children. I think of all the things I want out of life, including children, traveling, homeownership, and everything else that comes with that, and I don't see how it is possible for those things to happen working full time. I don't even make enough money to do those things, much less have the vacation time. I'm working on budgeting and building my savings, but the math never seems to work out in a way that feels comfortable. I promised myself I would see Europe before I hit 25 and I don't think that's a realistic goal anymore.\n\nI get stuck in this spiral of \"am I just lazy\" and start to get worried that it is only me. Maybe, somehow, I am the only adult who cannot handle working full time and isn't happy about this being my life for the next 45 years. Sometimes I feel ungrateful. My life is fine - I have a roof over my head and food to eat. I am privileged in terms of the type I work I do. Sure, it is mind numbing and often anxiety-inducing, but it is a job that pays enough for me to stay alive. That's better than a lot of people can say. \n\nCan someone tell me it isn't just me? Or maybe give me a reality check that it is? I just don't know how I can keep this up for another 45 years. I'm so tired.\n\nEdit: I've taken some time to go through all the comments (though I didn't expect so many) and have really appreciated a lot of the advice i've been given! It's great to feel not as alone in this discomfort, and I think I have some ideas and goals on how to improve my situation in this new year. Thank you all so much.",

    "title": "My best friend became a mass murderer. I‚Äôve never been the same since that day.",
    "selftext": "So, this is a really hard topic to talk about for me. It‚Äôs been several years, about 6, and while I‚Äôll forget about what happened, the generalized anxiety it brought still never goes away.   \n\nFirst off for context, I‚Äôm just gonna show who the serial killer was. It was a pretty big story in my state and really big on YouTube if you spent any time on there in 2012.  \n\n[Mr. Anime](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.texasmonthly.com/articles/disturbing-new-details-emerge-about-man-arrested-in-familys-murder/amp/).       \n\nAnyways, I woke up today with a comment from a video on YouTube that I posted on. It was a web documentary that someone did on him, and I thought it was a nice way to get some of this off my chest. Of course, this really didn‚Äôt help, and I ended up super anxious. People taunting me about it and all sorts of troll behavior you get in YouTube comments.   \n\nA little backstory: I grew up with Trey from the age of 12 until he killed his family when I was 22. I had been in contact and hung out with him up until like 3 months before he did the act. He cut contact with me around then which I‚Äôm pretty sure he either didn‚Äôt want to subject me to that or something.   \n\nWhen I say we were best friends, I mean we were BEST friends. I spent the night at his house 3 times a week. We had all night WoW gaming sessions, his mom would cook us lunch and dinner so we didn‚Äôt even have to stop raiding. His family was so good to me, they were basically a second family. I was in his first ever YouTube video, and I continued making shorts and sketches with him, and even helped with a couple of his anime reviews when he specialized his channel. \n\nWhen he moved to his grandparents house in Hempstead, I visited often, and we made it kind of a party house. He filled his cabinets with liquor and he loved playing the host whenever I came back from college to visit. We definitely indulged in pot and prescription meds, but we were young and stupid. I didn‚Äôt do drugs outside of our weekend chill sessions, and I didn‚Äôt realize he had been addicted to those and alcohol.  \n\nThe thing about Trey is he always was pretty secretive. If I ever asked him much about his life or his relationship with his parents, he‚Äôd try to change the subject. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I knew a lot about him, more than his other friends, but it took a lot of work by me to get him to open up. Many a night smoking weed and me opening up about my feelings before he finally did about his dissatisfaction with life, his lack of a higher education, and his fathers disappointment in him. I would always try to cheer him up and make him feel better and it seemed to work.   \n\nWhen the murders happened, I didn‚Äôt even know what to do. My girlfriend at the time comforted me, but I was just...numb. I literally didn‚Äôt feel anything. Then, my roommate at the time was like ‚Äúoh let‚Äôs smoke a bowl that‚Äôll cheer you up!‚Äù And that was when I had my first panic attack. I‚Äôm talking full on ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna die oh my god.‚Äù This went on for nearly 2 days. Constantly pacing and checking my heart rate. I couldn‚Äôt sleep or eat and felt like I was going insane. I actually packed up and drove to Dallas (I lived in Austin) to go to my moms because I didn‚Äôt know what to do, and she had a Xanax prescription and gave me one and I slept for nearly 20 hours.   \n\nI‚Äôve struggled with anxiety for years now. I learned it‚Äôs caused by PTSD from the events. I have no health insurance so I can‚Äôt really go to therapy unless I foot the entire bill so it really sucks, this is my only way to talk about it honestly other than friends who don‚Äôt really understand. No one really understands. My dad thinks I should just get over it, shit happens, but he‚Äôs never had his fucking best friend kill his second family! A family that was honestly nicer than his real family, who treated him with love and respect and not judgement.  \n\nAnyways, sorry for the erratic writing or if it jumps around a lot. I‚Äôm kind of in a panicked mindset because I got triggered by all the memories of Trey. It‚Äôs hard for me to organize my thoughts when I get into this mindset. It feels like I can‚Äôt focus on any thought and my mind is just swimming and it leaves me confused. If anyone has any questions I‚Äôd love to answer, but I‚Äôd also love some advice and support. \n\nThanks for reading.   \n\nEdit; \n\nEveryone that responded thank you so so much. You have no idea how much this means to me. I‚Äôm in this weird place between joy and guilt that this got so many comments. Joy because I realized people care so much about a random person, and guilt because I feel I don‚Äôt deserve that compassion.  \nYes I know that‚Äôs stupid but that comes with the anxiety sadly. Like others have said, I feel I may have a bit of survivors guilt because I learned I was actually a target of his, and I read and article by someone yesterday where he did an interview with Texas rangers. Supposedly when he was 13 he was considering killing one of his friends. I know that friend was me. I remember that day because we were playing with guns as country kids will do and I remember him aiming in my general direction but kind of doing a ‚Äúhaha I got you‚Äù thing that he loved doing.   \n\nAnyways, I‚Äôm trying to respond to everyone, but I work 11am-11pm the next 2 days (yay service industry). So if I haven‚Äôt responded yet, I will definitely try. I‚Äôll be going back to my inbox and on this post and trying to get to everyone. Thank you for taking the time to share and care seriously. ",

    "selftext": "Apologies in advance for the long post. This is something I've been struggling with for a while, so I'm hoping that by sharing my experience, maybe I can finally legitimize what I've been going through. \n\nI have been having what I now know to be panic attacks since I was very young. Over the past few years, they have been getting worse and more frequent, and most often crop up when I'm out of the house (especially when I'm at work.) For a long time, I actually wasn't sure that they *were* panic attacks, because my doctors/therapists always described something very different from what I experienced.\n\nContrary to what I was told by my doctors, I often find that I can function (or at least appear to) perfectly well during a panic attack. My heart is racing, my hands are shaking, my chest feels tight, I feel like my knees will give out with every step I take... and yet I can take a phone call at my desk and sound totally calm and professional. I can greet clients and smile and make small talk, and no one around me can tell that something's wrong. (It's almost like I do these things on autopilot, because later, I find that I usually can't remember much of what happened or what was said.) Afterward, when I don't have to put on my \"brave face\" anymore, I feel physically and emotionally exhausted; the shaking and chills take a long time to subside, and I sometimes cry uncontrollably at trivial things. \n\nI suppose I should add that a lot of my anxiety rests in not wanting people to be mad at me, or not wanting to let people down. Even when I'm feeling really anxious or depressed, I have trouble asking for the time/space I need to take care of myself because I don't want to upset anyone or make them think I'm incompetent. So, I guess it makes sense that even when a panic attack comes on, I still feel compelled to push those feelings down and force myself to appear \"normal.\"\n\nI am pretty wary of speaking to doctors/therapists about these types of attacks, because on more than one occasion, I have been told that I'm totally wrong and they absolutely **cannot** be panic attacks, because if they were, I'd be hyperventilating and I wouldn't be able to control them so well. I feel like they think I'm just being overdramatic and looking for attention. Sometimes it really gets to me, and I start to worry that maybe I *am* just being dramatic and I don't \"deserve\" to call them that because there's nothing wrong with me. It's to the point where even if I'm with someone I trust (i.e. my husband or my mom) I usually don't tell them if an attack comes on because I feel like if I did, they wouldn't believe me; from the outside, I'd appear to be perfectly fine. \n\nHas anyone else ever experienced anything like this? I feel really alone, so I came to you, people of Reddit, hoping that you can help me find some closure.\n\n\nEDIT:\n\nThank you all for your support, advice, and kind words. When I posted this I never imagined it would get this much attention. It‚Äôs so wonderfully comforting to know that I‚Äôm not the only one going through this.",

    "selftext": "I‚Äôm a 22 year old guy and my anxiety was horrible a year ago. I was unemployed, my life ruled by anxiety. I couldn‚Äôt drive, go out with friends, see a movie, and for a while didn‚Äôt leave my room. It got so bad I was severely underweight and stayed in a psych hospital for a few days. I began to see a therapist who did CBT 3 times a week, plus saw a psychiatrist and got on the right medication. \n\nNow I work in a big hospital operating room as a technician full time, I drive all the time, go on dates, and I start school to be an EMT Monday. Today I was assisting during a gastric bypass. I was fully scrubbed in, holding a camera where I have to be dead still, and it‚Äôs just me and the 2 doctors, all crammed around this patient. It wasn‚Äôt the first time I assisted during this surgery, but it was my first time with this doctor, who‚Äôs notoriously vicious, and at one point shit started to hit the fan. The room got silent, tensions where high, and my anxiety skyrocketed. My mask started to fog up and I was sweating, but I can‚Äôt touch my face and contaminate my gloves, so I was literally trapped. Then I remembered everything I had learned, I started to focus on my breathing and the work the doctor was doing. I thought to myself encouraging thoughts, and within a minute my anxiety dropped back down, and we ended up completing the surgery. The best part? The doctor told me I did a great job, something even the nurses had rarely ever heard him say to someone. \n\nThe point of this post? To look at where I was a year ago, basically bedridden from anxiety. Now I live a very full life and do things that I want to, not that my anxiety lets me do. You CAN improve and get your life back. If I did it, any of you can do it. The biggest advice I can give is please, get help. I was terrified but it saved my life. I still go to therapy once a month, and I‚Äôm still on my medications, and there is absolutely no shame in that. \n\nI hope this post maybe inspired even one of you. Dealing with anxiety has been the hardest thing I‚Äôve ever done, and I failed at times but didn‚Äôt stop trying. No one has to live like this, and no one has to do it alone. I wish everyone here the absolute best of luck conquering your inner demons, and I believe in you. If anyone has any questions feel free to ask, and my PMs are always open to help anyone! ",

    "selftext": "Hi. I‚Äôve struggled with this on and off since I was a young teen. I grew up in the suburbs with immigrant parents and one older sibling who was always out with huge groups of friends or gfs and never home. My parents never ever went out (socializing felt like a burden to them, didnt have too many friends, couldn‚Äôt spend too much money) holidays were just another day at home, never anything special. it wasn‚Äôt until the last decade now that all kids are grown and they‚Äôre retired that they started traveling the world and taking up hobbies and making friends. When I was a kid and I complained about feeling cooped up at home, they couldn‚Äôt relate to my anxiety. I always felt like my close friends always had ‚Äúother groups‚Äù of friends or huge families where there was never a weekend or day they‚Äôd be home moping. always had groups of friends besides our core friend group, so on random occasions where every person was occupied, it always hit me how extremely lonely I feel.\n\nnow, as an adult it still hits me here and there. Everyone knows I‚Äôm an extreme introvert and love being home. but lately I‚Äôll be home for 3-4 days straight, can‚Äôt bring myself to leave my 1000sq ft apt I live alone in to get the mail, take out trash, or drive to run errands as my simple ‚Äúsocialization for the day.‚Äù I have a bunch of things I could be doing outside, errand-wise, or at home (chore-wise, ex: decluttering closets, getting some freelance projects done, job hunting, etc.) but instead I can‚Äôt bring myself to do any of them and fixate on my loneliness. \n\nI let the dishes pile up, eat junk food/instant ramen, just waste hours on YouTube or the internet, sit around crying for no reason, and when people text me to hang out I decline.

    "selftext": "Hey team! \n\nI hope your holidays went well, and if not, I‚Äôm glad to tell you that you survived them and are here to talk about it!\n\nIf you‚Äôre here looking for a particular thread, please check out the following: \n\n* [2020 Umbrella Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/h036q3/2020_umbrella_thread/)\n* [Good News Coronavirus Thread 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/ioy7uo/good_news_coronavirus_thread_2/)\n* [Coronavirus Discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/izpdus/coronavirus_discussion_thread/) \n\nI‚Äôd also like to remind everyone that we have an active Discord server: https://discord.gg/9sSCSe9\n\nI wanted to talk about breathing.  \n\nA very common technique for coping with anxiety is to breathe deeply - you‚Äôve probably heard this or seen it in an infographic.  This is indeed a helpful technique, but unfortunately I don‚Äôt think it is explained well and I have often seen users say that it can make their anxiety worse.  This comes as no surprise when in response to anxiety or a panic attack all you hear is ‚Äútake a breath!‚Äù  Great, I‚Äôll do that, thanks.  I‚Äôm going to break down the proper technique piece by piece in the hope that it helps someone out.  \n\nWhen you are anxious many people feel like they are hyperventilating and the answer to that is because you tense up and your breathing becomes shallow and ‚Äúhigh up‚Äù (your breaths are filling your upper lungs) which makes the anxiety worse.  You are, in fact, hyperventilating, but you can fix this.  You are in control of your breath as much as it may not feel like it in a moment of panic.  \n\nWhat you want to do is called [diaphragmatic breathing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaphragmatic_breathing) (or belly breaths if you‚Äôre a normal person and not in a medical profession).   To demonstrate this, sit up in a comfortable position and place a hand gently beneath your ribs and on your upper belly - concentrate on expanding this area with each inhale.  This is the breathing you are aiming for.  \n\nWhat we will be doing is commonly called ‚Äú[box breathing](https://imgur.com/0N53Gah)‚Äù.  \n\nTaking belly breaths:\n\n1. Slowly inhale on a count to four (I find through the nose most effective but breathing through the mouth will do you no harm - just keep it slow). \n1. Hold the breath for a count to 4\n1. Exhale for a count to 4\n1. Hold the empty lungs for a count to 4.  \n\nRepeat until your anxiety eases or your breathing resumes a normal rhythm.  \n\nThat‚Äôs it!  I hope this explanation helps out someone, I know it certainly helped me.  Practice it when you‚Äôre calm and the next time the anxiety ramps up, give it a try.  I‚Äôve also used this technique to steady myself for taking low-light photos and building card towers.  Bonus.  \n\nLove, \n\nRemy",

Feeling confident and happy to be social and chat more to friends. I‚Äôm not used to feeling anymore than content for a few hours so to feel ecstatic for a few days made me feel like I was going crazy haha. \n\nIt goes to show I‚Äôm not used to any emotions in their extremes, including happiness.  I feel like true comfort is being in a ‚Äòmeh‚Äô mood. \n\nAfter talking to a therapist in the past about this it‚Äôs actually very common, chronic anxiety disorders basically put all your energy into coping with one extreme emotion and when you recover it sometimes unveils a tendency to feel very uncomfortable with emotions you did not previously express... like anger, confidence, and happiness. And was actually a trigger for one of my relapses... I was convinced I was an aggressive person that was dangerous because in around 10 years of my youth i did not express anger, not because it was repressed, but because anxiety was my default reaction to everything! I‚Äôm not an angry person.. and after a lot of CBT I‚Äôve come to accept all emotions that make us unique and often very confused people! I‚Äôm allowed to be happy. I‚Äôm allowed to be angry... and anxiety is ok in small doses too. ",

I get these thoughts that somehow get into my mind and I won‚Äôt let go of it and keep digging at it and keeping the topic wondering in my mind all day or for days even. It can be something so small and I can‚Äôt focus on anything else but that one thing or something multiple things. I have tried to explain this feeling to people close in my life, I try to explain it as having multiple tabs open on your browser and you are running through the tabs clicking and opening every tab as if you are rushing a last minute research assignment jumping from tab from tab. Whenever i explain my over thinking they tell me ‚Äúyou‚Äôre just making yourself over think, you‚Äôre doing this to your self just stop overthinking‚Äù which makes no sense to me!! How can I just stop thinking?? i would love to but my brain is just always running. This happens even when I am trying to go to sleep which makes sleeping soo hard i have gone to the doctor for insomnia and depression but I have never thought these are the results and side effects of having tons of anxiety. It‚Äôs all a dangerous cycle I have fell in for years. Although at first i remember it being mostly depression and feeling of helplessness but these days it‚Äôs not even me getting anxious from being depressed because I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm depressed anymore but I just anxious, more than I ever have been. So I‚Äôm starting to see maybe it‚Äôs anxiety that is the stem for most of my other problems. I‚Äôm so tired of it effecting my everyday life.

You already know you spent the time ruminating over it, you already took in every detail, now stop the cycle of over/repetitive thinking and decide. I know it's easier said than done, but with some practice this can be so helpful. \n\nMost fear/anxiety comes from the unknown, yeah? I think many people agree about that. We can never be sure what will happen in a future situation, so we tend to spin it *over* and *over* and *over* for no reason. Spinning it again won't make the answer any clearer, just make up your mind and stop. You'll see what happens when you get there, all that you can control is what *you* do leading up to it. \n\nI really hope this can help some of you.

You could even do a mock test with the person teaching you to drive. Just go to the place where you plan to take the test and drive exactly like you would during the test. You can have your teacher tell you where to go and end it with parallel parking somewhere. It will make you less nervous during the real test if you feel like you've done it before. Plus, you won't be taken surprise by driving in an unfamiliar area. \n\nBe sure to know where everything is in the car you are going to be taking, they ask you to turn on emergency flashers, point out the parking break, turn signals, wipers, etc. This is all dependant on where you live, but it couldn't hurt to know of course. \n\nAnd my last tip, be sure to pay attention to road signs. Two different times during the test, the lady pointed out signs we had just passed and asked me what they were/what they said. It's easy to forget or miss signs that aren't that important to you, but pay attention during the test at least!",

I woke up this morning and was greated with so many kind and lovely responses. \n\nI've seen quite a lot of people asking about how I got here. The thing is, I don't have a simple answer (although I guess the answer to anxiety is never simple).\n\nIf it wasn't for my lovely SO I wouldn't have gotten this far. At one point he said: I want to go on holiday. We don't have to be gone for long, we don't have to go far away. You can choose the location and if you just want to hang around the hotelroom every day that's fine. But I need a break from daily life. \n\nI spent most of the holiday in the hotel but I did go for a few walks. Having a panic attack in a different country feels different; the people who see you will never see you again, so it took away some of the shame aspect for me. \n\nAfter that summer college started again. I hadn't gone much the year before but I talked to my teachers and they allowed me to repeat the year. I didn't dare to take the bus (my anxiety is centered around being locked up) so I cycled to college every day for a while. \n\nWhen the weather got colder I realized I didn't want to cycle 13 kilometres through the snow so I tried going by bus. Not going anywhere, just getting in and seeing how many stops I could survive.\n\nSo, I kind of did exposure therapy on myself. I eventually got through the waiting list of a psychologist but by then I could go out by myself. After she went away for pregnancy leave I just pushed myself further and further. \n\nSO and I moved house in April to a cheap but lovely appartment in a lovely neighbourhood in a small village. I finally feel a bit at peace and I think that caused my sudden progress. \n\nThis probably won't really help anyone as seeing a  professional probably is better than doing it all by yourself. I am just lucky enough to have my SO for support, even if he will never understand how important he was in this process.",

    "selftext": "I have an anxiety disorder and often get panic attacks. I just got fired from my new job as a cashier in a supermarket. Sitting in the toilet room of a big shopping centre crying as I am typing this. This was my first real job since I finished school in may last year. So today was my first day and it all started really bad. Every bread and vegetable has its own number which I have to type into the cash register. I don't know any of them so I have to look everything up on a piece of paper. That takes a while and I'm not really comfortable with that cash register as I never used something like that before. It took me quite some time to get through each customer and I often had to call another worker to come help me. The line at my register got bigger and bigger. We have 3 cashiers but for some reason all the customers were in my line and my coworkers didn't really care. Then there was that older gentleman, I accidentaly typed in the wrong number for his bread, I apologized and called for a coworker. The man got really annoyed and started to yell at me, I didn't know what to do. The other customers just stared angrily at me and started to express how slow I am. At that point I was close to crying and I got a panic attack. Finally my boss came and explained he doesn't want me here and that I need to pack my stuff and leave. So yea, I don't know what to do, my parents are going to kill me. I'm lost, I can't even have a normal job for a day. \n\nI hope this is readable as english isn't my first language and I'm still pretty nervous about everything.\n\nEdit: Thank you for your kind words, I really appreciate it. I called some people and have a job interview this friday at a place I like\n\nEdit 2: Wow this really blew up huh, again, thank you so much for your nice comments. I've read all of them and I am speechless. Also a big thanks to the person who gave this post platinum, I appreciate it very much. I don't really know what to say, this community is so kind.

I thought my fear of talking to other people and my fear of making phone calls (often to the point of tears) was just me being shy. I thought constant chest tightness and pain was just normal stress. I thought it was normal for the smallest things to be beyond overwhelming. My intense fears of constantly fucking up had been with me for so long that I never thought twice about the rationale behind it. I have ADHD as well and when I thought maybe that was the cause of some of it, but when I got my adderall prescription, I wasn't magically cured of all my uncomfortableness. I was still a nervous, anxious person who also happened to be able to focus better than I used to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTwo weeks ago, the feelings became stronger than normal. I had aches in my chest for days on end. I was so nervous and on edge--more so than usual. That happened out of nowhere, then an unexpected loss in the family sent me over the edge in terms of panicking. It dawned on me after the worst had passed that maybe this is an anxiety disorder. I did a lot of self-reflecting and realized maybe I've been anxious all my life and I Just never realized it because I thought it was normal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't really know what the point of me typing all this out is, but it just feels good to know maybe there's hope for me.

The reason I have the anxiety is just the fear of being judged by others or saying something stupid.  I‚Äôve even been in group therapy (iOP) for weeks to try and find ways to lessen my anxiety, but I just feel  like I took a step back. Yesterday, I was so stressed out about this that I caused myself to vomit even; I‚Äôve had a migraine, some random nausea, and heartburn the last week due to the stress and anxiety too. Is there anyone else who has this happen?",

I was in the class we're in and kept sneaking glances at her. The feeling in my gut surged when I thought about asking for her phone number. I keep thinking of reasons why I shouldn't, even though I know I wanted to. I finally just told my self \"Screw it, I'm doing it\" and threw caution to the wind, ignoring the feeling in my gut.\n\nI asked her after class was over, and she had me give her my number and texted me afterwards. Idk if anything will come of it, but this felt like a huge milestone for me!\n\nUPDATE: I texted her some, but she seldom replied, and even when she did, she didn't very interested. I don't think anything will come out of this, but this was a huge milestone for me and I'm proud of myself nonetheless!",

It's been about a month. I also was having headaches and issues with my blood pressure, both of which are better. I didn't think I'd be able to do this (was having 3 to 4 cups of strong coffee and 1-2 sodas per day) but I feel so much better off it. I drink a lot of decaf tea and water. The first week was rough (headaches!) but I powered through and stuck with it. \n\n2. I stopped going on Facebook altogether. The whole \"comparison\" crap and drama, don't need it.\n\n3. I don't watch the TV news. Ever.\n\n4. I am not overweight, but I started exercising. My therapist told me this is a great treatment for anxiety and he was right. I just do power walk videos on You Tube, nothing fancy.\n\n5. I eat breakfast every day now (was not doing this before) and started eating more fruits and vegetables.\n\n6. My therapist told me to do more things that I enjoy. So with all the time I have since I'm not on Facebook so much, I am reading books. Light fiction, nothing that stresses me out. I also have been trying to do some of those adult coloring books, but sometimes I get anxious about what colors to use or if my picture will looks good (ridiculous, I know), so that's a process.\n\n7. I have the Headspace app and do some mindfulness. This is really challenging for someone with anxiety I think. Sometimes you don't want to be inside your head too much. But I have found the Managing Anxiety series to be really helpful, with the noting strategies and just acknowledging the anxious thoughts without judging them or trying to run away from them.\n\n8. My therapist also told me to do things that build confidence. So I try to focus on things I'm good at, because baking a delicious cake or doing a good job at my work does help me feel better about myself.\n\n9. I can't say enough good things about therapy and my counselor. This is the first time in my life (I'm 40) that I have taken this step and it is incredibly helpful. If you're struggling with anxiety, think about it. I started with my employer's EAP (employee assistance program) which offered 3 free sessions, and then moved on to a \"real\" counselor because it was so helpful. Look into if your work has this as an option, it's free! \n\n\nRecognize that anxiety management is a process, and not just a switch we can turn off. My instinct previously was to try to run away from it. I hated it and I was mad at it. But now I understand that it's part of who I am, I have to accept that and I have to learn how to manage it. Hang in there, friends. You got this.\n\nEdit: thank you for all the kind comments, and for the gold ‚ù§Ô∏è",

I hate that almost no one in Hawai‚Äôi (where I live) is taking it seriously anymore, tourists are still coming in, and our numbers are literally tripling by the day. \n\nMy OCD and anxiety has kicked into an intense high gear ever since this happened and it‚Äôs so emotionally draining. And it doesn‚Äôt help that every extreme precaution I take for my parents sake, they don‚Äôt follow. Whenever I get home from work or the store, it‚Äôs like a 30 minute process of sanitizing all my belongings that I brought, showering, washing my clothes, and cleaning my hands a million times. But my family doesn‚Äôt do the same so I‚Äôm worried that it‚Äôs all for nothing. We‚Äôve luckily been ok for the most part and I feel privileged to be able to say that. I feel a little silly complaining, but as a house full of essential workers (aside from my dad who got fired from his job at the beginning of COVID after 19 years) I‚Äôm just constantly on edge. I just wanna protect all my loved ones and I feel like I can‚Äôt. And I know I can‚Äôt. I just wish I could. \n\nI just needed to vent because like everyone else, I just feel so drained. But I still feel lucky to have what and who I have at the same time. I just wish this was over already. It feels like it won‚Äôt ever be.",

    "selftext": "For me it started a few years ago when I lived by myself and I couldn't take the complete silence. It just gives me too much free brain space to focus on my other senses. With sounds in the background, it's a bit easier to drown out stuff like heart palpitations or thoughts about how scared I am. I mean, it doesn't stop anxiety and I still get anxiety attacks but it does soothe me to an extent. So if I'm by myself, I have something playing almost all the time, usually from when I wake up to when I go to sleep, but especially at night. I wonder if there's any harm in playing sounds all day long. I don't play it loud but maybe the constant stimulation has a negative effect on the brain. Either way, I can't stop now, I just get way too anxious without anything in the background and I prefer a show with people talking to a white noise machine.\n\nSo, anyone do that too? What shows do you watch? I usually just rewatch shows old favorites, and I leave new shows for when I actually want to pay attention. I've been playing Friends and Brooklyn 99 a lot recently.\n\nEdit: This got so many replies! I appreciate everyone who took the time to comment. Pretty awesome that all of us here have the same experience, makes me feel less like a weirdo because my ex used to always be amazed how I can just rewatch the same show over and over for weeks.

    "selftext": "Hello all, I wanted to give an update on my progress in hopes to maybe inspire just one person to take that first step.  4 1/2 years ago I had a complete mental breakdown due to a number of stressors and my alcohol abuse reaching critical mass.  Prior to this I did suffer from anxiety for years but was still able to hold down a job, have a social life and be a relatively good father to my children.  \n    After being house bound for 3 1/2  years I wasn‚Äôt able to walk to the mailbox without having a panic attack. I was so depressed and defeated I didn‚Äôt see the point in even existing anymore. I felt I had nothing to offer this world so in what literally felt like a life and death decision I reached out for help. I called my local  NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness) chapter and tearfully admitted the hell I had been going through.  It felt so liberating just to hear my voice letting some of that pain out. After a half hour or so on the phone, the women kindly suggested I start talking to a therapist via video chat. I did some research and decided on a company called betterhelp. I was assigned a counselor and she helped me to come around to the idea of medication. I then began video chat sessions with a psychiatrist with a company Teladoc. I was prescribed 15 mg (after a gradual increase) of lexapro.  My wife of coarse had to pick up the called in script from the pharmacy. The first two months were not good to say the least, I had a lot of side effects but I pushed through and by the third month i started feeling a little bit of my confidence returning.  I would take little walks a couple hundred feet from the house.  I started to white knuckle drive around the block.  In May of this year at 5 months of medication, on a Saturday morning something in me clicked.  I just said fuck it, jumped in my car and drove a couple miles down the road through multiple stoplights to a Home Depot, went inside and made a purchase. It was TERRIFYING!  I was a nervous wreck but by the time I made it home I was so stinkin proud of myself I was gitty. I came right on here to reddit and announced my crowning achievement. \n     In the time since then I push myself everyday. Little by little expanding my comfort zone.  I now can drive anywhere in the city, I have even taken the freeway to the next city over. I go for walks with my family to the park. I have gone out to dinners and reconnected with some old friends. Most importantly the quality time out of the house with my children has returned me a mindset that I do have value, and I do have something to offer this world.  I still have down days but overall I am happy and proud of the progress I have made.   \n    For me the combination of medication and cognitive behavioral therapy has proven to loosen the chains of anxiety but none of this would have been possible without taking that very first step of many first steps,    Asking for help!   From the bottom of my heart I wish all of you the best.",

    "selftext": "Title pretty much sums it up. I feel like I can never relax, never live fully or happily, because I am simply constantly mentally preparing myself for whatever next bad thing will happen to me. For example, I finally met this pretty great person, we had a great time, and yet somehow, even when I was most happy with them, I was mentally preparing myself for the inevitable fact that it would fall apart (and it did, but, granted, that was because of lockdowns and stuff).\n\nHealth worries are also pretty prominent. Whenever I'm pretty healthy, I can never enjoy it, because I frankly am just getting ready and thinking about what next health woe will be thrown my way and how I will be miserable because of it. Even now, I have a problem where I literally can not stop thinking about worst case scenarios, regardless of likelihood. I have done everything I can -- called my specialist, set up an appointment, and will receive the next step in treatment, and I have refilled my current medication to treat it. And yet, here I am, worrying obsessively about infection or something -- despite me having this problem for three years and my worst case scenario not coming true. (\\*\\*knock on wood\\*\\*).\n\nI can't relax. I can't stop bracing for the next bad/uncomfortable thing to happen, and even when I am doing everything I possibly can, I don't feel good enough to live my life. I am tired and miserable. I know I need a therapist, but office closures make it tough to do so, especially as I want to see one in person.\n\nEDIT: Wow, I really had no idea this post would take off the way it did. It's funny that I used my throwaway account, for discussing some of the issues that I'm most embarrassed about, and am getting some of the best responses and best advice on.

About two months after graduation I started to really feel the effects of my anxiety. I was panicking that I didn‚Äôt already have a better job and that I was gonna lose my apartment because I couldn‚Äôt pay bills. After relentlessly searching until February 2018, I found a job as a sales rep at a cell phone store. Since February, I‚Äôve been doing great! I‚Äôll be making about $40k a year and after five years of struggling with bills, I can comfortably afford my apartment!\n\nNow, since about April, I‚Äôve been having anxiety, again, about me feeling like I‚Äôm not doing enough. I‚Äôve been relaxing a lot, going out to places with friends (because now I can afford it,) and playing a lot of video games(it‚Äôs always been a hobby.)  But I‚Äôm feeling pressure to go back and get a masters in the hopes of finding a better job and really going for something that I actually dreamed of doing. I just can‚Äôt find the will to break away from this relaxed mood the change in pay has given me. Every time I try to give up playing video games and going out with people, in hopes of working towards something, I go right back into this comfortable routine. \n\nDoes anyone else feel this way/get anxiety about this? If so...does it go on forever? Will there ever be a time that I feel fully, 100% relaxed and comfortable with how I‚Äôm surviving and doing things that make me happy?",

I didn't realise how much lack of sleep was affecting my mood.  \n\nNot having to go out means I no longer need to worry about my IBS related stomach problems. I also no longer feel pressured to socialise (im an introvert by nature and love staying at home and playing games / watching tv). \n\nWith all the time I have, I finally feel like I am no longer running behind the ball, and have the time to reset, rest and do the things I love, without judgement. \n\nIt just feels like the wonderful break ive always dreamt of but never thought possible.  \n\nAppreciate that this is a hard time for most and dont deny what people are going through.  I got lucky because I have a very stable job and its just my husband and I at home.",

    "title": "I decided to fight for net neutrality, even with social anxiety. It has been the easiest thing ever.",
    "selftext": "I am sure all of you have seen the posts across Reddit about the fight to keep net neutrality, and the FCC upcoming vote to dismantle it. Personally, I feel that we need to keep net neutrality, but you are, of course, entitled to your own opinion. I don't want to get into the politics of it all, but I'm sure you can find that elsewhere on Reddit.\n\nSo this is just my story about how it has been going for me to voice my opinion on the matter, even when I get social anxiety. Just picking up the phone and having to talk to another human can be difficult sometimes ‚Äî whether it be calling the store to find what time it closes or having to get support with technology ‚Äî it makes me nervous just thinking about it. So you can imagine what it must feel like to want to voice my opinion ‚Äî something I rarely do as it is because I worry about alienating people or making them upset. Especially when it comes to politics.\n\nThe main things that concerned me about calling my local representatives were... What do I say? My representative doesn't share the same political beliefs I do, so are they going to argue with me over the phone? Is there something special I need to do when they pick up? Maybe I should just hang up...\n\n**First off**, I used [this website](http://www.battleforthenet.com), which is an automated system that auto-dials your representatives for you, based on your ZIP code. Plus, it even gives you a basic script you can say. Literally, I said this word for word: \"Hello. I just wanted to call to express my opinion about net neutrality. So... um... yeah, I support 'Title Two' net neutrality rules and I would like you guys to publicly oppose the FCC's plan to repeal them. I would really like if you guys would contact the FCC Chairman and demand that he abandon his current plan. I don't believe we need legislation, so instead we really need you to stop the FCC from getting rid of the existing rules. So um... that's all. Thanks.\"\n\n**Secondly**, the dude on the other end of the line is just some staffer ‚Äî often some college kid that takes phone calls for the representative's office. They were practically a robot themselves, and to be honest, they don't care to have a discussion about my political beliefs, even if they don't share them. There wasn't any argument, nor did they say much of anything at all.\n\n**And finally**, I didn't hang up! I stuck with it, and just read the script. When the lackey on the phone was done hearing me out, you can press star (*) on your phone, and boom ‚Äî it hangs up on them, the automated system gave me a pat on the back (seriously, she says, \"You're doing great!\"), and it automatically calls the next representative.\n\n-----\n\nAt the end of the day, I felt relieved that I did it. I was so anxious about it at first! But when I spoke with these people, they didn't say much of anything, and I didn't feel scared because I realized their whole job is listening to people complain. The guy on the other end of the phone is just some dude who literally listens to calls all day and just forwards your comments to the man or woman in charge. The most that was said to me was when they asked for my address and ZIP code to confirm I lived in their district. That was it.\n\nLong story short: even with my anxiety issues, I found it to be easier than I expected, and it made me feel like I accomplished something.\n\nP.S. My first attempt was in the evening, after my representatives' offices had closed. I did this because I didn't want to talk to someone on the first try. So I just left them messages on their voicemail expressing my opinion, but I found that sometimes their voicemail was full. So I need to try again the next day, because otherwise, I'm not being heard.\n\n**tl;dr:** I expected to feel huge social anxiety calling my representatives to support net neutrality. Turned out to be the easiest thing ever, and made me feel like I made a huge accomplishment regarding my condition. It also means I actually did something that allowed me to voice my opinion, which made me feel good.",

I didn't mind the comments that had actual criticism on the ink itself, but there were just so many comments just shitting on me and enjoyment over it.

    "selftext": "Hey guys, I have been an avid follower of this sub for a long time and this place has been a constant source of panic attack relievers over the last few months. In my last session with my therapist, he told me that GAD is cured after 6 months of literal hell and dedication. I want to share what worked for me.\n\n**Background:** As with my fellow GAD sufferers, I have been suffering from constant worries and usual panic attacks over the last few years but I decided to take action about this (didn't know it was GAD back then) after a full-blown attack that lasted for hours and hours in early May this year. Started my treatment late May. In one of the panic attacks I was contemplating committing suicide but thank god I had the courage to stick to my routine.\n\n**Symptoms:** Luckily, never had any physical symptoms but diarrohea and mouth ulcers were common because of cortisol developed by Amygdala.\n\n**Aftermath:** I am waking up everyday with a buoyant mood and my life including social life, dating life and academic performance, all have improved!\n\nSo, let's finally begin:\n\n1. **Therapy:** Can't emphasize this more, CBT therapists will identify the problematic and impractical thought patterns associted with your Anxiety( especially if it's Cortex-based) and suggest you ways to cope with them via ABCDE, RRR techniques and so on. Some of these will work for you will and some not but these people are medical experts and you need to spend 2-3 months with a therapist before deciding to discontinue/move to a different Therapist. Self-therapy books do help but it's always better to have someone in the form of close friend or a therapist to assist in your journey.\n2. **Reading Books:** Rewire your Anxious Brain, The Mindfulness and Acceptance Workbook for Anxiety, and My Age of Anxiety,  are the top 3 books I recommend. Finally, I'd suggest reading posts on this sub. **Caution:** there are chances of feeling uneasiness or having panic attacks by reading few content so make sure you tell your brain that this is medicine beforehand\n3. **Meditation:** atleast 2-3 times in a day for 12.5 mins everyday. It's only one day in the last 6 months I missed doing this wonderful thing.Buddhist style of meditation worked for me. Mantra meditation, guided meditation are other alternatives. There are wide variety of resources available online. It could be possible that you don't see the effects in the initial few weeks but I'd suggest keep doing it blindly.\n4. **Gym:**  6 days a week non-stop in the last 6 months except for the weeks when I was travelling. It's scientifically proven that doing physical activity for more than 20 mins almost everyday improves mental health. Technically, doing exercises helps the body release endorphins that rearrange the synapse between the neurons if done for 10 weeks to see a significant results. This is massive in improving thought patterns\n5. **Being open:** Being open about your anxiety with your closed ones will enable to learn new strategies, perspectives and many more things. More importantly, you will have shoulders to fall upon during a full-blown panic attack\n\n**Others:** practicing gratitude daily, practicing my hobbies( soccer).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet me know if you have any questions",

I've been trying to get to the root of my anxiety and this morning, while driving to work, it dawned on me (no pun intended) that the source of my anxieties might have to do with my disdain of having to get up early for work.\n\nI have a problem where I can't stop thinking about work during weekends, when I'm home at night, on vacation, etc. Work dominates my thinking, but in an unproductive way. I don't go over anything specific, I simply ruminate about the fact that I have to do it. A lot of it has to do with my disdain of not being able to have full control over my time and having to sacrifice so much of my life to a job.\n\nI typically end up having a decent day at work, nothing wild. Every now and again I'll have a hell day. I often fear having those days, weeks in advance, and they typically never come, but they eventually do. \n\nGoing back to my time, a massive hurdle for me is accepting that I need to get to bed early so that I can have enough energy for the following day. There is something about that...and it makes me feel powerless. It feels like the rest of my life is just a waiting room for work but I realize how absurd that sounds. I know it's untrue, but we also live in such a hyper industrial and profit-addicted capitalist society that I know (unfortunately) that what I'm saying has some form of validity to it, and I wish it weren't so.\n\nAnyone else experience this? I'm a grown guy with a career and yet here I am, at the best job I've had to date, miserable about having to go to it because it means I don't have full control over my time.",

I have been slowly adding to this list over the past 4 years when I first started experiencing daily panic attacks and now I find myself rarely referring to it. Hope it helps someone else!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Note to Self**\n\n* Give it 20 minutes.\n* When you have a negative thought, replace it with a positive one or make up a positive one and fake it til you make it.\n* The more I say ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù, the better I feel.\n* It‚Äôs just your thoughts.\n* I don't know what's going to happen in the future but I know everything is going to be okay.\n* You got this. You know you're competent enough so that you won't fail in life.\n* What‚Äôs the worst that can happen if you fail? Nothing.\n* Look at the grand scheme of things. Don‚Äôt focus so much in the moment. There will be a tomorrow.\n* You don‚Äôt have to do anything.\n* It‚Äôs not what I have to do. It‚Äôs what I want to do.\n* If you feel doomed, that‚Äôs because that‚Äôs what anxiety tends to do. It escalates a situation that, in reality, isn‚Äôt going anywhere.\n* Don‚Äôt be afraid of your anxiety.\n* You are the play, and the world is your audience.\n* You shouldn‚Äôt be scared. Treat the event or activity as a challenge or opportunity.\n* Why do you feel like you have to do anything? You don‚Äôt have to do anything.\n* The best thing to do is not think about it.\n* Staying in the situation will teach your body that everything is ok and there‚Äôs nothing to worry about.\n\n(I know some things on this list repeat but I left them there for reinforcement)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**4-7-8 Breathing Technique**\n\n* First, let your lips part. Make a whooshing sound, exhaling completely through your mouth.\n* Next, close your lips, inhaling silently through your nose as you count to four in your head.\n* Then, for seven seconds, hold your breath.\n* Make another whooshing exhale from your mouth for eight seconds.\n* Repeat.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**AWARE Calming Technique**\n\n* Accept¬†the anxiety. Don‚Äôt try to fight it, because it will not take away the anxiety.\n* Watch¬†the anxiety. Tell yourself which changes in your body and perception you notice and try to look at yourself as if you are an observer of yourself.\n* Act¬†normal. Breath normal and remain calm. Don‚Äôt try to escape because that will make you experience your symptoms even more intense. Instead, stay in the situation and experience the anxiety fading away.\n* Repeat¬†the steps 1, 2 and 3. If the anxiety is not reduced to an acceptable level yet, then repeat the steps. You‚Äôll see that you‚Äôll calm down soon.\n* Expect¬†the best. Practice makes perfect, so practice a lot. Don‚Äôt focus on what may happen to you, because that chance is really small.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Other**\n\n* As cliched as it sounds, I really recommend trying to live one day at a time. You're overwhelming yourself by trying to do too much/fix too much/make too many decisions at once. Try to breath, enjoy each day as it comes, and give yourself small goals to get back on track.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Wow! This post really blew up from when I posted it during an anxiety attack. I'm glad that so many people find it useful and hope you guys gain as much mileage from this list as I have. :D",

I've always suffered from mild depression and social anxiety. I'm sure my parents know of it because of my mental breakdowns and also because my dad is a doctor himself. I love my parents but they are just too busy with their life and profession. They're hardly even home. They've remained uninvolved in most of life.\n\n\nSo this happened a few weeks back. I was really troubled because of school, couldn't sleep and was having a meltdown. I don't know what came over me but I went ahead and woke my dad. I asked him to come to the living room while sobbing. As soon as we sat on the couch, I poured my heart out to him. He didn't say anything. Except a few \"hmm\"s and nods. Lastly he calmly asked me if I would like to meet a friend of his ( he didn't directly say a therapist ). He then went ahead to tell me that my illness is valid and seeking help won't deem me as \"crazy\". I refused and went to sleep.\n\nThe next morning as usual my parents were not home but my lil brother (M13) was there. He asked me if I had talked to Dad about something. I acted confused. He then started crying and telling me that I should have told him if I was suffering so much. I calmed him down (which took quite a while) and afterwards he told me that mom and dad were talking about me. Dad told mum to make sure that the environment of our home was a happy place for me and they were planning to make time for me/family by taking some time off. \n\nI've never ever felt such love from any thing or person. I'm so so blessed. I'm just so thankful for my family. I feel like I can endure anything. I just wish I would have leaned on my family for support earlier. Please everyone if you're suffering, reach out to your loved ones. It can make a world of difference, I promise!\n\n\n\ntl;dr - reached out to my dad and got unexpected support and love from family ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**Edit** : Thank you so much to everyone for taking the time to write a beautiful comment! I am really blessed and I'll never forget that! I hope  my story encourages you to reach out to people. You're not alone. Again, thank you so much :)",

Check.\n\nPanicking at long job descriptions where the words blur together from said panic and nothing makes sense because my brain stops functioning as my heart palpitates and my hands shake?

Check.\n\nBecoming overstimulated and hyperventilating from the sheer amount of positions to scroll through? Check.\n\n‚ÄúThey expect *all* 45 bulletpoints of this from me? I‚Äôm not capable, I‚Äôm just a jack of all trades, my brain would explode on a daily basis, I can‚Äôt do this.‚Äù Check. \n\nRe-doing my resume 35 times because it‚Äôs just never *perfect* enough? Check.\n\nNot being able to decide what I want to do with my life and thus experiencing an overwhelming desire to just give up? Check.\n\nCatastrophizing my situation, which then turns into full blown panic attacks on a weekly basis because I haven‚Äôt heard back from any jobs and thus being convinced I‚Äôll be unemployed forever? Check.\n\nJob hunting is a soul-sucking experience for everyone involved. At the same time, I‚Äôm convinced it‚Äôs one of the most unbearable experiences for people who struggle with GAD. Or at least it seems to be for me.\n\nTyping this after waking up today to find myself finally recovering from two straight days of panic attacks coupled with some fabulous depressive episodes thrown in.

Go for an icecream, snuggle in a nice blanket... \n\n- if you‚Äôre not alone let people know you need a break to feel better, it‚Äôs a great first step if you are ashamed of your anxiety or try to hide it\n\n- when you have time, write down in a really small font size a list of things that make you feel calmer or relaxed (reading, music, whatever) - print it and put it in your wallet or anything you carry around because most of the time we just forget to do those things! \n\nWhen you feel overwhelmed, read the list and choose an item and DO it. It‚Äôs easy for us to fall in the trap of ‚Äúfreezing‚Äù and never do the things that we *know* calm us down.

    "selftext": "This turned out to be quite a long ramble/vent but I just needed someone to listen.\n\nI recently started the long process of getting a diagnosis and help for my anxiety. I haven't even gotten to a psychiatric nurse yet, not to speak of a doctor or an actual psychiatrist, but I have talked to the nurse who took first initiative in my case. She was very kind and offered to meet me face to face a few weeks before the psychiatric nurse appointment so I wouldn't have to wait well over a month to get any progress at all. During my appointment with her we quickly got to at least one of the reasons as to why I'm so anxious and it helped me realise that I have actually been prone to anxious behaviour from a young age.\n\nWhat's now bothering me is that after the appointment I started to realise that I was indeed displaying signs of anxiety or trauma responses as a child but none of the adults in my life actually noticed it or cared enough (or maybe knew enough) to do something about it. Absolutely no one. I had both of my parents and many many teachers who just ignored all of it and that is probably one of the reasons I'm such a mess today. I did not get the help I needed as a child and now everything is a million times worse.\n\nNow every time I get an anxious spell I cannot stop thinking about how the people who were supposed to care for me failed me horribly. It got even worse yesterday when my mother told me a story of her completely ignoring some quite alarming behaviour because she thought it was just a quirk of mine. I had an event I consider traumatic during my first ever swimming lesson in 1st grade. Long story short, the swimming instructor was angry screaming at me because I, as a 7 or 8 year old child, couldn't float on my own yet. After this event I completely stopped doing everything that had to do with swimming even though playing in the lake with floaties on was one of my favourite summer activities before the incident. I didn't continue swimming until over 5 years later when I finally learned how to swim due to mandatory swimming lessons as a part of school sports. Even now almost 20 years later I get anxious at the smell of swimming pools and chlorine and I avoid swimming halls, especially the one where it happened.\n\nYet somehow, my own god-damn parent, who was often overprotective of me, didn't think there was anything alarming about that. She was telling the story like it was just a weird little thing I chose to do, one of those funny little childhood anecdotes. And the swimming incident is just one of the many different events I remember, where I displayed anxiety symptoms and no one took them seriously. I just want to be angry and scream at everyone who did not notice my problems but that's never going to happen and I know that one day I will just have to make peace with the fact that most of them will never know how badly they failed me. But today is definitely not that day.",

THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH!\n\nEdit #4: As a medical student, I think it's my duty to tell you guys that the treatment for anxiety is based on therapy and medication. Anxiety is due to your negative thoughts due to any past experiences. You need therapy to fix your thought process, and that decreases or even eliminates anxiety If you have really bad anxiety, medication will help you cope. But it's not the solution because your bad thought process is still there. Meds are good to get your symptoms in control.\n\nYou need therapy in all cases of anxiety. \n\nYou do not always need meds. Meds are for those people who are having a harder time coping with their symptoms\n\nAnd your first therapist might not be amazing. You have to search for one that fits you. You need to experiment with therapists till you find one for you, and when you do, have faith and trust in them!",

I‚Äôve been at this job for 5 months now and the workload was immediately unmanageable for one person but I kept pushing through thinking I was just weak, I needed to work harder. After all this was an opportunity of a lifetime and others would kill to have this job!\n\nIt got to a point where my anxiety and depression was out of control. I dreaded work every morning and was crying 3 times a day every day for a month. I couldn‚Äôt stomach any food until dinner time. I wasn‚Äôt taking breaks and I was doing 12 hour days. Exercise was out of the question of course.\n\nI knew I needed to quit but I felt like I couldn‚Äôt. I didn‚Äôt want to be that person that gives up. On top of that I felt incredibly guilty that if I did quit, my workload would be dumped on my boss and the team. I was (and still am) anxious about what people think of me. Do they think I‚Äôm a quitter?\n\nAll I was focused on was others and I forgot about me. How sad is that. \n\nThe past week I managed to scrounge up the pieces of myself scattered across the floor and peel myself out of bed at 6:30 to run in the morning. I may have severe anxiety and depression but this is the one thing I can do for myself. \n\nI still have this nagging thought that I am crazy to throw away this salary but at the end of the day no amount of money is worth trading in my mental health for.\n\nI don‚Äôt have a fully laid out plan of what I‚Äôm going to do but all I know is right now I need to heal and recover. Financially I am okay and my angel of a partner is supporting me in this.\n\nI am by no means on the other side yet but I thought I would put this out into the world for anyone else who feels stuck in their job and afraid to quit. Feel free to DM.\n\nUPDATE: Writing this update on 10 June 2022 (a week out from 1 year ago). Thank you to everyone that commented at the time. Your encouragement really helped me through a tough time. Over the past year I have consistently received private messages from people that have gone through or are currently going through the same situation.\n\nAt the time of my original post I felt so alone because I couldn‚Äôt find other people going through the same thing. I thought I would just be sending a rant into a black hole and it wouldn‚Äôt mean much but it has really been worth putting out there just to see how many people have reached out and the conversations that have come from it. \n\nAs an update, I took 2 glorious months off and looking back, quitting was the best decision I ever made. I was ashamed and guilty for a while but I had the gift of TIME. To do things I wanted to do that had nothing to do with work and to heal. Of course I had incredible support so I could focus on building myself back up. I‚Äôm now back at work at a previous job (before the heinous one referred to above) and I‚Äôm doing well. I still have anxiety obviously but off anti-depressants now.\n\nIf you‚Äôre ever in the same broken state I was, I know that hesitation so well. I know its a tough decision but I still 100% recommend quitting. A career is not the entirety of life.",

I almost feel like it's \"attacking\" me when I listen to it or watch it, ramping up my anxiety levels & frankly making me feel almost paranoid. I'm having to stay off Twitter entirely, and off FB as much as possible. It's all so awful most of the time, and there's nothing I can do about it. I feel a bit guilty sometimes, thinking that as an adult I've got a duty to keep up with the news, and also, as a Christian, I ought to be aware of what's going on in the world so I can at least pray for it. I have trouble even talking about certain subjects now, because it can set me down deep, dark rabbit holes and trigger a depressive episode. And, although I feel really lonely and isolated, I still need to be careful what I expose myself to - for example, a friend of mine keeps pushing really scary conspiracy theories which does my head in. I don't mind talking to her about almost anything else, but not that, as once I've spiralled down, it can be days before I haul myself up again!\n\nI was trying to explain to my mother that I've got really burned out and feel hypersensitive. I'm not proud of myself for it, as I'm sure I'm not being very mature, but there's only so much fearmongering a person can take, and like many people (I suspect), I've been fearmongered half to death over the past few months.\n\nThese days, we're all connected 24/7 and there's almost no hiding from anything. We \"have\" to think about Covid all day, every day - we're not being allowed to put it out of our minds for even one second. When I was growing up, we had news programmes, of course, and newspapers, but somehow, it wasn't in our faces all the time & we could take a break from it. Also, the media seems to have been more trustworthy back then, even if it wasn't - at least, there wasn't all this fear of \"fake news\". Part of my problem these days is the feeling that i can't even trust what I read any more.\n\nSo I try to focus on other things: watching TV shows, knitting (I'm making soft toys to give to people to cheer them up a bit!), listening to audio books and podcasts, learning Irish on Duolingo and also praying, as I find that a comfort. It's hard though!\n\n(I'm not saying I don't take Covid seriously, btw - I do. I wear a mask on the rare occasions I go out and keep my distance.)",

    "selftext": "The last time I self harmed was about a year ago. (I know, even more depressing because it was near Christmas!)\n\nI have been dealing with anxiety and self harm for three and a bit years now. I didn't ever think I would get a mental illness and the fact that the self harm evolved from that was even worse. It's so weird to think that this one thing happening in my life changed everything for me. It was all very sudden as well. I started locking myself away from friends and family, school became a hell hole and I was just alone with no idea what was going on with my head.\n\n I never got treatment. My mum tried to get some woman to help me, she came to our house and I swear to god...she was useless. I appreciate the fact that my mum wanted to help but there was apart of me that didn't want the help. I'd been living with this monster for so long, it started to feel like apart of my identity now. I was scared that I wasn't 'ill enough' or I would be wasting my time there, they wouldn't actually care and they were just greedy for money. Thinking about it now I understand how crazy that sounds of me to think like that but who could blame me from the state I was in?\n\nMy dad started to notice and became infuriated with me. It's difficult to explain to people who haven't gone through it, so that just made it worse. A few people that did stick around would pop up on my phone, and it was constant. They wanted to know how to help and even I didn't know what exactly was wrong with me. How can someone help if even you don't know what's wrong? I had completely lost touch with the real world.\n\nThree years later, it's still extremely difficult but I persevere...because even though you may think it can't get better, it always does. I used to RAGE when ever anyone told me that but it's true.\n\nTo be honest, I don't think I will ever overcome my mental health, but I've been doing incredibly better thoughtout those three years. I've grown as a person, I've learnt new things, experienced new happy memories and I'm actually going to have a clean, joyful Christmas. This present time in my life is currently the happiest I've been since. The best part is that I'm thankful. Of course there are days when I think I wish it wasn't around but my mental health has taught me so much and made me stronger. I am thankful! So...THANK YOU ANXIETY! THANK YOU!\n\nRemember to love your brain and your body. You only get one life, spend it the best way you possibly can. Give yourself breaks, if you are having a shitty day don't force yourself into anything, take a day off and pick yourself back up the following day. Don't let anyone tell you that you aren't 'ill enough' to get treatment or that your mental health makes you 'worthless'. There is so much more to life than pain and suffering.\nAnd most importantly... Congratulate yourself for getting past even a couple of days, a few weeks, a few months. It might not seem like much to you but every extra day you don't self harm, you are beating it! I believe in you all.\nLearn to love your brain <3\n\nMerry Christmas guys x",

    "selftext": "My boyfriend and I have been friends for nearly 2 years and have been dating for four months. Yesterday was the first time I had an anxiety attack in front of him. He has known that I have anxiety but he's never seen it first hand.\n\nWell yesterday, I was hanging at his place anime on his computer when all of a sudden my anxiety overwhelmed me. I went to his bathroom for a minute hoping it would pass and then I broke down, I realized that I had been in the bathroom for too long so I quickly washed my face and went back out. Even though I had washed my face it couldn't hide the redness and puffiness of my face. \n\nAt first he didn't see it because I was on my phone and hid my face with my hair, and then he laughed and pointed at the screen and looked over at me, immediately paused the show and went \"are you okay?\"\n\nThat's when I pointed at my chest and through very narrow breaths said \"I'm.... having... an .... anxeity... attack\"\n\nHe asked why, and when he realized I couldn't talk he grabbed my hand and rubbed methodical circles. \n\nThroughout the rest of the attack, if I told him not to touch me he'd lay off. If I told him to touch me he'd wrap me in an embrace. He even pointed at me and looked at our dog and said \"Mom's sad. Give her love\" to which our dog jumped on me and gave me dozens of kisses.\n\nI just... aghast. I'm so happy he reacted the way he did. But in my head I thought he would have hated seeing my attack and would've reacted differently. I'm so happy he took it the way he did and I'm surprised as well. \n\nBut goddamn I love that man.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR I had an anxiety attack in front of my boyfriend and I thought he wouldn't reacted badly to it, but instead he held me if I needed it and backed off if I needed it and I really appreciated it",

It's a learning progress for us and we need patience.\n\nWe can be stuck in anxiety spirals for months and have anxiety attacks so bad that we lose a lot of weight because we are unable to eat, sleep or function and have very bad symptoms like puking or fainting.\n\nWe can be triggered by any stressful event and lots of things hit way harder for us like physical pain.\n\nI wish the medical world would put more focus on anxiety so we don't have to go to the ER 3 times in one week because our anxiety attacks are so bad we literally can't do anything.\n\nIm so tired of the mistreatment of us and people not understanding, feeling like i can never be myself or feel \"normal\" again.\n\nAll wounds will heal with time but it sucks we have to go through this terrifying traumatic experience.",

It's bad enough when you get it from people who don't even understand the concept of having anxiety, it's 10x worse when it comes from people within the community who also suffer from anxiety disorders.\n\nGoddamn I get it left and right from fellow anxiety sufferers the very moment I mention that I'm on medication. It always turns into preaching. You may think you're helping, but you're really not. There are many different preachy topics people get into, but the main sentiments are \"oh, you're just not strong enough and are weak and leaning on the meds because not using them would be too hard for you.\" Or \"oh they're really bad for you if you keep taking those you're going to end up with dementia-cancer by the age of 30\" \n\nFuck off. I experienced something traumatic. I was not able to handle it without the assistance of meds. Therapy alone did not cut it. Going for walks outside or whatever didn't help either, which some people smugly like to suggest. I was in so much fear that I literally disassociated from myself. Meds kept me from being hospitalized.\n\nI got shit from my doctor and people on here (not this sub specifically I haven't commented here before). You're going to die horribly for being on those meds! be afraid! be scared! feel ashamed!\n\nWell guess what, I found a fantastic therapist who completely understands my plight. In one of our first sessions when I told her that the meds saved my life and that therapy alone wouldn't have ever helped, she IMMEDIATELY agreed and was like \"oh yep definitely. It's too powerful of a reaction/feeling. I know.\" She herself experienced some trauma from her past, and she told me that when she stopped drinking and was on an anti-anxiety med for her panic disorder someone smugly told her \"oh so you dropped one addiction for another.\" Oh boy did I have some shared anger with her over that. \n\nI really don't care to hear anyone's \"help\" or \"advice\" when it comes to my choice to take medications. I don't want your shaming, or how you were able to overcome your issues without medication, good for you. I don't want to hear how bad it is for me health-wise. There's this holier-than-thou preachy mindset disguised as sympathy and I fucking hate it. OOooOOoo they're so bad for you! Guess what's also bad for me? Not eating or sleeping or fulfilling basic biological needs to survive due to fear. Hm. Wonder which is worse?\n\nI would rather live a shorter happier life due to relief from my anxiety due to meds than live a long tortuous life because that's what people say I should do. My doctor was brutal to me about being on the meds until I said essentially that to her, and then she finally laid off. \n\nAnd addiction doesn't happen to everybody. I had someone lecture me on how this medication I was on was going to give me a full blown addiction until I told them that once I was doing better I just simply got off of them and was off of them for months. They sure didn't have anything to say to that. \n\nSo bottom line, stop shaming people who choose medications, if you want to celebrate that you're so healthy and untainted by pharmaceuticals, go do it somewhere else. Not everyone is that lucky. Yes I'm bitter.\n\nedit: to be clear all of this mostly comes from the fact that I take **benzos,** which are apparently a big no-no to many people. I'm not sure if I would have had the same experience from people if I were taking non-benzos. People really love to scare me about those. But they saved my life and continue to do so, so, *shrug.*",

She urged everyone that electric toothbrushes are the best way to clean up dental health quickly.\n\nWith all this information in mind, I've been saving up money to go out and buy a Sonicare toothbrush with a gentle whitening toothpaste formula. Today, I finally did it. I bought everything I needed. I brushed my teeth for the first time in months. I have no more plaque buildup.

However, when I get back from work I find myself aimlessly scrolling through reddit or watching youtube videos. And my heart starts racing more as I become aware of how much time I just wasted. At that point, I feel so panicked that I can't do anything productive OR relaxing.\n\nI think this is related to a fear that's often at the back of my mind - of aging and not doing anything important with my life.

But I can't, I have to be strong and push it all down and \"carry on,\" so that the world doesn't fall apart, and it makes my anxiety all the worse.",

    "selftext": "**Step 1** - Think back to a moment when you were anxious or about a trigger that makes you anxious. If you are actively anxious you can use that as well. \n\n**Step 2** -Close your eyes and classify that anxiety. Give it a shape, a color or size and then picture it in your mind. Picture it and tell yourself \"This is my anxiety\". \n\n**Step 3** - Now change that shape in your mind. Warp it, shrink it, change the color to something calmer and send it away. Realize you are in control of how you interpret these feelings and that just as anxiety can enter your mind, it can also leave. \n\nIt's not an end all be all technique but I have found it helpful. This might be kind of weird for some but I've also tried giving anxiety a face in my mind, and then change that expression on the face to a smile. While doing that, also physically smile yourself. Smiling is not something you will typically do while feeling anxious, so just the act of smiling can trick your mind into thinking the stress and anxiety is not needed at this time. \n\n**Edit:** Since this got bigger I thought I'd provide an example for some people having trouble. For me my anxiety reminded me of a red spikey ball that bounces around my head. What I did was smooth out the ball, shrink it and change it to a nice shade of blue and watched it bounce away and out of mind. \n\nI think the purpose of this is to distract you slightly and give you a visual representation of something that's hard to define. It helps to see something literally change and show us changing our anxiety is possible! \n\nGood luck and have a great week everyone, you got this!",

Is this normal?\n\nEdit: u/ItchyLeftArm mentioned that this effect is \"General Adaption Syndrome.\" Here's an article in case anyone was interested: [https://www.healthline.com/health/general-adaptation-syndrome](https://www.healthline.com/health/general-adaptation-syndrome)",

Not because it was my \"glory days\" or anything like that, but because it was the last time I can remember being able to enjoy life as it comes, and to take things one moment at a time. Just being able to play video games and relax without my mind wandering to ultimately pointless things to be anxious about. Being able to enjoy my hobbies, being able to go out in public without thoughts consuming me about the judgement of every stranger that walks by. I miss the days of being able to do nothing productive, and not be wrought with guilt about it.\n\nI'm 26 now. The best way I can put things is that on paper, my life looks pretty great. Anxiety makes things pretty tough a lot of the time, as I'm sure you can all empathize with. I'm sitting here right now at 1 pm on a Saturday; I don't have work today, all my chores are done, the apartment is spotless, and my grocery shopping is all done, yet just sitting around and wanting to have a lazy day is the hardest thing for me. I suppose I just needed to vent about this. I miss the way my mind used to work.\n\nTl;dr: I miss being able to relax",

We feel that this thread is too taxing for us to moderate and is no longer worth the strain on our mod team like it was back when the situation was brand new. We want to thank everyone who has stuck around to help others stay level-headed through this whole mess!\n\nUpdate 3/27: Due to all the feedback we got from updates 3/20 and 3/21, we have decided to relax the requirements for posting links. You are free to post a link you want help with or to add commentary on to help others understand it in a less anxious way, and now you can once again post links to good news as well as create good news collections (see the current stickied comment which includes some info on reassurance-seeking behavior). Our one requirement is that you should refrain from posting multiple times over a short period with good news links. If someone does this we will begin taking down their comments as spam. In this case it would be better to put together multiple news links and then post them as a single comment.\n\nUpdate 3/22: [Click here to view version 2.0 of the list of most helpful comments and resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/t02f1o/comment/i1pkm2f/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n*~~Update 3/21: Please see the current stickied comment for more information. It is ok to include a link that is causing you anxiety and asking people to help explain it better. It is also ok to provide a news link alongside your own commentary about the article to help people understand what it is saying in a less anxious way. We're specifically going to remove comments that have one or more news links without asking for help or providing original commentary about the article.~~*\n\n*~~Update 3/20: We have seen a large amount of posts that are mainly about sharing/discussing specific news articles. Please remember to keep everything relevant to anxiety. If a comment is just a news link then we have decided we will have to remove it to keep the thread on topic.~~*\n\nHi everyone,\n\nIt has been requested that we create a megathread for all of the events that have been happening with regards to the conflict in Ukraine. We decided that this is a good idea since so many people have been experiencing extreme anxiety because of it.\n\nWe have opted to have this thread be sorted by Best for the time being. To read and respond to the latest comments you can manually change the sort to New. The reason we‚Äôre doing this is because we want the most helpful and most grounded comments to float to the top to help as many people as possible keep their anxiety under control during this difficult time.\n\nFor those who want to talk with other anxiety sufferers in more of a live format, feel free to join our official Discord server with this invite link: [https://discord.com/invite/9sSCSe9](https://discord.com/invite/9sSCSe9). We have added a special channel to it called \"#ukrainediscussion\" so people can talk about what's happening and help each other.\n\nAs always please remember to be supportive and report any problematic comments so we can remove them as soon as possible.\n\nThanks!\n\nThe r/Anxiety Mod Team",

I had some really hard tests and assignments this semester, a hell of a lot of panic and test-related nightmares, but I did it. \n\nI'm at a relatively difficult college and I even suffered through a horrible kidney stone that caused me to miss two weeks of class and cost me a trip to the emergency room. I also had chronic bronchitis that caused a couple doctor's visits as well. I genuinely don't have friends at college or groups I belong in. I have depression alongside this shit anxiety and I went through this all alone, away from any family or anyone that could help.\n\nIt may not be much, but I did it, and I made it through. And you guys can, too! \n\nPlease never hesitate to get the support y'all need. If you can, reach out to get accomodations with your school and if you get sick, let teachers know! Get doctor's notes. Most professors are more understanding than you'd think. \n\nY'all got this! I hope anyone who's semester just ended had a great one, and everyone else have a great holiday break and happy holidays in general.",

    "selftext": "I was what one would call a \"gifted\" child throughout grade school. I got straight A's, took honors and AP classes, scored highly on standardized tests, even skipped a grade. I never studied for tests or struggled with homework, I just naturally retained all the information I was taught. I loved reading, I would read at least one book each week. I never procrastinated and genuinely enjoyed going to school.\n\nAll those years of performing so highly in grade school led to me and the people around me having very high expectations for my academic performance. Unfortunately for me, I found it harder and harder to meet those expectations throughout college. No matter how hard I try, I am completely unable to retain any information I learn, which frightens me because unlike grade school, this is information that will actually be pertinent to my future career. I end up procrastinating until the last minute to study or complete assignments because I am afraid of performing poorly. Whenever I try to read, it can't keep my attention. I recently took a standardized test, and I just performed \"below average to average\". All of those \"gifted\" attributes from my childhood just kind of... disappeared.\n\nNow that I am graduating, I'm really scared for my future. I want to go into the sciences, it interests me and I care about it a lot... I'm just afraid that I'm not good enough. That I'm too stupid now. That I can't keep maintaining this image of high-performance and intelligence. I'm so afraid to try new things like research because I am afraid that I am going to fail and look stupid.\n\nI feel like being raised as \"gifted\" has caused me to feel extremely anxious and stupid now that I am in the \"real world\". I'm curious if there is anyone else in this community that experienced a \"gifted\" childhood, or high childhood expectations, and now suffers from anxiety? How have you personally dealt with this kind of struggle? Are the people around you supportive, or do they still hold extremely high expectations for you?",

I even have nightmares of becoming homeless after they pass.\n\nIts just hit me recently that im really growing up and going to start becoming independent. Get a job, go to college, move out, do my own shopping, pay my own bills, drive my own car, start a family. I cant even walk around my neighborhood on my own.. thats how bad this is. I cant pay in shops, i need to get my mum to because im too anxious. I dont even know if i know enough to keep me going on my own. I dont know how to pay bills, how to drive. I always rely on my family if i dont know anything or unsure how to do something. Im aware that i dont learn, i just get them to show me and i move on. I think a part of this is because if i learn all these things thats the first step towards becoming my own parent and that scares the living daylight out of me. I dont want it. I want to be a kid forever and have people surrounded by me and not feel alone. I want to be my own person yes, but i dont want to be *alone*. I dont know enough to be independent, i know i dont. Im soo anxious to get a job, to drive. Its the little things.. like i have to mind the house keys and the car keys, i have to pay the bills, i have to walk up and pay for my own shopping, i have to go to the bank. Being 27 and living with your parents still is known to be ‚Äúbad‚Äù or ‚Äúunhealthy‚Äù. Apparently it means you arent your own person. I dont believe this because my Mum has lived with her mum all her life and she‚Äôs independent, to an extent. I want to be my own person, but i cant be independent im so scared of going into the world on my own.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice on how to handle my anxiety and outlook on this?\n\n*(edit: i did not expect this to get so many attention i dont have time to reply to everybody but just know ive read all the replies and i appreciate them so much! its so comforting to know that im not the only one who feels this way <3 )*",

I know it's anxiety, I even felt a panic attack starting yesterday but have no clue why. I'm not thinking about anything that could cause this anxiety. Anyone else with this? What do you even do about it? If I had anxious thoughts I would know what to do but now I seriously have no clue.\n\n\n\nEdit: wow thank you all so so much for the support, advice and awards. You guys are seriously amazing!",

    "selftext": "There‚Äôs really no point to this aside from venting. I never post much on Reddit since I tend to get really anxious about it. \n\nI posted a really nice picture of my grandparents on old school cool and it blew up. The responses were 99% positive and I got a lot of sweet messages, and there was absolutely no reason for me to even be worried. But I spent all day yesterday in a constant state of anxiety. The more traction my post got, the worst my anxiety felt. I really wish I wasn‚Äôt like this, I really hate that something so silly can trigger such a big reaction out of me.\n\nEdit: I know it‚Äôs a small thing, but I feel really understood. I don‚Äôt have many people in my life who I open up to about anxiety so it was really nice to have support even if it‚Äôs just in a Reddit post :)",

    "selftext": "I got blindsided by a bout of anxiety that has completely squandered any reason I earned to feel good about myself this year. I finally left a job I hated, ended an unhealthy relationship, and by some miracle got intermittent work in a career that I actually love but for no reason at all last week decided to crush me. I suddenly feel like I have nothing to offer and will never find professional or romantic security and I‚Äôve gone to bed in tears every single night for the past week. I hate feeling so worthless yet so paralyzed by the idea of confronting any of these thoughts head on. Fuck this disorder.",

Guess what‚Ä¶. i went to my local shopping centre today and I went to a few different shops to get different things!\n\nThis is huge for me because I haven‚Äôt been to this shopping centre since August 2023, the last time I was here I felt so dizzy that I thought I was going to pass out. This is the furthest I have travelled in ages! I stayed with my mom on the phone to help me distract myself and to ensure that I didn‚Äôt feel alone. I also left the house at around 9.30 am as the shopping centre is normally very calm at this time. I spent about 20 mins in there. \n\nI just wanted to share my victory with you guys ü•π\n\nEdit: I am so overwhelmed by all of the positivity üò≠ and it truly warms my heart that my post has encouraged others to try to challenge themselves with more exposure! Towards the end of last year I couldn‚Äôt even leave my BED. If I can do it, I‚Äôm almost certain that you can to! I will keep you guys updated when I make my next outing! Thanks everyone üôÇ",
