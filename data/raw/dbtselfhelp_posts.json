Engaging in pleasurable activities like exercise boosts them. You can also Eat spicy foods, listen to music or laugh a lot.\n* **Meditation:** Finding some time alone and working on some changes could help.

Is Radical Acceptance just acknowledging that these things exist? Because I guess that makes sense if someone is struggling to acknowledge the past or that these world events are happening, is it more than that?

    "title": "How to Fine-Tune DBT Therapy/Skills So It Sticks & Has More Significant Benefits?",
    "selftext": "Hello, so I am someone who currently has a BPD diagnosis (which I believe CPTSD fits better) but regardless I have struggled with intense self harm and SI/related behaviours as well as many attempts some of which have landed me in the ICU and have me very lucky that I have not sustained further damage. I did a DBT therapy program from ages 14 to 19 and I find the skills don't stick and I feel like it doesn't work/isn't effective for me. I am starting with a new therapist and she wants to try it again but I am doubtful (to be fair were only 2 sessions in so far but I like her so far as well.) \n\nThe DBT program was the full standard and was specifically geared towards youth. You met with the therapist for individual therapy 1x a week, a youth worker an additional 1x a week and phone coaching was also involved especially towards the end. (there was no groups this was a program based off of individual therapy and providing wrap around supports for the youth and their families)\n\nI loved that program and did benefit from it, but not necessarily from the dbt itself and more so that it was a very supportive therapy program and I desperately needed therapy.\n\nEvidence wise DBT is gold standard for self harm and suicidal behaviour. So why do I feel like its done basically nothing above just having therapy in general? I had to switch therapists several times during the program so perhaps having to build rapport over and over didn't help the scenario.\n\nI want to give DBT another chance and I think the way it was presented to me on top of still living in a traumatic/subtly abusive situation stunted the expected progress everyone expected DBT would help me gain. I am now out of that livinf situation although homeless so the DBT will have to wait until I can acquire housing and have both my meds and diagnosis reviewed by a new psychiatrist I see for the first time on the 31st.\n\nEither way I want it to stick this time. I'm sick of living like this and have for a long time. I'm sick of being in so much emotional pain, having a crisis derail my life for 3 days straight (doesn't do this as much anymore thankfully but that's the past 3 weeks so very, very recent.)\n\nI know I will still need trauma therapy but everyone has agreed, myself included that EMDR and similar is not even thought about to be in the table until I can have some stability in handling my emotions. (No more/significantly reduced suicide attempts.)\n\nWhich makes sense. Its not a good idea to open up the doors and dive deep into the painful ugliness of trauma if I can't cope with painful emotions and especially so if that would result in frequent attempts.\n\nI have noticed therapies such as IFS, and ACT as well as books on the topics (including DBT) geared towards children of the ages 8-12 seem to be the most helpful/engaging for me both in content/how the therapy skills are presented as well as these 3 modalities as well. (DBT being unsure as mentioned before although there was minor benefit.)\n\nI am wondering whether there is a better way to have this presented that might work better for me, recommendations for books more than welcome. Although being able to access free resources would be more appreciated in the immediate term due to money being very precarious right now.\n\nCurrent diagnosis that might make an impact are: Autism, BPD, (C)PTSD, Depression/Anxiety along with Psychosis, and Addictions (established with opioids and suspected with alcohol.)\n\nA note on addiction: have been clean from opioids since September. I know having a clear head is important in all of this and being high wont help that.\n\nBut yeah, in conclusion, how can I work with DBT in a way I can actually comprehend, so far books that deal with these things geared towards older children (8-12) and creative workbooks help a lot. Adding an element of creativity or puzzles and such and not being so dry seems to help significantly. But unfortunately childrens books in such don't go into enough depth with these topics as I need or should to get the full benefit of the therapy. \n\nI will be working on these materials with my therapist. She asked me to get ‚ÄúThe Dialectical Behavioral Therapy Skills Workbook‚Äù for us to work together on which I plan to get once I am finally paid (hopefully) next week.\n\nI have tried to use the skills repeatedly, I often end up contacting crisis lines or distracting myself for a bit but the thoughts are very sticky and almost an addictive behaviour after all of this time. So I am doing the work to try and get better. At 16 in group care I required 1 on 1 support due to being so high risk to i still have gotten a long way from that.\n\nBut yeah, in terms of reframing how DBT is presented so that it can stick better and I can actually have significant benefits from the therapy (which I don't doubt could be very beneficial), any ideas?\n\nThank you and sorry for such a long post, I hope the breaking of paragraphs helped at least a bit with the readability.",

    "selftext": "I‚Äôm struggling a lot with my mental health right now. I have bipolar disorder, along with anxiety, depression, and addiction issues. The past two and a half years have been particularly rough. My biggest challenge is that I never feel truly relaxed, and despite trying a lot of different approaches, nothing seems to help.\n\nAt my psychiatrist‚Äôs recommendation, I started DBT, but I‚Äôm finding it more stressful than helpful. A big part of the process involves filling out a ‚Äúdiary card‚Äù each week, which tracks my behaviors and decisions. I find it overwhelming to dissect every single choice I made and explain my reasoning behind it. The therapy seems overly focused on the ‚Äúmicro‚Äù level‚Äîanalyzing specific decisions and their outcomes‚Äîwhile neglecting the ‚Äúmacro‚Äù issue: the fact that I‚Äôm constantly tense and nothing seems to calm me down.\n\nUltimately, my goal with treatment‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs therapy, medication, or lifestyle changes‚Äîis to finally relax and feel some peace. But the DBT skills don‚Äôt seem to address that for me. When I brought this up with my counselor, she explained that the skills aren‚Äôt meant to make the pain ‚Äúgo away,‚Äù but rather to help me ‚Äúget through it.‚Äù That explanation hasn‚Äôt brought me much comfort because I really need the pain to stop, not just to endure it.\n\nMy mental health is bad enough that I feel hesitant to quit therapy altogether, but I‚Äôm questioning whether DBT is the right fit for me. Am I setting myself up with unrealistic expectations for what DBT can accomplish? Or has anyone else felt this way and found a way to make it work?\n\nAny advice or shared experiences would mean a lot. Thank you.",

Also sorry for the long post, but this is important, I really need help overcoming this. \n\nI seem to have some sort of inferiority complex when it comes to my intellect. I can't determine if I am a smart or dumb person and my self-worth is pretty much strongly tied to my intelligence. I don't think I'm that smart. My parents think I'm dumb, or at least my father did because I dissociated for much of my childhood (Se trickster, I guess?) I disassociated and didn't pay attention in school AT ALL. Also I wasn't allowed to take science for religious reasons. I managed to completely repressed that I didnt take science until I read about it in some IEP paperwork I found. Same with a former therapist I had who I don't think was very smart and she had Ti trickster. \n\nSo basically at my core I think I'm a dumb person (except at typology I believe I'm good at that even though most would disagree. Also I am pretty fixed on my spiritual beliefs) and this belief is somewhat subconscious. Most of the time without thinking I will comment on posts with my opinions as a way to feel smart and I will get offended if someone doesn't seem to agree (this also seems to happen with beliefs? Like if someone doesn't share my spiritual beliefs, is open to my beliefs, or if I think they have dumb spiritual or religious beliefs, this is something I also need to work on) Also I have these grandiose rambles throughout the day in my head, usually done subconsciously where I am literally imagining myself explaining my thoughts processes and beliefs to say friends who don't share an opinion or belief with me and in my mind I am like coming up with evidence and points for why I am right. I am literally not aware that I do this but I do it many times a day when I am taking a break from something. I realized that I seem to feel a sense of pride when I'm doing it which is why I guess I keep doing it subconsciously. Doesnt help that growing up my isfp bro would constantly get into huge fights with me and his Ti demon would keep calling me stupid. Oh also, I've been doing this ever since I was very young. \n\nThis is very ingrained so I'm not sure what to do. I started by looking into something called Intellectual Humility and honestly I've been studying so many things all day everyday for months that I've been too exhausted to read most of it. But I will. ",

Makes therapy in general hard because I feel I need to answer all sort of social questions before I can feel better. I suspect I'll be stuck forever because of the opaque nature of society. There are no answers, and yet I require answers to function. ",

    "selftext": "So the reason I go to therapy for my CPTSD is to untangle everything and actually heal.\n\nA big motivator in that are my often very bad states. I'm basically in a freeze state / crisis 24/7. But that motivates me to actually dive deep in therapy and do the hard work.\n\nRecently I had the chance to start in a DBT group. I find the idea of lowering the pain of existing, and being able to regulate better, pretty great. \n\nBut the truth is that I need to be in a crisis in order to want to heal. If I learn the skills to make life bearable or even enjoyable, why would I want to do the hard work in trauma-focused therapy? There won't be any reason for it. And I will never find my true self.\n\nAlso I can articulate my experience of the crises better when I'm in them. And DBT will take that away from me. I'm not feeling okay, my life is not okay, and I want my therapist to see that. I don't want to feel okay after everything I've been through. I want to be dysfunctional and in pain. DBT will take the only proof of what happened to me - my pain - away from me.\n\nThose are my biggest fears with DBT.",

    "selftext": "I am slowly coming to terms with this, as it‚Äôs also one of the ‚Äúsimplest‚Äù and yet sometimes hardest skill to use and understand.\nI‚Äôve been out of DBT since 2021 but I recently had a brush up on radical acceptance after I started therapy for some mild passage of time OCD. \nEmotional distress is always hard for me to deal with, and I think it‚Äôs human nature to run away from the uncomfortable. But in doing so, trying to avoid any unpleasant feeling in turn makes the negative feelings that much stronger when they come up. It‚Äôs a fact of life that there will be good and bad days, you can‚Äôt have happy without sad and anger. \nI found that trying to be kind to myself during moments of frustration, or days where I feel unmotivated or am down has made a shift in my overall mindset. \nInstead of getting upset that nothing I‚Äôm doing is working to make me feel better, or how much time I‚Äôve wasted being in a bad mood, wondering why I‚Äôm in a bad mood and what can I do to fix it, I simply accept that this is how I feel in this moment.\nI remind myself that I will not feel this way forever and to accept that this is the way it is for *right now*. \nIt sounds so simple but it really does work over time, when you come to accept the feelings that come up during your day instead of running from them, they in turn become less intense. \n\nIt‚Äôs not about deciding not to let it ruin your day, it‚Äôs accepting that maybe it will, maybe it won‚Äôt and either way it‚Äôs ok. It‚Äôs ok to have days where you feel like crap, it‚Äôs okay to have days where things don‚Äôt go your way and there‚Äôs something peaceful about being able to just be okay with not being okay because I know it will not be this way forever. I know it is easier said than done and it doesn‚Äôt always work and sometimes I have to keep reminding myself to just sit with it if I can‚Äôt do anything about it immediately, because again the natural response to feeling negative is to try and get rid of it. But in some cases like with OCD or with normal feelings of distress it only does more harm than good to ignore and pretend it‚Äôs not there. \n\nThat‚Äôs it, that‚Äôs my TEDtalk and revelation for the day.

So if you have tried them, which ones? Did you find them helpful? How do you use them? (Ex: at home, occasionally, in bed, as part of a routine, etc.)\n\nPersonally, I like them but have never stuck to using them consistently. I always want to think of them as flash cards you can use on the go, but I don‚Äôt find them helpful like that since the skills are more than rote learning. I prefer to go through a few at a time or find some that currently resonate with me and focus on those instead of flipping through a bunch without really absorbing/mentally reinforcing much. ",

    "title": "Need Help for Overcoming Anxiety and Life Skill Issues",
    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI hope it‚Äôs okay to share my story here. I‚Äôm really struggling and could use some support and advice. I was raised by a narcissistic mother in Bangladesh, and I‚Äôve faced mental abuse from her my whole life. This has left me with low confidence, serious anxiety, and mild depression. Growing up, I didn‚Äôt socialize much, and because of my mother‚Äôs controlling nature, I missed out on learning basic life skills during my boyhood and teenage years.\n\nSince moving to the UK, I‚Äôve finally started to learn things like cooking, which felt like a huge step for me. But even simple tasks can be overwhelming. For example, tying my shoes can take me a long time, and I still struggle with basic self-care. One of the biggest challenges I face is my decision-making. I often make very poor choices. Like, if I need to go from point A to C and I know I should go through B, somehow I‚Äôll end up taking a completely different path. It‚Äôs incredibly frustrating because I don‚Äôt always get to C, and it makes me feel lost.\n\nI got married recently to my amazing wife, who is the love of my life, but I wasn‚Äôt mentally mature when we tied the knot. Now that we‚Äôre building a life together, I realize I have so much to learn. I have this dream of becoming a father, but my lack of self-awareness and decision-making skills makes both my wife and me hesitant. If I can‚Äôt take responsibility now, how will I manage a child?\n\nI feel fatigued, tired, and demotivated all the time. I‚Äôve talked to a medical professional, and I was diagnosed with low folic acid and vitamin D, which they said could contribute to my headaches and fatigue. I often suffer from migraines and sinusitis, which don‚Äôt help my mental state either. I have trouble remembering important things, crucial steps in daily tasks, and it upsets my wife. It‚Äôs tough to see how this impacts her, and I want to do better for both of us.\n\nI also have significant anxiety when it comes to talking to new people. I avoid social situations as much as possible, and if there‚Äôs a group meeting, I find it hard to speak up even if I have questions. I bite my nails and the skin around my fingers constantly, which is another sign of my anxiety. I‚Äôve even taken therapy sessions in the past for psychosexual issues, including struggles with fantasy, porn addiction, and masturbation.\n\nNow that I‚Äôm in the UK and no longer under my mother‚Äôs control, I‚Äôm trying to stand on my own two feet. But I‚Äôm afraid to take jobs that require physical or technical skills‚Äîlike making burgers‚Äîbecause I worry that I might mess up and get scolded or fired. The lack of self-confidence is paralyzing.\n\nI‚Äôm reaching out to see if anyone has been through something similar or has advice on how to build confidence, improve decision-making, and navigate these challenges. I really need some guidance right now.\n\n**TL;DR:** I‚Äôm struggling with anxiety, poor decision-making, and basic life skills due to a difficult upbringing with a narcissistic mother in Bangladesh. I dream of being a father, but my lack of self-awareness and responsibility makes both me and my wife hesitant. I‚Äôm desperate for advice on building confidence and improving my life.",

I've noticed that the worksheets in Linehan's workbook break down a value into it's components.\n\nI feel this is externally imposed or overly structured for me rather than coming from my own reflections and beliefs. I worry that I won't work towards them as they don't relate to my wisest mind/ experiences.\n\nHas anyone come across any alternative worksheets/exercises that are more open to reflection?\n\nI do have a sense of what my values are but I'm struggling to find the words. Any recommendations would be much appreciated.\n\nTIA!",

    "selftext": "I've been in therapy on and off for like 15 years, and a few years ago I found a winning combo of treatments and skills that I felt pretty set to handle things on my own. But with all remaining friends moving away, I've tried going out and meeting new people.\n\n But everytime I try going, I just freeze up. And it's extra concerning because while ive always been socially anxious and struggled making friends, this especiallyly has never really happened before. but it's happened now multiple times a week for the past few months. I'll even get dressed, be excited, drive all the way there. And then just. Be unable to make myself do it, Like? I Do all the emotional regulation and social skills things I've been taught ((forgive me, I've done loads of therapy but remembering specifc acronyms is NOT a strength of mine)): made sure my physical needs were taken care of, fed and watered and only in the daily baseline amount of pain (about a 2/10 for me lol) opposite action [getting up and moving to get ready to go], thinking of what I'm missing out on, reminding myself I've done very similar things before and it was literally *fine*, deep breathing, positive self talk, positive mantras,   mindfulness grounding that 54321 technique [probably worth noting that that outing\" was the worst because of that lol it sent me directly into a sensory meltdown].))\n\nAnd then I'll sit in the car for up to an hour before driving away. I'll do the skills in the car. I can't even tell you what's going through my head really. I'm just frozen. It's a disconnected telephone signal in there. The only brief lucidity I get I use to try and clam myself down and walk myself through doing the simple act of leaving the car and I just. Haven't been successful. \n\nYesterday evening I tried to go to something I fully believed I'd finally go to. I was excited about it. Planned my whole day around it. Purposefully didn't dwell on in order to avoid overthinking it. And I ended with a new low of not even leaving my house. \n\nI'm at my wits end and I don't know what else to do. Any ideas? I'm looking for a therapist again, I have an appointment later this week, and I have other mental health concerns I'm working on, but this is easily the most concrete behavioral problem I'm having. \n",

She was my best friend. \n\nThis week literally all of my friends have either ignored my messages/cancelled plans we had together/completely forgotton about plans we already made. It's been so, so painful. I'm expecting this to be one of the most difficult times of my life and I feel like I have NO support. \n\nMy friends are not bad people, but I'm starting to see a pattern where I turn up for them, but they aren't the most reliable. \n\nI would really like to learn some skills to cope with  this. So far I'm using radical acceptance. Any other suggestions to cope with my current friendships causing me pain would be great. \n\nI also would like to start making some new friends. I have been awful at making friends all through my life, I've always just had a couple of very close friends and the ones I have now I have had for years.

    "selftext": "Just curious if anyone else has had a similar experience. I went through DBT last year, finished in Oct ‚Äò23. My therapist and I saw each other biweekly until around Christmas when she said I‚Äôm good to be done with her. Around Feb I had a minor trauma happen and I saw her then to process it. A couple months later I reached out telling her I was struggling and asked if we could make a couple appointments, she emailed back saying no, she was only seeing DBT program patients. A couple months went by and I wrote again saying I‚Äôm still struggling, I‚Äôd like to find a new therapist, asked her for suggestions on where to find someone and also for info about EMDR. She again rebuffed me, emailed back and said she didn‚Äôt really know any non DBT therapists to suggest to me for either type of treatment.\n\nI was pretty taken aback. Both emails were kind in tone, but troubling to me. She knows I struggle with rejection and shame and I feel both email replies did just that. I‚Äôm more sensitive than most people but I assume she would have remembered that and given some thought to her replies. \n\nIt‚Äôs made me feel like just someone she could bill during that year. She hasn‚Äôt contacted me again to check in (not that I‚Äôd expect that really but after a year + of intense therapy I thought she might have been invested in my well being). Is there a policy in dbt where they cannot reach out to see how you are? \n\nWe had such a good rapport that I don‚Äôt think I imagined. As I said I really struggle with rejection and rejection dysmorphia so that has been weighing on me. I am proud of myself for finding my own EMDR therapist and it‚Äôs been so far so good but my new therapist agrees that I am valid in feeling this way.\n\nIt just breaks my heart when people let me down and I feel like that‚Äôs what I will remember now about someone who I give a lot of credit to for helping me through a rough period in my life. I‚Äôll always be grateful but just wish she would have given me more than two borderline flippant replies when I was politely asking for help and resources through a depressive period. ",

    "selftext": "I've been on the DBT since 2018. My mental health is stable. \n\nI became disabled over night. It's become a Functional Neurological Disorder diagnosis. Because of my history of trauma, and the surgery I had 5 days before I became disabled, I've done a lot of work from that approach. \n\nI've recently started a DBT skills group. I don't need the support of the full program. Just a refresher on the skills and being willing to try a new approach. I also started EMDR recently to address the trauma and pairing my mind/body. My desire is to recover from my Medical Trauma. \n\nI just got done with a program for FND. I found out I'm capable of so much more than I thought. I've been encouraged that I will walk again. It just may take awhile. I need to move through this next level of trauma though. \n\nI've only approached DBT from a mental health perspective. Utilizing skills to recover from all those maladaptive coping mechanisms. Uncovering the first level of trauma. \n\nMy Neurologist from the program said that I need to approach this DBT from the disability/physical health perspective this time around. \n\nI'm already reflecting on all the times my health was invalidated growing up. All the times my mom \"got tired\" of taking me to the hospital. There was one time I broke my hand and it took her days to decide that maybe I needed to go to the hospital. By that time there wasn't anything they could do for it. \n\nSo after all this, my goal is to learn how to approach this group from this physical health perspective. I've been a part of groups since becoming disabled, trying to approach it from my new perspective of being disabled. But no one can relate to that. Even the person running the group can't really understand it. \n\nThat's okay. I'm going to do the best I can. But I'd love any support or new perspectives on how to approach DBT from a physical recovery perspective. \n\nThanks for hanging in there ",

I don‚Äôt eat or sleep enough /engage with please as much as I could be. I feel like I‚Äôm at a point where I feel like I have to constantly ‚Äúchoose between the lesser of two evils‚Äù. I don‚Äôt have a lot of time/energy in my day to be able to get everything that I think I need to do completed. I work full time, am doing an ‚Äúintensive dbt program‚Äù and experience bpd + narcolepsy. So Saying I‚Äôm burnt out and overwhelmed is an understatement. I‚Äôm trying to show some self compassion, it‚Äôs just not helping long term. \n\nWhat are some steps/excersises I can do to start getting my shit back together and is there anything that I can fall back on when I notice me slipping again?

Basically I'm trying to get people to behave how I want them to, would be the shortest possible phrasing.\n\nObviously that doesn't work too well, and kind of breaks the general tenets of learning radical acceptance and dialectical comparisons.\n\nThe problem for me is that the skills I use most feel useless for it. STOP doesn't fix a problem that is in front of me, walking away for a while just prolongs the time until the problem is fixed, urge surfing follows the same pattern... I don't know what to do, but I know that if I let this behavior rear its ugly head again it's going to ruin things for me.\n\nAny insight or tips? I plan on discussing it with my therapist at our next appointment, but that's probably 2 weeks out unless I can get a quicker slot.\n\nThanks all.",

We absolutely love the house we‚Äôre trying to buy, we don‚Äôt want anything else. The process has been fraught with setbacks. We were nearly ready to get to the exchange of contracts (which means it‚Äôs actually going to happen) and we‚Äôve just found out the person we‚Äôre buying from has lost the place they were buying. The technicalities aren‚Äôt really important, but basically it‚Äôs a very stressful and difficult situation in which I really have no power or control, and whether this works out or not is up to other people and not me.\n\nI‚Äôm finding it incredibly difficult, to the point where my inner voice tells me that if one more thing goes wrong then I‚Äôll need to kill myself. To be clear, I‚Äôm not planning any self harm - but the stress and uncertainty is unbearable and suicide is the ‚Äòoption‚Äô my brain gives me at times like this. Anything to do with my home is a big ptsd trigger for me, and I‚Äôm also autistic so uncertainty is incredibly hard for me.

    "selftext": "Hi, I'm not a doctor or anything but I was diagnosed with BPD in 2021. I have been in remission for about 2 years now and I wanted to share my strategy that has allowed me not to have developed an FP for 2 years.\n\nThis works best IMO to prevent a budding FP attachment, though it has alleviated some symptoms for me regarding my previous FPs. ( I do have to do this method several times to stop the FP from forming)\n\nI just hope this helps someone. All the info I have found on Fps online is about how to manage the attachment, not stop it from occurring in the first place.\n\nMy goal posting it here is just to spread the info within the BPD community, we gotta have each other's backs <3\n\n*Disclaimer: I don't know anyone named Alison, it's just a random name that starts with the letter \"A\".*\n\n**Favorite Person Protocol**\n\nThis method helps manage some symptoms of Borderline Personality Disorder by preventing strong attachments to \"favorite persons\" (FPs) and reducing emotional ups and downs related to them.\n\nIt has been my experience that the ‚Äúfavorite person‚Äù attachment can be felt on a qualitative level before it is fully formed. There is a period of development that if disrupted allows for disillusionment and emotional reconciliation that prevents a prospective FP from becoming a mature FP. This worksheet is most effective when used during that period of FP development.¬†\n\nSteps to Follow:\n\n1. **Write Down Your Thoughts:**¬†Use a journal to write down all your initial thoughts about the person you're becoming attached to or currently feel attached to. You can make a list or write in paragraphs.\n2. **Create a Two-Column Chart:**\n   * Left Column: List positive thoughts or idealizations about the person.\n   * Right Column: List negative thoughts or devaluations about the person.\n3. **Ground Your Thoughts in Reality:**¬†For each idealization and devaluation write a grounded statement on a new page that brings the person back to reality. Avoid seeing them as either perfect or completely flawed. For example:\n\nEx. Idealization:¬†*\"Alison is far more beautiful and intoxicating than anyone alive.\"*\n\nGrounded statement:¬†*Alison is very beautiful, at the same time she has imperfections. There are some people who are more charming than her, even though she is very charming.*¬†\n\nEx. Devaluation¬†*\"Alison is a soulless evil witch\"*\n\nGrounded statement:¬†*Alison can say or do things that are immoral, though sometimes she does moral things too. She can be unusually cruel, but there are people out there who are more cruel than she is.*\n\n1. **Embrace the Gray Area:**¬†The goal is to see people in shades of gray, rather than just black or white. This helps to reduce the strong emotional impact they have on you.\n2. **Regularly Review and Update:**¬†Revisit this exercise whenever you feel yourself getting too attached to someone (FP) or when your emotions about them feel overwhelming.\n\nWhy This Helps:\n\nThis method is based on psychological theories about how our thoughts can become extreme (black-and-white thinking) when we develop intense attachments. By practicing this protocol, you can prevent new attachments from forming too strongly and lessen the emotional power of past attachments.",

    "selftext": "Hello all...I've been quite ambivalent in to go to who to feel heard in the realm of therapy and healing choices. To give some context and to self disclose, after leaving a stable job that I stayed for in 9 years dedicating my time there but in the end I felt stuck and unhappy and anxious leaving I started acting in a hypervivgolant manner the fight / flight response. Forward 2-3 years I still am in this path of seeking therapy but also I still couldn't put myself back in the job market I instead pursued some acting workshops and theater psychodrama and qi gong I did a lot of things but still avoiding the issue with money and having a job or purpose other than self discovery. Also I live with my mom and I'm around 40 and I'd like to change that but I can't push myself too hard but I also have to be realistic. On the flip side I met a girl and we been together for 1 year and I always struggled with romantic relationships I have to admit this one brought up a lot of feelings. So currently I've been seeing this therapist from a trauma perspective he specialises in DBT and parts works and so far it's been not easy someday I want to not go back and see talking about my issues is stressing me out or seeing myself more as not good enough it's been 17 sessions in we still didn't start the DBT work yet he is approaching from an attachment and complex trauma..Im not diagnosed but I have this instinct that since childhood and teenhood ami had low self esteem and maybe some early ADHD not sure though but I overthink a lot specialy in relationships I have an older sister and she left the family and we don't see eye to eye but I feel I still look up to her she had her own journey but now I'm noticing how everything she believes in healing as gospel and I feel invalidated or doubt myself when other people tell a different opinion about therapy and how it's a waste of time ... I did tell her that this is important to me but I was still not convinced. She believes more the power of the uncosiess self and she went another path more of a Jungian believer and archetypes...so back to the therapy I am seeking how do I know if this is the right therapy for me... sometimes I get confused and fearful and tell myself that I should be seeing another therapist and leave this one or go to a Jungian analyst (which is not available in my country) or see a certified IFS one..in the end I decided to stick to therapy and the trust process either self or towards other people have been a struggle..Since January I had a nervous breakdown and ever since I been pro active and reflecting what that meant and why that happened and how can I be less harsh on myself and take myself a bit less seriously it's hard cause anxiety is always there plus the hypervigilanfe and self esteem...I've been reading Jon Kabat Zinn and some philosophy books and it's been helping me a lot reading is my solace lately doing interpersonal relationships has felt heavy and it should not be that way...so it's a long post but maybe I need reassuring voice ...fyi the therapist concluded that my attachment style is disorganized style and that's been insightful but hard to make sense and accept I am grateful that I have a family and few friends I can trust at least and all the figuring out what or who I want to be has been internally stress ful...I notice that I either buy a lot of self books when I'm stressed or watch a lot of videos about mental health that sometimes soothes me but then overwhelms...then underwhelms...also sleeping is difficult for me....phew that it's ü§ó",

I find that the TIPP skills (temperature, intense exercise, paced breathing and paired muscle relaxation to be very helpful) The most impactful for me in the Temperature skill. When I am in crisis it feels like I am feeling every single emotion in one moment and it is so hard to stop and organize what I'm feeling. When learning the TIPP skills in DBT, my instructors gave us this gel ice mask that goes in the freezer to demonstrate using temperature to regulate. I found that it gave me the calmness and time I needed to be able to better organize and sort through my feelings. Once more stable I'm able to deploy different skills like mindfulness. I found the mask that they provided in my DBT class and they are reasonably priced and I just wanted to share because I hope that it can be truly helpful to someone else as well. I'll leave the link to amazon if anyone thinks this could be useful to them. But of course, different things work for different people, I just hope this can be potentially helpful in some way.

I want to do anything I can to get better, but I also feel a bit tired out by all the therapy right now, and would value having some time to do the things I‚Äôve been learning about (mostly prioritising spending time on things that aren‚Äôt work or other people).\n\nIt would also complicate work - I‚Äôve had some time off to focus on health, and I need to find permanent role soon (ideally part time but can‚Äôt be too picky), and don‚Äôt want to limit my opportunities.\n\nI also don‚Äôt struggle with routine or isolation which I‚Äôve heard is the appeal for some people with these groups.\n\nSO.

    "title": "How to maintain progress after DBT therapy?",
    "selftext": "Hi! So basically I was in a 16-week complete DBT program, it literally was finally the first time therapy worked for me and give me hope and I was at rock bottom when I started it, and felt so much more adaptable and competent as it progressed. Life changing, and my life was an absolute MESS before it. The thing is, right at the very end of it, an ex and I had an interaction that sent me into crisis for the last 4 weeks of it and it felt like my brain just blacked out any and all memories of the past few months. I never took notes after my individual sessions because I would get extremely anxious trying to write everything down, and I only took a couple notes here and there during group.\n\nWhen it dawned on me how much I had blacked out at the end of the program, I felt completely at loss. I am so afraid of over time, my skills and ability to use them effectively would decrease, as I feel like now all I have to rely on is muscle memory and I can't look back on anything or consciously recall anything. I have the workbook, obviously, it's just that there's so much that goes on behind the scenes in a DBT program to utilize the skills in the workbook properly, and I don't remember any of that. I'm terrified of losing my progress that I've made in therapy, it's been six months now and I swear I can already feel my muscle memory and understanding of how to use skills *for me* (as in, using them while overcoming all the unique obstacles I particularly when trying to because of my childhood and my obsessive, overly analytical/anxious personality) declining. I don't want my life to ever become what it once was again or even anything close to it in any way. I'm so terrified of that happening and I don't want it to happen again. How do you recommend maintaining skills and progress after DBT? What is everyone else's personal experience and input on this?\n\nIn case some suggest doing another round of DBT, currently I'm in ERP treatment for my OCD (side note: I'm actually working with a DBT-informed therapist for my ERP). I cannot do DBT and ERP at the same time because of my insurance, and I also won't be able to return to DBT after I'm done with ERP because my insurance will stop covering the program I was formerly in on August 1st of this year. I also can't put off ERP to do another course of DBT, because my insurance will stop covering the ERP program I'm in on Aug 1 as well. I know they cover other providers, however they are just not as ultra-tailored to what I'm looking for and without the BPD diagnosis (I don't have BPD, I have severe anxiety and damaging behaviors), other DBT programs in network (if there are any, likely there aren't) wouldn't accept me.\n\nTL;DR I'm terrified of losing my skills and progress after DBT therapy. I don't have notes form back when I was in DBT. What do people recommend for maintaining progress after DBT therapy, so they don't have to go back?",

But recently, we just finished a module, and everyone who had been there since the beginning has left. I am now officially the 'oldest' member of the group.\n\nI miss those people.

I thought this wasn't possible and my self-worth and self-confidence feels crushed - how can I use skills to get through this? \n\n\n\nmore details:\n\nI've looked through the FAQ and elsewhere online and can find nothing about this. All I find is website after website repeating that the only way out of DBT is to miss four sessions. You can tell your therapist you hate them and you want to quit, and as long as you turn up again without missing four session, you're still in. No other way to quit.\n\n  \nI've been attending full programme DBT for the last 8 months and finding it really helpful - very difficult, but definitely improving my mental health. I've struggled a little interpersonally with my individual therapist - they were almost never on time for appointments, had quite a blunt manner, sometimes sarcastic and thin on praise - but I stuck at it regardless and feel I've made real progress from attending group despite this. (This is NHS in the UK so it's not so simple to just swap therapist).\n\n  \nHowever, a month ago shortly after trying to use DEAR MAN and GIVE FAST to ask my therapist to change a few things, e.g. provide a bit more praise when I use skills, be a bit clearer giving skills coaching, they decided to put me on \"vacation\" without providing any reason. After months of telling me I was on the right track with DBT, and of course agreeing to renew the contract at 6 months. Then yesterday I found out my mental health team had a meeting with the therapist in which they've decided to fully discharge me from DBT, the reasons given that I'm not using skills and DBT is making me worse.\n\n  \nObviously I disagree with this and am raising a complaint but I'm really struggling to cope with it in the meantime. My problem-solving is maxed out but it feels impossible to check the facts because my therapist, who I spent the last 8 months building trust with, is now contradicting fundamental facts about my recent life. So I feel like I don't know what's true any more and I can't trust my own senses - or the \"raw data\" we are supposed to rely on for mindfulness. Please suggest some skills I can use instead or a way to claw back some trust in the skills I was using? Thank you",

    "selftext": "hey all, I'm working on a DEARMAN script for my dbt group. I feel like I have to \"fake it\" to restrain my rage so I don't know how effective my words would be. The example I'm using is how my friends are late to our hangouts\n\n>D- We agreed to meet up at the cafe Saturday at 2pm. You didn't show up until 3pm. You texted that you were running late, but that was after 2pm and you didn't tell me when you'd show up. I waited for you to show for an hour.\n\n>E- When you're running late, I feel angry, sad, and betrayed. I stick to the time we'd agreed on, but you didn't. I feel like you don't value me or my time. Or that I'm not worth showing up on time for.\n\n>A- Could you please show up at the time we had agreed upon? Or give me notice before our agreed upon time if you're running late?\n\n>R- ?? \\[I don't know what the award would be. Like do this and I'd be in a better mood? Do this and I won't burn our bridge today? Do this because it's a decent adult human thing to do? Maybe I feel inherently unworthy of friends lol\\]\n\n>M- I'd still like you to be on time. Or give me notice way ahead of time if you're running late.\n\n>A- \\[saving this for last\\]\n\n>N- If there's a different time that works better for you, please let me know. I'm willing to work with you on how to make this work better.\\*\n\n\\*this bothers me because these friends and I would spend a good amount of time checking schedules to make sure we find a time that works for everybody. Yet no matter what time we pick, these friends show up late. I know not to do early morning because they sleep in, but in the past they were late because they were still asleep at 1pm when we were supposed to meet at 1pm. One of them has ADHD and will use that as an excuse but I've long lost patience with that. What else could I say that doesn't sacrifice my own needs? My mistake here is being too accomodating to them and I'm back to square one.\n\nwhat do you all think? any feedback is appreciated, thank you <3",

I'm married and have 2 adult children and 3 grandchildren under the age of 8. I know most people would put their husband/wife down as their rock however both my husband & daughter can be controlling and narcissistic. I hate myself for even thinking that but I have to be honest. Yesterday my therapist when explaining my rocks said \"your husband and your family members would be listed here as your rocks\"  my heart sank.  On describing how our rock should make us feel safe and something or someone we turn to when things get rough I'm just not sure if I can place them here. Both are highly triggering to me. My husband isn't a great listener, he often says the wrong things, my daughter expects too much from me and whenever we fall out she comes at me big time! Both of their antics have chipped away at me over the years, I dread messages from my daughter, I've noticed patterns in the way they both treat me and I try now not to react at all to my daughter when she kicks off. I have multiple health conditions and disabilities and both of them are insensitive to my needs, my husband doesn't listen or has very little input when I hit stormy waters, my daughter uses my grandkids against me when we argue. I feel guilt at not wanting to list them as my rocks.. I am however their rock when they hit stormy waters. This is really hard for me to even accept this let alone write it down and disclose it. Is anyone else in a similar situation where their own family are triggers? What do i list as my rock/s? I usually talk with my neighbour that I've known for over 20 years and she's always there for me as is my dad. If I turn to my daughter and husband for support it's either not listened to or at some point thrown back at me during any arguments.  Any advice is appreciated. \n\nHelen x",

    "selftext": "I'm new to using the DBT skills workbook, but have a DBT therapist. I will be discussing this with my therapist as well but wanted some insight. \n\nWhen I think about radically accepting something, it makes me very uncomfortable, physically and mentally. I want to fight against it with every fiber of my being.\n\nAn example would be, I do not like that I need to be in therapy to feel stable. I have tried going without therapy but feel best when I am in therapy, and have been the last 10 years. When I am not seeing a therapist, my irrational thoughts tend to spiral and I find myself bottling up my emotions. \n\nFrom my understanding, radical acceptance in this scenario would be: I have the ability to change my therapist (who I love), how/where I see my therapist, if I attend my appointments, seeking outside help for additional support. I have the ability to at the very least try to take a step back and use different coping skills to not bottle up my emotions and challenge my irrational thoughts. I think that gives a lot of power to me, which is calming. \n\nThat being said, it makes me very uncomfortable. I still do not like that I feel like I need to see a therapist. I find myself asking why I can't just \"be normal\". I know that there are tons of reasons that anyone might see a therapist, but somehow it is \"wrong\" that I see one.\n\nTo radically accept these concepts is challenging my beliefs and I'm not sure how to deal with that. It is very very difficult for me to...accept that and I don't like feeling uncomfortable. I do everything in my power to not feel uncomfortable so the idea that its okay to sit in the uncomfortableness and be present in the moment feels gross. \n\nCurious if anyone has this experience and what they do about the uncomfortableness. I guess I can acknowledge that it feels wrong and still use it as a skill. ",

It's a 24/7 visual condition that has no explanation, no treatment or cure, and is only recently getting acceptance at being a real condition (many professionals previously disbelieved that this condition was more than made-up symptoms). This condition warps your visual reality, causing palinopsia (afterimages), visual artifacts and constant visual distortion. I can't turn it off.\n\nFor someone that hasn't had to live with this for 20-30 years and one day now has this as a new reality, what are steps that can be taken to radically accept that this is the new reality? Many sufferers of VSS struggle with depersonalization as reality itself doesn't feel real (it can be like a constant drug trip). I think acceptance can help create a new reality, but literally how? I've been struggling with this for over two months now and I'll ping pong between acceptance and looking for a solution/analyzing my mistakes. The times when I'm looking at my mistakes feel awful, I hate the symptoms and I'm not sure how to get away from hating them. \n\nI'm looking for tips and ways I can reframe this in my head to come to acceptance, or at least some knowledge that it is normal to struggle with this.

She is very inconsistent with following through on things she said she was going to do. This can be simple stuff (eg. run errands, do stuff around the house) or more challenging things (consistently \"doing the work\" on herself, doing stuff for our child, organizing date nights for us (we take turns doing this)).   \n\n\nI've tried multiple times in multiple situations using the DEARMAN script and explaining how I feel and how it affects my trust in her when she tells me that she is going to do something and then doesn't. I've tried doing the problem solving/brainstorming part of \"opposite action\" worksheet with her. Every time things change for a bit and then slowly go back to her being inconsistent. I've tried to understand the \"why\" behind her behaviour (she has ADHD which I think significantly impacts her ability to be organized and consistent).  I don't know what to do. Using \"check the facts\" I can see that she has made some progress in the 4 years since we moved in together (we've been married for 2 years), she is somewhat more organized and consistent. But this still is a huge area of hurt and broken trust for me.   \n\n\nI've reflected on what is the \"threat\" and \"catastrophe\" as per check the facts. I've tried radical acceptance. I've tried to step back and look at the big picture; we have a lot of good things in our relationship together and she has brought a lot of joy into my life. But I really struggle with trusting her and not feeling hurt and dismissed every time something else comes up that she hasn't followed through on. I feel trapped between radical acceptance as it just seems like having to put up with this (because I can't change her) vs. I've exhausted all the DBT relational skills I know and the only option left seems to be to leave her. Neither of these seem like good options. I don't think she's malicious and I do think that she loves me and I want to make this work with her but I also don't know what to do bc I feel sad/lonely/angry quite often. ",

    "selftext": "Please delete if this is not appropriate to the sub.  I've been doing DBT off and on for 5 years.  When I first started DBT, I had a great experience with two psychologists who were certified through Behavioral Tech. The group sessions were obviously centered around skills work, and the individual sessions were, too.  But there was still room in the individual sessions for me to talk about past trauma, especially complex trauma from childhood, as part of my difficulty with feeling securely attached to other people.  \n\nI've tried two new therapists (LCSW's) in the past year, both also certified through Behavioral Tech, but the difference in focus from my earlier experience has been notable. Both recent therapists talk much more about themselves, both in individual and group sessions, and they've both interrupted group members (and me) to talk about themselves at multiple points.  They also don't seem nearly as prepared to talk about deeper attachment issues as my previous therapists.  Both recent therapists have exclusively emphasized skills work in individual sessions, admonishing me that the past is in the past whenever I bring up my family's history of sexual and physical violence and earlier patterns of behavior that might be relevant.  It's almost like they are treating DBT skills like blunt tools to be applied universally, rather than with a kind of psychological discretion that depends on the individual's need for them.  I've also noticed, between them, the championing of a radically-detached version of wise mind as the correct mindset in all situations, and that we should never be judging anything, or attaching to anything, or leaning more towards emotion or logical mind, even if the situation calls for us to. \n\nI know DBT has become more popularized, and that there are a lot of therapists applying the principles of DBT even if they are not certified by Behavioral Tech.  I would expect a wide range of interpretation among therapists from different backgrounds, in that instance. But I have always thought of Behavioral Tech certification as being the gold standard for DBT practitioners (especially because they tend to charge more and not accept insurance).  \n\nAdmittedly, it's been 5 years since I had that really good experience with my two previous therapists, so it is to be expected that things would have changed since then.",

I've wanted to do DBT for the longest time but couldn't due to the price. I have my final round of Student Finance coming in April but even with it, DBT is out of my price range. That is until I was recommended an online DBT Group.   \n\n\nIt was both affordable and in a group setting (At ¬£65 per 2-hour session) for a small groups support for up to 12 people.

Things I enjoy immensely always find a way to transfer from my emotions to my thoughts, and I always found it helpful towards the journey of self discovery. We have so many complex systems that work as one whole now tell me how does that not shape or personality and who we are.. So every single thing that my thoughts tell me I enjoy, is a lie? Every observation I have in the outside world where: I meet a random person and I like them and I think to myself that I really do like them, then everything I think to myself in any kind of a situation is false, and it has nothing to do with me? Even the way we write, what we write about has traces of our personality - and it comes from our thoughts.. I find it impossible to believe that our thoughts are not connected to our personality in any way. In a lot of ways they guide us towards our interests, our hobbies, our relationships, so how can none of it be apart of who we are? I'll give you an example I see something I like, then I have a thought that the thing I see looks amazing, and then that same thought produces an emotion that makes me feel good, and at the same time I discover what I like. So tell me how how the thoughts we have are not stepping stones towards ourselves.\r  \n\r  \n**I see a point in not identifying with our bad or intrusive thoughts, as a part of self-help when your in therapy... But we shouldn't discredit all our thoughts as a part of ourselves, they play an important part in forming our identity, just as our feelings and behavior. They are all interconnected**.\r  \n\r  \n**Why the phrase lacks logic if you use it as a general rule in life**:\r  \n\r  \n‚óã Before your discovered your interests and hobbies, you had an emotional feeling about a particular thing then thought to yourself \"I really like this, I want to do it again\", the emotion got translated into your thought - some parts of your thoughts helped you find your likes/dislikes and are as such - a part of you.\r  \n\r  \n‚óã Before you do most of the things in everyday life - whether make a new friend, call your current friend, make food that YOU find tasty, what do you do? You think about how good it tasted in the past and that you want to make it again. Your thoughts were again apart of YOU and what YOU like.\r  \n\r  \n‚óã When you search for a new job, and you want to find something that's aligned with your own desires and wishes, what do you do? You THINK about it and based on the THOUGHTS, and the ones you'll listen to (the ones you follow: and are again apart of YOU and your personality) will play a huge role in your life direction.\r  \n\r  \n‚óã Through a psychological test where students wrote random thoughts on a piece of paper, psychologists acquired **many traces of their personality -** just based off that, and it was mostly accurate.\r  \n\r  \n‚óã **We are not all of our thoughts but many of our thoughts tell us about who who we actually are**/they help us discover about or wants/preferences, about what we don't want and so much.\r  \n\r  \n‚óã Where we currently are in life is a place where we travelled to based on the thoughts we chose to work with.\r  \n\r  \n‚óã **Personality is a pattern of thought, feeling, and behavior, but little attention has been paid to thoughts** \\- John A. Johnson, Ph.D., a professor of psychology at Pennsylvania State University.\r  \n\r  \n‚óã A new person we like and speak to regularly makes us feel a certain type of way - then **that emotion gets transferred to our thoughts**: \"I want to go out with this person, they make me feel good about myself, I like how many simillar things we share\" - based on our thinking we pursue that interest.\r  \n\r  \nI just think that quote is false (**has some truth in when it comes to self-help or bad thoughts but is not entirely right**, - at the same time it causes me agony), and that thoughts, emotions and genetics are one of many parts that make us who we are. We have thoughts about our interests, likes, our love lives, if we didn't follow up with any of our thoughts we wouldn't develop any of the things i just mentioned.\r  \n\r  \n**Some of our thoughts tell us nothing of ourselves and are indeed intrusive, and cause nothing but harm. But a lot of them are connected to our emotions, our personality/personal tastes, our inner drives and play an equal role as many other things (emotions, genetics, family cirmustances, etc.) that play a role and give shape to what we are.**\r  \n\r  \n**Quotes from different internet sources**: \"Personalities contain the patterns of your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that make each person unique. Together, these aspects can play a role in every part of our lives, from friendships to careers, to hobbies\". \"Thoughts: The Neglected Aspect of Personality: Personality is a pattern of thought, feeling, and behavior, but little attention has been paid to thoughts. The point is that all three aspects of what textbook author David Funder (2019) called the psychological triad‚Äîthoughts, feelings, and behavior‚Äîare equally important. - John A. Johnson, Ph.D, professor of psychology\". \"Thoughts are ideas, perspectives, opinions, and beliefs that influence our emotions, actions, and habits. They can be positive or negative, and they play a significant role in shaping our personality.\"\r  \n\r  \n**I am talking about this subject from a psychological/scientific point of view, not from any kind of spiritual/philosophical way of thinking**.\r  \n\r  \nAre some of our thoughts part of our personality, our genetic makeup and our nature? Do they play a role in shaping personality? Do they tell us something about our values, beliefs, and bottom line: ourselves? I feel like thoughts/thought patterns, emotions, genetics, etc... All play equal role in shaping who we are (our personality).\r  \n\nP.S.: I am not saying it is not beneficial to separate ourselves from our thoughts when they negative, or trying to convey my opinion as the only right one. What I am saying is that this quote on its own negates thoughts as a part of our functioning as human beings.\n\r  \nI will be feel grateful if you can help me in any way with your answer (in showing me how/if) our thoughts are part of our personality and ourselves and play a role in shaping our uniqueness as humans and also guide us towards certain directions in life (interests, hidden talents, romantic inquiry, etc. if we decide to act on them).

    "title": "DBT for ASD: Does, and if so, how does the approach work to address emotional dysregulation for people on the autism spectrum? eager for your responses and critical feedback",
    "selftext": "Hi all, I attended an intense brainstorming session recently about topics in DBT with some regional experts on the topic and I had to write an essay (not for publication in any journal, not for personal promotion of any kind, just to enhance my own understanding) based on what I heard about its utility in improving the lives of this with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), which apparently is receiving more academic attention these past years. I have ASD and have been interested in how DBT could be used to address emotional dysregulation I feel from time to time. I realize the Autism spectrum is very wide so there will invariably be variation among ASD individuals when it comes to DBT working. \n\nDisclaimer: I am NOT an expert on DBT (You'll probably see me show a very limited understanding of the key concepts, but I am doing my best to learn) and I realize the people on this subreddit are NOT mental health professionals (neither am I) but I really do want to hear from those who have used DBT first-hand if they think, based on what they know about ASD or heard from others, whether what I am saying makes sense. These are my thoughts and my thoughts alone, based on my life experiences and based on what the experts I spoke to said. Here goes a shortened version, please give as much critical feedback as you can/like: \n\n ....................................................................................................................................................\n\nDBT presumes that emotional dysregulation is primarily rooted in learned patterns of maladaptive thinking and behavioral responses. However, in ASD, emotional dysregulation often stems from several neurophysiological factors (for example Alexithymia: Difficulties identifying and labeling emotions can contribute to emotional outbursts that appear disproportionate or irrational, yet are driven by an inability to express underlying distress effectively)\n\nThe data shows DBT works well for some mental conditions (BPD, suicidality due to mood disorders, Addictions etc) but not for many with ASD. This is because ASD patients¬†¬†don‚Äôt experience emotional dysregulation in the way the DBT framework assumes everyone can: DBT heavily relies on abstract concepts like \"mindfulness\" and \"emotional states.\" These can be less accessible to individuals with ASD who often struggle with literal interpretations and concrete thinking.\n\nRigidity and Black-and-White Thinking: A core feature of ASD, this makes embracing seemingly contradictory ideas difficult. The DBT concept of \"wise mind\" (integrating seemingly opposing truths) can be particularly challenging to ASD people.\n\nDBT's distress tolerance skills aim to manage intense emotions in the moment. However, for individuals with ASD, the trigger for anger (sensory overload, social overwhelm) may not be readily modifiable in the immediate situation.¬†¬†DBT skills might offer only very limited relief in these scenarios. The concept of Radical Acceptance is also problematic because it teaches people on the spectrum that cannot change and control their environment, which feels paralyzing to them as they have strong perpetual visions of changing their environment, (in my case often).  ASD is often associated with rigid, black-and-white thinking. Radical acceptance asks individuals to embrace the reality that pain and discomfort are part of life, a concept that may be difficult to grasp for those with more literal thinking styles.  Moreover, while many ASD individuals indeed experience intense emotions this often comes with a heightened sensitivity to perceived injustice or unfairness. Radical acceptance could be misconstrued as giving up on addressing these concerns ‚Äì further causing distress or a sense of resignation. \n\nI‚Äôve seen research papers suggesting tweaking DBT into a game linked to an ASD person‚Äôs specific interests:¬†¬†While visuals and gamification can increase engagement, they don't address the core challenges of ASD, such as difficulties with abstract thinking and emotional identification.\n\nI‚Äôve also seen research abstracts where they‚Äôre devising clinical trials to see if secondary issues due to ASD such as suicidality and occasional problematic and violent behaviors can be mitigated through DBT.¬†In fact, in this use case I see the potential for counter productivity: Many individuals with ASD experience heightened sensitivity to internal and external stimuli which causes problematic behavior and a feeling of being trapped. Traditional mindfulness practice (key to DBT), with its emphasis on focusing on bodily sensations and breath, could inadvertently trigger sensory overload and increase anxiety rather than offer calmness.\n\nLet‚Äôs see if one day there will be replicated results of many reputable studies investigating using DBT in ASD. My hunch is DBT might work for some people (maybe for those on the spectrum with comorbidities like a mood disorder) but I remain skeptical.\n\nWhat am I missing? How can DBT be integrated into managing ASD? \n\n&#x200B;",

One handout we've come across is the act opposite for shame, and guilt. My partner is struggling to using any of the four options as many of his behaviours he feels justify both shame and guilt, there isn't a helpful little chart for that though, just when one or neither is justified. Is there another worksheet or handout that covers this? Have we completely misinterpreted the sheet? I've attached them for you to peruse at your own pleasure.\n\nFor a little more context, the particular topic we were discussing in depth was his tendency to lie and gaslight. He feels guilty for gaslighting me, but also feels a lot of shame around it, so he is stuck on which opposite action he should pick. In fairness to him, he has come far enough that he can even admit to this behaviour and recognise and name it, this conversation wouldn't have happened a few months ago so I have every faith in him he can change. \n\nAny help, suggestions, personal anecdotes or clarifications are much appreciated!

Having witnessed just how many people drop out, more people in my skills group dropped out than completed the 12 months, and experienced how brutally painful DBT can be, I really am proud of myself.\n\nI thought I knew a lot about DBT when I started, but I really knew nothing about the 1:1 therapy side. I certainly had no idea just how much pain I had inside. Add into, in the time I have been doing DBT, I have had some huge life changes. I was diagnosed with autism and ADHD, and had my world shifted more then once. It also almost seems fitting that as DBT ends, my whole life is changing again.\n\nIt's taken the entire 12 months to get me to a point of really accepting and choosing to use the skills. I think I needed to get full circle to 'get' it, but I also think there was an element of demand avoidance too. It really is my choice whether I keep using my skills or not, and that difference is key for me. \n\nSo yeah, just wanted to shout loud and proud. My therapist said she was really proud of the progress I've made and how much I've changed, but so much of that is down to the unrelenting support she always gave me. She has always been 100% in my corner, in a way no one else in my life has ever been, and that has meant everything to me. ",

Usually no matter what they say, I just don‚Äôt feel understood, I don‚Äôt feel heard, I get frustrated and angry and start to scream at them very quickly.\n\nToday I was triggered by an anxious thought, I told about it to my mom, and she was trying to comfort me. I quickly felt like I wanted to scream at her for every word that she said, and when I recognized it, I just screamed ‚ÄúI‚Äôm angry!‚Äù, and went to my room.\n\nMy mom came after me to the room, and I was fuming, I screamed ‚Äúgo away!!!‚Äù. She was worried and didn‚Äôt want to go, so again I screamed ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to be angry and scream at you, so let me relax and leave my room!‚Äù.\n\nWhen she left, I initiated my distress plan I prepared. First I threw socks on my bed for a few minutes until I was completely exhausted. Then I did a mindfulness session that I pre recorded (specifically it‚Äôs the ‚Äúfocus on a single object‚Äù one from the workbook). And then I washed my face with cold water.\n\nIt took about 15-20 minutes this whole thing, and at the end I was completely relaxed. I went and gave a hug to my mom and cried for a few minutes with her.\n\nThis is a complete win for me, even though I did yell at my mom and couldn‚Äôt contain myself 100%, it‚Äôs still a million times better than the nasty things I wanted to scream at her, and that I usually do.",

I don't have the money for a gym membership so I'm looking for other ideas for intense exercise that I can do at home. I have an exercise bike and small hand weights.

One conclusion is that this means there isn't enough information, and maybe more information needs to be gathered before 'change interpretations to fit the facts'. I'm interested to see what others think about this.\n\nAnother question is: it is SO subjective whether a feeling is proportionate or not. The appropriateness of an emotion I find is easier to ascertain. But whether or not your feeling is proportionate - you can ask 10 people sometimes and come up with 10 wildly different answers whether a feeling is proportionate or not.

The IOP would be quicker and a similar price to doing the comprehensive for six months, and even cheaper than doing the comprehensive for one year.\n\nI‚Äôm leaning toward the IOP- I consider myself blessed to be able to do it time wise because I‚Äôm a freelance artist I can schedule work around the IOP.

    "title": "Concerned about DBT",
    "selftext": "Hello, I am a first time poster here and wanted to get your opinions. I am about to start DBT therapy for the first time and I was doing some reading up on what it's like and I came across concepts like \"withdrawal of warmth\" and \"24 hour rule\" and it made me worry that DBT might actually trigger me more, or worst case scenario, almost be re-traumatising. \n\nSo I initially started therapy to work through the childhood trauma caused by my parent's emotional neglect (and some physical/emotional abuse). My parent's are unable to healthily manage their emotions, so they were also unable to teach child me to process and regulate my feelings too. They would also be warm/cold to me depending on their moods. Obviously this made child me very upset, and with no healthy way to handle my feelings, I would explode. Every time I had an emotional outburst, it resulted in swift and severe punishment. Eventually I realized that in order to get warmth and kindness from my parents, I needed to to bottle up my emotions, be quiet, and obey. I am now obessed with \"being good\" and not causing people around me problems. \n\nThe reason I am now starting DBT is because I was getting very disregulated in sessions with my therapist. We were working on my trauma, when parental transference got in the way. My viewing them as a parent figure hadn't been an issue until we got into a misunderstanding that caused a rupture. I felt that I had lost the connection that had made me feel safe and secure in our theraputic relationship, and I started to panic. I tried to \"be good\" by apologizing and obeying. At the same time trying to calmly and clearly explain why I was feeling and acting the way I was; but the fear and pain was causing me to get very upset and \"explode\" into crying spells and panic attacks. The good news is that I never lashed out in anger. Because of that my therapist has offered to let me come back to her after I have completed DBT and can stay emotionally regulated. Obviously this is very important to my healing, but my inner child does feel like I am again being punished for my feelings (I logically understand that is not what's happening)\n\nSo with all that in mind you can kind of see how I am afraid of DBT potentially re-creating the dynamic of needing to comply and contain in order to stay safe. Does anyone here have a similar background? Did it bring this up for you? I genuinely don't know much about the process, so good or bad, I'd like to know how it went for you.",

But then I work through the rest of the checking the facts, I'm really struggling with each step. Feeling sad because you want to die and you suck at it, etc, I don't understand how I then look at other possible interpretations, I don't know what other points of view there are. Same with working out if I'm assuming a threat, I don't know, me I guess? \n\nAll this is doing is really stressing me out and making me cry and feel so much worse because I feel like a failure that I still can't understand it.\n\nI'll add I am autistic and I think that makes understanding these skills a lot harder.",

    "selftext": "\n\n\nOn New Year's Eve, coincidentally my father's birthday, things were going well until he became intoxicated, using profanity and behaving recklessly. Despite decades of discussions about his drinking problem, it persists. While he has improved over his lifetime. When he drinks alcohol it changes who he is, and being almost 20 weeks pregnant makes me hesitant about bringing a child into a world where my father acts like a child himself. Contemplating distancing myself further and minimizing contact throughout the year, unlike my understanding brother, I struggle to accept his behavior due to past traumas. Recognizing this avoidance pattern, I'm seeking advice on enhancing my well-being in this challenging situation.\n\nNote: Even if I address my father about his poor behavior, he's unlikely to change; he's set in his ways. Observing my brother's understanding and forgiveness, despite enduring childhood trauma caused by our father, highlights a contrast. And making me wonder if I‚Äôm handling things wrong, which in turn is making me question myself as a mother-to-be. While I thought I had moved past those issues, my fathers behavior still triggers and upsets me. It might be more of a personal challenge for me than a problem with him.\n\nOn New Year's Day, I approached him to address my discomfort with what happened, intending to take a step back with how often I visit. I felt the need to voice my concerns openly. However, it didn't go as planned. \n\nThe interaction unfolded like this: as I walked down the stairs, he remained silent. Time passed, my husband appeared, and he asked him how he was doing. Later, to start the conversation, I pointed out that he hadn't asked me how I was doing. He responded with profuse apologies without really answering my question, to which I said I didn't need apologies but tried to proceed with discussing his behavior from the previous night. He defensively claimed he did nothing wrong and stormed off before I could finish my thoughts. \n\nNow my husband is telling me I was too upset/petty and I shouldn‚Äôt have started the conversation by saying ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not going to ask me how I am‚Äù. And if I‚Äôm honest I‚Äôve told him all about all my childhood traumas but he doesn‚Äôt understand it, so it‚Äôs a really lonely feeling right now. \n\nI feel like I‚Äôm truly alone. And I need to figure this out my self and I have no support. Either they tell me I‚Äôm too upset (even though I‚Äôm speaking calmly/not swearing), too angry, too opinionated. Im constantly hearing excuses for my father‚Äôs bad behaviour. \n\nAt this point I‚Äôm not going back to my parents while he‚Äôs there. Seeking perspectives or thoughts.",

Your emotions may make you act without thinking. The STOP skill allows us to regain control in these times of crisis. West World uses analysis mode multiple times. The key take aways from analysis mode are that the hosts stops, takes deep calm breathes, prevents their emotions from impacting their actions and accesses the facts of the situation.

I wanna start healing now, starting with that fight. It was a huge fight and since I haven't healthily felt and released my feelings, they keep on resurfacing and hurting me and causing more fights. It's extremely harmful.\n\nHowever, whenever I sit down to feel these emotions, they are just out of my reach. It's like I'm physically unable to feel these emotions. They're ever present at the back of my mind but the moment I confront them, they'll flee. Maybe because I have a certain level of distress intolerance. But I can't shove these emotions down anymore because this is causing me a lot of chronic anxiety, as if something is stuck in my chest. Any tips on how I can face these feelings without subconsciously shutting them down?",

    "selftext": "Hi, I am a DBT beginner looking for help with skills I should practice in this situation. \n\nSomeone I love very much and live with is indicating they‚Äôre upset with me (avoiding me, not responding to what I say in the way they usually do, body language, etc.), but they aren‚Äôt telling me why. \n\nI asked one time a few days ago and they said ‚Äúeverything‚Äôs fine.‚Äù We (me and another person I live with) can tell it‚Äôs not. I don‚Äôt want to beg them, make assumptions, or do something else I‚Äôll regret, so I set a hard boundary for myself to ask once and then wait for them to tell me.\n\nThe problem is that I‚Äôm still feeling a lot of stress and anxiety and guilt about it. I don‚Äôt know what I did, but my mind has been going wild about the possibilities of what I did, what that means for our relationship going forward, and when/if they‚Äôre going to tell me. \n\nWhat skills should I use in this situation? I‚Äôm working on mindfulness (awareness and acceptance) with my therapist but I‚Äôm still not great at it. Also, does it seem appropriate to sit down with them and say ‚Äúcan you please tell me why you‚Äôve been acting differently towards me lately?‚Äù or something like that? Any links to skills would be appreciated too.\n\nEDIT: Thank you everyone for all the help and kindness!",

Coming back to things over and over, like OK, you were a powerless child, it wasn't your responsibility to change the conditions you were in, it was the responsibility of the adults around you and they didn't do the right thing and you can never change that because it's in the past. The circumstances led things to be this way and weren't in any one person's control. You have to live with the consequences and only have limited ability to change in the present, you will always be a different person because of your trauma. That's all 100% the non-judgmental truth. The past is the past, it wasn't my fault, it has a cause and is the cause of other things, and I can't change it. But... running through these thoughts over and over sounds(and feels) the same as when I find myself ruminating about the past and the pain and the injustice of it all. I'm supposed to not try to avoid these feelings but I feel like I'm just triggering myself on purpose and I don't know where to draw the line. What are some of your experiences having to accept very difficult and painful realities and how do you keep it from becoming unproductive?",

    "title": "Interpersonal Effectiveness - Challenging Myths in the Way of Objectives Effectiveness",
    "selftext": "\nThis is handout 2 in the interpersonal effectiveness module. I didn‚Äôt bother posting the first because it‚Äôs just a simple introduction to interpersonal effectiveness, which i will cover here. \n\nFirst, the goals of mastering Interpersonal Effectiveness, are to become skillful in getting what you want and need from others, to be assertive and confident, to say no to unwanted requests easily, to get others to take your opinions seriously, to build harmonious relationships, to repair relationships when needed, to learn effective conflict resolution skills and if necessary to end unhealthy destructive relationships and to set and follow healthy boundaries. \n\nWorksheet/Handout 2 teaches us to first become aware of any negative thoughts/beliefs that prevent us from having effective interpersonal skills. \n\nSo check out the worksheets/handouts. \n\nOn the worksheet, challenge (counteract) each common myth with a healthier statement or a positive affirmation. \n\nExamples: \n\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt deserve to get what I want or need. It‚Äôs rude to be assertive. Saying no to people is selfish. It‚Äôs good to be self sacrificing. Pleasing others is more of a priority than my own needs. I shouldn‚Äôt prioritize my needs because they don‚Äôt matter. Making requests is too pushy/selfish.‚Äù \n\nThese are common negative thoughts/beliefs that ‚Äúpeople pleasers‚Äù have, which cause ineffective interpersonal interactions. Because if you believe your needs are unimportant, you won‚Äôt be assertive, confident and won‚Äôt stand up for yourself, will be a ‚Äúpush over‚Äù, you won‚Äôt be able to say no, and often times will neglect your own needs so much that it‚Äôs detrimental to your health. \n\nTo counteract these negative beliefs you could affirm ‚ÄúI deserve to get what I want. I am important. My needs are important. I have the right to ask for what I need. It is not selfish to prioritize my own needs. I allow others to make their own decisions. I give them the freedom to grow and learn their own lessons.‚Äù Feel free to think of your own positive affirmations. \n\n‚ÄúAsking for help is a sign of weakness. I must be inadequate if I can‚Äôt do it myself.‚Äù\n\nCounteract with: ‚ÄúAll people have different weaknesses and strengths. Healthy communities thrive from helping each other. It‚Äôs a strength to ask for help. It helps others to give them the opportunity to help. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with asking for help.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúI shouldn‚Äôt have to ask, they should just know and do it. They‚Äôre a bad person for not living up to my expectations. I don‚Äôt have to be kind or polite because they don‚Äôt do enough for me. I shouldn‚Äôt have to work or negotiate to get what I want.‚Äù\n\nHaving assumptions about why people behave the way they do is only going to lead to terrible outcomes in communication. ‚ÄúWhen you assume, it makes an ass out of you and me.‚Äù\nFor example, when you assume someone isn‚Äôt helping you clean the dishes because they‚Äôre lazy/intentionally hurting you, it‚Äôs only going to lead to conflict. Instead counteract with, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt actually know why this person isn‚Äôt helping me, so I will just ask them to help instead of assuming and reacting. Sometimes people just really don‚Äôt know what I want. They aren‚Äôt mind readers. They may have been raised differently and just don‚Äôt know any better but I can teach them how to behave towards me if I remain calm and ask for what I need.‚Äù",

The concepts make sense, but the way they are presented in group really rub me the wrong way and I am wondering if staying in group is a good use of my time. I don‚Äôt have BPD. I have long lasting depression and anxiety, and have had periods of existential depression leading to thoughts of self harm. \n\nThis group is led by doctoral psychology students, not licensed therapists, so it is cheaper and more accessible. I know the facilitators are trying, but the worksheets and slides they present (it‚Äôs a Zoom class) feel so formulaic and patronizing and weird to me. \n\nI‚Äôm trying not to judge, but each week feels like a slog to sit through. I get distracted, I don‚Äôt want to be sitting there on my computer on an evening after work. No one is talking about their actual problems because we‚Äôre not allowed to be triggering, which I understand, but the examples used in the class feel so unrelatable. \n\nI‚Äôm wondering if a self-guided book or podcast might present the material in a way that works better for me, since I am really not feeling good about the group. It leaves me feeling frustrated, and because it‚Äôs a group in a set time, I don‚Äôt have time to ask all the questions I want and relate it to my real issues and get feedback. I get that the group is not all about me, that‚Äôs why I like individual therapy because I can really take all the time I need to make it about my issues and needs. \n\nPart of me wants to stick with it, but the 4 weeks I‚Äôve been to so far feel so crappy.

    "selftext": "The therapist I was assigned is brand new, this is her first job working with adults. And that's fine, everyone has to start somewhere but it took a lot of strength for me to finally access mental health care and now I'm stuck with a therapist I don't really care for. \n\nIt's not just that she's new that bugs me. She seems judgemental. I'll give one very very small example. I told her how COVID basically destroyed my life and I haven't been able to return to my pre-covid self. She said \"yeah, I don't like calling it this but I feel COVID made a lot of people \"lazy\"'. Girl you basically just called me lazy while I'm pouring my heart and trauma out to you. That's just one tiny example and it's not the worst. \n\nShe doesn't seem to have an understanding of neurodivergence. I am autistic. \n\nIdk. I could go on forever but I won't. I LOVED the therapist that did my intake. I wish she was my individual therapist. I have 2 meetings/week. One is individual therapy, the other is group therapy. I find myself dreading the individual therapy. I don't feel comfortable opening up to her and I don't trust her criticism. The woman who did my intake - I would trust her criticism. Idk how to explain it, my current therapist just isn't a good fit for me and I'm so disappointed. \n\nI was super excited to start DBT and now I'm kinda wanting to jump ship. Are there any therapists here? How can I kindly ask for a new therapist?\n\nI made my first appointment with my individual therapist in-person. After that, it's all been virtual. I've met with her 4 times because I wanted to give her a chance and she's just not fitting my needs. I know she is overworked and stressed but I don't want to be her guinea pig. I am severely fucked up and am finally getting therapy. Ugh\n\nAnyways. Advice?",

    "title": "Struggling with two things in regard to DBT.",
    "selftext": "Hi guys. Thanks for your time. I'm living in the UK, and have had CBT and counselling. I found that neither of those were helpful. DBT is, but my only option to self administer. I've already noticed that distress is much easier to tolerate, I'm more mindful, etc. It's nice.\n\nHowever - there are certain things I'm struggling with, and dont know what skills to apply to combat. These are two things.\n\nThe first of which is the awareness of futility, and fear of the future. I am painfully aware of the fact that tomorrow, my entire family could die, or I could face brutal abuse, and no amount of therapy skills could help me. Frankly, the world can be a horrible and cruel place, and it makes any amount of self improvement feel almost counterintuitive, and as though as the smart solution is to...Off yourself. I won't, I'm just aware of this thought pattern, and I think it impacts my commitment to the treatment.\n\nThe second is my struggle in identifying which of my interpersonal needs are valid, and which may be unfair. For example - my boyfriend and I had a fight last night because I felt as though he never listens to me (I was showing him YouTube videos, and he rolled over and groaned). Objectively very rude - but what degree of response is warranted? Or the time I got upset with him over something I completely made up in my head, and was quite unpleasant about? In the moment - how do you distinguish, find, and calmly communicate your own fair needs as a person from mental illness symptoms when they often feel identical?",

    "title": "Seeking new tools to help with passive ‚Äòburden‚Äô thought types",
    "selftext": "So I‚Äôm struggling with passive suicidal ideation, I suppose, in the form of: I don‚Äôt want to commit, and have no plan to, and never would, but I always sort of find myself wishing I had never come into existence or that something would take me out. \n\nRight now, I‚Äôm facing a lot of issues that revolve around finances and feeling like a burden. For some background, I live with endometriosis, EDS, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Depression that comes and goes, and ADHD. My brain tends toward a bit of OCD and possibly some light autism overlap regarding symptoms, as well.\nNeedless to say, my whole life I have spent finding ways to improve my mental and physical health, and I have found tons of ways to cope and help- I‚Äôve been to therapy plenty of periods of my life, I take several medications that help my symptoms. I‚Äôve learned loads through philosophy, dialectical thinking, cognitive behavioral therapy, value retraining, meditation, awareness practices, being kind to myself, recognizing my efforts. But I think I also know that a lot of the things I struggle with aren‚Äôt fixable, which can sometimes even help me lend myself some grace! \n\nBut the fact still remains and is becoming harder to ignore that, I don‚Äôt think I can support myself. No matter how hard I try and how well I‚Äôm managing, the setup of my brain just does not seem to be compatible with the expectations of society. Sure I have value as a person, and I think I have a lot to offer others when it comes to sharing insights and connection. But that doesn‚Äôt feel like enough, when that isn‚Äôt valued in the world I‚Äôm forced to live in. It doesn‚Äôt change the fact that I, as an individual, am currently unable to (and for the foreseeable future,) conform to the requirements needed to support myself. Just baseline housing, and food, insurances, medications, hygiene maintenance. I cannot consistently work and generate enough income.\n\nEveryone always says that ‚Äúyou deserve to live just by existing. You‚Äôre enough as you are, you‚Äôre allowed to be imperfect, people want you here anyway, your mind‚Äôs standards are probably unrealistically high, etc.‚Äù \n\nI don‚Äôt know how to reconcile these concepts with the brutal reality that, every single month, every single day, I have to burden others with my care, or. I don‚Äôt know, die? It sort of seems like that‚Äôs what society wants me to do. There‚Äôs no kind of support that could be applied to me, so it really comes down to just me. And that seems to match the way of the world- animals feed themselves, or die. It‚Äôs the baseline requirement of ‚Äúbeing enough,‚Äù of ‚Äúdeserving‚Äù to live. You *have* to keep yourself alive, maintain your body, maintain shelter for yourself. Or you die.\n\nI can‚Äôt live with myself forcing others to take care of my needs on top of their own. I KNOW how hard it is just to take care of oneself. Hell, it‚Äôs not even necessarily an option when my loved ones are struggling just as hard for themselves and barely making ends meet. Even if they ‚Äòloved me *while* being willing to accept that extra burden,‚Äô that doesn‚Äôt even mean that they CAN carry that extra load.\n\nIt‚Äôs even worse knowing that people you love don‚Äôt necessarily understand why you can‚Äôt take care of yourself, because both your efforts and struggles are invisible to them; Things that are easier for them might take absolutely everything I have, and then they wonder if I really am trying as hard as I can or if I‚Äôm lazy, uncaring, maybe truly less valuable as a person. \n\n\nI‚Äôm not enough. My efforts aren‚Äôt enough. It‚Äôs just plain fact. It might not even be my fault, or anyone‚Äôs fault; and there could even be a set of circumstances in which maybe I was enough, but I don‚Äôt have access to them. So the fact remains. As I am, which I cannot change, in the circumstances I was born into, which I cannot change, I am at my very best efforts am not able to do enough to justify my own continuation based on the requirements placed on me, which once more, I cannot change. \nAnd how can you feel like you deserve to live when you have such obvious evidence that you don‚Äôt deserve to? That you might have value, but it‚Äôs not the right, needed kind? That that value isn‚Äôt enough to justify your burden to others, to society, to life‚Äôs requirements. I just don‚Äôt have the power to, no matter how much I might want to, to live in this world, in this body.\n\n\nSo what the hell can I do about it?? Does anyone relate to this, does anyone have any tools to fight these feelings or this reality?? I‚Äôm trying not to give up, and just feeling the hopelessness and powerlessness creep in harder and harder the more time goes on. I need something new to try, to think, to anything, to try and learn and stay here, because these feelings are becoming unbearable. I might not have an inkling on how to start fighting it, but maybe, just maybe, someone else out there has an idea that could help me. It wouldn‚Äôt be the first time by a long shot that I thought I had run out of ways to fix my shit ass brain‚Äôs will to live, only to reach out and search and find people with some more last ditch efforts to try and stay alive.",

    "selftext": "I'm starting my second trip through the book in group therapy, and this week we covered Pros and Cons. This was one of the first skills I learned, and one that really produced results for me, and I've been thinking more about it lately.\n\nI think the signle most important part of this skill  is the devil's advocate side of the chart- the part where you ask what you gain from doing the \"bad\" behavior or the risks and drawbacks of doing the \"good\" behavior.\n\nCuz like, nobody wants to admit they want to do the \"bad\" thing, you're not supposed to own sin in our culture. So of course there isn't part of me that doesn't want to lose weight, that would be crazy and irrational, haha. But, there is- and we need to radically accept that. Whether you want to see it as Jung's Shadow, a burdened Exile as IFS might call it, your Inner Child, it has reasons for wanting the \"bad\" thing, and those are important strike points for changing the behavior.\n\nIf you ask this part of you why it's pushing you to stay stuck, you might find an underlying need you're trying to meet by doing that. The need might be valid, like a need to feel loved, and then you can find some other way to provide that for yourself which isn't self-destructive. Or the need might be invalid, like a need to feel safe when you already are safe; and then it's about distress tolerance, reframing judgements, or just opposite action if that works, until you can really feel like that need is being met. If you integrate the other side of the argument and disarm those reasons, then you won't be fighting yourself to act skillfully anymore.",

    "selftext": "Hi. Just to give some background. I have been going through some DBT workbook, and it has helped me quite a lot, especially in terms if distress tolerance and in general with regulating my emotions, but what it seems is lacking (and maybe this is not in scope of DBT at all) is some very practical tips on how to do actionable things for a change. \n\nLet me explain - what I have come to conclude in the last year or so, is that pretty much I‚Äôm addicted to certainty. And I would like to emphasize exactly ‚Äúaddiction to certainty‚Äù as opposed to ‚Äúfear of uncertainty‚Äù as we all experience the fear if uncertainty to some degree, but a lot of people can take the leap even if they have that fear. Addiction to certainty is when you find short term pleasure in avoiding uncertainty but it‚Äôs killing you slowly as any drug would. It goes across the board - I turn down good job offers because of fear of the unknown, I struggle approaching women to meet them because of thinking I will be ridiculed (I‚Äôm a man myself, and have been in relationships but they have fallen on me somehow on the flow), I‚Äôm afraid to be confrontational because I want just everything to be peaceful as it is, I lack courage to start my own business because I‚Äôm not sure what will happen. These are just some small set of examples. Some of these things are lifelong (the women and the confrontational part), some of them are just lately (like the job and business thing, as 5 years ago I changed my career without hesitations, sometimes I think I have some trauma from the pandemic as it was a very shaky time so in a sense having a PTSD from it).\n\nAnyway, would like to hear similar stories and how some of you overcame this addiction to certainty, with or without the help of DBT and if with help of DBT, which tools did you use and how to facilitate change in your life and remove this fear of uncertainty?

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm a 30M looking to start a DBT program soon. I have difficulty regulating my emotions. I'm skeptical, but DBT seems like it could be somewhat helpful. I've been in the process of finding DBT care. I have already selected a group, but I need to choose a provider. I'm really struggling with a lot of indecision. This is going to be a long, very expensive commitment, so I feel a lot of pressure to \"get it right\". I know no one can tell me which option will be better in the long term or make the decision for me, so I'm looking for some guidance on what things to look for in a therapist and what things are important when choosing one.\n\nI'm between two therapists, both of whom I've met with 3-4 times now. Everyone I've spoken to that's familiar with DBT stresses how important the patient-therapist relationship is. But it's hard for me to pick because it's based almost entirely on gut feelings and vibes - not facts. And the therapist's treatment styles seem quite different.\n\nHere's a quick run down of the two.\n\n**Therapist #1**\n\n* They have a PsyD from Rutgers and trained under one of Marsha Linehan's direct students.\n* They worked at McLean's DBT programs before graduate school.\n* They're more expensive ($300), but I may also get reimbursed more from my insurance than Therapist #2.\n* They're quieter and more reserved.\n* Their style reminds me of the \"passive observer\" that I'm used to from psychodynamic therapy.\n* Their style of therapy feels more familiar to me. This is both comforting and worrying. On the one hand, I feel like I know what to expect, and that's reassuring. On the other hand, psychodynamic therapy has never really worked for me, so I'm concerned it'll feel like more of the same.\n* They feels really professional. It feels like I'm in good hands.\n* But I still have doubts, for some reason. I think, primarily, because their style reminds me so much of previous therapists.\n\n**Therapist #2**\n\n* They have an LICSW.\n* They have worked at McLean's DBT programs for 9 years.\n* They're less expensive ($250), but I may also get reimbursed less from my insurance than Therapist #1.\n* They have a more active, engaged, and directive style.\n* They feel more informal. I don't like the words \"less professional\", but they feel less distant/unapproachable, if that makes any sense. But that also worries me. It kind of makes me feel like I'm in less good hands because I associate that air of \"professionalism\" with expertise and competency.\n* Their style feels really different than anything I've experienced before. This is refreshing, and it makes it feel like DBT is going to be this novel, exciting thing instead of more of the same disappointing therapy.\n   * But that also makes it feel risky. I have no basis or prior experience for how this might go.\n* I am doing the group with them.\n* They may go on a 3 month leave in the next year. They agreed to see me in their private practice if that were to occur, so there would be no disruption to individual therapy, but I worry they wouldn't be able to give her their attention to their work.\n\nBecause it's so early, I haven't really had any real discussions about my issues with either. They're both waiting for the group to start and for me to choose between them. We haven't gotten into anything challenging yet, so it's hard to compare them. I feel like I've picked up little useful nuggets from both in that time. My therapist friend says this is a good problem to have - it's clear that I am in good hands either way. Either option is likely to benefit me. But I still find myself worrying about which to pick and trying to control the outcome of this therapy by overthinking the choice.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice to unblock my decision making? Thank you so much.",

    "selftext": "Hello beautiful people, I recently discovered that I have a personality disorder. My psychiatrist said she was not going to focus on the actual diagnosis other than for insurance purposes, because she really doesn‚Äôt like ‚Äúlabels‚Äú\n\nShe said it‚Äôs more important to focus on the treatment and therapy for which she only and highly recommended DBT. I am six hours into treatment, and my therapist has told me several times to stop trying to take shortcuts. She‚Äôs asked me to be patient with treatment as it‚Äôs a very long-term goal.\n\nMy biggest fear is that I might end up like my mother who also had the same mental health issues and because she never sought treatment she did end up taking her life. I don‚Äôt really feel like I am heading towards that way, but I‚Äôm scared that it may come that way in the future\n\nSo my question is what are some tips to learn how to be but also how to be comfortable with being patient with my treatment and therapy and healing journey. \n\nObviously I want to get better as fast as possible and for me I guess that looks like in the form of trying to take shortcuts. So I don‚Äôt want to do that anymore. I want to do what‚Äôs right and most effective.\n\nThank you in advance and I‚Äôm super glad to have such a large support community already .",

    "selftext": "I'm a secular humanist, which means I don't have any religion and I don't believe in anything spiritual at all. DBT has elements of spirituality in some of its skills that I struggled with figuring out what to do with when I first went through comprehensive DBT. None of the facilitators were equipped to deal with someone who didn't believe in any gods or supernatural beings or universal energy or anything like that. I eventually figured out how to approach some of these skills from a purely secular perspective. These are the things I wish I had known when I first was going through DBT.\n\nI'm going to use the IMPROVE skill as the example. The P stands for Prayer. Of all the references to spirituality in DBT this is the one that I struggled with the most. I think what I figured out for this one is applicable to the other references to spirituality as well.\n\nWhen I peel back the underlying idea of the examples of the Prayer skill in the DBT Handbook, I noticed that it's about surrendering the desire to control everything. It's letting go of fighting reality acceptance. It helps spiritual folks to do those things if combine the surrendering and the letting go with surrendering to whatever the higher powers they believe in and accepting whatever plans or control they think those powers have over their lives. This same letting go and surrendering control can be done completely secularly. But it will look different based on what works for different folks.\n\nMy personal approach is to embrace the transience of the universe. I revisit my memories of this documentary I watched of these monks who create elaborate, colorful sand mandalas and then destroy them. I think about the creativity people put into pumpkin carving every October even though they'll rot in less than a week. I think about when people buy a bouquet of flowers and water them every day until they wilt.\n\nIronically, thinking about these beautiful things coming to an end brings my SUDS down. It reminds me that the bad things are just as temporary. That life is still worth living even though all good things come to an end. It helps me let go of trying to fight reality. To surrender the desire to control the things I can't control. That is my prayer.\n\nI hope some of these things can be helpful if any of y'all also don't have any spiritual beliefs. Even if you do have spiritual beliefs, I think that the secular way of approaching the Prayer skill can work alongside whatever other ways you've found the skill useful. If it's not for you, then that's fine too.",

    "title": "DBT is fully compatible with political activism",
    "selftext": "I will try to keep this away from advocating a specific political position. However, I have heard in many spaces that one of the problems with therapy is that it encourages you to seek individual solutions to societal problems. Some folks are disregulated more because of things in society that they feel need to change, rather than personal problems. Therapy, according to these people's thinking, is suppressing political activism.\n\nI agree that this is probably true for some therapeutic modalities. And I have experienced DBT therapists who, in my opinion, do treat DBT in this way. However, I think DBT is compatible with political activism. Primarily with the combination of 3 skills: Check the Facts, Radical Acceptance, and Problem Solving.\n\nIf you are disregulated then that makes it more difficult to effectively participate in political activism. Before you can get to that step, you need to bring your SUDS down. Check the Facts identifies whether your emotion OR intensity OR duration fits the facts. It's a common misconception that Check the Facts is supposed to tell you why your emotions are wrong so that you can move onto the next step of Opposite Action. Check the Facts can help you identify that your emotions are justified (i.e. fit the facts) but the intensity is not. Or it can help you identify that your emotions and the intensity and the duration is justified. If that's the case, then Opposite Action is not going to be effective. It's not a given that if you Check the Facts then it will reveal how you're wrong to have negative emotions about a situation. If a societal problem is making you scared or angry or sad and your Wise Mind is telling you that those feelings fit the facts, then DBT will not tell you that you are wrong.\n\nCheck the Facts has 6 steps of things to identify: the emotion, the facts of the prompting event, the interpretations, the threats, the catastrophe (i.e. the worst threat), and finally if the emotion/intensity fits the facts. I want to focus on the 5th step of identifying the catastrophe and how Radical Acceptance can come into play here. Identifying the catastrophe involves describing the worst outcome that can *reasonably* how and then vividly and specifically imagining coping with the catastrophe. If the prompting event of the target emotion is a societal problem, then the catastrophe is probably society continuing to go down that path with even more vigor. These sorts of massive catastrophic situations can be difficult to figure out what you could use to cope. That's where Radical Acceptance can help. As Marsha has said, Radical Acceptance is not love, passivity, or against change. Radical Acceptance is accepting the facts of reality, the limitations of the future, that everything has a cause, and that life is worth living. None of that contradicts taking political action. In fact, it can be activating to completely and totally accept the facts. Acknowledging the limitations of the future can help you understand the ways in which the future is *not* limited. Accepting that everything has a cause can give clarity of purpose. Accepting that life is worth living can give you hope. You need these things to effectively take political action.\n\nOnce you have completed all 6 steps of Check the Facts, if your Wise Mind is telling you that your emotions/intensity do fit the facts, then *do not* do Opposite Action. It will be more effective to use the Problem Solving skill instead. Going through the steps of Problem Solving is where you can brainstorm and *act* on the political things you want to affect. With the reality acceptance, you will have a clearer picture of what is within your control and what is outside your control. You can work on the problems you can solve, while accepting that you can't do everything yourself overnight. If what you try to accomplish doesn't happen, then you can use reality acceptance to prevent the pain from turning into suffering. And then you can try something else. You can take action without it getting your SUDS up or, if that can't be managed, then without your SUDS staying high for a long duration. It will help reduce burnout and disregulation.\n\nI hope this doesn't sound like I'm pressuring people to be politically active. I wanted to write this to give hope to the folks who have spoken up about how they think therapy is overly individualistic and as an example of how using multiple skills from different modules can work together.",

For context, I have been going to (and will continue to go) to therapy for the past few months. My therapist has been great and I feel like I have made some progress. One issue that has been holding me back has been fully understanding concepts like \"mindfulness\" and \"acceptance (of my past and my present)\". This concepts I classify them as really abstract and have not been able to grasp them which has me in a bit of a rut in my progress. I have shared this whit my therapist and we are working on it, but no matter how much I read up on this concepts I can't actually get them to stick. I can understand what they mean but, ultimately this feeling is best described for me in the following way \"it's like looking at a piece of art and understanding all the themes and the message it shows, but not being able to feel any of it\". I understand that my explanation of the issue at hand might not be the best, but I thank you all for any insight you may provide!",

For example, I tend to avoid eating (especially breakfast) because anxiety messes with my appetite in a big way. But by avoiding doing it, the anxiety increases and it gets harder (and I'm missing the \"E\" in PLEASE!). So I definitely understand *why* I should just do the thing, but I still don't do the thing. \n\nI tend to think of it as \"forcing\" myself to do things, which introduces a lot of potential for self judgement and shame, which never helps either.

That's why it's so important for us to get input. I'm grateful when J points out an error or something I'm forgetting. I remember examples from last week.\n\nThere is this other thing that happens. J interrupts in a high pressure moment not because I missed something, but because \\*he\\* has fallen behind. Objects to something I'm doing because \\*he\\* doesn't know the mechanics. Stops what I'm doing to suggest a wrong course of action. Others react poorly but I'm the only one who snaps and vents at him. I have to stop it.\n\nI need to have a talk with J. But what's the right framework? I was imagining I should acknowledge that he doesn't deserve my anger, that I value his backup. But I also have to set boundaries, or I'm just counting on my own willpower to change things.

It all depends, it's easy when i'm not tired and in a good mood and difficult when i'm tired..etc\n\nFor example,\n\nA.I was calling my gf(things were difficult at the time) and she told me she would call me back in 5 mins cuz she was upset, and she didn't and she said she's taking a shower in 15 mins and I waited for 15 more minutes, she came back.\n\nI was okay at first and asked her why she didn't tell me earlier.. i would've been okay.. stuff and i felt like she kept making excuses and I ended up getting annoyed by her facial expressions(maybe it was juust in my head) i started getting upset\n\nAnd the conversation went on and on.. I ended up yelling and she was so sick of me doing this shit just hung up.\n\nB. Another one, we argued over a stupid thing(I tend to argue easily and make problems a lot and don't let them go) and I kept pushing her saying you have to understand what i'm saying... etc.  \nWe argued a lot that time(we are in ldr so it was when i was visiting her country) so we were very sensitive already and tired. And I was standing somewhere I don't know and she said she was sick of our arguments and she was going home and told me to figure out what to do here.(It happened twice while I was in her country this time and the first time was when i caught her using tinder.. it's complicated) As soon as i saw her walking away from me, i was reminded of the first time she was leaving me behind, i got extremely angry, followed her and grabbed her arms violently and stepped on her foot.\n\nI am NEVER trying to justify my actions. It's just the context. and I know I'm really horrible..\n\nSo first example(A)  \nI knew I was okay and it could be an argument but as soon as i saw her facial expression change and tone, even tho i thought about STOP, I didn't use it. I was just thinking \"why should i be nice and be a bigger person to her? Look at her and her face, she's not even trying, I should attack her more.\" And kept arguing. And it went so bad of course.\n\nThe second one too.(B)  \nthe moment she was leaving I knew i had to stop. I shouldn't just follow and should stop and thin  \nbut i was thinking(being extremely angry) \"why? she's a fucking cheater and she dared to leave me saying it's my responsibility coming all the way here whether she cheated or not, and she's leaving again over a stupid argument without trying to even talk, I should attack more..\"\n\nIt's always like that. I wrote only two examples but I made SO MANY stupid arguments that could've been nothing to other people. And yet I deal with all of them like somebody is trying to kill me and i'm trying to attack them back with all my life. I don't know what to do with this willfullness\n\nSometimes it's managable sometimes it's impossible. I know i have to use STOP and others but i just don't use it. I feel really stupid. I even got physical and I never want to do it ever again. This anger issue had been killing me over the last 10 years and I finally thought i started seeing some hopes this year since i found DBT but I feel like a huge failure again. I don't want to hurt others... really\n\nOne more thing. My therapist told me i need to at least once HANG Up the phone when things start looking bad(Ldr) with STOP skill. But to be honest, I have never in my life hung up the phone when things are bad. I've been always so stubborn and fought until one of us decides to block or we both lose our all energy to talk more. I'm that stubborn :(\n\nPlease help me with any tips. Thank you.. hope you understand i'm taking my issue very seriously and feeling so much guilt",

    "selftext": "So I've got this issue called affective alexithymia. Probably had it my whole life, associated with autism spectrum. Basically, I don't get all those cool little signals people normally get from their body telling them what emotion they're dealing with at the moment. Pressure and heat and cold and pulse changes and in particular parts of the body. I get all the same emotions everyone else does, and they affect me e.g. behavior, mood, body language even... but I can easily be the last person in the room to know about it until it causes a problem for me. AND I still have to deal with ineffective action urges from them.\n\nThat's a problem for a lot of reasons, but this week it's a problem because my group is on Emotion Regulation Handout 21/Worksheet 15: Mindfulness of Current Emotions, which kind of depends on this aspect of interoception being functional.\n\nSo I take a deep breath and sing a song(my best mindfulness tool) and once I've gotten 'logic mind' to chill out, I ask myself  the big question; what are you feeling right now and why. And I let my mind be still and I sit and try to feel the answer rather than think of one. I still just get that resounding silence I'm used to. So I have to work backwards from the action urge- ok, I'm avoiding something I want to do, so that's anxiety. Or reverse empathy- if someone else were in that situation I'd expect them to feel jealous, so that's probably what's going on. Well where is it? I don't know. Where does it come from? I don't know. When does it come and go? I don't get to know that.\n\nHow do I do any of the anthropomorphizing the book suggests like respecting and loving my feeling when it, metaphorically, refuses to be in the same room with me?",

He has outright told me, \"you need to get more friends.\" But he does like me and values my friendship and wants to keep the relationship. \n\nBut I'm very introverted and have severe social anxiety so it's really hard for me to connect with people in a meaningful way. And it takes time for me to build a deep relationship. \n\nI think I need to just go NC but I am scared. He's the only really good friend I have and even though it's causing me distress, I will have nobody at all if I lose him ‚Äî not literally but it is how it feels, like my other relationships are not strong enough to bear the weight of my illness. \n\nI'm sad to think about a future without him, and I think it's very likely that losing him would just mean I would isolate even more. \n\nI'm working with my therapist to try to outline a way to take a break from him, but even that terrifies me, the notion of not being able to contact him for a month or whatever feels devastating. He's the best friend I've ever had in my entire life and I'll be lost without him.\n\nI'm in torment every moment I'm awake and can't stop crying about him. \n\nWhat DBT skills can help me get through this? It's been a while since I did DBT and I've lost a lot of the knowledge. üòî",

So far I've found the skills to be very common sense based and a lot of which I do implement already, but what I am finding difficult is that when I can tell I'm being sucked down into the depths, I lose all want to be better. Even at my best I really am only willing to put in the effort for other people and slightly because I myself want to feel better. And so when im actively heading downwards all willingness goes out the window pretty quick.\n\nI know being willing is pretty much the entire point of DBT with mindfulness, accepting reality, and not being willful. So I'm really struggling to know what I'm supposed to do when I'm so far from wanting to implement skills or do even the smallest ammount of effort to help myself. Its not even that I'm feeling undeserving or anything like that, it's fully because it feels like way too much work, and I'm tried of trying all the time. I'd much rather give up on myself and give into the shitty though processes, behaviors, and urges. Even though I know it obviously wouldn't do me or anyone else any good that doesn't matter. The ultimate goal is to die anyway (when I'm doing bad and am very not willing to help myself). \n\nSo I'm seriously struggling right now to have any want to make anything better or okayish. All that's giving me even the slightest bit of willingness is not wanting to emotionally hurt other people by giving into everything, and by all means that's keeping me going, but only so much and for only so long. \n\nI know that I have to be willing in order for anything to change, but I'm kinda stuck on this step. And it's kind of annoying how easily I can use the skills and understand them, but because I'm barely willing to want things to be different even when I do utilise them it barely helps this pit in my soul.",

My target behaviour/negative coping mechanisms are maladaptive dreaming, binge eating and oversleeping. Instead of doing any of those, I tried to sit with the feelings (for 10 minutes), and then tried to do some self-soothing methods (read affirmations, cried, tried to imagine my therapist's voice saying 'it's ok, it's ok). I then tried to do IMPROVE, and decided to go for a walk despite feeling extremely sad/depressed and not wanting to do anything.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI managed to walk for 1 mile, all the while feeling intense anxiety/sadness/like something is 'wrong'. I tried to use STOP a few times, but the feelings did not decrease. I also tried to do mindfullness, and tried to notice plants, the sky, but I was too distressed to be mindful. I had planned a 5 mile walk but ended up walking back, so I managed a 2 mile walk.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBecause of all this, I felt like \"I already tried my very best to use skills, WHY am I not even feeling even a little better?\". In fact I honestly felt even worse. Had I just stayed home and resigned to one of my unhealthy coping behaviours, I would 'at least feel better for a few moments' (but feel worse in the long run). This makes me feel like I don't trust the skills, like they're useless for me at times and makes me feel demotivated. Can anyone relate/give any advice?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Was majorly triggered, tried to use STOP, Feel the feelings, self-sooth, IMPROVE, mindfulness. None worked, in fact having tried my best to use skills and failing to feel any better made me frustrated and demotivated/don't trust DBT skills. Can anyone relate/give any advice?",

I've found some mostly effective ways to get a few reasonable meals & snacks daily, and some days are better than others. Still, it's a lot of struggle to experience multiple times a day, without an option to take a break from the exposure. Plus, it sucks that one of my PLEASE skills is a pain point, that makes other ones harder!

    "selftext": "Hi All,\n\nI feel disappointed with my DBT therapist. I've been seeing here for half a year now. She is good with coaching calls, she correctly identifies the DBT skills I need and the worksheets to use, however, there is no depth. I don't think she conceptualizes her cases and I noticed she does not have very good knowledge of attachment issues and relational trauma. For example, I got triggered about something she did in therapy and I felt unsafe and mistrustful. We talked about it, I told her the skills I used and that I still couldn't reduced the intensity of the emotional trigger. She then suggested maybe I should try using ice and then she was asking me if maybe this is related to my family. I said of course it is. She was asking me some obvious questions and I said \"You tell me about it!\" I really felt like that is her job.\n\nI am really feeling disappointed. She is OK when it comes to the DBT skills but nothing beyond that. I don't think she can make a connection between things, and she does not see patterns. It's pretty flat. Perhaps it's because she is new to DBT maybe only a year.\n\nI used to have a very good psychologist who knew things without even me telling him. He is very expensive though and only private pay.\n\nLast week, I saw an EMDR therapist that specializes in attachment and complex trauma. I did not have to fill intake papers and no intake session. I went to her office and withing 15 minutes she already made some very insightful observations and even helped me with some EMDR processing. That night, I cried because I felt seen and understood after a long time.\n\nNow, I don't know what to do with my DBT therapist. Should I try to tell her I am disappointed with therapy? Should, I try working on the relationship, although, I cannot teach her about attachment trauma? Should, I just quit DTB therapy and go with the EMDR therapist?\n\nThank you,  \nNikola",

Together it‚Äôs a toxic mess between us. Part of this seems to be due to the different approaches professionals have taken with us individually. I‚Äôve been on the DBT train since then (loving it), but I‚Äôve noticed she has become more of a black-and-white mindset. I don‚Äôt know if this is because of her therapy or my awareness of it. My struggle is that we both still seem to want the relationship, but it makes it difficult for me to be involved with her (and my kids) due to this mindset. We talked briefly about how we seemed to be getting taught the opposite kinds of therapy a few months back. It‚Äôs made things around parenting extremely difficult. I‚Äôve tried to take the judgemental ‚Äúabsolutes‚Äù or concepts that she wants from me and look for the skills that apply to that concept. (e.g. accountability = Fast). This still has made things difficult for us to repair our relationship and work together for our kids. For example, she applies past situations as if they are consistently happening in the present, and will happen again in the future.\n\nPlease forgive me if this question is unclear, but has anyone else had this relationship dynamic with someone? How do you work with someone who has such an absolute view of the world when going through a change of the opposite?",

    "title": "Struggling to find 'a life worth living'",
    "selftext": "So I have been doing DBT for almost 6 months now, and I'm finding that I am going round and round in circles. I feel as though I have one foot quite firmly in DBT, committed, wanted to change and have that dream 'life worth living', but the other foot is very firmly not, and keeps falling back to k illing myself, etc.\n\nI think one of the issues is I find 'a life worth living' such a tricky concept. Not only does it feel really wanky and preachy, but it is also a concept I am just not familiar with. I'm autistic and so I struggle to envision things I've not experienced before, and I don't think I've ever truly be happy, not long term or for a sustained period, and if I have, I don't remember it. Due to this, I find it really hard to envision a life worth living for myself because I just do not know what that looks like. I don't know what a life I value would include. \n\nI know what I want to do for a career, and I'm ambitious and know I want to do well, and I know I want to travel the world, but other than that I don't know what I would want my life to look like if I envisioned one where I was happy. It makes me really sad to think I can't even imagine what happiness looks like to me. \n\nI am also really aware that a big part of the problem I am facing right now, of having one foot in, one foot out, is fear. Deep down inside I am scared of life. I'm scared of living and not being happy, but also scared of living AND being happy. I'm scared of failing, at anything, of not being enough, or being too much.  I'm scared of being alone forever, but also subjecting a partner to, well... me.\n\nI just feel stuck, so stuck. And scared. And trapped. And that trapped feeling is the most dangerous for me as that's what sets off the dangerous thoughts and the actions that go with it.\n\nSorry for such a long post, if you've read this far, thank you. If anyone has any advice, or can relate at all, I'd love to hear it because right now I feel so alone and clueless as to what to do. Also, please bare in mind I'm autistic, so please be as clear as possible, or at least patient with me if I ask you to explain your point, as I often misunderstand people - thank you.",

    "title": "Reflections on Doing DBT Alone & Finishing the Mindfulness Module",
    "selftext": "Hello, everyone! \n\n&#x200B;\n\ntldr: I just finished covering the Mindfulness section on my own and wanted to share some reflections. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI decided to go through Marsha Linehan's DBT Workbook (2nd ed) by myself mid-February this year. It was prompted by a breakup, which was partly caused by my lack of emotion regulation skills. Before the breakup, I dipped my toes into the workbook here and there without ever committing to go through it systematically or daily. Working through the workbook on my own has become a nice self-development project of some sort, and it's been great. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's the schedule I set up for myself: \n\n* mid-Feb to June: learn the basics of the DBT & cover the mindfulness module. \n* July to September: Cover the emotion regulation module.\n* October to December:  Cover the distress tolerance module\n* January 2024 to March 2024: Cover the interpersonal effectiveness module\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo be honest, setting up the schedule this way might not be for everyone. Linehan notes in the Training Manual that it's generally not a good idea to spend many weeks for one module because some people may dislike a particular module (e.g., I'm dreading to cover the interpersonal effectiveness module), and staying in the module that you don't like for a long time may cause the loss of motivation. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat being said, though, I find 13 weeks to be also kind of not enough to thoroughly cover each module? Each module contains so much information and learning, so I kind of found no space to take a break even though I was taking 13 weeks to go through the Mindfulness module. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor materials, I bought the following publications by Linehan: \n\n* Cognitive-Behavioral Treatment of Borderline Personality \n* DBT Skills Training Manual Second Edition\n* DBT¬Æ Skills Training Handouts and Worksheets, Second Edition Second Edition\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI bought the first book because I wanted to do the deepest dive into the DBT, but it was not that helpful, to be honest. The first section where Linehan presents the bio-social theory and various causes of BPD was informative but also triggering. The section about sexual abuse, invalidating environment, etc. reminded me so much of my painful upbringing, but I also think it was worth pushing through and reading them. I wanted to understand myself better. It's a very technical, academic book, and I'm an academic, so I enjoyed her clear, scientific writing, but it might not be for everyone. \n\nThe part about therapist-client relationship wasn't all that relevant for me since I'm doing DBT on my own, but Linehan does talk about therapy-interfering behaviors \\*on the part of the therapist\\* and I thought that section taught me what kind of therapists to avoid. She essentially gives a list of therapist red flags, so I thought that was helpful. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe second book (Training Manual) was so worth the money!!! And if you're doing DBT alone, I'd highly recommend buying the training manual. The beginning part provides a lot of basic theories behind DBT and a sample DBT program schedule. I skipped the parts about how to manage the therapist-client relationships, the DBT group dynamics, etc. The latter 2/3 of the book contains detailed explanations for each DBT concept, handout and worksheet, and I found them SO VALUABLE! I want to thank the person on this sub who recommended me to buy the Training Manual a while ago!!! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome reflections after going through the mindfulness module: \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI thought the mindfulness module was SUPER HELPFUL, and, according to the Training Manual, the observe & describe skills as well as being one-mindful and non-judgmental are necessary for the emotion regulation skills, so I'm glad that I was able to cover them well before moving onto the emotion regulation module. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPracticing mindfulness almost everyday definitely changed my life. I feel less depressed, and I started paying more attention to what's going on in my life and living in the present moment as it is, so to speak. Loving Kindness Meditation especially normalized expressing compassion to myself, which I wasn't used to, and I plan to do it everyday for the rest of my life. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt was also fun to do many mindfulness activities and to figure out what works well for me vs doesn't work well for me. For instance, I'm not a big fan of the stone flake meditation but I really like the staircase meditation. I think one big benefit of the workbook offering so many activities is that it gives you an arsenal of mindfulness toolkits and help you figure out what works well for you. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne worry I have about the mindfulness module is that it might not be for neurodivergent folks. I know someone who has ADHD, and he tells me he really struggles with meditation, etc., so for neurodivergent people, they might have to do some additional research/ reading to figure out ways to practice mindfulness. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne final thought: while mindfulness is SO tremendously helpful, I also noticed that it's not a solution for everything. For instance, while I was covering the mindfulness module, I had a conflict with a friend of mine and got kind of verbally aggressive, which I regret and apologized for. The conflict reminded me that I need to learn emotional regulation and interpersonal effectiveness skills. So, I'm excited to move onto the emotion regulation module and learn more. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope this post was helpful for those who are looking to start DBT on their own! \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

During the last 6 months we've changed instructors 3 times.\n\nThe first one was extremely aggressive and would constantly argue with some members for not doing their homework or showing up late (making them publicly apologize or kicking them out of the virtual room for that day). He was my individual therapist too and I was on the verge of leaving the clinic, but then he got fired so I guess it worked out. \n\nThe second was the most monotone instructor I've had since first year of college. She was the opposite of the first one and just read the book for the entirety of the hour. She never motivated us to do our homework and eventually it got to the point where I was the only one doing them, so I stopped. She didn't get fired but stopped giving group the days I was scheduled. \n\nThe new guy is nice. He's extremely shy and goes off on tangents when he uses his own life as examples because no one is speaking. Again, no one is doing their homework and he's not really urging us to participate either. I would talk in the beginning, but eventually stopped when I realized no one was listening or simply had their cameras off.\n\nGroup lately has been feeling like a huge waste of time, but I don't miss it to avoid the fee. I also can't stop going since it's required to remain in individual therapy with the clinic (and I really like my new therapist). \n\nAre there any online resources for DBT? As in courses or online groups that can be out-of-state. I'm going to keep attending my current group but it might as well not be a thing since I'm getting absolutely nothing out of it.",

I meditate daily and it really does help, but I know there's more out there I could be learning.\n\nI'm speaking with someone about an intensive 3-month program to learn more about that option, but I'm curious to hear folks' experiences with the 24-month skills class (plus weekly therapy) approach. I like that the intensive program would have continuity between the classes and the individual therapy portions, but it does seem like a LOT for my particular situation. I'd also have to go part-time at work for three months, and I'm very lucky to have a supportive work environment for something like that, but I'm also just not sure it's the right fit.\n\nI guess I'm mostly wondering, if you did the long version of the program, did you find yourself wishing for more support or structure, or did you feel like that was enough? \n\nThank you!",

I'm glad this works for so many people. At this point I am just going to try and do the bare minimum to survive the week (the crisis line here is run by the same company and their in patient hospitals have already traumatized and failed me enough as it is, I'm not willing to call and risk having to endure that again). \n\nMy current therapist wants me to join the local DBT group. Unfortunately due to being unable to reliably read print in the last DBT group I was in, I‚Äôm kind of traumatized from the experience and very hesitant to even consider the group. I know DBT can work for me after being part of a research project, but that was a very focused, one on one setup with things tailored to work with a blind person. My current mental health place is not able to do that for me and I‚Äôm way past having the spoons to do it for them. \n\nI figure at least a few people here must have print disabilities of some kind as well.

    "selftext": "I‚Äôm recently separated and I have two toddlers. My s/o and I do want some sort of romantic relationship but our individual mental health and her busy schedule gets in the way. I can‚Äôt use the dbt skills to end the relationship as she‚Äôs the mother of my kids and we‚Äôve both been pretty involved parents. We generally don‚Äôt argue when it comes to actual parenting but we can‚Äôt seem to get the fundamental parts of a basic social relationship right. For example, most of the discussions get out of hand when discussing acknowledgment, validation etc which seem to happen when I use Fast. She has ideas that don‚Äôt quite align with dbt and I‚Äôm happy for her to operate within them, just not expect me to agree. If I don‚Äôt use fast, everything is fine. My boundaries are pretty aligned within dbt and I try to stick within them, so it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm asking for her to take on some sort of support role in my therapy. when I try to use fast, I get told I‚Äôm being threatening, avoiding accountability or generally intense. I don‚Äôt expect her to follow or know anything about dbt, just respect that is how my behaviour is aligned and what to expect. A lot is being misunderstood and not been given a chance to clarify. These arguments are affecting both of our behaviour and I can see why but I can‚Äôt seem to communicate effectively how she is asking for me to do things that are detrimental to my self respect. It‚Äôs met with a lot of judgement and invalidation of how I feel, think or experience things. Has anyone had a similar situation and how would you deal with a relationship that you can‚Äôt just stop engaging with?",

I am currently abstaining from cannabis.\n\nSo, the post it notes correspond with Urge Surfing. Green is for 5 minutes, yellow for 15min, pink for 1 hr.

Here is what happened:  \n\n\n1. I had a session two weeks ago and based on her suggestion we agreed I will keep track of my judgments. For example where I judge people etc. I followed through with this and wrote in my diary cards judgemental thoughts. For example, \"A person was wearing a horrible trashy t-shirt\".\n2. She canceled last week's session which is why it has been two weeks since our last session.\n3. I had a session this Monday and at the start of the session as she reads my cards and goes over the judgments I wrote in the cards she is saying \"Sounds like you need to work on non-judgment\". I told her I wrote them because she asked me to last session. She just said she forgot and then we did not do anything about those notes.\n\nThis is a common thing with her and I feel frustrated. I wrote this therapy-interfering behavior in my cards and I that we need to address it by keeping track of action items in a shared Google doc. I wrote that this is a deal breaker for me because I feel disrespected and like she is wasting my time by asking me to do something and then not following through.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wonder what is your experience with therapists following or not following up with things from one session to another.",

    "title": "DBT Skills for When A Friend Has Hurt You?",
    "selftext": "Hi. My best friend and I made plans this weekend for my birthday to see the Mario movie and have a sleepover. However, she is currently going through a very recent, very messy breakup with her boyfriend, and the three of us were very close. On Monday, she said she didn‚Äôt think we could hang this weekend and she would need some space. I felt sad, but I understood.\n\nLast night. I found out she went to see the movie with another friend that was pretty non mutual with the boyfriend, or at least not as associated in the relationship. I am heartbroken. She has always been an amazing friend and I was so blindsided by this. I talked to someone about it. They think that she just isn‚Äôt thinking because she has so much running through her mind and on her plate with this nasty breakup, or that maybe it is just easier to hang out with someone who doesn‚Äôt remind her of the boyfriend. Everyone thinks she just needs time and space and it wasn‚Äôt a purposeful, malicious thing. But I‚Äôve had toxic friendships before, so I‚Äôm extremely angry, hurt, heartbroken. She is also my FP. \n\nI know people aren‚Äôt perfect. I know people screw up or don‚Äôt think, especially in times like a breakup. She has never, ever done something like this before, which is why I don‚Äôt want to give up on the friendship. I understand that I am a bit of a reminder of the relationship and she just needs time. She always said that even though she may need time and space, I‚Äôll never lose her as my friend. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm so lost now. \n\nWhat skills can I use to process this hurt? I just keep crying and not sleeping and it‚Äôs making my family extremely concerned. What DBT skills can I use to craft a message to send her about this (when things are less stressful for both of us.) \n\nI want to keep this friendship. She‚Äôs never given me reason to think she‚Äôs a bad friend before this. But I know it‚Äôs something that needs to be addressed eventually.",

I never realized, before starting this therapy, how often and how much I've been cruel to myself, how often I have had negative judgments. Wise mind helps me tremendously in dealing with anxiety about future events, and beginner's mind helps me in times when I need to do something which has been clouded by past bad experiences. Integrating compassion, kindness and empathy, helps both before dealing with certain people, but also afterward to a certain degree, if something ends up upsetting me.\n\nI'm working with the book slowly and thoroughly, and as I'm only at the beginning of the emotion regulation chapter, and I didn't even touch the interpersonal effectiveness chapter, I'm worried about leaping into much more challenging social situations and encountering family, friends and acquaintances who have known the version of me prior to the start of therapy. I realize that I need to expose myself to challenging situations in order to grow, but I'm afraid if it goes horribly wrong, I will end up in a worse state than before starting therapy? How did you deal with similar situations? Have you ever had a significant setback to your progress because you tried to do too much too soon?",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI've been seeing my therapist for 9 months now, and we have been working with DBT, and it has been really helpful. One of the main reasons I started therapy was my rocky relationship with my father, which I later came to realize it was a lot more due to my own preconceptions and fears than actual evidence that he was mad at me. I've been doing well at school and work, I feel motivated, I love my friends, but my love life and the way I deal with it is something I'm struggling to improve on. I talked to my therapsit about it and we've been working on this, but I thought it would be nice to broaden the conversation and maybe get some tips and skills from you guys! My main issue is that, due to a sense of abandonment, I tend to create expectations a little too early and set myself up for heartbreak, but even that has been improving after my sessions. The problem now is: I usually see other as competitors in the \"love game\" and that makes me anxious and demotivated. I am a 21 years old bissexual man, but most of my romantic/sexual interestes are towards men. I live withing a mostly gay/bi friend group, and since we are all single, it's very hard for me to stop thoughts of competitiveness towards them. I'm very confident in my personality, but not nearly as confident with my looks. I always think that because my friends are skinnier than me, have better hair, behave better with their bodies than I do, that they are \"winning the game\". This gets worse when someone else shows interest (even just sexual) on someone I've been trying to \"seduce\" (hate that word lol) or when someone I'm into shows interest in my friends. I think I'm gonna lose them and that I will always be the ugly duckling from my friend group. My friends are mostly white, skinny and conventionally attractive, and even though I understand I'm far from being \"conventionally ugly\", I know that in a superficial level they attract more people than I do, which causes me to feel like a failure sometimes.

My whole body was vibrating in fear and I felt totally helpless. \n\nThe plane didn‚Äôt crash, but was redirected 300 miles south and grounded for 12 hours. We were all ok, but I‚Äôm struggling with how to process any of this. People are horrified on my behalf, but I feel like I‚Äôm struggling with validating myself - after all, other than a few bruises, I came out totally unscathed physically. But my body feels like it‚Äôs holding onto that fear. I find myself trembling, sometimes violently and uncontrollably if I‚Äôm especially stressed or cold. My throat feels tight and it feels like the ground is moving beneath my feet. \n\nI would like DBT tips (or any tips, really) on how to process this in a way that hopefully both honors my emotions while soothing the huge fear that I‚Äôm feeling, so I can better move on.",

I used the SMART skill to make a plan to visit the local game shop to see if there were any groups playing DND nearby. Sadly for me, the groups are all online, and my internet is too lousy to play online. Then, I decided to make a new Facebook account (since my old one got hacked, and I can't get back into it) to see if there are any events happening locally I could attend to meet some people. Sadly again, everything is too far away or it's a Bible study (which doesn't appeal to me).

First, I am angry that the internet at my mom's house where I am living is so lousy. My mom has complained to our internet provider several times. All they tell her is, \"It looks good on our end,\" and they never fix it. My mom tried reporting them to the BBB over it, and they must have found out it was her. This happened before I moved back home, but she said they shut off her internet for two weeks over it. We can't get another internet service provider, because the house is on a county line, and no one else will give us internet where we live. My step dad refuses to let us try satellite internet as an alternative. I could rant more about why we need better internet, but I'll leave it at that. \n\nThen, there's the fact that I'm unemployed, and my social skills are garbage. There's nothing to do around here apparently. I feel like I don't stand a chance at making any new friends and that I'm doomed to be lonely. I'm grateful for the friends I do have, don't get me wrong. They're wonderful to me.

    "selftext": "Hi all, thanks for reading. A minor Trigger Warning for stigma against BPD, perhaps. (Sorry!)\n\nI'm really struggling quite a bit with a diagnosis that I don't have yet. It's a long story, but at 32 years old, I'm considering Borderline Personality Disorder for the first time. My therapist says I have \"some borderline traits\" but she doesn't want to make the diagnosis. I've been searching for the better part of a year to try to get an assessment of some sort, I don't really know how - but my new psychiatrist says that she can diagnose me if I want.\n\nI'm not ready. I don't feel like I can handle it. My only coping strategy for the past 16 months (since I've been considering it) has been denial. It's easy enough to convince myself a lot of the time. Most of my symptoms are pretty \"quiet\" so a few people have told me that I don't act like someone with borderline personality disorder. Even now, I find myself trying to prove that I don't have it. I started doing DBT before I had ever considered BPD, and I've improved my behavior to the point that I think I don't currently exhibit 5 diagnostic criteria. But I probably did before. If I got to remission before getting diagnosed it doesn't count, right?\n\nI really, really do not want to have BPD. When I convince myself that I don't have it, I feel so good. Then I encounter some evidence that I do have it, and I spiral. I can't sleep, I can't focus at work, and I can't be pleasant to others. I just stay in my room and cry. Until I talk myself down again. Sometimes this feels like I'm using CBT and identifying cognitive distortions - surely, when I feel like I have BPD, that's just catastrophizing. But right now it feels like I do have BPD, and the rest of the time is denial. Mostly I try to live in that state of denial because it makes me a much more functional person. My therapist encourages it. She says \"maybe try to focus on the ways in which you don't fit the criteria\". I kind of think denial can even be a DBT skill for Distress Tolerance in a way - I read something about \"push away your problems away temporarily.\"\n\nI think I need to Radically Accept this, but I don't know how.\n\nI've practiced Radical Acceptance for small things. I think it has helped somewhat with anger, actually. I can use Radical Acceptance for traffic, and for misunderstandings at work, and maybe for some bigger disappointments.

I decided to designate it as my new purse. Only with this purse, I wanted to incorporate coping skills to keep my hands busy, as I am currently trying to quit vaping (I vape mostly just to have something to do with my hands). So, I filled my little purse with a small notebook (to keep track of appointments, jot down ideas, and so on), a squishy ball that I adore playing with, a bear-shaped squishy toy, a hair tie, a pop-it bracelet, and some firm putty. I'm hoping to add more things as I aquire them, as there's a little more room left in my purse! I've gotta put my wallet in there, and my earbuds are in the front compartment. \n\nAnyway, I just thought this would be a fun idea for anyone here who carries a purse. Non-purse carrying people can probably do a coping skills tote or something. \n\nEnjoy your evening!",

Just a three short sentences, not a waffling emotional train-of-thought. \n\nAppear confident: on message, not in person, so keeping it short and to the point. \n\nNegotiate: Not really relevant here.

I feel since the fight I have been extra anxious and emotional, which I‚Äôm afraid might be heavy on her.

    "selftext": "I'm super embarrassed. I just got into a 2nd car accident in as many weeks, this time it was not my fault, someone was rushing southbound across a street who I didn't see, they hit my rear left wheel. In my stupid, stupid panic and shame I got his phone number but did not take a picture of his license plate or call the police. I know, I'm an idiot, and now my family is carless.\n\nI'm feeling super guilty and don't know what skills to use. I did pros and cons for not using a target behavior so in that sense I am being skillful.\n\nI'm unmedicated for my ADD right now bc I'm pregnant and wonder if I need to be medicated since my inattention in car accidents was what led me to being diagnosed. Meds aren't recommended in pregnancy unless the individual has trouble functioning and I'm wondering if the car accidents qualify as me not functioning.\n\nMy husband is also very frustrated and mad at me that I didn't get the right info after the accident. I feel like even though the accident wasn't my fault now the whole situation is because I didn't do what I was supposed to, I feel like it was poor logic/impulse control and I'm not sure what skills to use or how to repair.",

I also recently found out that the situation I moved into? Is not as stable as I first anticipated, and will only be able to stay here for 6 months maximum. If that. \n\nI'm on the autistic spectrum so this is incredibly stressful for me. I understand it would be for most people as well. I am feeling *very* anxious and am completely unsure of my next steps. In terms of mid/long term planning. I usually latch onto any stability I can find as a way to sooth my anxiety? But have been advised not to by my therapist, and I agree with her. I've been trying opposite action and self-soothe? But to little effect. Also been working very hard to maintain PLEASE skills, which has been helpful but isn't quite as magic as I wish it were(haha).\n\nI understand that these types of changes are hard and it's probably not totally reasonable to expect myself to be well enough to do more complex planning type thinking when I'm experiencing this kind of stress? And do wish I had an extra day or two to really give myself some space. To maybe grieve skillfully or build positive experiences(can't remember full skill name)? But it's unfortunately not the situation I find myself in. I need to start trying to at least find a job asap. If not other housing solutions as well. But needing to find other housing right *now* may be just the anxiety talking. \n\nMy therapist is off for the weekend and we don't have another session till Thursday. I'm looking for any other skills that people may have used in similar situations? High stress with little breathing room combined with a need to appear as normal as possible. Or wondering if there's any little extra brain tricks people have found that are still largely in line with DBT.\n\nThanks, really appreciated.",

The response I get is stonewalling. More recently they just made eye contact and smiled; conversation over.\n\nThat's the point where I feel very triggered. I want to assert my autonomy somehow (usually in a way that doesn't benefit me in the long term). I don't, I just stuff it down and get through my day. But it's having an effect on me not being able to have any say on my workload, and those emotions aren't going anywhere. I end up feeling angry and eventually that anger makes me feel depressed and unmotivated.\n\nI understand the next step logically (when triggered) is distress tolerance. But this is a long term issue about my workload, this is where I work and these concerns are practical and I'd like to change them. But how can I change them if nobody will listen to me?\n\nI understand some of this is vague, but can anyone relate to having DEARMAN be consistently rejected? How am I meant to navigate my job with dignity if people don't respond to me being reasonable? If anyone here has had the same problem and has any advice I would greatly appreciate it!",

    "selftext": "I've had a very hard time finding a comprehensive in-person DBT program in my area that takes my insurance (or any insurance!). So far, I have completed about a year of DBT skills group through a couple different online programs. I have learned a ton through the online groups, but have not seen much improvement yet. I actually seem to have gotten worse with my relationship which is why I started DBT to begin with. I realize this is not \"full\" DBT and so I am probably not getting the potential full benefit. \n\nI finally found a nearby in-person skills group that starts in January, but it's only 12 weeks long. They also don't use the Linehan book, which gave me pause. They use **The 12-Week DBT Workbook: Practical Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills to Regain Emotional Stability by Valerie Dunn McBee**. I wondered if anyone here has used this. Also, has anyone benefitted from such a short in-person group? This won't be comprehensive DBT either since the one individual DBT therapist at this practice isn't currently accepting new clients. It's fairly reasonably priced, so I'll probably try it out. They must skip a ton of skills and go over things quickly though if it's only 12 weeks long. \n\nI did find an individual therapist somewhere else who claims she does DBT. I have my first appointment with her next week. I don't think her practice is a comprehensive DBT one either but I'm hoping she actually does practice DBT and know it well. I've had many bad experiences with individual therapists over the years and do not want to see anyone who does do DBT (or ACT but I can't find anyone here who does that).",

    "selftext": "As I've been working through the \"understanding what emotions do for you\" section of emotion regulation, something that helps me understand each emotion is to consider some important functions of that emotion. The handouts talk about how feeling emotions moves us to act, and how this can be helpful in life or death situations. \n\nSometimes emotions fit the facts and sometimes they don't, sometimes the urges they cause are helpful and sometimes they're not. But either way, it helps me to think about the instances where they do fulfil important functions. For example, anger helps us respond to valid threats, guilt and shame help modify our behaviour to be accepted by others (we're social creatures and depend on each other), fear helps us respond to risk, etc. For most of the emotions in these handouts, I can think of some pretty essential human functions that they're involved in.\n\nBut I can't make sense of this with sadness. Why do we as humans have a capacity to feel sadness? What do we need it for? I'm curious as to whether anyone else has thought about this, and whether anyone has any insights they'd like to share.\n\nI appreciate that this line of questioning goes beyond the scope of DBT.

I decided to stay in the program a few extra weeks due to the information being tremendously helpful and almost life changing. \n\nOne thing I really struggled with throughout, and now after is Radical Acceptance. \n\nMy issue isn‚Äôt being able to practice said skill, it‚Äôs my tendency to utilize it too often in situations where it probably isn‚Äôt necessary. \n\nFor example, my favorite person wants to cease a friendship and relationship with me, so I (sadly) agree and accept the situation. That person then proceeds to explain that they‚Äôre upset that I didn‚Äôt ‚Äúfight‚Äù for our interaction/relationship. I chose to shut myself off and deal with the end of a close relationship in the way I felt necessary. \n\nSo my question is there anyway to differentiate between situations where radical acceptance is necessary and where it isn‚Äôt? Particularly in social and romantic situations.",

I learned REST and some distress tolerance skills, and it was shockingly easy to stop engaging in all my destructive behavior almost immediately.\n\nThe problem is that I can‚Äôt get anything done at work. I have all these healthy coping skills, but they only work when I‚Äôm actively engaging them. On bad days, I feel a difficult emotion, I successfully use a coping skill, and I start working again - and immediately I‚Äôm overwhelmed by panic about work and have to do it again. I never get to a place of actually being able to work. I used to act on my impulses sometimes. Now I don‚Äôt. But it hasn‚Äôt helped me perform any better.\n\nAs soon as the work day is over, I feel wonderful. Almost constantly. But when I‚Äôm at work, I have constant panic attacks. Not just about work, but about everything - especially relationships.\n\nDoes this get better? Does this mean that I‚Äôve mastered Distress Tolerance but I‚Äôm not getting the Emotion Regulation part? Does that stuff really work? The distress tolerance was so easy, and the emotion regulation section just doesn‚Äôt seem to be going anywhere. Do I ever stop feeling constantly terrified? Is there a way to get myself to be productive through the panic? Is this better approached with something other than DBT?\n\nThank you for reading.",

This makes sense to me, but what about when you want to apologise an appropriate amount?\n\nDEAR MAN has a good mechanism for expressing yourself clearly, but I understand it to be more goal/outcome oriented, and that feels kinda weird for an apology yknow? \n\nI guess GIVE makes some amount of sense in that it's a useful approach to take if you're trying to make an apology, but again, it seems more focused on validation.\n\nAre there other skills that could be brought in? Maybe problem solving and check the facts? Radical acceptance?\n\nAm I just overthinking this? I'd be interested to hear others' perspectives on this.\n\nI definitely can see ways to use the existing skills so that I'm not apologising to people in ways that are manipulative, ineffective, damaging to respect, overly dramatic, etc. But I feel kinda lost as to like, an actual framework of guidance to follow. I find the step by step instructions of DBT so helpful and wish there was something like this for apologies. Maybe I need to accept that there isn't (!)\n\nWhen I did my goals and values worksheet for \"Accumulate\", I wrote that integrity was important to me, specifically, repairing harm I've caused to others and taking responsibility for my actions, but I still feel like I've got a lot to learn in order to move more in line with this value.\n\n\nEDIT: I am making this edit some good while after making the original post because I found something which may be of use in the handouts.\n\nGeneral handout 7a: Chain analysis, and general handout 8, Missing link analysis\n\nThese handouts deal with identifying problem behaviour, what chain of events led up to it, how could you be more skillful, is there anything getting in the way of skills, and in chain analysis it specifically mentions repairing consequences of problem behaviour. It doesn't go much into the repair part, but chain analysis could be an important part of understanding what happened if you have anything that needs an apology.",

I feel like I'm doing okay with emotion regulation and interpersonal skills since I'm not blowing up at my boyfriend or taking out how crappy I feel on him as I've historically done. I'd like to keep that up and resist getting carried away in my thoughts and emotions because that's when I spiral and have a total breakdown of skills. \n\nI'm noticing pretty strong urges to fight my negative emotions, though, and definitely judgment towards myself (thinking I *shouldn't* feel this way since there's no obvious reason to/the reasons are irrational) so I'm thinking radical acceptance, distraction, and self-soothing may be the best skills to use, which I'm currently trying to do. Also, I'm feeling like being alone and doing comforting, distracting things by myself is the most effective thing for me right now but that means breaking plans with my boyfriend tonight, which I feel guilty for doing.

    "title": "DBT tips for fear of falling asleep and negative \"what-if\" thinking?",
    "selftext": "This is my first ever post on Reddit and it's quite long so please bear with me!\n\n**Context:** I (F, 28) have struggled with anxiety and depression on and off for about 10 years (and also when I was a kid, from about 10-12 years old). I've taken medication, gone to therapy, and overall, I'm doing so much better than I was when I first started feeling bad. All my anxiety tends to be rooted in having control - not over other people, but myself. I hate flying, for example, because I hate feeling helpless. All that being said, nobody ever suspects I have this anxiety. I tend to be very outgoing, confident, and a good friend - it's important to me that I show up for other people, no matter how I'm feeling. My friends and family are extremely important to me, and I've been known to put their needs before my own in the past (context).\n\nAnyways, for the past few years, my anxiety has been super manageable. That is until I had a rough bout of insomnia a few months ago. I would go days without sleeping and was essentially a zombie, all while still having to work and see friends. It all built up when one day, I was so tired (I think it was day 4 of no sleep) I had a full-blown panic attack. I hadn't had a bad one in years so this was really shocking for me. Eventually, I found some ways to make myself sleep (audiobooks, chamomile tea, making my bed every morning, and making my room a safe space), but the panic attack traumatized me. I felt pretty depressed for a few weeks after but eventually got better (part of this likely has to do with getting a dog, which really helped keep my mind busy).\n\n**Now** it's been months since that panic attack, and everything in my life has been going great. I've been on vacation for the past few months visiting friends and family before starting my new job in October and ending it now on a trip to Ireland with my parents. Everything is going so well, that the other day I started thinking: \"how can everything be so perfect? why and how can I feel so happy? There must be something that will go wrong.\" Which led to...\"what if I get insomnia again and screw this vacation up?\" and \"What if I don't sleep tonight, or for another week? And then I disappoint my parents who planned this whole vacation because I'm too tired to do anything? and then I get another panic attack?\" And then I started getting nervous about the aspect of sleep and losing control. Suddenly, it freaked me out that I can't control when I fall asleep and it's just something that happens TO me. I'm supposed to just think about life and then wake up without knowing when or how? That freaks me out! And this is coming from someone who is a notoriously great sleeper, apart from a few bouts of insomnia! I can easily sleep for 14 hours no problem usually! Mind you, I have been able to sleep on this vacation and for the past few months. I go to bed nervous and thinking about it but then wake up after what feels like 1 minute when my alarm goes off. So none of my worries have actually happened, but the what-ifs make me so nervous all day and make it so I can't even really enjoy the vacation. I'm so nervous about what COULD happen I'm not even focusing on the present. This line of thinking and constant anxiety has started to make me think \"what if I get depressed again? what if that means I won't be the same fun person as before?\" I have so many events coming up (friends' wedding, friends visiting, my brother's wedding, and a trip with a guy I'm seeing), and I feel like if I get insomnia again or depressed again I'll disappoint everyone and myself.\n\nThis feels like such an inconsequential problem, and I realize that big picture, everything is fine. I just don't want to burden my parents by bringing this up and could use some tips/tricks on how you guys manage irrational fears and negative what-if scenarios that lead to spiraling. Thank you!!",

I‚Äôm going through a major depressive episode and I don‚Äôt have energy to date, so its good to have cuddles/sex with someone who I feel safe with. I enjoy being around him because his presence calms my anxiety and uplifts my mood.\n\nBut recently we haven‚Äôt hooked up as frequently, and my other coworker made a comment/joke that he might be looking for a girlfriend. \n\nI knew it would end someday. I‚Äôm glad that he‚Äôs potentially found someone. But I don‚Äôt even have confirmation about this! My mind is spiraling and catastrophizing with all these anxieties and jealous thoughts. Also I‚Äôm ignoring him because I think he‚Äôs ignoring me, so if I cut him off then it will be on my watch. Maybe this situation is all in my head and I‚Äôm reading too much into it, or maybe its real. He‚Äôs not the type of guy to explicitly say that its over so I‚Äôm not going to ask unless he asks first. I don‚Äôt see the point in it, and I‚Äôm ok with not asking. If he asked me, I would go over. \n\nI‚Äôve been writing in my journal which helps get out emotions but I still spiral. I don‚Äôt need relationship advice or answers to my anxieties, just DBT skills to cope. Any advice on skills to help get over an obsession, deal with anxieties and spiraling, trying to abandon someone before they abandon you, or anything else applicable to this story?",

Text someone I love (even just ‚ÄúI love you/hope you‚Äôre having a good day ttyl‚Äù)  \n4. Exercise - go for a run or do rowing, work up a sweat and get rid of suppressed energy and tension.¬† \n5. Shower.  \n6. Listen to ASMR  \n7. Take a few moments to distract myself with thoughts, calming and imaginative.  \n8. Check down list of other self-care distractions, freshen up and feel good about myself.  \n9. Get something accomplished by doing some chores and tidying up.  \n10. Do something enjoyable, listen to music and float away on the lyrics.  \n\n##Distract your Thoughts  \n\n* Imagine something amazing happening, like you stumble upon a portal to another world. Will you go through, and what will you bring with you?¬†¬†\n\n* Think about someone you love / care about, and decide on something kind you can say or do for them. Give them a hug or text them (or imagine how lovely it will feel to hug them again).  \n\n* Think about sex, with a partner or even just a crush or a celebrity you find attractive.¬†¬†\n\n* Think of something you can do on your next day off, something fun like a new project or restaurant you‚Äôve been curious to try.¬†¬†\n\n* Remind yourself that whatever you‚Äôre worried about will come to pass (as all things to), and think about how relieved you‚Äôll feel then, not how worried you are now.¬†¬†\n\n* Imagine you‚Äôre disguised as someone on a secret operative - stay focused on not blowing your cover!¬†¬†\n\n* Focus on the natural world around you, plants or animals, or the sky, even if it‚Äôs just looking out the window.¬†¬†¬†\n\n* Imagine yourself as a superhero (or antihero), would you have an outfit, and what advantages or powers would you have?¬†¬†\n\n* Think about a specific animal and how they experience the world - a deer gracefully walking through a forest, or a curious octopus exploring the ocean floor.¬† \n\n* Imagine yourself having a positive interaction with someone whose opinion matters to you. What do they say, are they praising you and if so why?¬†¬†\n\n* Take deep breaths and do breathing exercises. Close your eyes. Meditate if you know how, or learn how to.¬†¬†\n\n* Remember past events that were fun and exciting, and try to recall as many details about those moments as you can.¬†¬†\n\n* Listen to music or a podcast, or think about one you like or listened to recently.¬†¬†\n\n* See if you can recall all lyrics to your favourite songs and sing them in your head.¬† \n\n* Dance, practice some moves or even just be silly about it.¬†¬† \n\n##Distract yourself with Chores  \n\n* Throw out any trash that‚Äôs cluttering surfaces, empty garbage/recycle, clean the bins if they‚Äôre dirty.¬†¬†\n\n* Clean dishes and dry/put them away.  \n\n* Dust all surfaces with a microfibre cloth, and wipe them clean if stained.¬†¬†\n\n* Do laundry (including bedding and throw blankets).¬†¬†\n\n* Clothing and accessories all put away properly (coat in closet not on the back of a chair).¬†¬†\n\n* Sweep the floors and vacuum, washed if necessary.¬†¬†\n\n* Clean the bathroom (change shower curtain liner).¬†¬†\n\n* Wash windows and windowsills.¬†¬†\n\n* Open windows to let fresh air in, and/or spray the window curtains and furniture with freshener.¬†¬†\n\n##Distract yourself with Self-Care  \n**Grooming**\n\n* Shower, shave, lotion face for hydration and lotion up body with a nice scent.¬†¬†\n\n* Trim and buff nails, get properly dressed.¬†¬†\n\n* Book a haircut and eyebrow wax if you‚Äôre overdue for one.¬†¬†\n\n* Buy some new clothing items, including new socks and underclothes.¬†¬†\n\n* Replenish any hygiene items *before* they run out.¬†¬†\n\n**Body**\n\n* Exercise - if you don‚Äôt have a routine then draft one that includes cardio, strength and core exercises.¬†¬†\n\n* Go for a walk (weather permitting).¬†¬†\n\n* Stay hydrated, keep a bottle of water nearby and limit other beverages to tea/coffee.¬†¬†¬†¬†\n\n* Get attention from a partner (or) rub one out yourself.¬†¬†\n\n* Meal plan for the day or week, make a list to pick up anything you‚Äôll need to buy and set out any freezer items for defrosting the day before.¬†¬†¬†¬†\n\n* Dance - it will get your heart rate up and make you feel better.¬†¬†\n\n* Did you take a multivitamin today?¬†¬†\n\n##Distract yourself with Pleasurable Activities\n* Listen to music (read lyrics)  \n* Listen to an audio, save memorable quotes, write a review  \n* Listen to a podcast¬†  \n* Listen to ASMR¬†  \n* Read the news  \n* Read a book or article  \n* Watch Youtube Videos (funny, educational, tutorials)  \n* Watch a movie or series, then write a review  \n* Write a short story  \n* Write a song  \n* Write a poem  \n* Write a letter to someone (don‚Äôt need to send)  \n* Draw something (fan art, doodles, recreate an artwork)  \n* Scrapbook (choose lyrics and cut the letters out of a paper)  \n* Take a bath or shower  \n* Look up a new recipe, go get the ingredients, then make it.

He said he didn‚Äôt have the kind of time that I needed bc he was too busy, and things in his life were overwhelming him. While he had every right to do that, I was sad and hurt.

Poor ER and IE on my part. \n\nCome Sunday... regret. I bombard him with anxious texts throughout the day, begging him to call me so that I can apologize and we can work something out. No response.\n\nMonday he sends me a text saying that he was overwhelmed and needed space and that he was genuinely sorry for not handling things well. We talked a little more after that - I think I was pretty effective, smoothing things over while also maintaining my self-respect - and at least we‚Äôre on better terms. But he still needs space. He (although never explicitly) guaranteed he‚Äôd reach out later, but idk. Part of me doesn‚Äôt believe he will.\n\n// SKILLS\n\nI need help practicing radical acceptance. I‚Äôve always had trouble with it. But I need to accept that this guy needs/wants space and that I have to respect that. I also need to accept that there‚Äôs a possibility I may never see him again.\n\nAs far as not reaching out to him and violating that boundary, impulse control skill suggestions would be helpful. I‚Äôd also like to be less sad about this obviously, so if anyone has skill suggestions for that, it would be great.\n\nThankfully I‚Äôm seeing my therapist tomorrow.",

I‚Äôm a bit biased towards cognitive behavioral therapy approaches so this may be less relevant if that isn‚Äôt your preference. I also find the Calm app helpful but didn‚Äôt include it in the list since you need to pay to access the main benefit.\n\nWithout further ado:\n\n[Mood Self Assessment](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/stress-anxiety-depression/mood-self-assessment/)\\- This questionnaire is really good at gauging roughly where you‚Äôre at and then pointing you to helpful resources based on your answers.\n\n[Catch it](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/csd/app-directory/catch-it/) \\- A simple free mood tracker and diary app based on cognitive behavioral therapy principles. It doesn‚Äôt try to overcomplicate anything. Especially helpful for recording anxious thoughts.\n\n[Cove](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/cove-music-for-mental-health/id1020256581) \\- Helps you express emotions through music. It‚Äôs like a music mood diary. Sounds quite unusual but is helpful to people who struggle to express themselves. Still needs work but cool idea.\n\n[Iona](http://get-iona.web.app/) \\- App that walks you through cognitive behavioural therapy and mindfulness exercises. Much more engaging than reading articles or worksheets and easy to use.\n\n[Mind](https://www.mind.org.uk/) \\- A great aggregator and portal of mental health resources. One of the most helpful features is it lets you select what you need help with and it directs you to useful resources.\n\n[What‚Äôs Up](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/whats-up-a-mental-health-app/id968251160) \\- This is a good one stop shop if you‚Äôre looking for something to give you immediate relief.

I wanted to share something that really helps me. For about two years now, when I get really deep in the weeds, I start up with a journaling routine. Every night, I fill out a sheet that looks something like this. I make the template with black ink the night before (or several nights before, if I feel like doing a bunch at a time), and each night, I take my colored pens, and fill this form out. The routine is pleasant and grounding, and it helps anchor me to the tools and skills I'm practicing everyday.\n\nI generally stick with a format/template for a few months, and then when I emerge out of my depression, I find I need it less and less. I eventually drop it, because I don't need it anymore. Then I get depressed again. Then I start up with a new format (I've cycled through about 10 so far) and work my way out of depression again. This time around, I think I'm going to do my best to stick with this, even when I'm feeling well. Maybe that will make it harder for me to fall into depression. Maybe it'll make me feel more resilient.  I took a DBT outpatient program years ago, and I really liked the worksheets, but found that I wish they were a little customizable.\n\nAlso, just so you know, you can make whatever you want. You can do this in addition to your worksheets. You can do something close to this. You can make a sheet based off these principles that look completely different.\n\nIf you have any suggestions about how to make this more tied to DBT principles, let me know! If there's anyway to improve these, let me know! I'm so into experimentation and exploration. Let's experiment together!\n\n***FULL DISCLAIMER: This isn't official. I'm not a clinician. Don't replace your official prescribed worksheets with this!!!***\n\n**The basics:**\n\n* graphing paper helps, but isn't necessary.\n* a ruler to help make the boxes/sections\n* I LOVE colored pens, but it's up to you. (I use G2 Pilots, fyi)\n* you don't have to be good at art, or have good handwriting (look at mine, it's terrible), you just have to try! It really doesn't need to look perfect, or like it was ripped from pintrest or IG, it just needs to be functional for you.\n* I know doing this everyday seems a bit of a drag, but I find the practice of making these boxes really soothing and meditative. It's a practice. It's like I'm investing in myself, the more work I do.\n* I take sometimes up to an hour each night to do this. I know that's a lot of time, but honestly, it's an investment in my health. So I don't care.\n\n**1.** **M\\*\\*\\*\\*ood chart**\n\n* I start by charting my mood for the day with a little line graph, it really helps me understand the day better. I don't know why. It just does!\n\n**2. Lows/Highs**\n\n* The points where your mood was highest and the points where it was lowest.\n\n**3. Tools used**\n\n* This is the section of the chart that's the most DBT-y, in my opinion. If you used a DBT skill today, write it down. Over time you'll see how much you actually are doing, and it'll make you feel good.\n\n**4. The five boxes.**\n\n* you can really put anything in here. I put STRUCTURE, SWEAT, NOURISH, RELAX, SELF-LOVE, because those are keywords that mean something to me. I've noticed that when my day is structured, I do better. So in that box, I write down how I broke up my day, how I left the house, how I took a break for lunch.... whatever.\n* likewise, I really do well when I sweat at least once a day. Sweating could be intellectual or physical. So I might write: had a really good study session today. Or \"went to the gym\". Get the picture?\n* You can put whatever you want. Maybe some DBT tools that you wanted to practice, maybe list the emotions you experienced, maybe some goals you want to hit everyday. Get creative!!\n\n**5. Achievements**\n\n* For me, this is the most important box. It's simple. I just list my accomplishments of the day. I need to do this because my brain will erase my accomplishments if I don't write them down, stare at them, make sure to cherish them. And if it was a bad day, a void day, I find something to celebrate, dammit.\n* I flip the page and continue on the back if I run out of room in this box. It's so important to me to list every damn thing I did that I was proud of (or should be proud of) I don't spare any time.\n\nThat's it!\n\nEDIT: I uploaded a version of the img with my username on it, as was recommended to me!",

    "selftext": "It's a 2 part question really:\n\n1. I am using marsha's workbook and I am in the 7th week so far. Radical acceptance is really tricky for me and I absolutely dreaded the first week of doing the skill. It was hard because I wanted to avoid the situations, facts etc that I wasn't fully accepting since they were hurtfull. Also one of them was that \"I am not a bad person\" since I feel like it a lot lately but I am not sure it's right to try to accept that. Faking acceptance seems to work well with me and in the long run makes me feel more at peace and have less ruminations about the situation I am trying to accept. It's difficult for me thought to understand what exactly I need to do to practice each step. I don't understand what coping ahead really means for example or how to attend to my body sensations so I half ass it and basically only do a couple steps. How can i get the most out of radical acceptance?\n2. Since I am doing dbt all by myself and simply discuss it briefly with my psychotherapist/psychiatrist I am sure I am not getting the most out of dbt since I don't have to be accountable to anyone else or be monitored. I try to spend at least 20 mins each day to practice and do my weekly worksheets. I usually choose 2-4 worksheets for the week and add in a little by little every day (some days if I am having a hard time I practice skills for up to 2-3 hours so it depends). I've also began a journal to monitor myself because I tend to forget most of my week. Other than that should I spend more time and try to practice every waking moment? Does meditating for at least 5 mins a day do anything?",

    "selftext": "So I learned DBT a few years ago, really implemented it into my life big time and had the hugest turn around possible. Basically saved my life. \nNow it‚Äôs been a few years, and I don‚Äôt have to think about it or use it every day but I‚Äôm still so grateful that it‚Äôs something I have in my toolbox. I wanna tell u guys a story of how I had to use it again a few weeks ago and I‚Äôm going to try to keep some details a little vague. Here we go! \n\nSo earlier this month I went a couple hours up north to learn something with a group of basically strangers, and we were camping. \n\nWhile I was up there luckily one of the guys noticed my one tire was totally bald on the inside, like through the wires and everything. He told me I‚Äôd have to get a spare put on cos I wouldn‚Äôt make it home with that one, and that all the others looked the same and would need to be replaced, plus an alignment needed to be done probably, and that there‚Äôd be an underlying issue causing that as well. Basically he told me this is gonna be expensive af and a huge ordeal for me. \n\nLuckily another guy there is also a mechanic! These two awesome dudes got to work putting my spare on for me, and I started to feel really overwhelmed thinking about what I just found out. I felt myself quickly losing control in front of them both and so embarrassed cos I thought I was about to actually burst out crying. \n\nAnd then DBT came to me in my mind like a spotlight honestly. And I told myself yes I‚Äôm feeling very upset about this and that‚Äôs valid. I need to acknowledge the feeling and acknowledge that I‚Äôm justified to feel that way, then let myself feel it, and then let it pass. AND I DID! \n\nI shed a couple calm tears inside my sunglasses and then moved on and it wasn‚Äôt embarrassing at all. Finished up the rest of that day with everyone else and didn‚Äôt feel anything horrible building up inside me like how I would have handled it before I learned DBT. \n\nI felt really proud of myself cos that was like my total nightmare scenario, I‚Äôm stuck here with a bunch of people I barely know, I have no ‚Äúsafe‚Äù people to confide in, I have no private area of my own to retreat to. There was no way for me to get out of there and have a breakdown! \n\nBefore DBT I would have bottled it all up and felt like a hot pile of volatile shit until I got home the next day, but instead I rode the wave and not only survived the bad feelings but made some good ones too by making myself proud and building mastery. Anyways I‚Äôm not much of a storyteller but learn DBT if you can guys it‚Äôs truly incredible.\n\nEdited to add- it looks like I used a stop skill in there too! Didn‚Äôt even realize it til now.",

    "title": "Skills for Feeling of Impending Doom",
    "selftext": "Hey, gang! Looking for a little direction here.\n\nOccasionally, I experience a feeling of impending doom. The sensation is akin to hopelessness (but it's not depression), and evokes worry and an obsessive desire to solve or escape the problem/feeling (but it's not anxiety or panic). Usually it is attached to a particular trigger, like health anxiety, but sometimes it occurs out of the blue with no antecedent. It is definitely worse in the winter when it's very dark where I live, but I haven't had much luck managing it with a SAD lamp.\n\nI've gone through the algorithm to figure out how to address it. Problem solving isn't particularly effective, because I don't know what causes this feeling, and attempting to problem solve can put me in a bit of an obsessive loop. It's quite uncomfortable, and I don't know that I can change how I feel about that. That leaves me with accepting the feeling, and I'd love to hear some input about how I can be accepting of this feeling in a way that's more effective.\n\nIn my head, I frame the feeling as (1) not a threat and (2) temporary. Then, I try to move on from it and distract myself from the feeling. This was effective tonight, as I got distracted by the task of turning in my kids' online homework, and realized that the feeling had lifted after I had completed that task. I think one of the reasons that distraction worked here was that I wasn't *trying* to distract myself. Somehow the act of *trying* to distract myself is never all that effective, whereas genuine busyness is highly effective.\n\nAny other advice wrt how to accept an uncomfortable but not immediately dangerous emotion like this? Any good skills that I'm not thinking of that might be as effective as distraction? How might I implement opposite action in this circumstance?",

I am looking for some clarification on when to use this skill and when to avoid using it, since I know using the wrong skill for a situation could make it worse. We are supposed to come up with a list of 2 very important things and 2 not very important things in our lives that we need to radically accept (and then go through check the facts, etc.) I have a few ideas, but I would love if someone could give their opinion on whether these are appropriate for radical acceptance or not.\n\n1. My boyfriend is fairly abusive toward me. However, I love him and don‚Äôt wish to leave the relationship at this time. I want to give him a chance to go to therapy and try to fix things, so can I radically accept that he is sometimes abusive? Or is that not a good idea since I shouldn‚Äôt tolerate abuse and I know that I ‚Äúshould‚Äù leave him. (Not interested in comments on what I should do in regard to leaving or staying with him in this situation, thanks. I know of domestic violence resources to help me and I am working through it.) I understand that radical acceptance doesn‚Äôt mean you approve of what is happening, but I wasn‚Äôt sure how that applied to an abusive situation.\n2. Can I radically accept that my body is bigger than I would like it to be or that I am not as pretty as I would like to be? Do I need to reword that to be less judgmental? I would love some assistance on what specifically I should radically accept. Do I accept that I personally consider myself to be fat, or that I am a certain shirt and pant size, or that I am bigger than other people? I am very interested in using this for my homework but I‚Äôm not sure what exactly I am supposed to radically accept. Also, I am confused as to if radical acceptance has to be about a specific situation in my life or something that happened or if it could be something that I internally feel about myself.\n3. Could I radically accept that I am more emotional than the average person and that I cry more easily in sad situations? Or is it bad to radically accept something where I compare myself to others like that?\n\nMaybe I‚Äôm just overthinking all of this, but I really want to make sure I‚Äôm not doing the worksheet wrong.

Opposite action, smile and be nice to them.\n\nI have an issue with this. A deep one. To take an example, if I have an extreme reaction to someone close to me saying something hurtful that on a scale of 1-10 is a 3 and i'm reacting like its a 10 i can, and do, take different action like of instead of shouting about it i'll withdraw till i calm down and can talk about it. Pretending it doesn't upset me (so doing the total opposite) feels awful. Its giving a positive reaction to something i don't like (so reinforcing behaviour i don't want), its being fake about how i'm feeling, it feels like self abandonment and upsets me even more.\n\nMy emotions are valid, while yes the way i'm feeling might be disproportional to what is happening in the moment it is understandable. I can often when unpacking it later pinpoint something like it reminded me of spicy memories or was the 100th example of hurtful behaviour that i'd been trying to ignore / in denial of and hit my limit.\n\nHow do all of you use opposite action interpersonally?

I'm scared to look at myself in the mirror, and seeing pictures of myself makes me cry. It's getting kind of dangerously bad and is really messing with my life. Like for example, I drove my mom home from surgery today and started to cry during it. I can't study or do just about anything I need to because I feel so awful. I don't know what to do :(\n\nI'm in a bit of therapy limbo right now too. I stopped therapy for a bit because I was doing really well and my therapist said to call her if I needed anything. So I called her but it turns out she's changed workplaces and can't accept new patients right now. I'm looking for a new therapist, but I have no idea when I'll find someone good and how soon they can see me. In the meantime, I need some help. Any advice/suggestions are welcome, thank you!",

    "selftext": "‚ÄúCore Concept: Mindfulness of our emotions can soothe them.\n\nWhen we try to get rid of, fight, or judge our emotions, we risk adding suffering to emotional pin. Like any rejection, these approaches create a negative counter-response. Our emotions are part of us with information to share, and refusal to accept them increases their intensity.\n\nWillingness to be with your emotions soothes them. It is like truly listening to a friend‚Äôs concern or sitting with another person‚Äôs distress without having to fix it. Not trying to fix your emotions and instead simply being present with them is a solution. Even strong emotions often do not require immediate action.\n\nYou can be present and ‚Äúhold‚Äù your emotions through mindfulness. Holding emotions means that you recognize them as part of your experience while also recognizing that they are not you. When we simply be with our emotions, we open ourselves to their ebbs and flows non-judgmentally and usually find that the intensity subsides.\n\nObserve your emotions without getting stuck, and practice Radical Acceptance when they are painful. If you do find your emotions to be overwhelming in the moment, change your strategies and use distress tolerance skills. You can go back to mindfulness of your emotions when their intensity subsides a little. \n\nYou will find that emotions have important information for you, and they soothe themselves when we listen to them. Be open and relating to and learning from what your emotions have to say.‚Äù\n\n-The Expanded DBT Skills Training Manual by Lane Pederson page 120",

    "selftext": "I'm currently on a waiting list for DBT. Recently I did a 6 day intensive programme, that was very DBT focused. It taught us many DBT skills, just briefly, and the one thing I kept coming back round to was the realisation that I really struggle with self compassion and self worth. It's felt by everyone in my care team, myself included, that if I can get past this and learn to be more self compassionate, then the other skills will fall into place. I find it really hard to use a lot of the skills at the moment because I just don't feel worthy of allowing myself to feel better or be helped.\n\nAll that being said, I'm really worried that this will hold me back if and when I do get to do DBT. I've already done a year of a different therapy and I got to a point where I realised I just couldn't do the work necessary for the therapy to help me. I'm really worried this will happen again with DBT.\n\nCan anyone give any advice on any skills or anything I can do to try and work on/improve my self compassion whilst I'm waiting to start? Also any advice around 'doing the work'? I loosely get what is meant by it, but also really struggle to identify what the work is, in order to do it",

    "selftext": "Hi, I'm new to this community, and this is my first post.\n\nI've read and was told in an IOP that Distress Tolerance skills are only for a crisis. Why is it bad to use them if I'm not in a crisis? I understand not relying on them all the time and can understand how some skills may be valuable to use less frequently. \n\nI've been having trouble with dissociation lately and having trouble going to bed at a decent hour. I'm not sure what is triggering this, but it is causing real problems in my ability to function. Things like eating, cleaning, and going outside are hard right now. I'm not super emotional; I'm numb. I have no idea what the trigger was, but this has been going on off and on for weeks. Is numbness considered an crisis the same way extreme emotion is (if I'm not in danger of self-harming behaviors)? How do you know when it's appropriate to use them?\n\nI think it's probably appropriate to use them considering how much trouble I've had lately. Avoidance/numbing behaviors have been playing for hours on my phone, deep internet dives, and Netflix binges. I'm unemployed and desperately need to apply for work, and I can't afford to lose weight. Writing it out, it's kind of obvious I need it now, but it isn't always so obvious. If it's a one-off situation, is it still good to use them, or is that relying on them too much.\n\nThank you for your help!",

I'm losing sleep from this and the only way I actually manage to sleep is to stay on my phone as a distraction from my thoughts until I pass out into a probably very low quality sleep due to having been staring at a screen. I try not to use distraction too much in the day and actually deal with my feelings instead, but that's too effortful to do when I want to go to sleep. I feel like no matter how hard I try all I'm actually doing is postponing the emotional breakdown. And when I say breakdown I don't just mean feeling bad I mean having maladaptive thought patterns and urges and not being very able to manage it, whereas when I'm using skills it isn't a 'breakdown' if I'm sad because I am able to feel it in a healthy way. Sorry if this makes no sense, this was a really hard thing to explain. It just gets very exhausting when I'm trying so hard to use skills all the time and it just comes back again over and over anyway.

Seemed like this subreddit would be the best place to do that. \n\nWe are going to use \"The Dialectical Behavior Skills Workbook\" by McKay, Wood, and Brantley. \n\nI am hoping this will be a collective effort with different people taking responsibility for different weeks. But, I am going to kick things off and suggest some structure. These are just my ideas. I am going to create another post where we can discuss together what we think is the best way to proceed. We may want to use another application, like Discord to discuss stuff as well. \n\nFirst, please read the posting rules on the sidebar. Along with the posting rules on r/BPD, these will be our guiding rules for posting. Second, you don‚Äôt have to share any worksheets that you don‚Äôt want to. It is probably a good idea to do them (but still, you may decide that some are too trigger-y right now‚Äîyou can come back to them later). Think about what your boundaries are and engage in good self-care around these exercises. \n\nAs for a schedule, I was thinking we can do a chapter every 2-3 weeks. We can both post the answers to the worksheets and discuss the information in the chapter. These might be best separated into different posts: one to share and discuss worksheets and one to just have a general discussion about the concepts and how they can apply to our lives.\n\nHere is a possible schedule for the first 2 weeks:\n\nWeek 1: \nRead Introduction \nShare answers to question on p 2. \nRead Chapter 1: pages 5-12\nOn your own, do checklist on p. 5-6 and worksheet on p. 6-7. (I am concerned these materials may violate r/dbt posting rules about discussions of self-harm, so that is why I think it might be best to not share these here.) \nShare a list of your preferred radical acceptance statements (p. 11) and the situations where you are willing to practice radical acceptance (p. 12).\n\nWeek 2: \nRead Chapter 1: pages 6-17\nShare a list non-harming distress distracting behaviors you are willing to practice (p. 13).\nShare a list of pleasurable activities you are willing to use to distract yourself (p. 16-17).\n\nSo, here is my first share.\n\nThree things do I do when upset or overwhelmed that are damaging‚Äîand that I am committed to replace with better ways to cope.\n\n1. Thinking a lot about (and sometimes telling) my SO how it is their behavior that is causing all my problems.\n2.  Go to extremes‚Äîeither I try to do something perfectly or completely collapse in a ball of fear, despair, and self-hatred. \n3. Either obsess about helping and pleasing people or cut myself off from them, assuming that they are mad at me about something.\n",

    "selftext": "Here's some tips based on my experience that I just made. Figured I'd post it here so others can benefit too. Not official DBT but I learned this in my DBT group. \n\n5 skills (general advice)\n\nWhen you're having trouble it's good to use a skill, any skill, but ideally you'll want to use five types of skills when you have a crisis for maximum impact. It's what my friends and I do. It doesn't have to be this exact sequence/types of skills, you won't always need the whole thing, but it's one sequence that works for people. And if you're still feeling weird after using skills you can check if you missed a category. \n\n(5 second delay/STOP skill so you can use skills) --> distract yourself  --> physical grounding/mindfulness  --> physically process emotion  --> process thoughts, judgments, and identify ‚Äúthreat‚Äù/check the facts  --> problem solve situation\n\nDistraction skills for when urges are really high: doing a word association game where you start with \"apple\" and say the next word that comes into your head (redirecting when you get into unsafe subjects into another word), bouncing a ball around, the motions of making tea, a quick mobile game. Distraction helps you get yourself to the point of being able to think without catastrophizing immediately. \n\nThen a grounding skill like mindfulness, 5-4-3-2-1, telling yourself you're safe, TIPP or using ice just so that you're in the present moment. \n\nThen physical processing of the emotion, since emotions are both physical and cognitive, like through TIPP or PMR or yoga/breathing exercises, tapping on your chest. \n\nThen cognitive processing of the event so you don't keep thinking about it all night- Check the Facts is the best skill to use here, but journaling works too. Nonjudgmentally try to describe what got you upset in the first place. Write it down if possible. Remove as many assumptions or judgments from the situation as you can. Rewrite your statement. Then identify where the threat is coming from, what you are afraid of deep down. How realistic is the threat? Visualize how would you handle the threat if it happened. \n\nThen lastly, problem solving of the event. Do you need to apologize to someone/need an apology from someone? Need to do a DEARMAN? Need to remind yourself you're valid even if other people are struggling and say otherwise? Make a plan for the next time the problem happens? This helps reduce your work in the future and can bring closure. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's a quick example aimed at a younger audience that I wrote it for using skills in sequence, sorry it might not apply as well here: \n\nYou are upset that someone took a fidget of yours. You pause using 5 second delay, walk away and use a distraction skill- listening to music. You ground yourself by counting the ceiling tiles. You take some deep breaths as you do this to help with the physical emotions. You ask yourself why you're upset, and find it's because people keep taking your stuff and it doesn't seem fair, so the threat is things not feeling fair. You imagine yourself handling an unfair situation like all the other unfair situations in your life- surviving it, trying to do the right thing yourself, accepting that sometimes people won't change unless you give them time. You re-describe the situation nonjudgmentally as: you stood up and went to get water. A person sat down in the lounge you were in. They started using your rubix cube. You asked them to stop and they said there were rubix cubes for everyone, not realizing it was yours. You left because you got angry. You problem solve by deciding to point out the next time the person does the same thing that they've already done it before and that they're not being fair and probably do realize it's yours. You decide to do this within earshot of adults so that they know it's a repeated problem. You tell yourself it's just some stuff so you're not going to do anything else, but you are going to at least give the feedback that taking people's fidgets when they're gone for a few minutes is annoying and then move on with your life.",

I have a great day and then I feel deeply depressed afterward (ie, the day after an interview, or getting a job offer). I often self sabotage and feel like I can't stop (I rationalize by saying just 5 more minutes, then distract myself and say tomorrow, and then get scared and freeze- 2 weeks passed this way). I have high anxiety in making phone calls and checking (or replying to emails)- I fear what I will find. I have ADHD and have such a scattershot approach if one thing isn't working. \n\n When going outside of my home, even on great days where it looks like I am calm, cool, and confident, normal appointments, tasks, activities are still emotionally draining to me. My anxiety just runs high all the time- when doing and when avoiding. When things are done I worry about the things I haven't done or the future. I am on anti anxiety medication. I wish I could totally emotionally detach from myself and just do what needs to be done like a robot.",

    "selftext": "I‚Äôm reading The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook. So far it‚Äôs been helpful, and I‚Äôve been taking pretty detailed notes, otherwise I‚Äôd forget everything. I‚Äôm finishing up chapter two, and there‚Äôs a section on radical acceptance. It has its description of what radical acceptance is, and I thought it sounded great. Then it gives a fictional example of a situation in which radical acceptance could have helped, as well as a list of questions that are then answered as they apply to this fictional situation. Then the questions are listed so that you can answer them yourself in regards to your own situation, like so: \n- What events led up to the situation?\n- What role did you play in creating the situation?\n- What did you have control of in the situation?\n- etc\n\nI recognized these questions as questions I was made to answer in a worksheet a few years back. I was in treatment at a psychiatric hospital. A situation happened (I wont go into details because it‚Äôs easily identifiable) that quickly got out of control. My treatment team made a decision about something I would not be forced to do due to a disability of mine, but the techs refused to believe me or find the documentation for this decision or this disability, and instead tried to force me to do the thing. This ended up escalating after I had done everything in my power to resolve the situation in a calm manner. I threw something without intending to. I got in a lot of trouble and was made to fill out a worksheet with these questions on them about the situation. \n\nThe problem with being made to answer these radical acceptance questions in light of the situation, is that I was made to take all responsibility, and no one else took any. Not my treatment team, not the techs. Despite the situation not being my fault (A few days after the incident, upon talking to my treatment team, they agreed that the situation was in no way my fault, and that it should never have happened. Yet there were no repercussions for anyone except me.), I was told to ‚Äòexamine my role in creating the situation‚Äô, and write what I could have done different next time. \n\nSo when I came across these questions in the DBT skills workbook, I was immediately turned off of the concept of radical acceptance, and honestly, the whole book. I don‚Äôt want to push away all things DBT because of this, but that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm tempted to do. \n\nI guess I‚Äôm making this post to see if anyone has any advice on overcoming my aversion to radical acceptance, so that I can continue with DBT. Or any advice in general. Thank you for taking the time to read.",

    "selftext": "I stopped practicing DBT for a while because I thought I was \"so much better\" even though I knew it's best to keep practicing. So my DBT skills are very rusty now. I feel like I need some distress tolerance skills maybe. My plan is to get my DBT book open and start one skill. Thought it might help to ask for suggestions here-  really appreciate this group! \n\nThere's a bit more below but the summary is this: in July started a job and had to work with a really aggressive coworker/trainer for 4 months and it took a big emotional toll on me.\n\nWe are in a small department so only 2 works a shift usually and you stay with that person for a while. She was respectful and helpful at first, saying I was doing great, but eventually after week 3 she would often say \"We'll go over this later\". Also she'd become angry easily, either slamming the keyboard or mouse with her hands, or communicating in a really aggressive tone of voice. She expected me to do things I wasn't trained on. When I asked to learn something, that did not go well. This all continued for 4 months. Also, our job involves emergency situations, and because of this I can't try to figure things out by myself like other jobs. One small mistake could be very serious.\n\nThe hardest part is how much of a toll it took on me emotionally and it still does. This brought up trauma from my past (lot of anger and abuse). Since I was new, I was nervous to bring the issue to management. Others in the office are mostly respectful but can quickly turn catty, rude and very petty. It's usually not too bad with other people, but it's still hard.\n\nGood news though- I was switched with another senior coworker because there's a new person who will be trained by the lady who trained me. This new partner/coworker is really great to work with. My manager offered to go through things with me and I'm lucky she is great and really professional, so I'm confident this will get sorted out soon. But here I am, on my day off, and cannot get the anxiety from all this out of my mind.",

Through my work I look to understand male suicide risk and recovery factors better. As some of you may know too well, male suicide is the biggest killer of men under 50 in Britain, and according to the Samaritan‚Äôs three-quarters of all suicides in 2018 were male. Having seen people I love experience these feelings, I wanted to build a greater understanding of what causes suicidal feelings and behaviours in men and what more can be done to help.\n\nI have developed a survey to explore some of these issues. The survey takes 30 minutes to complete and covers topics including childhood experiences, self-esteem, connection with others and mental pain as well as suicidal feelings. Even if you have never had suicidal thoughts or feelings before, your answers would still give me valuable insights. The survey is open to all men 18 and over, located any where. The more men I can get to complete the survey, the stronger my analysis can be, so please do share this post and details with friends, family, colleagues, community groups, or drop me a message if you know a way I could help get it out to more people. Your support would be greatly appreciated.\n\nHere is the survey link: [https://glasgow-research.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/males](https://glasgow-research.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/males)\n\nPlease do let me know if you have any questions and please do complete the survey if you feel moved to or share this post if appropriate.\n\nMany thanks, everyone,\n\nSusie",

    "title": "Preparing for OCD Exposure therapy using DBT",
    "selftext": "I have been practicing DBT skills to try to make exposure treatment more tolerable. What I am having most trouble with is staying with the feelings and I totally fall apart and give up when forced to completely resist all mental and physical compulsions. The worst symptoms over the past 2 years have been related to apologizing incessantly to my wife for shameful thoughts, social avoidance specifically related to thinking I‚Äôm going to infect someone with COVID, and perfectionism in writing which has forced me to take leave from school this summer. \n\nI am able to do sitting meditation for 20 minutes a day, and have been doing so most of the last 3 years. My core mindfulness skills are lacking. My own explanations of the thoughts and feelings I‚Äôm having don‚Äôt track with my therapist and she doesn‚Äôt seem willing to look at the situation other than as rigid cause and effect. She acknowledges there are risk factors outside myself, but so far DBT seems really dismissive. I think it‚Äôs just that from my POV everything is boiling down to ‚Äúshut up and do it like this,‚Äù and when it doesn‚Äôt change how I feel I have to just repeat again until it works. \n\nPerhaps I‚Äôm missing something about wise mind. I know that I conflate my thoughts and feelings all the time. I know that wise mind accepts, but as best I can tell,accepting intrusive thoughts or feelings or whatever these are just leads to the answer ‚Äúnothing can be done.‚Äù\n\nHas anyone learned to accept ocd using DBT, and what is the mechanism that acts to let this happen?",

While we are looking to improve how psychologists and clinicians measure your eating disorder recovery process, you do not need to be currently in or considering recovery to participate. Anybody is welcome.\n\nIf you decide to take part or wish to see more information about the study (e.g. how we will keep your responses safe and what the questions will involve), please click the following link: [https://chesterpsychology.fra1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_1KVOaiQaiBIB1mB](https://chesterpsychology.fra1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_1KVOaiQaiBIB1mB)\n\nThe study should take approximately 20 minutes to complete but you can take as long as you need. Some of the questions will ask about current mood, any suicidal thoughts or self-harm, and your eating disorder symptoms and recovery experience so far. If there is a chance that this could be triggering, there is no obligation to take part and there is always the option to stop the questionnaire at any time. Any answers you give within the questionnaire are completely confidential and anonymous.\n\nThank you,\n\nRebecca.",

It's time to start performing some opposite actions for love, but I feel very limited in these options since I'm still co-parenting with her. Following the general opposite actions listed in Emotion Regulation Handout 13 of Marsha's handbook:\n\n1. **Avoid the person altogether.** I can't avoid her altogether. We're raising children.\n2. **Distract yourself from thoughts of the beloved.** I try my best to distract from her, but this is understandably not always in my power.\n3. **Avoid contact with all reminders of the beloved.** I'm absolutely not cutting my kids out of my life, and they are the greatest reminder of my beloved.\n4. **Remind yourself of why love is not justified.** This is the most \"possible\" step. I have a growing list of reasons why love is no longer justified or effective. And it's extremely painful to go over, but I can.\n\nI don't want to go to war with her, both for the kids' sakes and my own sanity. Any advice on letting go in my difficult situation?",

His person, however, will spout this practice as using our emotions to regulate someone else.  He uses the phrases from DBT, but makes his own definitions of what they mean.  \n\nHe has thousands of followers, one of them being a very good friend of mine who buys into everything he says, and is easily convincing because of his videos.\n\nI guess I just want to remind those who seek the DBT program that while it is not available everywhere, please do not accept the guidance of those who pretend to be knowledgeable in DBT.",

I have decided to do an on-paper diary card because I am doing the Linehan worksheets on paper too, and already love my  bullet journal/writing with a pen. I don't need to do a specific diary card per my program, because my individual therapist isn't specifically focused on DBT (she was basically like \"do a card every day, and if you want to talk about any of it, we can\" lol). \n\nDo you have a pdf of a diary card that you love that is specific to beginners? I think it would be really useful to have one with the names of the skills listed, not just their general categories (Interpersonal Relationships, etc). I'm not in recovery/abstinance, so I don't need a card focused on that- which is why I am not buying the DBT planner ([https://www.unhookedmedia.com/stock/the-dialectical-behavior-therapy-wellness-planner](https://www.unhookedmedia.com/stock/the-dialectical-behavior-therapy-wellness-planner)) though it looks amazing.\n\nAlso wanted to say that this sub has been quite a strong resource for me as I learned about the method, looked for a group, and kept myself semi sane through 2020.

I am a researcher in the School of Psychology, University College Dublin, Ireland, working in a team of researchers looking at the experience of having a diagnosis changed, removed, or supplemented with a new one. We're looking to interview anyone over 18 who has had an experience like this (details below). Mods have given me permission to post this recruitment ad.\n\n**Have you engaged with mental health services?**  \n**Have you ever had a psychiatric diagnosis removed, replaced, or supplemented with a different diagnosis?**\n\n**Consider participating in our research project!**\n\nWe are a team of researchers from University College Dublin conducting a project called Lived Experience of Diagnostic Shifts in Adult Mental Health. This study has received ethical approval from the UCD Research Ethics Committee.\n\nFor people experiencing mental health difficulties, it is fairly common that their diagnosis will change over the course of their engagement with mental health services. Diagnoses can be changed for many different reasons. Despite the frequency with which this happens, no research has explored how people experience these ‚Äòdiagnostic shifts‚Äô. Our study aims to identify how diagnostic shifts affect people‚Äôs lives and any challenges they may present. We want to use this information to improve support to mental health service-users during this time of transition.\n\nFor our study, we would like to interview people who have experienced a diagnostic shift. We would like people to tell us, in their own words, how they understood the reasons for the change in their diagnosis, and any positive or negative implications it had for their lives. Interviews will take place over videochat software (eg. Zoom) and all participation will be completely confidential.\n\nBy contributing to this study, you will help improve our understanding of people‚Äôs experience of diagnostic shifts and raise awareness of the challenges diagnostic changes can present. We hope to use the research to improve clinical communication of diagnostic changes and make it easier for people to adjust to these changes.\n\nIf you are aged over 18 and have previously experienced a change in their psychiatric diagnosis (i.e. had a diagnosis removed, replaced, or supplemented with a different diagnosis), we would like to invite you to take part in this study.

    "selftext": "Hi, no diagnosis and no access to therapy right now but having issues that I think DBT would be helpful for - looking for advice from those more familiar with the modules and self-help workbooks on what to call the skills I want to work on and what a good starting place would be for helping myself. Apologies for the very long post.\n\nMy SO and I have recurring conflicts that don't seem to be getting better because a large part of it is due to my over-the-top emotional response. I'm very sensitive to feeling like my SO's full attention isn't with me in conversations or things like not sticking to plans we'd vaguely talked about. There's usually a valid reason for these things happening, and a lot of the time it's because of much much smaller/negligible reasons (for example, I ask him to do something in the kitchen, he checks his phone for 2 seconds on his way to do it). I get really irritated and can't let it go which builds up to a breaking point where I'm rude or mean to my SO - alternatively, he notices I'm in a sulky or bad mood (which is impossible for me to disguise apparently) and asks what's wrong, to which I get more angry/upset because I'm trying to not say cruel things to him.\n\nI'm deathly afraid of disappointing him and him losing interest and leaving. We've tried to discuss the thought process behind these conflicts but a lot of it is emotional and not rational. I never want to bring up what I'm irritated by because I'm scared that he'll be mad and leave. Conversely, trying to deal with these outsized reactions to things that rationally make no difference by myself is obviously not working because I end up being angry and distant for the rest of the day or longer which is frustrating to him.\n\nI think there are two key issues here: firstly I'm not able to de-escalate my own emotional responses which keeps snowballing and causing further conflict. Secondly, I'm so terrified of him losing interest and giving up on me and leaving that when my brain jumps in that direction I completely freeze up and start acting shitty towards him.\n\nFor context, I have a history of self-harm, substance abuse, promiscuity, etc - currently not displaying any of these behaviors since I got into this relationship but have used these to cope when feeling abandoned with other people. My SO has never shown any sign of being disappointed or wanting to leave beyond saying that me treating him like this makes him feel like I don't care about him and makes him not want to be around me. This level of self-awareness on my part is due to him sitting down with me recently after a bad argument that ruined plans and asking questions until I was able to kind of explain the spiraling that happens. We also live together so bottling things up until I can deal with it myself isn't really an option (and in the past \"dealing with it\" has taken the form of unhealthy coping mechanisms so also not great).",

    "selftext": "Has anyone here been using DBT skills to address ADHD symptoms? I haven‚Äôt been formally diagnosed with ADHD as an adult but I was as a child. A lot of change has happened for me during these last five weeks of my DBT program. One of those is a reduction in my Welbutrin which I suspect may be related to the increase of these ADHD like symptoms.\n\nI‚Äôm starting to get really irritated about my focus issues and feel like it is interfering with my ability to practice skills. I am also somewhat startled sometimes with how much I drift off, over and over, every time I draw my attention back to what I‚Äôm doing next thing I know I‚Äôm drifting again. It‚Äôs felt almost dangerous like when driving for example. Also I am starting to feel really incompetent at work and it is affecting my self-confidence and definitely the way people perceive me. I sometimes get going so fast I am pretty sure I don‚Äôt make sense. It‚Äôs embarrassing. \n\nRecently in group we had a really interesting discussion about red zone emotions not necessarily being negatively intolerable, but how distress tolerance skills can be used when a mood is more manic-like. It was said that maybe red zone skills are applicable whenever we feel like we are out of control and can use DT to get down into our blue zone so we can look at changing things. I thought about that a bit today when I was at work and I could feel myself revving up to where I couldn‚Äôt chill out enough to think straight and communicate clearly. I was supposed to be training new employees. There are two kind of trainees I work with: those who find my spazziness charming and still recognize and respect my expertise, and those who dismiss me and make mistakes and I then have to run around cleaning up after them. I‚Äôm starting to reflect and realize how much these things have affected me at work and possibly contributed to me (voluntarily) stepping back instead of up in the chain of management. \n\nAnyway, has anyone used DT to reduce their SUD in this kind of mood? Also the focus issues obviously are challenging during mindfulness practice. Does anyone have any experience or advice about that? What skills do you think might be good to try out? \n\nThanks so much y‚Äôall",

If shes bored of me. Or just the general fear of turning up one day and she decides to break up with me or the paranoia shes cheating on me (cheating has been a recurring thing in all my previous relationships). \n\nI understand that radical acceptance can be used if the worst did happen and that shes her own person and has her own choices. I can also use the COPE AHEAD skill so that I can look after myself and let people know that things aren't great.\n\nBut that crippling fear is still there. It's like I'm always preparing for the worst possible situation 24/7. I'm so afraid of losing her and every minor mistake or little change makes me think that it means the end is coming.\n\nI have done so well with therapy and recovery, I was honest with her about my diagnosis at the start of the relationship and she even said a few months in that she didn't even notice that I had any symptoms, which means all the DBT stuff I have done has been amazingly helpful. Even friends and family have said that I've been doing much better getting myself back on my feet and for the first time in my life I have a sense of identity, I know what job I want, I know what I like and I know where I want to go.\n\nBut losing her is still my biggest fear. It's just ingrained in me that its inevitable. And the fact that I keep mentally preparing myself for the worst is the opposite of DBT surely? As just looking over the potentials makes me feel even worse about myself and if I could even cope losing someone else in my life.\n\nI've learnt who the good and bad people were. I know where I crossed the line and I know where I didn't. I'm doing everything I can to just live a happy fulfilling life. \n\nThis crippling anxiety is going to destroy me and my relationship if I let it continue the way it is.\n\nHas anyone had success with overcoming this fear with DBT? I'd like to know what I can do as I feel really stumped here. Thank you.",

    "selftext": " I was looking at a worksheet I was given in group a while back called ‚ÄúWhat are Dialectics?‚Äù It listed examples of dialectics, such as ‚ÄúWants and needs‚Äù, ‚ÄúRecreation and responsibilities (aka work and play)‚Äù, etc. One example that I never took notice of was ‚ÄúContemplation and Action‚Äù. \n\nI don‚Äôt necessarily think they‚Äôre talking about things like ‚ÄúThinking about joining a gym versus actually signing up for a gym‚Äù. I‚Äôm thinking specifically of cases where some contemplation/thinking *is* necessary, but where it‚Äôs also possible to do too much contemplating/thinking and not enough acting. \n\nFor example I‚Äôve noticed this is something I have a hard time balancing in my school work, and some thinking is definitely necessary when it comes to writing a paper. My major is philosophy, and I‚Äôve gotten in the habit of spending days and days planning papers. I feel like a wise mind thing to do would be to spend a certain amount of time planning, and then mindfully carry that out. What I do is I usually spend a lot of time planning, and what prompts me to transition from planning to writing is something random like getting bored or realizing the paper is due in a day or something. I think that‚Äôs probably more emotion mind than wise mind.\n\nBut as for how much thinking is ‚Äònecessary‚Äô, it‚Äôs hard to say. The problem is that I don‚Äôt always know the difference between how much planning I *need* to do and how much I *want* to do. I enjoy planning things, outlining things, etc., so, it‚Äôs a challenge sometimes to figure out whether I‚Äôm acting from emotion (spending days planning something because I enjoy that) or from wise mind (allowing myself to enjoy it, while also making sure I don‚Äôt overdo it and remember to actually write the paper). \n\nSo I guess my question is: What are some DBT actions I could take to balance between contemplation and action (or between thinking/planning and action?)\n\nI was thinking maybe periodically observing where I‚Äôm at in the process and asking myself ‚ÄúIs there more information I need to research now, or am I just having a hard time transitioning to something more important?‚Äù But I‚Äôm hoping others would be able to offer more suggestions. \n\nThank you!",

Something about knowing that I need this kind of  help with things as fundamental and simple (in theory, not necessarily in practice) as re-framing negative thought patterns and balancing thoughts and emotions to make effective decisions makes me feel more defective as a person than I already do.

I use skills every day to manage, generally several times a day - everything from Mindfulness How and What skills to Cope Ahead and Radical Acceptance, and sometimes by evening time (which I find the hardest) I‚Äôve just run out of energy. \nI have been using Distress Tolerance and Pros and Cons and with them I have been less self destructive/using problematic behaviours since midway through the programme, which is a big win for me. However, at times in the evenings I‚Äôm finding that I‚Äôm struggling to implement those skills. It‚Äôs like I can just about use them to stop the most self-destructive of those but my willpower runs out and I can‚Äôt stop myself from drinking or using other still-problematic behaviours to manage the emotions. Turn the thought and other skills just aren‚Äôt working for me with those behaviours yet. \nI‚Äôve just recently started with schema therapy also and hope that helps on a more long term basis, but does anyone have any advice for this with DBT? Understand it may just take more time and practice, but I recognise as well that I‚Äôm a bit on-edge and that it will cause problems if I continue so any and all support and advice is appreciated.\nThanks all for your help x",

A few days a go I forgot to use the skills and had a even larger destructive episode so my bf decided to break up with me and went NC. This time, I didn't crying all day and self-harming, I use tolerance skills. And I tried to totally accept the moment. I did calm myself down, and stopped from the possibility of indulging in pains. But I still feel there's a sad emotional ball hiding deep in my stomach. I did some quite healthy activities even it's just a short time after the breakup. But I still feel sad about him leaving me. It happened to me before too. Does DBT really works? I just feel like it canned my emotions but it doesn't makes me better. And I feel like next time when I started to feel negative, I'm even more eager to cry, yell, self-harming, just feel trapped so I want to let it all out, let all my past habits of coping those situations kicking in because I feel comfortable when doing it. DBT skills are good, but I couldn't feel as comfortable as letting it all out. And I started to question DBT skills too, don't get me wrong I know I have to do it and quit being destructive and toxic behaviors, but I feel...Bad...Like I'm not free or something..\nI couldn't find any therapists who know DBT. So the only thing I can do is ask here about your past experiences. Just wanna ask, how should it supposed to feel after you use the skills? Will it become more natural and also feels as natural as destructive behaviors if I practice it for a much longer time? Can you share your journey on DBT practice? \nThank you.",

    "selftext": " Ok, so for a long time I‚Äôve been thinking about my ‚Äúinvalidating environment‚Äù\nI read a lot about the consequences of an invalidating environment and they are spot on. Like a slap in the face of oh okay here‚Äôs all the shit you do. But, and I‚Äôm not just saying this out of repression or whatever, I genuinely cannot say that anyone in my  childhood fostered these things. My mother was so on point with mental health treatment from a very young age. It was an open and fostering environment. I was often told I was a special snowflake, that I was ‚Äúgifted‚Äù (in school etc), talented in singing and acting (that was my childhood dream lol). I had good grades and lots of friends.\n\n But I always felt like there was something wrong with me from a very young age because I grew up in a black neighborhood and I am half-Filipino and half white. I never met any other Hispanic or asian kids (this was in the midwest) there were only black kids and white kids and they didn‚Äôt get along. But I didn‚Äôt belong to either group. Then we changed schools. Even though I lived in the more ghetto part of town I went to school in the wealthy part of town. So there was another us/them, good/bad. I won‚Äôt continue to dump details but this theme has continued in a few other big ways in my life. But not because anything anyone ever did to me, because of our life situation. \n\nAgain, my mother was awesome about all of it. She always had an open dialogue about race relations (and I was in like kindergarten lol) and all that. She was a really singular person - she was pretty liberal, very outspoken, very accepting, very smart. She helped me get mental health treatment at a young age because she knew I needed help. She really loved me and told me I was beautiful and creative and smart and unique and I should be proud of myself. My teachers and student peers were the same.\n\nAnyway, the whole point I‚Äôm trying to get to is that when I read about the ‚Äúcharacteristics of invalidating environments‚Äù ...the only person who ever did these things to me is ME. I always told MYSELF I was wrong - even though everyone around me told me I was good and smart and going places.\n\n- I didn‚Äôt consider my needs or special circumstances. I just tried to fit into a box\n- I assumed I should automatically have known how to deal with problems\n- I never helped myself (or got myself the help I needed) when I identified problems. I spent tons of time pouring over things and even when it was clear the problem was real I didn‚Äôt offer myself help.\n- I assumed my expectations were right and that my inability to live up to them was just me being wrong. My negative reactions were evidence of a defect in myself\n- I ignored my ‚Äúrequests‚Äù - what I wanted from myself or for myself. I only responded to my wants when I became intensely demanding - willing the gumption to fight against my natural instinct to deny or minimize my needs.\n\nAnd I mean I kind of get why, because of the us/them thing. And my natural completely black and white perception of the world. I know I am very challenged at developing self-validation skills. I guess I was just wondering if anyone else feels this way - that they are their own invalidating environment. \n\n",

    "selftext": "Hello all. I'm having trouble quitting smoking cigarettes again. I once quit for 9 years and another time for 2 years, both cold turkey. Started again last November due to relationship stress and have tried a million times since to quit. Finally decided to try nicotine patches and gum this time because the withdrawals were just too much. Those help me have almost no withdrawals, but my issue now is I keep going back to smoking anyway whenever in a big fight with my boyfriend or if we're on the verge of breaking up (which is often because I'm constantly starting arguments...the reason I started DBT to begin with). I have now made it to day 5 twice and last week made it to day 14 of not smoking and then went back to it. I wasn't even craving cigarettes. It's like I just get so upset and literally don't care anymore and want to self-sabotage or something. At first, I think I was doing it to try to make my boyfriend care or something, but now I don't even know why I keep doing this. It makes me feel even worse and doesn't help a thing.\n\nI am currently about 7 months into taking a 9-month online DBT course. Unfortunately, I don't have the individual or phone coaching parts though. I've been through distress tolerance, emotion regulation and mindfulness and am a few weeks into the interpersonal effectiveness module. Lately, I've been feeling really unmotivated and hopeless and haven't been trying as hard to work on skills either.\n\nAnyway, I guess I just wondered if anyone had any advice for me to stop this cycle. I know skills I \\*should\\* be using in these times, but it's like my brain gets stuck and I just don't care in those times. I can make it through a lot of other stress without smoking, but relationship stuff has this hold over me.  I'm really sick of having to start over with quitting smoking. Thanks!",

I do see a therapist and I have asked for help with this and she has suggested using DEARMAN to ask for what I need. I‚Äôve told her it has not been working but she does not usually have any advice beyond continuing to try DEARMAN. My partner is also in therapy.\n\nI have ADHD and my partner has ADHD and Autism. This creates a difficult dynamic where they need a lot of space and my rejection sensitivity is easily triggered. I have trouble accepting no when it comes to spending time together. That said, while I am nowhere near perfect, I feel as if I have done a lot of work to accept no with a lot more resilience.\n\nThe current issue is that the amount of space my partner needs since covid has become extreme. I feel like I am in a long distance relationship with someone who lives 15 minutes away from me. I am positive that I am not projecting this distance because it is an issue with some of their friends as well / we have a mutual friend who has mentioned it. They have increasingly isolated themself from everyone and in addition to being frustrated i am also worried.\n\nWhen I try going through the steps of DEARMAN to address this I feel like my partner uses their boundary as a weapon because they are feeling defensive and they accuse me of debating their boundaries or seeing their boundaries as negotiable. Also, because I have admittedly not been good with respecting this boundary in the past they will not believe that is not what I am intending to do again despite how many times I‚Äôve successfully accepted no and been able to self soothe since.\n\nI guess my main questions are: Is it even appropriate for me to tell another person their boundary is actually a wall? is there something else I could be using with DEARMAN here?",

    "selftext": "Hello! I've recently started 1-on-1 DBT therapy and have found it immensely helpful but progress has been slow. I can recognize aspects of me where progress is truly there, but during intense conversations/moments with my SO, I still struggle a lot.\n\nI have a history of lashing out, being mean and hurtful, accusatory and self-harming, which I've been committed to stopping. I've stopped the self-harm and the mean comments, and I don't lash out in an angry way as much anymore, but I feel like because my SO has seen me \"at my worst\" so many times, he's come to expect it despite my best efforts at containing myself in the moment and so he withdraws and becomes cold and defensive as a result. Usually this happens when I'm struggling to express my feelings to him and he feels blamed/attacked, like \"everything is his fault\" (his words) but all I'm doing is trying to explain that [X] thing he did/said hurt me.\n\nSo! I've been trying my best to talk to him about MY feelings and give him the benefit of the doubt, but it's incredibly difficult to do when I can easily cling on to something extremely hurtful that he has said or done during a recent fight that he often feels I have instigated. As a result, I end up wallowing in whatever hurt feeling I'm experiencing and even if he apologizes, I can't sincerely accept it because I feel like whatever innocent remark he made is tinged with resentment (or whatever negative feeling) he has towards me, based on mean things he's said before.\n\nSo where he feels like he's being playful, helpful or innocent, I feel like he's being unnecessarily mean, triggering or manipulative. Does this make sense? \n\nJust yesterday we had some banana bread with coffee. I am recently unemployed and my mom helped me out with groceries, so I wanted to save the loaf she bought me and not eat it all right away. My SO was clearly excited about the bread and said something like \"don't feel like you can't eat the whole thing, since it'll expire\" and I pointed out that there's plenty of time before the expire date (a whole week). In response, he said \"is it really?\" and pointed out times where I've let other foods go bad and had to throw them out. This was back when I was working full-time and struggled with making myself lunch every day and some of the food I had went bad as a result. He's seen me throw out old foods before and I feel very embarrassed about it, so I felt like him bringing that up was a direct jab at something I was insecure about it, and I felt like he was doing it to \"slyly\" guilt me into sharing the entire loaf with him. This makes him sound manipulative and unkind, right? But that's exactly how I felt in that moment.\n\nSo I told him that I felt hurt, the reason why (bringing up my history of throwing out old food) and he apologized. I still felt hurt after he apologized and told him this, and he immediately got defensive and started accusing me of wanting to waste our day off fighting, said how he felt like his apologies were never good enough and how I didn't want to provide a solution. I used DBT skills I learned to stay grounded, not react in an impulsive way like I have before and continued to reach out to him for validation. I explained that I wanted to feel validated and he refused, and made some other mean remarks like \"I should just get going\", rolling his eyes, checking his watch, said he shouldn't feel like \"babysitting me\" all the time. It just kept getting more hurtful with each remark or defensive body language.\n\nI'm still very surprised at myself for not escalating and reacting in a self-destructive manner like I have before, and I'm somewhat proud, but even though we made up afterwards, I still feel very conflicted. I absolutely can't tell if I overreacted and where, and whether I should've just let his comment go. I know if I had accepted his apology and moved on, we wouldn't have had that stressful fight afterwards, but his cold and defensive behaviour as a response to me not letting go feels callous and SO mean, and I think it causes me to split on him more often that not. Right now I am sitting here, stewing on this and feel unloved even though it's our anniversary this weekend.\n\nI really want to make things work between us and I don't know how to get him \"on my side\" when he's like this, because I did everything I could to not put him on the defensive and not to make him feel attacked, but he still felt that way and I feel like he punished me for it by engaging in defensive, hurtful behaviours that he knows hurt me on a very deep level.\n\nIs there anything else I can do? I feel so sad and lost.",

I can manage it pretty well for several days, but after awhile, I get worn down and start getting depressed. Has anyone figured out a way to handle living with someone they butt heads with? I start every day off happy and in a good mood, but I just feel myself slowly losing patience, tolerance and resilience as the day goes on. I just want to move forward and enjoy my life without it being so heavily influenced by someone else every day. Does anyone have any advice or tips that have worked for you in your relationship, especially at home?",

Isn't the point of distress tolerance learning to be okay with feeling uncomfortable emotions? If so,  then doing \"healthy\" coping techniques to push the emotion away seems to be doing the opposite. You're still not tolerating the distress,  just pushing it away in a less messy manner. \n\nSomeone please explain this discrepancy to me? I can't figure it out. ",

I started to practice mindfulness and interpersonal effectiveness skills from the DBT workbook as I don't want to wait to make a change in my life and I am struggling with the dialectic of non-judgement and staying true to your values.\n\nAs part of 'how' skills, you should 'acknowledge your values, your wishes, your emotional reactions, but don‚Äôt judge them' and discriminate but not evaluate. Cringing is evaluating. I am able to register my cringe at something and then do it anyway, and if it is the DBT way then I can force myself to do it. But, doing that makes me feel ashamed. In the past, I have suppressed my cringing in a people-pleasing way and pushed through the cringe to be accepted.\n\nBut for interpersonal effectiveness also asks me to stay true to my values. It is very difficult for me to know what my values are and they change frequently. Cringing is involuntary, it is coming from me, so it seems like a good way to know where my boundaries, preferences and tastes are that stay stable over time. It is almost a physical warning signal of something I don't identify with and don't want to be like.\n\nRecently, a person I wanted to get closer to invited me to join a hobby that I consider cringe, and I ended up declining and I felt a sense of self-esteem afterwards for that decision. My intense cringe in this situation helped me recognise my preference before I knew it was a boundary related to my values, but it also doesn't feel good to judge people.\n\nHas any who has been through DBT thought about this before and what do you do with your cringe when it comes up?",

I see a therapist that took me a long time to trust and open up to, and that alone is helpful. To make a long story short, I;m seeing her to help me guide me through my mental health journey, not for any specific treatment. I have behavior issues and I felt that DBT would really help me, as it was based on Buddhisms' mindfulness, so I went to a mental health place that specializes in DBT.\n\nI took a huge leap and put a lot of faith into the guy I was talking to. He was a hippie dude who looked like he just came out of a van's hamper. I was okay with that, but he told me straight up that if I wanted to be treated by them I had to abandon my therapist and psychiatrist (at the time, I don't see her anymore anyway, another story), this also included any medication I was taking i.e. anti-depressants or anti-anxiety at the time.\n\nIs this normal? We think that they wanted to make sure that they would get paid by my insurance since I already had a therapist, but their claim is that \"if I am seeing someone else, it might contradict with something we said\". I don't believe it. Has anyone ever heart of something like this? It was so \"cult like\" and \"scammy\", like I had to volunteer for Stockholm Syndrome or something, I felt genuine fear after leaving the place. It's really disheartening, because I'm feel like I still have some degree of stewing in suffering and that DBT could have really helped me.\n\nHas anyone ever experienced this type of situation?

Not DBT, but similar format with group and skills. Over the past four months, I have tried several combinations of my old skills + DBT, only DBT, some DBT, only old skills, some of my old skills, all DBT, simple DBT, adolescent DBT, etc... etc... I'm completely excessive and obsessive about *getting it right*... I have translated *all* the DBT handouts and worksheets into my own language and created lots of my own modifications of worksheets and so on and so on. It's out of control and it's kind of taken over my life.\n\nMy pattern is this:\n\n1. Make a \"self-treatment plan,\" dedicate to practicing one skill a week. I know what I'm gonna do and I got this!\n2. Have emotional episode/problem without obvious solution (And how does DBT fix *this*?)\n3. Become unsure that I'm using the right skill/doing it right/that the skill is good enough/that I've thought about it right/that I understand myself right/that I actually need all this/etc... (Losing control)\n4. Make a new plan, modify the skills, dedicate to other skills, find a new point of view, research skills, re-arrange the \"system\", etc. etc. etc. (Re-gaining control by finding the *perfect* plan)\n5. Feel certain that I've got it right; that I understand the essence of my problems and that I've got just the plan to fix them now.\n6. ... and repeat!\n\nUtlimately, I'm spending a lot more time planning how to use skills than I am actually practicing any skills. As soon as the slightest doubt or \"flaw in the plan\" pops into my mind, I get distressed and I have to re-organize the skills to make sure that they're *just right.* What was supposed to be the solution has become a huge problem.\n\nObviously, the goal would be to just practice one DBT skill for a week, use it \"as it is\" without trying to modify it to my ever-changing needs, and see what works.

    "selftext": "I‚Äôve been seeing a therapist individually for DBT for about 5 months now, and I just started in her group about 2 weeks ago. Since the first week of DBT, my therapist has been asking me to do diary cards. We initially started with a paper card, but she allowed me to use an app after the paper cards were seeming to be very inconvenient for me. (I would think to do the diary card but find myself unable to do it if I didn‚Äôt have my binder with me, while my phone is always with me so I can do entries on the go). However, even with using the app, I am having a very difficult time keeping up with the diary card. I feel like I am disappointing my therapist each week when I come in with no diary entries complete, or I have only done 1 or 2 days for that week. Whenever I do complete any diary card entries, it is in the one hour period before my appointment on Tuesday mornings. I can‚Äôt seem to keep up with the idea of doing them every single day. Even worse, I have been stuck in this rut for so long that even when I think to do an entry or I get the reminder notification from the app, I intentionally choose to wait until Tuesday morning to try and remember what my entire week was like. \n\nI do also have ADD and procrastination issues that show up in other areas of my life, and I can‚Äôt figure out how to keep that from affecting my DBT. I know therapy doesn‚Äôt work if you don‚Äôt put in the effort outside of sessions, but I am having some major issues with motivation, and I think I am stuck in a habit loop that I don‚Äôt know how to get out of. I do think part of my issue is that I don‚Äôt particularly like thinking about how my week went and the feelings that I have. I am currently in a romantic relationship that involves fighting nearly every day, and sometimes I don‚Äôt want to reopen that trauma by doing a diary card. Of course, I know it would help me to investigate that, but I just can‚Äôt get myself to do it.\n\nAny suggestions on how to break this cycle of waiting until the last minute (and then literally running out of time to complete more than 2 or 3 days since I start so late) would be greatly appreciated.",

I can't \"stick\" with it.\nI have told my therapist and she knows about the basics of DBT especially mindfulness, so she is helping me with the meditation/mindfulness part.

I thought about making a weekly schedule of skills to use everyday or x days a week, but I'm not sure if that's helpful for this type of therapy - has anyone done a schedule and felt helped, and how did it? \n\nI did finally start a small book to keep with me when I'm out of home. It's basically an A6 notebook where I put basic things that help. I just did it today, so can't say it's helped yet -nervous laugh-  \n\nrandom: I may tell my therapist about these struggles, but the reason I haven't mentioned more about this to her is because I don't want her to think I am trying to do her job which is not the case.

After doing some research about BPD, I've learned that the the prognosis (course of the condition that leads to remission) is very positive for people w BPD. DBT is proven to help us in the more short-term frame, but unless we ALSO learn practical 'adulting' skills-- establishing & maining employment, paying bills/sustainable money practices, grocery shopping, cooking, eating properly, exercise, cleaning, time management, making time for loved ones, and all of the important things that allow for a healthy, balanced life-- unless we learn & consistently implement these skills, we are more likely end up symptomatic and suicidal &or institutionalized. Just stuck in the cycle.. \n\nI'm in a cycle of getting a little better, enjoying the  temporary emotional benefits of that improvement, but then the depression cycle starts all over again because I have not learned these life sustaining skills. This has been my cycle for YEARS. Like, all 16 years of my adult life. \n\nNow, I'm remaining hopeful over here because I'm still new to DBT. After 6 months of skills training, I'm enjoying MAJOR improvements already. But, I'm still not 'adulting' and that is where I am in my recovery process. I must get these skills down. It's nice to have good crisis management & interpersonal effectiveness but if I'm stuck in cycle of reliving the same poor circumstances, my quality of life will just not improve beyond a certain point. I am ready! I'm ready for the next steps. But I don't know how to use DBT this way yet. \n\nI suppose it's all mindfulness? Since dbt teaches us to use wisemind to guide our behaviors, right? For example, I disdain grocery shopping. It's loud crowded & the entire store is set up to make you impulse buy a bunch of shit you don't need. So I've tried only shopping late at night, always have my earbuds with me, and always use my list. But I'm still feeling overwhelmed. Like, will I ever be a person who can take care of my mental wellness, pay my bills, eat properly, exercise, & spend time w loved ones? It's all so overwhelming. I've never been able to consistently do this in my life. But it's the only way that I'm willing to continue living. Has anyone here found the answer(s) in DBT?",

I've gone through most of the green DBT workbook, and while most of the techniques seem kind of basic, it's somewhat helpful.\n\nHowever, a technique I really want to use daily and am having trouble with is thought defusion. For anyone unfamiliar, it's when you're noticing and watching your thoughts come and go using a visualization metaphor: imagining your thoughts as clouds going by in the sky, leaves floating away on a stream, etc.\n\nThe issue is that my thoughts and ruminations tend to be completely three dimensional; that is, I'm imagining myself \"in it,\" embedded in the fantasy of a past or potential future event. \n\nI'm sure I'm probably overthinking this (though that habit is surely what led me here in the first place), but it's extremely challenging for me to frame these thoughts as clouds, billboards passing by, lilypads on a lake, or what have you. In fact, attempting to mentally \"shrink\" or \"flatten\" the thoughts is extremely distracting, especially in a meditation context. It's as though I'm actually focusing on the thoughts more or longer than I already would have. \n\nHas anyone else experienced this? Any visualization tips in this context would be much appreciated!",

I know I should trust how its working for me and that everyone can have their own experiences with things, but all those reviews and post and critiques about it have been getting me down. I am worried that I will start improving from the treatment and when I see all the negative stuff, it will mean my progress was somehow fake?

I have found that one reason this is so bad is I have an incredibly good memory, especially for the things that hurt me. I have found that my memory also allows me to slowly \"put together\" things that were said or happened and paint this one horrible picture about me not being good enough or something that was kept from me etc etc in a way that I think a lot of others would not.

I seem to get stuck at one aspect. Most of the time the problem behaviour (eating without being able to stop until physically sick and beyond) arises when the prompting event is me feeling fat (I actually gained a lot of weight over the last 2 months due to daily binges  so I have a reason for feeling that way). I find myself in a situation when the trigger is always present as I am fat and getting fatter due to binge eating because of being fat. My fitness was always important to me and now I feel awful all the time. I really want to break the cycle (feeling fat => experiencing a wide range of emotions from desperation and anger at myself to self-induced \"motivation\" aka \"I am going to fast for 40 days (or go low-carb or just eat little)\" and false soothing => get exhausted and overwhelmed from highs and lows inside my head => fail to diet  => binge as I am a fat loser => feel awful => same cycle restarts) but I feel like my body at the moment triggers me all the time. Really, I only feel safe while asleep and every waking moment is unbearable. Nothing fits. I cannot leave the house and if I do I start feeling physically sick (I was unemployed for 2 months so didn't really need to leave the house but as I got a job I will have to leave the house regularly from the next week on and I am really scared how I am going to cope with that). How to prevent \"precipitating event from happening again\" (one of the parts of chain analysis) if it seems to happen all the time and the only prevention is to become suddenly thin, which is nonsense??\nHope someone can help me here, I will be grateful a lot.",

Anyway, after the break everyone came back in, but to my surprise instead of apologising profusely, Nancy looked like she would boil over if prodded, and her facial expression pushed my up-till-then managed 40% up to about 80%. Then we went around the room looking for feedback. I was right next to the \"nice\" trainer, who decided to gag me by asking for feedback to be given one after the other in an anti-clockwise direction (i was clockwise next to her) and I just knew that if I had to cope with Nancy's most likely caustic de-briefing, I would lose my shit, so I grabbed the limelight after the person b4 me was finished (the new guy) and gave a short, sweet and quite frankly caustic debriefing myself. I didn't really mean it. I just felt totally burned and wanted to go out with a bang (anyone familiar with that feeling :-)?)...2 weeks later and I was invited to a meeting with the 3 trainers. As it was here in Germany, you can bet I wasn't looking forward to it. Even tho they're all ok people, Germans in gangs tend to go for the jugular, and I was pretty sure my past experiences with such scenarios (oh let's sort out the crazy migrant) would trigger me and it would end up a blood bath. So I talked with my therapist and together we formed a strategy. That is what I would like to share here.\n\n1. Asked that the meeting be only with Nancy ( to avoid being eaten alive)\n2. Asked that the meeting be based on \"Dialoging theory\" (to avoid being shat on by an overly emotional blame-machine)\n\nand 3) Prepared a written speech (so as I wouldn't confuse the issue and wander into dark territory as my emotion rose)\n\nB4 I get going on the details I want to let you know that it went great, and I got rewarded with beaming smiles and warm handshakes, and even a couple of jokes at the end.\n\nSo we compromised on the only Nancy. I think Nancy was literally scared I would destroy her, so we agreed to 2 against 1. As the other skills teacher (the only one who wasn't there on the fateful day) was familiar with Dialoging Theory, she welcomed the idea. Dialoging Theory is based on the idea that each party, instead of seeking blame, simply reveals in detail personal aspects of their personality in an attempt to give the other party detailed insight into them. It develops empathy and also increases trust, and helps the other person understand them better. Both parties must do this otherwise it won't work. It also takes the emphasis off the situation which, in reliving it, rarely helps anyone anyway.\n\nSo after explaining the wonders of Dialog Theory (this is of prime importance) Then I read my speech. I wanted to let the \"non-borderline\" skills trainer know what it is we borderliners are dealing with on average. And I wanted to explain how much incredible energy it takes for us to wade through the shit-pond which is our lives, and even get to skillsgroup every month. I explained how no-one ever ever calls me on my birthday, how my kids never get presents from our extended family, and how glad i am every week to go to skills, and not have been thrown out for a whole 10 months, and how important it is to me. I then listed 8-10 reasons I love skillsgroup. Right at the end I talked about what happened, not in detail and not at all mentioning Nancy, and then I handed over the mic.\n\nNancy looked like she'd fallen off her high-horse, the shock on her face that i didn't punch her in the face verbally was evident, and to be honest, extremely gratifying. She then launched into her prepared speech, which was fact-deliverance, devoid of the feeling I had offered with my speech. Suddenly she looked like a robot whose batteries had gone flat, and she looked at me with this big smile and said something along the lines of - \"but your words were really moving, and i would hate to throw you out of the skills group now!\" so basically my preparedness actually reversed the decision she'd already made to throw me out of the skills group!!!\n\nSo thank goodness I managed to drive my car once more out of a super difficult traffic jam.\n\nAt the end it was all smiles, and my other trainer was beaming at me like I was the prodigal daughter. \"How did this feral cat I met a year ago turn into this deferent intelligent diplomat?\" her smile seemed to say.I was so happy, and have been on a high ever since. Even my drummer dropping out of our upcoming gig didn't dampen my feelings :-P\n\nI hope this story can help those of you in difficulties with their dbt group now or in the future, or facing getting chucked out of a good job or anything to do with authority. Just remember 1st sob story, 2nd list what you like about the place and how you will miss it 3rd take responsibility for your actions without blaming the most annoying people in the room. Good luck!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTldr turned a potentially difficult situation around in a dbt group and got to stay",

    "selftext": "Hey there, I'm looking for advice from any skills group survivors (lol) out there who might be able to help me.... I was loving my skills group for the first 8 months, but people keep dropping out which really buns me out. From week to week you don't know who's gonna be there... And whereas i used to be really happy with the people (whoever came) now there are just 3 regular people, and 2 of them are quite antsy and it's really easy to offend them as they have all these special trigger subjects, but on the other side at least they do their homework and so the learning is at a fast pace. It's just I'm getting the distinct feeling they just don't like me, and yesterday the pressure of that feeling, plus the pressure of having a huge argument with my bf the night b4 just caused me to make a bit of a scene in the middle of the class. It wasn't that bad, i cleared everything up with the help of the group leaders, apologised and then we all talked about our feelings etc., but then at the end where you give fb about how yr feeling BOTH girls said they were feeling terrible, and i got the feeling that they are both super grudge-holders. Since then i went home and had this terrible fight with my bf, which is what caused me to go to the skills group in the first place (i just want to learn to calm the fuck down) and then the littlest one woke on the night twice complaining of earache which probably gets triggered by me and my bf having loud arguments... I'm thinking that skills isn't enough for me. Maybe i should go in the clinic... \n\nTl;dr feeling lonely and unsupported by my fellow dbt skillsgroup members, want to leave, hate having constant arguments with my bf, child showing trauma symptoms from them...\n\nUPDATE: Thanks all of you. This is a really wonderful group. I am amazed and touched by how thoughtful and supportive your detailed comments have been. It motivated me to make contact with one of the 2 *difficult* girls per WhatsApp. That was really great! I did my Dearman and she responded very positively. I am now looking forward to our next group meeting and hoping all will be better. I will keep u updated!!!",

The concepts of reason mind and emotion mind make perfect sense to me. When I start analyzing my thoughts/behaviour, I usually have no problem telling if I am acting out of reason mind or emotion mind. However, I just can't seem to find their integration, the so called wise mind. It's either logical arguments or feelings for me. Daily mindfulness practice doesn't seem to do the trick of finding wise mind either. \n\nAny tips on how to get in touch with wise mind? \nHow did you find your own wise mind? Was it easy? Am I the only one having a hard time with this one?\n\nThank you for your comments. ",
