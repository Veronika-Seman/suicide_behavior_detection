    "selftext": "GUYS ACTUALLY CRAZY VENT WARNING LIKE SO SORRY BUT THIS IS A CRAZY VENT also tw SA, SH, ED, and transphobia also like and other general stuff you can think of probably idk im kinda slow \n\nOk for context by ‚Äúpeople‚Äù I mean both my parents and previous people in my life \n\n- my mom is never proud of me because I‚Äôm growing up to be like my dad and pursuing arts more than education like she did, she does not view me as a valid boy (I‚Äôm trans ftm) she doesn‚Äôt care about my problems if it doesn‚Äôt benefit her to care (usually if it means she can use it as fuel to fight with my dad or use against me later to make me feel guilty) and doesn‚Äôt understand that things like starving purging and sh are really hard to stop she also doesn‚Äôt recognize that my disabilities require support that isn‚Äôt conditional and isn‚Äôt always convenient. Also idk if she really sees me as her kid anymore \n \n- my dad also doesn‚Äôt like that im turning out to be a good person, and also his love and pride in me is extremely conditional, and doesn‚Äôt view me as his son, maybe like his weird not gendered child. Also his support with my disorders and whatever is extremely conditional. \n\n- in the past i dated person X who raped several times , then person y who only dated me because he wanted to be ùìØùìªùìÆùì™ùì¥ùîÇ with me but didn‚Äôt love me, then person Z who was only with me because he has a fetish for trans men and liked that I was skinny (I was starving myself) \n\nSo basically the problem is that I‚Äôm trying to separate how those people view me from how I view myself and how I think others view me. From my mom and dad I got the idea that I am a horrible person and no one should ever praise me for anything and if they do I should hold onto it for dear life. They also kind of pushed the idea that if any guy was ever friends with me he would inevitably take advantage of me later on in life (not wrong). They also invalidated everything I ever told them so now I feel like I‚Äôm lying about everything I say, including this. So basically along with curly hair and brown eyes, from my parents I got a constant feeling that I was lying to everyone in my life, a crushing sense of shame and guilt for just existing and taking up space on earth, and a feeling like I am a useless bad and unlovable person, at least not without something in return. \n\nThen from those other people I learned that if I wasn‚Äôt skinny, and didn‚Äôt sexualize myself, and allow people to treat me like shit and see me only for my body, then I would have no one. I also learned that because I am a shit person according to my parents the only way I will ever get praise from anyone is if I am hypersexual and bring people into my life to objectify and sexualize me and fetishize me even though it makes me feel gross \n\nANYWAYS!!! So this has lead to me feeling completely worthless and like shit, and to this day I still struggle with asking for help with accommodations (autism lol) and I am trying to correct my thought processes but for the most part they mostly follow the train of ‚Äúeveryone who says they love you is going to take advantage of you, and they should, or the time they spent on you was waisted cause you have no other value‚Äù and also I feel like I‚Äôm lying about everything I say and I‚Äôm a horrible person and every nice thing I do is to manipulate people into thinking I‚Äôm good but I know I‚Äôm not \n\nAHHH ok that was a lot to say and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever said all of that before lmao but yeah there you go so basically if anyone has any advice for separating outside views on views on yourself and current relationships please let me know üò≠üò≠üò≠ like I hate this üò≠",

    "selftext": "I hope this is the right sub for this. \n\n**TL;DR - are there any drawbacks to having a 13 year old talk to a psychologist? She's having issues with her mom**\n\nMy husband and his ex have been divorced for 9.5 years and share custody of 2 out of their 3 kids (one is now 18). My 13 year old stepdaughter is having a rough time living with her mom. They clash, a lot, and her mom is a narcissist. Without providing specifics or going into too much detail, there is a lot of guilt tripping, mind games, and withholding basic needs, like food. The 13 year old has tried to talk to her mom about some of these things, but mom plays the victim and if that doesn't work she ignores the 13 year old, sometimes for days at a time.\n\nRecently the mom filed a petition for more child support and my husband was going to respond asking for more custody; either 50/50 or full. But he was notified today that the case was closed, with no changes made to the child support order. We don't know what happened as he hadn't responded yet. Based on some info my stepdaughter recently told my husband, he is concerned with the long term effects her mom's behavior is going to have on her. She was in tears recounting a story from a recent trip they took to visit my oldest stepson at college. It's like mom goes out of her way to be mean and make my stepdaughter feel like crap.\n\nAnyway... my husband talked to a friend that used to work in child support and custody and she recommended we find a psychologist for her to talk to about everything. They said if the psychologist feels there is any abuse/neglect, etc. going on they can get the court involved. I've never talked to a psychologist, even though I probably should; I've got my own childhood trauma. But I want her to know her feels are valid and maybe get some feedback on how to handle some of this. \n\nHas anyone been through something similar? Anyone have experience in the field or have any advice? I know my stepdaughter thinks if she tells her mom she wants to live with me and my husband her mom will freak out. Shes told me before that she doesnt want to have to deal with the fallout after bringing something like that up with her mom.\n\nI don't want her to feel like she has to choose between us or her mom but I know if my stepdaughter's opinion has to be taken into account for custody and her mom finds out what she said, it will be nuclear if she maintains any custody. It will probably be nuclear regardless.\n\nAny insight is appreciated.",

    "title": "ISO tools to help me default to empathy over defensiveness",
    "selftext": "So my spouse (40 F) and I (38 M) have been together 11 years but are in a tricky situation and I need some tools to help me develop knee jerk non-defensive communication habits even when I feel blindsided by intense personal criticism.\n\nBackground: We‚Äôre both actively working through the results of trauma from other earlier times in our lives - but we‚Äôre getting tangled up in a self-feeding cycle that‚Äôs slowing progress and causing a lot of conflict. Whereas I‚Äôm working through processing the violent loss of a loved one, she‚Äôs working on de-programming the conditioning that came out of growing up with an emotionally manipulative / brutally narcissistic father and emotionally absent mother - and her progress has been truly huge.\n\nThe problem: one area where she‚Äôs struggling is speaking up about things that bother her. While she is finding more of her voice, it takes a lot of inner pressure to come out. When it does, it often bursts out with intensity. What she needs from me is empathy, validation, and a sense that it‚Äôs safe to express how she feels - in time, she should be able to do that with less intensity.\n\nIn the meantime, feeling blindsided by intense outbursts can suck but what complicates it is the sharp decrease in positive reinforcement she‚Äôs provided while working on self-empowerment (part of trying to negate her past coping method of fawning in order to placate). Although she‚Äôs recently begun working on balancing that too, intense expressions of displeasure paired with 2-ish years of a lack of positive recognition from my partner has hit my self-confidence pretty hard after a couple decades of PTSD-fueled self-criticism. As this has gone on, at some point I started anticipating feeling like a POS (which I know is not her true intent), so I started reacting to her outbursts of frustration with knee jerk defensiveness instead of empathy. In turn, she feels like I hijack the conflict and gets even more mad, which feels unjust to me and pushes empathy further away. We circle around it until I eventually de-escalate myself and lower the defenses - which allows empathy to flow. \n\nProblem is, that repeated cycle has left her preemptively doubting she‚Äôll be heard without conflict because my defensiveness negates the sense of safety she needs to be free in expressing something unpleasant. While she is trying to do better about providing recognition for positive things, that‚Äôs a pretty new development. I‚Äôve proposed other strategies, like her starting an outburst by saying ‚ÄúI need you to hear me with empathy about this‚Ä¶‚Äù, but that equates to her modifying her communication to placate my hurt feelings - which is a no-go.\n\nSo, what I need are tools, strategies, or practicable skills that can enable me to shift to knee jerk empathy instead of defensiveness, even when I feel blindsided. There are lots of fairly basic things (using ‚ÄúI‚Äù statements, active listening, etc) - but those don‚Äôt pre-empt the emotional flinching on my part. I considered getting an ‚Äúempathy first‚Äù tattoo on my hand that could help me remember not to go to defensiveness - but that may or may not work. Any recommendations on what can help me respond with knee jerk empathy even when it‚Äôs delivered with disproportionate intensity or feels like it strikes a nerve with my tattered sense of self-esteem? \n\n\nTLDR: I need tools that can help me default to empathy-first reactions instead of knee jerk defensiveness when I feel blindsided and initially injured by my wife‚Äôs disproportionately intense expressions of displeasure.",

    "selftext": "*Big trigger warning for suicide and self harm. *\n\nI‚Äôm just unsure of how to go about dealing with this situation that is unfortunately my life anymore. \n\nMy mother (38F) suffers from a ton of mental health issues going from schizophrenia to bipolar to psychosis to paranoia on top of many other things. My family and I (20F) have been doing our best over the years to try our best to help her and keep her on track but the last year has been exceptionally bad. Last year around this time she was in an episode of psychosis, went for a drive, ran out of gas and went missing for 3 days and we had no idea where she was. She was thankfully found and survived as she had been walking around aimlessly and almost got frostbite. I was in my first year of college when this happened and was absolutely distraught to say the least. After that, she started doing better and we were all so proud of her. This winter rolled around, I got done with my semester and came home for break. I knew from talking to her and my family that she was getting bad again but we all didn‚Äôt think it was quite as bad as what happened next. The day after I get back for break, I get my brother (10M) on the bus for school and my dad heads off to work. I proceed to take a nap. I get woken up from my nap to my mother screaming for me to call 911 because she slit her wrists. I sprint downstairs and find a horrific scene. Prior to waking me up, she had went around the whole house getting blood on every. single. surface. to try and ‚Äúcleanse‚Äù the house of demons. I try to help her stop the bleeding as i‚Äôm on the phone with 911 and she proceeds to dump salt into both of her wounds. Officers finally arrive and she tells them she was trying to get the demons out of her. They send her to the psychiatric ward but on top of her being incredibly manipulative knowing what to say to doctors and there being no inpatient beds for her, she was released after only 3 days. We only had a few hours notice. My dad and I were not at all prepared for her to come home and we were honestly scared for our safety and still are. If her delusions get out of control again, we fear she would try to hurt us or potentially see us as threats. I have been seeing a therapist for almost a year now but I‚Äôm just unsure of how to even cope and also help her through this at the same time. I love her dearly, it‚Äôs just getting hard to pick up all the pieces for her and i‚Äôm not sure I have anything left in me to give. If anyone has any advice as to how to help not only myself but to help her through this it would be much appreciated. Whether it‚Äôs certain medications or physical things to do in the moment.",

    "title": "Please help me",
    "selftext": "Hi, 22F here. I've lived most of my life in pain basically. I was physically and emotionally abused until I was 15 and then I was afflicted with mental health disorders. Anxiety being one of them. I currently have Depression, Anxiety, PTSD (suspected), EUPD/BPD (Borderline personality disorder), Depersonalisation disorder, Derealisation disorder and Dissociative disorder. I am currently awaiting DBT and trauma-focused psychotherapy from a psychiatrist but am in CBT currently and have had about 5/6 sessions. \n\n  \nMy issue is that I can't live without pain. I can't deal with having no pain at all. The pain I get from EUPD/BPD is a pain unlike any other. It's a searing pain in my chest that feel like someone lit my insides of fire and then poured alcohol on them before dousing the rest in acid. It hurts so much and I'm glad I at least know now about what it is. If I don't feel the pain, I feel like I'm faking it which is frustrating. If I don't feel any pain, my anxiety becomes triggered until I do something to calm myself down. For example, last night- my anxiety starting picking up for no reason until I pinched myself really really hard and only THEN was I able to calm down and sleep. \n\nI have always relied on pain to help myself because when I was younger and being physically abused, if I cried then I would just get hit even more. So, to counteract that, after a beating, I would pinch myself or bite my tongue really hard to keep me from crying or making any sort of emotion at all. I would keep myself as neutral as possible to avoid a further beating. I was sexually abused as a kid too, I don't know if that's anything. \n\nI seriously don't know whats wrong with me and what to do with it. I'm so on edge and constantly unsettled and I have no idea why. I have a friendship now where we consider each other family and he means everything to me and he's amazing and has accepted everything and wants to genuinely help me get better but why does that set off alarm bells. The more amazing I realise he is, the worse my anxiety and BPD gets. It's like I want chaos and I want pain and I have no idea why. I know I find comfort in the pain and darkness but its just not fair.\n\n  \nAnd, I haven't been able to work because I haven't been able to keep a stable job. I wasn't supposed to make it this far so I messed up school and experience because I wasn't supposed to live this long. And, now life stresses me out so much because I am not doing anything. I constantly try to tell myself that its okay if I'm a little behind, I will end up doing something soon. I do want to be able to keep a stable job and earn money because its hard being on disability but I am currently comfortable on disability. (my mental health is so bad, it counts as a disability). I am currently in CBT, awaiting trauma-therapy and DBT and the idea of work stresses me out but my parents hate that. They keep forcing me to work, saying that 'i should be better by now'. I mask more and trying to navigate life and grieve everything whilst dealing with the intense pain of EUPD and everything else is just a lot and its so hard. Right now, I can't even enjoy anything I usually enjoy because my brain is constnatly like 'what will i do after this?'. like 'this show is something i enjoy but it will end soon, and then what?' and I feel like even if I do work, the same thing will happen. Its a constant cruel cycle of anxiety that just keeps building and building and I don't know what to do. Its so horrible because people like my brother (who SA-ed me btw) look at me as if im a burden for having mental health issues but with the amount of trauma ive been through, I dont get how I couldn't have it. He doesnt beliebe in mental health and fakes being worreid about me because I cant work at the moment. They all think I'm being lazy for not working when I'm barely trying to survive. I get forced to do chores and that takes energy that i need to use to take care of myself. My parents always blame me and call me lazy and stuff because I don't have the basic energy to even take care of myself and my hygiene, let alone household chores. They are pushing me down even more and showing me no compassion. Because I don't work, I don't have an option to move out yet. All my benefits go towards therapy because I really need the sessions to live. I don't know what to do. Life stresses me out so much and I don't know why. Its gotten me so close to wanting to self harm. I feel like I'm going backwards and this is all so painful and im grieving constantly and I don't know what to do. And, then when i don't feel the intense pain from the Borderline, then my brain will scream at me that I'm faking it and that I don't actually have it when I know that I do, I just am used to dissociating from any sort of pain. I don't know what to do. I feel so horrible and so bad and so anxious. Like, I'm constantly on edge and nothing is helping to take that edge off and I don't know why. I've been on Fluoxetine (Prozac) 20mg for about 5 weeks now and Propanolol 40mg 2x a day for about 4 months now. Granted, I did forget to take my medication last night but I took it as soon as I realised which was about 8 hours ago so I feel like it should have kicked in by now. I did go about 12 hours over before I realised I hasn't taken it so a 36 hours gap between doses. I'm not sure though, please help me",

    "selftext": "I am a 20F, back in high school I had a really bad circle of friends who I knew since middle school and I didn‚Äôt even know didn‚Äôt like me. When Covid happened it gave me time to kind of reinvent my self esteem, later when I attended my senior year in person the same group of friends were back to treating me as a joke, when I finally stood up for myself they went behind my back and made a zoom meeting about me, then the next day at school they all confronted me about my change of attitude and called me weird and all stopped talking to me except one. I kept her around because she understood that they all jumped me metaphorically and it was unfair and that she talked to them all afterwards but I knew she wasn‚Äôt innocent either bc she was there and not only allowed all 8 of them to do that but didn‚Äôt stand up for me either. Ever since then I‚Äôve been very hyper vigilant on who I speak to, kept to myself and only focused on investing in myself. When college came around I stayed that way even my dorms mates actually told me that they valued the way I stayed out of drama. Unfortunately I let myself get attached to one of my dorm mates because I saw my old self in her since she had just got disowned by her mom. My mother kicked me out at 17 and I literally had no one and this was the time period where my high school friends stopped talking to me. I wanted to be a person she could lean on since I understood that feeling and wish I had someone who did the same for me. She got accepted as RA the next year and before that her own friends that she had been friends with for over a decade started being weird towards but also took advantage of her as well. Me and her just grew close and she picked me to be her roommate for her RA dorm. Our friendship was good, we did have problems sometimes bc we would be with each other 24/7. I was the only one with a car so she leaned on me to take her to work sometimes or school. For context as well I like to thing of myself as a humorous person I like to make people laugh that‚Äôs just my personality but I didn‚Äôt notice that our small group of friends took my personality as consent to disrespect me and my boundaries. I started to notice when I would make a mistake it was held against me but nevertheless I took accountability, I hate hate when someone doesn‚Äôt take accountability for there actions so I make sure even though that was not my intention to hurt someone‚Äôs feeling I still made them feel that way so I take responsibility and apologize and reevaluate my actions. I make sure I do that with every friend I had since I know what it‚Äôs like to be pushed around I never want to make someone else feel that way too. I started to notice that with my personality they started to not take me seriously like when I tell them not to leave trash in my car or when I started going broke that I needed gas money when they wanted to go to Walmart or another store. Recently I cut a guy friend off bc he disrespected my room by farting on my bed on purpose and the RA friend who likes to tease me with her feet ( I never thought she would go this far) said that she was gonna rub her feet on my pillow while I sleep and they both went in my room teasing me, he did fart on my bed and the RA just laid there teasing me that she was gonna do it. I told them both that it was enough and that I would never do that to them so why would they do that to me. I told them to get tf out and even then they didn‚Äôt take me seriously. The next day the guy came and asked if I was actually upset and I told him why I was and he did not take accountability and actually switched the narrative and blamed me. That it was my fault that he did that and that I also cross his boundaries but he doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúbitch like what I was doing‚Äù. He then asked me to take him to Walmart with a SMILE. I knew he didn‚Äôt take me seriously from then on and when I ignored him, he blew up on me and called me a little girl and told me to act my age. ( he‚Äôs one year older than me). I blocked him on everything, I told our mutual friends that I‚Äôve cut him off for disrespecting me. The RA however literally ignored me for days when we lived literally next to each other, I blocked her after a couple days bc it was ridiculous, if she cared she would have just asked but she later told me she was afraid of confrontation, I asked her during this conversation if I‚Äôve ever manipulated, gaslighted, cursed, or raised my voice at her, she replied no and I asked her again why. At the end of the conversation she didn‚Äôt really care about our relationship she was more focused on us being respectful roommates and peacefully coexisting. I was fine with that since the conversation gave me clarity that she just wanted a person she can get rides from. A month ago, remember that guy friend I cut off, yeah well, both the RA and that guy were plotting on my assault like I was at work ( 10-12hr shifts). When I came back from work at 6pm I usually take a Benadryl and force myself to sleep at 8 to wake up at 4am. But I got out of bed to go to the bathroom on a different floor since our personal bathroom didn‚Äôt have toilet paper and our floor bathroom was dirty, when I came up the ex guy friend came up to me in a ski mask and said he was gonna fuck me up for what I said about him which I was confused bc I haven‚Äôt said anything disrespectful other than me cutting him off for disrespecting me, invading my boundaries and asking me for a ride bc he doesn‚Äôt have a car. I was really tired so I headed back to my room but then he ran to my room where my RA roommate opened the door for him ( I know this was stupid but I followed him into my room bc I thought he wasn‚Äôt actually gonna hit me bc he had too much to lose) I saw my roommate and our other mutual friend waiting there for me. That‚Äôs when he just started punching me. Before this all started I had planned to move into my own place to start new, I did tell my RA roommate and this happened two day before I was supposed to move out, he shouldn‚Äôt have known the date unless someone told him. I believe it was a set up since they both hid him when I called police. I know this is a lot to read but I don‚Äôt know how to move forward from this I don‚Äôt really care that I was physically hurt but that these were people that I genuinely cared about since I had spare money I made sure that they both had food to eat. I even used my college fund for things for them instead of paying my tuition, none of them have a vehicle so I‚Äôm the one who was taking one of them to work and the rest to other places. I never asked for anything except respect. I don‚Äôt know how to trust someone again, when I found out he was posting me since he‚Äôs a bit of a social influencer on twitter, making fun of me for calling 911. Idk how to react, I‚Äôm hurt that I genuinely loved them and to think that they hated me so much they wanted to hurt me. Idk I don‚Äôt feel lonely but I feel scarred, I never want to trust people again, I don‚Äôt feel like myself, I feel like that dumb high schooler who let her group of friends push her around again. I need some advice, thank you for reading this, even though you might not feel like it‚Äôs a lot, I truly appreciate you all who reads this fully. Please help me with some advice, I though of asking for medication that can either numb my emotions or help me forget but I feel like I‚Äôll get locked up for something like that, idk I‚Äôm just trying to get past this.

During one of these sessions I realised I was actually sexually assaulted as a child and never realised. It was hard to process at first since I had never thought of it as that, because we were both kids (they were a little older), it was with clothes still on, and throughout my childhood SA was displayed a particular that was never close to the scenario that happened to me. \n\nBut as a result I was a hypersexual kid, had bad relationships with my mum (caused by said hypersexuality) and have been afraid of intimacy with other people.\n\nI would like to reiterate that i really really really like this guy im dating. But the thought of needing to explain im a virgin is nerve-wracking because.... well... when you say you're a virgin sometimes some guys (yes, i know, SOME) can get a bit weird with that info. I know this guy isnt like that but we never know. Second is my trauma hasn't exactly gone away - because it's a relatively new discovery it's like my healing process has restarted. I was dealing with things before I realised i was SA'd but now that i have it feels like the healing process has restarted. Plus, its lowkey a reason why im still a virgin (though it makes it sound like 19 and being a virgin is uncommon - which its not)\n\nI know i could tell him, but i also dont need him to really know this info.

What im trying to say is that no one but me and my therpist know about my SA and i want to keep it that way because it feels better when no ones else know - like it becomes fact and *real* once i twll someone.\n\nBut, again, it feels like it might affect things with this guy i want to keep going with.\n\nThoughts?",

    "selftext": "It seems, as I get older,  I have more and more of an issue with excessive Talking.   I can't do as much physically exerting work, as I once could, but I still have the same mental energy.\n I either get anxiety, or I am excited to be around people.  My mother was an anxious talker and my dad loved to talk.  I feel that I have both of them in me.  The first time I spoke to my then girlfriend on the phone, we talked for 3 hours.  I believe that having her  sitting here beside me, 35 years later, it is because that ability to stay engaged in conversation with her, made her believe that I really liked her.  I did really like her, however I think that it was the only time that Talking paid off for me.  \nI feel that medications can make it worse.  They almost never help.  My Armour Thyroid medication  builds up in my system and I can become full blown manic.  I have to stop it for a few days, once I realize it is making me talk excessively.  I also take Contrave for weight loss, it gives me a little energy and that coupled with caffeine and the occasional 5 day course of Prednisone, can really effect my personality. \nI don't know if anyone else has this problem.  I would like to find a medication that would help me.  Even pain medication makes me talk too much.  I once took a dose.of Phentermine.  A nurse that I worked with asked if I wanted to try one; I was telling her that I wanted to lose weight.  Everyone new that I was a talker, so when that medication hit my system, I sat there and listened to the aides and nurses talk for hours.  I didn't say a word for hours and I felt the most tranquil and and almost euphoric.  It felt so good.  Now, I was put on that medication, by my primary care provider and it never worked that way, not even once.  It made me at least as bad, if not a little worse.  I really don't understand why it worked at all.  Maybe due to her capsules being a different company and therefore formulated differently.\nI have always felt uneasy around new people ,or in certain settings.  As a child, my grade school was closed and the children were split into two groups, one group was sent to a lower middle class neighborhood elementary school, and the other half to an upper middle class and upper class neighborhood elementary school.  We were bussed from our projects neighborhood to that school.  No child had ever attended that school, from lower class areas.  We were mentally abused. The one treatment that stuck with me the most, the silent treatment.  Now, when I am with people at work or other venues, if there is silence, I get uncomfortable.  Since most people are quiet, that means that I need to talk, to feel comfortable and accepted.  \nChildhood trauma.  It took me years to realize it.  From ages 6 to 10, I had three difficult life events happen.  That is a lot for a child.  At 6, two twin boys that were 8 years old and my brothers classmates, they came to ask us to sneak off with them, my brother told them \" no, mom won't let us.\"  Those boys were kidnapped and tied up to the posts in a garage and burned.  The police think it was to cover up the murders.  Not sure if they were alive during the fire or not.  Their mother came to our apartment looking for them.  We told her that they said they snuck out of the kitchen door and the babysitter didn't know they were gone.  Next thing that happened, they closed our school when I was 8 or 9 and transfered us to the new school.  Then one day in  August 1977, I heard on the radio that Elvis died, so I ran home to tell my dad.  6 days later, still August, my brother woke me up, to tell me that dad was dead and that mom had found him dead in bed.  Then I had to face those mean upper classed kids at school, with no dad.  Boys need their dads.  \nI feel I may have had PTSD for years and have been suppressing feelings.  Anyone else have experienced any of these problems, or have a problem with talking to excess?  Any medical treatments that you know of?  Any positive feedback is welcomed. Thanks. ",

    "selftext": "My old beat up civic was broken into a little over a month ago. I woke up to an alarm and saw the guy finish up ransacking my car and take off. The thief probably was enticed by the visible fishing gear in the car. 2 weeks later, I had to give my civic to my parents due to their 2nd car breaking down and unable to afford to buy one. So, I bought a car instead.\n\nI am paranoid and anxious that someone will break into my car again. That image of seeing the thief in my car is still clear in my head. The first week, I barely got any sleep. I would wake up a couple times a night to see if there‚Äôs anything suspicious in our apartment lot (my apartment unit faces the lot). It got better a little bit. I still get anxious and paranoid. After the sun sets, I am constantly looking out my window to see if my car is OK and if there are any suspicious people/cars in the lot. I do myself a massive disservice by reading stories of car break-ins/theft on Reddit (I‚Äôll stop doing that!). If I still had my old beat up civic, I think I wouldn‚Äôt be as anxious. I empty my car every day and make sure I lock it. \n\nFor those who experienced anything similar, how did you cope and get past anxiety, paranoia and the trauma? And tips and advice?\n\nMoving to another area for more peace of mind is an option. Lease ends in March.",

    "selftext": "Whenever someone finds out about my trauma they almost always end up very upset and needing me to calm them down or coax them through it. It is the strangest thing to me and I am wondering if others experience this. \n\nFor example: I have been in a relationship with my partner for 3.5 years. When I first shared my trauma with him and he had a big reaction, I reasoned that it was normal given what I told him. To hear that crap for the first time and freak out is understandable, but as our relationship has continued he will occasionally break down about it and need me to reassure him I'm okay. It's kind of sweet but also makes me feel weird. \n\nIt happens with family, and friends. I understand people react this way out of care, but I am tired of reliving the emotional distress over and over again. I really don't know how to stop it from happening. I avoid talking about it as much as possible for others sake. I am pretty selective with who I tell. I always lead by explaining that I have worked through it and it is in my past. However time and time again people struggle to leave it with a simple 'Im sorry you went through that', or 'Let me know if there's anything I can do to support you'. It's instead always the opposite and I end up in a supportive role to them.\n\nDoes anyone else experience this, or is it just the type of people in my life? What are some things I could say in the moment that is polite but also gets people to realize how inconsiderate their reaction is? It would honestly just be nice to know I'm not the only one that experiences this. \n\n(I do not want to discuss my trauma, just people's reactions to it. All you need to know is it happened when I was young and I have done the work to get past it many years ago.)\n",

    "selftext": "I'm F14, and my father aswell as my twin sisters exsiastance have ruined my mother's life.\nMy father is a scumbag, a man who I have fought tooth and nail to love, he's a violinist a pretentious man who always blames his mistakes on my mother, and has mentally tormented her since the day they met. He has cheated on her twice in there teen years. My mother grew up with a exstemely abusive mother, who constantly hurt her, mentally more specifically, she spent her childhood/teen years working studying her life away. Alot of things happend to her, when she married my father and even before that his parents my grandparents, my grandfather died and I'm exstemely thankful for that, my reasoning being have done nothing but make her life harder then it is. When we were born her mother (my grandma) came to help out and they kicked her out, the second my mother needed her parents support most they kicked them out of are apartment, my mom instead of resting cooked, and cleaned and did everything while my father's parents did nothing to help. After we grew older my mom ended her career, she never finished collage, she didn't have the money too, she had to take care of us, so she did, and that's when she stated hitting us, yelling at us for the smallest mistakes, making the same mistakes her mother did, my childhood, my early childhood was a mess. I found myself taking care of my mom thew her meltdowns her panic attacks it was always us. Never my father, he didn't know how to take care of such things. Needles to say my childhood had alot of ups and downs, alot. My mother's health also declined, she hated herself even more, her appearance changed she changed, my mother had a period where she would fainy alot I remember those nights were I'd find my dad yelling and screaming trying to wake her up, I was in the 2 grade, that's when I started to self harm, I didn't understand what self harming ment, but hey I'd scratch my arms praying to Jesus to take my mother's pain away almost daily, it went on for a month and afterwards a couple of years after I became nothing short but hateful towards Christianity, felt nothing but disgust, and while I don't have those feelings anymore being religious isnt something I'm interested in being into anymore. Anyways back to my mom, my mom just became worse over the years, more vulnerable.. I love my mother so much, I love her more then anything in the world and the more I mature the more I realised how much she has gave up for me, for us, I can't ever be mad at her, I don't think Ill ever be able to live without hearing her voice or looking at her damaged hands. My mom really dose love my father aswell. But he has become more emotionally unavailable as of late, he has alot of work, he constantly comes home and putting on some act of being happy. Capitalism is eatting away at everything, inflation is worsening and even if we have a stable income my mother can't afford to go to therapy or anything that will make her life fulliling. I'm aware that I'm a child, and that I can virtually do nothing but I just really need ideas on how to go about this. \nSorry if my English is poor, it's not my mother lenguage ",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\nI had something really intense happen today, and I just need to share it and process it.\n\nThis morning, I went on a New Year‚Äôs Day hike with a group of people. It was my first time hiking with this group , and everything was going fine until about 2.5 miles in. During a break, our hike leader, Dan, mentioned he wasn‚Äôt feeling well. He said he felt nauseous, then things quickly took a turn. He started having trouble breathing and said he thought he might be having a heart attack.\n\nSomeone called 911 immediately, but before help could arrive, Dan began seizing. It was terrifying. The 911 operator instructed us to start chest compressions. A woman named Kate began CPR, and after a few minutes, I took over and continued chest compressions for what ended up being about an hour, as emergency services were delayed due to our remote location.\n\nIt was exhausting‚Äîmentally, emotionally, and physically. I just kept telling myself, ‚ÄúEvery second counts. If I stop, it‚Äôs over.‚Äù I had learned CPR years ago in Boy Scouts and never thought I‚Äôd need to use it, let alone in a situation like this. The adrenaline kept me going, and I felt determined to continue until paramedics arrived, especially since I felt I was in better shape to keep up the compressions than some of the older hikers.\n\nIn the middle of all this, about 20 minutes in a guy in the group said something completely inappropriate: ‚ÄúDo you think he‚Äôs dead already?‚Äù I was so angry that I started cursing at him and told him to leave. I just couldn‚Äôt believe someone would say that when we were literally fighting for Dan‚Äôs life.\n\nWhen the paramedics finally arrived, they took over and said it didn‚Äôt look good given how long Dan had been down. They transported him, but later I found out that he didn‚Äôt make it. I‚Äôve been feeling gutted ever since. Even though I know we all tried our best and started CPR immediately, it‚Äôs hard not to wonder if I could have done more or if doing something differently might have changed the outcome.\n\nThis was my first time meeting anyone on this hike, and it was such a surreal and heartbreaking experience. I‚Äôve talked to my parents a little, but they don‚Äôt really understand, and I‚Äôm not sure how to process it. I feel emotionally numb right now but also keep replaying the moments in my head‚Äîthe sweat pouring off me, Dan‚Äôs face turning blue, and just the overwhelming hope that what we were doing would work. This is my first real experience with death right in front of me.\n\nI‚Äôm sharing this here because I don‚Äôt really know where else to turn. If you‚Äôve ever been in a situation like this, how did you process it? Did it take time for things to sink in?\n\nThanks for reading‚ÄîI just needed to get this off my chest.",

    "selftext": "Hi all\n\nI'm really struggling right now\n\nI 34 (f) was in a relationship with my ex 33 (m) fir 7 years. 2 years into the relationship we bought a house together, a year later he proposed, a further year later I got pregnant. It wasn't planned but it wasn't an accident. My ex is in the military so was away a lot but I never complained.\n\nApril 2024 I found out he had been having an affair since October 2023 (so he says). His reasoning keeps changing, originally he said he lost sexual desire for me since i birthed our daughter, then he said to his brothers it was because of my depression and autism which he barely saw, then it's because i didn't stuff around house. Problem was he never told me he was having problems.\n\nI did stuff around the house. He was away for weeks and months at a time, I gave up my career to raise our daughter since he was away all the time. I dud the pregnancy on my own, I did the birth on my own, I raised her on my own. I never once complained. I kept the house tidy considering the fact I had a baby, a dog and a cat. I didn't dust which was apparently a problem but he never expressed this to me. I had no idea he was unhappy.\n\nWhen I found out I called her and she was so disrespectful to me. She knew about me and our daughter the night they met and on the night they met they had sex. He was having sex with her then sex with me when he was home. \n\nHe split with her to stay with me but he left a week later. I found out recently he is back with the mistress which I suspect he had rekindled immediately after he \"left\" her.\n\nNow he's trying to pay as little as possible for maintenance. Claiming he has our daughter 2 to 3 nights a week. He barely has her one night a week. Next year he's going away for 7 months straight but he still lied to mediator and said he has her 2 to 3 nights a week which significantly reduces the payment to me. He's been trying to force me to sell the house despite the fact it would make me and his daughter homeless because he wants the money to get a new house with his mistress.\n\nThis Christmas he was supposed to be home for a set period of time but has decided to go and spend a week with his mistress rather than using that time to be with his daughter. His daughter barely recognises him. She knows he's her dad but she opts to fo to anyone but him. He has such little time with his daughter yet he wants to give up a whole week to be with the woman who destroyed our family.\n\nJust to be clear I have no feelings romantically for him. I am struggling to cope with the betrayal, the loss of the relationship and what I had worked hard on. The sacrifices I made. I feel worth less. I'm extremely body conscious now. I'm double questioning what I did so wrong. I can't get out my head the pain I feel for my daughter. I keep thinking about the mistress who is the cat who the got the cream (albeit the curdled rotted sour moldy tainted cream)\n\nHe tries to blame me saying he's just complying with my wishes as I don't want his mistress and our daughter meeting yet so it's my fault that our daughter is losing out on her dad. I'm not dating as I can't since I put my daughter first.\n\nThere's so much more to this. But down to the reason of this post.\n\n2 days ago I was at a point of mental crisis. I have never been that close to calling emergency services because I had lost control of my depression and I was crying uncontrollably and hyperventilating and I couldn't stop (my daughter wasn't there during this). Luckily my uncle came round as I had contacted him for help. I would like to point out that despite what it might seem I'm not a dramatic person. I have never once called emergency services for myself in my life. I hate drama, I hate conflict, I hate pain.\n\nI did manage to overcome the split but I spiralled significantly when I found out he was back with her.\n\nI am now suffering from insomnia... it's 2am for me right now and although I have slept its been broken and full of nightmares. This is a regular now. During my waking hours if I don't successfully distract my brain it will quickly run away with flashbacks of the trauma. It will flood simultaneously of self deprication, thinking of possible future issues and conflicts, thinking of past conflicts and the topic ranges constantly from him, to mistress, to me, to our daughter. I am having like 10 movies fighting for my attention at same time and I cannot shut it off!\n\nMy usual distraction methods aren't working. I am being poisoned by my own mind! \n\nI am desperately trying to get my brain to switch perspective but I'm in so much pain.\n\nTherapy will take at a minimum of 10 months waiting time, I'm already on medication for depression and ADHD, I have a psychiatrist who checks on on me.\n\nI am desperate reddit. Logically I know he's not worth this torment and torture. Emotionally I cannot stop the hurt from the betrayal. \n\nIt's hard to explain.\n\nBut what I'm searching for is coping mechanisms! Advice and support as I am very quickly losing this war with myself.\n\nThe only beacon in my life is my daughter. Which is a massive beacon!!! The love I have for her is immeasurable. The guilt I feel for letting her down is equally so. \n\nPlease reddit.\nHelp me if you can\nI am desperate üò≠ üò´ üò© \n",

    "title": "A Dynamic Energy Model of the Brain: How Trauma, Stress, and Exer",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI‚Äôm currently finishing my aerospace engineering degree, and I‚Äôve been navigating my own mental health journey, including chronic stress and trauma recovery. Through **self-applied Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**, **exercise**, and **deep reflection**, I started noticing patterns in how my brain reacts, adapts, and conserves energy.\n\nAs an engineering student, I couldn‚Äôt help but see parallels between **dynamic systems, energy conservation principles, and how the brain functions**. I‚Äôd like to share some realizations I‚Äôve had.\n\n# ‚öôÔ∏è 1. The Brain Operates in Three Dominant Modes:\n\n1. **Mental Mode (Conscious Thought)**\n   * Energy Cost: **High**\n   * Function: Problem-solving, planning, introspection.\n2. **Subconscious Mode (Beliefs, Habits, Patterns)**\n   * Energy Cost: **Moderate**\n   * Function: Automates behaviors, emotional responses, beliefs.\n3. **Animal Mode (Instinct, Survival)**\n   * Energy Cost: **Low**\n   * Function: Physical reactions, autonomic functions, fight-or-flight.\n\nThese modes are **interconnected yet distinct**, and energy flows between them depending on our mental and physical states.\n\n# üîÑ 2. Trauma and the Brain as an Energy Trap:\n\n* Trauma creates **\"deep energy wells\"** in the brain.\n* These wells are **high-energy states** requiring enormous energy to maintain.\n* Healing from trauma requires an **equal or greater energy investment** to \"climb out\" of these wells.\n\n# üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 3. Exercise as an Energy Redistribution Protocol:\n\n* During exercise:\n   * **Mental Mode** quiets down.\n   * **Subconscious Mode** stops its energy-intensive defenses.\n   * **Animal Mode** dominates (most energy-efficient).\n* Different types of exercise interact with brain modes differently:\n   * **Repetitive Rhythmic Exercises** (e.g., jogging, walking): Deep subconscious accessibility.\n   * **High-Intensity Exercises** (e.g., martial arts, sprints): Emotional release.\n   * **Gentle Movements** (e.g., yoga, tai chi): Balanced reconnection between Mental and Animal modes.\n\nExercise can **bypass subconscious defenses**, allowing emotions and patterns to surface without resistance.\n\n# üìä 4. Mathematical and Engineering Analogies:\n\n* **State-Space Models (Control Theory):** Visualize brain mode dominance as shifting \"states\" influenced by external inputs (e.g., CBT, exercise).\n* **Energy Optimization Algorithms:** The brain seeks the **\"path of least energy resistance.\"**\n* **Entropy Dynamics:** A sedentary lifestyle reduces mental \"entropy,\" making subconscious patterns rigid. Exercise restores energy flexibility.\n\n# üß† 5. Healing Process Observations:\n\n* **Mental-Subconscious Bridge:** CBT works best here.\n* **Mental-Animal Bridge:** Somatic therapies and exercise help here.\n\nTrauma often disrupts these bridges, but intentional interventions can **restore communication between these modes.**\n\n# üåü 6. Why Am I Sharing This?\n\nThese observations helped me understand my own recovery process, and I think they might help others reframe their struggles.\n\n* Does this resonate with anyone else?\n* Have you noticed similar patterns in your experience with stress, trauma, or recovery?\n* Are there existing scientific models or theories that align with these observations?\n\nI‚Äôm also considering exploring this further in a **scientific article**‚Äîyour feedback would mean a lot.\n\nThank you for reading, and I‚Äôm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. üöÄ",

He said no and kinda just held me down until he finished and then kicked me out of the car to walk home. When I got home I was definitely bleeding down there and my back has been hurting bad all day.

I‚Äôm not really sure how to process any of this, I feel oddly numb but at the same time I wanna like rip my skin off.

    "selftext": "I have frozen into **emotional numbness** (non-drug related) as a form of trauma since twenty-seven, and haven't found a modality either capable of helping, and/or (equally important) willing to, meaning that, in over twelve years of hunting via places like Psych Today and BHR, I have yet to even talk to a true trauma specialist.¬†¬†\n\n\n\nTrouble is, most therapies (Cognitive Behavior, I'm looking at you) may deal with‚Äîbut don't specifically focus on‚Äîemotional numbness, and thus I am more than a little leery, and am thus looking out of state for experts, because evidently, anybody who actually understands my issue is very rare, and having to break in a random talk therapist is both tedious and infuriating.¬†\n\n\n\nBasically, in my early twenties, I had ongoing systemic trust issues with my family,¬† and didn't find my mother supporting my authority with my brother, but when I went to my pastor, he ignored my anger over the pattern of abuse, all the trust issues, and just told me to forgive her like it was like a single incident, and not anything ongoing.¬† I got mad, repeatedly seeking out emotional support from both him and others, but got none.\n\n\n\nThe pattern I got into was this:¬† I would ask for validation of my criticism of my mother, and be declined.¬† I would then get angry, lash out and then my audience would distance itself.¬† I would then back off, and then my audience would reengage.¬† I would then again seek support, and the whole situation would restart over again.¬†¬†\n\n\n\nOver about a year I shut down my feelings after failing to get any support or validation, for my desire to punish. Being lectured to forgive just felt like a slap to my face, yet being unable to express my rage constructively,¬† didn't forgive, I just shut down, given I (a) I didn't want to hurt anyone, and (b) I wanted not to be isolated, but it has come at a TERRIBLE price, and most counselors can't relate to my frozen fury, and the counselors who have tried to can't seem to resonate.¬† I want to take action, wanted to take action, yet no one can resonate to it, I'm afraid.\n\n\n\nIdeally, I have sought a therapist I can roleplay with as my sparring partner, or alternatively, engage in psychodrama, but *only* from (a) one experienced in psychodrama, and (b) is capable of handling someone getting angry in the course of therapy without backing off, yet also knew how to stand his ground, but professional ethics have prevented them from aiding me thus, and as a result, I am seeking a volunteer.¬†\n\n\n\nEssentially, all I want from a sparring partner is someone who will show up to official therapy sessions wherein my normal therapist can both referee, as well as do what normal shrinks do.¬† Mirroring the events leading to my trauma, I aim to assert control by expressing anger, getting in my sparring partnert's face, expressing anger by yelling at said someone, thereby challenging him to back off, which per the rules of the interaction, he cannot of course do, no matter how much he wants to, no matter how much I bait him into cowardly disengaging.¬† Once my sense of control and respect for my prerogative has been established, I will indeed back off, but not before.¬†¬†\n\n\n\nAs such if you can help me recruit such a sparring partner, probably through a local emotional support group, please let me know. ¬† I‚Äôm trying to create a list of people/groups I can ask, so If you have any recommendations, please contact me.¬† Official therapy channels can‚Äôt help me here, so this is my only way to get *any*.\n\n\n\nJust to be clear, I am a 6'3\" bearded male, and in therapy I am known to yell and scream, so if you're not prepared to cope and don't know someone else that is, *please* don't waste either of our time bickering over ground rules, because I just set some.¬† In therapy, I'm gonna focus squarely following where my emotion/intuition leads, and if you're too squeamish, backing off when you should be pushing me to dig in and follow my energy, then it just won't work.¬†¬†\n\n",

    "selftext": "I just found out last night some traumatic information about my kids.   \nI apologize for this being so long but I felt like the details mattered‚Ä¶\n\nThe short version is my oldest daughter, now 18, allegedly molested her younger half-brother, now 17, and half-sister, now 15, back in 2017 for probably a couple years.  My oldest has a different father than my other two.  I am so uneasily shaken up even typing that.   My youngest daughter told me this last night on a drive home together.  \n\nI‚Äôm not doubting what I was told; but I haven‚Äôt had a conversation with either of the other two to verify.  \n\nThis conversation happened bc my son has been acting insanely weird since my oldest got home this week.  She is a Marine stationed out in CA and surprised us all by showing up for Christmas.  It was the absolute best surprise ever.  \n\nI asked my youngest what was going on with him‚Ä¶he‚Äôs been uncharacteristically rude, withdrawn, and won‚Äôt eat (wildly unusual for a growing young man).  I tried talking to him and he refuses to talk- which is also super off bc him and I have a very close relationship and can talk about anything.   I thought about it and ask my youngest if it has anything to do with their sister being home bc he does him to have a shift in demeanor when she visits (which is not often obviously).   But nothing like this before.  \n\nShe got real quiet‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.\n\nI gently encouraged her to open up and it was safe to talk to me.   I consider myself incredibly lucky that I [now] have a strong enough relationship with my kids that they are comfortable talking to me about hard things‚Ä¶it wasn‚Äôt like this in the past, I was, unfortunately, an alcoholic and a pill popper (especially around the time she said this happened (I‚Äôll be four years sober in March so there‚Äôs been a lot of growth for everyone over the years)).  \n\nShe told me what happened when they were younger through many, many tears‚Ä¶and my heart just shattered.   I honestly didn‚Äôt think my heart any more breaking left in it bc I‚Äôm dealing with some traumatic infidelity on my my husband‚Äôs part who decided to basically ghost and leave this last week‚Ä¶but apparently my heart had some room left to shatter even more.   \n\nI asked her a couple questions for clarification, told her I will do everything I can to help her, work through this so it doesn‚Äôt create more trauma issues down the road., and asked permission to change to subject (for her sake) and she agreed.  \n\nThe unfortunate part is both my daughters dealt with similar issues when they were younger by outsiders. My oldest‚Äôs ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù (boy) did this to her and I had absolutely no idea for years- they were just too young in my head to ever worry about this and I trusted the parents.   She also went through a traumatic situation in the Marine Corps on similar grounds. \n\nMy youngest, also experienced this from not only an old boy friend‚Äôs (mine) son (they were the same age (I had no idea on this either until years later)) but also from another boy in school in elementary school (I just found this out last night too).  The moment I discovered the traumas from their elementary days (they came to me at the same time years later) I immediately got them help‚Ä¶they both ended up developing self-harm coping mechanisms and became suicidal (I have a similar background from my own life long trauma but they never knew this), despite all our efforts.  \n\nThey both were hospitalized at the same time in 2020.  My oldest was hospitalized twice back to back‚Ä¶they released her and about a week later she had to go back‚Ä¶then she went into an outpatient program for a while.  It was one of the hardest times in our lives. She actually self-admitted herself recently due to current conditions and I presume buried issues from the past too.  \n\nMy son recently got into a lot of trouble with his father for his attitude and behavior- something I‚Äôve never seen before.  He was being extremely disrespectful and mouthing off to his dad- this is absolutely out of character for him. My son is a pretty chill, quiet kid.   Their dad is a good guy, he‚Äôs a little hard on them but I‚Äôd consider him a good father over all- nothing so bad deserving my son‚Äôs treatment.  I sat him down and he finally disclosed that his dad (we are divorced 10 years) was making him feel uncomfortable when he tried to hug him or just give him a general pat of genuine fatherly love on the arm or whatever.  At the time of hearing this, about a month ago, I found this a bit off and thought that his dad wanting to show affection was normal‚Ä¶but wasn‚Äôt going to devalue my son‚Äôs feelings. He said he told his dad to stop, but he didn‚Äôt. And again, this was just normal father to son hugs, affection, etc absolutely nothing out of the ordinary.  \n\nSo, I gently explained this to his dad, they had a talk and things got better‚Ä¶but it hit me last night with the new information exactly why he was acting out and my heart crumbled even more.    \n\nCoincidentally (I guess?), my oldest sent me a video via instagram a couple weeks ago of an adult daughter telling her mother of sexual abuse from her step-father when she was little.  She also sent the comment, ‚Äúdid you know?‚Äù  I told her I had no idea what any of that meant and she never answered me‚Ä¶I didn‚Äôt pursue that conversation but have kept at the front of my mind on how to bring it back up.  I asked her sister last night within the same conversation if she knew anything about her video or comment and she didn‚Äôt.  I honestly cannot think of what that can mean.  \n\nSo, I need to have that conversation with her‚Ä¶but I‚Äôm not sure if I should do this while she‚Äôs here.  This is all an absolute priority for me to sort out for my kids, but I don‚Äôt want stir this up with Christmas here or with everyone under the same roof. I think (?) this needs to be addressed separately and very soon.   \n\nMy other issue is I do need to tell their dad but my daughter requested to wait until my oldest goes back to CA.   So, I have to just sit on this alone for another week or so‚Ä¶and I don‚Äôt even know how to approach this to him.  \n\nI don‚Äôt know what to do in any of this‚Ä¶my family‚Äôs been through a lot‚Ä¶a lot more added on to the above‚Ä¶I know for sure both my youngest need to get into therapy ASAP.   \n\nI have  already taken fault/blame for anything and everything my kids have been through as a result of my addiction.  I was never a bad mother in a sense that I abused them, they honestly didn‚Äôt see a lot of my struggles bc honestly I wasn‚Äôt around a lot‚Ä¶they were always well taken care of (great home, house full of food, anything they wanted and needed was provided)‚Ä¶I was just absent mostly mentally and emotionally.  Most of my binges and etc were done when they were with their father or late at night when they were sleeping.  But, the mental and emotional disconnection absolutely played a part in their own struggles and I‚Äôve owned up to that.  Now, I see they went through so much more than my worst nightmares and I feel an immense more amount of shame and guilt.  \n\nMy son doesn‚Äôt know I know any of this and I have no idea how to gently approach this with him.  I can see he‚Äôs hurting so bad with his sister here though.   \n\nI don‚Äôt know how to be a supportive to them all, but I most certainly want to be.   \n\nI now have some very uncomfortable feelings about my oldest daughter that I‚Äôm trying to sort out bc I know deep down, she didn‚Äôt know what she was doing and my youngest wonders if her sister even remembers any of it‚Ä¶as do I.   I‚Äôll sort this out with my own therapist I use for my infidelity trauma.  I‚Äôm more concerned about my kids right now. \n\nAside from therapy, how can I help and support them all in this???  Any insight, advice, personal experience would be so, so appreciated   Thank you for taking the time to listen.   ",

    "selftext": "\nFrom December 2022 until about June of this year, I had back to back crises. I was experiencing 7/10 constant chest pain for months, with no relief, multiple ER visits, and no support from any doctors for months until they discovered it was gallstones. But I was left in agony for five months, being told it was all in my head, having to lose my job, only to be told later it actually wasn‚Äôt all in my head. I had even convinced myself I was crazy and that I must be experiencing some kind of psychosis to be in so much pain for no reason. And soon after that, I developed a shoulder issue that took over a year of daily physical therapy to recover from, and involved daily, sometimes terrible pain. I‚Äôm much better now and experience much, much less pain, but I feel like a ghost in my own body now. I felt gaslit by doctors into believing I wasn‚Äôt even a sane person, only for them to turn around and go like ‚Äúwait, never mind.‚Äù And I never even got an apology! I don‚Äôt trust my own body anymore, I don‚Äôt trust medical professionals anymore. I don‚Äôt feel like I can relate to people my own age anymore. The joy I had in/for life was completely stripped from me and now I just feel this emptiness. I saw a therapist for about a year and tried to talk about this, but I always felt they never fully understood what I was saying. I just don‚Äôt know how to heal from this, emotionally. I don‚Äôt know how to feel hopeful for the future or invested in life anymore. I‚Äôm just looking for advice from people who have gone through something similar and how they came to enjoy life again or feel like themselves again. I feel like a completely different person now, and not in a good way. I know I‚Äôll probably have to go back to therapy, but I feel like I‚Äôve already lost so much time and I‚Äôm only losing more. If anyone has any ideas/tools that could help, I‚Äôd really appreciate them. \n",

I made sure he learned to talk and stand up, that he‚Äôd be safe from both our Mom‚Äôs. \nWhich was hard and sucked; to put it bluntly he is a spoiled little shit.

A bunch of shit that shouldn't have happened, happened. The circumstances and ethics of this whole situationship were murky, but long story short, he r-ped me.

I still like him. Like, a lot. It's been about 2 1/2 months since this happened and I've been, um, obsessively mulling over everything in my head for the last week to an extent that I haven't since the few days right after it happened. Except instead of having flashbacks, I've been um... wondering what it would have been like if things had been consensual (to use the most vague, unsexy terms ever). I've been thinking about dropping charges, I'm constantly drafting texts to send to him that I know I shouldn't send (like in the last 2 hours I've probably drafted and deleted at least 10 LONGGGG texts, not exaggerating).

    "selftext": "Hi everyone, I‚Äôm 23 years old, and I feel like I‚Äôm only now realizing how disconnected I‚Äôve been for as long as I can remember. I don‚Äôt know how else to put it, but I‚Äôve been living in a fog‚Äîlike life was muted, numb, and not real. I thought that‚Äôs just how life was until recently, when I started experiencing moments of what I can only call ‚Äúclarity.‚Äù\n\nThese moments are brief, but they feel overwhelmingly real. It‚Äôs like I can suddenly see and feel the world as it‚Äôs supposed to be‚Äîbrighter, clearer, and fuller. I can feel lights and sensations in a way I‚Äôve never noticed before, and I feel like I‚Äôm grounded in my body. But these moments don‚Äôt last long. When they fade, it‚Äôs like I go right back into that familiar state of numbness and dissociation, where nothing feels real again.\n\nSometimes, when I‚Äôm sleeping or close to falling asleep, I‚Äôll suddenly ‚Äúsnap back‚Äù into my body in a jarring way that freaks me out. It‚Äôs unpredictable, and I don‚Äôt understand it.\n\nHere‚Äôs some context about my life, because I think it‚Äôs all connected:\n\nI endured physical and emotional abuse and neglect since infancy, mainly from my mum. People told me stories about how I was neglected as a baby, but growing up, everyone pretended it wasn‚Äôt happening.\n\nI experienced sexual assault at ages 8, 19, and 21.\n\nI have an autistic sister who has suffered the same physical and emotional abuse and neglect. I watched this happen for years until I grew strong enough to defend both her and myself. Even now, I‚Äôve caught my mum abusing her when I‚Äôm not around. The abuse seems to only stop when I‚Äôm present.\n\nMy dad never protected us. He ignores what happens, gaslights me, and pretends everything is fine.\n\n\nOne specific event sticks with me. I found a mark on my sister after my mum hit her. My dad tried to gaslight me, and when I turned to my mum, she was grinning. I blacked out completely‚Äîeverything went black‚Äîand when I came to, I was in the living room with my sister. I later realized I had hit my mum during the blackout. It terrifies me because I had no memory of what I did.\n\nRight now, I still live in the same house with the same people. I have no way out because my sister depends on me. Therapy isn‚Äôt accessible where I live (it‚Äôs a 3rd-world country), and I can‚Äôt afford it anyway. EMDR isn‚Äôt available here either, so I‚Äôve been trying to do small things on my own. My plan is to save up, move to Canada, and study something I can work with quickly so I can get stable and start truly healing.\n\nAfter researching, everything I‚Äôm experiencing seems to point toward C-PTSD (Complex PTSD) combined with chronic dissociation/derealization. I feel like I‚Äôve been dissociated for my whole life because of the ongoing trauma, and these glimpses of clarity are what life could actually be. But I‚Äôm not sure if this is right.\n\nDoes this sound like C-PTSD and chronic dissociation to anyone? Have I been disconnected my entire life, or is it possible I‚Äôve forgotten what ‚Äúreal‚Äù life feels like?\n\nIf anyone has gone through something similar, please share your experiences. How did you make sense of this? What helped you feel more connected and grounded? If you know tools, resources, or even directions to explore, I‚Äôd really appreciate it. I feel like I‚Äôm only starting to see the possibility of what life can be, but I don‚Äôt know how to hold onto it.\n\nThank you for reading this.

    "selftext": "Edit: Glad I posted. thanks to me posting this I got closure and I was contacted and I'll leave this up for advice on trauma and so people can see the damages of boxing possibilities.  Traumas are very hard to go through.  but a lot of my issues and thinking got put to rest for this and now have time to process it and thanks to everyone that has given advice messaging.  Thank you.  I'll try and keep up to date if anyone else responds so I'll try and remember to check this out for any comments or messages sent to me.  I believe this is good for people to see what happened to me.  Random events just be ready as you can to come and expect something bad the best you can for my story as an example below. \n\nBurner account.  My last account was ‚Äúto lefitst‚Äù apparently, for Reddit and I need a break off it.  Alright well I‚Äôm a boxer since like I can remember memories.  Dad was a pro boxer and trained me young.  It‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt fun.   But when hit puberty I loved it.  \n  I‚Äôve had 74 matches.  Soon to be 76, 76, and HOPEFULLY 77 if I can win upcoming tournament üòâ (pray for me this will be my big break and only god can get me there).  Anyways our club travelled to BC for 4 of us to go against another clubs other 4 guys.  Like I rarely lose ever.  Never been knocked out before all the way to my 20 years old  after all those years.  I was told my matchup was just against their only 165 guy.  Easy win right? I was chillin with the boys just bored and ready to do my match.  I had no idea what was coming.  This guy who I hate and still do and you‚Äôll know why.  He came at me at speeds I‚Äôve never seen IN MY LIFE.  I got to go do the Roy jones tournament in Las Vegas and came 4th.  I got to see Canelo live.  Bievol.  Wilder.  Prime GGG.  Too many to list.  Ok, I‚Äôm pretty sure I fought the best boxer in the world.  This guy had no business in the ring with me.  He came in some hybrid peekaboo style and I‚Äôm tall and I can usually keep guys on the outside all day.  Especially shorter I think he was 5‚Äô9 or 5‚Äô7 or something.  Anyways to me short.  Though I heard he put on 16 pounds in 2 hours after weigh in pre match and they said he did a cut as that‚Äôs the rule if you do a cut in that level.  I‚Äôm roughly (6‚Äô3).  Normally 164-168 pounds walking weight.  He was for sure if hydrated 180-190.   Ok hear me out‚Ä¶..  I know elite.  I‚Äôve watched it close to ringside with world champions.  About 17 rows back of ringside with Canelo in Texas my dad took me to!  It was so amazing to see a legend up that close.   So this guy in my routine match came to kill.  I don‚Äôt care about what any of his coaches said after or anything to my coach.  He‚Äôs apparently a drifter and goes around to any gym and learns new stuff apparently and he‚Äôs a very weird guy like super hardcore and I think he was just training to kill guys.  It was so disrespectful he was like 9 years older then me!!!  I was 20 I think?  Ya about 6-7 years ago.  Alright so I got out of the first round.  But I got dropped 2 times and I don‚Äôt have any memory of that.  I remember sitting on the chair.  Blood pouring everywhere.  Coaches panicking.  I looked over at him.  His coaches weren‚Äôt even talking to this psychopath.  He was staring at me.  He wanted me dead.  I told coach IM DONE.  He was yelling at me to jab and left hook and rotate left and angle away (wouldn‚Äôt have worked this guy knew I swear what I was even thinking about doing.)  Before it went black.  Saying also to stay outside and try to get through 4 more rounds and take the loss.  So ya I listened to coach because all the guys I grew up with look up to me as the great boxer of our city.  You know to go pro after the next olympics attempt and to be the next gold champion Canadian as a goal which was coming up in a few years at that time if I put 5 years of hard work in.  My division needed a me.  This is the most fear I‚Äôve ever had in my life.  I felt like I don‚Äôt know how to even say it.  That if I go back out there that I‚Äôll die.  I get messed up thinking about it.  It was truly traumatic.  The ref comes over and points at my jaw and says doctor.  Doctor comes and says he thinks it‚Äôs not broken but it looks like I have some loose molars? or whatever the back tooth‚Äôs are called.  I never had them taken out younger.  Made it hard fitting a mouth guard without stabbing my gums.  Anyways the pressure of my friends and coach I went back out.  Still he didn‚Äôt have the coach talking.  He just stared at me and my legs noodled out.  I felt I had a stone chin.  I never thought I could even be knocked out?  Or even stunned?  Until that day.  I knew 4 rounds‚Ä¶. Is not happening.  So that was the most brave thing I ever did.  I should have got a trophy.  Round starts and boom he takes a massive leap to close the gap and kind of like manny paq peekaboo or mike Tyson style dodging.  He was perfect.  He was letting me punch and he was not hittable.  He then loosed up and backed up and did a head nod to me.  Was that respect?  I think he appreciated my skill?  Speed?  Something?  OR he was ready to finish me off and was paying his last respects?  Is what I suspect now.  My coach is saying if I can‚Äôt touch him he‚Äôs calling it off.  Well I didn‚Äôt hit him.  He bobbed left and right so far down but close like a 15 foot gap in a half a second and my lights out.  Last memory is him.  Boom boom tats it?  I woke up 3 weeks later in the hospital.  Freaked out when I woke up ripped out my stuff in arm had one eye blind and felt my face and started ripping off bandages screaming IM BLIND.  I was blinded but not totally but the cause of the darkness in that eye was because they did orbital bone reconstruction surgery and reattached my eye so my right eye is constant fuzzy looking and ya my jaw broke and I lost 7 teeth,  cost my family 9 thousand dollars in dental fees and my jaw was wired shut and I didn‚Äôt even notice cause of the panic.  Doctors rush in and give me some morphine or something and I chill out and they ask ‚Äúwhere were you the last time you remember‚Äù and stuff like that.  Alright the last thing I remember is him.  I was put in a medical induced coma after my brain kept swelling after my new teeth job and wiring shut I have no memory of and they said I was partially awake but was hallucinating.  Brain swollen, bro‚Äôs and brogirls,  it was horrific.  I have actual anxiety still but I had to take meds.  Like anti depressants and I never had mental health issues before.  Think they gave me Valium or something for panic attacks.  The pain was so bad I stayed in the hospital for 3 months I almost died.  The doctor said I am extremely lucky.  Um no.  Not lucky.  But this man should never be allowed to box.  I got to watch the video months later.  My friends thank god didn‚Äôt judge me as even our heavyweight in the 40 plus division area I think said he would have had the same fate as me and he‚Äôs a power puncher.  So I got healthy again and was so depressed and lost my shape and got fat.  So naturally I started boxing workouts.  That led to me boxing again.  And that helped much.  I don‚Äôt care what anybody says.  I fought the number one boxer in the planet and lived.  I‚Äôd rather fight any guy you list then that psycho again.  Boxers if he‚Äôs still active beware for a Devin Grettum.  Or Devon Grettum.  Or Devan?  Anyways that was the name.   They said the coaches let him do his own coaching.  He just came to clubs to learn something new all the time?  Weird person.   To me you should stick to one or 2 coaches but now I think I may start doing roaming around like him,  he was a perfect boxer and his physical ability wasn‚Äôt fair.  That gym should be ashamed of themselves.  Some crazy guy goes around to study and learn and have fights they told my coach and he roams around and I swear he‚Äôs killed people.  Like, I‚Äôm a damn Olympic possibility boxer at that time.  Successful pro career boxer.  Still will be.  But now I will never get bored again before a match.  I scale food now and measure water intake and all that now.  He taught me something I guess.  Know who the hell I am boxing beforehand and I also stopped being so arrogant.  And it was relief to not have to impress my friends all the time after.  I‚Äôm a better boxer from it.    But I almost died.  They shouldn‚Äôt allow people to do what he does.  Or did.  I don‚Äôt know maybe he‚Äôs dead I can‚Äôt find info on him anywhere.   Likely cause name is wrong.  I don‚Äôt know.  I hope I dont get some type of future health issues from it.  Worst 2 years of my life.  I guess that‚Äôs better than being dead?  I don‚Äôt know.  My dad used to beat me up until I was good enough (with gloves on training me).  He said he was going to kill my coach when he came from Ontario to visit me when he heard from my step mom what happened.  He would to.  My dad I think would have no shame spending life in jail.  All of my sisters and brother convinced him not to.  Whose fault is it?  Is it the coach and club I had at the times fault?  Was this guy purposely trying to take my life?  He got banned from ever roaming around that town clubs the boxing coaches there said.  Wether that‚Äôs wrong or right I don‚Äôt know.  Like I said he‚Äôs apparently weird.  All we know is the 2 months he was there training at their club he didn‚Äôt talk to anyone and they said he did 4 workouts a day equaling 9 hours of training a day. Brought a food scale everywhere and I guess ate the grossest foods all day long but I presume healthy food.  He was for sure trying to be like a mechanical robot that kills.   He passed the PED test forced after on him.  Not like that means he wasn‚Äôt on it.  Maybe he‚Äôs in some country doing the same now.  I don‚Äôt know what I would do seeing him I hate Devan or whatever you spell his name is.  I doubt anyone in this sub can compare their story to this.  Like I get it I see horror things said.  But this was self induced?  I did it willingly when I went back out for the half minute or so into the 2nd round.  If anyone boxes and you see that name DO NOT BOX HIM.  Please üôè.  I‚Äôm saving your life if you cancel and get stuck in that hell.  The pain was traumatic itself for months and months.   But something was wrong with that guy.  I‚Äôd bet him to win against any 165-175 in the world.  I fought the best fighter in the world.  That‚Äôs my experience of severe trauma.  I hope nobody has to face what I did.  The pain.  The torment.  The ego dying.  I used to take drugs once in a while and couldn‚Äôt smoke weed even anymore without him smoking and nodding to me.  I can‚Äôt explain it.  He had to be on PED and have some other things wrong.  Never again.  I will only box guys with a long history of recorded tape I can watch like I have personally for myself,  and that actually has me on a 27-2 streak since.  If I make the next Olympics wish me luck!!!  Take care everyone.  That‚Äôs something I can‚Äôt explain.  ",

    "selftext": "Hello all! I've posted in here before but it's been a bit. I want to start by saying this is by no means an attempt at self-promotion. I'm a writer and documentarian, and my work (outside of my 9-5) revolves around spotlighting the nuances of trauma and generating awareness. I'm a huge advocate for accessibility, which is why I try to make free resources (like the film I'm about to share) for people like me! \n\nWhen I was nineteen, childhood trauma came to the forefront when a 'memory of a memory' resurfaced. I could remember that yes, I had been sexually assaulted, but other than a handful of sensory fragments, there was no storyline. It was extremely jarring--*How can you be haunted by something you can't even remember?* But I soon realized that this phenomenon wasn't only common amongst survivors of childhood trauma (more specifically, CSA), but also completely inline with the nature of trauma and memory. \n\nI've spent the last four years directing a documentary on the ordeal hoping to highlight this experience, the fallout of recovered memories and the delayed onset of PTSD. While I've screened the film a few times now, today I made it public for the first time, so I wanted to share it with you all in the hopes it may make some people out there feel seen. While this is just a draft of the first half, I anticipate wrapping it up in 2025! \n\nYou can find more about the project and some helpful resources at projectpaperbirds.com! I have been in EMDR for a year and a half now and have made HUGE strides. This is the most stable and happy I've been in my whole life, so healing is possible even in the absence of answers!!! :)\n\nTW for documentary: CSA, PTSD & Disassociation.\n\n[https://youtu.be/R-eed760oZA?si=pLkyjdm2GjOrLZCf](https://youtu.be/R-eed760oZA?si=pLkyjdm2GjOrLZCf)",

    "title": "I tried to OD but survived, now I am living my best life.",
    "selftext": "Hi, I‚Äôm (F17) and I know this is going to be very personal, but I feel like I need to share this part of my life to finally get it off my chest. I turned 17 in June, but in April of this year (when i was 16), I was at one of the lowest points of my life, and I made a choice that almost cost me everything. I tried to overdose.\n\nI was in so much pain, emotionally and mentally, and I didn‚Äôt know how to cope with it anymore. My dad, who has type 1 diabetes, takes a lot of medications every day. One night, I decided to take over 30+ pills from his medication stash. I mixed his prescribed pills with other random pills I had around‚Äînothing made sense to me at that moment. I just wanted to escape the overwhelming feelings I was dealing with.\n\nI went to bed that night, hoping I wouldn‚Äôt wake up. The weight of my eating disorder, the heartbreak from a breakup with someone I had loved dearly, and the ongoing battle with self-harm made me feel like there was no other way out. It felt like I couldn‚Äôt breathe under the pressure of everything. I remember feeling like there was no hope left, no reason to keep fighting.\n\nBut to my shock, my body didn‚Äôt react the way I expected. That night, I slept normally, without the chaos I thought would come. The next day, I woke up and still didn‚Äôt feel any major physical symptoms. I dragged myself through the day, feeling nothing but nausea. My eating disorder made everything worse‚Äîbecause I was only eating once a day, my body wasn‚Äôt getting what it needed, and the nausea became so unbearable. I honestly don‚Äôt know how I survived it. The fact that I didn‚Äôt feel worse, or worse yet, that I didn‚Äôt end up losing my life, still doesn‚Äôt make sense to me.\n\nI went to school that day, barely able to concentrate because of how sick I felt. I couldn‚Äôt talk to anyone about it. At the time, it felt like no one understood the pain I was carrying. I was so caught up in my own spiral of self-doubt and grief. The nausea from not eating, mixed with everything else, felt like it was swallowing me whole. I still can‚Äôt explain how I made it through the day, and yet somehow, I did\n\nIn July, I had the chance to visit my family for the first time in almost 12 years. That visit meant so much to me, and looking back, it feels like a turning point in my life. It‚Äôs still hard to believe how close I came to never meeting anyone in my family or feeling their love if my overdose had actually worked. The thought of missing out on that experience, of never getting to feel the warmth and support from my family, really hits me hard now.\n\nMy parents and I live in a foreign country, and we don‚Äôt have any family here. For so many years, it‚Äôs just been the three of us, and I‚Äôve missed the connection with my extended family. That trip was the first time in over a decade that I was able to be surrounded by them, and it felt like a dream. Everyone welcomed me with open arms. It was the first time I truly felt the love that I had been missing for so long. They treated me like a princess‚Äîeveryone I spoke to praised me and adored me. For once, I wasn‚Äôt the outsider or the person left behind.\n\nThe attention, the love, the affection‚ÄîI had never experienced anything like it. It felt so overwhelming in the best possible way. I finally felt like I mattered, like I was seen for who I was. It was as if I was ‚Äúamazing,‚Äù just being myself. It was a powerful moment of validation that I never knew I needed, and it made me realize how much I had been missing out on by isolating myself for so long. That visit gave me a sense of belonging I had never truly felt before, and I think it was the first time in a long while that I felt loved in such a pure, unreserved way.\n\nLooking back, I can‚Äôt believe that all of this was almost taken from me. The love and connection I experienced with my family during that time remind me how precious life is, and how important it is to hold on‚Äîeven when things feel impossible. That trip was a reminder that there‚Äôs so much more to live for, and I‚Äôm so grateful to have had the chance to experience it.\n\nIt‚Äôs hard to grasp how something so small, like a bad decision in a moment of pain, almost ended my life. But I survived. I‚Äôve been clean for about 1-2 months now, and after the family trip, I gained weight, which was a big step for me.\n\nI can't fully explain how much happier I am now. There are still moments when I feel sad, but happiness has become the dominant feeling in my life. For the first time, I can honestly say I‚Äôm happy to be alive. I feel grateful, truly. I‚Äôm young, and I have so much to look forward to and experience in life. I‚Äôm just thankful for the second chance I‚Äôve been given.\n\nJust know that even if it feels like your life is crashing, things *will* get better. I‚Äôve been struggling with self-harm since I was 9, and it took almost a decade to get through it. But I did, and if I can, so can you. It may feel like things are taking an eternity to improve, but change is possible. You‚Äôre not alone in this. I promise, things will get better, even when it feels like there‚Äôs no way out. Keep pushing forward‚Äîyou‚Äôre stronger than you think.\n\nAnyways, thank you so much for taking the time to read this. I just want to say that if I can recover, so can you. It‚Äôs not an easy journey, but it‚Äôs possible, and you are so much stronger than you realize. Please, if you‚Äôre struggling, seek out professional help or talk to someone you trust. You don‚Äôt have to face it alone. There‚Äôs support out there, and reaching out is the first step toward healing. I believe in you. You are worth the fight, and you deserve to find peace and happiness.",

    "title": "Seeking Advice on Family Dynamics and Mental Health",
    "selftext": "Hello everyone, I would like to share my story and ask for your opinions.\n\nI am a 34-year-old man and was raised by my mother. My father is not a part of my life, so we have no contact.\n\nWhen I was 6 years old, my mother separated from my father, and we moved to my grandmother's house, which was full of family members. I slept in a room that was outside the main house, along with my cousin, who was about 17 years old at the time.\n\nUnfortunately, during that time, I went through two traumatic experiences. One of them was with this cousin, who sexually abused me when I was 6 years old, and the other was with a half-brother.\n\nI have already scheduled an appointment with a psychologist to try to understand what is going on in my mind. Lately, I haven't been able to sleep well because of all the thoughts running through my head.\n\nWhen I was about 23 years old, my mother found photos of guys on my phone. At that time, I told her about my feelings and what had happened to me as a child, so she knows what my cousin did to me.\n\nToday, I live in Lisbon, I own my own house here, and I always talk to my mother on the phone. She knows about my feelings and always encourages me to have a girlfriend, but that's not the issue.\n\nSometimes, she mentions this cousin. Often, I think it would be natural, as she only says things like: \"I was at so-and-so's house when you called me,\" \"so-and-so did something I liked and I'm going to do it too,\" \"I bought the refrigerator from so-and-so,\" with so-and-so being this same cousin.\n\nToday, my feelings are all confused. I was talking to my younger brother (he lives here in my house), and he mentioned that my mother was trying to get my cousin and his wife to visit my house in Lisbon (they lived here for a year, but thankfully no longer). According to my brother, my mother wanted me to make peace with this cousin.\n\nMy mother is the person I love most in this world, especially because she is a warrior who raised me alone. However, these actions of hers make me feel very bad. I was planning to visit Brazil in March, but now I'm almost giving up.\n\nAm I overreacting by being so upset and wanting to cancel the trip to Brazil to focus on my mental health? I don't know if I can face my mother in person and not talk about everything as soon as I get there, which would make the atmosphere very tense.\n\nThank you for reading my story.",

I‚Äôve been navigating the aftermath of emotional and physical abuse, chronic pain, and a complicated past. It‚Äôs been a journey, and as I move forward, I‚Äôm focusing on building healthier coping strategies to deal with everything I‚Äôve been through.\n\nOne thing that‚Äôs really been helping me lately is ChatGPT. I use it to vent but also to gain insight outside of my own sometimes damaged or confused mind. It‚Äôs been helpful for creating moments of peace during overwhelming days. It‚Äôs not always easy, but I feel like I‚Äôm making progress, even if it‚Äôs small.\n\nAnother thing that‚Äôs helped is finding new ways to shift my perspective when the pain feels too much. Instead of focusing solely on the weight of what‚Äôs happened, I try to redirect my energy into things that are constructive, like journaling or creative outlets. I‚Äôve found that using my story to help others has provided a small glimmer of light in a gloomy existence.\n\nI‚Äôd love to hear what others in this community have found helpful in their healing journey. I‚Äôm still figuring it all out, but I‚Äôm grateful for any insights or suggestions.\n\nThanks for reading, and I look forward to connecting with everyone here!",

She lives with the surviving parent and feels trapped in that scenario for a variety of reasons. She does not have a strong friend network or romantic partner to help support her.\n\nFrom what I have observed, my friend is stuck in a victim mentality at this point in time. She does not feel like she has any power over her life. She has not been able to return to work, form any new relationships with people or function in her daily life since this event. She constantly blames events and people and feels nothing is within her control and that she is not accountable for anything that happens. \n\nI want to support her and am struggling with the constant stream of negativity. She rejects any suggestion that she can do anything at all to change her surroundings, and our conversations are dominated by complaining and blaming.

I no longer know what to say or do, and feel that the friendship is becoming draining, causing me to want to pull away when she needs support most.\n\nIf anyone has experience in this type of scenario I would really love some advice.

But early on, she frequently brought up her ex, which should have been a red flag. Eventually, we met in person, and it was a good experience at first. But not long after, she ended things because she didn‚Äôt like my teeth. Foolishly, I gave her a second chance when she reached out a few days later.\n\nAs time passed, more complications arose. Together, we discovered that my best friend of 20 years had a troubling past. She gave me an ultimatum: choose her or him. While her concerns were valid, I needed time to process the situation. Ultimately, I chose her.\n\nAfter that, things deteriorated. She stopped coming to my place and wouldn‚Äôt let me visit hers, saying she was embarrassed by me. If I didn‚Äôt send her a good morning text, she‚Äôd be upset for the entire day. If I went out, even briefly, and didn‚Äôt inform her, she‚Äôd get angry. She became increasingly controlling, demanding to know where I was at all times.\n\nOne day, she shouted at me, insisting I fix my teeth because she found them ‚Äúnoticeable.‚Äù It brought me to tears. I met her family, but the situation didn‚Äôt improve. She continued to bring up her ex, started fights with my friends, and pressured me to cut ties with them one by one.\n\nWhen her birthday approached, I suggested a venue, but she refused because it was tied to memories with her ex. She wouldn‚Äôt help me find another option, claiming everywhere else had similar memories. Communication with her was impossible. If she wanted something, I was supposed to just know. If I asked, she‚Äôd say no but criticize me behind my back for not understanding her needs. She even called me a narcissist because I mentioned that helping others made me happy‚ÄîI volunteer a lot.\n\nEven small things became exhausting. When we played games, she‚Äôd constantly restart them, and if I grew tired of doing so after hours of effort, I was in the wrong again.\n\nWe finally broke up shortly after I spent a significant amount of money taking her out. She began openly flirting with other guys in our social circles, claiming it was fine for her to do so. That was the final straw. We stopped talking altogether for various reasons.\n\nNow, a year later, I‚Äôm still shattered. I‚Äôm terrified to love again. The hatred I feel for her frightens me‚Äîit‚Äôs overwhelming and consuming.

It happened at least ten times. \nTowards the end of the relationship, I felt like I was only in it because I felt used and obligated to him because he took my virg!nity (and vice Versa). I tried to break up with him over call because he lived 3ish hours away. He wouldn‚Äôt answer, so I had to resort to text. Long story short, he was heartbroken, I felt lost and confused because I thought that nobody would want me, and Z and I were no longer together. \nI genuinely still don‚Äôt know if that is okay because we were in a relationship or not. All I know is that I‚Äôm still terrified of intimacy, but for completely different reasons now.

Hopefully I'll be leaving this shit state soon\n\nFor those who don't know autistic meltdowns are when an autistic person gets overstimulated and they quite literally lose control of themselves for me it was usually emotional overstimulation but it can also be sensory overstimulation. When we do get overstimulated some of us black out and start screaming, growling, uncontrollable crying or hitting anything and anyone nearby.\n\nThanks for letting me vent it still bothers me to this day",

    "title": "Can we heal from trauma or only learn how to deal with them?",
    "selftext": "This is a question that I have been exploring for many years. I have a feeling it has a lot to do with the lack of education and the current state of the Western world in terms of how we deal with trauma and emotions on a state level. For example, it is a super underrated topic in almost all structures of Western society.\n\nI believe we can actually heal and from what I have experienced it has a lot do to with feeling authentically unprocessed emotions from the past and reframing our beliefs. They kind of go hand in hand...\n\nI am also asking this question from a bigger picture... meaning, it seems like some people have a bigger drive than others to explore themselves, to look at things that are hiding in the darkness, to heal, and for others despite their huge struggles, they don't want to look at these things even though these things are unavoidable in a way.\n\nSo, do you think we are trapped in our predispositions in that way, or do you think this is because of the lack of education, the current structures of society, and the subsequent belief systems?  \n  \nps.

    "title": "Finally Had an Epiphany‚ÄîBreaking 3-Year Cycle of  Negativity",
    "selftext": "For the past three years, I lived in a cycle of negativity that left me feeling hopeless and directionless. It‚Äôs hard to fully describe what that felt like‚Äîlike I was surviving, but not living. It all started with a traumatic event that shook my worldview at the deepest levels. My sense of security, my understanding of myself, and the way I processed emotions‚Äîit all felt shattered.\n\nAt the time, I didn‚Äôt realize what was happening because I didn‚Äôt have the tools to understand it. But looking back, I see now that the trauma amplified a coping mechanism I‚Äôd developed earlier in life: avoidance. Whenever I felt pain, discomfort, or strong emotions, I‚Äôd distract myself‚Äîworking, staying busy, or shutting down entirely. The feelings would eventually fade, or so I thought. But the reality is, I never processed them.\n\nThis pattern stayed with me for years. Whenever something went wrong, I‚Äôd push forward on autopilot without addressing the emotional weight of it. I thought I was resilient, but all I was doing was burying the pain deeper. Over time, I lost my internal fire, my motivation, and my sense of self. It felt like I was running on empty, and no matter how hard I tried to ‚Äúpush through,‚Äù I was stuck.\n\nThe Epiphany That Changed Everything\n\nWhat finally broke the cycle wasn‚Äôt planned‚Äîit felt like a fluke. During an argument, I blurted out a deeply internalized belief about myself, one that I hadn‚Äôt even consciously acknowledged before. Hearing it out loud startled me. For the first time, I realized just how off that thought was.\n\nThat moment set off a chain reaction. I started questioning my thought patterns and stumbled upon the concept of dichotomous thinking‚Äîthe tendency to see things in black-and-white terms. Reading about it was like looking into a mirror. I realized I had spent my life applying this rigid way of thinking to everything, including how I viewed myself and my relationships.\n\nHere‚Äôs the scary part: dichotomous thinking had always worked for me in certain areas of my life‚Äîespecially problem-solving. I had no idea it was sabotaging my emotional well-being. Recognizing that my ‚Äúinfallible‚Äù way of thinking was, in fact, flawed was profoundly unsettling, but also freeing.\n\nAs I dug deeper, I learned about cognitive dissonance and how I‚Äôd been internalizing negative beliefs about myself‚Äîbeliefs I‚Äôd absorbed from external situations and relationships. Understanding that these weren‚Äôt inherent truths but learned patterns allowed me to step back for the first time.\n\nWhat Helped Me Get Through It\n\nHere‚Äôs the hard truth: confronting your emotions is incredibly painful. When I started trying to face my feelings instead of avoiding them, my body would go into full defense mode. My chest would tighten, my thoughts would race, and my nervous system would scream at me to distract myself or shut down.\n\nI realized that this reaction‚Äîthis overwhelming sense of anxiety or tension‚Äîis just my body perceiving a threat. But the key is this: the emotions aren‚Äôt actually a threat to your life, no matter how much your body reacts as if they are.\n\nThe hardest part is catching yourself in the moment. When those feelings rise up, try to pause. Don‚Äôt distract yourself. Don‚Äôt lash out. Just feel the emotions. At first, it feels unbearable, but over time, you realize that emotions are like waves‚Äîthey rise, peak, and eventually fall.\n\nOne thing that helped me was thinking about emotions like food. You have to ‚Äúchew‚Äù on them to digest them properly. You can‚Äôt just shove them away and hope they‚Äôll disappear. If you let yourself fully experience your emotions, you‚Äôll start to process them instead of letting them pile up.\n\nWhy I‚Äôm Sharing This\n\nI know how hard it is to break out of this cycle. If I could go back in time and try to convince myself to change even a month ago, I don‚Äôt think I would‚Äôve listened. It took me three years and a lucky moment of clarity to even start addressing my emotions. That scares me because I know how easily I could have gone my whole life without learning these tools.\n\nI also realized that a lot of these patterns‚Äîavoidance, anger, emotional disconnection‚Äîweren‚Äôt just mine. My parents passed them down to me because they didn‚Äôt have the tools either. They coped with their pain in the only ways they knew how, and I learned to do the same. It‚Äôs a cycle that repeats until someone decides to break it.\n\nIf you‚Äôre in a similar place‚Äîfeeling stuck, overwhelmed, or hopeless‚ÄîI just want to say: you‚Äôre not alone. This process isn‚Äôt easy. It‚Äôs uncomfortable, painful, and often feels impossible. But if this message helps even one person take a small step toward breaking the cycle, it will be worth sharing.\n\nWhere to Start\n\nIf you‚Äôre ready to dig into your emotions, here‚Äôs what worked for me:\n1.\tRecognize the Patterns: Look at how you react to pain or discomfort. Are you avoiding it? Distracting yourself?\n2.\tSit With the Emotions: When you feel anger, sadness, or anxiety rising, don‚Äôt push it away. Let yourself feel it fully.\n3.\tReflect Afterward: Once you‚Äôve calmed down, revisit the emotion and ask: What was this trying to tell me?\n4.\tLearn About Thinking Traps: Research dichotomous thinking or cognitive distortions. These patterns often keep us stuck without realizing it.\n5.\tBe Patient With Yourself: Change takes time. It‚Äôs okay to move slowly, as long as you keep moving.\n\nIf this resonates with you, know that it‚Äôs possible to break the cycle. It‚Äôs hard, and it might take time, but with awareness and persistence, you can change.",

    "selftext": "My mom was a great single mom to me and my older sister up until she met my step dad.. She got with my stepdad and when he came into the picture my mom all of a sudden wasn't my mom anymore and what I mean by that is she started letting me do things she would have never let me do. Like drinking and smoking (I was 12). (There's also alot more stuff but its honestly really bad) Well fast faward to when I turned 15 my step dad was cheating on my mom, I finally had enough  and I told my mom. He kicked me out and I moved in with my bf and his sister.. He was so pissed that I told her and that my mom knew and she was upset and wanting to leave him that he beat my mom so badly. My baby sister came running down (I lived like 5 houses down from them) to my house beating on my door telling me her dad was beating my mom with a hammer and not the flat side the side with the hooks. So I ran down and started beating on the door like I was the police. Finally he stopped hitting her and came to the door.\n\n He answered the door and seen it was me and all I saw was rage radiating from him. I moved away from the door so that way he couldn't  grab me and drag me inside. But the next thing I know he punches me in the face like I was a grown man. I started screaming so that way the neighbors would come running outside and I just kept screaming \" you punched me i can't believe you punched me\" the neighbors called the cops and I left before they got there becuz i wanted my mom to be the one to press charges on him.. My mom never talked to them so they left.. \n\nHe then wouldn't let me see my mom to make sure she was okay or anything. And then a day later he let me see my mom and he swore he didn't touch her. I can still picture the way she looked and this happenend 15 years ago.. When I walked in to her bedroom my heart broke. She had bruises and deep puncture marks all over. Her throat had dark bruises all around it. I instantly started to cry and I almost didn't want to hug her becuz I knew anywhere I hugged her at, it would hurt her.. Soon as she seen me she started to cry too. My one eye and cheek bone was swollen and shut closed and bruised. She showed me clumps of hair that he had ripped out of her head. It was so bad. We made a plan that when he went hunting I would get her out of there. Long story short he came home after I had her car packed and he bagged her to stay. And she did. 15 years later and she is still with him. And now married. I was the only one out of 5 kids (3 kids that are his, 2 boys and a girl, and my mom has me and my sister) That wasn't invited to their wedding.\n\nHe has her so brainwashed now. And he's one of those people who make up everything and is so invested in causing drama. He has made up horrible stories about me just to make other people hate me. Its extremely toxic. My older sister doesn't talk to my mom or any of them at all. And I've stayed away but still want a relationship with my mom. I honestly don't know what to do or how to move about the situation. I really want to see my mom for the holidays but if I do I have to go to their house where he's at. My mom doesn't really go anywhere besides work and home. He doesn't work and hasn't besides like 6 months in the past 15 years. My moms the one who does everything. And they have an age gap relationship my moms 55 and he is in in his early 40s. All he does is smoke week and drink. And he's bi and he's always messing with men, but I guess my moms okay with it because she knows.. I just don't even know how to go forward with any kind of relationship with them and any advice would be helpful. \n\nMy kids dad passed away 5 years ago and they don't help with Christmas for my kids or anything. Im lucky if they come to my kids birthday parties. But I give my mom stuff for her birthday and even though I struggle I give her money and gifts on mothersday. I just wish my kids had the kind of grandma I had when I was little. But the only family my kids have is me. And this year I'm struggling to even make their Christmas special. Santa is broke. I just miss the mom I use to have. \n\n I never share this stuff with anybody but my therapist so Feel free to give me your input. And if you've delt with anything similar I'd like to know how you handled it. Thank you. ",

    "selftext": "As a child my dad had full custody of me and my mom got me every other weekend. But at a young age say... Between ages 4 and 6 every time she was supposed to come pick me up she would make an excuse as to why she couldn't do it. And it happened every time until eventually my dad asked me if I'd rather go to my grandma's instead (resulting in my grandma becoming the mother in my life) to which I said yeah. So pretty much from that age till senior year in high school I would go to her house for the weekends and spend the summer there as well as half of Christmas break. And didn't see my mother again until 20 years later.\n\nSo now as a 26 year old man I've noticed that when a woman makes plans to see me and doesn't deliver it triggers that distrust and it hurts me a lot. I was looking for advice on how to deal with that. It's stuff that's out of her control I understand that, but it still triggers that distrust and trauma from when my mom did that. She created a very large distrust of females for me which ive managed. But that one thing is what hurts me the most and it makes me feel insignificant and unimportant. Can anybody tell me of some coping mechanisms to help manage that so I don't feel hurt and upset every time it happens?\n\nEDIT: for context they divorced when I was 4 and I don't really remember much from it. They didn't scream in front of me. ",

They're no longer living here now.\n\nShould I speak to my mum about it? I feel so embarrassed even bringing up the topic and most of all I keep thinking why now... after almost a year has passed. I do not have the closest relationship with family but am working on fixing that. In terms of my relationship with the cousin, it's nothing more than perhaps acquaintances like we don't talk much other than \"hey what's happening?\" and the greetings etc.\nIt's a very strange relationship but just the fact that they did it in the room makes me feel uneasy and nervous. The relationship between the family is very strained at the moment so I don't know the best course of action.\n\nI'm away for university now and I don't know why I'm panicking so much. Should I speak to him and confront him about it? I don't want to strain  relationship further but I can't keep quiet about this any longer. It's affecting my mental health so much. I don't feel comfortable at all and just want to confront someone, what do you think I should do?\n\n",

I don't have it in me to talk about this to anyone but I have to speak to someone. This is why I've decided to post this on reddit. Sorry if I sound all over the place\n\nI got mugged 3 days ago in broad daylight. I was just going home back from school and I took the road I usually take. However two guys kept following me and I tried to get away one of them asks me for money and I politely said I didn't have change on me (all I had was a $20 bill). I can't really get into more details yet because this just happened recently but this involved physical as well as verbal violence but I tried to hold my own as much as I could. I don't know how I didn't faint on the spot to be honest. In the end they got away with my $20 bill, they tried to get my backpack away from me but I held on to it as much as I could. In the end they run away and left me alone¬†\n\nI'm still struggling to deal with this and accept that this happened. For context, I was already diagnosed with severe depression as well as PTSD just as recently as two months ago (I have been going through something difficult over the past 2 years), and I'm not doing exactly well recently. I've been told I need to go outside more, take long walks to help cope with my situation. I just don't know what to do now. I've definitely not gone outside these last 3 days.

I tried reading about similar situations online hoping it would calm me down and get me to think more rationally. I just don't know what to do. And the fact that it happened in broad daylight only makes matters worse to me: if I'm not safe then then how the hell am I supposed to get out of the house and pretend everything is fine? I also haven't slept well since then and I'm worried it would get worse over time and I don't want to wait until it's too late, so please if someone can help me I would greatly appreciate it.

After drinking and passing out upstairs, I woke up to find my boyfriend without pants in another room. At first, I thought he had gotten too drunk and just took his pants off. He was incoherent and was in a state I‚Äôve never seen him in before. The next morning, on our drive home, he broke down in tears and revealed that my best friend had sexually assaulted him.\n\nHe explained that, while drinking and on Adderall, my friend gave him something to inhale (later identified as poppers). My fianc√©, could not remember most of the night.  He recalled brief flashes of pain, pushing my friend off, and regaining consciousness only partially. When I confronted my best friend, he denied any involvement, and laughed it off and said my boyfriend just blacked out and took off his own pants, then passed out. \n\nI felt desperate to uncover the truth, so I lied and told him I took my boyfriend to the hospital, where evidence of assault was found. Only then did he admit to fingering and oral sex but continued to insist it was consensual, and he denied everything because he didn‚Äôt want me to hate him or ruin his own relationship. \n\nThe betrayal I feel is overwhelming. This was someone I trusted, and I feel guilt and deep sorrow for bringing my boyfriend into a situation where he was so vulnerable and hurt. My fianc√©(we‚Äôve since been engaged!) who I love deeply and respect immensely, has been courageous throughout this. He sought therapy and medical testing, but the emotional scars remain. I remind him often that this wasn‚Äôt his fault‚Äîthat he was taken advantage of in a state where he couldn‚Äôt defend himself.\n\nWhile he works through his healing, I‚Äôm struggling with mine. I want to be close to him, but intrusive thoughts about the assault have made intimacy difficult. I haven‚Äôt told him how I feel because I don‚Äôt want him to carry any additional shame or guilt. I‚Äôm seeking advice on reframing my thinking, navigating this pain, and rebuilding our intimacy so we can move forward together as a strong, loving couple.",

I thought we were all on the same page about how fucking insane she is, but I overheard my sister say \"he gets mad at everything and starts threatening people\" in reference to me. Now I have told my mum repeatedly when she will not leave me alone that I will remove her, and I have done that every time. But it's just pushing her out of the room, there have been a few times where tripped her to the ground to make her let go of my bike, I slapped her for the same reason another time, and punched her in the sternum again for the same reason. I hope you can see that I was holding back; I'm a young adult male with martial arts training, if I wanted to hurt her I would be in prison. And all of these were after I repeatedly told her exactly what I was going to do.\n\n Now I won't say there's no chance I'm psychotic and can't see it, maybe narcissism is genetic. However with my perspective and from what my dad has just said in unmistakable agreement, it is my mum that starts arguments every single time.\n\n My thinking for my sister hating me is this: I'm the only one that pushes back. When she screams at my sister she just cries and argues a bit until she leaves her room, like I used to. When she screams at my brother he stutters and stammers trying to explain whatever is making her angry to calm her down, it doesn't work. I am the only one who properly pushes back, and as a result of this I'm usually the cause of her biggest tantrums and the most frequent cause too. My sister sees me pushing back, sees my mum losing her shit, and thinks of me as the cause. Her and my brother's strategy is to curl up and let the storm pass, whereas mine is to nuke the thing like Trump.\n\n With ALLLLL of that context now out of the way, what do you guys think? My sister usually doesn't have a bad relationship with me. We range from being friendly and joking with each other to indifference. But when it comes to mum specifically she always takes mum's side, even though she herself is also screamed at a lot.",

He was super physical and was all over me. He then asked me to get dinner with him sometime last week, which I dodged. Last night, I went out with my friends to celebrate Halloween again. It was pretty late, and a big group (maybe 20?) of us ended up in someone‚Äôs dorm. It was like a small party, and it was actually pretty fun. At that point, most of us, including me, were very drunk. The guy who likes me was so high and drunk that, within the last hour, he had asked me who I was. (We have known each other for a little while now, and my friends have confirmed he does like me.) We were in the dorm and I fell onto one of the beds in the room (people were using the beds like couches). The guy who likes me was also on that couch. First, he got touchy again and was hugging me/putting his arms around me. Then, he said, ‚Äúdo you like me, yes or no?‚Äù And I didn‚Äôt know how to respond because while I have been enjoying the feeling of being liked, I don‚Äôt actually like him. He has made me feel uncomfortable. I told him, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm drunk,‚Äù and he was like ‚Äúthat‚Äôs when the truth comes out,‚Äù and then he asked me the same question again. I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable saying no to him, and he kept persisting, so I eventually said ‚Äúsure‚Äù (as in sure I liked him). Then he was like ‚Äúcan I kiss you?‚Äù And I was so drunk that I could barely see what was going on around me. I didn‚Äôt say anything, and before I even knew it, his mouth was on mine. I was so drunk that I wasn‚Äôt really in control of my body, so I wasn‚Äôt even capable of kissing him back. For context, I was lying on the bed on my back at that point, and he was on top of me. There was also a wall next to the bed, so I didn‚Äôt really have anywhere to go. I didn‚Äôt really consent to being kissed, and I was very drunk, but at the same time, I did (inaccurately) sorta tell him I liked him (I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable saying no), and I didn‚Äôt push him away or anything like that. \n\nMore context: this was also my first kiss\n\nEdit: to top it all off, I then had a dream where a shooter came to our campus and found me because he was looking for me specifically, and he was trying to get on top of me and attack me. However, in the dream, I fought back, which I didn‚Äôt do in the dorm bed with the guy",

Also sorry if anything is worded poorly it's very late for me. \n\n\nMy mental health has been not great for a while, and there have been huge gaps in my childhood memory for a while and they really bothered me. I've been trying to think of what my childhood was like by looking at pictures, things I made, stories others tell me, and objects. There is this one object that makes me feel a bit uncomfortable, and its a spoon with my name written on it in fancy calligraphy and it used to have a ribbon on it. Apparently it was mainly used to hit me when I did something wrong, and I assume this happened often enough for there to be a dedicated tool for it. Apparently I was a very loud and crazy child, I would have loud outbursts and tantrums, so I guess it makes sense why that happened. \n\nMy family was otherwise very loving I think. They are very kind to me and don't do it anymore now that I'm 16. This makes me more confused. I don't get how someone can be both loving and protective, and frightening and dangerous. Even though they were and are loving, I sometimes felt like they didn't love me since it felt like they were never there emotionally. I don't really understand friendships or relationships very well, sometimes I don't get why my friends don't hurt or bully me, and I don't understand relationships that don't have one person hurting another. \n\nSometimes I remember the feeling/process of it, sometimes there are strange sensations over my body of the feeling of getting hit, occasionally I see strange and upsetting images of what it was like. These make me feel the fear and dread again. It's really uncomfortable and I hate it. I hate how I remember basically nothing but can feel the bad memories in detail. Since I've been thinking about it recently I've been having more of these feelings and it's almost unbearable.\n\nIt really confuses me how this is affecting me this much. Physical punishment is quite a normal thing to do. Almost everyone I know has had this happen to them, and they seem to just laugh it off. I also don't know how much of an impact it had on me, since I don't know what I was like beforehand. To add to the confusion, I can hardly remember much, so I don't actually know what it was like. \n\nI worry about using something serious like trauma as a buzzword, since a lot of people misuse psychology terms to describe normal things. From what I've heard about trauma it only describes horrifying extraordinary situations outside the range of normal experience, not something that most people go through. \n",

I'm hoping this can be a place where I can express myself openly and maybe find some support.\n\n  \nLately I've been feeling a little bit more drawned than usual. I am a 28 year old woman with a backstory involving a **lot** of sexual abuse and lately, I just don't know where I should pull my strength from anymore. \n\nEverything started with my biological mom. She met my dad (who was the face of her own father and also the age). They fell in love, got pregnant and married over a one year time. The rumors were terrible: my nannies had to take me out of the house, while my dad was working, because my mom took some dudes over, each at a time, and they'd scream, slaping sounds or make any sexual weird noises and I had to be rushed out of the house. \n\nTheir relationship didn‚Äôt last. My mom kicked my dad out while he was traveling, and almost immediately, another man was living with us. I still remember his name. Looking back, I realize how many men she brought into my life, and I think I was lucky that none of them was violent towards me. In fact, at the beggining, my mom did all that part.\n\nAfter this time, there's a lot of confusion in my memories, specially because I was 2 / 3 at the time and they got into a lot of fights, I got to a lot of different homes with her or with him. It was all very confusing since I didn't have a routine, parents that could give me any good models or reliability in general. \n\nI remember always feeling like a circus attraction. She used to expose me to everybody, proudly saying she made me, encouraging people to touch me, look at me while she asked me to dance, sing, smile and be pretty.\n\nI was only 3-4 years and I use to wake up in the middle of the night, in her lap, while we were in a bar. I still had my pijamas and no shoes, in a fucking weird and unkown place, with all thar drinking and cigarettes.\n\n After living like this for a while (there are more details but I'm trying to resume a little and be quick), mom got married with this guy we'll call Joel. I remember him so well. He was tall (I'm almost 5 at this moment), dark hair, thick glasses, deep voice and smelled like a nice perfume mixed with malboro red.   \nJoel was the best with me, I guess he was the first one to find out how my mom treated me. He felt weird about her, I could see in his eyes. She got very drunk, they used to have sex and then big huge fights, but mostly her yelling something that even she didn't know because she was just so so drunk all the time she could. \n\nWhile we lived with Joel, she started to get worse. I had a nanny at the time, and was left alone too much time with her and the 11yld son. Obviously, it didn't go well. Oficially, I entered the *be-abused* world to only get out at the age of 24. \n\nHe used to always try to get alone with me. Touched me, my body, rubbed himself against me and, I even remember one time he putted his dick in my butt. Yup, I was 5.  So far, it could only be children playing 'they don't know what they're doing', sure. Nobody found out, nobody ever knew and nobody was even suspiscious. \n\nThis was happening continuously, until the nanny never showed up again. Wich meant that everything should be done by my mom. Taking care of the house, of me, cooking everyday...\n\nThings got a little calmer. My mom wasn't even drikning that much wich helped a lot with the beatings, cigarette burns and yelling out of nowhere. Unfortunately, I got invited to be the ring bearer for my teacher-at-the-time wedding and this peace wouldn't last long. \n\nWhen we went to the wedding, it was beautiful. I felt great, had fun, and everybody seems to like me. Felt like I was safe, my friends from school were there, my teachers and Joel. Fun! \n\nAfter this great evening, when we came back home, very tired, my mom took me straight to my room -which i tought it was weird since I always took a shower before bed, and locked the door. Of course, I could smell her breath of *i-had-too-many-beers* and was so scared, not understanding what was going to happen. \n\nShe putted me on top of the bed, took of all my clothes, leaving only the underware and man, she started to beat the shit out of me. Idk how long that lasted, but I remember listening to Joel desperately trying to get in, yelling to her to stop doing whatever she was, but she wasn't listening to anything. Felt like she was in a transe, punishing me for being so loved, for having fun. I don't know, I just couldn't understand what I had done wrong that time. But with her, I never did. \n\nFinally, Joel kicked the door open and got her out. He locked her in their room, I think he slapped her and after things got a little quieter, he came back to take care of me, I took my shower, went to bed, not syaing a word -how would I dare to do so, and went to bed. I remember waking up in the middle of the night and seeing her laying on the ground, sleeping in her guilt. I was so disgusted but also thankfull for her being there. \n\nAfter this, they separeted. We were living in a house, of a favor, and there were a couple, male and female kids 12 and 15ages. There, they wouldn't give me the food my mom bought, just pure rice. (i guess it was something). Here it was much stranger. The family there was odd, it really felt that we were bothering them all the time and, at this house, I also got someones attetion. This time, it was the girl. She was always wanting to play under the covers and asking me stuff like '*do you know how to kiss*' and asked me to kiss '*down there*'. Remember, I was still 5 at the time and she was 15. This happened a lot of times, I really felt weird but didn't understand at all what was happening and I thought, ever since we could sleep and eat there as a favor, I should do as asked, always. \n\nFinally, I think the Mom had a glimpse of sanity and asked the dad's family if I could stay with them while she looked for houses, apartments or any healthy place we could stay. \n\nWhile this was all happening, I remember of discovering myself at a very young age. My sexuallity was very estimulated over this last year and I was starting to discover I could touch myself so I got caught several doing it. Not very good for the age. \n\nAfter I change houses (and family) things got better for a couple of years, finally. I got to a place where there were rules, stability, reliability, controled enviroment, a lot of food and a tv channel that had only cartoons. \n\n  \n  \n\\*hello! **Thank you if you read so far**. Today was very hard to write this, so I'll stop a little and come back to finish later. It's weird to just talk about stuff like this because, well, nobody never wants to talk about it and, when I open up, people usually get very sad, frustrated and anxious. \n\nTbh, it's always very frustrating to share. People or say that I should just forget it, get over it and stop \"dragging chains from the past\" but nobody wants to help during the healing part. \n\n\\*\\*Forgive me for any grammar mistakes, feel free to teach me! Not my first language.",

    "title": "Can Psychedelics Help Reorder the Mind and Heal Trauma?",
    "selftext": "I‚Äôve been looking into some fascinating theories on how psychedelics like psilocybin might help people recover from trauma, and they‚Äôve really shifted my perspective on why these experiences can feel so transformative. The analogy that stood out to me was thinking of the mind as a snow globe.\n\nWhen we go through trauma, it‚Äôs like the ‚Äúsnowflakes‚Äù in our minds‚Äîthoughts, memories, and emotions‚Äîsettle into rigid, stuck patterns. Over time, these fixed grooves keep us trapped in old responses and perspectives. Psychedelics seem to ‚Äúshake up‚Äù the snow globe, breaking those trauma-based patterns and allowing us to see things from a new perspective.\n\nHere‚Äôs a quick breakdown of how this might work:\n\n1. Epigenetic Reset ‚Äì Trauma can leave ‚Äúimprints‚Äù on our DNA expression, locking us into survival responses. Psychedelics may help reset these, opening new, healthier pathways in the mind.\n\n\n2. Restoring Harmony ‚Äì Trauma disrupts mental ‚Äúharmony.‚Äù Psychedelics might act like a tuning fork, helping us reconnect to a balanced state and a sense of collective healing.\n\n\n3. Softening Rigid Paths ‚Äì Trauma creates deep grooves in our mental landscape, trapping us in reactive loops. Psychedelics could help smooth out these pathways, giving us flexibility for new ways of thinking and feeling.\n\n\n4. Anchoring New Patterns ‚Äì After a psychedelic session, people often report long-lasting positive shifts. Scientists think psychedelics might help create stable mental patterns that ‚Äúanchor‚Äù us in new, healthier perspectives.\n\n\n5. Quantum Coherence ‚Äì This one‚Äôs a bit heady, but there‚Äôs a theory that psychedelics might help the brain sync up at a quantum level, allowing thoughts and memories to realign and integrate more clearly.\n\nThese ideas suggest psychedelics could help us heal by disrupting trauma-based patterns and allowing our minds to find new harmony and balance.\n\nHas anyone here had experience with psychedelics in their healing journey? Would love to hear if these ideas resonate with anyone!\n\nPsychedelics shaking up trauma and reordering consciousness (https://myco-method.com/f/psychedelics-shaking-up-trauma-and-reordering-consciousness)\n",

    "selftext": "I am hoping that my story will start a dialogue or to get feedback from somebody to help me process as well as shed light on what I believe about the power of the brain, mind, will to survive and specifically flight mode. This would be the perfect AMA.\n\nAt 41 years old, my mind was fueled by a question from my mom about if I had a specific memory from my childhood. This, coupled with anger at my father for a cocaine relapse triggered an onslaught of memories being recalled. I was broken in a spiral that I came out of after three weeks of processing 2-3 days straight at a time without sleep or eating.  My life fell apart rapidly, but at the same time improved exponentially.\n\nBoth parents 60 years old. I am the oldest, a boy with two sisters. my sister is five years younger than me while my youngest sister is 17  years younger. Parents divorced when I was 19. My story involves three male predators. My father, my uncle by marriage and my grandpa. The patriarch on my mothers side who is 93 currently. My ex uncle died two years ago and the last time I spoke to my dad was six months ago. I have three cousins each of us within a year of each other. The oldest a girl with the two boys in the middle and the youngest a girl. Two sisters traumatized by my father as well. Six children total. The two female cousins were affected by my father and my uncle. Cousin, like a brother was affected with me the two uncles and my grandpa. The men also knew about each other. \n\nOne specific incidents was walked into by my mom and turned into a house being purchased by my grandpa as a payoff to my mom who was negatively influenced by her five sisters to just keep it a secret, only blinded by my grandpa and move on as my grandmother was in the midst of a nervous breakdown spending two weeks in the hospital, and the behavior was allowed to continue for one of the men and three of the children. My father, myself and my two sisters. My grandpa stopped and my Aunt divorced my uncle. In the span of a year from ages 4-5 my parents separated, but my dad was still allowed to have alone time with me. My mom became pregnant with my little sister and at five years old. The house was back together.. .\n\nDuring a 3 week spin I validated dates through background checks and conversations with a few family members, even gaslighters tell you something if you ask the same question differently to each person. In the blink of an eye, I was a victim of complex childhood trauma, and suffering from CPTSD. My wheels came to a halt. One thing I‚Äôve never experienced before was mania and this was it full force. Due to the volume of information I had to come to terms with. I handled it well looking back.\n\nI disassociated at 1 1/2 years old and I was disassociated the major majority of time through 10 years old. In fact, the first time I disassociated was my first memory, according to my recall and my first real waking memory was turning down a sexual advance by an older child that I learned to accept over the years. Pretty much zero memories but enough stories from my family growing up that served as memories. I‚Äôm also gifted and diagnosed AuDHD, high functioning but questioning everything currently. The word trigger is now part of my vocabulary, no interest in guns. The triggers become less as time goes by but still too many to name. They range from alcohol aisles, drugs, words of affirmation, my mouth on the inside to name a short few. \n",

You are not alone üíö LOVE\n\n‚Äî\n\nMy childhood was quite the ride, at times I feel it would‚Äôve been better if my dad had really made me die. He sure knew how to make his son cry. Abuse to abuse, I was told by the ones I loved, ‚ÄòBoy, you‚Äôre making excuse after excuse.‚Äô These things don‚Äôt happen to boys like you. Was the Spider-Man shirt I wore too inviting? Did I do this to myself because I refused my dad‚Äôs call to learn how to fight? I had no idea what I had experienced, so I put my heart up on the shelf. My pride was broken, my past is full of pain. I used to think my life was a spilled mess, but now I know it‚Äôs just a stain. Growing up, I just knew I wanted to help others. The sad part about this is I‚Äôm here with you and I can‚Äôt even help my own brother. If that was bad, wait until we talk about my mother. That lady‚Äôs crazy‚Ä¶ But that lady took me back in when she got out of prison and she loved me and showed me what it meant to be a man and how to treat a lady. If I‚Äôm being real? That woman made me. Looking back, I always find myself in disbelief‚Ä¶ I couldn‚Äôt believe that my parents were growing up themselves right beside me‚Ä¶ Life is different now, I‚Äôm in a different town and surround myself with a different crowd. People, places, things, substance abuse led to me throwing away all of my childhood dreams. But one remains‚Ä¶ How can I help others not become the same? How can I guide another to never feel that pain?\n\nI met my wife in the most beautiful of ways. A typical dating app and a girl over a thousand miles away made my days. I drove‚Ä¶ weekend after weekend‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúYes, mom I‚Äôm just down the street‚Äù as I‚Äôm sitting in a Chicago Cubs seat. My grandma was on her deathbed and we were bouncing around taking care of her, when I got the call that the time was near. I was there‚Ä¶ then I was told she would make it; so I did too, back to Illinois and back to see the one girl who saw ME. She didn‚Äôt understand what I had to gain but she saw through my soul and knew I was in pain. I disclosed my substance abuse from the start, maybe the bad boy persona came across kind of attractive. But slowly and surely, our love grew and grew, and then she packed up and started her life anew. Together, we went on a limb and eloped. Man, I wish you could see this love story from my perspective. She saved me, but not because she stayed through hardships, but because she gave me my baby. We call her Sage‚Äôy.\n\nMy story is weird and I don‚Äôt even know what led me here.

    "title": "Addressing my traumas - living in a narcissistic household",
    "selftext": "Where to begin.\n\nGiven everything I've seen on reddit, I don't believe I've had an overly tough life. But boy does it feel like it sometimes.¬†\n\n**My Family Picture:**¬†I'm a 25M with three younger brothers, Dad 45M, Mum 45F, Step-Dad 44M. The youngest two brothers are from my Mum's current marriage.¬†\n\nI‚Äôm not sure whether it's trauma or my lack of brain capacity, but I don't have many memories of my childhood... I‚Äôm not sure whether I blocked them out or I can't remember - can a therapist can explain this?\n\nFrom the age of 5 my parents have been divorced. My mum has since re-married to my step-dad or as I call him the¬†**Devil Incarnate**. This man has been in my life for longer than I can remember and I can honestly say I hate him, pure¬†**visceral hate.**\n\nHe is a literal man child. My first memory of him was being sat in his gaming room, just watching as a kid and trying to give my opinion or helping him win. Next thing you know he's swearing and shouting at me, telling me to get out of the room.¬†\n\nThe memories of him progress from there. I remember we moved to his city and his house. Which means he had his friends there, this would result in drunken nights where he would cause arguments with my mum. To the point where he was kicking doors down, making the whole house shake and screaming the place down for no reason at all, other than he was drunk. Again this progressed to the point where he would physically hit my mum, but nothing changes after this.¬†\n\nAt some point my dad caught wind of what was happening in that house and as you can imagine he was not very happy. We came back to my dad's house one day during the summer holidays, to which him and my mum started arguing and it got heated to the point where my dad ended up with a coffee table over his head and throwing it across the room. This is anger, I have never seen from him before or since.\n\nThings did get better for a little bit, when my mum moved back to our home city where she had her own house and the step-dad only came to visit to see his son. However this was shorted lived, as he soon wormed his way back into our lives. Eventually living with us again, and as you can imagine some people never change. More of the same drinking and arguing ensued for years and years.\n\nOddly enough I distinctly remember a lot of arguing happening on a Thursday evening. My younger brother had already had enough and left our house to live with our dad, as he hated my step-dad and resented my mum for staying with him.¬†\n\nTo this day I am used a communication tool between that brother and my mum, as they rarely speak so I have to try bring them together or even get them to talk. Often times I would have to comfort my youngest brothers who would be balling their eyes out in their room.¬†\n\nAgain arguments became physical, loud and aggressive. A lot of the times things in the house were broken from the arguments and at times my mum would have black eyes. To the point where sometimes, I would message the neighbour to call the police (not that they did). This is where I realised, there are not many people out there that will help you.\n\nBesides, countless other things he's done when drunk, one including walking into the hall where are shoes are kept thinking it's the bathroom and pissing over all our school shoes... The day before school, with my mum having to clean up his mess.\n\nWhen I was around 10 it was just me and my mum in the house. My dad and brother were at their house, which was a 5 mins walk away. I heard a glass smash downstairs and I come down to see that my mum is cutting her arm with a broken glass. I couldn't get her to stop.¬†\n\nSo, I had to phone my dad to help but maybe I didn't explain the urgency as my dad seemed to be taking a while to get there. So, I had to get on my bike and pedal as fast as I could to get to my dad, I met him half way and told him she was bleeding, to which he started running. He couldn't get her to stop cutting, in the end he had to threaten to calling the police before she would stop.¬†\n\nFast forward a few years, the normal cycle of arguing and drinking has continued. When I was 14 we had a street party. This included all 4 younger brothers, my mum, step-dad & his sister with her two kids. As you can imagine there was plenty of drinking going on. Again my step-dad went too far, to the point at which he was outside the house trying to dance with other women.¬†\n\nMy mum managed to get him in the house and us kids were now in our rooms. He was arguing and wanting to continue the party and to keep drinking, he came upstairs and threw up in the hallway, went to their bedroom and came back out the room accusing other people for throwing up, blaming everyone else in the house. Again screaming, shouting & kicking doors around the house, at this point his sister was so scared she took her kids and left.¬†\n\nAfter which he proceeded to punch holes in the walls and TV. He then went downstairs continuing to argue, then falling into self pity ending up picking up a knife in the kitchen threatening to cut him himself (police now phoned) he continued to bellow and cry saying his kids don't love him. He did end up cutting into himself, making his arm bleed deep enough that both the police and ambulance were needed at the house to take him away. Still, my mum let him back in the house the next day, as she took care of his arm.\n\nThe cycle continues.\n\nI think this is it for now, my younger years were the peak of the mountain for me, but that doesn‚Äôt mean this has stopped. He is still here, he may be older but his narcissitic behaviour is still plaguing our lives, as for my mum she doesn‚Äôt get any better.¬†\n\nTyping has been a form of therapy for me, maybe I‚Äôll share more in the future.¬†\n\nThank you to those to took the time to read it. If you have unfortunately related to this or are going through the same thing, I hope you have a good support network around you and you are taking the time to heal.",

    "title": "Demand avoidance with studying language that comes from trauma",
    "selftext": "I recently realized that my demand avoidance with studying French comes from immigration trauma. I'm a refugee living in France, I have been here for 1.5 years. I had a choice and didn't have a choice when I was moving. I had some time to prepare and make choices, but ultimately I had to move out of danger and necessity. Now I can't go back and I miss my family. They can't come to visit me. I struggle with learning French. I just don't do it. I had periods of time when I was learning it and I learned reading rules, some words and phrases, some grammar. But I still don't know enough to pass A1 level and it creates constant obsticles in my life. I'm autistic and I struggle with demand avoidance but in this case I think the struggle comes from trauma. I guess I would like someone kind and understanding to talk to me about it here because discussing it in a moderated spaces helps me.\n\n\n\nMentally, I just refuse to study it because I am forced to. I avoid opening learning apps or practicing. I know I have to, but the realization that I don't have a choice and that I must study it is so hard, I can't comply with it. I feel like I don't have freedom to choose, so I just don't do it. I get by with translation app, asking my friends to help and finding businesses that speak English. But overall it's tough living in France and not speaking but not even trying to speak French.\n\n\n\nIt's not about how to study it or what to study. I used to love studying languages, I studied several difficult languages and I loved it. But I never had to. I learned them just out of curiousity and love, I didn't specifically plan to move and use the language I studied. Now, it's all different. People tell me that I have to study, that I must, that I don't have a choice. And it's emotionally so hard with this idea. As an autistic person, compliying with the demand that is put upon me, even if it's a natural consequence of my own decision to move here, feels like a violence. I'm sensitive to injustice that I experience as an immigrant in a foreign country. \n\n\n\nI'm overall doing okay, I have a safe place to live, a remote job and an okayish support system. I have some skills to support myself, and I have a therapist, though she's new and I'm still not sure about it. I've recently had a traumatic experience with an unprofessional therapist who judged me too, but I recovered a little bit. \n\n\n\nI seriously struggle with lots of things in my daily life and I'm not getting enough support with things. And to make real progress I need to be putting time into French but it makes me so sad to think about practicing it. The idea of studying French is like the idea of me having no choice in life and not being able to decide what to do. Even if ultimately it's a good thing and it will bring me more choices and more independance, I feel heartbroken thinking that so many people expect me to learn it and actively judge me for not doing it or not having progress fast enough.",

    "selftext": "And while we're on that, can sexual trauma truly change a person's sexual orientation? (IE from allo to ace or bi to gay?)\n\nI'm born into an eastern European family, both of my parents of which dealt with heavy poverty trauma & domestic abuse as a result of the Soviet Union. I, however, was born in the states. I fully recognize & completely respect that different cultures have different ways of displaying familial affection & have different views on nudity, but that's where the problem lies in my case. \n\nI was born into a westernized American mindset, surrounded by adamant \"pure\" values with a contradicting sexual culture (what the hell is up with the states & their obsession with stepcest?), while everything was different back at home. I have very vivid memories of my mother being fully topless if not outright naked in front of me when I was in elementary school, though I can't remember how long it lasted for. After that she would always walk around in a bra & lacey underwear, and she always makes inappropriate jokes & moans, even if nonsexually, every single chance she gets. She also has an unhealthy obsession with me, never letting me go places alone meaning I was always the only one in the event with a parent hovering over me. She would always stroke my whole legs slowly & kiss my neck. She still treats me infantilizingly to this day.\n\nHere's the thing, I doubt that most if any of her behavior was with sexual or abusive **intent,** whether influenced by her trauma or culture or neither, but I still ended up so scarred from the way she treated me my whole life. I used to consider myself proudly bisexual, but now I call myself gay because the female body & gender deeply triggers me. I'm scared of female breasts, I despise the vulva, the feminine voice scares me, the very thought of being intimate with anyone of a feminine gender (including trans women obviously) makes me so panicked, disgusted & feel in danger. And I can't watch any porn involving women + memes of that nature because their moans trigger me so, so heavily. I can't even make myself feel comfortable with trans men who haven't undergone a total 180 medical transition, which makes me feel horrible because it feels like my triggers invalidate their identity. \n\nI don't know what this problem is though. Is this sexual trauma? Or is it an unfortunate clash between different cultural norms with generational trauma in the mix? Has my orientation really changed? Or is it possible for it to turn back at some point in the distant future?",

    "title": "Not sure why a one-off interaction still upsets me me days later",
    "selftext": "TW suicidal ideation.\n\nI work in a public library which is frequented by homeless customers and mentally unwell customers, so I am not unused to intense interactions. I have also worked as a volunteer phone counsellor for at-risk young people. I have dealt with my share of upsetting encounters, including talking to people who are suicidal, and can usually shake them off ok.\n\nThree days ago, a young male customer wearing headphones came into the library about ten minutes after we opened, so very early in the morning. It was just myself and another staff member on the floor - we work in a multi-floor library, on the top floor. \n\nWhile standing near me, the customer announced to the room (not looking at me) that he had run out of food, that no one cared about him or would help him, and so he was going to throw himself off the library balcony and end his life.\n\nI tried to talk to him, but as he had headphones on he didn't notice me. I then went and got the other member of staff, M, to help me talk to him. M tapped the customer on the shoulder and he took off his headphones, and together we both had a conversation with the customer, listened to his problems, and got him some help, some food, and then I went and got the building manager.\n\nBoth M and I were commended later by our bosses for how well and calmly we handled the situation. But for some reason we were both really distressed by the interaction for hours later and were both crying at our desks, even M who is a stoic man in his 40s cried twice. I felt either dissociated and blank, or on the verge of tears, all day and so asked to leave work early.\n\nWhat I can't work out is why we were so upset by the interaction and why it seems to have been so traumatic for both of us. M and I are both used to dealing with customers who are aggressive, even violent. I have counselled suicidal people over the phone before and never been so deeply affected.\n\nM and I discussed it and M wondered if it was partly because the customer was around our own age and highly articulate, so we (fairly or unfairly) may have understood and empathised with him more easily than we might have with another customer. \n\nI also think it was that the customer was very gentle and friendly, and very accepting of our help, which is not the norm for us in this kind of situation. He unzipped his backpack to show us his only remaining food, a bag of instant noodles, and when we offered to cook it up for him he was really grateful. When I offered him a hot milo he said yes please and drank it gratefully. \n\nLuckily the library social worker was onsite so we got her and she and my boss talked to him, although I remember feeling heartbroken and angry that they could not offer him more help than a list of charities to reach out to. \n\nHe told us he had run out of money and couldn't afford rent, and he felt he didn't have any options left or anyone to help him. He seemed embarrassed and ashamed of causing a scene and even said he was \"sorry for being silly\" for threatening jump off the balcony. \n\nHe then sat quietly and politely for over an hour when one of us wasn't talking to him, but whenever we talked to him, his distress was clear in everything he said, he spoke loudly and frantically and  kept saying things like \"people just keep turning me away\" and \"I've run out of options\" and there was so much pain and fear in his eyes and voice. \n\nI felt disappointed in myself for not being able to stay with the customer and talk to him for longer. This wasn't because of a job requirement but because I didn't know what to do besides tell him \"please don't kill yourself, we can get you help\" and go and get him a milo. I  think he did feel like a bomb to us, just like how he said people saw him, and I felt guilt for being afraid to sit down with him and actually talk to him and even hold his hand or something. \n\nNone of us, not even my boss or the social worker, spent very long with him or had a proper, involved conversation with him. I keep thinking about him and wondering if he is ok, and wishing I had done more to help him.\n\nIf you've read this far, thank you. I think it's helpful for me to write this out. I wondered if you would have any insight as to why this incident may have affected me so much, and how I could help myself both move forward emotionally and prepare better for a similar situation, so that I can help the next person in crisis better.\n\nThank you.",

Both roads are valid human responses, tbh. Which road did you take? And if you want to share your story, I'd be interested in hearing it :)",

    "selftext": "Hello,  \nI've been through something over 2 years ago, and I still can't come to terms with what happened. This has impacted my sleep, the way I treat others, and how I view myself.  \nI just woke up thinking about this, and I've finally realized that this might be trauma.  \nTwo years ago, I was 22, as dumb and stupid as I am now, but even worse. I went to a free-entry party near where I live by myself. There, I met some people, talked to a few others, and took some dubious products bought from a local salesperson‚Äî all things normal at a trance music party.  \nEverything went smoothly and normally until morning. I sat next to a group of people who were very keen on accepting me and engaging with me. I remember one of them was from the military, and we were discussing things of the sort.\n\nA woman sat next to us; we'll call her Lucile.   \nLucile was French and didn't speak a word of either my language or English, but we engaged with each other nonetheless. She was cute. The group I was talking to decided to leave for some reason, and there I was, alone with her, trying my best to communicate with this person. We held hands, used her phone's translator, and I found out she was at least 8 years older than me. We talked about french writers.  \n  \nThen, a group of three ü•∑ guys approached us. One of them shouted in my language, \"Get up!\" As you might remember, I wasn't sober at all, and my instincts didn't kick in, so I got up. One of them, the one who shouted, kept talking to me, and the other two sat next to Lucile, one on each side.  \nThey kissed her, and all the while, the guy talking to me was asking me for cigarettes.  \n  \nSome part of me wants to believe that she accepted being kissed; another part thinks she did it because she was afraid. I was afraid of being beaten by these three huge guys, and all I could do was stay there to keep watch in case they tried to grape her or something worse. I stood there until they left, and when they did, she also left to rejoin her group of friends. This whole thing lasted for at least 15 minutes.   \nA lot of people saw this happening, but no one did anything.  \n  \nI feel like a loser and a weakling because I couldn't do anything to stop this from happening. I've never felt like this or been through anything like this in my entire life. As a teenager, I would‚Äôve gotten into that fight and probably wouldn‚Äôt be here to tell the story. I wish I had brought my gun, but at the same time, I'm glad I didn't, as I could‚Äôve killed the three of them, and I guess I would‚Äôve killed myself afterward. Maybe if I had, I wouldn‚Äôt have to experience all this shame and guilt.  \n  \nNow, if I ever have a wife, I'll have this in the back of my mind all the time, thinking that anyone might come up to us and try to do something to her, and I won‚Äôt ever be strong enough to defend her.  \n  \nWhat conclusion should I draw from this? What's the lesson to be learned here?  \nTo avoid places like these at all costs? (learned)  \nTo not take dubious products from random merchants? (learned)  \nTo always carry a weapon?  \nTo hit the gym, do martial arts, regain my self-confidence, and one day get beaten by a guy twice my height and weight, who‚Äôll take my wife afterward?\n\nThere‚Äôs that. I don‚Äôt feel better after writing this.",

Closest tag I could find for a TW, even if it's not exact. I have an older sister, two years older than me. When we were kids, I grew up young and naive, very sheltered, emotionally abused and very vulnerable and easily influenced. I just wanted to someone to understand and accept me. The earliest memory I have of this specific trauma was my sister convincing me to skinny dip in my dad's pool with her secretly. Then it later, when I was older progressed to stuff like her unlocking (picking the very easy to pick lock) the bathroom while I was showering to get a qtip, and she'd always look at me and make comments about how I was \"fat\" and then I'd cry. She'd pet my arms which she knew I hated and repeat shit like \"you're in love with me aren't you?\" Played firetruck on me once (though stopped before it got more rapey than it already is as a game). Did some like tik Tok trick to find out what someone's moan sounds like on me when the app first got popular. The petting thing she did to me constantly, even her wife has to tell her to stop fucking touching me awhile back. She Told me it was all cause she was trying to get me to admit I liked girls (I'm biologically female and she'd always call me gay, especially when my best friend was around). But it's like oh so you're using yourself as an example tho? It's fucking weird and it drove me mad as a kid. She was naked in front of me constantly without my consent. She'd just walk around like that half we were home alone too. Her saying I liked her constantly fucked with me as a kid. It drove me mad, I started to hate myself because I was like why is she saying that to me, there must be some sort of reason. And it was like gaslighting, after being told so many times I started to doubt myself as a kid even though I know for a fact that I never liked or loved her, not even in a sisterly way much less a gross ass romantic way not even for a second. It got to the point that by the time I was a little older I was used to her being naked around me and behaving this way It became normal. When I finally woke up to what the fuck was happening as an adult, my mom said she was just teasing me. What the fuck could the intention of her actions be in this case? Any ideas? Cause aside from this we were normal bickering scheming sisters who didn't really get along at all. \n \nAnyone have a guess what was happening there or what was going through my sisters head? There's more specifics I don't feel like specifying, and there's a lot of stuff I don't remember but I will say I don't remember her ever flat out blatantly doing anything really bad, but I just want some advice.

I loved her and wanted to spend my life with her but in the end it turned out she was cheating on me, lying, gaslighting, belittling, taking advantage and pretty much every trick in the book. I begged her to stay and work on this with me or leave so I can heal. She left our apartment and ghosted me. That whole situation is burned to the ground and the earth was salted a long time ago.\n\nI felt so betrayed and this was the hardest period of my life but I fought for myself and now feel like my normal self, back on my feet, have my self worth and have had better partners. The one thing that is still lingering is - how I  wake up in the middle of the night almost every day. Some random situation in my dreams reminds me of my ex or her behaviour, my heart starts rushing anxiously, and I wake up without being able to fall asleep again.\n\n\nAny experience with this, or any ideas how I can fix my sleep so my subconscious stays calm all night?

It was probably for the best. \n\nI spent a lot of time growing up with my best friends family and by growing up I mean around 4-8 years old and I don‚Äôt mean like play dates I know I spent a lot of time there my memories aren‚Äôt entirely clear but for reference I even had a birthday party at their house once that is how much time I spent with them. ( if you ask me where my parents were I can‚Äôt really answer I have no real memories from that time minus everything that family did for me and I have a lot of amazing memories they use to take me on holidays her mom used to include me in so many creative activities she really ensured I had a decent childhood - not that my mom didn‚Äôt but you know what I mean) \n\nAt some point my mom got engaged to a man they bought a house and we stayed there it was a stunning house but it all fell apart if I remember correctly he cheated on my mom (I remember her cries as we had to sell the house because she couldn‚Äôt afford it on her own I think I was 6 ish at this point) my mom then moved with me to another smaller place I didn‚Äôt mind I had a cool garden and room. My mom crashed her new car almost maybe 6/7 months after buying it she ran it up a poll while trying to find her phone under the car seat. I was in the car we were fine but car was totalled. I think this was the final straw for her. A couple weeks or months I‚Äôm not sure of timing I was in grade 1/2 at the time I wake up in the morning like any small child go to the kitchen grab some cereal and watch my cartoons. My mom‚Äôs phone is ringing non stop but I can hear she isn‚Äôt answering it. Which is so strange for her she isn‚Äôt a heavy sleeper so I went to go and check you know what is happening. I find her lying there with her eyes wide open just staring not understanding the situation I answer the phone (my best friends mom is on the line panicking. She is asking me where my mom is I say to her she is next to me but not answering then I think something clicked my little head that something wasn‚Äôt right I say to my friends mom she is lying on the bed with her eyes wide open she asks me to shake my mom I do but no response) the friend says to me she will be over soon I need to try open the house and find out if my mom took something . I‚Äôm 6/7 I‚Äôm not sure what I should be looking for my mom also used to keep the house keys out of reach so I couldn‚Äôt just I guess leave so I was climbing up a chair to try get the key her friend arrives was frustrated with me or the situation I‚Äôm not sure. She asks me to open which i struggle todo and this women searches the house for what my mom must of taken, she finds 2 boxes of sleeping tablets empty grabs them and throws my mom on her back tells me to follow her as she climbed down the stairs I am crying now at this point (my friends mom says to me why are you crying the isn‚Äôt the first time) now I‚Äôm not sure what other time she is referring too but this is the only time i can remember. The friends mom gets my mom to the hospital and they take her in I wasn‚Äôt allowed to see her at all during this process. When she got out I was told I needed to stay with my dad (I had never stayed with him longer then a weekend before this so that was very hard) my mom then moved across the country to be with her family and I was with my dad. I was sent to court ordered child psychologist at this point I just remember colouring in. At my dad‚Äôs house I was left alone or with my slightly older siblings for most of the days if I wasn‚Äôt in school. My dad would work weekends and I would be alone at home if my siblings were at their moms house (different mother to me) I am 7/8 at this point bear in mind. I would walk myself to the store to get a dvd or I would roam around the neighbourhood looking for friends and now that I look back I was so lucky I was never like abducted. My dad is the reason I knew Santa and the tooth fairy didn‚Äôt exist for Christmas I saw a pair of those shoes with the wheels on that I thought were cool probably a week before Christmas he grabbed them and said to me there is your gift don‚Äôt ask for anything else. I do have some good memories from my dad‚Äôs house don‚Äôt get me wrong. Like my siblings and I would jump off the house roof into the pool, we had that fondue stuff for dinner, I played age of the empires all the time. But I was alone a lot. And then at the end of grade two I was sent to my mom again who acted like nothing happened . But I have been so scared in my adult life to have kids because of my experiences but I have a loving husband and a good job but I‚Äôm scared by it all and now I want to have a child but I‚Äôm so scared that I will scar my child the same way I was scared ( I just wanna say that after this whole situation my mom was always around even though she worked a lot it never happened again, she met a new man they had a child and thankfully that child never had to go through my life struggles- my moms new man also gave me issue tried to kick me out ",

    "selftext": "TW: mentions of SA, not anything too graphic but necessary to understand where I‚Äôm coming from. \n\nMy ex (26M) recently broke up with me (23F) and I have finally moved on and am looking for a potential partner. We were together for 4 years and he was my first everything. We were pretty serious and looking to get engaged when he realized his commitment issues and decided to end things. \n\nI have heard from those around me that ‚Äòrebound relationships‚Äô tend to be less committal and that I should just try to have fun at this time. I am inclined to agree. I figure I might enjoy a casual hookup or even just trying to ‚Äòget back out there‚Äô so to speak. I think it will help boost my confidence and ease me into greater self esteem. I consider myself pretty high strung and awkward. I fantasize a lot about initiating a kiss with a guy I find attractive and other stuff along those lines, not just sexual acts mind you. I think that this is a very attainable goal and I psyche myself out of it being possible because of my own anxiety. \n\nThis brings me to what happened last night: my friends and I frequent a local goth nightclub and I love going. I love dressing up and dancing with my friends. The music is great, the people I go with are safe, we all look after each other, and I have a generally great time. We went to celebrate my upcoming birthday, and my friend was playing matchmaker since she knew that I‚Äôm looking for a good time. \n\nBut when my male friend who‚ÄîI cannot stress enough‚Äîis a safe guy who isn‚Äôt looking to pressure me into anything I don‚Äôt want to do, put his hand on my back or held my arm to speak to me over the loud music I freaked out. I felt cornered. I didn‚Äôt want to do it anymore. I felt like I was leading him on or that he would expect something from me that I couldn‚Äôt give. I felt guilt and shame and stress all at the same time. I didn‚Äôt want to do it and I felt horrible about my own valid feelings. I ended up crying in the bathroom stall before drying my eyes and dancing with my female friends the rest of the night. \n\nI‚Äôm fine dancing with female friends. They‚Äôre safe. I am bisexual so it‚Äôs not even like the safety comes from the fact that I don‚Äôt experience attraction. It has to be from what happened to me in my past. \n\n(TW for this paragraph) My stepbrother and cousin molested me when we were all young. Roughly 9-11 years old. The added bonus of the adults in my life doing almost nothing about it once they found out only added to the issue. I also grew up in a puritan evangelical Christian private school where the culture emphasized that men will always have an uncontrollable desire for women, especially when they wear ‚Äòprovocative clothing‚Äô. \n\nI found safety in avoidance: cutting my hair short, being independent in life skills, keeping from physical/casually intimate touch with men, wearing baggy clothing, etc. This quickly became a problem that settled in the back of my mind and didn‚Äôt rear its ugly head until I got in my first relationship at 19 (with my now ex). He was always patient with me. I was timid at every step of intimacy. I refused to kiss him for a very long time because the idea of it was too much. However, I think it fed a complex of his. He loved playing the savior, of helping the damsel in distress. It was noble at first but ultimately it makes me wonder if he lost attraction because I was no longer ‚Äònovel‚Äô, or he no longer had a ‚Äòchallenge‚Äô to garner intimacy from me. There was very little moments of casual intimacy. No hand holding, no kisses on the cheek when passing by, no cuddling unless I initiated. \n\nI fear that my issues with intimacy and vulnerability will haunt me no matter who I pursue. It‚Äôs not the sexual acts that I am scared of, it‚Äôs the path to get there that does. I figure that my best bet is ‚Äòmicrodosing‚Äô on physical intimacy. Lots of women I see are very casual with it. Touching a man‚Äôs arm during conversation, fixing his hair, hugging. I know these could all be considered flirtatious, but if I am interested in the man, I don‚Äôt think I would dislike the consequences. It would be solely my anxiety that is causing the upset feelings. I think part of my anxiety last night came from the fact that I didn‚Äôt have prior feelings for the guy my friend was trying to set me up with. Perhaps my mind just doesn‚Äôt like hooking up that causally, even if she knew the guy would treat me right. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice on this type of thing? How do I confront physical intimacy in a way that is constructive and doesn‚Äôt turn into another traumatic event? I have a therapist I see regularly and this will be worked on, but it does feel strange discussing partner relationship dynamics in depth with them. I‚Äôm happy to answer questions in the comments.

I was raised by a narcissistic mother in Bangladesh, and I‚Äôve faced mental abuse from her my whole life. This has left me with low confidence, serious anxiety, and mild depression. Growing up, I didn‚Äôt socialize much, and because of my mother‚Äôs controlling nature, I missed out on learning basic life skills during my boyhood and teenage years.\n\nSince moving to the UK, I‚Äôve finally started to learn things like cooking, which felt like a huge step for me. But even simple tasks can be overwhelming. For example, tying my shoes can take me a long time, and I still struggle with basic self-care. One of the biggest challenges I face is my decision-making. I often make very poor choices. Like, if I need to go from point A to C and I know I should go through B, somehow I‚Äôll end up taking a completely different path. It‚Äôs incredibly frustrating because I don‚Äôt always get to C, and it makes me feel lost.\n\nI got married recently to my amazing wife, who is the love of my life, but I wasn‚Äôt mentally mature when we tied the knot. Now that we‚Äôre building a life together, I realize I have so much to learn. I have this dream of becoming a father, but my lack of self-awareness and decision-making skills makes both my wife and me hesitant. If I can‚Äôt take responsibility now, how will I manage a child?\n\nI feel fatigued, tired, and demotivated all the time. I‚Äôve talked to a medical professional, and I was diagnosed with low folic acid and vitamin D, which they said could contribute to my headaches and fatigue. I often suffer from migraines and sinusitis, which don‚Äôt help my mental state either. I have trouble remembering important things, crucial steps in daily tasks, and it upsets my wife.

I avoid social situations as much as possible, and if there‚Äôs a group meeting, I find it hard to speak up even if I have questions.

But I‚Äôm afraid to take jobs that require physical or technical skills‚Äîlike making burgers‚Äîbecause I worry that I might mess up and get scolded or fired. The lack of self-confidence is paralyzing.\n\nI‚Äôm reaching out to see if anyone has been through something similar or has advice on how to build confidence, improve decision-making, and navigate these challenges. I really need some guidance right now.\n\n**TL;DR:** I‚Äôm struggling with anxiety, poor decision-making, and basic life skills due to a difficult upbringing with a narcissistic mother in Bangladesh. I dream of being a father, but my lack of self-awareness and responsibility makes both me and my wife hesitant. I‚Äôm desperate for advice on building confidence and improving my life.",

    "title": "I've been messed up by school and now i struggle to study things",
    "selftext": "Hello, there is a struggle in my life that i can't find info and resources on. I wasn't lucky with schools most of the time if not every time (i transferred like 4 times) i got beaten up by other kids(sorry i didn't clarify before edit) in my primary school and despised by teacher no matter how hard i tried.\n\n Then i got transferred to another school and it wasn't as bad as the previous one but i struggled to socialise with my peers, i was known as \"melancholic\" because when we were learning about 4 humors i was called that by teacher publically cause i \"cry all the time\". I was doing my best at studying once again but i was struggling a lot, especially with math. I hardly remember anything from that time other than sleepless homework-nights, my grandma's disappointed look, remarks on how lazy i am, and not being able to keep up when taking notes. I practically became an outcast in my class except for 3 people that wasn't really my main support or anything, i still didn't knew how to treat friends. I lost one after not visiting them when they were in hospital and they called me a crybaby and a coward later. I think about it a lot and what i should've done to support them..\n\nThen i joined a community of vocalists and actors in my school and i finally felt like i found my purpose. I was writing poems, practiced singing, and even performed a couple of times, i really enjoyed it! I wasn't struggling, i wasn't dragged, but guided. I thought i finally became happy, it was my life. So i started to miss classes to engage with them as much as possible, my grades fell. I wasn't appearing frequently. And then i realized that i didn't wanted to, so even if there was no reason to not appear, i would just take a walk and buy myself a snack, or if i HAD to sit through it i would draw in my notebook or sleep. My mom wasn't happy. Teachers wasn't happy. They told me that i \"don't try hard enough\" and i felt really guilty for it, but i just knew that i couldn't take it anymore. Studying made me feel mentally and physically sick.\n\nBut then mom transferred me another school to \"make it easier for me\" and i lost it all. I lost my community, i stopped practicing my singing, i was once again at the point where i was bullied and there was no place to escape. A guy kept sneaking behind me on free time and scaring me when i tried to focus on my doodles. Every time. I tried to tell the teacher but all they said is \"you won't see them again in a couple of years\". So i tried to study again, but i was already suffering from a burnout and was far behind with every subject except english, and i fell off again. By that time i started to experience symptoms of derealization and suicidal thoughts. When i received a grade from a test and it was below avarge i felt like the most worthless thing in thee world and later that day made suicide attempt by going to the bridge above the rails with the intention of throwing myself off, but i couldn't do it. And also some guy was passing by and he told me that \"it's a teen's thing, it'll get better with time\" . So i believed him, because i really wanted to. When i told my mom about it she was like \"you know how much your fingers would've hurt burning? These wires are under high voltage. And we would be sad if something would happen to you\" i already developed some kind of fear towards her but after that i stopped trusting her completely, cause it implied that i had to go through all this because of someone else.\n\nThen covid came. Best time of my life personally because there were temporarily no school. It became a bit easier to google stuff for homework, and i also spent a lot of time online (it's not like i didn't before which contributed to missing out, it just got extreme)\n\nthen school shut down, i got transferred again, and now it's my last year and i can't even appear in most of the classes on zoom-meetings anymore, everything about it hurts. Listening to things i don't understand, teachers asking me things i don't understand, them occasionally saying \"but you're not dumb you're just pretending\" or \"lazy\" or something.\n\nI have social anxiety, i struggle with basic things like shopping and i can't count on a basic level. I keep looking for ways to make money with skills that i have with minimum human interaction (not successful) i can't be consistent with my art projects and keep scolding myself for it cause i don't know what i'm going to do after i graduate from school and i \"need to be successful now\". My mom agreed to pick me a therapist one time before, we established that i most likely have autism and adhd although this whole neurodivergence thing isn't well-known in my country and my mom knew but didn't get me a diagnosis when i was little because by law it isn't \"adult diseases\" which means it doesn't apply to you once you grow up and not only it won't be useful but it would've made things complicated for me in the future as she says. That therapist also told me stuff like \"it's not your fault it happened\" which made me feel a bit better but not too much, they kept encouraging me to decide on university and i had to take a break cus i started to feel sick again just from hearing it. I struggle to learn any new skill because i feel the pressure of getting good and fast but i can't keep myself consistent at all, every time i try to find a coach or maybe look for courses with useful info i get tired quickly and miss out or forget everything before i could recover. I'm terrified of the idea of finding a job or going to university cause i'm scared that i'll have to force myself to keep up every day whatever i like it or not (although \"like\" isn't exactly a right word, i just can't.) And even if i'll find something i like, i'll get tired again (my mom sended me to a music school one time so i could practice my singing more but i quickly got tired and the teacher kept asking me to learn 2 more instruments, so i quit. My mom kept reminding me of that like \"you're going to play with it for a bit and then abandon like that time?\" She then admitted that she was wrong for comparing it with anything but it seems like the scar remains) And i won't be able to rest. I want to find a ways to heal and enjoy my hobbies more than i currently am but every time i try to tell someone about this whole thing they keep saying that i just need to revisit the school program and get good. Is there any ways to cope with this and soothe the anxiety at least?\n\n(Also sorry for so much unpolished text, english isn't my first language but i hope you got the point)",

What methods and modalities have you tried or are currently using?\n\nIn my experience, our own compassion is the most powerful healing force there is. About 2 years ago I came across a method/healing modality called The Compassion Key¬Æ which focuses on self-directed compassion. I was skeptical at first, but I tried it, and I must say, it's the first and only modality I've come across that has helped me to heal my trauma at the root and work toward towards a life of emotional freedom. It is a very powerful tool to add to your trauma healing toolbox, I'm speaking from direct experience. I work with it everyday and my life is so much better as a result.\n\nI was so invigorated and excited about my discovery of healing using self-directed compassion that I decided to become a certified practitioner.

    "selftext": "What do I do?\n\nHello there!! I don‚Äôt want to say or give away my name as I want to remain anonymous for now. When I turn 18 I will definitely update! These are my notes over the course of a year and a half. I would like to preface, I AM CURRENTLY 14 I STARTED THIS AT 13. The white blurs are my siblings names. ‚ÄúGiving her a break with my little brother.‚Äù Is the blurred name meaning. So, I‚Äôm a 14 year old child. Never have I ever felt good in my home. My mother screamed a lot when I was younger. We would be whooped with belts, extension cords, shoes, tree branches and basically anything she had in her reach. Now.\n\n I love my dad. He is my favorite person ever. Although he wasn‚Äôt there physically for like the first half of my life he was still a cool person when I did see him on birthdays n other holidays. One time my siblings and I stayed with him for an entire summer in 2017 in Florida! It was fun! There were some bumps but it was cool. Anyways, my dad got married to a woman when I was younger (I have absolutely horrible memory so I don‚Äôt remember most of my younger days except for significant events!!) and they moved to Florida with her 3 kids (she has 6 kids). \n\nOne of her kids who is 5 years older than me SA‚Äôd me. If you‚Äôd do the math he‚Äôs currently 19!! He was 18 when he first did. I was 13/12 his birthday is before mine. To be clear My father and his at the time wife moved back to Al (where I live). They had moved around 4 times and settled at a home 45 minutes away from my home. Not trying to bore you with this info but that‚Äôs what I mean in the ss by ‚ÄúSituation‚Äù. To anyone wondering about how I got SA‚Äôd well I have 4 biological siblings (all male) and we would like to visit my father and his wife‚Äôs kids often on the weekends. At first I would sleep in the living room and not in his room. I‚Äôm goin to nick name people since I‚Äôm the only girl and saying ‚Äòhe‚Äô would get confusing.\n\n My oldest brother (currently 19) will be Craig, my second oldest (currently 16) will be Nick, middle child (currently 15 turning 16 next week) will be Charlie, and my youngest brother (4 currently) will be Zack. The person who SA‚Äôd me will be Jake.\n\nNick and I would sleep in the living room while Craig and Charlie would sleep in Jake‚Äôs room (Nick and I hate closed spaces so we sleep in open ones). As I‚Äôve stated I have horrible memory so I have no clue the exact days these events have happened. For some odd reason my fathers ex wife (yes they got divorced I‚Äôll explain in a bit.) closed off the living room so Nick and I couldn‚Äôt sleep in there anymore, leaving us to sleep in Jake‚Äôs room. Now imagine 5 kids in one room. Now I‚Äôm comfy with my bloods so I‚Äôve never really had an issue sleeping in the same space with them (I used to have bad nightmares and slept in the same room as Charlie and Craig as they shared a room).\n\nNick doesnt live with me. He‚Äôs my fathers child not my mothers therefore he lives with his mom. Nicks mom nor my mom married my father. Craig and Charlie shared a room before we moved into a new home. I would often sleep in between their beds because I would watch scary stuff with my mom and get scared therefore leading me to stay in their room. When Charlie, Craig and I stay and Nicks moms home we slept in the living room where it was cold.\n\nBack to the SA‚Ä¶ Jake‚Äôs mother closed off the living room so Nick and I couldn‚Äôt sleep in there, forcing us to sleep in Jake‚Äôs room any time we would want to go there. The my bloods slept every one the floor while leaving me to sleep in the bed with Jake. I was a child and knew no better cause I thought of him like a blood brother. He would text me 24/7 on discord (no longer have the texts will tell why later) therefore leading me to get comfy with him as a brother. One night I woke up while I was staying over cause I felt weird. He wasn‚Äôt touching me at first but my bra was moved off my right side leaving me to believe he was. Now I‚Äôm a quiet girl. Always have been always will be. I WAS SCARED when I felt his hand slide into my pants. But I pretended to be sleep because I didn‚Äôt know wtf to do. Scream? Cry? Tell? I was 12‚Ä¶I was scared and I rarely spoke. I didn‚Äôt know what to do!! So I stayed quiet and hoped he would quit. After a while he did. I went to sleep after what felt like hours and woke up, not saying a word as I was afraid no one would believe me.\n\nThis happened 4 more times. He pretended like nothing ever happened so I just thought my imagination was playing tricks on me. You may be wondering ‚Äòhow do you know it really happened then?‚Äô The last time I remember he pinched my nipple and it hurt. Dreams don‚Äôt hurt. The last time he actually physically touched my privates was a year and a half ago I think. The last time he attempted to touch me but was unsuccessful was a few days after thanksgiving. I remember that because we were at my granny‚Äôs house and I had slept in my church clothes after church and I had stockings on, stockings slowly ride down and the crotch area was lower than it was supposed to be so he was basically rubbing that area thinking it was my crotch. \n\nI don‚Äôt understand why my memory is so foggy‚Ä¶which is why I began writing notes when I felt wronged. I don‚Äôt remember years of my life. My mom thinks I‚Äôm fine. My dad thinks it‚Äôs selective memory. Over the years my family (except for my dad) called me a ‚Äòhypochondriac‚Äô which I never was. They thought I constantly overreacted cause I‚Äôm the only girl. Were my feelings not valid? I dunno but I just feel weird‚Ä¶ my mom sucks. I don‚Äôt like her one bit. Some of the notes may just be overreacting‚Ä¶ \n\nI‚Äôve always struggled with my body image. I remember being 7 and my dads side of the family calling me ‚Äòskinny‚Äô constantly which made me want to eat more cause I didn‚Äôt want to be known as the ‚Äòskinny‚Äô girl. I was 73 pounds. I dunno why I remember that day but I used to weigh myself a lot. In 7 years I‚Äôve obviously gained weight. My metabolism used to be fast. I would eat and it would go away rather quickly! After Covid that all went to shit. Apparently I got ‚Äòlazy‚Äô as my mother would say and would stay in doors constantly. I was scared to get sick so I would stay indoors. School was closed so no more fitness stuff for me. I‚Äôve always been smart. After getting on TikTok at the age of 9/10 I would slowly realize that what my mom would do wasn‚Äôt normal. People were treated better. People didn‚Äôt get scared when their mother would come in their room. People wouldn‚Äôt get scared when they ate too much. People could talk to their moms 24/7. I‚Äôve always wondered why I couldn‚Äôt. I still wonder why I can‚Äôt. Not as much though. I‚Äôm scared of her. Extremely scared of her. I‚Äôm constantly walking on eggshells around her. She is the reason I have anxiety.\n\nTeen depression doesn‚Äôt get talked about enough. I‚Äôm not sure it was depression‚Ä¶I was just constantly upset, never had any reason to get up, never really wanted to do anything, ate too much and too less, slept constantly, and more. I was called lazy 24/7 I‚Äôm not sure if I was being lazy or not. But eating Cinnamon Toast Crunch everyday all day is worrying right? Like I wouldn‚Äôt eat meals anymore. I would pour CTC in a napkin everyday and eat them while watching yt. My only sense of comfort was my gacha videos. It was comforting because there were other people like me and they liked my content.\n\nMost of the notes speak for themselves. I‚Äôve been living for 14 years. Do I want to be living anymore? NO!! Do I continue to live cause I don‚Äôt want it disappoint my dad? Yes. I constantly wished I was never born. I‚Äôve thought about cutting myself but didn‚Äôt cause I was scared. I‚Äôve thought about suicide multiple times. I‚Äôve wrote in multiple notebooks for years about harming myself but could never go through with it. I‚Äôm scared to live. This economy is scary. Men are scary. Life is scary. I‚Äôm 14 I don‚Äôt want it fucking feel like this. Feeling like this sucks. Living like this sucks. I want to be able to own my own body with men telling me about it. I was an early bloomer. Everything came early. I‚Äôve been groped by classmates. All guys. I thought if I told I‚Äôd be ridiculed for what I wear. I wear hoodies and jeans constantly to try and cover up. I‚Äôm scared. My mom won‚Äôt let me do online school. I‚Äôm fucking scared. Will they hurt me if I tell?? Idk. I don‚Äôt like growing up fast. I wish I was younger. I wish I could still play with my Barbie‚Äôs without being told I‚Äôm too old. I wish I could still playing with dolls and baby alives.\n\nHaving anxiety is shit. I know I have it. I used to cry constantly because I would have to say speeches in front of the church. I had no choice but to please my family. My mom won‚Äôt let me get it taken care of. I‚Äôm constantly scared or worried something is gonna happen to me. I‚Äôve quit going to the church my granny goes to. They‚Äôre all weird. Don‚Äôt like anyone there. I wanna learn about the lord in peace. That church isn‚Äôt peace. What do I do when I want to die constantly?? What do I do when my parents won‚Äôt listen?? Am I still seeking attention?? I never was. Why would I want attention?? I just want my story to be known I don‚Äôt want to be known. Just my story. Life is shit. Mom is shit. Pretending to be happy is working though!! I‚Äôm glad they can‚Äôt see through me and my emotions. I‚Äôve learned to stop crying so much cause they constantly called me a crybaby. Please tell me what I can do without my parents knowing!! Please help me find an out. I‚Äôm scared that they‚Äôd not believe me.\n\nI‚Äôm sorry if I went off the rails!! I have no one to really talk to. Jake was my safe space but he ruined me. Idk what to do will someone please help?",

    "selftext": "So confused for writing this here but I really want to share this with someone who could simply listen without judging me.\n\nThis is about an incident (actually a nightmare) which happened with me 4 Years back. I know some of you must be thinking that why am I bringing this now but that's the whole issue.. I am not able to let it go and I am finding it hard to forget this. This haunting incident brings back those flash backs which I never want to remember.\n\nSo it happened when I was with the love of my life. He was living near by in a flat and I was living with my mother and siblings hardly 1km away from his apartment. Since both of us were living close to eachother so I used to stay back with him on weekends or other holidays.\n\nBoth of our families were also aware about it and my mother and siblings also used to visit his place and we all used to enjoy our weekend together.\n\nIt was a happy space for me as well were about to get engaged soon.\n\nSo once I was there at his place and we both had an argument. Now the thing that has to be noticed here is that the society he was living in was under construction so this particular tower in which he was residing was at the outer area of that society and was little far away from the other towers of that society. And he was the only person living in that tower with no neighbours.\n\nSo coming back to the argument we had that evening which happened in the hall of that flat and somehow it was heard by few ladies who was there for an evening walk.\n\nFew minutes later our door bell rang and my (special) friend chose to open it. As soon as he opened it there entered two aunties with the society guards and started enquiring about the argument happening. I was in the washroom and after hearing all that I came out and told them that nothing happened and everything is ok. They left after enquiring few things as if they were really concerned about me.\n\nNow after they all were gone I was quite irritated with their arrival at my flat but my friend somehow tries to explain me that they were there for my safety which is a good thing to notice. After that I went to my mother's place and came back 2-3 days later. So now I was walking and just behind me I heard few ladies talking about me and out then one said pointing out at me : 'she is the one who got hit that night - yahi hai jo iss din maar kha rahi thi ek ladke se' and they started mocking me .. after hearing this I couldn't stop myself from asking them what they were saying and why so I stopped them and asked that ' aunty aap kya bol rahe ho,maine apko bataya tha k kya hua tha phir aap ese sab baate kyu kar rhe ho? - aunty what did you say? I have told you what happened that day then why are you talking like that about me?\n\nLiterally these were my words and after that one of them were like 'no no, we were not saying anything (this lady was not present that evening at my flat along with the other two)\n\nAnd then the other two started saying that yes we are saying the truth that you got beaten up by that boy living with you and girls like you are shameless. The moment they started this I got irritated and with that irritation I said that I don't want to argue with them and I am not free to look into others life and after that I just turned back to go to my place. But as soon as I turned back they stopped me and started abusing me, my family, my parents, my friend and my upbringing. I asked them to stop and told them that whatever they were saying was wrong and they should think of me as someone's daughter, sister. I also asked them that what if someone abuses their children like this? Will they accept it? Just after hearing this one of the lady came towards me and strangulated me after which I was fallen on the ground and seeing this many other ladies got gathered there who were witnessing this but literally nobody stopped them. (I tried to record that with my phone but those ladies snatched my phone and tried to break it by throwing it on the ground multiple times.)\nInfact when I stopped up after that I questioned those ladies witnessing it for being shut and in return I got a reply that 'don't try to act like you are shooting for a Savdhan India episode. Nothing has happened to you, you are alive'\n\nAfter this all those ladies went away and when i informed my mother about this incident she suddenly came to that place and decided to confront those people and also to file a police complaint but as soon as she and my friend went to talk to them, there husbands and several other people started slut shaming me and started raising questions on me. Not only this .. there were few other ladies who on daily basis started following me and my friend as soon as we step out of our flat. They used to tell us to not to take any legal actions against what happened with me which was again very haunting.\n\nWell I was so disturbed after this incident that I decided to leave that place and didn't take any action against them. But today also this incident make me question several things. I feel weak for not taking action against it which literally pushes me in a mental state of thinking about this whole day.. amd getting disturbed mentally.\n\nWell was I right or wrong for being quiet?\n\nI Still think that I didn't do anything wrong with anyone that this happened with me.",

I figured it would be helpful for others to explore, as it seems to be such a consistent inquiry.

    "title": "Seeking advice for long term light sleep issues",
    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm hoping to get some advice or insight from those who have dealt with long-term sleep issues or insomnia. Here's my story:\n\nI'm a male in my mid-30s, and about five years ago, I first started developing sleep problems. It began during a period of stress while looking for a new job, and since then, my sleep has gotten progressively lighter and lighter. It‚Äôs reached the point where I can‚Äôt seem to fall asleep without taking low-dose amitriptyline at night (now I'm on mirtazapine). My sleep now feels very shallow, and I wake up frequently throughout the night, often exhausted in the morning.\n\nThe main thing I struggle with is getting into deeper stages of sleep. I often feel like I've got palpitations and tension in my chest. My mind tends to whirr a lot, and although I don‚Äôt really have nightmares, I do experience a lot of vivid dreaming and frequent awakenings. It's like my body is hypervigilant and just can't fully relax and refuses to let go.\n\nHere's a bit more about my situation:\n\n* **Exercise**: I work out 4 days a week, am fit and well but the lack of quality sleep is really impacting my progress in the gym.\n* **Evening Routine**: I've been strict about this for periods and then I haven't been as I haven‚Äôt fully convinced myself of its benefit. That said, I‚Äôve tried several different things like journaling before bed, body scans, and self-havening, but nothing has really made a big difference so far. I know consistency might be key here, so I'm trying to figure that out. Body scans before bed do not help tbh and may make things worse.\n* **Therapy**: Over the years, I‚Äôve seen a therapist and tried CBT, hypnotherapy, and somatic experiencing. More recently, I‚Äôve been experimenting with using ChatGPT to guide me through somatic healing, and I‚Äôve had some success discharging trauma. I‚Äôve tapped into some deeper emotions during pendulation and heart-centered meditations.  \n* **Breathwork**: One thing that has helped is activating breathwork, like somatic breathwork with rounds of intense inhales followed by breath holds. It seems to release some stuck energy and helps me find stillness, but it‚Äôs not enough to fix my overall sleep quality.\n* **Supplements**: I‚Äôve tried various supplements like ashwagandha, magnesium, and mirtazapine, but I‚Äôm not sure if they‚Äôve made any significant difference. I don‚Äôt drink caffeine in the afternoons.\n\nDespite all this, I still wake up exhausted most mornings, and it‚Äôs frustrating because I feel like I‚Äôm doing a lot but not seeing the recovery I need. During the day, I function relatively well, but I know I‚Äôm not getting the deep sleep necessary to properly recover.\n\nI‚Äôm looking for any advice, tips, or experiences from those who‚Äôve dealt with something similar. Whether it‚Äôs changes in routines, supplements, therapies, or something else entirely, I‚Äôm open to trying new things.\n\nThanks in advance for any help you can provide!",

    "selftext": "TW: DV and self harm.\nI need advice. I'll try keep the history short. I left my abusive husband 5 years ago. I experienced verbal, financial, physical and sexual abuse at his hands. I left with our two young kids when he choked me infront of them. Since then I've been trying to rebuild my life with the kids whilst fighting him in court and trying to keep my location secret because he told me he'd unalive us all if he found us.\n\nI met my current partner very soon after leaving (completely unplanned, but the universe had other plans) and he has been a huge component of my healing journey.\n\nThe problem is I have developed co-dependency with him. I need him to help me emotionally regulate and solve simple problems. If he is upset or angry (at anyone) I immediately go to pieces. I cannot handle any negative feedback from him and end up feeling like the worst person in the world because I did something to hurt  or upset him. Invariably I go to pieces and he has to put down anything he feels to care for my emotions. And when I say gets upset or angry I mean he calmly tells me if I've done something to upset him and wants to find a solution. \n\nRecently I have been trying to be more self aware and introspective. I've realised things about myself which I do not like, and my mental health has declined a lot. I've been depressed, and any time any negative feedback is given to me by him I go in to self loathing and a panic attack and self harm.\n\nLater on when I'm calmed down, I am full of guilt and shame and hate myself for how I treat him, and myself. I know he no longer wants to share any emotions like hurt or anger with me because he's scared I'll hurt myself.\n\nI don't want to be like this. I have built such a good life with an amazing, kind and patient man. But once I feel my trauma triggered and fight or flight kicks in then I lose control. I feel like I've turned into the abuser. I'm so scared, and I want to learn to be a person I can respect.\n\nSo how do people learn to self-regulate their emotions through trauma response? How do I even begin to build a self esteem so I don't immediately fall into self hatred and harm? I feel so lost and scared. I know I need to work this out without him doing it for me and I don't know where to start. I dont even know if I'm strong enough. Any advice would be so appreciated, thank you.",

    "selftext": "TW:SA /date-SA (is that the right term?)\n\nI just went through something really strange and difficult that I don‚Äôt recall ever happening before.  My husband and I are in therapy.  We had a pretty vulnerable session and were talking very openly with each other on the way home.  One of the topics that came up was how our sex drives don‚Äôt match up and how I don‚Äôt want to have sex nearly as much as he does and how conflicting that is for him.  It‚Äôs a difficult topic for me to talk about and usually ends up in me saying ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt talk about this anymore‚Äù or getting mad that we‚Äôre even discussing it.  When we got home we were talking in the car, and I think because we had been so open already, I somehow missed the point where I usually stop the conversation, so I just let him continue on about how he has needs and he wants us to both have desire for each other.  During this time I froze up and started to zone out, hearing him but not really listening fully.  I started to feel more and more  tense and frozen.  I could feel my eyes get wide and I started to inch closer to my car door.  Finally I said ‚ÄúI need to get out of the car.  We need to end this conversation right now.  And I quickly got out of the car, closed the door and just stood there leaning against the car, frozen in place, unable to move at all or speak for about 5 whole minutes at least.  He stood there looking at me and asking if I was ok but I couldn‚Äôt answer.  I just stared at an imaginary spot on the ground.  Finally I snapped out of it and was able to look up at him and try to speak.  \n\n(Heres the trigger part) I explained to him in stuttering sentences how being in the car, having that conversation and feeling pressure to have sex, even though we were just talking about it and he was actually being very straightforward, kind, and not pressuring me, took me back to the night when I was 16 on a date in the back of a car, being physically pressured to do more than I was willing to do.  I actually felt that same feeling of fear and anxiety as I did that night.  \n\nHow the hell am I going to ever be able to communicate about this topic and move on so that I can actually be comfort having sex with my husband again, if it comes back to haunt me like this?!  This is the worst I‚Äôve experienced it so far in front of him.  But I frequently will have thoughts of that night plus several other instances come back in my head.  Sometimes it‚Äôs right after my husband and I have sex.  Sometimes it‚Äôs just when you he topic comes up.  But for some reason, these events that I‚Äôve had buried for years are now coming back up and I can‚Äôt get them to stop jumping into my head.  \n\nTL/DR:  I can‚Äôt even talk about intimacy without it bringing up old memories and scary feelings.  How do I stop this from happening?",

Nothing seemed off til I told them I‚Äôm leaving the city in a couple of days to head back home. \n\n  Normally it‚Äôs a group of people going and drinking but this time it was only one person and me. I should also mention the group of people are at the card shop still and were planning to go drink after like normal.

    "title": "How Can I Fix This",
    "selftext": "I just need to share this with the world. I come from a family of five. I have two sisters and a mom and dad. My older sister was born to another mother and has always felt separate from my younger sister and I. She‚Äôs lived far away from us for the majority of her life. At one point, she did come and live with us, though. I remember this vaguely since I was just a small child, but she quickly moved back away from us even though she didn‚Äôt have much to go back to- her mother was a drug addict and physically abused her. What pushed her away from us was a combination of multiple things. My father wasn‚Äôt there for her growing up and had started a new life and new family without her, one which she never felt like she was a part of. My mother really nitpicked and nagged her about everything, and- not really being her actual mother-, this really drove a wedge between them. My father says that she said a lot of things that she never should have, but I have no knowledge of what these things were. He always refused to share. I never really thought about it until now, but I think this foreshadowed what would become of my little sister‚Äôs and mother‚Äôs relationship. My father always tried to make things right with my older sister but there‚Äôs always been an unbreakable distance between them, understandably so.\n\n\nAt the beginning of middle school, I was thrown into a fundamentalist non-denominational private school, where I was taught a bunch of conspiracy theories and flat-out lies, including but not limited to biblical literalist, young-earth creationism, the Illuminati and the New World Order, chemtrails, and anti-politician lizard-people-type rhetoric. I was taught that women were subservient to men and that black people were cursed by God in the Bible and that this would be the reason that trans-Atlantic slavery transpired. Almost everything fun or mind-enriching was evil, including but limited to Pokemon, yoga, video games, etc. You get the point. I could not use social media. I wasn‚Äôt allowed to have friends who weren‚Äôt Christian or came from outside of the church even though I did. I did, however, push many of them away in this era of my life. I became a zealous and religious student. We were taught apologetics and how to turn atheists and ‚Äúevolutionists‚Äù into God-fearing men and women. I studied hard year-in and year-out at this school. I wanted to become a pastor or a missionary. I wanted to go to college as it were to teach all the godless sinners there how they were being brainwashed by this educational factory system of lies that was rigged against them. Sometimes, I got four hours of sleep just so I could study all this garbage amongst other actually important subjects. My parents let this go on- especially my father-, because they fully agreed with it and egged it on. When my family ran out of the money to continue to pay for my schooling here- thank God-, they told me I would have to transfer. At this point, the church ‚Äúfamily‚Äù turned on me and said that I was going out into the world to live out my sinnish fantasies. I was ignored by the people who were formerly my friends the year this happened. We never went back to this church. I continued to believe their ideology whole-heartedly all the way to the end of high school, though. And big part of this ideology was filial piety, honoring one‚Äôs elders, and turning the other cheek. I wove this ideology into my family life.\n\nFrom a young age, my mother used to say that I was her favorite child and that she disliked my little sister. I can‚Äôt even tell you how many times I heard this sentiment. And she made this very clear to my little sister. She constantly picked on her. Her clothing, her friends, her social media use, her grades, her not fulfilling certain chore obligations. See, my sister chose a different life than me. She had to go to church camps and Sunday school, but she never wanted to go to the same church school I did. I think this was because she saw what it had done to me. And she was smart and chose to not touch it with a nine and a half foot pole. She remained Christian, but not the kind of Christian I was. I believed that as the older brother and as the more ‚Äúsaintly‚Äù one, I had to lead by example and do everything my parents and social superiors asked of me without so much as a complaint. I was praised for this, and my sister began to revile me for it. I always turned the other cheek. This angered her more, I think. I didn‚Äôt realize that I was alienating my sister and making my mom hate her more. On top of this, my mother only punched down at her more verbally. At one point, she began completely ignoring me. It felt like we were so far removed from each other that we didn‚Äôt even have siblings. We lived right down the hall from each other wouldn‚Äôt speak but a few words to each other in a week maybe. As time went on, things got better between us. But the same cannot be said for my mother and sister‚Äôs relationship. \n\nThis would progressively worsen throughout my sister‚Äôs high school and now college years to the point where they completely ignore each other when they‚Äôre in each other‚Äôs company and my sister does everything in her power to not be away from home for as long as possible when she‚Äôs in town. My mom badgers her with the most pesky questions about her friends and love interests that it‚Äôs almost like childlike teasing. But it‚Äôs so persistent and ongoing that isn‚Äôt something to take lightly. She‚Äôs extremely nosy and likes to dig up every detail she can about the both of us and she gossips about it with everyone. She often shares deeply intimate details about our lives without our approval. But she isn‚Äôt just nosy with us- even though we bear the brunt of it. She creeps her way into everyone‚Äôs lives and at one point her knowledge of other people and the people they know becomes toxicly parasocial. She feeds on the drama and narrative of other people‚Äôs lives without really building her own and then spreads that information to everybody without regard for how others feel about it. And she always has this fake, hollow veneer on around everybody outside of our nuclear family. She puts on a mask and tries to present us as the perfect family even though it‚Äôs been falling apart for some time now.\n\nI came out as an atheist to my mom first. She told me to never tell my dad because he‚Äôd disown me and put me out on the streets and ‚Äúwho knows what.‚Äù My dad was always the more religious one and given our background, i believed her but once i finally ended up confessing this to my father i realized this was never true. We had a heated discussion but he actually respected me more for being honest with him. My mom always said that we treated our dad as our favorite parent. Which is ironic given her overwhelming partiality between my sister and i. She threw a ton of hissy fits about this when we were younger. Looking back, I think she wanted to drive a wedge between my dad and i to put distance between in a relationship she envied and bringing me closer to her. Which kinda worked at the time.\n\nMy mom used to always tell me from a young age that I was going to get a well-paying job and take good care of her. She‚Äôs said this around family members and bragged about it even though the fruits of this are yet to be seen. When I tried to enter an artistic career path, she told me that this was a terrible idea and that I needed to find an actual career. And while I didn‚Äôt go down that road and my art remains a side-hobby, it‚Äôs always stuck with me that she‚Äôs always viewed me as a form of security for her in old age and that maybe the only reason she‚Äôs parented me at all was so she could be comfortable throughout her lifetime. She‚Äôs also said and done a lot that leads me to believe she only views my father as a wallet and that there isn‚Äôt really any love between them anymore. Even my father has confided that he feels this way to me. My point in saying this is that she only views her family as a resource to be tapped and not as a form of kinship. I think my mom is deeply traditional at her core, and she views men as providers. I believe this may be part of the reason she doesn‚Äôt like my sister. She doesn‚Äôt have anything to offer her materially as another woman from her POV. \n\nI‚Äôve hated birthdays for a long time now. They always draw so much drama from my mother. When we celebrate her birthday, our gestures and presents are never enough. She‚Äôs never happy. We took her to France and Mexico on two separate occasions for her birthday and she threw a temper tantrum both times that we didn‚Äôt get her a card even though we took her out to dinner and treated her and really just gave her everything. The cards need to be handmade as well, or else they aren‚Äôt as meaningful to her. I remember one year I gave her a weekend long celebration for her birthday, taking her to a steakhouse, making her a nice homecooked meal, a card, giving her a nice gift, and she still complained that my sister didn‚Äôt do anything for her when she was in an entire other city for college. Mind you, she called and sent a card and took her out for dinner when she was in town weeks later, but my mom balled and sobbed and got angry that she didn‚Äôt do enough. And it‚Äôs like this every year for Mother‚Äôs Day, Christmas, and her birthday. My father, sister, and I never complain about what we get or whether or how we‚Äôre celebrated, though. We just dread holidays and birthdays now.\n\nShe‚Äôs been out of work for a little over a year now, and she doesn‚Äôt want to find another job. She wants to retire in her early sixties even though there‚Äôs nothing physically wrong with her. Truth is, she hasn‚Äôt really had to work much at all over the course of her life, though. She‚Äôs mainly depended on my dad to provide. My mom retiring early would force my dad to never retire, though, since his income would be entirely dedicated to letting my mom essentially sit at home and do nothing all day. Because we really don‚Äôt have that kind of money. But she always wants to live above our means and get new and fancy houses and cars that we can‚Äôt afford. We‚Äôve reined her spending in recently, but she‚Äôs always dissatisfied with what she has. She spends most of her day watching the news, shows, and scrolling through social media. And I swear, that‚Äôs all she does. She lives to be angry at Donald Trump. She fulminates about the newest crazy things he‚Äôs said or done and has for the better part of eight years almost everyday. It‚Äôs draining. She rarely tries to make an effort to forge a relationship with her children or husband at all. Shes gotten noticeably tipsy or even drunk every night by her lonesome and has for as long as I can remember. She‚Äôs the epitome of a wino mom. And it‚Äôs begun to take a toll on her memory and cognitive function. She constantly forgets what she‚Äôs saying. It‚Äôs even become dangerous for her to be on the road. Recently, she was headed to a concert with my aunts and sister and she just stopped in the middle of the freeway for no reason because she forgot where she was going. She constantly lies now about little embarrassing things in her life because she‚Äôs afraid that we‚Äôre going to make fun of her, even though we never have. We‚Äôre often just angry that she‚Äôs lying so much and we catch her in it all the time. Things have gotten so bad that my dad‚Äôs considering divorce. She‚Äôs been confronted about her behaviors so many times and refused to change.",

    "selftext": "This is going to sound stupid asf but let me explain. When I was young, I had a *\"meckel's diverticulum band\"* that would cause me immense stomach pain until I was 8 years old, when the doctors found it and removed it. It was some of the scariest moments of my life. Anyway, a couple of months ago I was listening to Wendigoon and a few autoplays later the *12 Man Tapes FNAF* video came up. If you haven't seen it, it's possibly the darkest interpretation of the FNAF universe. I was like \"Whatever I sat through ASF, Martyrs, Salo, Terrifier, etc\" and usually while it disturbs me, I'm over it quickly. This time was not the case. In this interpretation, William killed some kids by poisoning them with tapeworms and putting the eggs into the pizza. Creepy, but interesting. Then, it cuts to *\\*very\\** realistic hospital found-footage. The boy at hand is 7-year-old Eric. You hear his mother hysterical as they rush him into the ER, and the doctors describe his symptoms. Vomiting blood, constipation, immense stomach pain, etc. Creeped me out, and took me back to being in the hospital at 8. Then it goes from 0 to **100**. The boy wakes up mid-operation as the CT scans show images of the worms eating his liver. His screams of pain were far too real, and the words the nurse uses to comfort little Eric are almost the exact words I remember my mom telling me before I went into surgery. It ends with Eric dying and the doctors and mom crying. That day I kept replaying the scene. It unlocked memories of that time. And to imagine that pain inflicted on him was INTENTIONAL, when mine was just a medical rarity, disturbed me even more. I don't know if this makes sense, but can anyone help me get over this? This is the only horror content I've watched that actually has made me lose sleep and feel depressed at times. I can't get Eric's screams out of my head, nor the nurse saying \"The doctor will take the pain away okay?\" right before he flatlines. It was too realistic. Like seriously someone should look into how tf he made that shit. I can't stop thinking about it. I would link the video but I don't want to even look it up again. I guess this trauma stems more from my experience, and this video just reopened the closed wound, but either way, does anyone have advice?",

We split because, per his words and what lies he fed to our mutual friends:\"she's a crazy piece of crap who doesnt care about me\"\n\nWhen we started dating. He made it very clear that he likes my breasts(they are pretty large for someone in our region) and even on our first date, he put his hands on my breasts and grabbed them so hard it hurt while we were on the bus, in full public view. I walked away and told him off on it. He responded that he just wanted to feel real boobs so he did it. \n\nA few weeks later, on a train, he stood in front of me while i was seated and put his hand up my skirt while his other hand tried to undo my bra. I yelled loudly and he pushed himself on me, saying its my fault he's hard now and he proceeded to rub his thing on me when we were going down the escalator. \n\nThis kept going on even despite me telling him im not comfortable. It evantually escalated to a point where every date, he would try to ask me to go to a hotel with him so he could \"feel up my breasts to relieve his needs\". I told him off many times on this and that i wasnt comfortable, he even booked a hotel for my birthday and insisted i look happy he was going to make me \"feel good\". He stopped having patience since then and would drag me to dark corners of shopping malls to feel up my privates, sometimes even abuse me by making my breasts bruise when it was sore.\n\nI kept trying to tell him to stop or just go seek help, and it only escalated. Once, he bought a bunch of sex toys to fuel his feitish, started talking about it all day and he pushed it on me, saying i should satisfy him by wearing it in public. I refused and he grabbed me, squeezed by breasts so hard in public while trying to put the sex toy in my underwear. There were also times where my privates were very sore/painful because of my period and he would stick his leg between my privates and push it up. I would cry from the pain but all he was concerned with was how i got period blood all over his jeans.\n\nI had enough. I told him off again and I said I would tell his family what has been going on. He went on to say that he is the only one who can \"make me feel good\" \n\nAfter we broke up(he cheated btw). I thought my nightmare was over and I was able to live freely. But he started treating me like a prostitute and asked if i was willing to sleep with him or his friends for cash in exchange. I finally had it, i yelled at him over the phone while he was with his family and he called me crazy. \n\nIts been..  a couple years now and I still get nightmares from the things he did to me. It really hurt and I stopped being able to want to be in a relationship with anyone in fear they would do this to me..",

It felt as though a hand was feeling my testicles once, and it matched perfectly with the feeling I got whenever I had a testicular exam, later on.

I‚Äôve never been interested in parties and alcohol, but my new friends did so I decided I would too. They loooved gossiping and getting drunk. They also loved talking shit about other people, and creating all kinds of drama (usually related to guys/sex). I went along with it, because I wanted to be ‚Äúcool‚Äù. \n\nSometimes it was actually nice, and I held on to those moments. When the other girls would take care of me when I got too drunk, or support each other when crying over some guy. \n\nBut most of the time they sucked. They were jealous (of me, of each other, of other girls), often selfish and flaky. They would buy each other expensive birthday gifts every year, but in five years of friendship I only got a bday present ONCE (& it wasn‚Äôt that great, a bottle of whiskey which I don‚Äôt even like). \n\nI moved away after graduating, to start a. new job. They‚Äôve talked about coming to visit me for two years now, but none of them did. TWO YEARS. I‚Äôve been back to the college town to see them at least 5 times since graduating, and they barely even showed up for that‚Ä¶.‚Äùtoo hungover‚Äù ‚Äútoo depressed‚Äù every time. \n\nI only realized it a couple of days ago: they‚Äôre never going to change. And I don‚Äôt want to be friends with people like that. I feel soo stupid for not realizing earlier, I feel like I wasted five years of my life waiting for them to come around. \n\nNow I just feel empty. It‚Äôs been only a couple of days since the realization hit me, all I want to do is sleep, my head is aching and I feel betrayed. \n\nI can‚Äôt even blame them. They didn‚Äôt betray me, I betrayed myself. They showed me who they were from day 1, but I was too lonely to care. \n\nWhere do I go from here? ",

    "title": "Rather Be Homeless Than Live With My Mom Anymore",
    "selftext": "I've (16M) been thinking about leaving my house for a while now, maybe like 6 years or more. I think today is the make or break day. Yesterday in a store she saw someone walking down an isle she was going into, this person was holding a drink and talking to their friends. My mother stood in front of them and stopped, making that person bump into them, apologize, and almost drop their drink. I got super pissed at her and told her that was very very rude. She defended herself with \"she should've been watching\" and I tried to explain that that person was talking to a friend, distracted, and holding a drink, but she stood her ground. \n\nAs we went through the store she got agitated with me, and eventually told me to go away. (normal thing you can say to your kids huh? /j) and on the way home to slapped my hands away from the radio and refused to let me do anything if she could reasonably do it herself. \n\nShe forces me onto different unprescribed medications all the time from strange companies i've never heard of and don't trust and then when she doesn't get what she wants right away she forced me off them. I genuinely think it's been fucking up my brain cause she started doing this when i was 12. AFAIK 12 year old brains are not the most stable or protected against stuff like this. \n\nShe called me a total of 18 times between the hours 2:00 and 6:00 before finally waking me up with screaming at 6:30. (my phone is always on silent cause if it's not she'll take it and read my messages) She told me to shut up and screamed at me\nabout cleaning my room and the bathroom and the spare bedroom and that i don't appericate anything she does for me. This happens every 6-12 ish months in my household. I've never gotten an apology and no matter how much she said she's changed she just hasn't. She slammed the door open on my so hard i sprained my wrist and ankle.\n\nI'm scared. Because of her income I don't qualify for financial aid so I don't know how i'll pay for college or school lunch anymore if I leave. I don't know how to be homeless and not die. I don't know if i have anywhere to go. \n\nMy dad constantly teases and makes fun of me but at least he doesn't stalk me and go into my room when i'm sleeping like my mother does. I don't know how she can act like this and still have a job in the medical field taking care of people. I feel bad, cause if i do leave, im leaving my brother behind and he doesn't deserve that but as the oldest I've had to deal with this for so much longer and so much worse. (a second kid made them rethink spanking as a punshiment once he turned 6)\n\nI'd rather be homeless than deal with this anymore. I don't know what I'll do, probably nothing cause I'm always scared of everything. Coming home from school is scary and I don't want to quit my education either. I dunno, i'm just having a really rough day. ",

    "selftext": "I don't want her to see.\n\nIn order to explain this properly, I have to explain a few things about myself and our family.\n\nOur parents weren't, strictly speaking, prepared to be parents when I came along, and spent a lot of time saddled by their own personal issues (Mom's depresslon/likely bipolar/night job, Dad's anxiety/rough job/dominating parents) while having to deal with the two little humans that they brought into this world.\n\nAs a result, though we were always decently provided for and they did their best to show they loved us, they were often pretty short-tempered and Dad was frankly rude and patronizing to us, even when we were children. They would even lose their tempers and get physically abusive on rare occasions--more with me than with her.\n\nThey didn't have a lot of time or patience to really teach us how to survive outside the house, either.\n\nCouple this with the fact that were were both bullied severely from the word \"go\" all the way through middle school, with no real emotional support from the teachers or system.\n\nBecause of all this stress, I admit I was a pretty rotten brother, bullying, full of cutting remarks about her appearance...I came to regret it in high school and tried to change but it was too late.\n\nAs a result, my sister and I both sort of broke in different directions.\n\nI became depressed, anxious, and the difficulties I had expressing myself and dealing with people became greatly exaggerated. Sometimes I wonder if I might be a bit bipolar. I grew up anxious, nervous, paranoid about leaving my parents' house except to walk to my (crappy) job, mistrustful, severely depressed, lacking the self-esteem to \\[fill in the blank\\].\n\nMy issues coupled with a couple of bad incidents led to me being unable to bring myself to learn to drive. I would go into a panic just being behind the wheel. As such I never left my family home.\n\nSister, according to her psychiatrists later in life, developed Bipolar Disorder, anxiety, depression. She grew up having screaming fights with us over the smallest things. I eventually retreated into my room whenever she got like this, which didn't help because the walls are paper thin and my door didn't lock.\n\nI spent my entire life walking on eggshells around three unstable people, never sure if something I would say ordo would set them off, retreating into myself unable to trust anyone.\n\nAll my life there was been an unspoken double standard. She got to act like two cats stuck in a bag to my parents, got to do afterschool clubs without being yelled at for being an inconvenience, got to say and do things that would get¬†*me*¬†smacked in the face or yelled at.\n\nAt some point around high school, we all kind of grew up a little. My father realized how badly he'd screwed up with us and eased up. I realized how badly I'd screwed up my relationship with her. I tried to treat her better but like I said, too late.\n\nSomewhere around my 34rd birthday (2016), I began developing ALK+ lung cancer but partly due to my own depression issues I blew off the symptoms and thought it was a number of different things until over a year later in 2018 when I couldn't take the pain anymore. When I finally came in they gave me three to six months, but thanks to my awesome oncologist I've been able to live over six years. Now I'm on cancer drugs, painkillers, and mood stabilizers that leave my head a bit foggy and confused, but at least my depression has a floor to fall to.\n\nThis came just after I learned that my mother has vascular dementia. Another chip on the pile.\n\nSince then, my father and I have actually been able to rebuild our relationship. He takes care of things I'm too scatter-brained (particularly nowadays) for like my pills, and drives me places as well as cooking or buying lunch.\n\nAfter she got a graduate degree a few years back, my sister ended up with a decent-paying, slightly stressful, job (she hates) that finally allowed her to move out of the house. Then she racked up over ten thou in credit debt and her landlords jacked up her rent so she came back to live with us.\n\nI'm barely making $900 a month in disability, my sister's making twice that.\n\nWhen she was living in her own apartment, she'd visit for a few hours every day, read things that supported her political opinions loudly, and denigrate my father and I for having opposing opinions because clearly no one who disagrees with her could possibly be a good person. Dad and I would chuckle about it when she left.\n\nI think my father's broken, frankly. He lets her walk all over him and verbally beat him down and refuses to assert himself. When I try to assert myself, he gets upset because I'm not taking her condition into account.\n\nThe worst part is, 80% percent of the time she's a fundamentally good person. She cooks for us, she buys fast food for us. She brings home gifts. She has a bunch of friends she's managed to keep through high school and college. She's funny, clever, kind. I'm pretty sure the meds they have her on are doing¬†*something.*\n\nShe took me on two vacations, while my treatments were helping me recover. I'll never forget them, because she's constantly bringing them up, years later.\n\nI'm grateful for the things she does for Dad and I, but I don't want them at the cost of having to put up with her walking all over us. I never asked for anything anyway.\n\nIf she does something I don't like and I tell her, I'm being 'passive-aggressive'.\n\nShe goes on at least one incredibly expensive vacation a year in spite of being deeply in debt, but I'm 'irresponsible'.\n\nIf I express a political opinion she disagrees with I'm evil, If she expresses a view I disagree with I'm a selfish monster who wants to see children die.\n\nIf she does something for us, we're ungrateful if we don't immediately thank her. If we do something for her, we didn't do the way SHE wants and we should know better.\n\nI'm trying to sleep because my condition and my drugs make me tired? \"I don't HAVE an inside voice! You KNOW that!\"\n\nIf I post a joke on her timeline, I'm trying to EMBARRASS her!\n\nIf she loses her temper and says mean things it's because she's under a lot of stress and has a mental condition, But¬†*clearly*¬†I'm not in the same boat, right? So if I lose my temper and say mean things--No, if I so much as express an¬†*opposing opinion to hers*, I'm being unreasonable, hateful, patronizing, ungrateful again. She's NEVER been ANYTHING but kind and considerate toward ME, right?\n\nI've apologized for the way I treated her when we were kids over and over but she's decided that I'm not sorry, so I guess I'm not. After all, she can read minds and knows exactly what I'm thinking and all my motivations.\n\nShe has no self-awareness. She accuses me of things she allows herself to do freely, she contradicts herself in the same conversation without realizing it.\n\nEvery time I try to talk through our issues I'm UNREASONABLE and it's all MY fault! I can't assert myself because that makes be a BAD PERSON.\n\nI GET YOU GIFTS ALL THE TIME BUT YOU DIDN'T GET MY ANYTHING LAST CHRISTMAS OR FOR MY BIRTHDAY!\n\nIf I'd known every act of charity she was doing for me was simply so she could try to guilt trip me for it later I'd have turned her down. Oh, except that would make me even worse than I already am, of course.\n\nYOU THINK I'M SOME KIND OF MONSTER!\n\nHas she ever heard the way she talks about me? About Dad or Mom?\n\nDon't get me wrong, I understand bipolar disease is nasty. I understand that she's under a lot of stress. She has a job she hates, she sees having to move back in as a setback, just like me she's still dealing with the scars of her upbringing and the pain of seeing our mother slip away.\n\nAll I ever wanted for her was a live a happy, peaceful life doing what she enjoys. I tried so hard to convince her when she was in grad school that coming back to this city on a permanent basis was going to make her miserable and now she's miserable and it's clearly¬†*our*¬†fault.\n\nAll I wanted from life peace and quiet, maybe a fulfilling job, maybe a family. Now I can't have any of that because I'm even more of a mess than when I was younger. I don't really need constantly being called a bastard because I used towels she suddenly likes.\n\nI recognize I'm just plain no good. I can't connect with anyone without screwing up. I never leave the house except for doctor visits and very occasional shopping trips with Dad. I¬†*can't*¬†leave my home on my own. My head is too scattered, I don't trust myself to be able to take care of myself. I'm too rooted here mentally. I can't drive. Some days I'm too tired to get out of bed. I'm weak and empty and deformed inside.\n\nI don't know what to do. I don't want any of this. Not a single bit of it. I don't want her charity if it means she can't pay off her debts, I don't want her charity if she's going to weaponize it against me. I don't want to visit my mother because I'm scared Mom won't recognize me and that makes me a bad son. I can't even talk to Dad anymore unless we're alone, but she's messing up even that relationship.\n\nI'm sick and I'm miserable and I don't even have anyone to express it to because my friends are her friends too and I can't trust anyone not to talk to her about it.\n\nI had to take this from off my chest while I was typing because she literally walked into my room without permission the way she has for the last thirty years, read my screen, saw I was posting there and called me an insensitive monster who was probably talking about her behind her back for years and let loose a broad litany of things she's done for me in the past, as usual, as if it excuses her present behavior.\n\nHow DARE I write about how I feel NOW NOW after she bought me a journal (I didn't ask for) a THEMED JOURNAL I don't use and about HER? How can I complain about HER after all she's done for me!?\n\nShe said she regrets crying for me when she thought I was dying and that if she knew what an insensitive, heartless asshole I was she wishes I had.\n\nI don't want any of this. We're in our forties and we're fucking stuck like this and I can't handle this. What do I do? Where can I go? I just want someone to save us all.",

    "title": "Trauma from Toxic Relationship ",
    "selftext": "I am consumed by an overwhelming wave of emotions that I can‚Äôt seem to escape. The memories of my past relationship have resurfaced, bringing with them a cocktail of anger, guilt, sympathy, and deep-seated trauma. I find myself haunted by images of moments where both of us were hurt‚Äîtimes when I was wrong and times when she was wrong. It‚Äôs like a dark cloud that won‚Äôt lift, making me question why this relationship ever happened, why we both had to suffer so much, and why I am left with these scars that feel impossible to heal.\n\nIn our relationship, there were countless moments where I felt suffocated by her overwhelming need for attention, her constant sensitivity, and her inability to let the smallest things go. She would beg for my time, my affection, and my presence, and I remember feeling trapped, unable to even have a moment for myself. I know that I hurt her deeply, sometimes without meaning to, but my words cut like knives‚Äîwords that were harsher than any physical pain, stabbing deeper than I ever intended. And yet, in those moments, I felt powerless, caught in a cycle of hurt and blame that neither of us could escape.\n\nThere were times when she would cry so hard she could barely breathe, and those moments are etched into my mind. I feel haunted by the memory of her pain‚Äîpain that I caused, but also pain that came from her own actions. It‚Äôs as if we were both caught in this toxic dance, unable to break free, each of us hurting the other in ways we never deserved. It was like we were two different kinds of broken people, trapped in a relationship that became a battlefield. We both hurt each other so much, and now, I am left feeling the weight of all that anger, regret, and sadness.\n\nI feel like I am both the villain and the victim in this story. I‚Äôm struggling to come to terms with how I could have been so toxic and hurtful, yet also deeply hurt myself. I carry the guilt of being someone who has caused another person to break down, and at the same time, I am carrying my own trauma‚Äîmemories that feel like wounds that will never heal. I don‚Äôt know how to forgive myself for the mistakes I made, for the words I said, or for the times when I wasn‚Äôt there for her when she needed me. I don‚Äôt know how to forgive her for the ways she suffocated me, for the times she made me feel like nothing I did was ever enough.\n\nI wish I could just erase it all. I wish I could go back and undo the past, to a time when none of this happened, when we never met, never fell in love, and never went through all this pain. I feel cursed, like I am being punished for something I can‚Äôt even understand‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs some kind of karma for my past actions or just a cruel twist of fate. Sometimes, I wonder if I deserve all of this because of the person I used to be, the mistakes I made, the times I rejected God, and how I lived with anger and defiance. It‚Äôs as if all of this suffering is retribution for the person I once was.\n\nBut beyond all the guilt and the blame, there‚Äôs a deeper question that torments me: why? Why did this relationship have to happen? Why did we have to meet, only to tear each other apart in the end? Why did it have to be so toxic, so damaging, so traumatic? Why couldn‚Äôt I just have a normal, peaceful life without these scars? I feel like I‚Äôm drowning in these questions, and there are no answers that bring me peace.\n\nI feel like my innocence has been stolen from me, that life has turned me into someone I never wanted to be. I used to be someone who felt deeply, who was moved by the world, and now I feel numb, disconnected, and almost robotic. I wish I could be a monk, emotionless, unattached, so I would never have to feel this kind of pain again. I wish I could be numb to everything because the hurt is too much to bear. I don‚Äôt want to feel anymore because all it has brought me is suffering.\n\nI‚Äôm tired of this pain that feels endless and relentless. I‚Äôm tired of feeling like the villain and the victim, of carrying this guilt, anger, and trauma with me every day. I just wish I could be free from it all, that I could have a life where none of this ever happened. I‚Äôm struggling to understand why life has turned out this way, why I have to carry this burden, and why I can‚Äôt just live a simple, peaceful life like everyone else.\n\nThis is the pain I‚Äôm feeling right now. I feel broken, haunted, and utterly lost. I hope you can help me find a way to make sense of it all, or at least find a way to live with it.",

    "selftext": "Sorry this is a long post, and a deep part of me.\n\nMy dad has been a drug addict my entire life- 28 years. It‚Äôs a miracle he is still alive. My childhood was truly awful, we had no money because his addiction took everything. Boiling hot water for baths, doing homework in candlelight, cutting holes in stuffed animals to hide money/valuables from him. He would sell anything and everything we had, our car, the few Christmas gifts we‚Äôd get, jewelry, purses, shoes, you know the mind of an addict. The countless times I‚Äôd watch his overdose as a young child, seeing this was so traumatizing for me. He would write fake checks and prescriptions to himself, and got away with it for a long time- then went to prison but picked up where he left off when he got out. My dad is a good guy beneath his addiction. He would give you the shirt off his back, his last dollar, he‚Äôs the one you could call any time of any day and he‚Äôd be there no matter how far, even for a stranger. He suffers with severe depression, and it truly kills me knowing he‚Äôs in that much pain that in order to function he has to get high. The only relationship I have with my father is when he‚Äôs high, that‚Äôs the only time he‚Äôs alive. When he‚Äôs sober, he is a ghost in his own body, you can literally feel his pain just by looking at him. It is so hard to see, that id almost rather him get high so he can at least be alive again, so he can at least talk and laugh. We never discuss his addiction anymore, as my siblings and I have gotten older we‚Äôve had to accept that we will never change him. It is hard for me at times have a relationship with him due to all the damage. I feel I could be a a daughter at times even if he is high. Because there will be a day where I'll wish I did try with him instead of hiding from him. I try to be more mindful as I get older, and I often imagine how he feels every single morning that he wakes up, the pain and terror he‚Äôs reminded with.\n\nI do want to make everyone aware that we have tried everything we possibly can. My dad has been to dozens of rehabs, close to home and out of state. He has tried antidepressants, therapy, AA, etc. but his addiction always wins. & I do not want to seem like this is a ‚Äúpitty me‚Äù post because that is not my intentions what so ever. I‚Äôm grateful I grew up the way I did because it taught me lessons I never would have known.",

    "title": "29M I'm in a dark place rn.",
    "selftext": "Hi, I really need someone to talk to rn.\n\nTLDR version; I'm literally a secret sexting/cyber sex addict, I have severe emotional trauma from a breakup that happened 10 years ago, I think I'm bisexual and I don't know how to handle it, my ADHD is at its worst ever and I feel like I'm not connecting with anyone in my life.\n\nSo I really don't know what fucked me up so badly but I have an idea. In 2014 I was madly in love with this girl who moved here from Texas. It was like the love hard and fast type of love that happens when you are young. We were together for about a year. She was my first real love, I planned to marry her she was absolutely perfect and I was immature and young. We had a rough relationship, she took my virginity and we fought a lot about me being insecure about her personal life. I was young and trying to figure out how to love someone the right way. I was very insecure about the possibility of her cheating on me or really someone stealing her away from me (this sounds so stupid now that I'm older) so we often fought over stupid small things. Near the end, she broke my trust by staying at a co-workers house and she had left her bag there and I saw the text from him about going to pick it up - she didn't tell me she stayed there and I didn't know what to do. A couple months went by and all of this self doubt manifested inside of me in some of the worst ways. We used to have some of the most intense sex i've ever had and I think it was fueled by a lot of my rage about what happened.\n\nThe weird part is that that insecurity about infidelity grew into this horrible perversion where I became hypersexual and addicted to pleasuring her all the time. We ended up breaking up because she told me that I had gay tendencies basically and that I was a \"bitch.\" I'm not gonna lie, when somebody you love tells you that it rips your soul out of your body. I never knew how to fix the damage that I caused to make someone hate me enough to tell me that. We talked it out a day after and it ended with me wrestling her on my bed out of frustration (another horrible thing that I fucking hate myself for) I got off her and she ended up choking me against my closet door and left shortly thereafter. We haven't seen each other in person since then.\n\nI'm not blaming her but, I'm just suffering from that experience still. I'm pretty sure thats where the sexting addiction and many other deviant things grew out of. I feel like I didn't satisfy her enough and that maybe I was gay. Fast forward, I'm in another relationship now which isn't as sexually charged we enjoy normalcy. But, there is still this darkness inside of me that wants to have foursomes, sext nonstop, cheat, etc because I'm so fucked up inside. I need constant outside acknowledgment and like I have weird kinks about stealing my friend's girlfriends and basically dominating other men - this is where the bisexual stuff starts to happen. I am so confused, i don't know whats happening to me.\n\nI keep trying not to blame that breakup but I keep making excuses to protect whatever love I have left for that girl. Its been ten years of mental hell. The only reason I'm posting this is because I finally met someone on discord who is suffering in the same way.",

    "selftext": "So I‚Äôll start with the backstory for context and then get to the issue.\n\nBackstory:\n\nBasically grew up with a neglectful and abusive mother, and an overprotective father. My mom‚Äôs death when I turned 21 sent me into years of drinking to medicate while I drifted from fling to fling. Joined the Army in 2017 and I‚Äôm now in a marriage and a baby on the way that I want but my anger seems hellbent on destroying.\n\nI recently just got back from Europe with the Army and just transferred to my new assignment in Hawaii, dream life right? Well, today started ordinary and when I got off work, my 3 other kids were screaming in the backseat and I had an ERUPTION of anger, like one I reserve for my work in the Army. Naturally, the kids were inconsolable and cried until we got home. I apologized again and again to them after and they accepted my apologies, I don‚Äôt want to hurt them like that again.\n\nThis leads me to my wife, after my eruption I also apologized to her. Now, this isn‚Äôt the first time this has happened, I‚Äôve been angrier especially since coming back from Europe, and we‚Äôve talked about me going to therapy and today I tried meditating in the morning which made me feel good. All that said, the anger I exhibited today was a first. Normally, she and I will have a serious talk and we‚Äôll come away from it feeling better, today that isn‚Äôt the case. She‚Äôs accepted my apologies but told me she feels like I‚Äôm running from myself because I mentioned my meditation and how she thinks I need to ‚Äújust be me‚Äù and ‚Äúwhy did you get married if you don‚Äôt know who you even are?‚Äù\n\nThe issue:\n\nMy anger, but I feel it could be tied to something deeper. My childhood, while traumatic, isn‚Äôt something I think of often. I tend to try and downplay what happened but then when I get angry or emotional, the manifestation of these feelings leads my wife to think something‚Äôs up, which it is.\n\nI need help mastering this anger, I think meditation is a great way forward at least to start, however I feel like deeper analysis of what I‚Äôm feeling and where it might have come from initially may hold merit.\n\nI found an Instagram account that when I watch the videos and read the captions, they almost precisely characterize what‚Äôs going on in my mind and my relationship, that‚Äôs what‚Äôs brought me here today.\n\n\nSorry for being all over the place, if more context is needed please ask! Thank you all!",

It isnt as strong of a pain as it was before, but i still feel extremely guilty towards my friends for still being this way and towards myself for not being able to get out of my depressive episodes half the times unless im actively spending time with someone.

    "selftext": "Hi. On christmas eve morning of 2019 I was in the backseat of my friends car. We were on the way to go to meet up with other friends. I did not secure my seatbelt like an idiot that day and i will forever regret it. He started driving more irratically. Passed 2 cars back to back in a curve and me and my boyfriend looked at eachother, decided not to be back seat drivers for whatever reason and the split second we turned back BAM. We t boned a pickup with farm machinery on the back of it. We spun out and i was ejected out the back windshield 60 geet away into a ditch. The boys were in the car still but rolled up next to me. My initial thought was where are they because I was bigger than them and I was worried that they got flung too(not realising at the time it was because i did not have a belt on) I tried to sit up. Dumbest idea ever i screamed out the most horrific sound. I could wiggle my toes, so i was somewhat calmed by that but only for so long because there was a pool of freezing water. I had a choker necklace on that day and a man from the scene helped take it off as my neck was swelling and i could not breath. I had glass and road burn om my back from sliding. A puncture wound in my arm from a branch. I laid there and cried but tried not to freak out. I was airlifted to a hospital where i underwent fusion back surgery at 17 years old. I learned to walk again over a coyrse of 2 months and went back to wprk at mcds in 4 because the world cannot stop that long if you do not habe the means to support yourself which i did not. I never wanted to be a kid again so bad. To go back to a day without consistent pain. I am 4 years into the journey and althouh i am grateful to be here I still question so much. Why did my boyfriend not remember a single detail about the accident besides putting his shoes on to leave that day? Why did my friend put us in this situation? WHY DID I NOT HAVE MY BELT ON?!?!? Today, i only have a hunch back and some pretty cool scars but the paim is still immense. It is very hard to be 22 years old trying to work as a normal person when you most definitely are not on the inside. Does anyone else have exp being young with a chronic injury and how to deal? I have been in therapy for years. I just want to know others exps. Thank you if you have read this incoherent mess this long.",

    "selftext": "I am a 32 years old unmarried, childless man and I am currently feeling lost in life. Therefore, and facing some embarrassment at first, I picked up the courage to seek professional support from a therapist for the first time in my life. Nonetheless, I've decided to post here in order to get additional advice from both men and women who are part of this community.\n\nI think that my current feeling of being lost (or left behind) in life mainly stems from two circumstances: mild bullying which resulted in the inability to fully experience my teenage years if and when I compare them with the ones experienced by my peers and the loss of my father due to cancer when Covid-19 was ravaging in 2020. The first circumstance, in fact, turned me from a quite extroverted and carefree boy into an introverted, overthinking and resentful man while the second one wreaked havoc in my everyday life as I abruptly lost one of the most important people I was attached to in a phase in which everyone is supposed to settle down both personally and professionally. Cancer is basically like having to deal with a time bomb where you cannot see the timer and this puts you face to face with the precariousness of life.\n\nThose events profoundly affected me, as I practically spent my teenage years most of the time alone focusing on my studies and these last years trying to settle down professionally facing great difficulties in both dealing with people (as I work in Sales & Distribution) and life itself. There are days in which I feel completely absorbed by what I am doing and therefore I manage to get things done as expected without having to deal with what my therapist calls \"intrusive thoughts\" and others in which I feel overwhelmed by a hurricane of negative thoughts and sensations about myself and the future ahead of me that make me cry silently on my pillow as soon as I get home at the end of the day.\n\nI deeply regret the fact of not having been able to experience love in its blossoming, intense and raw nature during my teenage years, unlike my peers, the fact that those times and hangouts will never come back again thus leaving a deep scar inside my heart and lastly, the fact that I am very often going to be at unease in social settings when acquaintances/colleagues etc. discuss about their family, children and career prospects. At the same time I also drastically reduced the amount of time I spend on social media as people just seem to share the good things in their life, but I always try to take any opportunity to hang around my friends and family members, even if some of them are starting a family and this makes me feel at unease as I previously explained. Going out for dinner/ a movie/ a play at the theatre all by myself is too much for me to handle and, quite frankly, humiliating at the moment. Casually going out for some drinks or travelling instead, are more manageable activities but come with some strain as well.\n\nI'd like to become more optimistic and resilient in order not to find myself alone and hopeless as I reach maturity and retirement. What advice would you give me? Thank you for your help and please forgive me if I made some mistakes but I am not a native English speaker.",

    "selftext": "Hi, \n\n  \nI recently posted a technique involving yawning in a separate post and wanted a review on its effectiveness.  \nNow I have a nother one. It's developed by Zivorad Slavinski, a serbian psichiatrist. It's called the Fingertip Method. For me it's verry effective. Do you mind testing and letting me know?  \nDisclaimer: Looks like a gimmick, I know. I'm not selling you anything, just want some feedback on this. Also, the technique requires to recall the incident in as much detail as possible. Don't do it if it's too triggering for you.\n\n  \n Steps below:\n\n1. Choose a specific incident / memory you want to clear of negative emotions.\n2. Close your eyes and recall the incident in as much detail as possible. Try to visualize it associatively (seeing it through the eyes of a participant rather than as an outside observer). If you can see yourself from a distance or from behind, you're not viewing it associatively.\n3. Experience all the negative emotions and physical sensations to the fullest. This is extremely important. Do not suppress anything, or the technique will not work. In fact, try to amplify the negative emotions and sensations as much as possible.\n4. Identify the most emotional moment in the incident and take a mental snapshot of it. In this snapshot, everything you see should be frozen with no movement or change in the angle of view of the situation, the faces of the participants, objects, surroundings, etc.\n5. Stand up straight and imagine the snapshot in front of you!\n6. Extend your dominant hand in front of you at shoulder height, with your index finger pointing at the snapshot.\n7. Imagine that the center of the snapshot is glued to the tip of your index finger.\n8. With the snapshot glued to the tip of your index finger and your arm extended forward, slowly turn to the left, making at least 3.5 circles. Continue to intensify the negative emotions and sensations while you turn left and look at the snapshot stuck to the tip of your finger.\n9. Stop and lower your arm. Let the snapshot fall.\n10. Again, imagine the negative incident. If there are still any negative emotions and physical sensations associated with it, repeat all steps from 3-9.\n11. Repeat steps 3-9 until all negative emotions and physical sensations completely disappear and/or you can no longer clearly remember the incident.\n12. Fill your body with white light. Just imagine a source of white light above your head, from which, with each breath in, light enters your body, gradually filling it, then your aura, and then the entire universe.",

    "selftext": "Hi!\nI, f(32), grew up in an abusive home. I am the eldest of 3 siblings but I had always been my dad‚Äôs punching bag. I received most of the verbal and physical abuse. I still remember vividly the times when my dad physically hurt me when I was as young as 5 yrs old. He would oftentimes use his fist, belt, balloon stick, broom stick and sometimes, anything that he could lay his hands on. He would hit me on my head, back, back of my thighs and anywhere that will be covered with clothes and wont be visible when I go to school. I would be covered in bruises when I go to school. I am too scared to tell any adult worrying that I will get punished worse when I get home. \n\nHe stopped working since I was 3. My mom was the breadwinner. She would leave the house early and come home late so we spent most of our days with my dad. My mom and dad would always fight as well whenever she‚Äôs home and would hit her also. My sisters would also get occassional beatings from my dad. They would fight in front of us.\n\nI loved school so much growing up since that‚Äôs the only time I am away from him. I did my best in school and excelled so much. I wanted to please him in any way I can but would always get discouragement in return. He would always call me stupid or dumb and useless despite being always the top student in my school. He would always say that those medals and awards are useless since to him, I am the dumbest among my siblings. \n\nI grew up with so much anger towards both my mom and my dad. I hated my mom for letting us live that way. And I hated my dad for the obvious reasons. \n\nI ran away from home when I was 14. My mom found me and sent me to my grandparents and lived there until we moved to Canada when I was 22. My grandparents are the best and I love them so much. It was a complete 360 from my everyday life with my parents. \n\nAs an adult, I carried the effects of the trauma. I have the lowest self esteem. I am always too scared of everything. I have depression and anxiety and very bad coping skills. I am a people pleaser. I have issues forming relationships with other people. I have a bachelor‚Äôs degree in healthcare but never used it because I am too scared that if I worked unsupervised, I might end up killing someone and oftentimes, I also feel that I am not good enough. It frustrates me because I feel like I could be more and do more with my life but my trauma is holding me back. \n\nI sometimes try my hardest to overcome these but will just end up stressed and more anxious. I work in customer service and everyday after work, I feel so drained. Therapy is expensive where I live. \n\nIs there any advise or coping skills that you guys think would help me? I am lost. ",

    "selftext": "Hi guys, first time poster. So I‚Äôve made some big changes in my life lately: moved to a new city out of state, went no contact with my narcissistic family, and started my life over. I love my new city and living situation. However, it‚Äôs still a lot of grief to carry, I had to leave my cats, my best friend, and most of my belongings behind. Right now, my best friend suddenly stopped talking to me but I‚Äôm trying to give him time to deal with what he needs to. I have no idea what‚Äôs going on with him but I‚Äôve let him know I‚Äôm here when he‚Äôs ready to speak again. However, I‚Äôm really struggling to cope with the loneliness. The hardest part is my friend not talking to me especially since we made plans to stay in touch right before I left. He‚Äôs not talking to me, my cats aren‚Äôt here, and I have no connections here or in my hometown either. I‚Äôm not sure how to cope, the pain is suffocating most days and I can‚Äôt even do many things anymore. Sometimes I talk to my roommate but they have things to deal with so I try not to bother much. \n\nUsually before the move, I would draw and write and It helped a lot. I would practice mindfulness, recognizing my emotions, asking why, and making a plan to move forward. But lately it just seems like these aren‚Äôt helping, almost like facing this pain completely head on is doing more damage, like I‚Äôm at a dead end for solutions. I don‚Äôt know how to take my mind off the pain, It‚Äôs paralyzing. I can‚Äôt do any typical new city stuff like finding a job, which I quite literally can‚Äôt afford to keep doing. I can‚Äôt get a few scribbles down in my drawings. I try to go out and explore to get my mind off but all I think about is the loneliness and worry about my friend. Ive texted Crisis Textline everyday the past week (waiting for a counselor currently) but honestly it‚Äôs not enough to calm me, 988 is horrible, and I tried warm lines today, which was great, but I know it‚Äôs not a solution. I‚Äôm in counseling with an intern rn because i cant get therapy or medication since I don‚Äôt have insurance.\n\nWhat are some coping skills that don‚Äôt seem so ‚Äúhead on‚Äù I guess you could say? In the past, acknowledging everything in detail helped me cope but now it‚Äôs not. I‚Äôm not sure how to move forward in the opposite direction. Do I just sit here and cry all the time til the pain fades? \n\nI moved three weeks ago and went NC a week ago. Today, my mom messaged my former boss on Facebook asking about me, which is crazy to me, so still dealing with the fallout of that. ",

Please try and let me know what you think. I think it's something like a neurological hack in a way...\n\nthe technique itself is the following:\n\n1. Place one hand on your forehead.\n2. Place your other hand on the back (lower part of the skull).\n3. Close your eyes and concentrate on the problem that is troubling you. Visualize it. (Remember a specific instance when it manifested.) Focus on all the emotions and physical sensations that the presence of the problem causes you. (Anger, sadness, guilt, shame, helplessness, pain, tightness, suffocation, etc.) In no case suppress the negative emotions and physical sensations, but instead make them as strong as you can.\n4. Evaluate the intensity of the negative emotions and physical sensations on a scale of 0-10.\n5. When you cannot increase the emotions and physical sensations associated with the problem anymore, perform a powerful YAWN. Open your mouth wide and take in as much air as possible while yawning. Then, through pursed lips, exhale slowly, leaning forward until you completely empty your lungs. Repeat the yawn 1-2 more times.\n6. Remove your hands from your head and evaluate the level of negative emotions and physical sensations you are currently experiencing regarding the problem you were working on. Note how this problem looks different. It is difficult for you to concentrate on it. The memory is either lost or emptied of emotions.\n7. If you still have any negative emotions or physical sensations associated with the problem, focus on the strongest emotion and repeat the process. Repeat it until there are no more negative emotions. Level 0 on a scale of 0-10.\n\nPlease share your throughts on this, I'm curious.",

    "title": "How to Say No Without Looking Weird or Selfish",
    "selftext": "\n\nFollow these 6 steps to say no without looking selfish. This approach works everywhere, for everyone, whether in professional or personal situations.\n\n\n\nBefore you say no, it‚Äôs crucial to stand for something. You need to identify your ‚Äúaction-values.‚Äù For me, those are:\n\n\n\n- Business\n\n- Health\n\n- Learning\n\n- Flow states\n\n- Social & family\n\n\n\nI say no to everything else. So, take a moment to figure out what your values are. Once you have that foundation, let‚Äôs dive into the steps.\n\n\n\n### Step 1: Say YES\n\n\n\nYes, I know it sounds counterintuitive, but hear me out. When someone asks you to do something, even if you‚Äôre not keen on it, start by saying yes. \n\n\n\nThis doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre committing to the task; it‚Äôs about making the other person feel valued. You want to show respect for their request. For example, you might say, ‚ÄúI love that idea, Joel; sure, I‚Äôll jump right in.‚Äù This sets a positive tone and opens the door for what comes next.\n\n\n\n### Step 2: Say NO\n\n\n\nNow, here‚Äôs where you can gently say no. It‚Äôs important to explain the ‚Äúbecause‚Äù in sufficient detail. \n\n\n\nYou might say something like, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt take that on right now because I have to complete this project I‚Äôm working on.‚Äù It‚Äôs vital that you frame your reasoning in a way that shows your commitment to your current responsibilities. Make sure they understand that what you‚Äôre focused on matters to you, and it should matter to them too.\n\n\n\n### Step 3: Give the Details\n\n\n\nNow it‚Äôs time to share the specifics. Tell them what you‚Äôre currently working on, why it‚Äôs important, and how it aligns with your values. \n\n\n\nThis is a chance to create that ‚Äúaha‚Äù moment for them. Explain why it‚Äôs essential for you to focus on your current project and how it ultimately benefits everyone involved. The more transparent you are, the more they‚Äôll understand your position.\n\n\n\n### Step 4: Look for the Win-Win\n\n\n\nIf they still seem hesitant, look for a way to create a win-win situation. Offer something extra that wasn‚Äôt part of your original plan. \n\n\n\nFor instance, you could say, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do this right now, but I know someone who‚Äôs really great at it.‚Äù This way, you‚Äôre still helping them without stretching yourself too thin. It shows that you care about their needs while staying true to your commitments.\n\n\n\n### Step 5: Don‚Äôt Make Them Look Like Fools\n\n\n\nIf you‚Äôve said no to a request, make sure you follow through on your commitments. Don‚Äôt leave them hanging or make them feel foolish for asking. \n\n\n\nIf you promised to help with something else, do it. Keeping your word is crucial for maintaining trust and respect in your relationships.

    "selftext": "First of all, wow I can‚Äôt really believe I‚Äôm writing this, sorry if there are any typos/mistakes doesn‚Äôt really matter I don‚Äôt know what makes me put myself out there like that. Me (23) female have done a biggest mistake and I don‚Äôt know how to deal with it, honestly think I‚Äôm losing it a little that‚Äôs what makes me write this.  So, when I was a kid I was molested by my cousin-uncle (mother‚Äôs side) it was horrible I guess it went on for some time because I was too young to understand what was actually happening to me, when I first told my mother she hit me, telling me how much of a disgrace I was, I guess I was 8 that time. I think that was when it actually started the physical abuse, negligence from my family, it‚Äôs just my elder sister by 2 years, father and mother, even my sister told me how much she hated me because he was her coolest uncle and she wasn‚Äôt allowed to talk to him anymore anyways so, after that my mother started hitting me a lot and I‚Äôm pretty sure she tried to kill me multiple times too, like one time she held me under force of water, I was only 13 so yea it was pretty horrible but the mistake that I made was falling for some guy when I was 16 he was 23 then I really thought finally someone noticed me, looked at me, loved me oh boy I couldn‚Äôt have been more wrong, we were together for 4 years, I cut contact with all of my friends because he didn‚Äôt like it, sometimes used to hit me too but then I felt like I loved him too much, like in a month even if I get one day of love it would be enough but I guess it was just not enough for him, I picked up part time jobs, he didn‚Äôt work, I used to give him money settle his and his family‚Äôs debts small amounts but considering I was young it meant a lot for me, I was stupid, I was happy I could just help him out you know, anyways, i was 17 when my parents found out about us on my birthday, it was horrible I was beaten to death, I didn‚Äôt see sunlight for next few months, my mother used to spit toothpaste on my face while brushing her teeth to tell me how disgusting I was, it was hell, I couldn‚Äôt stand it, I was determined to get away, I applied for major in university in different city, worked hard, cracked my entrance exam and begged my parents to let me go, it worked, I was soo happy, I think that was one of the best moments of my life, but my boyfriend was another story, I started to realise maybe I can do better, I decided to break up with him around my 18th birthday, few days later I wasn‚Äôt aware he had came near my university in a different city to surprise me, I was in a cafe guys girls were present, then I was towards my dormitory he blocked my path, he said I was a slut for sitting on table with other guys, slapped me everyone was watching, few passerby got him off me, worried for my safety, the situation blew up, dormitory head got involved because the security recorded the footage, my parents were called in, they packed my bags took me home, I thought it was over, I didn‚Äôt want to go back there, I knew what was going to happen, in the car my mother already punched me in the face and slammed my head to the window, I knew what was gonna happen, I was shivering in fear, when I got home, nothing happened the next day it started again I was getting beaten up then I just couldn‚Äôt take it anymore I had enough, I screamed that I don‚Äôt want to be there anymore, she flipped, threw me out of the house and told me to never come back again, I don‚Äôt know what happened but I just ran and ran and ran, I didn‚Äôt know what to do, I saw someone in the car asked the driver to lend me his phone, I didn‚Äôt have anyone‚Äôs number memorised only my boyfriend I knew it was a bad decision but I was desperate I had to get out, I begged to help me with some money so I can go back to the city my university was in, then I would‚Äôve thought of something but he said his friends will pick me up, then they did come took me to Highway, there my boyfriend‚Äôs parents and sister were there, I think it‚Äôs a blank in my head but suddenly they convinced me that I should marry my boyfriend, they can take me in, don‚Äôt have to get beaten up again, and even though he hit me at the end he loved me, I don‚Äôt know what I was thinking, I said yes, next thing I know I was married (to be honest, now that I know rituals I think it was fake, nothing was done) we didn‚Äôt even register officially with the government it was more like mosque papers, anyway, I was okay, I thought no matter what at least I might get someone who loves me beside me, again one of the most stupidest decision i made, he didn‚Äôt work, he was never home, his family was there but it wasn‚Äôt the same, and even though my own parents treated me horribly, I was their flesh and blood I missed them terribly, they sent me court papers to have myself removed from any will my parents might have in the future, I tried to study hard but my mother in law wanted me to drop out, suddenly I wasn‚Äôt even allowed to go outside the house, then I started to realise another problem, no one in the family worked ever, I was there I could see, then where was the money coming from? How could they afford rent, living standards heck even food, I tried asking if there is any business or source of income they said no there isn‚Äôt, and I realised I may have gotten myself into something worse.\n\nMy father tried to contact me, since childhood he never believed me, even if he saw bruises or blood, my mother told him, I was being disciplined because I made some mistake, he always believed her, so contacted me told me, he has something to talk about with me, I agreed I was just happy I could see someone from my family again, we met up, he said he has some friends who are cops, I knew them, they did some digging and apparently my now mother in law and sister in law had some sugar daddy in exchange of their bodies and that there were people who were ready to testify in front of me, I knew he was saying it for me, I had these doubts myself but I just loved him so much I didn‚Äôt know what to do, at this point, my parents started to contact me again, they were scared because someone threatened them that I was not going to walk to alive of that house, I even lied and sneaked out when I was meeting my father the first time, I didn‚Äôt know what was true anymore, my in-laws didn‚Äôt want me to keep contact with my family, my parents on the other hand wanted me to come back immediately no matter what because the threats were getting worse, I didn‚Äôt know what to do, I also didn‚Äôt want to leave him too, I thought it was 1 person for a lifetime, he was my husband I slept with him, I couldn‚Äôt have that with anyone else, I thought he was my saviour, but who was I kidding he was not, then his best friend called me, asked me to meet up, she said my husband was there too, I went there, and suddenly everything was over, she said she was pregnant with his child, I felt my whole life slipping away, I was shocked, she said he has been sleeping with her a month before my relationship with him started fuxk, I was so dumb, 3 years and I didn‚Äôt realise anything, I was soo stupid, I threw my life away for something which wasn‚Äôt even real, at that moment I knew he never loved me, it was a perfect illusion I couldn‚Äôt see past that. It was over, I knew I couldn‚Äôt do this anymore, I contacted my other uncle who‚Äôs a lawyer asked for help, told him I wanted to end everything and leave from there, they came, my father was present, damn, I was a laughing stock, it had been only 4 months and everyone thought I couldn‚Äôt deal with hardship, we signed divorce papers, I don‚Äôt know why because we never even registered it officially but I guess it was their way of making sure I don‚Äôt ask for anything, I was never planning too anyways, I still remember I was sitting in a care with my luggage and I could see him from the passenger window, he looked at me, gave me a bright smile, and waved goodbye to me, like he couldn‚Äôt wait for me go from his life, I‚Äôll never ever forget that in my life, I didn‚Äôt want to go home at all, I left for another city towards my university, I completed my studies, got a job, and at 22 I moved to another country because I got a better opportunity, at 23 it‚Äôs been 5years now, I don‚Äôt go home much, but my parents came around, especially my mother she apologised for her behaviour, she regrets it and wants to treat me better, they supported me mentally, financially till I was stable on my feet and I‚Äôm really really grateful for that, I‚Äôll never forget that in my life too but I just can‚Äôt move on, those memories are poison, they seep into my soul every night, I couldn‚Äôt get myself in any relationship after that I know no one wants that kind of baggage in their life, every time I come close to talking to someone I think I never ever want to go through that kind of heartbreak in my life and just can‚Äôt build anything, friendships, relationships, acquaintances I feel like I‚Äôm cursed, those memories they don‚Äôt let me live, it‚Äôs been 5 goddamn years but I feel so much guilt for tarnishing my parents name, letting them down and really don‚Äôt want to blame but I feel guilty to think that it was just wasn‚Äôt me alone, every action set a chain of reactions I couldn‚Äôt break, or maybe it‚Äôs just me blaming someone else, I AM responsible for ruining my own life, I made those decisions, now I have the tag of divorcee at young age, I can‚Äôt even date normally, everything is just ruined, my life is ruined and I have no idea what I‚Äôm gonna do anymore.",

    "title": "Abused at 13-14 and still struggling to put it behind me at 23.",
    "selftext": "Hi, I wasn't sure where to go with this but I think I mostly just want to vent.\nWhen I was 12 I had unsupervised internet access, and had lived my life as long as I could remember that way. I was super into Vocaloid and anime and had a group of online friends who would group call on Skype alot. I had \"dated\" people online before, and was one of those kids who really thought I was an adult, capable of well thought out and rational decisions. Again, I was 12. \nI met a dude named Will through my Skype friends, he was 16-17. I can't remember who introduced him or how our first conversations went but he stuck with the group for about a year and I started crushing on him pretty hard. We started calling one on one, he introduced me to his real life friends and I introduced him to mine. I was 13 by the time we started \"dating\" and he was a month away from turning 17. \nIt didn't take long until he was demanding nudes, and I already had sexual trauma and severe attachment issues, so when I would say no I don't want to do these things and he would get mad, to me the obvious solution was to just do the thing. He might leave me if I don't, so just do it and don't think too hard about it. This got worse, and pretty soon I knew I was expected to masturbate on camera for him whenever he would ask, no matter what I was doing or how I felt. Usually multiple times a day.\nWhen summer between 8th and 9th grade rolled around, I spent 24/7 in calls with him, Skype all day long and messenger on my tablet while I slept. Not having the escape of school made things so much worse. At this point he began having problems with my friends (probably because they knew the situation was fucked up and were gently trying to get me out of there), and slowly I began to block all of my friends who didn't like him. This broke my heart, but again I was a stupid, anxiously attached, traumatized child and it didn't feel like there were any other options. \nWhen 9th grade started, he couldn't handle the loss of control and he was constantly accusing me of cheating on him. I only spent 2 or 3 weeks in public high school before I begged my parents to switch me to homeschooling, I told them I was too anxious to stay there. \nThis went on for almost a year, shutting myself in my room all day every day and spreading my legs 3 or 4 times a day for the pleasure of a man who made me abandon all my friends and family.\nChristmas day that year, my mom walked in on me while that was happening. It was extremely scarring, but ultimately the best thing that could of happened, I don't think I would of ever left of my own volition. She took all my devices and took my door off it's hinges. It was finally over. \n\nI don't know why I did any of that. I hated every second of it, I hated him I was scared of him, scared of him flying to my state and sneaking me out of my parents house like he said he would. I'm so angry at myself more than anything, for allowing my life to fall apart like that, for allowing this man to ruin me. I felt so dirty and ashamed and I still do. How vile of me. Had I no self respect? Obviously not. I don't know. I'm 23 now, and I know I've never delt with this properly. I still get flashbacks, break down crying on bad days, and do double takes when I see someone who looks like him. I refuse to set foot in a 300 mile radius of his state, I never ever ever want to ever see this man's face again. And while I feel so strongly, I still struggle with \"do I even have a right to be upset?\" No one had a gun to my head, it would of been so simple to block him. But I didn't.\nI plan on going to therapy, but it and life are both so very expensive, so it hasn't been in cards and probably won't be for a while. I'm hoping to get good insurance when open enrollment starts at the end of the year so maybe therapy can be a viable option.\nThank you if you read this far, I appreciate you hearing my tale of woe. I would really like to be able to move past this, I just have no clue how.",

For the first two years of my life, I lived with my grandparents, which was a rare period of stability.\n\nWhen I was 3, I moved back in with my parents, and the abuse resumed. My father would come home drunk and violently beat my mother almost every night. When I was 13, we moved to a new house, and my father left his job, claiming he would start a business with a friend. Instead, he took money from my mother without contributing and had an affair with a widow. He supported her and her child financially, while neglecting our family‚Äôs needs.\n\nAt 16, I had to step in when my father was attacking my mother. I ended up getting injured in the process, and it felt like I was fighting not just for her safety, but for my own as well. My mother has also been abusive towards me, including an incident when I was younger where she threw me against a wall in anger.\n\nI had a romantic relationship that I deeply cared about, but it ended painfully when the person I loved left me for someone else.

Thankfully, my friend was able to help me and make me feel safe.\n\nLater that night, I was able to type out more about these memories in a text I sent to my friend when I got home from hanging out with him. \n\nBelow is an edited version of what I sent him:\n‚Äî-\ni have flashes of memories from when i was a child - couldn‚Äôt have been older than 5 of a washing machine repair guy coming to our house and my\nparents asked me to not be downstairs while he was there (just to stay out of his hair) but i didn‚Äôt listen and i just have these like blurs of me being on my parents bed (in the room next to the bathroom where the laundry was) and him tickling me, saying how cute i was, and then one of my parents walking in and getting visibly upset - and i did have my first UTI around that time\n\nthe doubter in me is like i have no memory of Bad Stuff happening but i think the reaction i had trying to share it + the fact i have flashes of memory that feel incomplete + the UTI . Those are all usually indicators \n\nand i have a vivid memory of when my mom taught me that it was wrong for people to touch me there (when i was going to go to school for the first time) i told her that i had been touched down there before and she got really upset and so i told her i was just kidding because i didn‚Äôt want to see her upset\n\ni don‚Äôt know what to do with this information now because i have a gut feeling it did happen but also i have this instinct to protect myself from it and not think about it because it hurts too much\n‚Äî-\nI guess I‚Äôm just looking for solidarity or support or to be validated in this gut feeling I‚Äôm having. I‚Äôm 23, so I have no idea if that‚Äôs too late to be remembering childhood trauma or maybe if my brain is just fabricating this? I‚Äôve been feeling absolutely guilt ridden and awful ever since I‚Äôve had this realization/ put these pieces together.\n\nIs a complicated relationship with sex typical for CSA survivors? Is vaginismus? \n\nI just don‚Äôt know what to do. I feel so heartbroken for my younger self. I‚Äôm so sad.",

    "selftext": "Very detailed: the guy Maurice knew.\n\n\nI was at the 7/11 in my area. And I met a man. ( Don't know him) And I guess he just so happened to know that I was looking for a job or something. Because he starting asking me if I'm looking for a job and started to suggest a trash job for me. And he told me that he'll send the trash job to my phone. So I agreed. About 2 days later, ( I completely forgot about him and his trash job thing.) 2 days later, he texted me. Asking me if we could met up basically at the 7 11 again. So I agreed. ( It was late at night, but my friend actually wanted to me to met at the same place around the same time too. But my friend wants me to wait for him for about 4 hours in his car. \n\n( And of course I didn't want to do that, even though sometimes I would.) I just thought that since the man ( trash job guy) wanted to met up there. \n\n\nI thought that, it would make time go faster, if I hangout with the ( trash job guy) for a little bit until my friend finish work. ( My friend works at the 7/11.\n\n So I knew that I wouldn't be far. So I decided to hangout with ( trash guy) to past the time. We talked. And had alittle to drink. ( alcohol- silver Tequila) I had alittle bit, because I didn't want to do too much, because I was hanging with someone that I didn't know. \n\n\nSo fastword. He asked me is it ok if he could masturbate in front of me. I told him sure. Because he wanted to. (so he can feel better, and I thought that  maybe if I let him do that then he would be ok, and we can just go back to talking.) After he did that, he asked me can I put my mouth on him. ( I didn't want to) so I told him no. ( When I told him no, I still just wanted to talk to him. Because he made me feel like I was important and that he cared about what I actually had to say.)  ( I don't have support from no one, from family, friends etc. No one.) \n\n\nBut he actually made me feel important and made me feel like my pain/personal problems really matters to him. The reason why I'm saying this is because what I did next, I felt like l leaned him on.).  .... Here it goes:. So after I told him no. ( When he asked me to put my mouth on him.) He started leaning really close to me. Trying to touch my chest. And I felt uncomfortable, so I got up. And walked a few feets away from him. But I thought about ( how he made me feel and I did enjoy the conversation we was having earlier), so I decided to go back to him and I told him \" hey, huh I really enjoyed talking to you and stuff, that's all.\" Something like that. And the next thing I remember was that he was trying to touch me again. ( But this time)  when I tried to get up and walk away from him. He grabbed my arm and asked me to sit down. ( I didn't want to sit down so I didn't.) Then he asked me to sit down again but in a more demanding tone. ( And I still didn't want to sit down, so I didn't.) Then he kicked the back of my left leg, causing me to fall onto his lap.and grabbed my hands in a heading position. (Where I could not move my hands as freely as I would like. then he started to touch my v-lady part. I tried to move his hand away, but he put pressure on my v-part. And I still tried to move his hand. And when he moved his hand, he tried to pull my pants down, and when he did that I pull my pants back up but then he pull it back down. At this point I started to say, \" I wanna go home, repeatedly, and then I said no. But in a really low tone.( I was actually surprised that he heard me)\n\nYeah I said no. But In a really low tone... And when I said it, I was on his lap at this point, and I just bend closer to my legs.Because I was really nervous to say it in a louder tone. (And since I was on his lap I guess it looks like I was bending my back to him. Which is not what I mean to make him think that I wanted him or anything..üò£üò£üò£\n\nI just did that because ( I didn't want to sound rude or anything. And I also was to scared to say it louder. \n\nTbh, it was really hard for me to be able to even say it in even in a soft low tone Way, as I did. I was really nervous and kinda scared.) \n\n\nAfter, I said no in a soft-low tone.\n\nI heard him say that he was gonna put it in. And then, I felt him inside of me from behind. (But he wasn't all the way in, but in enough for me to feel it. And when I felt it, I started screaming it hurts over and over.\n(And note at this point  I did this:\nBut mines didn't.after I told him that I wanted to go home. (I felt stupid for doing this but I think I felt like I was just acting on confusion.\n\nBut right after I told him that I didn't want to go home. He then tried to put himself inside of me. I got really scared and got up alittle bit. And was screaming: \"your hurting me, your hurting.\"\n\nAnd I guess since he kicked me onto his lap earlier I guess I just didn't know what to do. So I went back on his lap.\n\nThen he started to touch my chest and I started to try to move his hands. But then he put them back on me.\n\nI feel regretful because I went back on his lap.\n\nAnd honestly I felt like everything that happened was because I did that.)\n\nSo but me doing this I question  if it's rape or not.\n\n\n\nAnd then the next thing I remember was that he was trying to touch my chest again and I tried to move his hand away from my chest, but he kept putting his hands back on me. Fast-forward. I was struggling with him, and I almost fell/my body leaned on the bench. And ( I think when he saw me almost fall. He tried to force me down on the bench. And he did. My body was laying there.... But I think he heard something in the area. and just grabbed my personal bag. And took it with him.( I really needed that bag it had all my id, birth certificate, and SSn in that bag. So, of course I needed to get that. So, I followed him to the place that he went to, it was in a more darker area. But ( I didn't want to lose my personal stuff.) So I kept going. When I caught up with him, he was sitting down on another bench. And he was just sitting there. ( At this point, I didn't know what to do. I just looked at him.) And he asked me why I'm acting like that.( My body was kinda in a scared  standing position.) And he started saying stuff, that made me feel like I was overthinking the whole situation. Basically saying, \" why you being like that... And etc (so I felt stupid and I thought if I played it off,maybe we could just talk and I'll get my bag back . At least that's what I thought.) So I sat next to him, I didn't get a chance to say anything. He already touching my chest, and I tried to moved away, but he was holding me so hard that I had to struggle until we fell off the bench. When we fell, I asked him not to hurt me. And he told me that he won't. I tried to get up and next thing I remember was that on the bench he kissed me, and then I move my face away from him. Then, I remember that he pull my pants off and started to do it to me.\n\n\n",

I do remember waking up every single night at around 4 am to hearing her with her vibe(rator) or a man when I was in the fourth grade.

Then when I was around 11-12 we lived in a house and she would bring man, after man, after man, after man every night even our roommate would get ahold of my father to tell him I need to be taken from my mother because she was bringing so many men into the household with me there. I do remember she grounded me one time in that house and she called me down and a man handed me my phone and behind her and the man there was another woman and man and the man told me to ‚Äúbe a good girl and stop treating my mom bad‚Äù or some shit like that. Then my mom got pregnant with my sister when I was 12 and she told me her entire pregnancy she wouldn‚Äôt make me watch my sister until my sister was born and I was forced to watch her. I practically raised her. When I was 12-13 we lived in a place I prefer not to say (I‚Äôm embarrassed of it) but she decided to have sex infront of me and give me my sister to watch so she can go do that. All that was blocking us was a curtain. When I was 14 we lived in her (ex) boyfriends home and me and my baby sister shared a room and her and her ex would constantly have sex waking me and my sister up. (My sister was two) I would be exhausted the next day at school due to staying up for hours in the middle of the night. I even brought up to her how she needs to quiet down and she laughed in my face. I have panic attacks and nightmares about it and have had them for plenty of years. Panic attacks triggered by stories of people‚Äôs family members having sex (teenagers share too much), panic attacks triggered by pregnancy announcements because I developed a huge fear of pregnancy and pregnant women.

Since my birth, my parents had shifted to another city in which we had no family, due to my father‚Äôs job. As an only child, I grew extremely comfortable of having only them around and was very attached to both of them. However, even then my mother had always been extremely strict and critical, for example she‚Äôd always expect me to be at the top of my class and I remember being scared of not coming first because ‚Äúwhat would my mother think of me‚Äù. Regardless, I had a very codependent attachment style with her and remember loving her a lot. All of that changed when my father took retirement and we were supposed to shift back to my parents‚Äô previous hometown. \n\nMy mother and I shifted a few months earlier than my dad, and I was only 11 at that time. The only place she could think of staying was at her own parents‚Äô home (who had died), and this is also where her sister resided with her family. We took the upper floor, but my world turned upside down when my mother‚Äôs sister started abusing me in every way imaginable (except sexually). Sometimes, she would mock me and ridicule me for my appearance, and when I‚Äôd complain, she would beat me up relentlessly. Shoes, belts, slaps, punches, you name it. Other times, she would just call me ‚Äúdisobedient‚Äù and use that as an excuse to beat me up. In all of those occasions, my mother never intervened. She never protected me. She never even stepped in and said, ‚Äústop what you are doing to my daughter.‚Äù She‚Äôd just watch me getting beaten up and then later come to me and tell me that ‚Äúit‚Äôs for your own good‚Äù. When I‚Äôd threaten them that I would call and tell my father, they would lock me up and prevent me from speaking to him. All of my calls with him would be monitored, in fact, whenever my father‚Äôs siblings would visit and we would visit them, I‚Äôd be told to not tell them anything personal because ‚Äúwe shouldn‚Äôt tell anyone what goes on at home. What happens at home is private and can‚Äôt be discussed.‚Äù Once my father moved in with us, things got better for a while until it started again, in other ways.

If my aunt wouldn‚Äôt hit me, I‚Äôd be ridiculed, shamed for absolutely everything, I used to love sketching at the time and she would mock me for being so bad at it and I remember once that she saw a sketch made by me, tore it up, and threw it on the floor, and then she brought the broom, and put it in the trash. I don‚Äôt remember sketching after that day. Even during those incidents , my mother never stepped in. Instead, when I‚Äôd try to fight for myself, she would scold me and then later force me to apologise to her sister. When my father would step in, he‚Äôd get thrashed by my mother. \n\nA couple of years later, my father bought and built a home for us to move into, and that‚Äôs when my nightmare came true. My mother‚Äôs sister decided to move in with us. She used the excuse that she had to sell her parents home as my mother wanted her share of the property and somehow she was our responsibility now. My father had absolutely no say in the matter as my mother had made his life hell also. Why he never took a divorce, I will never understand and maybe that‚Äôs the only thing I will never forgive him for. In our new home, my aunt tortured me just as much. I was 15 then. Once, when I fought back, she tried to suffocate me with my own pillow. I remember my mother meekly asking her to not to do it. She also scratched me on my face and I remember having a giant scar on my eyebrow, and my mother blackmailed me into not telling anyone why I got it. I don‚Äôt understand how or why I obeyed her, but I did. I told no one.\n\nThey moved away a couple months after that. It wasn‚Äôt because of what she had done to me, but because her husband could finally afford to pay rent in a separate home. The physical abuse stopped and hasn‚Äôt happened to this day. She was always a tormentor though, and is to this day. Since my mother is still pretty close to her, she is often visiting our place and sometimes she says or does something because of which I fight back. Even after all these years, my mother never took my side. My relationship with my mother never got fixed because of this. She never defended me, and I will never forgive her for it. \n\nLast week, an incident occurred because of which I had to intervene and I did so in a very calm manner. Next thing I know, my aunt called, screamed at me and called me names before cutting the calls. I was not at all disrespectful, even though considering the monster she is, I should have been. My mother was listening to all of this and her next move wasn‚Äôt at all surprising. She called her sister and started taking her side, and after that call when I screamed at her about her sister being such a monster, my mother had the audacity to scream at me and asked me to shut up.\n\nSince that fight, my mother and I have not spoken. In fact, after pulling verbally abusing me, her sister had the audacity to come over to our place and taunt me again, but this time I was firm and fought back equally, which pissed my mother off even more. What broke my heart most was how my mother was sitting with her sister having coffee, and the only thing I could think of was ‚ÄúI would never sit with my daughter‚Äôs abuser, much less give them my time of the day.‚Äù \n\nIn previous incidents when something like this occurred, I try my best to communicate with my mother later. I try to tell her how much her actions have traumatised me and how my entire life has been affected by her lack of protecting me, and each time she promises to do better. Either that, or she finds horrible excuses to defend herself or even her sister. If nothing else, she asks me to ‚Äúforgive and forget.‚Äù \n\nI have been to therapy, and I have tried everything in the book to help myself get through this. I want to break free of this constant pain of feeling unsafe. I have occasional nightmares and wake up crying and screaming, and in all of those nightmares, what hurts more isn‚Äôt that my aunt is abusing me, but that my mother never defends me. I cannot move out of the country because my father is old and sick and the only family I really have. I love him enough to give up everything else in the world. But all this pain is making me go insane and I no longer know what to do. I don‚Äôt involve my father usually because of his health problems, but when I do, he stands by my side and fights for me, but it is pointless because my mother is extremely controlling and emotionally blackmails everyone. \n\nI want to clarify that it may seem that my mother is lonely and dependent on her sister, and that is not true. It may also seem that my mother is in an abusive marriage which could explain why she thinks it‚Äôs okay to tolerate abuse, and that is also not true. My father, although not the most romantic man on earth, has never even spoken to my mother in a loud tone. He has always been caring, loving, and supportive despite my mother treating him like absolute shit. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "selftext": "TW addiction + abuse\n\nGrowing up my brother and I never really got along. We would fight all the time, He would hit me, steal my toys and break them, prank/scare me on purpose etc. My parents always said it was normal sibling rivalry type stuff and we would grow out of it, but as we got older it just got worse. He started using drugs and alcohol and would steal things from my room and my purse, verbally abuse me, and say gross sexist stuff to me. He has serious rage issues that his substance abuse exacerbates, and literally becomes a completely different person when he's drunk. We have physically fought during one of his drunken rampages at 3am in our front yard because he threatened my Mom and I intervened to protect her. My Dad all but fully disowned him before he passed away, and my brother never attempted to repair their relationship while Dad was alive. He says the most hateful, disturbing things about my parents to me, and blames everyone else for his problems with addiction. He has a daughter who he never gets to see because of his issues. I know he has A LOT of regrets in life and things didn't pan out for him the way he thought they would, and I have always tried to be understanding and supportive because I understand that addiction is an illness. But the way he treats me and my Mom makes it impossible, and frankly, he terrifies me. He's been in and out of AA, but it never seems to stick. He's even fought with my husband, telling him \"he's not really family, no matter how much he tries to be.\" When my husband and I moved, I begged my Mom not to tell my brother where we were moving because he would randomly just show up on our doorstep drunk out of his mind and extremely confrontational. There is a lifetime of terrible things he's done to me, but I would be writing this forever.  \n\nWhen our Dad passed away, I thought things would change. My brother stepped up and helped my mom with the funeral home while my husband and I traveled back home (we've moved a few states away.) He really took charge and I was proud of him for the first time ever. My husband and I paid for the cremation (my Dad didn't want a funeral) and us paying for the whole thing made my brother super angry, and he accused us of trying to show him up. All we wanted to do was make it as easy as possible on my Mom, who frankly couldn't afford it. My brother doesn't have a dime to his name so we knew it would fall on us, and we were absolutely fine with that. His reaction made an extremely sad time for all of so much worse. Later, I thought things would be ok when we had a long conversation about Dad. But then after a weird uncomfortable silence, he said \"I could kill you so easily right now.\" Then he just laughed and said \"I'm just kidding. just wanted to see your reaction.\" It scared the shit out of me.\n\nRecently, my husband and I have discussed having kids. We've been married 11 years now, and kids were never really on our radar for a lot of reasons. But after losing my Dad, and how close he and I were, I've felt like that's something I want to experience with my own child. However, since my relationship with my brother is so traumatic, I'm honestly terrified that there's a chance my child might be like him. I feel like I'm probably being irrational, but I sincerely have no clue how I would handle it if my kid was even remotely like him at all. He and my Dad share a name, and I wanted to honor my Dad by naming my child after him but because it's the same as my brother's, that's totally off the table. I don't want anything reminding me of him when I look at my child because I'm afraid it will affect how I treat that child. I want so badly to be a good Mom, but I'm so scared my traumas are going to affect how I raise my children. I also don't want my brother to have any contact with my kids, but I feel like I won't have much choice in that because he just inserts himself in my life no matter how much I try to avoid him or cut contact. He finds me, or he blows up my phone, or bothers people close to me until I respond. I don;t even answer the door if someone knocks because I'm afraid its going to be him, and I live 3 states away. I really want a baby, but I don't know how to get past this feeling. ",

    "selftext": "I'm 20M and have never been in an intimate relationship, Im starting to question whether its a result of trauma I experienced as a child.\n\nI'm not sure if this constitutes as trauma, mostly because I don't remember a lot of it. But when I was a kid I was often touched by girls my age, some would randomly kiss me, and touch me or my body without asking. This later stemmed into bullying in the form of girls asking me out then laughing at my response or making me feel dumb for even considering the fact that I was ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù go on a date with them. I remember once at recess a bunch of girls from my grade surrounded me and were saying how much I wanted to go on a date with a girl in my glass, but that I wouldn't get her‚Ä¶ Girls would often poke fun at my features and call me names based on them which only further broke me down.\n\nThis all sounds silly I know, but I feel like its affected my relationships and view of women. I'm terrified of women, speaking to them, forming relationships‚Ä¶ and it absolutely hurts me so much. Anytime I get a match on tinder or a compliment irl I always assume its just them making fun of me. When I'm speaking to a girl in person my first reaction is to exit the convo and it usually ends awkwardly. I think girls can sense my hesitancy and awkwardness which only makes it that much more difficult for me to make that first step.\nI really want to move on with my life and form relationships, go on my first date, have my first meaningful relationship with a women but I just don't know how.\n\nI also lack very little friendships in general, mostly because Im not in school, and I dont really have a lot in common with guys my age (due to my skittish nature around the topic of women). Because of this, im scared that any relationship I do form with a women will be torn away because I dont have the fundamental friendship/relationship balance needed to succeed long term.\n\nI definitely struggle with trusting others aswell which is why I keep to myself a lot. That's probably the biggest thing to be honest, I feel like I always need to lie about who I am and its mentally exhausting and unsustainable at that. I've tried to be honest with friends, but they usually leave once I express myself and reveal aspects of myself I'm sensitive about.¬†For example as a kid I would act out a lot at home, mostly because I was holding in so much after dealing with my school life that I just had such a short temper by the time I got home. This would result in name calling, then eventually lead to angry outbursts and yelling matches with family, which lead to throwing and breaking stuff‚Ä¶ My parents, in response to this thought it was a good idea to call me names as a way to combat my behaviour. They would threaten me, tell me they would kick me out, hit me, send me off to a halfway house, get a divorce, call one of my dads friends to ‚Äústraighten me out‚Äù, sign me up for ‚Äúshock therapy‚Äù and send me to a psych ward among physical abuse as well. They used intimidation as opposed to love and it hurt a lot.¬†\n\nOn top of all that, perhaps the biggest worry and biggest threat to me was that they would record me while I was acting out and threaten to send it to the police, my teachers at school, my classmates‚Ä¶ It was torture, having to go to school everyday not knowing if my parents who I thought I could trust were telling the truth about their threats. I didn't know if I would walk in to my class making fun of me and bullying me further with the assistance of my parents videos. They would constantly record me as leverage and it damaged me so much mentally.\n\nI eventually stopped trusting them and everyone for that matter. I still don't trust them to this day, as they still (as a 20 year old) threaten me and use intimidation to try and weaken my self image. When I tried working out to gain self confidence my dad must‚Äôve felt like it was a dick measuring contest, and that I was trying to compete with him or something. I say this because he would always make comments about how I ‚Äúthought I was tuff‚Äù or ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm strong now‚Äù because I was working out to try and improve myself. Keep in mind my dad is a fat piece of shit who loves to put others down, and seems to think he‚Äôs better than everyone. If he sees someone in public who is strong, or someone on tv using their strength he always seems to make a snarky remark like ‚Äúoh thats nothing‚Äù, downplaying literal strangers.\n\nI think because of all that, I struggle with a lot in life with confidence, friendships and relationships making me feel as though I cant open up and be intimate with a parter or friend. Im anxiety ridden and suffer with Bipolar which only adds to the cluster fuck of uncertainty in my life. I really want advice on how I can start. \n\nI do match with girls on Tinder a lot and talk with them, but I‚Äôm always thinking that they don‚Äôt like me and I‚Äôm scared that they are just pretending to like me. I also tend to feel as though I‚Äôm disgusting them by speaking to them, and that I should almost feel bad for engaging with them in general, even though they swiped on me. Due to my uncertainty and fear I have never taken the conversation from phone to in person, not even facetime or phone call. Ive been on Tinder for over a year and lead on hundreds of matches and I just cant keep living like this. I need advice.",

So basically when i was young my mom and dad got divorced, and yk the regular thing I had to go over to his house every weekend because of visiting rights. I now know my mom left him due to drug problems, and he wasn‚Äôt much support. So one night my brother and I are sleeping and he comes in, in such a hyper, scared, pacing way telling me to wake up. My brother had his crib next to mine so he got him out his bed. He told me to get our pillows and come with him. I was asking why and he said that someone was coming after us. I went along with it and listened. We went to his room on the floor next to the sliding glass door with no curtains. It was dark outside and just dirt. He kept pacing back and forth while i just laid there watching everything. My brother was falling asleep. Then he told us to get up and follow him, so we did. We weren‚Äôt crying i think. So we go into the kitchen which there was a sliding door close by, and he‚Äôs asking me, What do you see? Who do you see? Tell me? He wouldn‚Äôt take nobody for an answer so i told him ‚Äúi see uncle j and uncle d looking with their flashlights for something‚Äù I forced myself to imagine that they were legit looking for something on the ground with flashlights. I could see it with my eyes but in my head if that makes sense. He moved us away from there quick, and sat us at the closest living room next to the front door. He opened the door and screamed hella loud saying ‚ÄúLEAVE US THE FU*K ALONE GO THE FU*K AWAY‚Äù I just stared i didn‚Äôt really know what to do. I don‚Äôt remember thinking that much. I just remember seeing it all. After that I don‚Äôt remember anything until the next morning. I was walking to my mom‚Äôs car and he said that we couldn‚Äôt leave because the police were gonna question us. My mom was mad but thats all i remember. I don‚Äôt think we saw him after that. Every time I brought it up to somebody when i was a little older id get shut down quick. I have never told anybody but my best friend. But she‚Äôs dumb and doesn‚Äôt understand. I see my dad still and talk to him, he lives in a different state now. There was also times when i was younger that the roommates he was renting the rooms to, he would get in big ass fights with and he would yell super loud. But he is nothing like that now, like not even to my mom when they were married. He never yells or yelled until after the divorce. I‚Äôm not naive and i know that he was obviously on something, i‚Äôm not sure what but i‚Äôm to scared to ask him yet. But i want to know if anyone has been in a situation like that and how does it affect you as a person? I can remember everything to vividly. It‚Äôs crazy idk how to feel about it ",

    "selftext": "Sorry for the long story i just need to vent out.\n\nI need help. July 3, 2024 in the philippines very sunny afternoon in cainta, Rizal. I was going to my girlfriend's house which is a little far from mine. I commuted on the way there on a jeep. And for some reason there is this guy that i caught an eye with hop on the jeep but its only a few walks from being the last stop of the jeep  and i wondered why didnt that guy just walked a little and he rode the jeep without paying but i didnt mind. As the jeep stoped i was the last one that got down and i knew that the guy that i mentioned is the last next to me that get down. As i walked up the footbridge im climbing up the stairs sort of slowly cause i had acl and mcl on my right knee so i cant climb up the stairs fast. As im done climbing up the stairs I then suddenly felt my small bag (which inside i had my phone(iphone13) and wallet with 1000peso bill) it suddenly felt light,\n\nI had the urge to check it and as i glance I saw what i thought my the zipper of my bag is a little open but when i fully take a look at it my whole bag is open and checked that my phone is gone, some of you maybe think that its only a phone but for me its everything that i had and i very worked hard for it. Heart beats faster and faster as i checked every pocket of my bag and my own pocket if its there but its gone. Im shaking and have a very few time to think on what to do. Should i go home? Should i check the jeep maybe i left it? Should still go to my girlfriends house? Every thoughts rushed in my brain to what to do, every thing happens so fast, Im already thinking on what would my parents say if i lost my phone what would happen to me what should i do. \n\nBut then i tryed to retrace my steps, note that i never bring out my phone from my bag the whole time on the jeep. So the guy that i mentioned which was behind me i think of him all a sudden then look around then i see him walking on the opposite side of the footbridge a bit far from me already and i saw that he glanced at me and i saw him holding a black phone in his hands which is my phone has a black case. I suddenly had the urge to follow him but i dont want to assume that he stole my phone but i just want to asked him, yet im not commited to following him so i stoped in the middle of the foot bridge to look around panicking or trying not to panick. When i tryed to look for him again at the bottom of the footbridge he is gone. Thats where a random lady a vendor at the side of the footbridge told me with out questioning me she just said he went inside the blue jeepney and without a doubt my blood rushed through my veins as i runned and jumped all they way down the foot bridge without thinking about my injury and what would happen to me luckly inside the jeep there is one or two people including the guy inside sitting hiding in the corner so i saw him immediately and as i got near the jeep i shouted MAGNANAKAW which is thief. And then i saw his face shocked and scared and he threw my phone away and jumped out the jeep. As he threw my phone i didnt get a hold of him because i catched my phone and he ran towards in the middle of the highway and not seeing him again i guess he got scared cause im a pretty big guy \n\nBut anyways i stepped out the road a lot of people looking and feeling glad that i got my phone and i realize that im trembling hard my knees and hands are shaking and i cant move. Some people asked me what happened and after like 10mins of trying to catch breath i thanked the lady vendor that told me where he is i didnt know how she knew but im thankful i asked if she has gcash(online wallet) so i can give her a reward but she doesnt have so i just took her number after and i continued my day going to my girlfriend's house \n\nNow today july 4 i barely cant sleep, when i closed my eyes everything flashes back. Even when im not closing my eyes the whole thing flashed in my head, thinking of what would i have done if i catched the guy think of violent intents to do with the guy, recreating the scenes in my head. My heart races still and feeling of the blood flowing through my vein to my hands think of wanting to k*ll him. Every thoughts of what ifs is flowing in my mind. Having realized that i almost got robbed feels like a dream or in the movies that i cant believe it happend to me. But im really glad i got my phone back, but still would really want to beat the shit of that guy maybe i wont forget his face or maybe i will. I dont know",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm seeking some advice and support regarding an issue that's been affecting my life for quite a while now. Growing up, my stepdad was extremely abusive to me and my two sisters (now 20F and 21F). His abuse was not only physical but also mental and verbal, which severely impacted our ability to socialize, express emotions, and trust others. \n\nFor me (24M), this has made it particularly difficult to be around men. The trauma from those years has left a lasting scar, and I find myself constantly on edge or uncomfortable in male-dominated environments. This has hindered my social life and made it challenging to form new friendships or connections with men.\n\nWhen I turned 18, I started smoking weed, drinking alcohol, and vaping as coping mechanisms. These habits were my way of dealing with the pain and stress, but they also led to other problems, including a strained relationship with my mom. At that time, she didn't divorce my stepdad, which made me feel betrayed and unsupported.\n\nThankfully, things have improved in some ways. My mom eventually divorced my abusive stepdad and has since remarried a wonderful man who treats her‚Äîand us‚Äîwith respect and kindness. This has helped mend my relationship with her significantly. However, the lingering effects of my past still haunt me, especially when it comes to interacting with men.\n\nI'm looking for advice on how to continue healing and overcoming this fear. Has anyone else dealt with similar experiences? What strategies or resources have you found helpful in learning to trust and socialize again? Any tips on dealing with the aftermath of childhood trauma would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this.\n\nTL;DR: Abusive stepdad during childhood has left me (24M) with trauma that makes it hard to be around men. I turned to weed, alcohol, and vaping at 18 to cope, which strained my relationship with my mom. Things have improved since she remarried a better man, but I still struggle with socializing and trusting men. Looking for advice on healing and overcoming this fear.",

He could have administered techniques such as EMDR, but never did. He was \"leading me on\" and had no intention to help me at all. He was only there to take the money from the organization who was paying for the therapy sessions.\n\nIs there anything I can do to feel better? I literally stay up at night thinking about this.

    "selftext": "Hi. I'm 23. I have low/no desire to do anything. I've been killing my attention span and willpower for the past 5 years or so. I'll just mention whatever feels relevant in no particular order.\n\n\nI've always felt a bit different socially speaking, I noticed this when I started high school. I didn't really do anything outside of class. I repeated high school year three times. I used to randomly screm in class a few times every day, I stopped around 16yo. I also ate paper around that period and later on. Paper, napkins. \n\n\nOutisde school I spent my whole day online playing games, scrolling, masturbating to pornography, eating junk food. I still do.\n\n\nSo as I kept failing and being kind of socially awkward, by 2020 I had really isolated myself. I was 20. Started smoking and loving weed, smoked like a gram per day, stopped, started again, etc. From that point onwards up until today I went hard on the degeneration, I had no school now which meant more free time to play, masturbate, scroll, etc. Drugs were a plus. Fantasizing about girls giving me attention. But that was the extent of it, fantasy. Daydreaming about building social circles, doing stuff.\n\n\nNot long ago I had quite a realization, an epiphany if you will, that showed me how much repressed emotions I had. I always thought I was \"just a loser\", \"just low self esteem dude\", \"just awkward with people\" etc etc but that day I understood it's not a random thing, we are shaped by our childhood. I realized my father figures were on the abusive side. I lived with fear in my own home since 10/11 years of age and obviously learned to repress that and live with it, pretending I wasn't afraid of my dad. But it's all there, I resent my family for not doing much against it, I'm awkward with people, I don't seem to get them. My empathy is so low but on the rare occasion I manage to ignore my coping mechanisms, I burst out crying. I have so much repressed anxiety ANGER, shame, guilt, etc. \n\nI just KNOW that underneath all the repressed stuff is something good, I remember feeling more energized, smarter, more clarity in my brain, charismatic, funny, etc etc. I had a few good days where the baggage was dropped and I felt like this and Realized it was my actual true self, my nature. But the energy quickly drops, I suppose that it all goes into sheltering my ego from the repressed trauma/emotions.\n\n\nI'm very selfish (and yet, like with the rest of problems, I feel this conflicts with me because deep down I don't belueve myself to be selfish, I help out and act from my heart when I'm on my rare \"good days\"), rarely doing things for others, always thinking about how I look, how my actions look, to appear confident, etc. I struggle to see women as anything but sexual creatures, constantly craving their validation and attention (not necessarily sexual). \n\n\nI don't feel like I know myself. I've always felt my connections with people were superficial and now I know it's because my connection with myself is superficial. I'm just not there.\n\n\nI could go on but I think this enough lol. So to get to the point of this post:\n\n\nI'm not doing what I know can help me. This realization about having tons of repressed emotions showed me that it'd be a very good first step to start therapy, psychoanalytic and/or somatic (The Body Keeps The Score stuff always made sense to me), and go from there but I'm just NOT doing it. I keep saying aight this week I'll definitely look up good professionals close by and visit a few to start the process of finding one I like, but no. I spend the day scrolling youtube, twitter, reddit, etc. Playing game, pornography, cigarette. I know meditation can help but God forbid I spend any anount of time without stimulation. I'm getting more and more irritated by my family when they ask for stuff, which has taught them to leave me alone in my room which breaks my heart. But I cringe and resist opening up to them.\n\n\nI crave compassion from outside, like some benevolent stranger showing they understand me and that they believe in me, knowing I can heal and grow. Is this actually my desire for SELF compassion projected onto other people? Is my apparent lack of belief in myself causing me to look for others to believe in me? \n\n\nI'm just tired. I know I CAN keep going like this, I'll just really regret it, but right now I can avoid that feeling because I still \"have time\". I've always fantasized about that, \"having time\" and turning into a winner... But next week. Or next month, right now I just keep watching YouTube and playing Brawl Stars.\n\n\nI know that despising this behaviours and just brute-forcing my way out of procrastination is not the way, that's why I consider  some kind of therapy to be the first step I should take. \n\n",

    "selftext": "I once trusted my parents and many others, but I was badly hurt because of it, and now I have trouble trusting anyone.\n\nAny advice on how to learn to trust again?\n\nTo give more details, I was raised to implicitly trust authority figures. With anything and everything. And I did. Until I was about 18 I was willing to trust any sort of authority figure with my life. \n\nThis includes my parents. I would do anything asked of me, anytime. I was willing to dedicate my life based off what was asked of me.\n\nThen I served a Mormon mission, and got hurt bad, emotionally. I was vulnerable and placed my wellbeing in the hands of a religious leader, and he did not take care of me. My mental and emotional wellbeing tanked, and I had a hard time understanding what happened. I didn't understand how I could've been burned, I viewed authority figures as infallible.\n\nThat brings me to now, a couple years later, and I still have trouble trusting anyone. And deciding if they are worthy of my trust. I didn't use to need to decide, I just gave it willingly to anyone who wanted it. I don't understand how to judge if someone is worthy of my trust.\n\nAny advice for me? I could really use it.",

    "title": "I'm really not sure if I am traumatized ",
    "selftext": "Hi, I'm new to this subreddit. I'm almost 40, female, very recently finally diagnosed with autism and trying through that perspective to make sense of my current life and mind and also my past. A Herculean task.\n\nI've seen six therapists in the past year, trying to find a good fit, and everytime they ask me what I hope to get from therapy I refine my answer a little. But I think the thing I'm looking for isn't going to come from therapy, because I think I'm probably not even traumatized I guess--I am just a hater, and there's nothing for me to \"get over\" or forgive.\n\nI've been trying to get some strategies to stop hating all the dogs that bit me (so to speak); the people who have ruined my life, the places I worked that are corrupt, etc. But it's not possible to heal from these very real terrible things that happened and continue to happen. Healing is not the strategy, here. Hating is the strategy. My brain is right to hate and avoid these situations that have proven to be very dangerous for me. It's not something I should \"get over\". It's correct to feel how I feel.\n\nI came to this sub looking for possible words to explain why I feel this way. I recently learned the word \"apostasy\" (not from here) which is pretty good, because I don't think trauma fits. Like if a tiger mauls you and you're wary of tigers then, that's fine, because it's going to happen again more likely than not because it is a literal tiger. So you need to avoid the tiger! And that's ok! And tell other people to watch out for the tiger!\n\nAnyway if there are other kinds of trauma I should be looking at I will have a look, but none of it fits my experience or feelings, which is both cool and also sucks. I'd like to stop hating everything, but I have honestly just met the worst people and been through the worst shit lol. Maybe what I feel, and my radical shift in thinking, and my emotional responses to things now, is all just because I have knowledge and experience. Not trauma, just informed. Damn.\n\nStill going to therapy though! ",

    "selftext": "I am 16m. My parent did and said some stuff as a kid that affected the way I treated people. I remember when he gave my little brother a nosebleed, or picked me up by my shirt and pinned me against the wall, or encouraged me to use my charm to manipulate others into getting what I wanted.  Or some of the other stuff he said and still does. Threats like, \"I'll break your legs\", \"I'll knock you out\", \"I'll jab you in the throat\" e.t.c. My father is a good man who did not have any easy life. He is kind, but seems to struggle with his anger. So, I did what I was shown. I did what I was taught. To people and animals. Lying about things as little as food, viewing people as less than, felt no compassion for anyone but myself, would joke about killing my little sister's dog. I killed animals because I felt empty inside and needed to feel something (I did not kill her dog and I know that sounds disgusting like something a fucking serial killer would say). I took my anger out on my brother and harmed him. I was evil. I hate myself with a passion. I can't move on from my thoughts and my anger. I moved often as well, maybe 10 times. I often left the people I knew within a year of knowing them. I think this harmed my relationship building skills. I became lonely and escaped into my mind. On top of this I am afraid of myself. I don't want to hurt anybody. I do feel. It's just that that feeling is not always there for me. I can't get close to anybody because I don't want to hurt them and I don't want them hurting me. Because I feel that everyone is my enemy sometimes. It always seems like the nice things they do are followed by some hidden agenda. They're always out to harm me and hurt me. This lead to my dislike of physical contact. I feel isolated. I hurt so badly sometimes. I have it nice now that I live in a big house and I am grateful because it was not always this way and I have two parents, but I do not feel right in my head. There is a lot more behind these feelings that I will not put in this post, but I don't know what to do with myself. I am about to leave in 2 years. I know I will go to the military. But what will I do outside of this? I can't marry. I recognize I do not have the maturity or the mental stability for this. I don't want to end up hurting my kids or my wife. So will I always be alone? I am trapped with myself for the rest of my life. (I know I sound overdramatic)",

    "selftext": "I'm going to be as detailed as while also being vague about who this is because I genuinely am terrified of him, but I want to add context. \n\n\nIn 2020, 1 (19M) matched with another guy (supposedly 23M) on tinder. It was spring, and everyone was itching to get out of the house, so when this happened I was super excited. We talked for awhile and eventually FaceTimed a couple of times, before actually meeting up. When I ended up meeting him, the first red flag (which I completely ignored) was that he was the same age as me.\nRetrospectively, I can only guess how many years he was on tinder underage.\nEverything seemed fine at first, but he insisted that every single time we hung out, his friend who we'll call Lana, needed to be there with him. I had recently come out to my family and some friends, so I was desperate to meet guys.\nOne night, I get a call from Lana. During the call, she's just explaining to how much this guy was into me and that he liked me a lot. I was kinda weirded out that she was doing this, especially because I heard someone else in the background of the call.\nThen, she pops this question: \"So (man) wants to know why you haven't had sex with him yet?\"\"Wrong answer. You don't understand, I'm (man)'s other half, and what I say he will do.\"\n\nNaturally, instant block.\n2021 was my freshman year of college and I was going through some family stuff so I was drinking a lot. Drunkenly, I DM'd him, breaking no contact. The next morning, I realized what I did and I just ignored the messages and never replied. Also after the fact, I learned that this person I went to college with was sexually assaulted by this man.\n\nIn 2022, I get a call from a local area code with the caller ID sharing the same last name as this person. I was like wtf? So I answered it. A female voice, (who l later learned was either his sister or someone posing as his,) answered. His \"sister\" informed me that this person had committed suicide, and apparently I was one of the last people that spoke with him. (Doubt) \n\nNaturally, I am very freaked out by this and I hang up. She calls me back, and I hear people talking on the other side. She says that she's looking for closure, and I tell her I want nothing to do with it and that, frankly, he was terrible to me and I heard he was terrible to others. All of the talking on the other side of the phone stops, and I remember hearing giggling. That's when my rage took over. I hung up the phone and texted \"that was fucked up don't ever do that again.\"\nShe doubles down, saying she's not joking her brother is dead. The she starts explaining to me that Lana is a felon in prison now, and emotionally abused him for years. Then she goes on a rampage, and verbatim sends this text:\n\"You clearly had unfinished business with him. He was an amazing person good looking, stylish. He was a package deal. I'm sorry\"\n\nI've since blocked that number, and l've searched prison records and obituaries. Lana is not in prison, and he is not dead. His profile picture on Instagram has been updated as well. Anyway I just needed to get this off my chest, because the scenes from the show he was in keep popping up on my TikTok fyp. Every single time I see it, it‚Äôs like a shot to the gut because I know that person is still alive and probably still doing the same things to others. \n\n I literally still have the screenshots of the texts in the event he ever pulls something again and I get the police involved.\n\n",

    "selftext": "Gpa \nI went to school for civil engineering because that was my grandpas job and he lives a very comfortable lifestyle. Because of my criminal background, I think only the transportation department will hire me. Which seems like a joke now that I manage the $1.2 billion dollar budget. I‚Äôm not going to lie, I make shit money and am about to email the top director of the whole company to discuss equal pay (in which I did, we got a $4,500 retention bonus, I got $2,600 that I put to bills). I went to school for 6 years and did 4 years of experience for no promotional increase for getting my professional engineering stamp . Turns out civil engineering in transportation is the ‚Äúpoor man‚Äôs engineering‚Äù. Mind you, my grandpa who was a civil engineer in transportation lives in a 3,200SF home that was once supposed to support them and my mom & us 3 kids. They built a 3,200SF home for all of us to live in so my mom could go to school.  They built the upstairs for my mom & us 3 kids. A whole ass upper floor for 4 people. Living room, Master bedroom with a bathroom and walk-in closet and three more-than good sized bedrooms with bifold door closets and a full sized bathroom with 3 sinks for the the 3 rooms to share. For context we moved up here from California because mom was starting to be an alcoholic junky and dad was just an alcoholic. My mom being drunk  got into a car accident one night when she tried to drive from the casino to home but they found her trunk on the other side of the road and the rest of the car on another. She hit a power pole that knocked out the power to a small town. She was in the news that night. She tore her aorta, which is the biggest valve to your heart, collapsed both lungs, and broke all of her ribs. Turns out my grandpas father died from a torn Aorta from a drunk driver that hit him. My great grandfather was hit from a drunk driver. My mom was a drunk driver who taught her oldest child how to drive while drunk in a parking lot, my sister( and yea my sister got drunk the next day and was found in a park parking lot with the family car), mom let her drive on Shasta mountain because dad and her were too drunk to pick up the car, and one time she let her drive from her friends house (like 45 minutes away) and what do you know, my sister is dead at 20 from drinking and driving. Mind you we share a birthday 2 years apart on the same day. So 4 days from my 18th birthday and her 20th birthday. I had to bury my sister. At around my 7th grade year, mom went back to crackland as she did so many times before when living in California. Well after mom abandoned us  3 kids at our grandparents, she went off to crackland  for about a year or longer. And then begged us to come live with her.  While we were at our  grandparents, me and my sister started to receive a $25 allowance once a week each. My sister took both of our allowances and would get us an eighth of weed. But then she would proceed to smoke with all her friends instead of me. I didn‚Äôt really mind because I was such of a lightweight. I also liked meeting new people like her friends because I didn‚Äôt have any of my own.  After about a year, in which time my dad was chasing my mom‚Äôs crazy tweaked  out ass all over town she stole his keys and made him call a locksmith because she wasn‚Äôt done partying. After a couple weeks he was arrested with his millionth DUI sent off to prison for 3 years and then my cracked out mom asked us to move in with her to crackland with the bribe of weed. I had runaway the end of my 7th grade. My sister contacted me and said we could get so much weed while we we‚Äôre there, so I agreed. We were living with a meth dealer who was also  a heroin addict. I was the only 1 out of us 3 kids that were pissed at my mom when I  ran away and stayed with friends, did mushrooms, smoked weed, pills, coke, you name it. I tried  meth at 13 with my boyfriend in crackland. Then my mom started supplying meth to me literally the day after I tried it. It was fun at first we would be like let‚Äôs go have a family line. And we would get to a gas station and I was like mom you have a white stuff around your nose and then I would be like mom I‚Äôm too stoned to go into the store. My grandparents would occasionally take us to see my father who was in prison for his  millionth DUI charge before we went to crackland. he was devestated the next time I saw him in Boise and told him what was going on.\nUntil one night we got raided. I wasn‚Äôt there luckily but my poor younger brother was. The cops threatened to beat him if he didn‚Äôt comply, as he was getting out of the shower (he was 3 years younger than me and I was 13/14 years old). The cops thought that my room was his. I painted a giant caterpillar smoking a hookah with my name under it, I know stupid people exist in every profession. After the raid we tried to go to Mexico, my mom sent my brother to live on a cattle ranch with my aunt and uncle. We tried to go to Mexico by selling some cars but the Mexican mafia got wigged out because there was a lien on my moms car and ended up beating the heroin addict up and taking our only car with all of our clothes in it. My mom went back to my grandparents the next day and I explicitly told her I would not be going with her. The next day my grandparents showed up with SWAT at the hotel room. At first, I panicked and looked for a place to hide. At no avail, I realized I needed to get my shit out of there and leave before my sister got caught too. I didn‚Äôt see her for like a month after that. I was back at my middle school for 8th grade, the gym teacher commented on how lean I had gotten. Little did he know it was because of the meth. Back in 6th grade at the same school I was on honor role, weird how shit happens. Mom was eventually charged with something that gave her probation at which time she got us a rental house. 9th grade I went to a charter school on a lottery scholarship. One day an incident happened and I was charged with assault on an officer and obstruction of delay, at one of my sisters friend‚Äôs apartment. From that day forward I was on probation. While at the rental with my mom, me, my sister, and my brother lived in she would call my probation officer on me frequently for being stoned. I ended up going to an in care patient rehab facility for 3 months. I told my charter friends I went on a cruise. After rehab my dad got out of prison with no driving privileges so my sister drove home to his hometown state of Minnesota. I wanted to go there too and had them take most of my belongings with them. Sophomore year I got caught stealing a backpack with car keys, found the keys, and stole stuff from the car. My probation officer was so fed up with me she let me off probation if I wrote her an essay. When I went to court I told him I had planned on moving to Minnesota. He told me I had 24 hours to get a t plane ticket. In which I did. ",

I'd love some advice from anyone who's been in the same boat or has any suggestions.\n\nI have a hard time processing my emotions in the moment and staying regulated, so things tend to simmer under the surface. More often than not, my partner will notice my underlying state even before I do and gently prompt me to talk to him which results in me either (1) involuntarily regressing with him or (2) venting angrily to either him or a crisis hotline and then regressing.\n\nNo judgement please. I've done a lot of work to manage my involuntary regressions/non-verbal episodes alone. I surround myself with comfort items and activities, and my partner is all around just comforting and supportive of me. If I end up in that state, I'm confident I can take care of 'baby' me until the storm's passed. It's the angry side of me that I'm struggling to handle.\n\nI don't want to isolate myself and slip into the same unhealthy, self-destructive behaviors I used to turn to when I'm feeling this way. But it's not fair or sustainable for me to pour everything onto my partner. And sitting for over an hour on hold in a heightened state, waiting to vent to an overworked hotline worker while there are hundreds of other people who need the service isn't working well either.\n\nNo matter who I vent to, it pretty much goes the same and once I start I have no brakes. I try to keep it light and on track, talking a bit about what's currently going on but that somehow ends with me listing complaints and anxieties and insecurities. A lot of unrelated childhood situations that I've already put to bed end up in the mix for some reason. If it's particularly bad, I'll be incoherent and sobbing until at some point I end up regressing to a more controllable state and then I fall asleep/let my partner take care of me until I feel better/slowly pull myself back together.\n\nI can't afford actual therapy (time- or cost-wise) and I've tried journaling, going to the gym, distracting myself with hobbies I enjoy, breath work, and more. It all feels just forced and peformative even though I'm doing it alone for myself, and it doesn't help reduce any mounting underlying frustration. I think part of me is afraid to let myself process anything until I'm supervised- as awful as that sounds. \n\nIt's exhausting and I need some better tools or to modify what I'm already doing somehow.

I don't blame her, since our mental health system is so grievously broken. She's been diagnosed with BPD and other identity disorders. \n\nI think she regrets bottom surgery, but would never say so. She didn't follow instructions and her surgery has... Created more complexity, physically. She's upset but has no one to understand and talk to. She only trusts her other trauma druggie friends. \n\nDo I just sit back and let it play out? Do I try to get involved? I'm afraid I'll lose my sister, a parent, or both.

    "selftext": "Hello! I have been in therapy for a while now and it is not always the best, but I try to keep focused on my goal. I wrote down something that I keep thinking about and helps me a lot go through the difficult times. Maybe it will help someone else? I have no idea, I used to write a lot, now it's hard to get back to it, so thank you for the time.\n\n\nI think of life and our minds like a ball of yarn. Some people's yarns are neat and rolled perfectly in a ball, others have some knots around, but still managable. Then some people like us, our yarns are a mess. They have knots and are tangled and as much as we tried rolling them into a ball, it just doesn't work the same way. We see others with nice yarns that they now use to make scarves and hats and maybe jumpers, while we wonder why we have all these knots in ours. Truth is, these knots are just there, it is not our fault and it is not fair, but we have to detangle it if we wanna use it. So a therapist helps us in that. We start unfolding the ball of yarn and we start fixing the knots. That is why therapy has so many highs and lows, I think. Sometimes a knot is easy, so much we are shocked at how we did not figure it out sooner, others are complicated and take time and patience we might not always have at the moment. Then we find ourselves sat on the floor with an unfurled ball and yarn all over the place, still with knots, wondering what the hell we are doing. But you can't get to these knots if you don't unfold the whole yarn. So we just keep going fixing the knots and as we detangle this mess, we start rolling our ball of yarn again into place. Sometimes we will have to undo it again to get it right, but then slowly we will see the nice and tidy ball of yarn form. We will finally get to learn how to knit or crochet and make our scarf or hat or whatever we like. And this time I also believe will be crucial, because we will see people our age walking around with the hats they already made. We might feel behind because we on the other hand have barely started yet. However, while they were knitting with their yarns that were ready, we were in the mess figuring out how to get that yarn in the first place. So let's not be ashamed of not having a scarf yet, because that ball of yarn we have, is a work of art in itself and we have time. And I imagine that while making our scarves we might find once again a knot here or there that we missed, and we will look at it with patience and detangle it as we did hundreds times before. Then we will carry on with our day and keep knitting our piece. Not fazed by a small knot, because we remember when the floor was a mess of yarn, that same yarn, we didn't think would ever get into place. And yet, there we are, making something out of it.",

    "selftext": "This isn't a question, but today I feel a strong urge to share something with someone. Unfortunately, I can't find that person in real life, so I've decided to write it here on this platform.\n\nLet me start from the beginning. I've carried a lot of mental trauma and a very difficult life since childhood. Suicidal thoughts have haunted me since I was in the 5th grade.\n\nI wasn't good at studies or making friends. My shyness and anxiety made it hard to connect with others at school. My classmates and even some teachers bullied me for being a slow learner. This left me with very few friends.\n\nThings spiraled even further in the 5th grade. On top of everything else, I lost someone very special to me ‚Äì my Nani (maternal grandmother) ‚Äì which came as a huge shock. Then, during my mid-semester exams, I scored extremely low marks, some even in the single digits. That day, I made a decision to jump from a building. I even planned how to do it. But then, suddenly, I got an eye infection that forced me to put my plan on hold.\n\nAfter a while, I managed to make some friends, and life smoothed out for a bit. Unfortunately, the good times didn't last. My father's business faced a huge loss, leading to bankruptcy. This significantly impacted his mental health. He became more aggressive and narcissistic. The environment at home grew toxic, with major arguments erupting at least once a week. This drove other family members away ‚Äì some ghosted us entirely ‚Äì because of my father's abusive behavior. He took his anger out on everyone, even blaming his problems on his own brother, my uncle, who eventually left him.\n\nYears later, with immense effort, we managed to overcome those problems. Just when I thought it was over, life threw another curveball ‚Äì COVID-19. My father lost his business again, and his ego prevented him from finding new work. He remains unemployed to this day.\n\n2022 brought yet another tragedy. My father lost his older brother, someone he looked up to, to COVID. This devastated him, and he began blaming everyone for his situation. We couldn't afford my college education, food, or anything else. Despite having assets like a house and a car, we couldn't sell them due to unforeseen circumstances.\n\nAs my father's behavior became increasingly violent, I fell into depression and started pushing everyone away. This was a terrible mistake. I pushed my best friend away, stopped hanging out with him, and wouldn't answer his calls when he tried to reach out. I never confided in him about what was going on.\n\nThings went from bad to worse. My father's behavior deteriorated further. Then came the darkest day of my life. We were supposed to sell a piece of land ‚Äì a chance for a fresh start, a way to have money and fix everything. But of course, fate had other plans. During the deal, my father had a mental breakdown and beat up a person with whom he had a long-standing dispute. This landed him in jail ‚Äì a humiliating first for our family. The fear and stress kept me from sleeping. The land deal fell through, leaving us even more broke. We had to rely on others for money, and my mother even had to sell her gold jewelry, a gift from her late mother.\n\nSince my father's release from jail, he's become a monster again. The suicidal thoughts are back, but I can't take my own life because of my mother. However, I still carry rat poison with me, just in case I gather the courage one day.",

    "title": "Mutism When Triggered - Advice",
    "selftext": "TW: sexual trauma\n \nHey everyone, I‚Äôm making this post in search of finding someone else who has either experienced this (I‚Äôm sorry if this is the case because it‚Äôs traumatic in and of itself) or who might understand what is going on with me. \n\nSo, back in September of 2023, in the last month of our relationship, my ex (22M) and I (21F) had sex - it was one of those situations where I was left feeling used, like I was there to serve a purpose. It began mutual, but during there was no consideration of my needs, followed by no aftercare or intimacy. Shortly after, he drove me home. As seconds passed, I felt body shut down, specifically my mouth. He tried to ask what was wrong, and I was trying to find the words - but it felt physically impossible for me to open my mouth. \n\nI could move my fingers and my brain was functioning, and when he would ask me a question I could even respond in my head, but I could not muster a sound let alone words. I went completely mute. After he dropped me off at my apartment, I continued to be mute and fell into a state of panic. My roommates witnessed it, and I wanted to scream for help but my jaws felt like they were glued together and on fire at the same time. I felt so confused, guilty and embarrassed that this was happening.\n\nI texted my ex exactly what I was experiencing, and he came over with his Nintendo switch and some food because I hadn‚Äôt eaten all day. It took about 1.5 hours from the time he got to my apartment to physically be able to talk again. The process of being able to speak again started with my jaw slowly unclenching, and then trying to calm myself and not force words that just weren‚Äôt coming out. I communicated with him through writing to him on my phone, and he responded out loud. We didn‚Äôt really talk about it after that and shortly thereafter broke up.\n\nFast forward to tonight. I had a quickie with my current boyfriend (29M) in the backseat of his car, and it was one of those neighborhoods with a ton of cops so the risk of getting caught was high. We both had agreed ahead of time we were just going to have a spontaneous, raunchy experience since we were feeling a little adventurous. Shortly after we finished, he put his clothes back on and hopped in the front seat. I knew under any other circumstance (ie. not in the car where we could be caught any second) he would have snuggled me right up - but this time he was worried about the cops and wanting to get the hell out of there. \n\nNevertheless, my body had the same physical reaction as before. My jaw tightened to a painful level, I couldn‚Äôt unseal my lips, I couldn‚Äôt make a sound. I went onto my notes app and explained to him that this happened once before, that it was highly embarrassing for me, and it wasn‚Äôt his fault, but I did get triggered. He gave me tons of reassurance, apologised for triggering me, and then let me sit in silence in the car as we played lofi tunes. Within 25 minutes I was able to speak again, we talked and hugged (and snuggled) through it all, and I feel physically fine now. \n\nBut my mind is going crazy, if I‚Äôm being honest. This is the second time now that I have lost complete control over my body‚Äôs natural functions. I am wondering if it has to do with past trauma. For context, when I was in middle school, I was sexually assaulted by oral penetration. \n\nIf someone could please just offer me a little help here or an explanation that would seriously be a huge help. Thanks for reading all of this, and if you‚Äôve ever experienced something similar, I know it‚Äôs absolutely terrifying, but you are not alone. \n\nTLDR: I became completely mute for after getting triggered during/after sex on two separate occasions, 9 months apart, with two different partners.

My stepmom is in no way perfect but I don't blame her for being scared of him when he's like this. I tried to explain to him that my stepmom hasn't known him long and that any woman would be scared of the way he expresses sadness. \n\nThis usually happens 3 times a year, typically after seeing something triggering. He USUALLY just spends the day moping and refusing to eat with one anger outburst at the end of the day but this time the trigger was VERY bad. I won't get into it but it's very personal to his trauma and not something a normal person would understand.\n\nHe's suicidal and wants to divorce my step mom and leave California. I don't want that because I've been around him when he's lonely and it's very difficult. He has a life insurance policy on himself and thinks if he kills himself we'll forgive him just because we get money but I don't want money. I just want him to be okay and stable. I liked my stepmom for him because he's more responsible when he has someone he's trying to impress and she's hard to impress so he's been extra good since being with her. Now he just resents all the changes he had to make for her because he can't see that he's much better off with her. He's convinced she can't understand him and wants to leave her. I'm afraid he'll just self-destruct without her and we won't know how to deal with it.\n\nHe has been venting with his childhood friend with similar trauma for an hour and seems to have calmed down but I don't know what to do about the anger towards my step mom. \n\nMostly just venting but if anyone can give me advice please do.",

    "selftext": "I‚Äôm 25/female. Also if it helps I am fairly certain I have autism. \nToday I virtually attended my 27 year old friend‚Äôs funeral. She died of severe and enduring anorexia. \nI have attended a trauma group for 3 years and that‚Äôs where I met her. She and I exchanged stories about our childhood trauma. Her stories were so vague. I don‚Äôt know who molested her at an extremely young age but that was one thing we had in common. She was a difficult person honestly. But also I think there was so much her family missed about that and it makes me angry. They say if genetics are the gun the environment pulls the trigger- and I believe that.\nThe reason I joined that group:\n-My mom was molested by her aunt‚Äôs husband. My dad and grandma knew. My parents cut contact with the aunt pretty much. Until I had colic and my parents lost so much sleep and were probably feeling guilty and persuaded- that they decided it would be okay to let me and my sister stay the entire weekend at their house. I have no idea when my great uncle first molested me. And I know it happened a lot. We stayed there so much. \nBut I didn‚Äôt grow up knowing. my first memory for the longest time was looking at my great uncle in his casket. He killed himself when I was 4. When I was 19, I was at my family‚Äôs house talking to my mom in the kitchen and she for some reason told me about how her uncle, my great uncle- would ‚Äúcheck her for ticks‚Äù and when she said that phrase a flood of memories of being molested came back. I was meeting myself. I was meeting the man I had called my ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù my whole childhood. I hated it. From 4-19 this huge chunk of me was missing. \nOh! The worst part I guess is that my mom was receiving her degree in elementary school counseling while she was letting me spend weekends isolated with her uncle- who molested her.\nI won‚Äôt get into the absolute mental hell that this put me through- and still does. You either understand or you don‚Äôt. I think all the time about cutting her off because she‚Äôs not sorry. I told her that ‚ÄúI remembered _____‚Äù and she was drunk and just flatly said ‚Äúoh, I did not know that I‚Äôm sorry‚Äù and dead ass walked away. It hurt so much. Crazily, I love and forgive her. I know she loves me she‚Äôs just so broken. She‚Äôs an alcoholic, too.\n\n-In December 2020- the day I had finals.. my high school friend lost her battle to brain cancer. Her funeral was coincidentally held at my childhood church and led by the pastor I despised. \nAfter her death I was catatonic. My fianc√©e at the time- couldn‚Äôt deal with anymore of my pain. He left me a couple months after she died and we had to rehome the pets. It was tragic. \n-in feb 2018 my 26 y/o friend took a hike, tripped and fell, broke his ankle and couldn‚Äôt get out of the revive and he died of hypothermia. He didn‚Äôt tell anyone where he was going so he was missing for 10 days before hikers found him.\n\nBeing 25- having gone to so many more funerals than weddings is breaking me. I feel like I‚Äôve died with them- a lot of times. \nI think I have issues in one on one therapy because of my mom‚Äôs hypocrisy-through all that masters degree and drinking she still doesn‚Äôt think she would benefit from therapy. I‚Äôm not very trusting. \n\nDo y‚Äôall have any advice for making one on one therapy more useful for me? How do I even say/work through these things? How do you heal trauma and when does it end? Will I be depressed forever? \n\nAnyway, thanks if you made it through my small book. ",

Before that I sat on the stairs all day everyday until 7am-8pm and wasn‚Äôt allowed to do absolutely anything. One year he even made a rule where I wasn‚Äôt allowed to talk to him or my mom or even be in the same room as them for that matter. He would go out of his way to make different lunch and dinner and this went on for an entire summer.\n It only got worse as I got older in 6th grade I was caught staying up late on my chrome book , I was forced to weed the entire drive away from morning to night. This went on for about a week and a half until my neighbor screamed at my stepdad saying that was abuse. He instead moved my punishment inside where I was forced to stay up all day and night and wipe the entire house down with a bucket of soapy water and a rag. I quite literally stayed up for days straight on the weekend and was only allowed to sleep on a school night. There‚Äôs even more I could rant about but eventually I moved in with my grandma.

I am on summer break and I am currently back in my childhood room. I stayed on campus for a while and enjoyed being away and now I‚Äôm back with my parents. I struggle to live in this house. Until I moved out for college it was due to having strained relationships with my family especially my father which caused a huge mental health decline. However since I have came back they have been nothing but nice and understanding to me. I have had absolutely NO issues with my family. However I have recently found out that since coming back the new things added to my room that were not here before are apart of some ‚Äúroutine‚Äù I have created. I‚Äôve never had a routine till I came back to my families home. The box fan is always on, the lamp stays on till about ten, and watching the roku wallpaper and screensaver has become very important to me. My Roku stopped working and I flipped out. I was talking to my boyfriend about it very nicely said it‚Äôs not a big deal and it will be okay, then he suggested that maybe I am just bored. Then it hit me, the only things I keep in routine are the new things that were added to my room before I left. I was to scared to be around my family when they are home and go to my room where I have learned to cope for the past years in an unhealthy way. It‚Äôs not like I don‚Äôt want to spend time with my family. But it‚Äôs what my body and brain still thinks is best due to trauma and not wanting to put anymore strain on our relationship. Which then puts me in my childhood room where I have been at my worsts. Where I first harmed myself, snuck a drink, started vaping, had my first thought of committing and tried to go through with it, etc. This room has been my escape for YEARS, but also where I have been hurt the most. Mentally and physically. Do I sound dumb, like I am reaching for an explanation of why I hate living in this house or is this all valid? I don‚Äôt know why I am posting this or what I‚Äôm hoping to hear as a response. But thank you if you read it all",

    "selftext": "Hi,\n\nLately, I've been struggling with childhood trauma and resentment. I just wanted to share this here. Healthy coping strategies are welcome:\n\nWhen I was about ten years old, I frequently found bitter, orange granules in my sandwiches during lunch breaks at elementary school. Curious, I asked my parents about them. They explained that the granules were an experimental supplement intended to improve concentration.\n\nMy parents suspected I had ADD, a condition for which I would later be diagnosed and medicated, although I was unaware of this at the time.\n\nI felt uneasy about this situation. Without my knowledge, I was given a supplement for a condition I didn't know I had. This revelation made me reluctant to discuss the subject further, and I only mentioned it a few more times.\n\nThe realization that significant decisions were made on my behalf without my input still weighs heavily on me. When my boundaries are crossed, I experience nausea and shortness of breath.\n\nSince that moment, I haven't felt safe around my parents. I don't dare to show my emotions, express my feelings, or share my thoughts in their presence. As a result, I am always very quiet around them. Although I love my parents, my fear of them overshadows this love.\n\nIn response, I have sought love, attention, warmth, and support from others in an almost obsessive manner, often losing myself in the process. I frequently visited friends' houses to observe how their parents interacted, placed people on a pedestal, sought mother figures in younger women, became allergic to family conflicts, and developed an intense fear of abandonment. Additionally, I became addicted to drugs, using them to feel safe‚Äîsomething I am now recovering from (113 days of clean time).\n\nOver the years, I've developed resentment towards my parents, particularly my mother. This resentment stems from the initial incident and her continued behavior of crossing my boundaries and dictating what I can and cannot do. Spending time with her often leaves me feeling off balance. Despite being twenty-eight, such interactions make me feel like a ten-year-old boy again. Since overcoming active addiction, I‚Äôve experienced heightened resentment, possibly because I used substances to numb these feelings before. \n\nNow, as I progress through the fourth step of a twelve step program, drafting my resentment list is a confronting task, but it helps me understand why I feel incomplete.\n\nI recognize that I am not ready to have this conversation with my parents, especially my mother. I‚Äôm unsure if it‚Äôs a conversation that ever needs to take place.\n\nMy hope is to find peace and calm through a combination of therapy, step work, and possibly, eventually, a conversation about my resentment. This process will help me heal and create a more balanced state of mind.\n",

If it's my money, it's no problem, but when it comes to me buying myself food out or essentials, if I can't afford it for the other people in the house, I just don't.

    "selftext": " am very attached to a toxic friend I have had most of my life. I grew up with my mom and I only saw my father a few days a month. I was never close with family members because they either suffered from mental issues or drug abuse on both sides so I was kept away for safety reasons. I remember having self harm thoughts around second grade and would imagine hurting others or I would hurt myself. I met my friend in early grade school and had to be her friend. At the time, girls were not into video games or nerdy subjects, so to find another girl that liked similar things was a bonus. We both had troubled families and liked similar things. We began obsessively writing rp (roleplay) where we could be our own characters and have perfect lives with these characters we loved and be together. I noticed how much she loved her male fantasy characters, so I started having a sexual relationship in late grade school with her. We were the same age and kept it a secret. I'm not sure why because I'm not gay but i think I just wanted to feel loved snd important to someone. Even if I had to pretend to be someone else.\n\nWe stayed friend a long time until a death in her family drove her to drop me as a friend. While she spiraled out of control with her life she would often be my friend just to drop me again. Any time she had a boy friend or a friend she seemed to forget about me. She would show little to no interest in my life. She did not come to my wedding, she did not come to my baby shower, etc.  Through most of this we keep rping. Though we do not get along in real life, she acts completely different in rp. In rp she is the perfect friend I want but in real life she can't. I do everything for her. I give her anything she wants and visit her constantly but she never returns it to me. She can't act loving or caring towards me but in rp  she can. We both thrive and live off rp to stay calm in life because that's how we grew up, but rp is almost a tease to me\n We fight so much because I do all the work in the friendship that she insults me etc but she never quits rp.  Is this a form of control? I've told her that I love her and care about her very much but I don't think she feels the same about me. I'm in a relationship now and have weird reaction to having sex. Whenever I have sex with my boyfriend it's fine and normal but when it's over I break down and cry because my brain likes to remind me.of when i was young and intimate with my friend just to know they never cared about me. \n\nI know this is a lot but I did my best to make this as short as possible. This issue bothers me everyday for other 10 years. I constantly cry and hate myself and even hinted suicide to her and it dosnt bother her. I am constantly stoned so I can try and ignore how hurt I am from her. My boyfriend thinks I view her as a much better person than who she really is because I want a friend.",

It's like you want me to come to you with not only the problem but the solution. I'm a child, if I had the solution, I would come to you with it, but I don't. So can you help me? Sometimes I wish for a padded room. So I could be myself and not have to worry about hurting myself or anyone else. And then it's like people are like, ohh, well maybe if you just came out of your room more. Maybe if you came to me more. First of all, if you want me to come out of my room more, maybe create an environment outside of my room that I'd actually want to be in or be a person I wanna be around. Second of all, you can't complain about the specific ways I spend time with you and then not try to spend time with me. I'm making effort to spend time with you. Where is your effort to acknowledge me at all!? \n\n\n\nAnd I'm tired of feeling like I can't open up people in the real world and my real life about how I feel. And then every time I try, I stop myself because I worry that they're gonna look at this version of me that is the actual me and recoil completely from her. I'm scared they won't believe me about the stuff I've experienced and felt scared I'll be told that I'm too young and naive to even know what these feelings are like. But I look around me and I'm more emotionally complex than mostly adults I'm surrounded by. I made myself shower yesterday, which was pretty good for me I guess. But it was so much work, just getting myself to be able to do that. My main method of dealing with things I experience is to disassociate. And I feel like that they're these pockets of time where it's like I haven't dealt with something or buried it so deep or I've pushed it so far from me that it's coming back in because I've pushed as hard as I can and now it‚Äôs back and it's suffocating me. But I really don't have to worry because I'll just disassociate again and push it as far away as I can along with new stuff and wait for that to come back and choke me again so I could push it away again.\n\n\n\nHmm. Sometimes I want to take care of the of the inner child in me and other times I want to hurt her. Sometimes she's the best thing that's ever happened to me, and sometimes she doesn't deserve to live. And I'm not gonna take her life because I've thought about it and I've gotten close to doing it. And I know I can't. And just even talking about these feelings feels like they're not even real. I feel like I'm monologuing a character that I'm not even me. And I mean, this is going on the¬†Internet so I might as well be monologuing a character because I'm talking to a bunch of people that will never meet me and never be able to help me. Being on Earth feels like limbo. I feel like I'm stuck in purgatory and I'm never gonna go anywhere. And it's one of those things where you keep telling yourself it's gonna get better if you just¬†do this. Just do this. You just have to keep pushing. And it gets to¬†point where it's like what the fucking point? I don't know if these words will make sense to anyone else but I feel like bravest coward alive. I feel like all of my accomplishments amount to nothing. They're not celebrated or praised, they're forgotten and brushed under the rug. And as¬†soon as I‚Äôm given little tiny pat on the back for them that‚Äôs it. I was told I'm smart, that's where I put myself worth. What I get, what I barely get from it when I get older from it is not enough. It's not enough. But I don't know how to function any other way. \n\nFor some people, COVID was something that they'll forget, just a blip in time.  For me it happened at a very bad time and ended at an even worse time. But the rest of the world it‚Äôs like it¬†didn't happen. But what do I know, I‚Äôm just some stupid fifteen year old girl who hasn't had enough life experience for anything she feel to be real and valid. An ex-christian told to find god as her only bit of advice. Well, fuck your god. Because if he made me like this, and you‚Äôre right and he‚Äôs real, I‚Äôll kill him. Nobody deserve to feel how I feel, to have big emotions flash by in a second only to be buried and have them resurface to suffocate you at the most inopportune time. To physically shake with anxiety and have all warmth leave her body. There‚Äôs more but these feelings are too big right now and I don‚Äôt drink, smoke, or swallow so I‚Äôm gonna go eat¬†a crap ton of candy and disassociate. Have a great dayüíï. ¬†",

I‚Äôve dropped at least one pant size and my gut is suffering. I‚Äôm already anemic and having to take iron pills. But I‚Äôm still so tired all the time. The thing that‚Äôs being recommended to me as a solution is meal replacement shakes. But that‚Äôs one of the things my mom often bought for me to not so subtle hint that I needed to eat less. She always have chocolate shakes in the fridge for me and that‚Äôs what I‚Äôd have before school. If I was constantly running behind and needed something quick to go I‚Äôd understand needing it then. But I wasn‚Äôt. I always had time to eat breakfast. And if I decided to eat instead of having a shake she‚Äôd question me on it. Eventually that lead to me feeling bad about eating. And the only reason she quit buying them was because my dad ended up between jobs and the shakes were not cheap. I don‚Äôt know what to do now. Getting the shakes again is not a bad idea. It‚Äôs better than not eating anything or only eating junk. But the idea of it takes me back to that time of my life. This was actually one of the first things that she did that lead to my eating disorder. I hadn‚Äôt thought about it in years. And now here we are and I might actually need these shakes. ",

    "selftext": "Curious how others manage when you get triggered or hurt by perceived rejection in friendships.\n\nI'm currently on a vacation with a newish friend (we became friends at work about 2 years ago, have been close texting/calling friends for a little over a year and a half and we go for dinner/drinks often when we are in the same town because we live on opposite sides of the country). We traveled to the Caribbean for a total of 4 nights. First two days were GREAT! Lots of fun, lots of laughs. Day 3 wasn't bad but our plans for the day got kind of thrown for a loop, we did some aimless wandering and were hot and tired trying to find a restaurant, but ultimately it was ok. We were laughing through it for the most part. The evening was alright, we went out again but she didn't really want to party, which is fine, but i definitely could have danced all night again. Again, nothing bad but we were definitely on different pages. Went home, had some pizza and watched trash tv.\n\nDay 4, our last day things felt a little weird. She really wanted to go to the rainforest, but it was storming and trails were potentially closed, so we didn't. We got out coffee and breakfast separately, then kind of hung mostly by ourselves for the day. I went to a store I wanted to go to and took a swim in the ocean before the storm rolled in. She napped and hung out by the pool. It's our final evening now and after dinner she went to the balcony and has been on the phone for about an hour now. Probably just talking to her mother or a friend but...honestly i'm getting triggered thinking she's pissed at me and complaining to them. I'm worried she got too close, saw the real me and now regrets that we ever took a trip together.\n\nJust typing it out I can hear the irrationality in that. But it's hard for me to absorb that deeper than just a logical level, I feel nervous and slightly rejected and like I wasn't kind or fun enough during this trip. I know this is trauma and cptsd flaring up but would love some support/advice from this community. Thanks y'all <3",

    "selftext": "Last year I was on the brink of offing myself due to chronic stress and food and housing insecurity. I suffered health issues like full-body rashes and significant weight loss. At that time, my girlfriend gave me the courage to ask my family for financial support. Keep in mind that my family is more than wealthy. Their response to me wanting support was that I need to work for what I want (which is exactly what I‚Äôve been doing). They refused to provide support at the time I needed it the most. Luckily my mother, after having an entire mental breakdown infront of her, decided to send me Hello Fresh once every two weeks. This was the most support I‚Äôve ever gotten. \n\nNow, I‚Äôm living with my girlfriend at her mothers house in another state. Before moving here, her mother promised me that she would help me get me to a good place. Of course, that didn‚Äôt happen. Now, she has a negative view on me. I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm not on a traditional route to success and my AuDHD makes me act in unconventional ways. She also says she wants me to put the work in to become successful, but I am clearly putting in the work. There‚Äôs literally not enough hours in a day to work harder. \n\nRight now, I‚Äôm planning a study abroad to Taiwan, which I already expect to drain my pockets. My girlfriend is offering to pay for my flights, help with tuition, and give me a little extra for fun stuff. This is obviously one of the best things anyone has ever done for me, but for some reason I have almost no reaction. It feels too good to be true. It‚Äôs like my brain refuses to be excited. Why would she give up so much for me to be happy? Why was it so‚Ä¶easy? I didn‚Äôt even ask her to do this but she insists on supporting me. \n\nMy perception of what it takes to get support from loved ones is obviously skewed. My own family, who has the means to support me and has raised me, believes I haven‚Äôt suffered enough to be worthy of their support. \n\nAs a result of their ‚Äútough love‚Äù, I‚Äôve developed a lone wolf mindset. I don‚Äôt see support coming from anyone but myself. This mindset takes a toll on my mental health, my progression in my career, and personal development.\n\nMy girlfriend, who has received support from her mother at a very young age, is reaping the benefits of it. It makes me wonder where I would be if I was supported. It‚Äôs hard not to be jealous. \n\nI have a few predictions as to why it‚Äôs so difficult for me to get support.\n\n1. My history\nI had a rough time in college. I failed twice and got into drug use. My parents were devastated when they found out and told me that they don‚Äôt trust me and I have to rebuild that trust with them. They could still not trust me to this day. They might think they I‚Äôll always be a fuck up. \n\n2. AuDHD\nI just act different. I‚Äôve heard that allistic people can sense neurodivergence even when we‚Äôre masking, and they don‚Äôt like it. It‚Äôs difficult to act like someone they would like, but showing my real self has way worse consequences. I also have trouble keeping a job, which is something they seem to value. Especially my girlfriends mother. \n\n3. Artistic pursuit\nI‚Äôm pursuing a career in fashion. Young artists notoriously don‚Äôt get much support from their family. But on the other hand, my girlfreind is pursuing mural art, which her mother supports greatly. \n\nI need some advice on support. I know I need support to get anywhere in life and for my own sanity and well-being. Is my trauma holding me back from receiving support from others? What do I have to change? How should I navigate this?\n",

Is there correlation between symptoms and the type of trauma experienced?**\n* **Does the location of the person affect the kind of trauma they experienced?**\n\n**I do ask about the general area of where you live (country, and if the answer is USA I ask about your region), general information about the trauma experienced, and the symptoms you experience and how it affects your day to day life. I want to make sure you know I do not ask for details, just for general information. Everything is anonymous.**¬†\n\n**I also emphasize that if you are not in a good mental space that you do not take this survey as I don‚Äôt want negative feelings to come up as a result of this project.

    "title": "The problem with therapy",
    "selftext": "I've been diagnosed with PTSD since 2006. I was 19 then and a rough break up caused my panic attacks to really become a problem. \n\n**Trigger Warning - My Background **\nTo get to the point, skip the next 4 paragraphs. \n\nMy history involves an ugly divorce between my parents which led to my mother's father being consistently inappropriate with me once we moved in. My mom was probably his first victim because she refused to believe me and was sexually inappropriate with him as well. When I was 3, I walked in on them. Very disturbing. \n\nMy mom then married a man who was cool with me until I was about 9 or 10. Then, he would obsess over me being the prettiest girl in class. When I began to develop early, he was fixated on my breasts. He treated me like a little wife and when I complained to my bio father, he went into attack mode at both of them. \n\nUnderstandably, my father was enraged but it terrified me. I began to lie to protect my family unit. The chaos from court battles continued until I was 15 and finally had a voice. I was finally able to spend more time with Daddy, but he was an alcoholic. \n\nMy life has bounced from extreme to extreme. After my first divorce, I was a single mother to a little girl. I met my husband quickly and our relationship was a whirlwind. He seemed so stable then, whereas I was deep in drama. Our relationship was stable and calm for a long time, but there were red flags that I ignored because ignoring people's red flags is what my mom trained me to do. She trained me to ignore my inner voice and forced hugs and love for my molesters. \n\n***Why I Don't Trust Therapy ***\n\nMy parents started therapy for me at 7 or 8 years old. (For context, my creepy step dad is a social worker.)  Not one therapist actually made any difference. They played board games and did nothing. I was an intelligent child who wanted help, but the system isn't designed to be helpful. \n\nI went to another therapist. She told me about all my addictive and messed up thoughts and basically shamed and scolded me for them.\n\nYet another therapist began me on antidepressants and wanted to hug me all the time. Needless to say, I was outta there. \n\nThe list of attempts to get better goes on. My final attempt was a trauma specialist who I paid $120 to $180 per session for out of pocket. She studied in Cambridge under Bessel Van Der Kolk. She listened well, did EMDR, and was lovely. But I described the unlivable situation I'm in. All she told me was that as I got healthier, my husband and I would drift farther apart. \n\nThat line was a trigger for extreme depression. When I asked for solutions or ways to handle things, she left me empty handed. She told me to do these exercises. They basically did nothing. I spent $15, 000 in two years trying to get help. Instead, I'm still very poor (living hand to mouth) and I'm almost always in crisis. \n\nMy husband won't let me leave. I work and he doesn't. We lost our jobs during covid and he never was able to get hired, but he also won't humble himself to take a lesser job. It also involves affordability because if he makes less, we still have to pay for child care. I'm supporting a family of 4 on a single massage therapist income.\n\nHe says he's depressed. I get overwhelmed with everything and snap at him. Now, he has physically shoved me in anger and I'm mentally triggered back to emotional war with my physically abusive ex husband. I can't unsee his hatred for me. I can't pretend anymore. I can't leave because we're so poor and I have no family to go to. His family hates me.\n\nWhen will therapy adopt coaching principles? When will they properly vet people becoming therapists? When will mental health become affordable? There are so many things wrong with the system that I'm tempted to let my demons off their leashes and let them deal with the monster they've all created. \n\nI'm trying a 12 step program, but the religious undertones trigger me. My abusers were \"good Christians.\" How am I expected to trust?\n\nI've written a book about my life because I thought it would be therapeutic and so many people told me I should write the book. People find it interesting, I guess. I was hoping the end of the book would be about me finally getting the help I need and seeing and feeling real progress in my life. Instead, it seems the end of the book is a call to action. The future is unwritten and is what we choose to do with it. How do we choose to advocate for ourselves despite the stigmas and the lack of effective therapy? \n\nMy marriage is super damaged. I cannot escape, change it, or live in it. I'm losing my spirit. I want to engage in all my vices but I've been so controlled for so long that it seems a waste. I'm missing out on the beautiful parts of life watching my little ones grow because I'm consumed by rage. What can we do? TIA ",

    "title": "Trauma dumping (warning includes SA)",
    "selftext": "( I am a 20 F) As a kid I was always going through one traumatizing event to another. I grew up on the streets with a drug addict mother and a really messed up step father *he will be referenced as moms ex husband*. (ill get more into that in a minute) I was constantly being ripped away from the good in my life and was forced to move every 6 months to a year. Every time I started getting comfortable either my mom's ex husband would lose his job due to drug use or cps would be knocking on our door. I grew up always having to watch my back and fend for myself. Being forced to steal for necessities, food clothing etcetera. I've watched my mom get so messed up that she started freaking out and her and her ex husband got into a physical fight where she was knocked out clod with her head cracked open and I was only 10 at the time. And none of that is even the worst part. Around the age of 6 we were living in Missouri and at the time we were staying with family so all of us were crammed into one room. My mom's ex husband was, let's just say starting to get way to friendly with me any time my mother was out of the house. We ended up moving allot after that but no matter where we were he would still find time to do those things to me. By the time I finally got away from him it wasn't because anyone found out but it was because my mother realized I was being physically abused by the woman who owned the place we were staying at. I was always to scared to tell anyone what was happening even though I knew it was wrong so I stay quiet. But even though I had left that situation things didn't get better. I was forced to live in a suburban until yet again moving and having to start new schools. In between the ages of 12 to 14 I went to 5 different schools so I wasn't able to retain the information I was being taught so I ended up dropping out of school a couple of months into my freshman year. I got into a really bad crowd and got into allot of trouble. 5 months before I turned 15 I was put into cps and at that time I thought that maybe my life would get better. I ended up being fostered by some family friends that had known me since I was a baby and moved about an hour away from the main city so I thought it was going to be a good place. After they had officially adopted me my foster father started abusing me pretty servery. He ended up having a drug addiction as well. At this point tho I was still stuck, they refused to allow my to own a phone or have any access to the internet unless it was for school since I was in an online school at the time. I hated being in group homes and being tossed around so I ended up just trying to stay as long as I could because I only had a couple of years till I was 18. So I got back into school, busted my ass off trying to graduate on time since I didn't have a freshman year and was finally on track to have one positive thing in my life. Then when I was 17 I went for a weekend to spend a few days with my bio grandparents after Christmas. By the time I returned it was December 30th and about an hour after I got home my foster father started trying to pick a fight. He then started to get physical with me again. I ended up have bruised ribs and was pretty messed up by the end of the night. I chose to leave that night while everyone was asleep. I packed everything I could in the few bags I had and at 4am before my foster father woke up for work I walked out of the door. I ran. By 7am I walked over to a trusting neighbor and begged her to drive me back to the city. I didn't have a plan nor did I have any way to contact any one I knew since I didn't have a phone and didn't know the number for anyone. So I ended up just being dropped off at a friend house not knowing if he even still lived there and just said a prayer. He welcomed me in and said I could stay for as long as I needed. I did something I am not really proud of and ended up getting into a relationship with him because I was scared that if I didn't I would have no where to live and it was winter. He ended up being very verbally abusive and after everything I had been through I had started giving up. I have contemplated taking my life many times before this but at this time everything was just to much for me to handle. Once I turned 18 I started working at an auto parts store and met someone. He was older then me by 10 years but he was attractive and he was kind. I told him my situation and he said that if I ever needed a place to stay that his door was always open so I took him up on that. I moved in with him not wanting anything romantic since I knew I needed time to heal and neither did he. He had just separated from his wife a month before I moved in. One thing led to another tho and I fell for him. He ended up cheating on me early in the relationship with his ex wife. But it's wasn't like it was meant to be a hurtful act, he just wanted his family back and to be with his daughter again since his ex wife took her from him and refused visits. He realized what he had done and came and apologized to me. I forgave him and we have been dealing with his divorce and custody battle for almost two years now. I know I have been difficult to be around and very hard to love since I never gave myself time to heal before getting into a relationship with him but I do everything I can every day to try and better our lives and to better my mentality. I just hope it is enough that I don't lose the only good thing that has ever happened to me....",

    "selftext": "So I remember as a kid that sometimes i would get in trouble for some reason or another. maybe I didn‚Äôt get a good grade. I got caught on a lie, I didn‚Äôt clean my room. Whatever. I remember always being interrogated by my parents. They would sit down on their bed or a couch, and make me stand before them and would ask me questions. Questions I didn‚Äôt know how to answer, or maybe I was scared to answer, or maybe I was to afraid to express that I didn‚Äôt understand, or maybe by the time I figured it out I was afraid that they would blow up at me for taking so long and so I‚Äôd hesitate to say anything. Afraid of getting beaten or something. Beatings and/or punishments usually followed these interrogations.\n\nAnyway, I remember that very often I would get this surreal feeling like I could feel, for instance, the left side of my body, but next to the right side of my body. Like, if you took a shape and cut it in half and moved one half to the other side. So instead of feeling like  ‚Äú<>‚Äù  I felt like ‚Äú><‚Äú I would literally feel my arm on the other side, as if I could reach to the right of my body and touch my left arm. It was such an uncomfortable experience and I only ever got it when I was standing in front of my parents for a long time, as they stared at me and waited for me to answer them. \nHas anyone else had an experience like that? Or know what that is? I can‚Äôt find anything on the internet that describes it. I‚Äôve heard of disassociation, but I‚Äôm not sure whether or not what I‚Äôve read quite encompasses my experience. ",

Long story short: heard screaming; went to investigate; saw guy bicycling away; found the woman in a very bad state; called police etc.. My room overlooks the park/empty land where it happened. Now I can't stop thinking about it. Keep staring out the window when I'm meant to be working. Feeling somehow guilty. Feel like my body is full of stress and suspicious of everyone I see on a bike thinking it could be the guy. The woman said I saved her life but I didn't at all. She actually fought the guy off and I turned up after it all happened. But her having said that makes me feel even more guilty. Any advice on how to move on or process everything that happened would be much appreciated.\n\nI also wanted to ask specifically about contacting her. Her husband turned up on the scene about half an hour after the attack. I have both their telephone numbers. Part of me desperately wants to tell her that she actually saved her own life as she fought the guy off. For some reason, I really want her to know that as I think she maybe was confused and thought I actually saved her. But I keep telling myself I should never reach out because I know that I am just going to be a big, sharp reminder of what happened forever. They will always associate me with the trauma. Any help on this from any survivors would be really appreciated also.",

    "selftext": "Trigger warning- hospital stories\nI am looking for validation through strangers once again as I think it will help me advocate for myself in real life. I‚Äôm talking to my therapist about this soon too no therapy advice please. So as of about a month ago I 21f was diagnosed with Hodgkin‚Äôs lymphoma (yes cancer, so sad, so young, let‚Äôs not focus on that part for the sake of this post.) This diagnosis comes with a bunch of medical testing and a few procedures to pretty much assess how bad this shit is. I was uneasy knowing this as I have severe trust issues with anyone I am specifically told to trust (parents, teachers, doctors) as a result from trauma.\n\nI had a surgery about two weeks ago to get a lymph node removed on my neck. Looking back I‚Äôm pretty upset about how I was treated but I‚Äôm being made to feel unreasonable because this is how everyone is treated. I made it clear to my care team that I was nervous and uncomfortable and blatantly asked for reassurance and to have the procedure explained in detail. I made it so clear that I had to understand what was going to be happening to me. A big part was that I did not want to be naked on the table but I didn‚Äôt say that specifically because I don‚Äôt expect them to accommodate that but I thought I would be able to tell if I would be exposed at any part of the procedure based on what they had to do. I just needed to know to mentally prepare.\n\nAs I‚Äôm falling asleep I realize they‚Äôre pulling down the top part of my gown and my boobs are out in the open. I just remember essentially being like ‚Äúwhat the fuck is that for‚Äù and then reminding myself that I have cancer and have bigger problems. I wake up laying down and I‚Äôm aware of what is going on but I‚Äôm very out of it. I open my eyes to look down and see that she once again pulled my gown down to remove the sticky heart monitor things that had been placed there before. There was a curtain next to me so the guy next to me couldn‚Äôt see but anyone coming from the front or the right would have been able to see me. The next day I‚Äôm examining myself in the mirror and I see tiny cuts around my incision and I ask then I‚Äôm told it is from some type of metal clamps used to hold open the part they were operating on. I cried about it off and on for the rest of the day of mostly frustration that I tried so hard to prevent the trigger of not knowing what is happening to me and it was all pointless. Now yesterday I found out they want to knock me out again and do a bunch more stuff all at once one of those being taking some of eggs to freeze them since there‚Äôs a 5 percent chance I‚Äôll be infertile after this crap. But the oncologist TOLD me this is what is happening as if I literally have no say in if I‚Äôm going to get my fucking ovary cut open. Pretty much saying ‚Äúmight as well since we‚Äôre in there‚Äù. Like that is my organ dude it‚Äôs a big deal whether you try to gaslight me that it is or not it‚Äôs a big deal so at least let me think about it. \n\nI‚Äôm freaking out because cancer is hard enough for a person with a normal amount of trauma but for me I just don‚Äôt know how I am going to survive if this is how I am going to be treated. Especially when I‚Äôm being made to feel crazy and inconvenient for having questions or concerns at all. I am trying to work with these people and my way of doing that is by wanting to be aware of what is happening and in general it‚Äôs totally fair to want to know if a private area is going to be seen by a group of old men while you‚Äôre unconscious or have extra cuts on your neck from a surgery. The people that are supposed to save me are taking the fucking life out of me. Congrats if you read all this I didn‚Äôt know what context was important so there ya go.",

    "selftext": "I met up with this guy who was once my friendly acquaintance from FB for about 3 years. He invited me out to chill, watch some shows, order food, and vibe. At 1st, I thought we were just gonna get to know each other better & kiss a bit near the end. Turns out, we were on different pages. When we got into a motel room, he sprung onto me for a kiss when I walked up closer to him. Without consent, he pushed me onto the bed & started to sexually thrust into me passionately with our clothes still on. He was intense, so I had to tell him that I was still a virgin. He paused for a bit, but continued to passionately kiss me, sexually touch my curves, & perform sexual acts onto me until he ejaculated/pre-cummed. While doing so, he tried unzipping my romper so he could touch my breast, but I pushed his hand away. He acted really self-absorbed & didn‚Äôt seem considerate or attentive towards me. Another disturbing aspect was how he seemed to have shallow emotions. While he was still on top of me, he was giving me excessive superficial flattery, repeatedly telling me how pretty I was. But in the midst of it, he‚Äôd tell me how he‚Äôd rather read a book than give a woman his attention. He also blatantly admitted that he thinks his ex probably hates him. He grabbed my hand & tried pulling it towards his crotch but I immediately pulled away. Moreover, I told him how I only have sex with the man I‚Äôm in a relationship with but he didn‚Äôt really understand that boundary & started acting manipulative, saying ‚Äúoh, now I have to do that to you now,‚Äù implying that he wants to withhold sex from me as a form of control.\n\nI immediately felt unsafe. I became unresponsive & frozen as I was staring up at the ceiling, while laying on my back with him on top of me. He noticed, then I asked him to take me home. He seemed a bit confused but agreed, then slapped my ass when I rolled off to the side of the bed. When I stood up, I was in shock & told him that I felt like I was used. As a response, he got defensive, aggressive, & deflected. He eventually became volatile & showed me that he was emotionally unavailable. He later became even more volatile, emotionally abusive, & manipulative towards me while he was driving me back home in his car. He was speeding frantically & driving recklessly after I walked away from him. He also got triggered, paranoid, jealous, & insecure since he thought I was talking to other men when I was trying to mentally escape by being on my phone. Out of bitterness, he began being disrespectful, downgrading me, & calling me an objectifying name. I felt unsafe. He used domination & intimidation to demand for a final kiss from me‚Äî I felt very overpowered by him. Out of his coercion, but also my own pity towards him (& later regret), I gave him 1. He immediately got enraged again as his eyes turned black with a fake grin, sarcastically telling me: ‚Äúaw, you‚Äôre so adorable. I just wanna take you home with me.‚Äù He didn‚Äôt care nor notice the fear & discomfort in my facial expression or body language at all.\n\nI came home with an anxiety attack, had a nightmare, & got disturbed sleep, as my slumber only lasted 4 hrs that night. \n\nCan anyone confirm whether or not I actually got sexually assaulted? Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong. It helps me to process that entire traumatic event.",

I did meet some interesting fun people because I get crazy in public. Most of them start talking to me too much and wouldn't leave me alone to train, persistently ask for my number etc which I'm glad I've learned boundaries not give it out. Also being alone does attract a lot of people who may make me feel uncomfortable. This eastern European guy when I was at the park first just asked me about fitness I replied because I didn't want to be rude, then I was not able to get rid of him. He just started talking to me in Chinese repeatedly hitting on me asking if I have boyfriend can give number blalballa ... I kinda hate it that I'm too used to ignore my emotions and feelings and don't assert boundaries... I just need to learn to accept looking like me in public is going to attract so much attention and be okay with it . My therapist used to say you live in a society where you can't behave strangely without getting strange reactions and disapproval from the members of the public. And I also expect too much other than the society does suck and people are shitty. It's okay to accept emotions that is flashing back and acknowledging it.\n\n\nI did had this strong circus acrobat guy came to talk to me. I was so rude and annoyed at yet another guy came to look and talk to me but soon found him fun to be with. He's so strong he could be my base and I could be flyer even though I'm now too tall to do that I'm 5 feet 6 now he hold me pretty securely. I never knew having someone to train with is this much fun. When he throws me around I felt  so happy and when he. Was able to give me these super flex stretch I was so high he's so strong and was able to hold me in even deeper backbend and over 200 degrees front over splits I was feeling quite delightful my body could do those I could touch my nose with my toes fr behind but when someone else does it to me it's orgasmic to push to the extreme pain. One day I may just safely reach contortionist rhythmic gymnast level of flex.\n\n\nAlso when he walks beside me I never get harassed by others so he also acts like body guard hahaha if I feel overwhelmed I'll just drag him out I feel much safer when he's around I may still get lots of looks but as long as they don't talk to me I'm good just pretend they don't exist üòÇ",

    "title": "Abnormal attachment as a cause of vicarious trauma? ",
    "selftext": "Hello everyone!\n\nSo I bet that a lot of you have already heard of the term vicarious trauma or secondary trauma. For those who didn't, here's a quick summary: basically vicarious trauma is described as the phenomenon where traumas of other people start to affect you personally. Secondary trauma is actually very similar, but secondary trauma is often described as a result of a singular event, while vicarious trauma is a result of prolonged exposure to other's suffering. But those definitions can be a bit blurry and a lot of people use them quite interchangeably, so I will stick to vicarious trauma for this post, for the sake of simplicity. \n\nVicarious trauma is mostly associated with professions that are often exposed to other people's traumas, such as therapists, paramedics, nurses, psychiatrists, even some war historians or journalists, also it can be associated with caregivers. \n\nBut due to my personal experience and story, I came up with a hypothesis that was probably never researched yet: vicarious trauma as a result of abnormal or pathological attachment toward a person. \n\nI think that people with various of attachments differences and issues can be actually more prone to developing vicarious trauma and basically \"catching\" trauma of the person that they're so intensely focused on. Whether it's people with BPD and their favorite person, limerent people, autistic people with special interest on another human being, people with partner-focused OCD, people that pathologically mirror others or just people with different attachment issues.\n\nBasically the abnormal attachment style would substitute the common need of prolonged or intense exposure that is often required in order to develop vicarious trauma. People with those types of attachments are often way more influenced by the person that they're fixated on, so I believe there is a way higher risk in order to transfer their traumas too. \n\nSo my question is: is there anyone who experienced vicarious trauma or vicarious trauma-like state under those conditions that I've just described? \n\nAny thoughts on this hypothesis of mine?\n\n[And if you would like to read my story, here it is. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/traumatoolbox/s/8qIsfYQykZ)\n(TW: holocaust, Israeli-Palestinian conflict, obsessions, mention of suicide and other difficult topics in general).",

I don't owe anybody on the street to let them being able to talk to me and harass me!\n\nwent out the day before to get food over the weekend was keep getting unwanted attention and harassment on the street, I woke up today with massive migraine and back pain from having panic attacks of being fighting mode.\n\nPeople warned me Totthengam Is horrible possible the worst part for sexual harassment. They were exactly right. I haven't even left the street corner and it has already been so much harassment and abuse.\n\nDuring last summer, every single therapy session I went to was me complaining about getting harassed by ranmdoms on the street. I was constantly angry and in fighting mode. So I could never relax doesn't matter how many coffees I have. My therapist said it's lack of boundaries. Which I agree. Really lack of boundaries/ relationships/ society function due to panic and anxiety. I was so angry and agitated from all the men trying to talk to me by making compliments on how I look or what I do to get so \"fit\", I just awkwardly smile but they would not leave me alone. It is so stressful and because I have complex ptsd I really can't handle this kind of stress and social anxiety now. I'm not sure if it's just a London thing or it's because I'm unwell now that I have sexual harassment constantly, I don't remember ever experienced this when I was younger.\n\nAlso it's because I'm east Asian, traditional we are so polite and don't want to be rude, so we are seen as easily pushover. The stereotype is all correct. I'm also one of them who don't know how to say no. When I do say no is when I get so overloaded with anger I would respond with a violent physical fight and just want to carry weapon to go out or I would not go out at all.\n\nI would get so anxious on the street or be seen in public because people look at me, and I would start to act really anxious and nervous and start to do yoga and circus to calm down, and then people would stare at me even more\n\nI am so tired and stressed. I can't function in a society alone in the street walking around unless I have a big dog or a man protecting me. Unfortunately I don't have them. I am serious considering talking to a hospital to get permission to get a guide dog so people on the street can leave me alone! And I am not even a dog person I love cats.\n\nWhen I went out to get food so many men tried to talk to me, I'm not dressed in any way that's not appropriate for the weather. The more these people start to harass me because how I look or because I dare to expose skin to get some sunlight for depression treatment the more angry I get, and the more I just want to strip naked in public because it's a revenge anger of mine. I hate it when people in public shame me for how I look. I just have an overwhelming urge to go fully nude in public and welcome all the harassment and heal the shame\n\nI'm aware perhaps other women can deal with it better than I do because they are not suffering from the same long term condition as I do. I was told just say no no no like a broken record or say please leave me alone you are making me really uncomfortable and violated. I think it's because I'm Chinese and in our culture we don't confront people like that it's seen as rude so I have a lot of trouble functioning in western society, in the street where the predators are everywhere.\n\nI get into survival mode as if I have to fight predators in the concrete jungle in London when I go on the streets. I can't imagine if I take the public transportation alone now how bad it can get in London.\n\nAlso the police dont have th√© resources to take sexual harassment and assault seriously. The previous perpetrator on the bus was never caught and the police keeps asking for my DNA which I have reservations to give due to data privacy concerns.\n\nI am so tired of living like this I just want to pack up and move to somewhere isolated or with a smaller community where I can be left alone with no stress triggers. I noticed with my condition I cannot handle any emotional turbulence and I get overwhelmed easily with anger and overstimulation.\n\nI know it's expected to be treated like this when you are weirdly behaved and dressed and can't fit into society norm.\n\nAdult social care want to see if they can help me with a carer, I can't believe I would need a carer to live normal daily life tasks. I haven't even showered or brushed my teeth and have absolutely no energy to go out and do those now, my body is still frozen.",

    "selftext": "TW: Holocaust, Israeli-Palestinian conflict, mentions of suicide and other difficult topics, trauma \n\nHello everyone!!! So this turned to be quite a long post and I know that lot of you are not going to read it to the end, therefore I separated it into more parts. But I still hope that this post will be helpful both for someone else and myself, because this is a topic that it's not usually talked about. And my case is even more unusual, so that makes everything more difficult.\n\nAlso, I'm aware that although the terms vicarious trauma and secondary trauma are often used interchangeably, there are some people that see a difference between those two terms. For the sake of simplicity, I may sometimes refer to my case simply as vicarious trauma, because that's the first label I learned and I'm used to it. I also like it more, because it sounds more general and inclusive than the term secondary trauma (for example my case would probably me more like tertiary trauma, if you want to play with words). \n\nI'm also aware that in my case it's much more difficult to give me a clear answer on whether I am actually vicariously traumatized after all. Not only that vicarious or secondary trauma is not a diagnosis itself, my mechanism of development was even more unusual, so I need to somehow count on the possibility that I don't really have vicarious or secondary trauma, although that is very unlikely in my opinion. \nI use the term more as a working title and I write this disclaimer because I want people do their research first or most ideally to talk with some professional before they diagnose themselves based solely on my story.\n\n\nSo, let's get started. \n\n\n‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π CONTEXT: \n\nIt all started when I started dating one person. I am a neurodivergent person on the asexual-aromantic spectrum, so being more intimate with someone was a quite new experience for multiple reasons for me. \nBut my brain didn't take it very well. It actually activated a cascade of quite crazy defense mechanisms in me. \n\nIt started like partner focused OCD. Not only I became hyperfixated on my partner in the pleasant ways, but my brain started to question their morals. I started to have a lot of obsessions about them, some of them were scary, controversial, some of them were crazy and even genuinely funny. The most difficult obsessions were mostly like: ‚Äûwhat if they raped someone?‚Äù, ‚Äûwhat if they did something really bad in the past?‚Äù etc., etc. \n\nAt this point my brain searched for anything about my partner that it could obsess about. \nNot only for things that my partner could potentially do in the past, but even for bad things that may happened to them. I could obsess over them being the bad one or being the victim of something. And that's important to remember. \n\nI experienced this really stressful period for about two months. I lived in constant anxiety, I wanted to tell them and not tell them at the same time so I kept most of the things for myself. I had a new obsession once every few days and that all slowly robbed me of my mental resilience. But I also started to show an immense bout of empathy towards them that I'm not quite used to in other people. Despite all of this, \nI felt a deep compassion and fondness towards them and I knew that I am willing to undergo all of this what my brain does in order to be close to them. \n\n‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π THE POINT: \n\nAnd then, one evening we were talking (we are mostly long distance, so we were actually chatting online) about quite deep things and they told me that one of their parents was actually Jewish and therefore a part of their family died in the Holocaust. This was very, very terrible for me to hear. I immediately started shaking and that night I slept really bad and needed to take a sleeping pill. This is something that actually happened few times before and one time after due to my OCD, but in all of the other times, I reached my partner and found out that my brain was simply overreacting and that the truth wasn't that wild, so I calmed down. But this was different, because you know, there's no way how you could alleviate a genocide!! So I was forced to stay with this extreme feelings. And of course my OCD itself started to search what it might obsess about on my partner's Jewishness, but that's quite a different story. (I actually believe that I have some unknown subtype of obsessive disorder, see the details on my profile). Slowly I started to realized that although I do have obsessions on this topic, there is also something deeper hidden. Something, that wasn't there before. I realized that the OCD is not my only problem anymore. \n\nAnd then, around two and half months ago, I stumbled upon the term \"vicarious trauma\" and it all slowly stared to make sense for me. \n\n‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π THE SYMPTOMS: \n\nI felt that something in me changed after the particular day they disclosed me this horrible thing that happened to their family. It went to the point where I felt unwell evertime I scrolled through photos in our chat that we sent around that particular time. Sometimes I am scrolling through the photos in our chat in order to just look at them or for nostalgy or something, and for some time I felt almost triggered when I was coming close to photos \"from that times\". \n\nThen I started to observe the constant anger and irritation. If I had anger issues before, it went to a whole new level afterwards. Do you know the feeling when your about to get your period? Or do you know how sensitive people around you feel when they are about to get their period? So imagine that feeling but for many months straight. I actually become more violent in arguments with my family as well. I started to have violent images in my head triggered by the smallest possible inconveniences. It was like very observable shift in my anger levels. I even started to wonder if it's not something hormonal or something like brain tumor in my amygdala or stuff, that definite the difference was, but then I linked it direcly to my reaction to the Holocaust talk. \n\nThen I started to observe the angst. Angst is defined as ‚Äûa feeling of deep anxiety or dread, typically an unfocused one about the human condition or the state of the world in general.‚Äù It is the feeling that many teenagers have and therefore they're so rebellious in their puberty. I actually started to feel more like a teenager than when I was a teenager. Even my music taste expanded and I started to listen to genres that people around me listened to in our teenage years and I didn't get it at that time. \n\nOf course I also started to have intrusive thoughts about those topics. When I was close to my partner, I might even get some sort of antisemitic intrusive thoughts. But this is in my case a very clearly an OCD thing. OCD latches on things that are sensitive to us and it tries to turn it against us. And yes, even unwanted racist or other hateful thoughts are quite a common part of this disorder. My OCD and my vicarious/secondary trauma are actually really related. I think my vicarious trauma stems from my intense OCD episode and then my OCD was reinforced my vicarious trauma. \n\nI also started to feel that there are sudden limits that appeared whenever I have a conversation with someone about their traumas and difficult topics. It's as if my brain started to be scared of people sharing their traumas with me, because it may happen again! I started to become more sensitive to traumatic topics and events in general, which was always pretty unusal in me, because usually I'm a person that is unable to fully emotionally empathize until they experiences the same or at least similar thing in their life themselves. \n\nAnd for quite a long time I wasn't able to talk about the Holocaust and other Jewish traumas at all. Now I can at least chat with people online about those things, but it still may drain me of my mental energy really quick. It's as if there is a some sort of mental battery or stamina that goes low very quickly when I'm exposed to those topics, mainly when I'm exposed unexpectedly. I started to show very avoidant behavior towards anything related to the trauma and I was so lucky that I didn't have to undergo all of this at the elementary school where we were learning about the Holocaust a lot. I even think that that would be so difficult for me that I wouldn't be able to attend the classes from medical reasons or something. \n\nAnd actually I experienced one particular flashback/retraumatization. One evening our relative came and told us that their partner attempted to commit suicide. The partner were physically ok, but since I'm close to that person and since it was... well, a trauma of someone else... I started to shake, dissociate and got a full panic attack in my own home, which is not that common anymore. \n\nOf course I started to be triggered around everything Holocaust related. I think my symptoms became more intense because of, yes, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. For the first time in my life I needed to set filters for words like \"antisemitism\" on my Instagram. In those times my OCD flared up again, because I started to be scared that what if someone find out that my partner is actually Jewish and they do or say something bad to them. The weeks after the conflict escalated were one of the most anxious times in my life. It was absolutely common that I was under stress that intense that I started to cry on lectures at school for three times a day. I also started to suffer from violent or even borderline suicidal ideations, because my body didn't know what to do with all the stress. \n\nI even found a coping mechanism that some people might find a bit controversial. I have a best friend that has a very dark and politically incorrect sense of humor. So we started to make dark jokes on those topics. If someone said a dark joke about the Jews or the Holocaust who is not my best friend, I would probably be triggered, but with my best friend we established a safe environment and emotional support and it was actually very healing and it helped me immensely, maily with my intrusive thoughts. He is also the only person I joked about those things with. Then I realized that there is no need to joke about it anymore, it helped me, it was my therapy tool but now I need to move on, because continuing doing those jokes just for my entertainment would be quite immoral and insensitive in my opinion, so I'm doing it less and less. This is actually one of the unexpected moral challenges that comes with being vicariously traumatized. Can you make those jokes if they help you psychologically but you're not a part of that group socially and/or culturally?  \n\nI also started to feel really protective, almost overprotective over Jewish people. That's also one of the reasons why I stayed much more nuanced when it comes to the war in the environment of mostly radically propalestian people. I know that this conflict is a very sensitive topic and actually it was a really tough moral dilemma for me because I'm surrounded by many activists, so I felt the need to take some action, but I was so deep in an intense fear of hurting someone (anyone: Jewish, Palestinian...), that I'd rather stay silent. I still doubt it was the best option in general, but it was probably the best option for me in my very specific situation, because I knew that my vicarious trauma would interfere too much if I made some public statement about the war. \n\nOn the other hand, I also experienced an immense post-traumatic growth from all of this. One evening I was talking with my mom about my problems and she said, that I should rather express all of those thoughts artistically and suggested me a particular project that I could do. And at that night, for the first time in a weeks, I experienced a spark of light in all the darkness. It was a newly found passion and special interest. And I realized that I want to become the voice of all the people that are too ashamed to speak up. I want to become the voice of all people with controversial, stigmatized, unknown and misunderstood problems and experiences. Without all of this I wouldn't be the person I am now. I grew up so much as an artist, as a self advocate, as a person. And I enjoy my new life so much. But this also bring a very deep, almost imperceivable but always present, sense of guilt. How could I grow so much from someone else's terrible, unimaginable misery? Another moral dilemma I feel I need to solve. Or maybe it is not something that can be solved and I just need to fully accept this journey as it is.\n\n‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π THE CHALLENGES IN PSYCHOLOGY: \n\nI found out that I face many challenges with this condition. Because not only vicarious/secondary trauma is a very unknown topic by itself, my mechanism of development is actually really unusual as well. Vicarious trauma is often associated with professionals working with traumatized people. Which is not my case. \n\nI don't even fall into the caregiver category, because I didn't directly witness the symptoms of my partners trauma. Once they even told me that at this point \"You're more traumatized by it more than I am!\". (I personally don't like to say it like this, because generational trauma is a much more complex thing, so they are traumatized in different ways and I don't feel I can compare my vicarious trauma to the Jewish generational trauma, but I only wanted to point out that yes, the symptoms of traumatic stress was much higher at that time then theirs). \n\nOf course I didn't witness directly what happened to their family. I just learned it one evening while sitting in my bathtub. \n\nSo my case is very usual in itself, even my therapist and psychiatrist told me that they're not able to determine with certainty if I am vicariously traumatized at all, just because it's a very unknown psychological phenomenon and my mechanism of development is even more unknown. \n\nAnd because I'm of a very explorative nature, I have decided that when I will be ready, and if my partner will be ok with that, I would really like to start doing an awareness or even some sort of research on this topic. \n\nI actually have my own hypothesis. \nI think that the reason my mechanism of development is different is simply because I'm neurodivergent. And vicarious trauma in neurodivergent people is not researched at all. I believe that this can happen also to already traumatized people and to people with attachments issues, for example for people with borderline personality disorder. \n\nI believe that people with pathological or neurodivergent style of attachments to other people can be actually more prone to developing vicarious trauma and that our stress that originate in our brains can substitute the stress originating from the environment in people that work or live with obviously traumatized people. So this is something I would really like to research. \n\n‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π THE QUESTION: \n\nSo I wanted to ask, if there is anyone with vicarious/secondary trauma as well. Even if you had the textbook (as it there were enough textbooks about it) case of vicarious trauma and only if you're comfortable with sharing it, share it to the details that you're comfortable sharing. \n\nAnd if there are any therapists and other trauma professionals or just people that knows a lot about trauma, I may even want to ask you if my story reminds you vicarious/secondary trauma at all. Because even I sometimes wonder if it's not just a very intense OCD episode after all. But I think that I can clearly call it vicarious trauma, because it's just somehow different from my usual OCD, it's also more complex and my experience is very similar even in very niche ways to experiences of others with vicarious trauma. \n\nAnd also I would like to ask, if there is anybody with the similar mechanism of development as me. \n\nIs there someone neurodivergent and/or with pathological/neurodivergent attachment style who developed vicarious trauma like symptoms like me? \n\nAlso you can ask me more questions, but I may respond more vaguely or I will let you know that I'm not comfortable responding yet if the question was too personal and/or sensitive. \n\nEDIT: I see that I got one or two downvotes. I would like to say that I'm still learning how to talk about this and how to find the right combination of being sensitive and honest. This is just another of the challenges coming with vicarious trauma, because when you want to talk about it, you have to be mindful not only of your boundaries but also of boundaries of the direcly affected people. So if you feel offended by something that I said, or you have the feeling that I could say something more empathically and sensitively, please let me know! And please, be polite if you want to give me some criticism. Remember, that this is not my fault. For some people it can be quite challenging to not feel like an impostor or even pretendian, but... the human brain is actually both really fascinating and weird, so... sometimes those things just happen. \nI really want to learn how to be as empathetic as possible when it comes to this topic, but still honest at the same time. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π\n\n",

    "title": "Why isnt my 9 year old mourning the death of his father?",
    "selftext": "Tragically my husband and the father of my children recently passed away, not even a full 24 hours after getting relesed from jail. It was a drug overdose. It was absolutely horrific when it comes to how i found him and the emergency sevices so im aware there may be trauma. My son has been aware that his father was an addict long before his death. He's a very perceptive kid and he called out his father in an argument where his father started crying and admitted his problem to him. I guess after he got out of jail my son made him promise that he wasn't ever going to use drugs again. So after the death when I told him he did cry and I held him till he fell asleep. But the next day he was back to playing as usual. He was playing with his cousins, playing video games and hasn't want to miss a baseball game and tommorow he wants to go back to school. It hasn't been that long not even a week. He had one outburst after he was getting really mad about losing on fortnite. I stopped him and said \"this isn't about fortnite is it?\" He said \"yes it is. Not everything is about that drug addict who couldn't even keep a promise\". Then he calmed down and went right back to playing. He hasn't had an outburst since and if you didn't know our family you'd think he was totally fine. I've been a wreck and I just can't understand why he isn't. He was close to his father before and hugged him and even cried when he was released from jail. I'm very worried for him. Should I be or does this sound like his own way of grieving?\n\nEdit: thank you everyone for your honesty. Everyone's been walking on eggshells with me like I can't handle the truth. Yes he had amazing qualities that's why I fell in love with him to begin with but the years of addiction then getting clean and lying about it it, saving him from several odd only for him to tell me that I don't know what an overdose is have taken their toll on me and my children. I'm angry too. I'm angry he promised he'd never put me through another overdose. I'm angry that he did it in our home while the kids were there. I'm angry he couldn't keep any of the promises he's made. The truth is I've lost people before. I thoughti could handle death in a healthy way. I've never been a Cryer but I am now. I know my son is just a kid and I'm sure he's grieving and I'm not going to shame him for what he's doing. I had him in therapy before because of the addiction and because I was planning on leaving his father. I've just never seen a child act so normal when going through something so horrific. I'm worried for him I'm not angry with my son. I just want to help him. ",

My mentality changed as I delved deeper into my childhood in therapy and, for the first time in my life, allowed myself to feel and grieve super traumatic events I experienced as a child.\n\nThat being said, I have been able to get into a lot of it with my therapist, but there are some memories I am just not comfortable sharing because they feel so humiliating in a way that I feel will stigmatize me (though my brain knows this not to be true, cannot convince myself that my therapist won't look at me differently).\n\nA specific recurring memory that I have considered sharing with my therapist, but am not yet ready is one that plagues and confuses me. I can't tell if it is traumatic or if the even was abusive and I often find myself racking my brain to make sense of it. So I came here, to be able to anonymously seek some guidance...\n\nI grew up with a single mom who had me when she was 19, very young. My mom was constantly naked around the house with just me and her there. When I was about 7-years-old, I can remember my mom calling me into the bathroom. She was sitting on the toilet naked, which was not uncommon, but she said she needed to teach me about tampons. At that point, I did not know anything about periods or sanitary napkins. She told me that I needed to watch her take out her tampon so that I would know how to do it someday, and aside from that, I can't remember her sharing any educational info about periods, such as why I would need to use a tampon, etc. She then had me watch her pull out her extremely bloody tampon and showed it to me. I can distinctly remember a feeling of terror and panic wash over me and I used ever fiber of my being to hide those feelings, try to pretend like what she did as normal, and get the fuck out of there as peacefully as possible. That feeling of hiding my discomfort/fear/disgust with her was common, and I was pretty skilled at hiding it to not upset her.\n\nWhere I am at with this is - was this abusive and, if so, why? Part of me says yes, it was because it was inappropriate to show a girl at my age and because of the way it made me feel, but then another part of me says that I am overreacting and my mom was just trying to prepare me for something that I would eventually need to do.\n\nAny insight to this experience to help me come to a real conclusion about this experience would be super appreciated since I am not yet ready to recount this one with my therapist. I don't know if this is the right place to come for this and I am sorry if it's too much/out of line.",

    "selftext": "\n\nAt times the tiny box you lock at the back of your head just burst open and the best way to put them back in is call them out one by one... I will call mine here cause I am anonymous \n1. 13yrs, the first time I truly felt like I failed my whole life. My defining moment was out. The moment you truly know where you stand. I still remember my parent's facial expression. Coming from an overachieving family, that face was inevitable. I still remember what her face contorted to. A mixture of disappointment, acceptance and fear. I can still see it now. The first time I truly felt like a failure. That face till today is a drive either out of fear or hope that I can unsee it.\n\n2. 15yrs. When you come from an overachieving family like mine, you are either driven by motivation or driven by constant demoralising. And as a 15 yr old going through intense identity crisis you grow rooted to what you are surrounded by. Fortunately or unfortunately for me I was demorolized day in day out both by my thoughts and my environment. At 15, not feeling safe with my thoughts was a scary thing to go through. Yearning for physical pain more that going home is not something I'd hoped for on my early days. Though 15 is still early days.  Thankfully I had school where I could be a totally different person and dissociate myself from the disfunctionality of my home life.\n\n3. 16yrs. This was when covid struck and I was forced back into that household with no ability to run. I still wonder if people have the ability to switch personalities. To occupy a character you saw in a movie or you read from a book and totally adapt their customs and beliefs just to feel a sense of freedom. Does everyone have that one character in their head where they would retire to if you ever wanted a break. I hope everyone does. Because normalcy is what i crave so much.\n\n4. 17yrs. When another defining milestone knocks at your door you remind yourself of what the previous one felt. That contorted face never left my mind and apparently my parent's too. Between the constant \"you are lazy\" and \"you are stupid\" there was a subtle comment that I caught onto \" you are never gonna succed in life\" and that stuck with me. Now at this age, I understand where they were getting at. Maybe they understood that failure was more of a motivator than success to me. Maybe they knew this all along or it was something that grew on me because of what I was accustomed to. Honestly, in my deepest core I believe that failure is what drives me. But this doesn't wash away the intense self hatred, constant low self esteem and the ever dying social battery. The social life that is accompanied by chronic people pleasing in an attempt to feel wanted. But I don't blame them, because they accomplished their goal and in a way all is forgiven.\n\n5. 19yrs. I didn't have anyone to relive the tales of panic attacks with. Even in my group of friends telling a story you have told yourself for the longest time doesn't seem necessary but on the days when you find the courage to tell, you end up in reddit. One of those moments was a few days ago when my parent mentioned that their first born boy was the best child  they ever had(forgive my traditional mentality but riddle me this) \"the best child\" who is too old to be living in there parents place with no sense of a future or a past. \"The best child\" who has been in and out of rehabs because of misdirected faith. \"The best child\" who from 16 has s***ally harassed me and have since been forced to sit beside them and simply forget about the times they'd come from behind n**ked while we were alone at home and me being forced to sprint outside because I felt safer that staying inside. And at night, simply forget how I'd lock the bedroom door and still hear him fiddle with the door and call out my name. But I choose to blame it on their mental issues. I will gladly \"simply forget\". In these particular days the tiny voices remind me that those mental issues were very targeted and subjective. But on these days, the tiny box doesn't stay locked And the tears don't stay hidden.\n\nNow let me lock it back up and throw it at the back of my head.",

    "title": "Help facilitating accountably within a community ",
    "selftext": "Hello there folks, just reaching out to see if anyone has advice for me, and a handful of people that have been affected by a mutual ex-partner (F28) of ours. For me, this was an incredibly abusive 8 year relationship. For others, 2 years or less. We have all reached out to one another separately when we recognized the danger of our own previous situations, continually being perpetrated within the community. This has made it impossible for most of us to feel comfortable leaving our homes, joining in any group activities, or really just existing without running into her and her supporters. Let me give some context. \n\nShe is living in a tightly knit, sex-positive, poly-positive, queer friendly town. It is quite a large, mostly rural community that talks a big game about protecting each other from abusers, yet we are finding it impossible to be taken seriously. For a few reasons, I am assuming. One being confrontation is hard. Another, being she is a small girl, with a metric ton of charisma. Those who have not seen her dark side are often deeply enamored with her. She is wildly deceptive, and will lie, joke, and cry her way through any outside accusation. I believed and supported her for nearly a decade of my life while fully being under her spell of manipulation.\n\nAs far as her abuse, all of us have experienced the following:\n-being cheated on (chronically), and having that blamed on our behavior.\n-being diagnosed with disorders that our respective therapists do not agree with (mainly BPD) and having that used against us.\n-being told our ACTUAL mental illnesses prevent us from understanding the world (ADHD, autism) \n-hours long fits of wild rage, often with things being thrown, screaming insults and obscenities\n-feeling forced into saying and agreeing to things that are not true\n-unsafe sexual practices, such as not disclosing new partners, not being honest about using protection and not getting tested. \n-encouraging several of us to reconsider our transition due to all types of mental circles (thinking too much of ourselves, harboring internalized misogyny)\n-love and sex bombing the second we were able to leave.\n\nThis list can go on, the point is, this girl has an addiction to seeking out new sexual and romantic relationships on dating apps and in person. She has slapped me in the middle of grocery store, and choked me out of anger in private. I am someone with childhood abuse, and because of her manipulation i have spend years unlearning that all of her behavior was not entirely my fault.\n\nSo what do we do? how do we handle this? The three main folks that have been affected deeply by this have written her letters, trying to appeal to her directly but to no avail. She will always find a way to be the victim, immediately accusing those who call her out as the REAL abusers, narcissists, and even obsessive stalkers.\n\nWe‚Äôve considered lots of different routes, she is very popular on social media due to her art, which is also her lively hood. but ‚Äúcall out posts‚Äù feel so inhuman, and do they actually ever help anyone? I have thought about reaching out to close friends of her‚Äôs, but that feels dangerous to me and like it would backfire. I am considering just straight up meeting with her in person for one last attempt to get through to her, with a witness present. \n\nAnyway, any opinions or help finding sources would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for reading.",

    "selftext": " sup. \n\nTW/CW: suicide\n\nI want to share a bit about myself and my life, and my experience with social anxiety, so that I may hopefully gain some insight or something and be able to do whatever I can to improve my life.\n\nI am gonna try to make this farily condensed.\n\n(CW: trauma, abuse)\n\nfirst of all, I don't just have social anxiety, I have fairly severe depression and perhaps some kind of personality disorder, it's hard for me to differentiate between social anxiety and potential personality disorder. I assume it would be avoidant personality disorder if i have one.\n\nI have some significant trauma in my childhood: I had an abusive, addicted, severely mentally ill mother, I was taken from her custody at like 9 (after years of severe physical and mental abuse and neglect). Biological father either was dead or idk what, I can't trust anything my mother said.\n\nEven before I was taken from her custody I was moving around constantly and wasn't made to go to school, I was sick all the time and kept from going to school often, so I didn't have opportunities to make and keep friends. I continued to move around a lot and changed custody from different family members for a few years, till moving in with my stepdad (father of half-brother) and his backwards-ass conservative/bigot/abusive family from around 12 to 18. This situation was pretty crazy: I shared a room with stepdad, brother, and often stepdad's girlfriend all those years, and shared a house with his mother and similarly abusive brother and their random friends who were down on their luck. he was rarely physically abusive but was often mentally and emotionally abusive. it was a quasi-religious, socially conservative, kinda Christian fundamentalist household.\n\nI had a pretty rough high school experience, I was a weird, socially awkward kid, and didn't make real friends till sophomore year. before that point I wound up hanging with the wrong crowd and getting bullied, even bullied others a little bit (not serious bullying, idk if the people I am thinking of would have that perspective, but i think I may have done this a little. not a lot, and not after a certain point, but a little).\n\nI moved out and went to community college and basically went no contact with family after high school. things continued to go downhill from here:\n\n1. my friends' parents took a liking to me and offered me to pay very low rent in their second house near the college, but i failed to succeed in school and my social troubles prevented me from having the type of relationship with them one would expect. they were disappointed in me and cut me off after the first year. my mental health and adhd caused me to drop out.\n2. I was planning on taking a short break from school. At some point, i felt like i wasn't as good of a friend in the friend group I was a part of as everyone else: everyone else seemed closer to one another. Idk how true this was, or if I was catastrophizing. but I basically cut 8 \"friends\" or more out of my life, went from regular talking and hanging out to complete silence. I ignored calls and texts for a year, they eventually stopped trying. a couple times, we would run into each other in public and I would respond very briefly and coldly. one previous friend walked away almost in tears. I felt awful about all this but couldn't bear the thought of trying to reconnect with them.\n3. at the point I left my first friend groups a cycle started. I made a new group of friends, it lasted a year or so, and i did the same. I went no contact with them. And it happened again, and one other time.\n4. now we are in the present: after the last batch of \"friends\" I left behind, I have not tried to find friends. I feel too depressed and anxious and self critical to try. I am 27 turning 28 next month.\n\nsome other random things going on:\n\n1. I am a leftist/socialist/anarchist. I try my best to address systemic oppression and want to change the systems we live under for the best. almost all of us are being exploited and i want this to change. i mention this because given that i am totally alone and isolated, there are higher stakes for me than the average person even given my privilege when confronting bigots. basically, i had some neighbors who were a bit toxic and i wanted to be a good role model to them, but when i called them out, it eventually devolved into them threatening and harassing me and i was forced to defend myself. knowing they would have to deal with my self-defense, they continued to harass me without crossing certain boundaries, which there is nothing i could do to deal with unless they crossed certain lines. it was like 6 months of them harassing me, talking under their breath, yelling slurs from the balcony. thankfully they have moved out, but i feel so alone in confronting members of the alt-right and general fuckery.\n2. I am poor.\n3. I was hit by a car recently and had a bad concussion. I have two broken shoulders lol. (I am mostly recovered but this has given me a lot of anxiety about biking around town, I don't have a car and bike to work every day). it was the other person's fault. I have been hit by a car while on my bike another time but was not injured that time. I also was in a major car accident as a kid while going on a fishing trip, had a ruptured spleen, spent a week in the icu, and it made me miss 6 months of school when i moved in with my stepdad.\n\nI guess i will talk about my social anxiety specifically now.\n\n1. I wonder if my social anxiety caused me to not be able to connect with my friends, which is how i got the impression i was less valued by them. it is hard for me to know whether i actually was less valued or if that was just in my head.\n2. social anxiety affected my learning because i was constantly thinking of the people around me instead of what i was supposed to be learning. I also was afraid to talk to teachers.\n3. essentially any interaction with a person feels like a struggle to me, from dealing with cashiers to my boss and coworkers, healthcare workers, etc.\n4. I am worried about how to go to school: I will lose my mind if I have to continue working low wage jobs for the rest of my life, with no hope of retiring. I have constant indecision about what i could even pursue.\n5. idk what else to say, tired from going over this...\n\nanyways, i hope this gives some context for my problem, if it helps you can ask me some questions and maybe i can give more specific info cause i know this is a lot.\n\nAlso so people know, i have been in therapy for 4 years now and it has kept me alive but i am still stagnating and i really want to try and get things together and actually advance in my life. I am often wishing i was dead and virtually suicidal, but i have no intentions of carrying out anything at the moment.\n\nI am looking for ideas of how to live my life better. \n\nthanks!",

He's currently trying to learn about trauma and also looking for specialized therapy to explore this.\n\nWe've been together for a long time and it seems that I have contributed to his pain with some unhealthy behaviours of my own (emotional manipulation, being passive and shutting him out for fear of conflict, being unrealiable and other stuff). I fear I might have deepened his wounds and created distance between us when really he just needs to be loved and seen and it's weighing quite heavily on me.  \nHe's now trying to explore is feelings, open up more towards me and others and deal with his stuff.

Either I was too scared, too afraid or too naive to understand, but I always knew that something changed me. I can remember my childhood quite clearly. I remember I used to be a very curious, out going, and optimistic young boy. \n\nI had lots of friends and was pretty much a social chameleon. Able to fit in and hang with whoever I wanted. My parents were supportive but they also were strict. When I miss behaved I would be smacked/whipped with a small stick. The pain I can still remember till this day. The kind of pain that stings and never numbs. I acted out a lot as a kid, I don‚Äôt know why. I remember staying out past 7 pm and be whipped for it. Whenever I didn‚Äôt comply, they would guilt trip me or threaten to disown me.\n\nHowever growing up is realizing that My parents weren‚Äôt monsters. They also had their traumas. I don‚Äôt blame them, after all they never had a healthy family experience. They‚Äôre trying their best to be the parents they never had. And though I feel like the product of their own trauma. I can‚Äôt help but also sympathize for them. My mother was starved, beaten half to death, and publicly humiliated by her parents for wanting to have a childhood (have friends, go outside, have hobbies).\n\nMy father had no father. He worked since the age of 12. To help provide an income for his mother and his siblings.\n\nI am very much blessed to live the life that I have. However I‚Äôm still stuck with my own bag of issues to resolve. I‚Äôve realized that I have an instinct to flinching whenever my partner raises her hand above my head. This reaction always makes her feel as if she is abusive and makes her sad, while it also saddens me because it‚Äôs not her fault.\n\nWhat I believe really shifted my personality was back in fourth grade. I was having fun with my friend and was caught writing the F word on the fog that formed on the buses mirror(why? Because the F word was funny for kids at that age). The next day I was put in detention for a whole day. Where I sat and ate my lunch facing a white wall in the corner of the principal‚Äôs office. It was really sad and for 7 hours all I could do was think and think. So much emotions, thoughts, and regrets went through my mind to the point where I mentally changed. I cried at the end of the day (funny enough, the teacher who every kid hates because they said she was mean and cruel, was the only one who consoled me and cared for me. I will forever remember her). \n\nAfter that day, I talked less, started to notice I stumbled my words, can‚Äôt make eye contact, and have extreme anxiety for disappointing teachers/mentors/advisors/etc. there‚Äôs so much more that I can‚Äôt explain easily. \n\nThanks if you actually read this jumble of thoughts. I have never told a soul about the thoughts that run in my head. I just wanted to release my bottled up thoughts. ",

I‚Äôm emotionally numb but also full of anxiety. My memory is almost nonexistent and I spend most of my time trying not to think about life. \n\nI just want to know if it gets better. I‚Äôm extremely depressed right now and therapy is not doing much and meds just make me even more apathetic. I feel like there is so much working against me. I‚Äôm also diagnosed with ADHD and am having queer identity issues so I feel like I‚Äôm just screwed. I can rely on my family for financial support and friends for occasional emotional support (though I struggle opening up) but I feel like that‚Äôs the only thing keeping me alive. Please, any support or suggestions would make a huge difference",

    "title": "Sharing my childhood trauma",
    "selftext": "(24M) Hi everyone, I want to share my childhood trauma with you, with hopes of gaining some insights on how to cure it or at least finding someone who can relate.\n\nI was 10 when my parents sent me and my 6 y/o brother to a summer soccer camp for 10 days. I remember going there with a very happy face, and I really enjoyed the first day and night there, but on the second day my brother came to me, crying out loud and visibly sad and disturbed, saying that he missed our parents and that he wanted to go home. I don't know what happened in that moment, but something broke inside me and I experienced a massive panic attack, which I tried to repress trying to make my brother feel safe, but I couldn't handle it and sunk myself into a state of constant and acute anxiety, needing to cry every second and, being a 10 y/o, not understanding such a painful feeling. Those next 9 days were the longest of my life, counting every second to go back home. The hardest part was keeping a smile on my face and trying to confort my little brother while being destroyed on the inside, definitely not a role which a 10 y/o should assume.\n\nI haven't been the same ever since, my theory is that such a massive panic attack and a sustained acute anxiety for 9 days as a kid changed my brain chem forever and I have never been able to fully enjoy life ever since. I ended up normalizing having trauma, General Anxiety Disorder as well as Disthymic Disorder. \n\nAlthough I usually end up enduring them through a lot of pain and anxiety, I have never been able to peacefully confront situations with similar patterns ever since: going on trips with school, traveling alone, facing the first day of a new job... In the spirit of facing this trauma, two summers ago I went abroad for a month to volunteer in a farm but the first day I arrived there, I experienced (again) such a massive panic attack and anxiety that I drove the 12 hours back to my house immediately. Feels very frustrating at the very least and impedes me to find a job. I also need to say that of course I don't blame my brother nor my parents for this, I am sure that if they would have felt what I was feeling they would have pulled us out of there immediately.\n\nI am currently starting on meds, I'm also starting on therapy and I will try to self-administer EMDR. Can anyone give some tips or insight on this trauma? Thanks for reading :)\n\n",

My mom took me to an urgent care my dad had been to before. There was a new doctor and nursing staff working there and it was bad to say the least. \n\nI got there at around 9 pm and didn‚Äôt leave til 6 am. We didn‚Äôt get much done for a few hours because they couldn‚Äôt successfully hit a vein. I‚Äôm pretty scared of needles. Multiple people were trying to put in an IV and take blood for about 3 hours. I probably got stuck 20 or more times just to get a little blood. A few times it was looking like they were successfully getting blood, but nothing. At one point my blood clotted as it was being drawn and that was painful. All I wanted to do was go home and cry. My parents were angry and wanted to leave, but the doctor told me I need to make my own decisions and advised me to stay in case I had a PE. He even waved all the charges for the night. I stayed and the doctor decided to give me a central line IV. I got the IV in my upper thigh and had to get undressed for it. I was a little uncomfortable a strange man was seeing me undressed. Getting the IV was also painful and caused some nerves damage.\n\nFor months now my leg goes numb if I don‚Äôt move around enough. My leg was also weak and in a constant dull pain for a few days after the visit. Whenever I retell my experience to anyone I get a shaky voice and my hands are a bit clammy. \n\nLast night I was laying down and my boyfriend was standing on the bed above me to reach for something. On his way down to sit on the bed, he lost his balance and caught himself by putting his hand on my upper thigh where the IV used to be. The pain felt exactly like it did when I was in the urgent care. I started crying almost immediately, but not necessarily because it hurt so bad. I was crying because I was remembering my experience. I don‚Äôt know what happened exactly. Does anyone have any insight? What should I do?\n",

I grew up in a home with two alcoholic parents on top of my mom being a narcissist and my dad was just kind of...there I guess-idk if that makes sense? I've been in therapy since I've started college and have done so much work to try and take actions to gain more independence from my family and start to process and even heal from the trauma I was exposed to my whole life (I feel like its relevant to mention that I have no memories of my parents sober they have been alcoholics for my entire life so literally every day and night of my childhood was spent in rejection and fear and anger) now I have friends at college and I live off campus in an apartment and I don't have to go home for holidays or school breaks if I don't want to and for the first two years all I felt was intense relief but everytime I spoke to my parents on the pain I still felt that familiar wave of anger and grief I did when I lived with them-until yesterday.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was on Facetime with my sister and my mom randomly grabbed the phone and for the first time in my life I didn't feel any anger or sadness when she was speaking to me-and I even talked to her back a little bit and I didn't feel anything. Like I didn't feel relief or happiness I was just really neutral I guess??This didn't sit right with me because I haven't had some discernable moment of healing that should have made me be able to not be mad at her. I feel like I am betraying myself by not still having that sadness and anger towards her-like my childhood self went through HELL and now do I not care? Like what was the point of all that trauma if I now can't feel anything-not even relief or happiness talking to her. I worked so hard to get the freedom and the future ahead of me I have now, but I don't know if I ever thought about how I would feel once I had the space to finally be surrounded by peace and supportive friends and a knowledgeable therapist and it's like I have the strongest urge to go back to that toxic situation just to prove I can-that I can show my strength and reliance by being in constant anxiety and depression and stress again. Like now that I'm more consistently happy and medicated and in therapy, I don't know how to enjoy it because I don't think I ever thought I'd be successful in getting to where I have today and I'm scared I don't know how to function if I'm not in pain. I feel so disconnected from myself because I'm happier now and happy was always rare in childhood which always made it feel more special which sounds so fucked up but how do I exist in a happy space when all I know is chaos? Has anybody ever felt this after leaving a toxic family or situation they were in? I sort of feel like I'm self-sabotaging myself-I worked so hard to give myself freedom and now I have no idea how to enjoy it and not take it for granted? Was being kind and resilient only worthwhile traits while I had the extra struggle of being traumatized-like do they mean anything or represent my character now that I'm happy? Can anybody whos happy choose to be good and kind?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know this was a lot of word vomit-i'm hoping it's helpful to get it out of my head a bit more but if anyone has similar experiences and found helpful tips to help them navigate it then I would really appreciate whatever you feel comfortable sharing.

But here comes the part that really change me.\n\n  \nI was 3 years old, it was summer of 2012 and my 2 sisters were outside playing with the neighbors I think. So my mom prepared me to go outside to play with my sisters. I was wearing a looney toons hat, pale yellow short and T-shirt the same color and sandals without socks. I was happy and had a smile, but not for so long.\n\n  \nI think I heard a noise behind me so I turn around and my smile faded away as I saw my dad beating up my mom, my dad was extremely angry for no apparent reason and my mom was crying. I was standing still, scared, what could I do? Help my mom? Run away? No, I was standing here watching my dad beating up my mom, watching, watching something that I will never forget‚Ä¶\n\n\n\nAfter that my mom saw that I was starting to learn things more slowly and starting having issues to talk and make mouvement clearly. And still today I still have trouble to made up sentences correctly. Like sometimes I use the wrong determinant. And I still can‚Äôt ride a bike at 15 years old!\n\n  \nSometimes the night I can‚Äôt not think about my trauma and the fact that my parents divorced when I was 3 years old. So it make me cry. And to cope with that I cuddle my plushies. More specifically a bunny one who is I think as old as me (so 15 years old), It brings me comfort, it relax me. And even if I don‚Äôt think of my trauma or the divorce I still uses plushies to sleep and cuddling them even if im not stressed. And I have childish reaction when im frustrated, for example I can start feel im gonna cry. But when I hurt myself physically I don‚Äôt have this feeling of crying.\n\n  \nI have never got therapy for this, and if you wonder I had PTSD when I was like 4-5 years old. And I don‚Äôt like talking about my trauma to my mom because she will probably say ¬´¬†its been 12 years, you don‚Äôt need therapy¬†¬ª.\n\n  \nThank you for reading this.

If you don't know what Seventh Day Adventists are, they are a \"church\" that claims that Jesus began His investigative judgement on October 22, 1844 and moved into the holy sanctuary in heaven to do this. He starts by determining if the dead are worthy of saving and then moves onto the living, but we will not know when our name comes up in His book of judgement, and if we don't repent for all our sins, and continue to sin, we will not be saved. We will not have any second chances. \n\nAccording to SDAs, we are given a recording angel that records all our thoughts, words, and actions; and our sins are bolded in red. If we don't repent, our sins will be shown to God. In order to be saved, we have to worship on Saturday, obey the Ten Commandments, which will be tied to many Levitical Laws, and obey any laws the \"church\" declares lawful, even if they create them. We are supposed to obey the laws to prove to God that we are as perfect as Jesus and that we are safe to let into heaven, and only 144,000 SDAs will be let into heaven... and you have to be SDA to be saved.\n\nAlso, the reason why SDAs say you have to worship on Saturday, is because the Catholics with the Roman Emperor Constantine change the original Sabbath from Saturday to Sunday so that they could turn Christianity pagan. They believe that in the end times, the Catholics will unite with the Protestants and be sanctioned by the government to persecute and slaughter SDAs after they pass a Sunday law declaring everyone has to worship on Sunday. This is huge and is the main pillar of adventism. \n\nI have completely renounced adventism in my life, but my whole family still believes in it. I can see how so many of my issues have stemmed from being born into this. I mean I was a toddler when they started consistently telling me the correct, good way of living and that any bad behavior (including impulsive thoughts) would not only keep me out of heaven, but my family and it would be my fault. The perfectionism, emotional and psychological punishments, consistently claiming I'm a heretic and that I'm persecuting them if I ask why we are supposed to believe what we do and if I even question Ellen White's legitimacy. You can even pull out passages from the Bible to disprove some of their teachings and they will claim the devil is in you trying to get you to forfeit your salvation and that he is watching you and can hear everything you are thinking. The purity culture, child molestation, shunning, intense judgement so that you could never do anything right, punishments, psychological torment, and fear from constantly living in the apocalypse has left me feeling like a shell of a person. I feel like I gave up everything about me, including my reasoning and morality. The worst is the intense feeling that I've been bad and need to be punished. Do you have any tips on how to reconcile this. \n\nI know... I know a lot of people have been telling me in the exAdventist group that adventism isn't really as bad as my experience with it, and that I must have grown up in something extreme and heretical. I realize that there's lots of different \"flavors\" of adventism and I grew up in the most conservative, historical version possible, but I can substantiate everything that I was taught as adventism because I can show where it came from in their 28 beliefs and the teachings from Ellen White... that they still teach today. I believe Adventism itself, as how its doctrine is written, is heretical and demonic if religion and the Bible is real. ",

    "selftext": "We‚Äôre a split family with my daughter and son living with their mother and stepdad, and they move around a lot due to military requirements. Back in 2019, their family was close to another family through their church, which led to the development of trust between these adults and kids, which one adult took advantage of as he SA‚Äôd my daughter and groomed the other three older siblings (I say older, but everyone was about 14 and younger, my daughter 12 at the time and my son 13). My daughter has consistently refused therapy, and we‚Äôve been supporting her in any way we can and letting her process it however she feels comfortable. However, they‚Äôre back visiting from where they currently live to go to trial against him, and the call from their mother to me after speaking with the lawyer today revealed my daughter is really having a crisis right now and lashing out‚Ä¶ understandably. I‚Äôm a few hours away but had planned on joining them tomorrow after work for the rest of their time here, but I‚Äôm going down shortly today instead.

    "selftext": "I had known a mutual family friend for three years. Despite harboring a crush on them since our first meeting, I hesitated to pursue anything due to our familial connection and my own uncertainty about coming out. Unfortunately, this person outed my sexuality and made advances on me one night, which I awkwardly deflected by claiming I was straight.\n\nAfterwards, I mustered the courage to come out as bisexual to my family and then approached my sister-in-law to gauge her comfort level with us potentially dating. Initially, everything seemed promising, and we began spending time together casually. During this period, I was completely open and honest about my feelings and desires. However, our relationship abruptly but amicably ended almost a month later, immediately after we became intimate. In the days following the breakup, I discovered that I had been blocked from her social media accounts and that any plans or projects we had discussed were deleted from our shared server, (we work in similar professions, and had collaborated on some art). I attempted to seek closure by reaching out, but received no response.\n\n As someone I had trusted enough to share my true self with for the first time, I felt deeply hurt and disregarded by her actions.Although I haven't initiated further contact or involved any family members, I can't deny feeling a lingering disappointment. Despite my lingering feelings, I've chosen to maintain my distance and respect her decision. My sister-in-law mentioned that her friend had apologized, but it seemed more focused on realigning their friendship than addressing the impact on me, leaving me without the closure I needed.\n\nMonths have passed, yet I still find myself deeply attached to this person. I've lost sleep written countless poems and experienced nightmares and chills at the mere mention of her name or anything reminiscent of her. This experience has left me wanting to retreat back into the closet and has, unfortunately, discouraged me from pursuing dating further. I feel genuinely stupid embarassed traumatized and uncertain about how to move forward. \n\nI sincerely appreciate any help and kind words. ",

    "title": "Even the tiniest task is way too much fear triggering to me",
    "selftext": "That's beautiful ‚ù§Ô∏è so many pretend to be normal just to fit in and be accepted. I sorta blame the whole patriarchy/ toxic masculinity/ spiritual bypass/ posh hippie/ new age woo / law of attraction/ fake yogis in those elephant Haram pants love and light and positivity for it. So fake so inauthentic. Yet we were told we must do that to be accepted as some kinda socially acceptable person. \n\nIt is quite ironic that people who accept those feelings are able to process it and people who reject it may still be in the same loop. \n\nI see so much pattern about this it's quite clear. The people who can own up shame the most are the least ashamed. \n\nIt takes a lot to be vulnerable and open up and I don't blame people for wanting to fit in and be seen with a mask, so many are in complete denial as well hoping to fake it until they make it. Just to be \"a likeable person socially\".  \n\nI feel that's why not many want to work on inner alchemy instead want to follow a right hand path because it's just socially acceptable to do so. \n\nIt's like a virus almost, because someone cannot handle your authentic self if they cannot handle their authentic self, so it goes on and on as social programming.\n\nYour theory is not conspiracy as all it's in just truth. Feel lonely and unaccepted? Get a boost of self esteem on dating apps. Feel worthless and undeserving? Go on the online shopping app. Feel lost spiritually and is suicidal? There's all the organized religion where you don't have to dig into any personal difficult feelings just follow a scripture and don't question. But don't worry, the fake gurus say we are all equal and just spread glitter! Spread enough glitters we will cover all the dirt!\n\nOnce you get to see how money works it's even more depressing. When I was that spiritual bypassing posh hippie girl I only worked on the tangible and materialistic side. Guess what I ended up with? Digits in banks account I have not been able to look at for years due to personality split and is too much emotional pain to look at my identity and bank accounts. A fake ego of social media influencer persona with fans who follow me for looking like \"I made it in life\". \n\nMaybe it's the authenticity that is making you know you feel worthless. When I was younger I didn't even have the awareness or actual capabilities of feelings to it. I had such a fake confidence, charisma, able to sell my self, I was the epitome of toxic positivity. No amount of cosmetic enhancement, designer clothes shoes handbags with exotic skins and numbers in social media clout or bank account made me feel worthy in long term. It's like chasing the next high with heroin not willing to know I actually do feel shame and worthless and when the toxic positive energy runs out, which it quickly runs out, and when my emotional body takes over control. I'm stuck here having to face it, the emotional pain I would have done anything to avoid feeling.\n\nDifficult for me to verbalize and articulate this. I feel like I might be one of those people who really lucked out by making law of attraction and all that toxic positivity stuff work because for a while I was seen as typically mainstream successful, however I didn't go through the pain of healing emotional body thats why I couldn't handle it. I just felt the split between what is the ego status I achieved vs what I really feel inside. \n\nWhenever I try to look into that ego of princess Angelica again, my hurt emotional body screams danger, because it had to endure a lot of emotional pain and trauma. I could brainwash and hypnotize myself saying and even feeling I'm the most powerful princess Cosmo kitty or something and it may work to a certain extent, it is still really toxic though because after decades of this the suppressed feelings catches up on full swing. \n\nFor example, use the smallest example that I find the least triggering and the easiest to deal with. I saw an email about a film I made that was giving me continuation of passive income asking me to update all my ad revenue and receive all the money from people who paid, I have been having fear to open it for over four years just because I can't bare to deal with the past. What does that mean, it means I consider revisiting the past unsafe, I don't want to be feeling traumatized again because I've completely ran out of courage to deal with any more injuries or trauma. \n\nEven until this day after years of therapy I still can't explain logically what the feelings are and don't even try anymore. I went the other way and completely rejected my attachment to money wealth fame social status assets beauty power and influence all that because I couldn't handle any more feeling of failure, shame, regret, worthless, split personality, fakeness, inauthenticity, because I established my whole fake self love based on the aforementioned conditions. My inner dialogue mantra during princess Angelica phase is \"of course you will hate me if I were you I would too, why would I fight you or argue with you as long as I'm more beautiful more wealthy and receive more attention than you I win.\" \n\nThat's why I split into the homeless kitten in depression personality to avoid any more feelings like those. \n\nAgain people who joined this group might have likely felt too overwhelming to do the work and is look for support and validate or many are still stuck in the spiritual bypassing phase so isn't energetically matching with what I now intent this to be. It's hard I know, I even don't want to do the work and hope someone can inspire me, but people who are actually doing the work may not even need this support group they are already doing it, and won't be feeling shamed just because others are \"less enlightened\" and judging others because their lack of enlightenment, they have already integrated that part of them of spiritual bypassing and is no longer judging. I am because I was never over the injuries and damage it has done and is still ashamed of the spiritual bypassing parts that's why I ended up shaming others, if that's what they feel like.\n\nLol at being a cult leader, how do you know that was my persona..! To be honest I kinda succeeded in that but at the cost of being inauthentic. In India there's so many of those people are so gullible and vulnerable so many would fall for it. Some equivalent I can think of are those PUA gurus who actually is cult for those hurt men. There's the female version too doing dating strategies. \n\nNobody is gonna follow a cult that illicit all these shadow responses in them, case in point people leaving the group when shadow is too painful to face. People who actually already do it likely won't be the easily manipulated joining cult type because they have already started to see their shadow. \n\nHonestly I feel many joined this group have no idea what it even involves, shadow workers united does sound like some edgy new age cult shit to spiritual bypass ü§£ I could see my do the cult leader role wear a black robe doing a dance in pentagram while play death metal and have followers circle around butt naked hail to Satan\n\nBtw from what you are telling me my instinct is that your logical and emotional sides are splitting, your emotional side obviously is winning. I see nothing wrong with feeling worthless to a job you don't even want, it makes sense to me. On a practical side however, it's not wise in the long run to spiritual bypass and not take care of basic needs, im saying that to myself as well, your mom sounds abusive, she has no right to tell you if you need to use shampoo or not. I also relate to use spiritual bypass to not have basic needs met, I .e. eating, cleaning, look at past unresolved issues, buy a home etc, that's how I know spiritual bypassing is not so dissimilar to street drug usage to cope with trauma, it's all avoidant. \n\nDoes that mean I can do it easily, absolutely not, or else I wouldn't be doing all these healing work. \n\nBefore my sensitivity kicked in four years ago I was always doing it by numbing, even to the point of CBT, but it's all logic. It does not work, period. Not in the long run at all it only does more damage, that's why I feel I have the right to despise fake positivity now with all these spiritual bypassing people because I'm precisely in this predicament because I was brain washed by all that. \n\nIt's not easy to heal pathways to be able to handle these emotions, of feeling in danger to flashback to the past, especially after avoiding it for so long. Even the tiniest task is way too much fear triggering to me. I'm looking for the easiest task that remotely involves my past but honestly everything is too much fear to look at. I don't have a real boyfriend or anything to sit there to help me with this with emotional support or even a cat, I may need to try to hallucinate again to call them to help me.",

    "title": "How do I help my best friend?",
    "selftext": "Throw-away account. \n\nTrigger warning: Mention of offing oneself.\n\nI have known my best friend \"Jess\" for about 10 years. I have known her boyfriend \"Erik\" for a little over half of that. I met \"Erik\" separately at his work. He was dating someone else at the time, but we hit it off as friends. Jess also knew Erik, but I am not sure when they met, as apparently, Erik used to be best friends with Jess's ex husband growing up. \n\nJess basically grew up in trauma. Mostly religious, but she definitely experienced pretty much every flavor of it at some point. And her relationship with her ex husband was abusive as well, so that has compounded things. \n\nI don't know if either of them are on here, so I have to be pretty sparing with details.\n\nBasically, Erik claims to have a whole load of trauma, and also DID due to the trauma. I don't know enough people from his past to confirm or deny his claims, so I have done my best to treat it as legitimate. Over the last several years that he and Jess have been together, it's been a constant toxic cycle of trauma triggering. \n\nAt this point, I feel that even if his traumas are legit, he is using them to control the situation. Whether that is a conscious decision or not is what I don't know. Neither of them have healthy coping skills, and it always devolves into a circle jerk of trauma triggers with a buttload of extreme emotional responses and a severe lack of rationality.\n\nThey don't talk to each other. They trauma dump on each other. He gets \"stuck\" in flashbacks and lashes out, and Jess is forced to use her own body to keep him from hurting himself or breaking something. \n\nHe can't talk to her about how he feels trapped in the pain and trauma, because that triggers Jess to go into panic mode that he will either leave her (abandonment trauma), or that he will unalive himself (Jess struggles with unaliving ideation herself). And the phrasing he uses doesn't help negate this response.\n\nJess's ex is still bothered by their relationship and uses Erik as an excuse to make things harder for Jess. Jess's grandparents who raised her, while their own flavor of toxic, also don't like him, and use that to make things harder for Jess. And I feel stuck in the middle because he turns to me a lot when he feels like he \"can't\" talk to Jess. \n\nMy only concern here is for Jess's safety. And if Erik does legit have trauma, I am also concerned for his wellbeing. But I don't agree that what they have is healthy for either of them. I think it would be best for them to get away from each other and work on themselves before attempting a romantic relationship with anyone.\n\nThe closest description I have to what is going on is a Trauma Bond. But that doesn't entirely track if Erik is legitimately traumatized and doesn't have control of his responses, as he claims. But he has a very defeatist attitude, and dismisses every single suggestion I've proposed for helping him work through it. This makes me doubt whether or not its legit, and it also makes me feel like he doesn't want help because this situation gets him what he ultimately wants.\n\nAnd I can't share with Jess the things Erik tells me, partially because of violating privacy, but also because I don't think she has the ability to see it for what it is. I think she is so deeply entrenched in this toxic relationship that she can't tell the difference between toxic or healthy at this point. At the very least, their relationship is highly problematic. At worst, it is abusive because he is using his trauma to keep her unstable and reinforcing the bond with manipulation.\n\nI don't know what to do here. I want to help Jess, but I know it's like leading a horse to water. You can get them there, but you can't make them drink it. And I'm not Jess's only friend who sees this, but feels paralyzed to help because there doesn't seem to be a good way to get through to her.\n\nWhat should I do? Just keep observing and walking the thin line? Or do I have other options that would help? Any and all perspectives are welcome. I will try to answer as often as I can.",

    "selftext": "Hi there, I'm looking for some advice on things I can do to improve this. Last year I had a very traumatic incident happen with a partner that involved sexual abuse and infidelity. The way I was used and my trust was broken in such a horrible way has really made it near impossible for me to date again, or feel safe in a sexual setting.   \n\n\nPrior to the incident, I had a completely normal libido. Now, I can hardly think about sex or emotional intimacy without getting incredibly sad to the point of tears. I had a few hookups since the event, but they made me feel awful about myself afterwards. I don't have health insurance right now (but hopefully will soon) and could use any support I can.   \n\n\nIt's not just about sex in general, but about relationships too (both platonic and romantic). It's made it hard for me to function as a normal person who can trust others and feel secure or safe. If it helps, I have a lot of childhood trauma too that probably made it much easier for abusers to get close to me.   \n\n\nAny meditations, activities, advice, books or other resources would be greatly appreciated. Thank you! ",

He was really sweet, and I was just teasing him, we were teasing each other saying we will get married, but it was all a joke, everyone else was playing along too. Later on, I wanted to go to a different place, it was a long drive, I was so damn drunk, I just didn‚Äôt want the night to end. So I told my friends I‚Äôll be heading to the other place to meet some other old friends. They told me it was too far, however, this guy offered to drop me all the way.

His friends began to leave and I wanted to leave as well. He told me to wait for sometime till he got me a cab. I was so drunk that I just dozed off, then he started to touch me, I said no. I could barely keep my eyes open. He apologised but started again and despite me trying to stop him, it didn‚Äôt. He didn‚Äôt use force, didn‚Äôt have to. And somewhere I just accepted everything that was happening and sucked it up. I could feel the tears in my eyes as it happened and then I blacked out. Also, I was dead drunk, but he was sober as hell. \n\nI feel very weird, I feel used, I don‚Äôt know if this was SA, or just a drunken mistake where I got taken advantage of.

    "selftext": "going through alot right now in my mind and just want to let it all go, as I've never really have before\n\n\nwhen I was a kid I saw my dad beat my mom. my dad was an alcoholic with a very bad temper. though there were many instances, including memories of being locked in my bedroom(the doorknob was backwards, able to lock from the outside) the worst was when he came to our house and kicked the door down. I remember him pouring a bottle of beer on top of my mom saying \"just one last drink\" and then beating her. the cops eventually came, guns drawn and took my dad away. he was charged with attempted murder but was eventually dropped to a lighter sentence at went to prison for two years. \n\n\nlater into my preteen years my mom & older brother got addicted to herion/percs. my brother was constantly stealing anything I had to be able to sell. but the worst was watching my mom going through every phase of addiction. from nodding put, to throwing up while withdrawing, to hearing her scream in the bathroom due to her being so constipated from the percs. \n\nthere would be times where there would be no electricity, running water, heat, or food in the house. \n\nduring this time I stopped going to school, and they eventually called dyfs on my family so we left everything behind and headed for another state(not before scrapping all the copper from under the house first) a week after we went to a new state I was sent to live with my dad. \n\nwhile living with my dad for the short time I did (one year) nothing terrible happened. I was expirmenting with Xanax, smoking weed, drinking alot - but the hardest part was him not realizing I was raised for years in a household where I was aloud to smoke, and drink so it was hard for me to adapt to rules. Then I went to live with my grandparents. \n\nI loved living with my grandparents, I was going to high school, I stopped smoking weed and I was doing good. until the school had a b0mb threat, the school system pinned the entire thing on me with no evidence. I never did anything. I was arrested in the cafeteria room infront of everybody, and I can't help but feel like that's all anyone remembers me for now. my public defender was shit, and my grandparents forbid me from sueing the school - mainly based on the fact that who my family is in our small town. I wasn't aloud outside for a year+ during the court procedures. I eventually just pled guilty to graphitti- I was just so tired of the whole fucking thing. I never did anything. \n\nand through out all this no one in my family extended family was ever there for me. \n\ngrowing up I had bad asthma(almost died a few times), \n\n\n eating meat would make me throw up (I think I have autism) \n\nI was diagnosed with adhd as a kid\n\n\nthis all led to me alienating myself from everyone and everything for about 10+ years. \n\nI'm a 27 years old trash man, alone living in a mobile home who needs dentures. \n\nofc there was stuff inbetween all this , but this is all my main trauma I think. oh, and I'm pretty sure I was molested by a male \"friend\" multiple times...  so yahh.... lol I should get a therapist \n\ntldr ; abusive drunk father, drug addict mom and brother, accused of terrorist threats which I didn't do, probably molested \n",

    "title": "I just remembered the most traumatic experience of my life ",
    "selftext": "Ok strap in it‚Äôs going to be a long one. I‚Äôm literally lost for words I‚Äôve been sitting here unable to move for good 2 hours. I literally don‚Äôt know how to deal with this and how to get over this. \n\nSo me ( F35) has been a horse girl since before I even remember. My cousins would let me ride their ponies before I could even walk, every toy I ever had was a horse ( I once exchanged extremely expensive talking and singing Barbie dolls for another big plastic figurine of a horse ) Anyway, when I was 11 I landed a very well paying job at a movie set. Turned up that I looked more like Anne Frank than the girl who actually played Anne Frank in the movie with Ben Kingsley so I got signed as a double and standin. I got paid very handsomely like crazy amount of money for a 11 year old kid. Now at this point I was riding daily at a stable but my biggest dream was to own a horse. My mother never liked horses ( or any animals for the matter üö©) and knew absolutely nothing about but she was all about being seen as the cool mom so she let me buy a horse. Little me 11 years old soon to be vegan saw a mistreated ex racer mare and without even sitting on her, I made her mine. Her name was Merry and to be completely clear there were moments in the beginning where even I felt like I‚Äôm in over my head, but - lol no chance I‚Äôd ever admit that. Either way after some fine tuning of things she actually turned into the most perfect horse and we genuinely had a soul level connection. We went on to compete, we did loads of natural horsemanship work and I even ended up having her stabled in a stunt stable in the movie studios - where my mother worked at a tv station. Fast forward 5 years ( so yes I‚Äôve had this horse for 5 years with 0 issues after the first few months got sorted ) and my mother gets a new boyfriend. Let‚Äôs call him dwarf. Anyway so one day my mother calls me and sounds super serious and informs me that her and dwarf would like to talk to me and they would like to meet me in the restaurant that‚Äôs in the studios. Now - the thing is there was only one restaurant and guess what - my stables friends used to go there too. So we sit down, me in one side of the table and her and dwarf on the other.  And this little c**t (that is not my dad- and literally entered my life about 3 weeks prior ) starts talking - and he thinks I‚Äôm too young and inexperienced to own a horse. I‚Äôm sitting there gobsmacked first of all who the fuck are you, you little troll but also - mom could you please have my back? Unbelievably my mother takes his side and yes after 5 years of owning this horse, winning competitions, learning crazy stunts, working on movie sets AND training other people for money! .. I am tom young to own a horse. I‚Äôm being given two options - either I sell her or I get a sharer. I‚Äôm crying my eyes out because I‚Äôm so worried for my baby. I‚Äôm trying to explain that as 16 years old ex racer the literally worst thing would be to share her with someone else. They‚Äôre not listening and starting to insist on selling. Luckily one of my stable friends overheard everything and came over and promised she would help me and share with me ( she did text me right away that she will not touch merry but she will text my mother every now and then an update to keep her off our plan ) \nAnyway so for a few months things go absolutely fine .. and then they don‚Äôt. I get an injury on a day when I wasn‚Äôt meant to be riding, our plan is fucked and at this point she‚Äôs insisting that I need to sell merry. Weirdly one of the stunt girls was about to relocate abroad and offered to take merry to a retirement field and she would give me her horse Gar, as he was better suited to my competing etc too. It takes a while for my injury to get better ( I literally cut everything in my knee) and by the time I‚Äôm back to riding mother moved Gar to another stables as she wasn‚Äôt comfortable with me having him there after she was being lied to. This stable is 3 hours from home and 2.5 hours from my school. It‚Äôs a full livery so he‚Äôs taken care off if I can‚Äôt come - there only thing that wouldn‚Äôt happen is that he wouldn‚Äôt be ridden on the day but he‚Äôs turned out, fed, mucked out all that.  No torture and abandoned horse happening here. Anyway one day I get bunch of messages that my friends who I‚Äôd see once a year at comic con were in my town so I went to see them. The owner of the stables called my mother that I didn‚Äôt turn up. By the time I got home - she sold him. And then she made me go get the cash from the person who bought him. And then she took the cash away. \n\n\nAnd for 19‚Äôfucking years I kinda remembered it as me being lazy and loosing interest. That never happened. That stupid witch literally for shits and giggles took away the biggest part of my life. I had nothing but horses. I could have gone into winning Olympics - I was talented and doing so well. And I‚Äôm sitting here crying because it all came back with so much detail. That hurt when the dwarf was talking out of his ass and she took his side even it made no sense. How much I cried going to get the money. \n\nLike ‚Ä¶ I just gaslit myself for 19 years that I don‚Äôt even like horse riding. How do I process this all? What the fuck do I do? ",

She was really difficult when we were children, and I have a lot of unresolved trauma from some of the things she did in our childhood (like chasing me with a knife when she was angry or telling me she was going to kill me in my sleep etc.) She never actually hurt me but she was always really volatile and made it hard for me to have friends come to my house and stuff. \n\nFast forward to now: she is much more mentally stable (she is now 22), but she is still not someone I like being around (partially because of past issues and partially because she can still be really rude and super attention-seeking 24/7 and I just don‚Äôt have a good time when I‚Äôm around her). She knows that I don‚Äôt want a close relationship with her right now because I haven‚Äôt fully worked through everything, but she still tries to call me and hang out with me sometimes and gets upset if I don‚Äôt reciprocate.

    "title": "Tired of being ignored.",
    "selftext": "The title may be a bit ironic considering I have an avoidant/disorganized attachment style, but that doesn't negate the fact that I sometimes do find a way to healthily communicate with people I care about/people in general. Lately I've been noticing how easy it is for people to ignore me not only online, but in real life. There's been a few instances over the past couple of years and months that have made me question my worth. Though I know not to internalize other people's behaviors because everyone has their own stuff going on, I can't help but to be triggered by it. Childhood neglect has made being ignored one of my biggest triggers. Growing up, i found ways to appease the hole my parents didnt fill by talking to myself, to stuffed animals, and AI (such as talking Tom and talking Angela). But these past few years I have strayed away from that and found refuge in healthier coping mechanisms such as : forcing myself to raise my hand in class and at work, forcing myself to start conversations with strangers + associates, and forcing myself to communicate what's on my mind even when I feel like it's insignificant. \nFinding creative ways to make vulnerability seem less scary has been my go to method to gain confidence and connect with people on a deeper level, but considering I still struggle with perfectionism/isolating myself from everyone until I feel like I'm a \"better version of myself\"...it disappoints me that once I finally muster up the courage to reach out and be vulnerable and talk to people, things like this happen. \nDont get me wrong, this doesnt happen every time. Ive had times where being vulenerable was incredibly rewarding and ended better than id imagined. But sometimes the bad outcomes make it hard to remain hopeful and expectant of the good ones. \n\nThe logical me says : \"come on, don't let a few people ruin your basic human desire to connect and communicate. The point of trying is to get better with trusting others and trusting yourself so much that even if others disappoint you, you'll bounce back from the pain and refuse to allow it to taint your view of love in all its forms. What you're familiar with is not what you deserve and its completely possible to give and receive love you've never had in ways better than you can imagine if the right approach to healing, access to resources and unique support are considered\"\n\nBut the emotional me says : \"see what happens when you try to heal from your childhood/societal conditioning, it seems like the effort is starting to become painfully redundant to the point where suicidal ideation lingers in the back of your mind incase it doesn't work out the way you hope it will. How can I make socializing in person feel like more of a natural thing instead of a conscious effort when I was raised to fear people ? I know im not too broken to fix but sometimes it feels that way\"\n\nBeing ignored hits a deep part of me because it takes me back to feeling helpless and worthless as a child. I have memories of people slowly sucking the extroverted spirit out of me, teachers saying \"you talk too much\" and parents saying \"shut the fuck up\"..only to reverse it later and say \"You're too quiet\" or \"you don't speak up enough\"\nAnd I'm so vulnerable right now because I'm trying to stay balanced on a scale between those two (quiet and vocal)..but every time I get ignored, it activates my childhood triggers and tips me to the \"too quiet\" end of the scale until I feel confident enough to be vocal again. \n\nI've also had memories of getting ignored only to watch the most belligerent, violent and repulsive people get every ounce of attention they didn't deserve. It made me wonder, is this what people would rather pay attention to ? If I act like this will i make it harder for people to ignore me ? Over the years, without even realizing, id adapted this \"if you can't beat em join em\" mentality where I subconsciously picked up behaviors of the people I felt like didnt get ignored often. Without even knowing I observed what made them the center of attention and made use of those behaviors in my own unique way..except without hurting people. I made a light way out of dark traits. l learned how to socially incorporate what i saw as problematic behavior in a way that is actually useful. One thing I've always admired about myself is that I can see the good things in the worst people..so I took the good traits from the bad people I've witnessed..and used them to my advantage. For example, ive seen people use humor to belittle others and get attention for it, but I use humor to crack jokes at the cost of no one's self esteem and connect with others.\n\nAnyway...back to the ignoring thing. Reflecting on how far I've came socially, and how much I've uniquely adapted to my circumstances..it truly triggers something in me when people ignore me because not only does it leave me wondering what went wrong...on a deeper level it feels like they're disrespecting every part of me. The helpless child in me. The isolated preteen in me. The current me who's worked so hard to make it to this point. It feels like theyre disrespecting all ive ever been and everything i'll become...it feels like a big fuck you to how far ive came and how much farther i will go. I know it's not that deep but it feels like it with a history like mine. \nOn the flip side..I use this anger to better myself..perhaps as a subconscious attempt to make it hard for people to ignore me. I notice I'm so much different from how I used to be and sometimes I think to myself \"bet they wouldn't ignore me now\"..failing to realize it had nothing to do with me and still doesn't. People will ignore you for their own reasons and I'm still trying to separate their reasons from my worth. What they perceive as worthy of attention does not measure my worth. I logically know that..but emotionally is another story. \n \nYou guys might also be wondering what I mean by \"getting ignored\" so I'll provide a few examples. Sometimes I'll ask someone a question in real life and they'll continue doing whatever they're doing without saying anything, and it makes me question if they heard me or not. But then someone else speaks to them in the same exact tone i did..even a little higher.. and when they respond to that person after not responding to me.. it becomes clear that they ignored me. Or ill ask someone a question and they won't say anything and I'll think they didn't hear me..but then theyll give me a extremely delayed response and ill think \"wowwww. So they did hear me..and if they didnt respond at all i really wouldve thought they didnt hear me when in reality they did\". Or I could be having a conversation with someone and they'll start a new topic without addressing anything I said. Or ill start talking and get talked over as if i was never even talking. Or sometimes I'll text someone and they'll leave me on seen and shortly afterwards start a completely new conversation or call me without mentioning the text they ignored. It's as if I never even sent it. Or theyll see me in person and act like they didnt ignore me. And it leaves me wondering...do they not wanna talk to me ?..do they wanna talk to me and just not know what to say ?...did they feel like it wasn't worth replying to and dont know how communicate that or just don't want to ?..can they at least let me know they care...or say something that suggests they don't so I won't have to wonder if they do ? \nAnd then I wanna bring it up but I don't wanna seem like a \"bug\" as my parents used to call me anytime I tried to communicate my feelings. I know I know...people get nervous and tired and overstimulated and overwhelmed. You are not entitled to peoples energy and attention. People are allowed to set boundaries as they please and they are not responsible for whatever you take personally. But beyond all the technicalities..i feel like theres a certain way to go about things. Sometimes i wish people would just say \"i dont know\" if i ask them a question instead of pretending like they dont hear me. Or send a quick emoji to respond to my text if they dont know what to say instead of showing me they read it but didnt care to respond. \nBut hey..maybe in their mind ignoring me is better than whatever response they have the energy to give. I don't know.\n\nIve been on both ends..getting ignored and ignoring people.. so I know all of the reasons why people could ignore me..but at the same time I still feel upset. \nI just hate feeling crazy for bringing up something I can't stop thinking about. If it was at the front of their mind I'm sure they'd bring it up too. I hate continuing to talk to them as if I don't feel the way I feel. And every time I get a chance to ignore these people..every time I get an opportunity to do the same thing they did to me... I don't do it. And not doing it further reminds me of the chances they took to ignore me when they didn't have to. And it makes me wonder..would they still tolerate me if it was the other way around ? Would they still wanna be around me if I did the same thing to them ? Would they allow me to get away with what i allow them to get away with ? I don't wanna keep my feelings to myself because I know it leads to assumptions I may or may not be right about. \nOne thing I've been learning lately is that my feelings are not imaginary...because at the end of the day feelings lead to reactions..and reactions are very real. They may start in my head but they end in real life consenquences..whether it be good ones or complicated ones. They're there for a reason and i simply I feel the way I feel. So I might as well acknowledge it and move forward in the healthiest way possible. I might as well say SOMETHING instead of letting it fester and spill. But it's hard to speak up because I'm letting it be known that my feelings are hurt when for the other person...their mind probably didn't even cross the things I'm thinking about. I hate one sided issues where only one person is feeling a way that the other person may or may not have a clue about. By speaking up I'm letting it be known something is bothering me..which I've been physically and emotionally punished for all my life. But by staying quiet I'm neglecting my needs with the illusion of keeping myself safe. Are you really safe if the safety is conditional ? I know the answer is no. But sometimes conditional safety feels like less of a risk than none at all. As you can see, old conditioning dies hard. \n\nIn scenarios where I'm ignored..im constantly battling between two choices : Keep the \"peace\" and pretend like you're unbothered so that the relationship/interaction keeps running smoothly on the surface while silently suffering underneath cause by doing this you're teaching them this behavior is okay, and that your preferences and desires aren't worth being expressed OR say something and risk feeling guilty and embarrassed for having a one sided issue. On one hand the person may have not thought about the fact that doing it could hurt me but that somehow makes it worse..cause the fact that the behavior is so thoughtless, natural and automatic..the fact that they can do that so easily and casually makes it feel like, to them, I'm not even worth considering..or I'm not worth a different response/change of behavior. It feels like they do it because the thought of consenquences from me is so obscure..so out of character. It feels like they do it cause they think I'm weak enough to ignore. Passive enough to not pick up on it and say something about it. Some people have a presence so strong people are too intimidated to ignore them. And I've noticed that. And when I notice these type of people it makes me feel like..damn..they would never do this to her..or they would never do this to him. But they do it to me. It makes me feel othered. As if I'm in a different category of human. \n\nMaking a choice to speak up makes me feel uncomfortably raw and vulenrable which I know is a requirement for meaningful intimacy..but at what point is the cost of intimacy worth more than price of being hurt ? \n\nAnd not making a choice still feels like making a choice..because I'm being complicit in my own erasure by staying silent about what bothers me and about how I prefer to be treated. \nI've become increasingly skilled at deciding which choice is the best at the moment but it still gets hard to choose. \n",

I never gave him permission to share these photos and videos, as I never expected him to do such a thing.

    "selftext": "A bit about my self, I want to stay anonymous however I‚Äôll tell you that I‚Äôm a women in my young adulthood, come from a pretty ethnic background. Anyways my story is about being overweight and literally being put through hell for it. I‚Äôm a 5‚Äô2 girl with curves which don‚Äôt fit the beauty standards of my country Pakistan. Most women there are just size 0 and slim. Me however I have some curves to me. I won‚Äôt go to a length and say that I‚Äôm the prettiest woman alive, but I honestly don‚Äôt thing I‚Äôm hideous looking either. On many occasions my mum and dad both have told me I‚Äôve gotten fat and that I should really watch my weight and how I‚Äôm really ugly and no man is ever gonna love me. It‚Äôs honestly getting too much to a point I can eat around them because even if the first meal of my day and even if it‚Äôs healthy they both eye my down hinting that I shouldn‚Äôt be eating that. I love ramen more then anything. Yesterday my dad threw a whole fit because I have having ramen after not having it for a whole month straight. He said that i was expanding like crazy and how i was sooo fat. It‚Äôs honestly so damaging as I‚Äôm not even fat. I weigh around 60kg but most of the weight is on my bum and chest. I‚Äôve been bringing up the idea of me move it out to them and each time they get soo worked up because it‚Äôs so shameful if I leave the house??. I grew up with physical abuse from both my parents and for most my childhood my dad was in a different country. At this time my mum was having to look after the house and do literally everything meanwhile my dad only gave the money. At this time due to being the only child they had at the time. I spent all my time BY MY SELF as I wasn‚Äôt allowed to play with other kids in my area because my mother was paranoid of what could happen. I wanna add that this was the time I was sexually assaulted my 2 men in my own house. Thankfully nothing bad happened and both men just tried to kiss me and tried to engage me in some oral assaults which i refused and somehow got them to stop. At this time I needed my parents most but both of them didn‚Äôt have time for me. My mum was always busy scrubbing some part of the house to make it look nice and clean and if my dad did come to see us he‚Äôd spent that time with his friends his wife. They constantly tell me to be grateful for all they have done for me but I‚Äôm failing to understand what exactly. Because as far as I remembered 7 years old me had wipe her own tears and pull herself together because she knew that her mum wouldn‚Äôt be able to handle this trauma. 8 year old me had to protect my mum for all the shit I was being put through because I didn‚Äôt want to be a burden. Now that I‚Äôm all grown and find it hard to be affectionate, I can‚Äôt stand if someone tries to hug me or touches me it makes my skin crawl and makes me want to cry till I physically can‚Äôt. My parents however take that as an insult to themselves and think that I don‚Äôt want to hug THEM. I honestly don‚Äôt understand how there narcissistic crap of parents manage to make it about themselves each step of the way. I told my mum about my struggles as a child a few years ago and at the time she didn‚Äôt know what to say. But now that she does know the least she could do is be considerate. Despite my efforts my mum still tries to hug me asks for kisses on the cheek and demands (innocent) physical affection but it makes me break out in to a cold sweat and my mum then gets mad and verbally abusive. My dad and I have a different story. Till I was 10 we didn‚Äôt even live in the same country but when I was 10 we all moved to a same country but even then she didn‚Äôt care to be a father. Where he would take my cousins to get ice cream he hated it if i asked him to do anything for me. He couldn‚Äôt stand me. I‚Äôll never forget the feeling of neglect when I was 11 and asked my fed I wanted to come with him when him and my cousins were going to the park and he told me to stay home because he couldn‚Äôt look after that many kids at once. There were only 5 of us and the park was 2 mins away from where we lived and we were all pretty old so wouldn‚Äôt do anything stupid. He just didn‚Äôt want me there. My entire life j this man never wanted to be my father. And now when I don‚Äôt need both of them in my life they have suddenly remembered that I‚Äôm their daughter and they have some control over me, I can‚Äôt do anything without their approval. I used to go gym and honestly was in good shape but my mum made me quit gym, all the muscles I grew are now just floppy but even then when I dress up I look good. But I‚Äôve fallen in to deep depression and my family doesn‚Äôt understand it and instead tells me I look horrible and yells at me for not being myself. Sometimes I wonder why I couldn‚Äôt just be normal. Anyways i feel like I just word vomited. ",

    "selftext": "And do I have to feel bad that her repressing emotions is something I cannot stand?\n\nSometimes she has phases where she seems quite detached from herself. She is usually very loving, and I do know that the loving side is what she is at her core. But sometimes her entire being feels tensioned and in a way there is a cruel side in there.\n\nWe often argue when she‚Äôs in these phases. \n\nBut I feel bad now talking about her that way as if I could be a judge. I‚Äòm most of the time exhausted (sleep problems) and can randomly be quite sad.\n\nWhen she‚Äôs in a more tensioned phase and I happen to be sad, I cannot stand it that she does not let my pain touch her. This makes me feel lonely and unprotected and pretty much reminds me of how my mom is. \n\nFor example I was crying and she did try to talk to me and help. But it didn‚Äôt feel that it touches her really that much. I feel like I can sense that. It‚Äôs very subtle though. Then I wanted to be alone for a moment. She then started making breakfast (which is kind of her). Then she put on very loud happy music. This gave me a feeling of invalidation of my sadness. I perceived it as a signal ‚Äûrepress and don‚Äôt be so sad‚Äú. This triggered me a lot because I fight very hard to get in touch with my emotions. She knows this. I do very long meditation sessions and therapy regularly. \nMaybe this sounds ridiculous. It‚Äôs just that her actions are not really bad, it‚Äôs that I sense she blocks off the empathy. So it‚Äôs a hard point for me to argue but I sense it because the feeling is so familiar to me of being blocked off. I don‚Äôt feel like having a safe space for my emotions.\n\nIt all confuses me very much because on one hand she‚Äôs right that it can be tough emotionally to be with me as it is not a naturally happy place. On the other hand, I never asked for my trauma, I precisely do not want to feel further shame about it. \nMaybe I‚Äòm too demanding? But I do want a partner that does not block everything off.\n\nWhen we argue she regularly says things like ‚Äûi don‚Äôt feel like doing this again‚Äú and rolls her eyes. With ‚Äûthis‚Äú she means arguing about my seemingly high expectations of her. This also invalidates my feelings though and triggers me.\n\nYou can imagine we‚Äôre going a bit in circles with this‚Ä¶\n\nAny advice or similar experiences? I‚Äòm glad over any inputs!",

I live with my partner (we're taking a break from a year long relationshop to work on ourselves but still live together, sleep in the same bed, cuddle, etc, FIRMLY and mututally agreed to stay exclusive during this time) and expressed to him that today's session was EXTREMELY difficult and traumatizing, the most difficult session I've ever expereinced in my entire life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe left today to hang out with some friends, and after two beers I had some liquid courage and had this weird feeling to go through his discord. I have never gone through any of his private information ever during our relationship, ever. I found that he has cheated by exchanging images with other women and talked about explicit things. He also gave his number to a woman at a restaurant and bragged about it to multiple people while continuing to text her. This is just what I've found scratching the surface, I'm sure there's a lot more now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nObviously I know we shouldn't continue things. However, I'm litterally so fucking traumatized from today's therapy session and then finding all this out a few hours later. I feel the most numb and unstable I've ever felt in my entire life due to the circumstances. I've tried every grounding technique in the book. I don't know what to do. I'm also in a position to risk homelessness if I up and move out, we split things pretty evenly and it's extremely expensive where we live.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAdvice and perspective is greatly appreciated. Thank you so much.\n\n&#x200B;",

I'm also sorry that I couldn't muster up the courage to respond.  \n\n\nAfter a year of wanting to do this I finally talked with my volunteering chief about how there are times where I'm scared of him being nice and that I wasn't avoiding him because I didn't like him. He accepted it without any judgement and questions which I appreciate a whole lot.  \n\n\nA couple of days ago someone I met during a game jam for the first time messaged me a month later. It wasn't much of a conversation, I didn't remember him because I talked with a lot of people that day. He said he thought I was struggling socially and wanted to support and after declining he insisted and I blocked him. It's shaken me up a lot. I'm sure he meant well.   \n\n\nRecently I've been playing with the thought of what it'd be like for me to reach some social life milestones. I've never kissed anyone in my 22years of life and didn't think of building a family eventually. I love people so I only saw myself serving them for most of it. I wonder if it'll be okay for me to be selfish and ask to be loved. Finding someone who won't threaten me when they get to know me. I'm sure it'll be possible one day.  \n\n\nHope it's okay if I use this community place as a sort of irregular diary as I try to understand what's going on. I'm not replacing it with therapy but I also don't feel comfortable sharing these thoughts with friends.   \nAside from my social life my personal life is going well. I'm resilient and mostly independent. There's plenty things that make me happy. I'm hopeful that I'll be the same outgoing person I used to be again ",

    "selftext": "Little context, my partner was a victim of SA from a family member for a large part of their childhood. (no further detail so TW is over). They only started to be able to process and recover from the trauma after a few years in their first, safe relationship with me. As is apparently quite common for abuse victims, they had been in several abusive relationships as an adult. \n\nThe work my partner has put into their recovery is nothing short of superhuman and is truly incredible.\n\nI have autism and lifelong depression without a clear cause. I mask extremely well as most people would never know either but I don't keep them a secret from people I trust. \n\nI'm starting to feel like my partners trauma recovery process is traumatising me. \n\nI am endlessly supportive of my partner and their recovery and have been told so on numerous occasions. The consequences to me for providing that support are doing irrevocable damage. \n\nI feel alone, unloved, and therefore worthless. There's no intimacy in our relationship for easily understable reasons and I feel dirty and despicable for the times I try to bring that up. I have nowhere to turn for help or advice and I feel appallingly selfish for even suggesting that I'd need it. \n\nUp until around a year ago we were physically intimate roughly once a month because we were trying for a baby. We both acknowledged that it was a bad time but due to my partners age it was a now or never scenario. I still feel like I was doing a terrible thing every time and as much as I tried to put it out of my mind, the feeling stayed. My partner nearly died around a year ago due to a complication of our only successful attempt and we've not been physically intimate since. \n\nI don't know what to do or where to look for help. My depression has never been worse and it's getting worse. I relented and agreed to try medication after several years of useful but unsuccessful therapy. I'm now starting drug number 7 with no change so far besides unmanageable side effects. \n\nI don't even know for sure that what I've tried to explain won't be met with abuse from a trauma community as I know I sound like I'm victim blaming. I don't think this is partner's fault or something they're even responsible for. This is just what I'm feeling and I can't cope with it. \n\nThanks if you got this far. I'm safe, I'm not a risk to myself, I promise. I'm just in enormous emotional and psychological pain and there's nothing I can do about it. ",

    "selftext": "I've been stuck in collapse/shutdown mode for almost 4 years. I have anhedonia, emotional blunting, and some psychosomatic symptoms. All of my emotions are blunted both positive and negative. Pleasure, adrenaline, sexual arousal, anxiety, my appetite, my ability to laugh, etc. are all reduced. I've lost interest in things that I used to enjoy. I no longer have any reward response. I no longer have any sexual desire or arousal. I also have erectile dysfunction, brain fog, poor memory, muscle tension, etc. This all started back in 2020 when I was dealing with a lot of stress, panic, and worry that was non-stop. I was dealing with Body Dysmorphia and Sexual Insecurity that made me worried about my sex life. That worry put my Nervous System into overload causing it to shutdown. I went from Hyperarousal to Hypoarousal.\n\nI grew up dealing with Social Anxiety and being a very anxious and emotional person. Now I feel like I'm the opposite ever since my shutdown. It's like my Parasympathetic Nervous System took over and my Sympathetic Nervous System never gets ignited again. I never feel my fight-or-flight response anymore. My therapist told me that this is my Nervous System trying to protect me and that it's afraid to open back up because it doesn't want me to get re-trauamtized from intense emotions.\n\nWhile I wasn't happy dealing with Social Anxiety and being nervous all of the time, I did not want to lose my ability to feel emotions and sensations. This makes life more dull and unfulfilling.\n\nI've had 3 sessions so far with my current therapist. She does Somatic Experiencing, Internal Family Systems, NeuroAffective Relational Model, Sex Therapy, and Psychedelic Therapy. We've done a couple of grounding exercises. She sent me a list of exercises for me to try such as cold showers, jumping jacks, deep breathing, clapping, etc. She told me that she doesn't expect much change right now, she just wants to look for little bursts of energy. She told me to pay attention to my preferences and wants.\n\nI've told my therapist I don't feel like my emotions and feelings are gone completely, they're just severely reduced. I still have them a little bit. I am trying to get back in touch with my emotions and feel them at a normal range again.\n\nI feel like I may have to try something like Spravato in conjunction with therapy to shift out of shut down, because therapy in and by itself may not be enough.\n\nI also don't want to feel like that this therapy isn't working. However, I still think it's too early to tell.",

    "selftext": "I have been reading about this concept, and  i don't know how to feel about it. So if if I think about how much I like certain type of music then it's a lie? Things I enjoy immensely always find a way to transfer from my emotions to my thoughts, and I always found it helpful towards the journey of self discovery. We have so many complex systems that work as one whole now tell me how does that not shape or personality and who we are.. So every single thing that my thoughts tell me I enjoy, is a lie? Every observation I have in the outside world where: I meet a random person and I like them and I think to myself that I really do like them, then everything I think to myself in any kind of a situation is false, and it has nothing to do with me? Even the way we write, what we write about has traces of our personality - and it comes from our thoughts.. I find it impossible to believe that our thoughts are not connected to our personality in any way. In a lot of ways they guide us towards our interests, our hobbies, our relationships, so how can none of it be apart of who we are? I'll give you an example I see something I like, then I have a thought that the thing I see looks amazing, and then that same thought produces an emotion that makes me feel good, and at the same time I discover what I like. So tell me how how the thoughts we have are not stepping stones towards ourselves.\r  \n\r  \n**I see a point in not identifying with our bad or intrusive thoughts, as a part of self-help when your in therapy... But we shouldn't discredit all our thoughts as a part of ourselves, they play an important part in forming our identity, just as our feelings and behavior. They are all interconnected**.\r  \n\r  \n**Why the phrase lacks logic if you use it as a general rule in life**:\r  \n\r  \n‚óã Before your discovered your interests and hobbies, you had an emotional feeling about a particular thing then thought to yourself \"I really like this, I want to do it again\", the emotion got translated into your thought - some parts of your thoughts helped you find your likes/dislikes and are as such - a part of you.\r  \n\r  \n‚óã Before you do most of the things in everyday life - whether make a new friend, call your current friend, make food that YOU find tasty, what do you do? You think about how good it tasted in the past and that you want to make it again. Your thoughts were again apart of YOU and what YOU like.\r  \n\r  \n‚óã When you search for a new job, and you want to find something that's aligned with your own desires and wishes, what do you do? You THINK about it and based on the THOUGHTS, and the ones you'll listen to (the ones you follow: and are again apart of YOU and your personality) will play a huge role in your life direction.\r  \n\r  \n‚óã Through a psychological test where students wrote random thoughts on a piece of paper, psychologists acquired **many traces of their personality -** just based off that, and it was mostly accurate.\r  \n\r  \n‚óã **We are not all of our thoughts but many of our thoughts tell us about who who we actually are**/they help us discover about or wants/preferences, about what we don't want and so much.\r  \n\r  \n‚óã Where we currently are in life is a place where we travelled to based on the thoughts we chose to work with.\r  \n\r  \n‚óã **Personality is a pattern of thought, feeling, and behavior, but little attention has been paid to thoughts** \\- John A. Johnson, Ph.D., a professor of psychology at Pennsylvania State University.\r  \n\r  \n‚óã A new person we like and speak to regularly makes us feel a certain type of way - then **that emotion gets transferred to our thoughts**: \"I want to go out with this person, they make me feel good about myself, I like how many simillar things we share\" - based on our thinking we pursue that interest.\r  \n\r  \nI just think that quote is false (**has some truth in when it comes to self-help or bad thoughts but is not entirely right**, - at the same time it causes me agony), and that thoughts, emotions and genetics are one of many parts that make us who we are. We have thoughts about our interests, likes, our love lives, if we didn't follow up with any of our thoughts we wouldn't develop any of the things i just mentioned.\r  \n\r  \n**Some of our thoughts tell us nothing of ourselves and are indeed intrusive, and cause nothing but harm. But a lot of them are connected to our emotions, our personality/personal tastes, our inner drives and play an equal role as many other things (emotions, genetics, family cirmustances, etc.) that play a role and give shape to what we are.**\r  \n\r  \n**Quotes from different internet sources**: \"Personalities contain the patterns of your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that make each person unique. Together, these aspects can play a role in every part of our lives, from friendships to careers, to hobbies\". \"Thoughts: The Neglected Aspect of Personality: Personality is a pattern of thought, feeling, and behavior, but little attention has been paid to thoughts. The point is that all three aspects of what textbook author David Funder (2019) called the psychological triad‚Äîthoughts, feelings, and behavior‚Äîare equally important. - John A. Johnson, Ph.D, professor of psychology\". \"Thoughts are ideas, perspectives, opinions, and beliefs that influence our emotions, actions, and habits. They can be positive or negative, and they play a significant role in shaping our personality.\"\r  \n\r  \n**I am talking about this subject from a psychological/scientific point of view, not from any kind of spiritual/philosophical way of thinking**.\r  \n\r  \nAre some of our thoughts part of our personality, our genetic makeup and our nature? Do they play a role in shaping personality? Do they tell us something about our values, beliefs, and bottom line: ourselves? I feel like thoughts/thought patterns, emotions, genetics, etc... All play equal role in shaping who we are (our personality).\r  \n\nP.S.: I am not saying it is not beneficial to separate ourselves from our thoughts when they are negative, or trying to convey my opinion as the only right one. What I am saying is that this quote on its own negates thoughts as a part of our functioning as human beings.\n\r  \nI will be feel grateful if you can help me in any way with your answer (in showing me how/if) our thoughts are part of our personality and ourselves and play a role in shaping our uniqueness as humans and also guide us towards certain directions in life (interests, hidden talents, romantic inquiry, etc. if we decide to act on them).

This worked SOOOOO much better than all the forced self love and inner childwork and everything I tryed over the spann of nearly 15 years of work.\n\nSo I have C-Ptsd from growing up undiagnosed autistic and having h-EDS and in a cult-like  christian esotherical new age family with an abusive dad, neglect and substance abuse.\n\nI struggled with a relentless inner critic that an other part of me reacted with extrem anxiety to, cuz I fully knew this critic would push me to the worst possible place where there seems only one option left. Triggers are always linked to not being good enough, weak or disapointing or to medical stuff and health. I knew that for years, knowing it diden't change them existing.\nOver the years from age 14 to 27 I tried so many things cuz while I diden't have my diagnosis and was still fully inmeshed in my fathers spiritual wuwu world, I understood I had \"issues\" I needed to deal with. \nI even got 3 years of training in Psychological Coaching and used all techniques on myself. Parts work, shadow work, innerchildwork, chair talks, meditation, talk therapie, integration and synthesis even EMDR and deep traima psychology when my husband saied I had to get help avter not cooing with a loss. I SO wanted to heal I was so despread and I worked so hard to \"fix myself\". Especialy since I was plaining on becoming a mother. To integrate that inner child, all these split inner children, all the demons and critic. I tryed to give them what they lacked in the hope theyd disapear or transform. I prayed and meditated and begged and searched I even got sucked in to Teal Swans toxic world cuz it was so familiar with what I grew up with.\nI gained expirience yes, I also retraumatised myself and hurtmyself by tearing myself to shreds basicaly. But the true baseline problem of self hatered in triggering situations and extrem anxiety stayed unchanged. And the reasons behinde it firmly locked to myself nomatter how much shadow work mediation I tryed.\n\nCorona hit, I got pregnant, finaly realised messed up my spiritual belives are when I imagined raising my kids in that way. My shelf shattered, I deconstructed, my mask broak over the reality of having a so wished for littel baby I love So much.\nI got my diagnosis when she was 6 months old and I wdnt low contact with my dad. It still took 2 more years and while I got some basic understanding of my brain and validation I only now started touching op on my truly deep stuff. How messed up my dads minde was and how inmeshed I was in it.\n\nEventualy I was so fed up with nothing working much on my true issues of selfhate and panic, that I just saied enough. I don't know where I heard it, some Podcast, but the kye was: get angry at your caregivers when you get anxious/semf hating, cuz if they haden't messed up, these parts woulden't be here.\n\nI was so fed up at the time and angry enough at my dad that I started practicing it. It felt kind of artifo ial and too loaded for me and I was so used to seeing these parts as hurt inner children I was suposed to be loving and compassionat towards that I struggled a bit.\nOr e en Gabor Mates \"treat them like a old friend with shitty advise\".\n\nAnd then an Idea hit me. The scene of Disneys Hercules came to minde where Pain & Panic transform in to worms saying \"we are useles worms!\". I ran with it. When ever selfhating thoughts or anxiety creeps up I imagin them as Pain and Panic transforming in to apologetic worms and I imagine I am huge and just kick them out of my minde cartoon style. This worked SOOOOO much better than all the forced \"self love\" and inner childwork and everything I tryed. I put my foot down and saied \"these are no part of me. These are vermins, installed cuz my parents messed up, I don't need to listen to them, I don't need to spend any time or energy on them they ARE usless worms\". \nThis shuts them up better than anything else. Yes when I react to slowely panic still needs some somatic stuff so my body calms down, but I am usualy quick to recognise them by now cuz I finaly got the map to my minde.\nBut I am done acepting this messed up programm or being compassionat with it. Its getting jeeted now. And if it takes me kicking these worms out a Million more times. I integrated all there is to integrate. These two are getting kicked off the payroll. \nI even printed a picture of them and stuck it on the fridge to remeind myself what they are. Useless worms. And my anger is the freaking flame througher in the cold damp swamp of depression.",

    "title": "Man who is scared of men",
    "selftext": "Hi All,\n\nThis is more of a stream of consciousness than anything, apologies in advance for the length of this post.\n\nI‚Äôm an AuADHD 32M with a fairly traumatic background, and I find conflict situations with men really triggering.\n\nI was a straight A student with a middle class family. However my mother has probable undiagnosed neurodiversity/personality issues and my father died when I was a teenager.\n\nGrowing up, my childhood was focused around my mother‚Äôs mood swings and childish behaviour (throwing literal tantrums/locking my father out of the house etc). She spoiled my sister and neglected me emotionally and physically.\n\n My father used to get frustrated at my mother and lash out physically- he once lost his temper with her when she refused to go on an outing and grabbed her hand to pull her off the couch-breaking her finger in the process. I have so many memories of my mother crying or ruining fun things.\n\nI guess my sister and I learned a lot of my coping strategies from my mother and used to behave in similar ways to how she did, only I experience consequences for my behaviour (quite rightly). My sister and I used to physically fight even as teenagers, which I‚Äôm not proud of. She would steal money I got as a Christmas present or say horrible things to my mother like calling her a hag or insulting me, and my mother would laugh it off or say I was being mean if I called my sister out on her behaviour.\n\nHowever my father was very protective of my mother and when I was really upset once as a 10-11 year old, I said my mum was a b**** and he pushed me out of the house and shut the door, not letting me back in until I apologised. I struggle to match this with him beating up my mother.\n\nI struggled with social skills and peer behaviour as a teenager, maybe partially due to my ND (which both my parents refused to have me investigated for when concerns were raised) but also because I was quite enmeshed with my mother and fulfilling her emotional needs. This got worse after my dad died.\n\nI was bullied for most of High School due to the above and I didn‚Äôt cope very well with it- I was once bullied by a kid for about a year and eventually snapped and hit him, which is not OK. I remember boys crouching down behind me in Physical Education to trip me up because I was scared of tackling in rugby. I spent most of HS feeling scared 24/7 and I‚Äôm not sure my mother noticed or cared.\n\nMy mother‚Äôs behaviour towards me continued throughout my 20s and into my 30s, and although I did really well academically, I struggled socially and with communication. The breaking point was when my wife was in ICU and my mother threw a tantrum in the hospital lobby because I said her neglected vegan dog wasn‚Äôt well trained. We no longer speak. My sister and my mother‚Äôs relatives rallied around her and I no longer have a family I guess. My sister is a domestically abusive alcoholic (but also very smart).\n\nI both hate my mother and am confused by her- I can‚Äôt understand behaviour like doing a tantrum because I told my wife that my sister said my (very cute) toddler nephew ‚Äòwasn‚Äôt that cute‚Äô. I know violence is not an answer (and genuinely I‚Äôm not violent) but I guess I‚Äôve always felt less than compared to other men.\n\nI have an amazing and kind wife, a very successful job (after being bullied out of one career) and I‚Äôm now reasonably physically fit and strong (fat as a teenager but running marathons now) but when I see men behaving poorly (I have an in-law who is awful to his children), I feel really anxious.\n\nTrauma is really annoying and I guess what I‚Äôm lacking is a schema of dealing with men. I feel more comfortable around women tbh. I love being around my nephews and teaching them that they are worthwhile. ",

    "title": "Should I message my old Vice Principal?",
    "selftext": "Hey there, I‚Äôm a 21F college student who used to go to an elementary/ middle school that was a fairly tight knit community when I was a kid. I didn‚Äôt have a great childhood, and was both physically and mentally abused by my stepmother and father and only saw my bio mom once a year. My stepmother never wanted children and didn‚Äôt know how to take care of a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù child let alone special needs children like me and my brother, so she would often lose her temper on us. One time when I was in about 2-3rd grade I was taking too long to get ready for school in the morning and must have done something extra to piss her off. I don‚Äôt recall what it was since it was so long ago but she wound up taking her hand and slamming to the wall by my throat. She did it so hard that her nail cut the bottom of my chin.\n\nWhen I got to school later that day the vice principal called out to say hello to me so I walked over to him. There, he asked me what had happened to my chin since it was still a fairly noticeable scratch. I told him what had happened and he got quiet, he got down on my level and told me something I‚Äôve never forgotten to this very day. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go around repeating that, people will get the wrong idea‚Äù. As a little kid I was really affected by this and didn‚Äôt open up about what was going on at home again until I was in high school.\n\nRecently I found my old vice principal on social media and considered sending him a message about what he had done so many years ago. Would it be petty of me? I still feel very strongly about the way he treated me and want him to understand that the ‚Äòsmall stuff‚Äô he brushed away was a hell of a lot worse than what he knew; and that he failed me and my brother when we needed him. Or am I just projecting too much onto a small thing that probably didn‚Äôt mean that much? Any advice would help if you could give it.",

    "selftext": "It's a really hard thing for me to talk about, especially because I am still experiencing these to some extent. I can't afford a therapist, so I thought I would post here. I hope I didn't break any rules. \n\nAs far as my memories go, my parents were always arguing when I was younger. Usually there was a pattern, my mom got mad about something, he told my dad off, he got drunk and they started arguing. I always got involved. My mom used to cry and I would feel bad for her, so I would also cry and beg my dad to stop. There were times when I didn't wanna go to school or anywhere, because I was afraid I would come home to the same thing. It got to a point where, the moment I heard my mom yell or anything that would make me think that they're arguing again, I got that pit in my stomach and I had to hold back my tears. I know, a lot of parents argue, but it affects every person differently. I started with this part, because I used to think my mom was the victim. My dad was an alcoholic and I blamed him. Now I think the opposite. My mom makes a big deal of everything, all the time, and she yells a lot. That's probably not the best way to summarize why I think she's to blame, but I'm getting there.\n\nI was always considered antisocial, because I didn't have a lot of friends and I wasn't good at socializing. When I was around 9 years old, my best friend at the time and me had a fight over something, then she sat with another girl in school and they made fun of me, throwing stuff at me. I went home and I told my mom, crying and her response was \"It must be your fault, if she's mad at you, you did something. Stop crying, before I slap you so you'll actually have a reason to cry.\" She did slap me sometimes, so I stopped crying. I remember that moment crystal clear, because that was the last time I told her something similar. \n\nI'm trying to think of all the things she's done to me, but I don't think I remember half of it, to be honest. What I do know, is that it has been affecting me more lately. Last week, I stayed up to watch a movie, then I couldn't fall asleep and I ended up crying because of her. I'm almost 20 years old, currently in university, but she still tries to control me. Sometimes I feel bad, because I wouldn't have money without them. Then I remember that I can't do anything without having to think about what she would do. Will she yell at me if I tell her? Will she tell me all the reasons why I'm a bad, ungrateful child? Or will she just accept it? It's not just anxiety. I keep reliving the moments when she yelled at me and she made me wish I was dead. \n\nI can't say I was the \"perfect kid\", because I wasn't. My grades starting dropping in grade 7, I managed to get better in the next year, but from grade 9, they kept getting worse. I was severely depressed and suicidal for 2 years, without anyone knowing, but my mom yelled at me for always being in a bad mood. You might think I'm exaggerating, but I'm not; she yelled at me for the tiniest things and they will haunt me. If I forgot to bring out the trash, I was lazy and I never helped with anything. I cannot say how many times I've heard that I'm ungrateful. That my only job was to study and I couldn't even do that. \n\nI feel like I need more proof, but at the same time, I don't care if people don't believe me. I was damaged mentally by her a lot, I still am, and it's affecting my life. (TW: suicide mention) I keep getting flashback, I keep reliving the moments, when she said she will hang herself if my dad doesn't stop arguing or when I had to take the knife out of her hands. My dad stopped drinking recently and they don't argue that much, but even when they do now, I don't get sad. I get angry, I try to ignore them, but I end up yelling at them. They stole my childhood and I've had enough. The reason I said that I blame my mom now, is that because she's done the same things with my dad as me. It's not just about yelling. She hurt me and she hurt him. I also had a problem with alcohol and smoking last year. I understand why my dad used to use that as an escape. He couldn't deal with my mom. She hasn't changed that much, but I think we can deal with her better now.\n\nI don't know if I'll be able to heal. I've tried so many times and failed. I want to get better, but the child inside me is holding me back. I feel trapped and it hurts so much. I have a best friend that knows these, I usually vent to them, but it can get too much. I have never spoken about this to anyone in real life, even when I tried, no words came out. I just want to be free..\n\nThank you to anyone who reads it. \n\nStay safe! \n\n&#x200B;",

However, there‚Äôs a part of me that wonders if I‚Äôm sexually repulsed due to events I‚Äôll explain in a minute. It might also be a combination of both.\n\nThree events come to mind, and all of them happened during my elementary school years. I haven‚Äôt had an in-depth conversation with anyone about them: the first two have been mentioned to my parents (I‚Äôm a 20-year-old still living at home), but we never sat down and had a full conversation.\n\nEvent One: I had a question for my dad while he was getting out of the shower, and he let me into the bathroom thinking I was my mom. This meant I saw him completely naked, which freaked out and embarrassed both of us.\n\nEvent Two: This is the big one, and the memory I keep coming back to. When I was getting a routine check-up, my pediatrician performed a vaginal exam without warning me first. My mom was in the room, and my pediatrician even mentioned the importance of consent afterward. I don‚Äôt remember anything else bad about that doctor, aside from the usual ‚Äúchild doesn‚Äôt like needles‚Äù.\n\nEvent Three: Around fourth or fifth grade, I went through a period of internet horniness. I never found actual porn (though looking back, that was what I was looking for), nor did I ever masturbate. I just found gratification in watching people kiss and take their shirts off.\n\nOddly enough, PG sex scenes on television and episodes of SVU don‚Äôt bother me (I‚Äôm a big fan of the latter). I‚Äôve even started playing Baldur‚Äôs Gate 3 with the nudity turned on, which is a big accomplishment for me. I just have no desire for sexual gratification, and the thought of anyone going near my genitals freaks me out.\n\nAnyway, that‚Äôs my rant for today. Just wanted to get it out in the ether.",

When I was a kid I went through a lot of mental abuse(narcissistic in nature) and by 15 had learned that I have to rely on myself because I couldn‚Äôt even trust my own family. I got kicked out at 17, came back at 18 and left permanently by 19 to another state entirely. My former best friend, let‚Äôs call him Byron, met when I was 17 at a beach and hit it off well. Even though I moved we stayed in touch where we could. My life definitely went through some ups and downs considering my childhood and even though I tried my best, I still had some narcissistic tendencies and severe emotional and trust issues. I thought I was getting better until a little after my 25th birthday. I had my first ever panic attack, and up until this point I had never really suffered from social anxiety or anxiety of any kind really except maybe having to walk through large crowds. A few months after the panic attacks started I got a bad case of bronchitis and of course that didn‚Äôt help the whole not breathing thing. I started suffering from daily intense brain fog(it‚Äôs been a year now and I still have the brain fog feeling) and that has taken a major toll on my mental health. I‚Äôve been trying my best to process everything I went through and realizing how messed everything was. I‚Äôve always been emotionally distant due to the abuse and emotional abandonment as a child. I‚Äôve been working on it but I definitely not where I need to be. Byron and I live quite a few states away now and we pretty much called almost everyday until Feb 10. I saw that he blocked me on everything except my one extra Facebook account I had planned on slowly swapping to. Long story short, I got ahold of his wife, thinking the worse, to find out he basically wanted nothing to do with me anymore. After a couple weeks of struggling with the mixed emotions of the whole thing I decided to leave him one last video of me saying goodbye without confronting the situation. It‚Äôs a bad habit of mine but I‚Äôd rather break my own heart than let anyone else ever do it again. He left me a voicemail that pretty much said he couldn‚Äôt handle me being in his life anymore. That it was too much. I almost started crying then and there and honestly wish I had just let it out. I was told that a lot as a child especially since I have ADHD and it opened up a wound I didn‚Äôt know was there. My issue now is I keep repressing the emotions as this all unfolds. I‚Äôm trying my best to feel them out and my girlfriend trying really hard to be supportive. I don‚Äôt how to ask for help or what to even ask for. I‚Äôve been my own everything for so long that it‚Äôs hard to accept I might need extra support on this. I can‚Äôt afford therapy. I have two small children I love dearly and don‚Äôt want them to go through even a 1/4 of what I did. But my depression is getting worse and I can feel myself getting distant from everything again.

I remember what it used to feel like to be nervous and anxious all of the time. However, ever since I had that episode I don't even feel anxiety anymore. I can't say that's a good thing because I've become numb to EVERYTHING. I don't want to feel like an emotionless zombie.\n\nI'm trying to regain my ability to feel emotions again, to feel pleasure again, to feel sexual desire again, etc. Since it's been almost 4 years of dealing with this I worry that I won't go back to my old self. My symptoms all stem from that stressful episode; that episode was caused by Body Dysmorphia and Sexual Insecurity.\n\nI've spent a lot of time going to the Doctor and getting tests done to rule out any physical issues. I've had my Hormones checked, I've had Imaging done, etc. Tests kept coming back normal. I've tried 5 different psych medications to no avail: Wellbutrin, Rexulti, Trintellix, Auvelity, and Geodon. \n\nI've had 2 sessions of Somatic Experiencing Therapy. This Practitioner also does IFS, Psychedelic Therapy, and Sex Therapy. She doesn't do EMDR.\n\nThere's another therapist close to me who also does Somatic Experiencing, IFS, and she does EMDR. She doesn't do Sex Therapy or Psychedelic Therapy.\n\nShould I look into trying EMDR or should I stick with my current therapist?\n\nI also will be trying Spravato really soon.",

He called out someone name that isn't mine. I looked behind me and he was right in my face. Immediately I noticed the man was covered in blood and sweat. He proceeded to try and shake my hand and just stared me dead in the eyes. We were in an alley and there was no one in sight. He started eyeing me up and looking me up and down. I was a lot bigger than him. I'm over 6 foot and 300 pounds. He was maybe 130 pounds at best. He then says how he just needed a cigarette as he began rifling through his pockets. I then tell him I can go inside to grab him a vape. I was trying to act like his friend and didn't freak out or grab me phone or act erratic in any way. He followed me up the stairs to my apartment building and as I opened the door I pushed him down the stairs and slammed the door in his face and locked it. He started trying to pry the door open and began screaming. I ran upstairs and called the cops and they arrived in about 5 minutes. I washed off the blood that got on me from trying to push him and him trying to shake my hand. The police came back 30 minutes later saying they caught him at a local grocery store and he's going to jail. He tried to stab and hurt others at the grocery store. I'm super shook up and cant stop thinking about it and now I'm scared to leave my apartment. ",

    "selftext": "I'm a 26-year-old woman who's always had some social anxiety, but I used to be able to manage it and communicate without issues. However, after facing significant trauma last year and losing six close friends, my ability to socialize has drastically decreased. Now, I mainly go to work and then straight home, with little social interaction outside of that. \n\nLately, speaking has become physically difficult for me. It feels like I've lost the natural ability to move my mouth and lips when I talk. It just feels so difficult to be able to physically make those oral motor movements. I'm constantly aware of how my mouth looks when I speak, and producing words feels awkward and forced. This issue seems to be worsening with people I'm not comfortable around, though it varies even with those I am comfortable with.\n\nOn top of this, I've been diagnosed with being on the autism spectrum, OCD (with intrusive thoughts), ADHD, and PTSD within the past year. I was already diagnosed with BPD 2 years ago but I have been in therapy every single week since then and as of right now my triggers and symptoms are manageable. I believe the lack of social interaction, compounded by my recent trauma and diagnoses, has caused a regression in my speech abilities. It's surprising and challenging, especially since I've been relatively high-functioning and was only diagnosed with autism later in life.\n\nNow, I find myself overthinking every aspect of speech, something that seems to come effortlessly to others. At times, it feels nearly impossible.\n\nDoes anyone have advice or has anyone gone through something similar? How do you manage or improve speech and social interaction under these circumstances?",

She has memories telling me ‚Äúit‚Äôs okay, I‚Äôll be okay‚Äù while I cried for her not to be taken away. (This was a family member, not my mother, and no one knew until more than a decade later.) By age 8, my mother and I would argue every single day. She was going through her own sa trauma and was depressed a lot. She would blow up for no reason, never physically abusive and never anything plain hateful, but enough to hurt my feelings and make me sob. She was a big hypocrite and would punish me for things she would do and it always bothered me. I didn‚Äôt make it easy on her though. It never got better. In fact it got worse, especially into my teen years. Where almost every single day without fail we would argue about something that would turn into a screening match of tears and slamming doors. My dad was great, and my mother and father would often argue when he took my side in arguments. My mother would offer me gifts and then use them as collateral as things to take away. When I moved out they offered to pay for college, and all of college I was basically trapped by her constant reminder I couldn‚Äôt do anything she wouldn‚Äôt disapprove of or they would ‚Äúcut me off‚Äù. I know my mother loved us so much, it was just hard for her to show sometimes. My mother and I now have a pretty good relationship. We talk about once a week and have more boundaries in place.

I am newly married, and I am having some internal thoughts that I am wondering if they are caused by some sort of childhood trauma. My husband is perfect, so it‚Äôs me not him. I am wondering what type of trauma (if any) a childhood like this could create‚Ä¶.? ",

    "title": "Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice, an incredible trauma recovery game",
    "selftext": "I searched before making this post, and I couldn't find anyone posting here about Senua's Sacrifice yet. It's, like, the cptsd game :D Let's talk about it!\n\nI had to write a review for a cultural item for a writing composition class. \n\nHere was my take:\n\n---\n\nWhat is the best movie you've seen? \n\nWhat is the best book you have read?\n\nWhat is the best song you have heard?\n\nI always had a hard time answering these questions, but I can tell you what the best game is that I have ever played, and that one is easy. It‚Äôs not a close call.\n\nThat game is Hellblade: Senua‚Äôs Sacrifice, which tells the Story of Senua, a Pict, a people that lived in Scotland up until a thousand years ago. Returning from the woods she finds that Norsemen had come to her shores and laid waste to her home. All were slaughtered, including her beloved, Dillion. This young woman, heartbroken, shattered, sets out on a quest: She will go to Helheim, the Hell of the Norsemen. She will find Dillion, and using his decomposing head as a vessel, she will carry his soul back into the world of the living. \n\nSenua suffered a break with reality. Throughout the game she hears voices and sees people and runes, memories and fears. Her visions are such a fundamental part of her experience that she never questions it. The voices, too, are a constant companion, sometimes a choir of anxiety, hopelessness or of ill humor. It didn‚Äôt take long for me to accept her reality, and her experiences as real.\n\nThis game could have easily been a game about psychosis. The genius of it lies in that it isn‚Äôt. It affects how she deals with the themes the game explores, and how they can be presented. Her world is a metaphor, and her subconscious, and her experiences, and it's an experience of reality as beautiful as it can be horrifying. Her experience isn‚Äôt universal, but what the game tackles is. Anyone can relate to learning to accept yourself, or learning to let go, of having hurt, and finding peace.\n\nMentally ill people also have universal experiences. \n\nWe are not our mental illness.  \n\nThe writers saw that, and I believe, because they treat this topic with such respect, have managed to create a narrative that fosters empathy and understanding for a condition that is very difficult to understand. \n\nSenua has become a champion for the de-stigmatization of mental illness, and also of hope for people with mental illness, that we can be understood. The gap between experiences of reality does not have to mean a gap in understanding.\n\nThis is why it is my best game of all time. No other game has ever made me feel seen.\n\n---\n\nIf you haven't played it, this trailer sets up the presentation and mood very well:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yh-zFCILR4\n\nthis \"accolades trailer\" shows how profound an effect representation of mental illness can have:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39_dzijSmf0\n\nBut this is the big one, the one that has me really excited. Part 1 was all about coming to a place of self compassion, self acceptance. It was about about overcoming internalized self hate of childhood abuse. She steps out of rock bottom into the light, and it sets up part 2, that is stepping out of isolation, and beginning the deep healing work. So, now that I am doing my own cptsd recovery, seeing this trailer for the sequel come out, I'm stoked. It's going to ruin me, in the best of ways :)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmGvuh6cV9E\n\n\"Everything I've seen, everything I've done has led me to this place. We've come so far. Not far enough.\" I feel like that line especially hits me right we're I'm at right now, myself.\n\nHave any of you played it?",

    "selftext": "I haven‚Äôt really posted anything about this stuff before but I feel like I need some outside opinions here. \nI (F23) was the victim of sexual abuse when I was 8 years old by my cousin. What he did is not important to this, but just know that what he forced me to do has given me trauma and PTSD that I have had to deal with for my whole life. \nAnyway, I‚Äôm coming here to post because I don‚Äôt know what to do, if I‚Äôm overthinking something I did in my childhood or not. So basically, when I was young (I‚Äôm almost positive it was before my abuse) I kissed a girl who was my age. (I now identify as heterosexual and am in a healthy relationship with my current boyfriend.) The girl I kissed was the granddaughter of one of my uncles close friends, and we were also friends at the time. When I kissed her, it was only a small kiss when she was laying down, but she had been okay with it and so was I. The problem was, her mom happened to find out and she was upset. I don‚Äôt really remember much after that with regards to that situation.\nThe second thing that happened I can‚Äôt remember if it was before or just after my abuse, but I was still very young and with another girl my age I suggested that we show each other some parts of our body. I don‚Äôt really remember the motivation for that, but I do remember that the girl was slightly nervous because she didn‚Äôt want to miss the bus that she was going to ride. I don‚Äôt think we touched each other, and I don‚Äôt think either of us forced one another to do anything we didn‚Äôt want to do. \nMy issue is this: I feel like I am a terrible person because I think there is a possibility that I may have given one or both of these girls a trauma like I have. I have grown apart from them and they live in different cities and I haven't seen them in years. I don't want to text them or call them about this because I think it's something I should do in person.\nMy boyfriend is telling me that I did nothing wrong and that what I did was simply childish exploration and experimenting and that as long as I didn‚Äôt force anyone to do anything that I am not a bad person. He also says that it is common for survivors of abuse to compare themselves to their abusers (he has also been through abuse and is a psychology major, for reference). I do want to believe him and not think that I‚Äôm a terrible person and not think that I am just like my cousin who forced me to do things to him, but it‚Äôs hard for me to think that way.\nAm I overthinking? Was it just experimenting like any child does? Or have I traumatized people like my cousin did to me? Any advice or suggestions are welcome. ",

    "selftext": "\nI saw a video today about how not everyone can visualise a clear picture of something immediately as they see the word for it. It got me thinking and I remembered how I used to lock my bad memories and forget them as a child.\n\nI was an extremely shy and timid kid. Every time I did something mildly embarrassing or got an adult angry the memory would haunt me for the next three weeks. It didn't  help that I had a very active imagination either so, I'd use to use this method to forget those and other unpleasant memories as well.\n\nThe main reason I came up with this method was because I was SA'd by my neighbour when I was 4. I didn't understand what happened to me at the time, but I knew it was wrong. I was scared to tell my parents or anyone else but the memory ate me up. I hated that it happened to me. I didn't understand why but it made me hate being in my body. And the memory kept replaying in my head over and over, sometimes making me lose sleep because everytime I closed my eyes I'd see it again, scene by scene. \n\nThat's when I created a place in my head. It\nit looked like the inside of a box with four walls that looked like old rustic paper. The walls were also like panels that you could slide away. \n\nWhenever I wanted to forget a memory I'd go here. I never saw myself entering though, I'd just be standing in front of the front middle wall. I would then picture the memory I want to forget and project it onto the wall in front of me, slide the panel away and leave the headspace.\n \nThis worked well for all the other memories I kept in there. It worked so well that I forgot about this method for the past 16 years. All the memories I kept in this box, I'd either completely forget or forget the details and only remembered they happened but not how or what exactly happened. But I couldn't forget the one thing I wanted to forget in the first place. I never did.\n\nI stopped doing it after we moved to a different place. Not on purpose though, i just forgot about it completely and I've forgotten about it ever since except a few minutes ago.\n\nI was wondering if it was a normal thing or if it was my mind's way of coping.\n",

But she threatened me not to talk to me and play with me ever again, and as a small child i was, i was scared of losing her, so i did what she asked me to. I hated it, it all felt weird, disgusting and awkward but she wouldnt let me stop until she said so. After that, she told me not to tell anyone or she wouldnt talk to me again. So i did what she told me to. This kept going on for about 1-2 more years. Each time i didnt want to but she would always threaten me. It stopped when she went to middle school, since she didnt want to play with her younger sister as she grew older. I forgot about it for a few years, but i started remembering it again and now its bothering me all the time. I dont like when people touch me or hug me. I especially dont like when my sister visits because i have to hug her and i really dont want to. Now i am 18 years old and she is 23. I dont think she remembers, and i dont want to remind her that. I am now scared of sex or too many sexual things. Im scared and jealous because all my friends are talking to me about their sex life, while i cant.",

    "selftext": "So I (M) am going to talk about my childhood, and how it‚Äôs been going since the age of 5 (14 now) \n\nAt the age of five I was taken into foster care due to my mother being an alcoholic(and still is to this day.) I was at my grandfather‚Äôs the day it happened, I was taken away, not knowing about anything that was happening, and taken to my first of three homes\n\nFor the sake of privacy I won‚Äôt say names, but let‚Äôs call the foster parents FP1(f) FP2(m) and my foster brother (FB.)\n\nAs I arrived at my new home, I had been crying the whole time, with no comfort given to me.\nThis new home I went to was all around great, but something I have yet to mention is MY family, which consists of; Younger Half Brother(+father and stepmother), Younger Half sister(+father and stepmother), mother, granda(+nonbiological grandmother, his current wife),biological grandmother (his ex.)\n\nI ended up living in this home for two years, but at around the 1.5 year mark, I started to see my half brothers grandparents, which is the worst thing I could‚Äôve ever done.\n\nAt the two year mark, (Primary 3,) I was offered to go live with these ‚Äúgrandparents‚Äù and I accepted, as I believed it would be a great way to keep in contact with my half brother (who lived 2 minutes up the road with dad and step mum) so on the moving day, we said our goodbyes (still keep in contact) and off I went to home 2.\n\nThis home I loved in for 6 years, and it was the worst experience I think I‚Äôll ever have to go through. So I (7) had just moved in,and for the first 2 months or so, it was great.\nI‚Äôll call these grandparents: E(Female), J(Male), and my half brothers aunty N(who lived in the same house.)\n\nAs I talked about the first two months, I‚Äôll continue on, so gradually as time went on and on, I got ignored more and more, and eventually had to learn to use the oven (at the age of 7) and cooked my own meals every day for the next six years. But, I was not only ignored, but If my HB(half brother) came around, he was always put first, and prioritised.\nHe would always start fights, and it would end with me getting yelled at by E for 20 minutes about being told to get along with my HB.\n\nBut as time went on, so did I, getting used to the quiet lifestyle. After about a year of living there, I was allowed to see my granda for the first time since going into foster care. Once a month was our allowed visits.\n\nLiving there I basically raised myself, as I never got help with schoolwork, and had everything done by myself. Skipping forward, at about the 4 year mark, HB‚Äôs father had had a child with his stepmum for about 2 years. I was very close to HB‚Äôs stepmum and daughter.\n\nOne day N took me,HB and his stepsister out to shop(around Christmas time) so me and HB were around looking at toys, and N and stepsister were together. Once we were done in the shop, stepsister had been bought a toy car(important later) and we went home.\nStepmum had already gotten stepsister the exact toy for Christmas already, and N knew about it, so it was done on purpose. \n\nLater that day, N called me and HB into her room, and told us that she was going to give us ¬£10 each to lie to stepmum and say that we got stepsister the car, which we agreed to(me not wanting to.)\n\nLater that week we went to HB‚Äôs house with stepmum, he was upstairs, me and her downstairs, and I felt bad about lying to her, so I told her everything. Later on I went home, and had to tell E, that I ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù told stepmum about the car, which resulted with me getting yelled at. \n\nI‚Äôve been writing for 45 minutes, so I‚Äôll update if many people see this.",

All of my research always leads back to ‚Äúget therapy!‚Äù But I don‚Äôt even have the willpower for a job right now, so I have no insurance. I signed up on a waitlist for 12 free counseling sessions through my county. I‚Äôve been waiting since October and am still not sure when I‚Äôm going to be seen. I think I‚Äôm realizing I have all sorts of unresolved trauma that started with depression that I‚Äôve probably had since I was a teenager. \n\nMy mom was addicted to pain pills, often times taking so much she would nod off and urinate, or run away into the woods nearby. She had been hospitalized at one point and was doing okay for a few months until her biological dad got sick and died (she had only found out about him a few years before). She was staying with my aunt and was taking care of her father while he was dying of throat cancer, since they lived 4-5 hours away. The morning of his funeral, we arrived early, only to be told that Mom died in the night and my uncle, who also had cancer at the time, was missing a bunch of pills. I don‚Äôt remember what they were, but I was 18 and had just started college. \n\nI should have realized my grief wasn‚Äôt normal when I was making stupid, impulsive decisions for the next 9 years of my life, often to my detriment. I broke work policies and got fired. I dated two drug addicts in a row, I suspect to try to fix them like I could never fix my mother. I had all of my money stolen from me, and was even almost kidnapped. Once I hit my lowest, I had to move back to my dad‚Äôs for a year and start all over again.\n\nI started to get my shit together in 2018. I worked hard enough to save up enough to move back to the city, I got an interesting new job, and met an actual great guy, whom I‚Äôm still dating. \n\nIn 2021, a woman who was like a second mom to me (I had known her since I was 15) passed away unexpectedly, about 2 years after her husband died of cancer. That was fairly rough, but just as I was finally accepting that, in September of this past year, my best friend, one of my cousins I grew up with, unalived herself. She was 28 and buried on my 32nd birthday.  \n\nSince then, I‚Äôve quit my job. Thank the lort for my bf. Everything is so overwhelming-just doing daily activities, like brushing my teeth, leaving the apartment, or interacting with humans. I know I need to get a job soon, but I feel like I‚Äôm terrified of any actions, any outcomes. I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm not mentally fit enough for people to understand my mindset and want anything to do with me, especially hiring managers. Does anyone have any helpful advice? Thank you for reading my rant, this isn‚Äôt everything traumatizing that I‚Äôve experienced, just the major ones.",

    "title": "Is it normal for doctors to do this? How can I feel safe?",
    "selftext": "\nWhen I was 9 I spent a week in the hospital. I haven't thought about it in a long time, but recently some memories have been coming back as I've had to go to the doctor more often, and I'm having a hard time. Some things happened during my stay that as a child, I didn't know weren't ok.\n\nI needed an IV. The needle slipped at some point towards the end of my stay, and I was told it needed to be re-placed. This happened very early in the morning before my parents would arrive, it might have even been before visiting hours. I was really scared of needles. I asked to wait until my parents got there to do the procedure, but was told it could not wait. I was brought into the office and sat down. There were several doctors and nurses around me. I put my arm out for the needle, and sat still and tried to be as brave as I could. They poked my arm, but could not find my vein. I was told \"ok, just once more \" and I sat still while the missed my vein again. They tried at least 9 times, up both my arms. At some point I started begging for them to wait for my parents to be there with me, and was told I was too old for that. When I started crying I was held down from both sides while they tried again to find a vein. Eventually I was sent back to my with no IV. My parents arrived soon after, snd I was also told that I was well enough not to need an IV. I thought it was a bad dream at first, and I think my parents might have too, but there were welts on my arms. I have had to get over my fear of needles, but I am very scared of hospitals and medical situations.\n\nAnother thing that happened during that hospital stay: there was one doctor I remember who was very tall, and had big square glasses. He always gave me the creeps. I didn't know why, or how to explain it as a kid. At some point, i woke up in the middle of the night. The privacy curtain around my bed was drawn almost shut. This curtain was solid fabric up until above the height of most people, and above was a wide mesh like material. I could see the outline of a person's head peeping just above the fabric line of the curtain, and a little bit of light shone off a pair of square glasses. I laid there pretending to sleep, but I'm pretty sure I was doing a very bad job. He stayed there, standing on his toes so he could peek over the curtain for a little while longer, and then silently left. I understand checking in on patients, especially kids, but the length of time he stared, and the way he was watching me left me feeling very scared. I still don't understand why he didn't just look in through the gap in the curtain. Almost like he was hoping I wouldn't see him.\n\nI had been touched inappropriately by doctors before this. I have never told anyone other than my husband, and the details are so fuzzy sometimes I doubt it even happened. It terrifies me to think of what I might have made myself forget.\n\nI have come to accept I'm struggling with this more than I realized. This was over 20 years ago, and now I am having to visit my doctor more often for chronic illnesses. I always feel like I struggle to communicate effectively with my GP because I am spending so much effort on being present and not freaking out. I have tried therapy, and seeing a psychiatrist in the past but I will never feel safe or comfortable around the medical establishment. \n\nPlease, if anyone has advice on how to better advocate for yourself in a medical setting, I would love to hear from you.\nThanks \n",

    "selftext": "So I have been to multiple childhood trauma therapists and every single one has never heard of this and it makes it so much harder on me...\n\n(I am currently 30 years old)\n\nMy mom remarried when I was five years old, and I had no say in moving in with my stepdad and mom at that time. At the young age of five, I remember feeling unhappy¬†over this decision my mom made. To make a long story short, my mom claims he was cutting her hair while she was sleeping at night because she said, During this time, she claims he commented on how beautiful her hair was, and he was jealous of the attention/stares she was receiving from men.\n\nThe situation escalated to the point that she began forcing me to sleep on the floor next to the locked door next to her¬†in a separate room every night, and she stopped sharing a bedroom with him. Every night, she would wake me up¬†screaming and run her fingers through her hair, shaking me to wake me up. \"Look what he did to my hair!!\" You see that he cut some of¬†my hair! I could never sleep during the night, and I began to wake up vomiting¬†every morning and wetting the bed at night (from anxiety). I remember being so afraid and worried about what was happening.\n\nDespite my knowing that something wasn't quite right, this began to become my new \"normal\". Not only did things not get better, but she continued to have us sleep in a tiny tent with zippers locked to prevent him from cutting our hair. Later, along with yelling and arguing every day, my mom and stepdad started having physical altercations that I remember always jumping into the middle of trying to stop the physical fights. She then began accusing him of cheating and seeing other women. Later, she claimed he was adding \"chemicals\" to our shampoo bottles, and she began forcing¬†me to hide them as well. She also taught me that¬†I should never turn my back on him or my step-sister since they were both involved in cutting our hair while we were¬†asleep and putting chemicals in our shampoo.\n\nThis unfortunately went on for over 10 years.. my mom always had an excuse to not leave and I remember always sleeping at different family members' houses off and on because I hated being at home. I always gave my mom the benefit of the doubt and everyone in my family would always say that my stepdad was such a \"nice guy\" even though I always saw a very scary side of him behind closed doors. None of my family ever believed me and even worse none of my family ever tried to take me out of that horrible living environment.\n\nI just want to know if anyone has experienced something similar or if anyone knows if there is a term for someone who cuts their spouse's hair at night or puts chemicals in their shampoo bottles. Any feedback is welcome. Thank you all in advance.",

I had a small wall in my room written on by people close to me, like friends who helped me through a codeine addiction, my cousins, my brother whos currently working out of the country who is honestly my rock, my bf whos helping me through this all and some quotes that mean a lot to me along with some song lyrics and doodles.\n\nMy ma told me it looked like a crackden, it looked messy and made me look like a schizo. She said because i have issues with my sleep i cant have things on my walls (even though you cant see this wall from my bed). \n\nShe knows how much this all meant to me, yet tore it away because she didnt like it. And it sounds stupid but that wall was the only thing i had control over, she mocks my makeup (slightly grunge-y?), my friends, the fact i smoke, she controls where i go who i go out with which activities i do even tried to make me block my best friend because i smoked weed with her. \n\nAfter i came home to see all my stuff moved, my walls painted over, all my things and trinkets from my ‚Äúadventures‚Äù gone. I just started bawling. I had expressed how i felt about my room for weeks as she kept nagging on about ‚Äúredecorating‚Äù. \n\nShe tried to hug me and say ‚Äúi didnt mean to upset you‚Äù, but she does this every single time.\n\nShe goes behind my back and does something ive expressed that im not okay with and tries to hug me. I cannot stand it. \n\nAnyways, at about 11:30pm that night, after years of just pure bullshit and already struggling mentally, months of struggling with substances and feeling like dead weight, i decided to try to kill myself with the 3.75 yokes (ecstasy pills) i had left. \n\nThis was approximately 800mg of mdma. An mdma dose is between 80-120mg. \n\nAt the start, i felt so euphoric. Then at about 2am, it all fell apart. \n\nI turned to my left and saw an older woman lying there, pointing at the wall where everything had been. I began to talk to her about it, but soon the left side of her face began to droop, as if she was having a stroke. I was terrified.\n\nHer face continued to droop down onto her chest, only the left side, as her eyes fell out and her hair disappeared. Her skin felt like sandpaper and she was so cold.\n\nI lost it. I thought it was real, so i began screaming for an ambulance to help her. She began melting and sliding off under my bed as i ran out of my room for help. I burst into my mas room and told her theres someone in my bed and theyre not ok. My ma made me sleep in her room. She knew. \n\nThe next morning she inspected me, went through my phone and found out what i had done.\n\nI got caught sniffing ket in december, so it wasnt good for me.\n\nShe rang my da who drove our ,came upstairs, called me selfish and accused me of being a hooker and then of being  a heroin addict. I just started screaming for him to get out because i had just tried to kill myself and thats what he had to say.\n\nIm laying in bed with my dog right now, my mates are all supporting me and helping me work through this but no matter what i do and how logic goes against it, i cant help but think that thing was real, and its under my bed or about my house right now.\n\nI did not see it leave, i saw it hide. And i am terrified. I keep coming up with these ideas like its an infection and it will get to me or my dog or my brother and we will melt too, or if its an omen, or if its some sort of demon out to get me, but every single creak i hear, i am terrified.\n\nI havent been to hospital or anything, im just thugging this shit out.\n\nsorry its a long read but i had to explain.",

    "selftext": "If this is not technically trauma, please let me know. I do not currently have the money to go to a therapist and get a more professional perspective on this problem. I've only just realized how deep it goes in me, and how important it is that I find a solution for it.\n\nI feel a very deep need for certainty or reliability. I need to know that the thing which I rely upon to get what I need will always be there when I need it. This applies in specific instances in life, and on a broad intellectual level, becoming an ongoing existential crisis.\n\nI think this started when I was a kid. I had night terrors, and I called out for my parents. They would come to my room and sit by me for a bit, but then leave and tell me I was fine. I hated that; it made me feel very lonely. They also told me I would stop being afraid, and while I did stop having night terrors, I retain a notable fear of the dark to this very day which makes going to bed an uncomfortable experience.\n\nAfter that, throughout my life, I had this perspective of unreliability reinforced many times. Leaders at my church tried to help me, but were never able to. I took Christianity very seriously, and so I asked, how do we KNOW that this is true? And after several years of research and contemplation I realized that we didn't. There were video games I loved, virtual worlds that felt like home to me, and then the companies which owned them altered them in ways which cut out the heart of it. And of course, I've failed myself more times than I can remember.\n\nThat's the short version. I'm writing sort of clinically about this, but I have a very emotional need for certainty now, to know for sure how I will get what I need. \"Need\" here doesn't just mean physical needs; perhaps even more than that, it means interpersonal needs. It's something which causes me a LOT of problems in my life. I'm unwilling to do things if I'm uncertain that they're worthwhile, or if I'm uncertain that the plan will work, which leads me to not doing much of anything. Feeling like I'm constantly insecure, always un-grounded, is anxiety-inducing and paralyzing. I can't take risks, but everything is a risk. I've put a ton of thought into finding something to rely upon and I've been increasingly coming to the conclusion that such certainty cannot exist; it is literally unknowable to a moral mind.\n\nSo, I really don't know what to do. I can't think of any solution but blinding myself (metaphorically speaking), entering a state of constant stress burnout by just taking risks literally all the time, or embracing going crazy (which would be likely to actually kill me). I should also be clear that I'm not entirely non-functional right now. I do have a job, and I have friends I talk with. But this problem has been getting worse and lately it's been making it very hard for me to maintain my job or pursue a better one. I've gotten to frightening lows of depression which I didn't know I was capable of. I need something different, and I've run out of places to look, so I'm asking here.",

    "selftext": "22F, grew up in an obsessively puritan religious family, was a virgin until 21 bc of other traumas making me afraid of intimacy. Got into my first serious relationship when I was 20 and because i was so starstruck w the person i didnt realize the relationship was unhealthy, specifically from a sexual pov.\n\nBasically, I didn't initiate anything w her for a few months (fear of intimacy) so she did. She then accused me of having assaulted her (she admitted after the relationship was over that this was just her projecting her own trauma onto me) and stopped every form of sexual engagement with me. We didnt break up because I didnt wanna break up with \"the love of my life\" over \"something as unimportant as sex\" (I was and probably still am naive at best and stupid at worst), so we basically spent about a year just trying to fix the unfixable.\n\nDuring the year, I expressed to her several times how important it was for me to pick up our sexual relationship again and she always said she was gonna change and put effort into it (never delivered). In the meantime, I pretty much became unable to touch myself without crying because I strongly associated / associate sex with her and I felt ashamed for \"assaulting\" her and i grieved a connection that I felt was no longer reachable. I became pretty desperate and started sending pictures and videos and other stuff to her that I was uncomfortable doing but thought would help us spice things up, but it always earned me nothing more than a couple of \"wow youre so hot !!\" texts (she later admitted she did use these to get off, she just never interacted w me or let me know, which added to the feeling of disgust towards myself, as well as an overall feeing of being little more special than pornhub).\n\nWhen I finally gave her an ultimatum regarding having a serious conversation about the matter she broke up with me saying I didn't care about having traumatized her (at the time, the last time we had sex had been 10 months prior).\n\nNow it's been almost six months since the breakup and I'm realizing my fear of intimacy, which I thought I beat, is back and stronger than ever. In fact the idea of someone even being sexually interested in me makes me wanna puke. Self pleasuring is also rare and pretty much just annoying, being how the only thing that seems to get me enough turned on is thoughts of my ex (so most of it is spent arguing with my brain because I shouldn't think about her and arguing with my ex in my brain and then I'm both not turned on and also sad). Specifically I've started to notice it physically hurts to touch myself which I've read is a sign of sexual trauma so I thought I'd sit down and figure this out.\n\nI've had bad experiences with therapists so I figured I'd try reddit before professional help. If I try looking up advice all I see are resources for victims of r\\*pe, SA or CSA, and while I don't think my issue is as serious I do need help.\n\nTLDR: I got my trust broken by someone I trusted w my body and now I'm repulsed by my own sexuality, I can't find resources to help myself so I'm asking reddit before I turn to therapy.\n\nPs: Please don't suggest just \"having a random hookup\" unless you can also add advice on how to do this as someone who is terrified of getting touched and would rather not cry all over a stranger or have a panic attack in front of them.",

Life is okay and I am sorted on the family front but I fear ending up and dying alone or people treating me like use-and-throw. The root for that could be that I was abandoned by my childhood friends, later on college/ other friends, my crush and then my boyfriend (during covid). I worked on myself a lot after, trying to avoid seeking outer validation and being comfortable in my skin. As a result of that I started to live in solitude. I thought solitude is my solace because I always felt alone in a group of friends or colleagues which used to hurt. But lately being solitary has also started to hurt badly. I am a people-pleaser hoping that other people find value in me and won‚Äôt leave me as a result. I am insecure and I have this constant urge to apologise. I feel that I am not required or needed by the people/group around and my very existence or presence is a bother to them. Hence, I am always kind and sweet to them even when I am not feeling like it. Showing my true emotions might make them leave me.\n\nI am single and I am at that age where I am ready to get married but haven‚Äôt found the right person yet. I don‚Äôt want my future relationship to end up like my past one. I look at men around me who are nice and have ‚Äúrelatable‚Äù past (like falling in love with like minded people sharing a ‚Äútrauma bond‚Äù - I feel it‚Äôs a relationship goldmine) and I start crushing over them to certain extremes that when reality hits, that one sided relationship hurts just like the breakup, if not less. Currently it‚Äôs happening to me with one of my coworkers who is a good friend and with whom I connect so deeply on emotional level that I have been fantasising my potential partner in him. And seeing him spend time with other coworkers (females esp) and sometimes ignoring my texts or calls gives me a pit in my stomach. And this was the trigger of my latest breakdown that happened yesterday.\n\n\nOn the professional front I have a job but I have been trying to change it for the past 10 months but I still have not reached anywhere. It‚Äôs 10 month (running) worth of constant hard work and rejection and the feeling of being a loser in this front too. Every time I feel positive about any job interview, I am rejected or ghosted in the end. Job hunt is a major cesspool of negative emotions, details of which are equally disappointing but in short, it has been triggering my breakdowns a lot as well.\n\nI am so overwhelmed with these feelings of being a loser or an overthinker who has abandonment issues and low self esteem- that I have sudden outbursts and I start crying. I did therapy, meditation , found a hobby etc. 4 years ago when certain events actually occurred in my life and started to impact me mentally. I worked on it and came out strong and I was sure I‚Äôll be able to tackle if any of these feelings or situations arise again. But now I feel I have accomplished nothing and I might go down that spiral again.\n\nWhen everyone around me seems to be moving ahead in life, I am still stuck in same relationship status or job status and what‚Äôs worse mentally I‚Äôm spiralling back.\n\nI know life could be worse and I am grateful for everything I have at present and maybe it‚Äôs all in my head but still I need help in order to move ahead.\n\nWhat do I do?

He was a 100 kg monstrosity at that time and getting some 20 heavy hits from him was unimaginably traumatizing for a 9 yr old.\n\nNow coming to my mother. Those regular slaps and beatings were almost like a schedule to happen, I just needed to fuck up at something. But I remember this one incident that was so upsetting that my young brain had probably removed it from my memory as a coping mechanism. I was only able to recall it maybe a few months ago. \nSo I don't even remember how old I was but definitely less than 7. I don't remember the exact reason but my mother slapped me multiple times after which I fell on the floor and then she kicked the crap out of me while I was lying down. Easily 6 to 7 kicks were landed on me. What I do remember is the feeling which was almost as if my whole body was going past pain and getting numb.\n\nNow due to all this shit in the past that I realized now, I'm unable to see my parents in the same way.\nAlso while I was a teenager and when I was in college, I realized I usually think way too much before taking any risk, no matter how small it is.

Things got better over time. I don't hold a grudge. \n\n\nI guess the earliest memory of any sort of trauma comes from when I was roughly seven or so. I was molested at that age by a non-family member. I don't remember much of the details. That was decades ago. \n\nI hid that from my parents. I still do, to some extent. Maybe if it was a bit more relevant to my life now, I would share but for now it just never comes up as relevant. If they know, it is not because I told them. \n\nMy grandmother (mother's side) died of pneumonia while my mother was deployed just after 9/11 that same year. I held her hand during her passing. It was not pleasant but at least she wasn't alone. \n\nA particular moment sticks out in my mind of my mother talking to me before she left. My adoptive father, also military, was deployed as well though he was already divorced from her by then. My uncles, at least three of them, and one aunt, deployed as well that year. Not all of them made it home. \n\nMy mother, before deploying, told me that it was my job while everyone was gone to defend my younger brother. In addition, she said that \"if necessary, you will give your life in his defense\". I am the eldest of eight now. He was my only brother back then. \n\nI grew up bullied and isolated. Well before any of this happened, really. I made mistakes trying to socialize at that age. Probably not surprising, given I had barely any parental supervision until I was a teenager (which seems ass backward to me but whatever). Socializing is still not my thing. \n\nI was thirteen when I was first stabbed. Some random teenager picked a fight with my brother (we were unsupervised yet again and far from home). I told him to run, and as he did I fought to hold back his attacker. I did not realize I had been injured until I got away. I crawled roughly two miles or so from the bridge we were playing at. I passed out along the way and only survived because someone that lived in the area saw me (my intestines were exposed) and called an ambulance. I can't say the experience was pleasant but looking back, I am a little surprised it did not hurt very much (shock?). \n\nI graduated high-school at seventeen, graduating a year early with honors and a few AP classes under my belt. That same day, I enlisted into the military as an Infantryman (11-B). I graduated basic and OSUT the following year. \n\nWhile in the service, I sustained numerous injuries due to a car accident that led, ultimately, to a discharge. \n\nI wandered for a while and did odd jobs here and there to make ends meet. Eventually, I worked my way through college. \n\nDuring that time, I met my now wife. Her mother was abusive, much worse than my own who (in my opinion) was neglectful. We've been married now for years and are still going strong. I think the day I married her was the best day. \n\nI graduated from college. There are still sleepless nights. There are still times when I think of everything I have gone through.

I often suspect I have ADHD as well, but the symptoms overlap so much with CPTSD that I don't know. I have managed somehow to keep it together enough to get a university degree and build a career in a creative industry doing something I'm super passionate about, I am married and I've moved abroad to be with my husband, I've done hard things and been through so much. I've done years of therapy and recently have been focusing on trauma therapy for the past year, and have been really healing a lot, which has been exhausting.\n\nBut my biggest weakness/fear is anything to do with finances/beaurocracy, specifically taxes (but not limited to.) As a result, I've consistently ended up in scenarios over the years where my avoidance is so extreme that I've landed in crisis after crisis, trouble after trouble. My fear and overwhelm is so huge that even thinking about it gives me a spike of anxiety, and my avoidance behaviours are through the roof. Right now I'm having to deal with 6 years of non-filing in one country, 2 years in the other, unpaid health insurances and being broke with no way out. I work hard, and have made good money in the past, but my avoidance has led to me never living with a budget and being completely blind to my money, despite not being a big spender or eggregiously irresponsible. I've managed to get out of repeat debt and beaurocratic trouble from sheer luck and desperately throwing money at the problem the moment I get it, but I'm getting tired of living this way. \n\nI cannot describe how much despair, fear and shame I feel about these topics, and despite being in therapy for years, working so much on my trauma and my nervous system and understanding myself, I still feel like the experience of dealing with these topics is borderline excruciating. It gets really dark, which as I'm writing right now makes me really sad because I realize that I genuinely believe I'm a terrible person for being this way. I know logically many tools, somatic, breathing, exercise, temperature, talking to someone, telling myself I'm safe, etc. For some reason the shame is just so so deep and overwhelming that it's like they don't work, I don't even believe I deserve to not feel shame about it. People have suggested that maybe I'm addicted to the shame. I could be, I suppose, but in all honesty I spend every waking moment trying to avoid feeling it. That's why I'm in these situations.\n\nI don't know if it will ever go away and I feel helpless to it. I know I shouldn't, I know I should do things that make me feel empowered and capable, and eventually when it gets bad enough I am forced to face it and then I experience a period of relief before desperately wanting to avoid again.\n\nI guess I'm just wondering if its truly even possible for this to go away, or if I'm not alone.

The city I live in, a former safe space, has become a minefield of potential \"off\" sensations.

We lost our house because she stopped working and my dad couldn‚Äôt keep up with a mortgage on his own. \n\nAt the height of her addiction, I wouldn‚Äôt hear from her unless she needed money. At that time I was 19-22 years old. If I didn‚Äôt give her what she wanted, she‚Äôd verbally berate me and make me feel like I was a terrible person. She eventually became homeless for awhile. \n\nEvery person in her life who cared about her she has pushed away because they stopped enabling her. She even withheld me from seeing my grandparents for a large chunk of my life because they were ‚Äúhorrible and dangerous people‚Äù. She used me a lot for her own gain. \n\nWe barely have a relationship now, but i have felt that I needed to be the one person who stayed in contact with her out of pure guilt. But, recently, after not seeing her for over a year, I came home to visit and she cancelled her plan to see me because she was too depressed because her life was horrible.\n\nI got really upset about this. I never hear from her. My whole life I‚Äôve always had to be the person to listen to all of her problems and struggles. Looking back, I‚Äôve realized that she was never truly there for me a way a mom should be. She causes me so much pain and I‚Äôm exhausted at this point.\n\nI have trauma stemming from this. And I want to start healing from it. I think I finally want to just stop communicating with her. Would I be a terrible daughter to do so? I just feel like at this point, I‚Äôve done everything I could and more than a kid should be expected to do. \n\nI want to be at peace in my life. I‚Äôm in my thirties now and it‚Äôs time that I have peace.",

I am so happy about it and I‚Äôm feeling more comfortable having her to fall back on if I don‚Äôt find a job and have to sell my house. But my wife isn‚Äôt happy about that. She doesn‚Äôt want to discuss the possibility. It‚Äôs because my mom treated me poorly when I was growing up and because she is taking longer to accept the fact that I (AFAB) am married to a trans woman. My wife says that any time we visit and she‚Äôs dressed very girly she notices my mom glaring at her. I‚Äôve never noticed that but my mom tends to just glare no matter what‚Äôs going on. It‚Äôs worse when she‚Äôs overwhelmed/overstimulated and the holidays with two toddlers will do that to a person. Her random glaring caused a lot of miss communication when I was growing up that‚Äôs for sure. I‚Äôve been staying with her for the last week because the heat went out in my house but my wife decided to stay there. She‚Äôd rather sleep in a cold home and barely have money for food than to stay a single night here where it‚Äôs warm and we have food. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm going to do here. \n\n\n\n\nThe other thing going on is that my dad has collapsed twice that I know of. The first time was back in September. We were having a bonfire and he said the heat/smoke was getting to him. It happened again today in the kitchen. He never lost consciousness he just collapsed and stayed there for a few minutes until he was able to get up again. He‚Äôs always drinking water so he‚Äôs not dehydrated. I‚Äôve got no idea what is going on and he won‚Äôt go see the dr until we have no choice but to call an ambulance. I‚Äôm very concerned about him. I‚Äôm debating asking my nana to talk to him about it. See if she can convince him to see a dr. I‚Äôll probably give my mom some time to talk to him first. That‚Äôs another reason I‚Äôm debating moving back in. My sister still lives here but so does my grandmother who needs help day to day. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm going to do.

    "selftext": "Lately I've been having a very rough time from something I believe I've been trying to repress after it happened but lately can't control my emotions about.\n\n2 years ago this coming spring I confessed to a \"best\" friend of mine that I had been the one sending them hurtful messages and fake interactions from second numbers/social medias (I sent maybe 10 messages in the span of a year and a half. It happened when we were still teens but fresh into adulthood 17-19ish) We had been friends since childhood and were always on and off of rocky grounds with each other one of us always causing a petty fuss going in and out of friendship once hitting our teens. We both had bad up bringings and they definitely were dealing with plenty of trauma prior to my actions. Me just adding more.\n\nThey would come to me about these messages and I would lie and say I would never do such a thing, that it must be one of their other friends. They were never messages of threatening to hurt them or that they should hurt themselves. But I would write bizarre and cruel things to them knowing it would get under their skin, i.e. about looks their identity trying to make them dislike they're s/o or other close friends. I confessed to my friend and wrote a huge long apology to them and mentioned I was sorry to their s/o too considering the burden I just caused. I wasn't looking for forgiveness from them or even a response back. I just wanted to own up to what I did after realizing how shameful and demonish i felt and express how truly upset I was with myself and that they didn't deserve the treatment from a so called friend. I wanted them to be able to move on from this and from me and my actions so I poured my guts out to them about what I did.\n\nAlthough I hadn't heard from them since the day I confessed these horrific acts. -They wrote back saying they had a feeling it was me and that they hope I get help and know that they could ruin my life back at any moment-. Which was a very warranted response. I still live daily scared, upset, shameful, and so so so so guilty for what I did. I have no clue WHY I would do this to them I have tried coming up with a reason jealousy, mental health issues, feeling abandoned. I have no clue maybe all of the above.  But I feel like I can't live past this it's all that clouds my head everyday all day effecting my work and school now, which in Karma's sake serves me right as this is how they felt if not worse. On a new note im getting into a therapist now since myself care and worth are in the toilet and I try hard daily to better myself, I have yet to make a new friend since this I just feel as though I can't, so on top of all the guilt I feel I'm also quite lonely. I don't know how to live past this, my actions haunt me. And I hope they are doing way better now and are living to their full compacity now that I'm not around to drag them down.\n\nI feel as though I have no right to be upset over this situation that I did or caused but I can barely function I'm so upset at myself still to this day.",

    "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI'm having problems when I am experiencing tension in the body coming from stress, guilt or anxiousness. When I am feeling stress, tension, negativity, or more specifically guilt or self-judgement, I notice that I don't want to face these feelings. I don't want to FEEL these feelings. I think in a way, they scare me. I don't want to feel sad. I don't want to feel guilt. Regret. Sadness. Fear. Anger. Anxiety. Etc. I don't want to cry.\n\nEnd of last year, I suddenly woken up and finally acknowledge to myself that I can not handle these emotions in a healthy way. I repress them, relentlessly. And I recently realized that I have been doing so most of my life if not all. I distract myself but later these feelings will come back even stronger and I never heal them. I'm 24 now and this year I want to work on healing this part in me.\n\nDo you know ways for me to learn how to face these feelings?\n\nI am normally quite good on the self-love part, but I am apparently not so capable of showing that self love to myself when these emotions get a hold on me and create tension inside of me. Then it builds up until I fall and break.\n\nAny advice on what I can do to improve how I deal with emotions? I have so much, I feel, and I want to be able to feel these feelings and cope with them in a healthier way.\n\n* The following below is me literally pouring my heart out and rambling on about what bothers me here.  I never truly opened up about this issue, which I think is probably inherently part of the repression so the fact that I posted this now is something really big for me.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**My parents**\n\nI realized that in my childhood, my parents also appeared to struggle with emotions. My dad doesn't show (negative) emotions at all until he would burst. My mom would be nice, until she would burn out and scream. My dad would be completely silent completely, when you can see he is hurt. I already saw that when I was very young. He wouldn't hug. Mom would explain to me why he wouldn't hug me, it was because he had a tough life where his parents didn't let him show emotions at all and would punish him for it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How I handled emotions as a kid**\n\nMy mom would tell me I was 'cocooning' again when I would curl up on the couch and 'not wanna do anything'. She would get me out of a rut. But I would be struggling with the bad emotions still. She would try to help getting 'it' out of me, to find out what is wrong. But I wouldn't be able to clear up what was bothering me. Sometimes she would have me literally just cry out loud, and let me punch the feeling out in a pillow. She really tried and I love her. She told me on a long phone call last year how she also wondered how I dealt with negative situations. Family members I loved SO much would pass away after years of being sick and I would appear to be dealing fine, and move on. But thinking back on it now, I have felt so horribly sad and because of me not sharing these emotions, I had moments where I felt ever so lonely in this world.\n\nWhen I grew older, I noticed I how I hadn't cried in years. I felt bad for crying. Apparently I learned in my youth that I had to be strong. I wanted people to think of me, and know me, as a happy person. As a kid, I remember I wanted to live happy, so therefore I shut out all the emotions that aren't \"happy emotions\". I identified myself as a happy person even. Maybe that is something I have in a way, continued doing until now, but I just don't want to fully realize that yet.\n\nI know very well how to push emotions away and to continue life as if nothing happened. I am seen as a 'happy extroverted' fun person, and most of the time I feel that way. But I have infinite memories of moments when I was 'happy' when deep down I had something that hurt me that I just wouldn't mention, just not thing about, just not feel it. I didn't want to feel it.\n\nAnd honestly guys, I am doing good. It's just,  I just noticed this problem and I am now here, putting 2 and 2 together and seeing how these issues evolved over the years. It is like I just woke up to them.\n\n**Now that I'm in my 20's I realize how it puts me in a bad spot**\n\nNow that I'm in my 20's I see how I have made several bad decisions in my life that led to me being used/abused for longer periods of time which is something that I just started to acknowledge now. It's actually a realization of just last week: I would get the wrong friends, wrong relationships, etc, and then again push the bad feelings away and not break up those 'relationships' or **not put and end to really 'bad situations' because of that.**\n\nI want to be able to feel the sensation of my emotion. Observe it. Give myself some love. Watch it fade away, instead of judging myself for feeling the way I do in the first place or completely dismissing and repressing it. any advice?",

I was too scared to tell anyone. every time I was happy I would remember I had something wrong with me, and it scared me so much. It made me angry and sad constantly. I got pretty bad depression at around 16-17.

Im still depressed and confused about my mental state today. \n\nMy question is, after feeling so negative and depressed about this for so long, after each happy moment being tainted by the thought that there was no point being happy, could i have accidentally conditioned myself to be sad and to worry and to be anxious and to not want to think about the future? Could it be some sort of trauma after facing that negativity for 5 years?

I feel fairly uncertain a lot of the time and I feel that‚Äôs spawned commitment issues (maybe). I‚Äôm still happy alot of the time but whenever I remember something slightly stressful or ‚Äòwrong‚Äô in my life, I feel a deep sadness and anger, I feel the same emotion I felt when I would remember I had an ‚Äòissue‚Äô with my balls (minus the fear of death). I try to ground myself whenever I feel it.\n\nI‚Äôm really curious as to whether anyone knows ANYTHING about this or has any similar experiences, I can‚Äôt find much information and I don‚Äôt know what to type into Google.

    "selftext": "Hey all,\n\nI've been feeling quite depressed the last couple of days due to my lack of lf success with women. I am 28M and have never had a girlfriend. I've had a few hookups here and there but nothing that has really stuck. I am a good looking guy (have been told this multiple times) and have had a fair number of women interested in me over the years, however, I haven't been able to capitalise on any of these opportunities. \n\nNow how does this relate to trauma? \n\nWell my upbringing was quite traumatic as I have a mother who likes to control everything and everyone around her, to the point that it was extremely domineering. I wasn't able/allowed to speak up or express myself or express any kind of sexuality. She was also very hyper critical of me as a child. I also have a very passive father who just gives in to everything that my mum says. He doesn't have any boundaries and seems to lack a strong sense of self. In this sense I didn't have a good father or mother figure growing up. So I have been quite fucked up emotionally, never being able to trust people or authority, and struggling with social skills lot of the time. \n\nAll of this has led me to grow up to be a very shy and passive person, particularly around women. I am able to be masculine around my guy friends, but as soon as I am faced with a woman I act submissive and place them on a super high pedestal and try to please them and never feel worthy enough for them. I've already done a lot of emotional growth, facing a lot of my shit, but there's this one deep wound that is seemingly holding me back from having the dating life that I want. Right now it is a non-existent dating life. \n\nSo what I really want to know is:\n\n1. Can anyone relate to this story (I'm sure there's quite a few)?\n2. How can I overcome this deeply flawed relationship with women / heal this deep wound of mine so that I can finally have women in my life?\n\nI've tried dating apps, with zero success. Even paid to get some photos done specifically for this. I have tried going to bars/clubs/events. I have even tried meeting women during the day at the beach/shopping centre/etc. I've been on a few dates previously, but not for maybe 6 months now. It always comes back to this fundamental problem of acting out the patterns from childhood and acting like a little boy around women. Not being able to step into my manhood and be masculine. Tip toeing around women and not expressing myself or being honest with them. Trying to constantly win their approval and please them. \n\nI really don't know how to overcome this. I'll probably post this in other communities as well who can give  me some practical dating advice, but I do feel that there's a deep trauma that is playing out in my interactions with women day to day.

Would you be interested in sharing your experiences?**\n\nI am completing this research as part of my training as a Trainee Clinical Psychologist at Salomons Institute of Applied Psychology (Canterbury Christ Church University).‚ÄØ\n\nWe hope to learn more about the effect of the timing of childhood adversities on people‚Äôs later experiences of psychotic-like experiences, through their narratives. The purpose of this study is also to get a better understanding of factors that may be protective during adverse experiences and factors that contribute to managing these experiences.‚ÄØ‚ÄØ\n\nParticipants will be asked to talk about the past and difficult experiences, which can bring about distressing or intense emotions. Therefore, we ask you to consider if this would negatively impact on your wellbeing.\n\n**Who can participate?**  \n\\- Aged 18+  \n\\- English as a first language  \n\\- People who have faced adversity in childhood (before 18 years)  \n\\- Experienced voices, visions, unusual or unshared beliefs (sometimes referred to as ‚Äòpsychosis‚Äô or psychotic-like experiences) in adulthood\n\n*Childhood adversity could be, but not restricted to: experiencing/witnessing physical, sexual, emotional abuse, violence at home, war, natural disasters, poverty, family breakdown, crime, parental/carer/ sibling illness or death, bullying, moving country.*\n\n*Psychotic-like experiences could be, but not restricted to: Hearing voices that others do not, Seeing visions that others do not, Unusual beliefs, Confusing or rapidly changing thoughts, Disrupted or constant speech.*\n\n**What will I need to do?‚ÄØ(2 stages)**  \n\n1. Brief phone call:  \n\\- To establish eligibility for the study  \n\\- To get some more information\n2. Virtual Interview:  \n\\- 60-90 minute virtual interview where you will be ask to tell your life story  \n\\- You will be asked to share difficult experiences in childhood and psychotic-like experiences  \n\\- This will be audio recorded.\n\nThis study has been approved by the Salomons Ethics Panel (Salomons Institute for Applied Psychology, Canterbury Christ Church University) on 13th July 2023.‚ÄØ\n\nThank you very much for your interest.\n\nIf you would like to take part, message me or follow the link to sign up.

I will start with a story, ideas, and suggestions related to self-care before bringing the conversation around to inviting everyone to join in. I will offer questions to help you find your best personal self-care strategies, but you do NOT need to share anything deeply personal or triggering. **(No need to talk about trauma in this group. The focus is on self-care)**\n\nThe questions are mainly for topics like this:\n\n* What is a self-care goal of yours?\n* What does it feel like when you try to move toward that goal?\n* What do you think is stopping you from meeting that goal?\n* What is one step you think you can take toward that goal in the next week?\n\nWe will share and talk, and then we will wrap up, maybe offer one another a few virtual hugs, and return to our week inspired, calmed, and ready to take that next small step forward.\n\nFeel free to DM me with any questions or if you want to join but don't want to go through MeetUp. (I can just send you the Zoom link but don't want to post it here publicly.)\n\nAnd if you're interested but can't make this specific time, let me know as well.\n\nHugs,\n\n* Ariana",

I came from a big Catholic family and my mother made darned sure that I was shamed about my body the same way she was as a kid. According to her a girl's body was only for procreating, and thinking anything sexy was a sin. \n\n Some things I was told as a preteen/ teenager: \"Go put more clothes on. You're making your brothers uncomfortable.\" \"Why are you wearing makeup? You look like a sl-t.\" \"Don't put your feminine products under the sink in your bathroom. Your brothers have to share it with you and it makes them uncomfortable.\" \"You're not allowed to use tampons because it might make you have ideas.\" \"Everyone at the family gathering noticed that you've put on weight.\" \"Nope, you can't buy any other underwear than white. Colored underwear gives you ideas. If you feel sexy then you're going to act sexy, and you're to be pure and virginal till the day you get married.\" \"Are you sure you want to eat that? How are you going to catch a husband if you're overweight?\" \"If you wear that guys will think you're a sl-t.\" \n\nAnd then....as a teenager determined to diet and starve myself into the ideal so that people would leave me alone. \"Wow, everyone says you look great! Good job slimming down. \"\n\nSo, I grew up being extremely self conscious and really hating my body at certain times.  As a teenager I threw away most pictures of myself because I thought I looked \"fat\". I've worked really hard with years of therapy to make peace with the way I was raised and feel ok in my own skin. \n\nAnyways, I have two daughters (16 and 8) who are quite comfortable in their own skin and it's the way I wish I was treated as a kid. \n\nHowever, I still find myself having to hold my tongue once in a while to not sound like my mother. \n\nMy 16 year old is enjoying her teenage years in a way that I was never allowed to.  And yeah it does make me envious but I'm working on it. \n\nOne day at a time. \n\n&#x200B;",

Don‚Äôt be a sheep, allow yourself to be a unique, beautifully imperfect human‚Ä¶life has no set schedule or manual, so stop comparing yourself to others. Don‚Äôt be afraid to be different or go against the societal/social norm. Learn to be okay with being controversial, and unlearn society‚Äôs unrealistic standards. You‚Äôre uniquely you.

It‚Äôs time to stop fearing other people, they‚Äôre only human, just like you, with their own flaws and challenges and personal hells to go through. If something doesn‚Äôt affect you, just shut up about it and don‚Äôt butt into other people‚Äôs business. It‚Äôs not your life, it‚Äôs theirs, and you‚Äôre not them.

    "selftext": "\n\nOn New Year's Eve, coincidentally my father's birthday, things were going well until he became intoxicated, using profanity and behaving recklessly. Despite decades of discussions about his drinking problem, it persists. While he has improved over his lifetime. When he drinks alcohol it changes who he is, and being almost 20 weeks pregnant makes me hesitant about bringing a child into a world where my father acts like a child himself. Contemplating distancing myself further and minimizing contact throughout the year, unlike my understanding brother, I struggle to accept his behavior due to past traumas. Recognizing this avoidance pattern, I'm seeking advice on enhancing my well-being in this challenging situation.\n\nNote: Even if I address my father about his poor behavior, he's unlikely to change; he's set in his ways. Observing my brother's understanding and forgiveness, despite enduring childhood trauma caused by our father, highlights a contrast. And making me wonder if I‚Äôm handling things wrong, which in turn is making me question myself as a mother-to-be. While I thought I had moved past those issues, my fathers behavior still triggers and upsets me. It might be more of a personal challenge for me than a problem with him.\n\nOn New Year's Day, I approached him to address my discomfort with what happened, intending to take a step back with how often I visit. I felt the need to voice my concerns openly. However, it didn't go as planned. \n\nThe interaction unfolded like this: as I walked down the stairs, he remained silent. Time passed, my husband appeared, and he asked him how he was doing. Later, to start the conversation, I pointed out that he hadn't asked me how I was doing. He responded with profuse apologies without really answering my question, to which I said I didn't need apologies but tried to proceed with discussing his behavior from the previous night. He defensively claimed he did nothing wrong and stormed off before I could finish my thoughts. \n\nNow my husband is telling me I was too upset/petty and I shouldn‚Äôt have started the conversation by saying ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not going to ask me how I am‚Äù. And if I‚Äôm honest I‚Äôve told him all about all my childhood traumas but he doesn‚Äôt understand it, so it‚Äôs a really lonely feeling right now. \n\nI feel like I‚Äôm truly alone. And I need to figure this out my self and I have no support. Either they tell me I‚Äôm too upset (even though I‚Äôm speaking calmly/not swearing), too angry, too opinionated. Im constantly hearing excuses for my father‚Äôs bad behaviour. \n\nAt this point I‚Äôm not going back to my parents while he‚Äôs there. Seeking perspectives or thoughts.",

I was fifteen years old at the  time, and as much as I am trying to heal, it still impacts me; although  I've made progress, this time of year has been a bit hard ever since I  began to come to terms with what happened. With what they did to me -  they were so much older than me.\n\nI  have, at various points in my healing journey, struggled with  retraumatization. With wanting to be used and hurt again, with wanting  to be abused again, with wanting to be given over to harmful, hurtful  people - predatory people - and be used again. Although I've had some  success in combating some of this - I feel like some of my biggest  successes this year have been learning to internalize that I'm not just a  piece of meat, or a toy, but I was used, and I don't have to be used  again; that I have agency and can choose those things that make me  comfortable and are for my healing - I've been struggling with it a lot  lately, to the point where I am overwhelmed by thoughts of being in the  company of the types of people that hurt me again, of being talked dirty  to, of being used; but as soon as I'm in those spaces again, I shut  down. I start shaking and trembling, I go rigid - I know much of the  'why,' with regards to why I do this - or at least I'm beginning to -  but I get tired of the wanting to go back. It's like once I've backed  out, I'm consumed again with the thoughts of being hurt again. I get so,  so tired, and this feels like the one area where I haven't gotten  better at all.\n\nAnd so I come to  2024, feeling tired, defeated, and - although having made some progress,  per my counselors, don't feel as if I have much to show for anything. I  am trying to grow into a kinder, more loving person - not only the kind  person I used to be, but the kind of kind person I long to be - and it  feels like my heart is just filled with bilge and filth, and I have to  keep pumping and dredging through this muck - and I'm just tired of  myself and disgusted with myself. I feel like a fake and a fraud; so  much that is good is happening in my life, but I feel so much fear  because of the fact that I still struggle with this pain, and this  trauma - I feel so afraid that I'll never be over this, and that I'll  never be able to be well. That I'll wind up, in one way or another,  perpetuating abuse - not necessarily in the same way as what I went  through (I identify as asexual), but this sense of being tainted feels  all pervasive; that since I've been abused and traumatized in this way,  I'll never be free. I am trying to break free from this stagnation, and I  do not wish to be in a cycle of victimhood and helplessness... I know  how much rides on my healing. I want to be well for my friends. But I  feel as if there's so little to hope for.\n\nHas anyone else come to a 'dead end' feeling, so to speak? Does anyone have any advice?",

    "title": "Dealing depression and feer after stabbing accident",
    "selftext": "I've tried therapy and nothing seems to be working. In August this year I was cooking with my roommate when I was cleaning a chef knife. My roommate had put a hot  pan in the sink without telling me and I reached unknowing and burnt myself. I jumped back with the knife and stabbed myself about several inches deep in the lower abdomin. I passed out almost immediately and my roommate called 911. After several minutes I had a seizure which woke me up. When I got to the hospital I was told I needed an emergency exploratory laparotomy due to how deep the knife went (piercing into where my organs could potentially be). I woke in the hospital in inconceivable pain, like I was screaming whenever I was moved. I had no idea where I was and was alone for maybe 30 minutes before I was taken into a hospital bed. I was in the hospital for 6 days after that. It took me 3 days to be able to make it to the door of my hospital room without help. I had a complication with my intestines that left me vomitting, violently, non stop for all 6 days. I had a hematoma that slowed down the healing of my surgical wounds as blood constantly was draining from it. I couldn't use the bathroom on my own, I felt humiliated having another person have to help me clean myself, wipe my own vomit off my gown. I felt like filth. I was in constant pain. On day 4 I believe, I had am acute diatonic reaction from compazine that left me unable to control any of my muscles (raising arms in the air uncontrollable shaking) for a few hours why the doctors called a code and panicked. Scary morning of my life. I legitimately for the second time in a week didn't know if I would be ok. I was so scared. I hated myself. I wish I had died. I legitimately thought I was living hell on earth. Fuck it still hurts to sneeze sometimes. I couldn't sleep for weeks.\n\nEver since this my depression which, really was not that before, has become completely unmanageble. I hate my existence. I'm insecure of every facet of myself. I'm constantly angry, most of the time at nothing. I have these horrendous thoughts sometimes that invade my thoughts of my next terrible accident. For example the other day at work I was carrying a long thin metal spoon and the thought of tripping and piercing my neck accidentally, and choking out on my own blood wouldn't leave my head. I straight up just had to leave the kitchen area. Whenever I see knives or hold anything sharp, I like cringe, it's incredibly difficult for me. I think back to the hospital stay, and I can't every go through that again\n\nAnd it's like im painfully aware now of my own mortality, and the confines of my own existence. How meaningless my life is. How I could one day suddenly die, and my last seconds alive would be alone, and every facet of my life, would mean nothing. I could die alone and instantaneously. My happiness isn't permanent, and will end. The thought of death scares me, but so does the thought of living. I'm just fucking scared. Its like the idea of growing old scares me. The constant flowing of time bothers me. It feels like every second is a memory away. I don't feel like I can talk to anyone in my life about this. It makes me feel weak and needy. Like I don't want them to think I want attention. I don't know how to handle these thoughts. I've been so depressed at points that I've struggled significantly with suicidal ideation. I want to be heard, but I don't know how to speak. \n\nI don't know if any of this makes sense. I feel trapped, scared and helpless. I need help. But I don't know what to do or who to go to. I've tried therapy and it just isn't working.",

After tonight, I‚Äôm at this friend‚Äôs house for 3 more nights and then I head back to my place for school about 2 hours away. \n\nAs I‚Äôm laying here, though, the thought occurs to me that this is the start of me going low-contact with my parents. This part is a little tricky because I‚Äôm still slightly dependent on them (I think just car insurance, copays, and my phone plan). Aside from that, though, going low contact means that I likely won‚Äôt be back in my hometown anytime soon. It means that I‚Äôd also be at limited contact with my community, especially the people who are very close to my parents.

I haven't been diagnosed with anything. I wouldn't be surprised if there is depression.

A few close people recon my mum is a narcissist but theres no actual diagnosis and I think she is at times borderline abusive but in an emotional/verbal way and my dad was low level physically abusive.

I still stay at my parents‚Äô house for breaks and holidays, and I‚Äôve become a master compartmentalizer. I try to forget about the trauma my parents put me through and do my best to just enjoy family time, which I often do for the most part.\n\nI‚Äôm doing more trauma work in therapy, though, and being home was starting to feel retraumatizing. When I go to my parents‚Äô house now, I remember everything. I was still trying to compartmentalize for Christmas, but on Tuesday, my mom made a comment that made it impossible to keep doing that.\n\nSo I started looking for ways out of my parents‚Äô house. I originally told my parents that I‚Äôd be at their house until January 3rd. I have a coffee date on the third and then I‚Äôd head back to my law school apartment. But also. I needed to get away from my parents‚Äô house before then.\n\nI have an amazing friend that has offered multiple times in the past to let me crash at her place if being at my parents‚Äô house ever felt like too much. So I took her up on the offer. The only problem was what to tell my parents about why I was suddenly leaving early.\n\nMy coffee date is with someone I haven‚Äôt seen in forever and the 3rd was the only date that worked so I really did not want to cancel. And there was no way I was explaining to my parents why I was leaving to stay at a friend‚Äôs house in the same city.\n\nSo I lied. I told my parents that I was heading back to my law school apartment in order to study ahead of classes starting. We had a conversation about how classes come first. And I felt awful. I hate lying so much. I know that it was the best option. Staying in my parents‚Äô house didn‚Äôt feel safe and the other option was to cancel my coffee date and actually head back to my law school apartment early, where the town is empty right now.

I dunno.\n\nMum should‚Äôve KNOWN i was desperate to leave my old school when i did an action repeat and gave her my vent art, hoping it‚Äôd convince her to take me out like she did before.\n\nIt didn‚Äôt and i got traumatized worse, i just want to leave education all together, curl up ajd just cry sometimes due to the feelings.\n\nI‚Äôm done with education! I just want out due to whats happened I NEED TO STAY  UNTIL I‚ÄôM 25 I THINK!!\n\ni get it but still!. I‚Äôm scared to go back to college. It‚Äôs mentally tiring having to force myself to work. I‚Äôm trying. Not hard enough according to my mother.\n\nI keep having to fight off trauma responses and i need to keep an eye on myself. Cause apparently after i get somethijg i want, i become rude! I never notice it happening until it‚Äôs too late! I hate it!! No wonder mum called me spoiled!\n\nSo i need to keep trauma down, try not to go bitch mode, try not to traumatize anyone further. And be kind to All.\n\nI mask in school apparently.\n\nI dunno what my true self is anymore. Mum says ‚Äúkind, bright‚Äù but also ‚Äúspoiled cow, distugusting‚Äù when i misbehave. All schools say ‚Äúkind, strong, bright‚Äù\n\nI don‚Äôt know myself anymore. Just a person with a name who feels like a husk of herself and a few people in her head who try to help (sorry i got more out of it by now- ugh feels like i‚Äôm making this all up for attention i‚Äôm sorry)\n\nIt‚Äôs just weird. Never felt.. right. Wished to not be autistic. But i am. I‚Äôll‚Ä¶ i dunno i‚Äôm sorry i‚Äôll end this off\n\nThanks for reading. I needed to get this off my chest. Please give advice. Thank you.",

I have been used, cheated on and told I was a ‚Äúworthless virgin and that I was just a stepping stone for their next relationship‚Äù. So I have ALOT of issues with maintaining relationships, whether friendships or dating.\nRecently, the restaurant I have been working at for 3 years promoted me to management. It was hard work but I am making something of myself. Anyway, there is a server (25/F) that I have been friendly with since being promoted. We hung out about a week ago at the local bar, and after quite a few drinks, she started telling me about her life and the things she has been through and it was like staring in a mirror. We talked from about 11:30pm-3:00am and it was the most comfortable I have ever been around anyone in my life. We went to her house and smoked a blunt, listened to music and talked. \nNow here is where the issue started: after I left for the night, a week ago, I find myself thinking about her ALOT. And honestly, I like her. My issue is I don‚Äôt want to fuck up a friendship, I like spending time with her and just talking about life and hobbies. But, I honestly do have feelings for her I just can‚Äôt bring myself to tell her. And that hurts more than anything else in my life.\nMy question is: does this sound like my trauma or could this be actually something real?\nI‚Äôm going to talk to her after work tomorrow, please give me some honest feedback before then if you don‚Äôt mind.

He would hit me a lot and he would throw things at me but honestly the worst things he ever did was what he would say to me. \n\nI would spend the night in his apartment and he would literally not say a word to me sometimes and other times he would either go out his way to just tear me down and insult me or my family, he told me that if I ever told anyone about what he did to me then he would kill me and then hurt my mum so I just let him abuse me out of fear for my families life.

We‚Äôll spend over 50% of our time on **guided meditations**  to help us process that which is unresolved and move, in a natural,  unforced way, towards forgiveness, release, and integration. During the exercises, we‚Äôll focus on both processing and forgiving  others and ourselves. We‚Äôll develop and deepen compassion towards self  and other (to the extent we can). Importantly, we‚Äôll give ourselves full  permission to feel our suffering, validating any difficult emotions.  We‚Äôll also engage in perspective taking exercises which will help us  release ourselves from blame and release others from blame when we are  ready to do so ‚Äì never rushing the process! We‚Äôll also review insights  and see how they will lighten the load going forward. We‚Äôll draw from: 1 Coherence Therapy 2 Ideal Parent Figure Protocol 3 Metacognitive Interpersonal Therapy 4 Dan Brown‚Äôs work on Forgiveness\n\nCost: this course is available on a sliding scale basis.

    "selftext": "So last night I had smoked a bunch with my friend (odd way to start, my badüò≠) and on the way home in the Uber I was just sitting and thinking and I kind of suddenly remembered some things that happened when I was much younger, like under 10. I won't go into detail but its some instances of what seems like cocsa. This is not the first time I've remembered this, I'm aware that I've known about it and thought about it in the past, but it hit me that I hadn't thought about this in YEARS (I'm 21 now) and that seems pretty odd for something like that. I also realized I can realized I can remember the surrounding details like right before and right after, but I can't remember the critical moments of what happened. This is the first time I thought about how this could have actually affected me long term. I've never thought I was someone who has trauma although I have a few mental health conditions (depression, anxiety, ED, + being neurodivergent). So yeah, I'm not really sure what else to say, but I'm just looking for advice. I'm doing fine mental at the moment and I haven't felt any huge emotional stress since remembering this. What should I do?",

It has been almost 25 years so maybe I am still immature or acting like victim or w/e. \n\nI was born in an Asian country and it happened when I was 9 or so. There was a shortcut between my school and the village where I lived. At that time, almost every kid walked to school and back home without parents or guardians. \n\nA water stream was between the school and the village, and it was a lot of walk to get to the bridge. So kids usually used stepping stones to cross the stream. I crossed the stream and there was my friend and a boy I've never seen, wearing a middle school uniform nearby. He suggested to show us the shortcut. We followed him through the little wood area. And a white small puppy showed up, was barking at us, shaking its tail and looked happy when we pat him. \n\nAnd that middle school boy said, \"should we throw him away? It looks fun. I've never done it.\" My friend and I said no. He was really cute and innocent puppy. He was a baby puppy. The boy then grabbed the puppy, counted down to 5, and threw the puppy like a baseball pitching to the ground. \n\nThe puppy started screaming, went back to where it came from like limp. \n\nThe boy said, \"I knew it, it is still alive. No worries. Let's go.\"\n\nIt hurt me so bad. I still remember it. I thought I never had any traumas in my life but I found out that is mine.

    "selftext": "hoping for advice about recovering memories. During the summer between my freshman and junior years in high school I met a friend who turned out to be an enemy. We were both 14f, she had a permissive mom and a cool boyfriend with a car. My mother was essentially non existent for any of this. \n\nThis girl (I‚Äôll call her Angela) befriended me sort of out of nowhere. I don‚Äôt remember many things, and how we actually met is one of them. But we became besties. She took me to the mall and pressured me to steal a dress from nordstroms - something I‚Äôd never done. Then she took me to some parties. I remember parts of those parties - she and I were the only girls, the males ranged from 21-28. I would inevitably get drunk and the rest of the night would be blank. At one point Angela took me to a party at  friend of her boyfriends. They left and then I was there with him for a week and I don‚Äôt remember most of it. The parts I do remember involve him drinking a lot and what I now recognize as various types of SA. He told me a lot of sad stories about his life and claimed to be a 28 year old former Alaska state trooper which now all sounds fake. \n\nWhat I‚Äôm really wondering about is how to get these memories back, and to know what really happened to me. I recently asked my mother & older sister about this by saying ‚Äòhey you guys remember this stuff that happened? Well I think I was sex trafficked maybe?‚Äô And they both said ‚Äòum, yeah!‚Äô Like I‚Äôm a idiot for even wondering but then they wouldn‚Äôt elaborate or say anything further. We are mostly estranged. \n\nI‚Äôve been constantly thinking about this for months with no answered and no one to ask really.

    "selftext": "hello everyone. i hope that you all are doing okay. :)\n\ni'm in a difficult situation with a friend of mine who i will call flowers. flowers is one of my close acquaintances, if not the closest. we met last year when our college paired us as roommates last year, and we are still close. we have a lot of things in common, but most important for this post, we both have traumatic backgrounds.\n\nfor whatever reason, my brain will not let this go. i am always thinking about it, if only subconsciously. it's such an awful thing to be fixated on but i *cannot stop*. it feels as though everything i've been through she has gone through but one thousand times worse. if my mental health is bad, hers is abyssmal. all of my abuse seems like child's play in regards to hers. and as awful as it sounds, hearing her talk about her issues and situations makes me want to tear out my heart.\n\nwhen she talks about her trauma it makes me want to make mine worse so that i'm valid enough to call myself traumatised. it makes me want to put myself back into situations that i know will hurt me, go back to people i know are bad, do things i know will jeopardise my sanity. i want to get worse. i hate it so much, but i want to be worse than her. i want to be worse off. i don't know why. i hate it and it makes me uncomfortable. for the record, i DO NOT hate flowers. i think she is a wonderful person and i look up to her very much. i want her to be okay and safe. but she triggers me? i guess?? i don't know.\n\ni cannot talk to anyone i know in real life about this. it's currently finals and the end of the semester, and so everyone is stressed. i'm currently my social circle's go to person for a few people to vent to, and i cannot break down without making them uncomfortable. in regards to flowers, i've stayed up into the early mornings sitting with her whilst she breaks down (with her permission) so that i can make sure she stays safe and grounded and doesn't hurt herself or spiral more.\n\ntw for suicide >!i know that i am the reason she has tried to hurt herself before as i cook often and keep knives in my dorm -- we're in the same dorm and i've had to take knives out of her hands before she's stabbed herself. !<so not only do i feel guilty for wanting to worsen my own mental health, but i also have to contend with knowing that i am the reason hers is worsening. and, as selfish as it is, this makes me feel worse. it's an awful, never ending cycle.\n\nhas anyone else here ever been in a similar situation? if so, any advice is appreciated. i'd also like to know if this makes me a bad person. and if so, how to make myself better. i just want this to stop. it's scary and makes me want to throw up or curl up into a ball and cry. i don't know how to make it better and it bothers me so much. sorry for rambling. thanks for any advice or whatnot <3",

    "selftext": "   Early to mid 30s here and lately I‚Äôve been feeling insanely depressed. I have a lot of trauma stemming from childhood and early adulthood in which I have no one to discuss. I don‚Äôt exactly have access to mental health help at the moment and really I just want advice on how to be happier and make it through. \n  \n   I recognize a lot of my issues and I‚Äôm at the point where I can pretty much control my panic attacks. A lot of times I feel incredibly lonely even amongst people and my partner. Mental health has lately been causing me to question my entire life and relationship, I feel like I have no direction or motivation. So any advice on giving myself direction and motivation would also be appreciated. Sorry for rambling, but thanks in advance for any advice.",

    "selftext": "Apologies for the trauma dump, I don't have any where to go and this is my first time posting (sorry if i break any rules or it just kinda is lengthy)   \nEverything changed a week ago..Laughing and making jokes, stressed but okay, till the phone rang. I answered it so confidently. Didn‚Äôt even think twice‚Ä¶Heard the doctors voice break the news though and everything slowed down‚Ä¶i felt my chest sink..and my world start spinning‚Ä¶ you would have thought i just witnessed a murder but the sudden drop in my tone. I walked to the office‚Ä¶I called my Co worker back..and broke‚Ä¶and told him everything. Now still a week later I dont know how to process these emotions or even what is left of life but i know I‚Äôm done. I started mourning the loss of my life for my family and friends and they don‚Äôt even know that yet. A few years back during quarantine i met this boy, cute, charming, funny. The first time we hung out we drove around for hours under the stars getting to know each other. Both two awkward people being able to talk for hours, laughing, smiling, sharing music, sharing our trauma and what has made us who we were then. Now just a shell left of who i use to be.  But I didn‚Äôt wanna leave but we did we ended that night with a simple hug and went our separate ways and continued to message back and forth till we saw each other next, and again, another night of non stop bantering and laughing..in the next week or so he got kicked out for where he was living, told me this whole long story that played him the victim, maybe he was. I couldnt say. But i liked this guy, and i was doing well off financially because of the unemployment payout for covid. For some reason i felt it was my obligation to help this guy i just met. So i helped put him in hotel rooms, find a new place to live, help him set up his resume to find a job and everything i could. I payed for his rent even‚Ä¶what the hell was i thinking‚Ä¶soon enough fights broke out. He always blamed it on him being stressed out and all alone. With no family left. From his cracked out mom offering to suck him off for drug money, to his deadbeat dad, or the uncle he killed after years of some of the most traumatic abuse anyone could think of and i could relate from all the time my  previous ex had put his hand around my throat. I felt for this kid. But i could hardly understand the fights that we were having though, Both of us so strong willed and hot headed. They always felt out of the blue. Like it depended which way the wind was blowing on if he was mad, sad, or happy that day and if it was my fault. He‚Äôd cry and get mad when he looked in the mirror, reminding himself of his uncle. If his clothes felt to tight or didnt fit just right, if his teeth were aching, because his uncle use to pull them out with pliers, if he was even slightly mad hed throw his phone till it broke‚Ä¶and then get more mad because now he doesn‚Äôt have a phone he so desperately needed and/or he would shred his clothes to pieces and then complain about having nothing left‚Ä¶. I spent so many morning fighting with him, begging, pleading to him to go to the each one of his jobs he would get only for him to say that it was too hard , too much anxiety and that he couldn,t and then be fired immediately‚Ä¶ Or if he did go for a few weeks he would find a reason to hate the place or the people and quit on the spot if not getting fired for anger issues‚Ä¶I was exhausted and i spent so much time fighting with him. I just didn‚Äôt know he was bipolar lschitzphrenic till it was too late and i had moved out with him..to try and help him get on his feet before all of this had gotten to this point‚Ä¶it all just happened so fast. But the fights were getting way to intense and draining on me and i ended up leaving my volunteer work on a suicide hotline‚Ä¶so ironic with where i am at now‚Ä¶but he broke every door in this apartment. One time during one of the fights when i was really scared he broke right through that door. I think one of the worst fights, i coudnt even tell you what it was about, was when i was trying to leave‚Ä¶which i always did when we fought, not healthy i know‚Ä¶but its not like i ever got out anyways. I would run from door to door to try and leave and he would yank me from them. As soon as i could unlock the door he would be there, with his long fast legs and weirdly strong arms, even as a gym rat i was never able to overpower this man.. No matter how hard i try‚Ä¶if i ever came close he would black mail me and say he will call the cops and get me arrested‚Ä¶but anyways at some point he got me in choke hold..i tried to fight but i was losing blood from my brain so quickly, everything began to fade. It didnt hurt but felt like the lights were getting dimmed, i wish he just finished the job then. As i wasa losing consciousness i peed myself in the middle of the bedroom floor‚Ä¶Once i was awake again, i just begged to go shower so i could get away‚Ä¶i cried‚Ä¶alot‚Ä¶but as slightlently as i could as i learned my ex to never cry ( he would come in and yell at me if i ever did) but i got out the shower and as soon as i opened the door with just a towel around me i ran for the door again‚Ä¶.this time i was so close..i lost the towel but the door was open. I could see the hall way, the exit.. I was so close before i tore me away and slammed my head into the wall behind..It didn‚Äôt feel like he was doing it to be mean, but like he couldnt stand losing me or letting me go‚Ä¶i was so controlled‚Ä¶months of this‚Ä¶at somepoint i stopped fighting, but he could tell i was scared and that pissed him off, making him feel like his uncle‚Ä¶we got into so many fights over this. Neirghbors called the cops a few times‚Ä¶but nothing ever stopped. I just grew accustomed. Part of me thinks that this felt like home. Watching the way my parents fought all those years, pots and pans being thrown, occasionally things would get violent but i could only hear the stomping and crying out as i was just 7 years old hiding in my closet alone. Theyd fight about the pictures my farther would take of the naked women in our basement. His ‚Äúmodels‚Äù these young women that would take over his life and their marriage. I believed women were just meant to be used for sex from an early age‚Ä¶maybe i got that after i was molested in by the 16yo neighborhood boy in the shed in my backyard. My om even walked in on us in their alone and‚Ä¶maybe she was in denial‚Ä¶but she didn‚Äôt do anything about it‚Ä¶i didnt know what was going on in that moment but i knew something was wrong‚Ä¶back to this current guy though, all the nights i refused to have sex with him came as a personal attack on him, me being stressed from managing all of our bills wasnt a good enough excuse for me to not want to open my legs to him. So‚Ä¶if i said no it would be  huge fight..and at first i did that.. For a really long time. And at somepoint i gave up‚Ä¶so maybe it is my fault that all this has happened‚Ä¶but i just did‚Äôt know what to do. But i would let him have his way. Sometimes i would cry during it‚Ä¶sometimes i was just waking up..but at the end of the day i let it happen‚Ä¶i couldnt bare telling my mom though. She already helped me get out of my last relationship..how could i let this cycle repeat? My friend helped me kick this guy out once but somehow he sneaked his way back into my home like a parasite i couldnt get rid of. Little did i know while he was gone he was sleeping with someone else‚Ä¶I let him back into my home while i was living away training for a new job and once i got home‚Ä¶he wouldnt leave, i didnt have the heart to just kick him out‚Ä¶i just kept imagining watching him walk out my apartment with the clothes on his back and no where to go‚Ä¶i regret this so much. Just typing this i feel sick knowing what i know now. So i let him stay a bit longer‚Ä¶ even if i was geting raped if not nightly then weekly‚Ä¶.atleast i knew it would end‚Ä¶it was going to end. That this was not going to be my life for ever. It. would. End. I Had so much hope..for a husband for a family, maybe a career as a personal trainer as working out is what got me through all my hard times. I wanted to help someone else get through theirs by increasing their physical and mental well being. Those were the only things that i wanted‚Ä¶but he took all of them‚Ä¶I finally got him out of my apartment and three months later a girl messages me..asking about him and if she should be scared. I told her it was for them to work out but i woudlnt keep him around if i was her‚Ä¶she shared that she went through similar fights with him and being raped‚Ä¶.but that she had herpes and that their relationship was basically on and off over the years that i had known him..i immediately was shocked and scared. He only just now was freaking out to her about it. Sounded like maybe he has an outbreak. But i never heard this from him, only her. So i went to the doctor,, explained everything, got tested for everything but unless your breaking out there is no way of knowing and everything came back negative, i think for my own mental well being i let all this go. Thought no way, this would be impossible. He didnt have any issues while we were together. And had his first issues months after we had separated‚Ä¶so upset and scared..but i let it go. Lived life like normal for the next five months. Found a man, a real man, that treated me nothing like i had ever been treated before, and considering maybe that wouldnt take much, but in the months that we have been together he was always treated me so so so dam well. Never once raised his voice at me or hand in the slightest. I finally started being able to sleep next to him‚Ä¶like sleep good‚Ä¶not something i could do with my ex. My ex would kick my cat into the wall if she even set foot on to the bed in the middle of the night so i was always on edge around him. But a few weeks ago after me and my current bf were finished doing the dirty i went to clean up in the bathroom and noticed a few small cuts, no blisters, nothing to weird, maybe in grown hairs got pulled? I didn‚Äôt know but i felt off about this. Next morning over i immediately called the dr.s and they couldnt get me in right away but i was frantic and scared so i kept pestering them‚Ä¶and when it was finally time for my appointment they couldnt even find it really..but i pointed, they saw the cuts but reassured me that it looked like nothing but again,...maybe some chaffing from beginning to go running again to some in grown hairs‚Ä¶but swabbed just in case‚Ä¶well‚Ä¶ a week later they called. I should have known right away when it was the doctor herself and not the nurse‚Ä¶but it came back positive for herpes‚Ä¶so that entire time i was taking care of him. I was housing him, feeding him, clothing him. I even would come home from 10 hr shifts to be his therapist for the rough day he had from being at home all day , cause again, couldnt get him to go get a job for the life of me no matter how much i pleaded for help with the bills. Nor could i complain about work without him telling me to be grateful i had a job‚Ä¶but after all that. The time , the money, my well being that i gave up so he could be sheltered‚Ä¶because the shelters were to dirty for him‚Ä¶that this is what i get in return‚Ä¶I told my current bf about all this, he didnt know much about my prev relationship but i messaged him a paper with the run down of it and explained the news i got from the doc. I was so scared he would hurt me if i did it in person, but even then he didnt get mad he just got down here as quick as he could to hold me as i cried‚Ä¶i havent stopped crying sense i found out either, its been a week. I stopped eating. I stopped exercising. I cant even listen to music. Everything that gives me any pleasure makes me feel to quilty. I havent faced my mom and she has been messaging me trying to check in but she doesnt know and i dont plan on letting her. She will worry and i dont want that for her, even she should be worried. I plan on leaving this planet soon and i feel so bad for my bf, i hope he is still clean and i didnt do it to him. I hope my mom will be okay and that my best friend will be too. But there is nothing left in this world for me anymore. I use to pride myself on all that i had been through and still being successful and having all these hobbies, from pole dancing, jiu jitsu, heavy lifter, I was even going to get my motorcycle lisense soon, scares the hell out of my mom but i was living such a happy filling life even for someone that didnt attend college. ( something i always felt ashamed for, ive always cared more about what others think then i should) so something like this, when i have this constant urge for perfection‚Ä¶.something like this that i cant cure‚Ä¶i cant handle anymore. After how many times i have been raped and felt irrationally dirty for it now to be my reality. To be dirty and gross‚Ä¶.I cant show up to the places that people know me, a regular in my gym for years. I cant go back, i cant have a family, or a husband now, my health will be destroyed with this, something i have worked years on. I shake now when i go in public, im so scared to be looked at, or when a guy looks my way and thinks im attractive, i feel guilty for it and so much shame.. All because i thought i was doing was right by putting this guy who had no one above myself‚Ä¶only for it to now kill me. I am disgusting.. I feel so bad for my mom, my bf who says he wont leave‚Ä¶but he will..i know he will‚Ä¶im just a shell of what i was once. I dont feel like the same person. Everything i wanted has been ripped away from me. I always thought i wanted to live in the same town for ever, watch my parents grow old and help take care of them, start my own family one day and raise them here. But now i just think about taking off and backpacking across the US..it isn‚Äôt me‚Ä¶but i dont wanna be known anymore, i dont want people to know my name, or my face or ever have the chance to come across me. I dont think this is a realistic thing that i can do as a shy introvert with minimal savings‚Ä¶but it just shows me how much i dont think i am the same anymore, The gym doesnt matter as my health will probably be destroyed by this. I cant meet anyone anymore because i will be feeling like i am hiding this huge secret and living a lie. No one will want to stay around me anymore. I barely can go a few hours with out crying, i dont eat anymore, i cant. and anytime i am not working i take half a bottle off zzquil to keep myself knocked out. This is the end of me and my long terrible short life of 25 years. I hope my mom will be okay..she has my sister still. I hope this doesnt hurt my sister too much, I feel selfish leaving my bf , a great man, behind but i also feel guilty staying , like i trapped him with this. I just hope he isnt contaminated and by me leaving will only leave him safer. And for my best friend‚Ä¶your so strong. You will be okay‚Ä¶or maybe ill see you on the other side. \r  \n\r  \n\r  \nIts been months now sense i wrote this‚Ä¶about 5 and although it has gotten easier to get out of bed‚Ä¶i still struggle to find any meaning too. I‚Äôve let my body go. Ive let my mental go‚Ä¶And i dont think i have ever missed someone quite like i miss my old self. I loved her and i was so happy and blessed to be her and now i have never been more miserable for so long. ",

I plan on leaving this planet soon and i feel so bad for my bf, i hope he is still clean and i didnt do it to him. I hope my mom will be okay and that my best friend will be too. But there is nothing left in this world for me anymore. I use to pride myself on all that i had been through and still being successful and having all these hobbies, from pole dancing, jiu jitsu, heavy lifter, I was even going to get my motorcycle lisense soon, scares the hell out of my mom but i was living such a happy filling life even for someone that didnt attend college. ( something i always felt ashamed for, ive always cared more about what others think then i should) so something like this, when i have this constant urge for perfection‚Ä¶.something like this that i cant cure‚Ä¶i cant handle anymore. After how many times i have been raped and felt irrationally dirty for it now to be my reality. To be dirty and gross‚Ä¶.I cant show up to the places that people know me, a regular in my gym for years. I cant go back, i cant have a family, or a husband now, my health will be destroyed with this, something i have worked years on. I shake now when i go in public, im so scared to be looked at, or when a guy looks my way and thinks im attractive, i feel guilty for it and so much shame.. All because i thought i was doing was right by putting this guy who had no one above myself‚Ä¶only for it to now kill me. I am disgusting.. I feel so bad for my mom, my bf who says he wont leave‚Ä¶but he will..i know he will‚Ä¶im just a shell of what i was once. I dont feel like the same person. Everything i wanted has been ripped away from me. I always thought i wanted to live in the same town for ever, watch my parents grow old and help take care of them, start my own family one day and raise them here. But now i just think about taking off and backpacking across the US..it isn‚Äôt me‚Ä¶but i dont wanna be known anymore, i dont want people to know my name, or my face or ever have the chance to come across me. I dont think this is a realistic thing that i can do as a shy introvert with minimal savings‚Ä¶but it just shows me how much i dont think i am the same anymore, The gym doesnt matter as my health will probably be destroyed by this. I cant meet anyone anymore because i will be feeling like i am hiding this huge secret and living a lie. No one will want to stay around me anymore. I barely can go a few hours with out crying, i dont eat anymore, i cant. and anytime i am not working i take half a bottle off zzquil to keep myself knocked out. This is the end of me and my long terrible short life of 25 years. I hope my mom will be okay..she has my sister still. I hope this doesnt hurt my sister too much, I feel selfish leaving my bf , a great man, behind but i also feel guilty staying , like i trapped him with this. I just hope he isnt contaminated and by me leaving will only leave him safer. And for my best friend‚Ä¶your so strong. You will be okay‚Ä¶or maybe ill see you on the other side. \r  \n\r  \n\r  \nIts been months now sense i wrote this‚Ä¶about 5 and although it has gotten easier to get out of bed‚Ä¶i still struggle to find any meaning too. I‚Äôve let my body go. Ive let my mental go‚Ä¶And i dont think i have ever missed someone quite like i miss my old self. I loved her and i was so happy and blessed to be her and now i have never been more miserable for so long. ",

    "selftext": " \n\nI've  struggled in romantic relationships - well, in one romantic  relationship, I've only ever been in the one. I'm looking for advice -  or at least, for someone to hear me out. I'm sure mine is not the only  relationship that was like this, but.. I'm just scared. Scared of  perpetuating the harm I went through.\n\nI  dated someone for three years. A very lovely and kind person, and a  more intentional one you'd never meet. It was one year into this  relationship that I realized what happened to me‚Äî that I'd been groomed,  by several friends of mine. They were so supportive as I unpacked  having found out, and so reassuring. They were anxious about being  intimate in light of what happened to me, and I tried to reassure them  as best I could.\n\nThe more time  went on though, and I processed what happened to me, I grew less  comfortable with intimacy. The thought of being intimate in any way -  even being held in sensitive places, or being kissed - was too much for  me. So much of romance was, and is, tainted for me, because of the way I  was groomed. I was groomed with the same means - kissing and cuddling  and gentle, intimate scenes.\n\nI  expressed this and I said that I wasn't comfortable with touch. I  understand that this is a heavy burden, but it was as if after I  expressed this boundary, they seemed to bring it up more and more.  Intimacy, of different kinds, even though I'd expressed I was not  comfortable with this. I tried defusing and navigating each instance as  best I could, but I felt more and more as if my boundaries were being  pushed against. I tried to be gentle but also firm, and I just... I felt  like it was too much. I couldn't give them what they wanted. They'd keep bringing it up and I didn't know what to do.\n\nI  broke up with them last year, and I'm still sad over it. I know they  are, but I have a deep and abiding shame. I feel like I was wrong to  express my boundaries, but I also know that this was a heavy ask, and  that I felt - and still do feel - my boundaries were being pushed. I  felt as if I couldn't be the partner that they needed me to be, if  that's what they wanted.\n\nSince I broke up over it... I've been scared that I've traumatized them, too. I miss who I used to be - I worry I was so scared over becoming toxic and abusive in perpetuating the same trauma I went through somehow that I withdrew in fear and became toxic over that way. I feel a lot of shame, and I feel like I've broken down and fallen apart... I'm just scared that I've inevitably become an abusive and toxic person and I don't know what to do. I'm trying to heal from my sexual trauma but I still feel imprisoned, and worse, I feel as if I'll never be a kind person again.  \n\n\nI don't know what to do. Does anyone have any advice?  \n",

    "selftext": "Posting this on behalf of a friend:\nBackground Info: I am 13, my sister is 15. Not sure if this is important but I also have Autism.\nMe and my sister both had hard childhood. She's sort of in denial about it, but it sucked. My mom was chronically angry, and my dad was mostly absent, and when we had to deal with this we went two, very different routes. I was hypersensitive and emotional (switching from happy to sad quickly, taking everything as a personal attack, and responding to any problem with tears) and my sister took and entirely different route. Anger. She would constantly lash out at the smallest things and had a hair trigger temper, and she was very self centered. Although it was in the past, when she was around my age she said a lot of very hurtful things and did some very hurtful things (Ex: Said my suicide attempt was for attention, outing me for being gay to my homophobic mom as a \"joke\")\n\nI eventually got help and she did too, but she decided that she didn't want to go to a therapist anymore or continue working on herself after the first one wasn't a fit for her. (My first one wasn't a fit but we kept searching.) She slowly improved over the years due to an increase in friends, and because most of her \"bad times\" were 12-14, a time where you're dealing with a lot of emotions with little knowledge on her to deal with tthem.\n\nBut she's still really insufferable. She still has a hair trigger temper and gets very angry, very easily and is still quite narcissistic along with lazy. Until about a month ago she had me doing her laundry and she never cleaned around the house even when asked. She still left her dirty dishes out around the house and it was really gross. She also has this general, condescending tone around her, and she actively takes pride in being a dick. I've come to her before to try and properly express my emotions but she shut me down instantly, saying that she didn't care and liked being an asshole. She makes it obvious in every way, shape, and form that she doesn't care and thinks she's better than us, me specifically. She's said she thinks I'm weak because I'm sensitive. Meanwhile whenever something bad happens to her, I'm one of the first people she comes to. She confides in me about a lot of things. Ranting to me about her interests, telling me stories in her head, asking me for advice while I happily listen. Yet she won't do any of that for me. Honestly the roles of oldest and youngest seem swapped around in this case. And yet she seldom apologizes for any of the pain she causes me despite how much I do for her.\n\nMy parents refuse to properly parent her as they are more focused on being liked than making a responsible adult, so they leave me to do a lot of the work. Enforce things, resolve issues, and I can't have any issues with her because \"we're sisters\" and she'll \"help me in the future\" and everything is \"God's plan.\" Yet they can hate her and argue with her, no problem. Due to this, and me being younger and naive I always stuck with her and tried to help her despite how crappy she treated me. I admired her, unable to realize how (and I mean this in the kindest way possible) pathetic she was. I tried to help her for so long, trying to act as an open place to express her emotions, very rarely genuinely getting mad at her and yelling. But nothing ever improved. It just got worse and worse and worse.\n\nDue to this behavior she became sort of a scapegoat, with me as the golden child. (Keep in mind that this doesn't mean my life was easy, nobody in an abusive household benefits from the whole thing.) I tried to sympathize with her, and I've tried to do this up until age 13. By then when I began realizing her behavior I jumped on the bandwagon of hating her. I get that she's traumatized and I get that she needs help and I get that anger is a perfectly normal trauma response, but she reminds me so much of my mom , but a version of her at her worst. I see the woman whose caused me the most pain and suffering in my sister. She's so much like her. The narcissism, the anger, the everything. But the thing is that my mom has been slowly improving, and my sister hasn't. I don't know what to do here. I'm trying to disengage but I see her acting so nice and it's hard to believe that I'm right in hating her. \n\nSo, am I right to dislike her? Do I have the right to disengage for her in the entirety? Or am I just being an unempathetic asshole? I'm tired of trying to help her, playing peacemaker. I did it for so long and it's only caused me pain, and it's obvious she doesn't truly care about me so why should I care about her. While we're at it, how much should I disengage, if I should? I kind of want to cut her off completely but I don't know how. She still rants to me and I go along with it to be polite, along with all the other stuff she does mentioned above. Do I cut her off and ignore her when she does that? What do I do? Specific instructions would be appreciated.",

    "selftext": "Hi, this is a genuine question. Would it be ethical to use psycadelic mushrooms as a resource. I've been researching about resourcing and tried understanding what bilateral stimulation really is. I was wondering if incorporating and tapping the experience surrounding mushrooms is a bad idea as it may cause strong associations between feelings of safety and acceptance. Could it cause me to lean on actual mushrooms for comfort. Is this a bad path to go down? Is this even how resourcing works? Like if I chose to tap in my dog as a resource would I be more inclined to hangout with him and spend time with him? In other words could this lead to dependance or unhealthy relationship to mushrooms?",

    "selftext": "TLDR (and TW: Sexual Assault)- my husband inadvertently (this was a BDSM scenario with some grey area) sexually assaulted me by finishing inside of me after I revoked consent. [You can read more about the situation ‚Äî it‚Äôs complicated ‚Äî in my original post in r/sexualassault here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/s/GucpcpAE1t) \n\nI need to make it clear that I don‚Äôt want to leave him. He has been a phenomenal husband aside from this, we‚Äôve been together for nearly a decade and I believe wholeheartedly that he is my soulmate and the love of my life. We have been through so much together and we understand each other better than anyone ever could. That‚Äôs what makes this so hard.\n\nHe made a terrible mistake but didn‚Äôt realize it in the moment, and I truly believe that he is a good man and had no malicious intent. He has taken full accountability and feels like a monster, he‚Äôs horrified by what he did. I know in my heart it will never happen again. \n\nI don‚Äôt mean to make excuses for him. I know that what he did was sexual assault. I also know that two things can be true: he didn‚Äôt intend to violate me, but his actions made me feel violated.\n\nI want to move past this. I want to forgive him. I want to feel safe around him again. But at the same time, I‚Äôm distraught. How do I cope with this? How do I move forward in my relationship with him? Will I ever feel safe being intimate with him again?\n\nI feel like he brought my whole world crashing down on me in an instant. I‚Äôm dissociating and I can‚Äôt focus on anything. I just can‚Äôt even conceptualize the words ‚Äúsexual assault‚Äù being attributed to him. It doesn‚Äôt add up. I can‚Äôt process it. \n\nEverything I know to be true tells me that he would never do something like that to me. My brain tells me I‚Äôm overreacting and these words are accusations that are too big and harsh to explain what happened. That because I enjoyed it until that point and I wanted him to take more control, the lines were blurred. My gut tells me that really didn‚Äôt mean it and I know that he‚Äôs remorseful. I feel like logically, I should be enraged, but I can‚Äôt muster it. Every time I think about it I can‚Äôt help but cry. I don‚Äôt know what to feel. I don‚Äôt know what to do. \n\nAll I know is that he has always been my safe space and I can‚Äôt lose that. I can‚Äôt lose him. All I want is to feel safe in his arms again, but right now it just feels wrong.\n\nAnd because I know I‚Äôm not leaving him, I don‚Äôt have anyone to talk to. I don‚Äôt want anyone thinking badly of him or thinking less of me for choosing to stay with him.\n\nI‚Äôm seeing my therapist tomorrow and we‚Äôre both starting couples counseling. He‚Äôs made it clear that he will do everything he can to regain my trust and make me feel safe around him again. In the meantime, how do I cope with this? How do I move forward?",

The study consists of three parts. First, you will perform tasks related to the needs of domestic violence survivors. You will be asked to use our developed chatbot and a search engine/or ChatGPT to perform these tasks which are centered on evaluating the technological capabilities in providing informational, emotional, and instrumental support. After completing each task in our developed chatbot condition, you will be required to answer a set of questions in a cognitive walkthrough. Second, you will respond to survey questionnaires about your perception of technologies in terms of usability, quality of information, social reactions, and others. Lastly, we will conduct a short interview with you to discuss your views on the used technologies. The overall study is expected to last 75\\~90 minutes via a video conferencing tool like Zoom. During the study sessions, we will utilize video recording to capture the screen, aiming to gain insights into your user experience and observe your progress as you complete the tasks. The interview will be audio-recorded. We will provide each participant with a $25 Amazon gift card for their participation. The study has been approved by the UNC Charlotte IRB-23-0836.\n\nIf you are interested in participating, please take the screening questionnaire at [https://surveys.qualtrics.charlotte.edu/jfe/form/SV\\_7Qc53222beNhQAS](https://surveys.qualtrics.charlotte.edu/jfe/form/SV_7Qc53222beNhQAS).

    "selftext": "I (18) have CPTSD resulting from childhood abuse by my father. I was abused for the majority of my life, since I was 4, and I don‚Äôt have siblings - I now can recognize the ways I changed due to what happened, and of course don‚Äôt want this to happen to anyone else. \n\nThat brings me to my question; for context my mom‚Äôs sister has three kids with her husband, we share grandparents. She first had twins (M7 - B; F7 - A) and then another (M5 - C); their daughter (who I‚Äôll call A for simplicity) is very obviously their least favorite. She is often ignored as her brothers get all of her parents attention - from what I know this is due to constant misbehavior. A has started acting differently, she was not bad before, but now she completely avoids any mistakes. When she is around just my grandparents, my mom, and I alone, without her brothers I see that she does whatever she can to make people happy and just want to engage with her in general.\nWhile we were alone with her, A shared that she realizes C is her parent‚Äôs favorite. This is something we (grandparents, mom, me) had all discussed in private and also always agreed that C is their favorite. My mom asked A if she ever considered talking to her mom about this, and she let us know that she did. My aunt told her that it‚Äôs not fair, and life isn‚Äôt fair. \nPersonally I hate the saying. I was always told that as a kid when I complained, the signs of my abuse were suppressed with this. I more than the people I‚Äôm close with understand life isn‚Äôt fair, but in a situation where someone is making something unfair, they can‚Äôt simply say life is unfair.\nIt‚Äôs a little different being their cousin than a parent, so I don‚Äôt feel bad saying that A is my favorite. The others are too challenging, and she also loves spending time with me. But when discussing all of this with my mom she does completely agree with me.\n\nI wanted some advice on how to handle the situation? It‚Äôs hard for me to watch her deal with this and not be able to do much to make her feel special and like she doesn‚Äôt need to make everyone happy.",

Part of me thinks it‚Äôs not true, but at the slightest sign of dislike I would immediately doubt my entire relationship with the person, no matter how much good time we‚Äôve had before and I think those good time spent together were genuine. \n\nIn general, most people treat me pretty good, I‚Äôm not very close to my parents but we‚Äôre in good terms with each other. I am very close to my best friend from middle school to this day, and we still hang out and it has always been a great time when we hang out. I try my best to trust that the people around me really enjoy my presence in their lives, but at the end of the day I still hold my doubt against that for some reason, it is starting to take a toll on my mental health tbh. \n\nSo, I was actually almost kidnapped when I was 6, and I feel like this might have caused whatever trust issues I have right now. My parents brought us overseas for a vacation, and as we were walking back to the tour bus at the parking lot outside of a tourist attraction, I was walking behind my parents and elder sister. This old lady selling fruits at the parking lot grabbed me from behind and covered my mouth as I watched my family leaving me without noticing I was being left behind. I tried to scream but I couldn‚Äôt because my mouth was covered, and I couldn‚Äôt escape because I was just a kid so I couldn‚Äôt overpower her grip. At one point, they were far enough that she probably thought it was okay to uncover my mouth, I also do not have a loud voice so my parents probably wouldn‚Äôt hear it if I screamed. I took the opportunity to bite her arm as hard as I could, but she still wouldn‚Äôt let me go.\n\nI was already giving up, just thinking how my life was gonna change, being left behind in a foreign country, and my parents had told me news about children being kidnapped, having their limbs and tongues cut off and forced to be beggars by some organized criminal organization. \n\nWell thankfully my sister saw me eventually and screamed. The old lady immediately released me, and our tour guide confronted her, but she said she was just playing with me. My parents believed her and our day just went on like normal, I was also behaving like a normal kid after that anyway. \n\nWasn‚Äôt until recently my dad was talking about how he thinks parents shouldn‚Äôt waste money on bringing their kids on vacation until they are old enough, by ‚Äúold enough‚Äù he meant old enough to remember the trip, and then he proceeded to ask me if I remembered my first vacation (which was the vacation mentioned here) and I told him I only remember I was almost kidnapped, he just kinda laughed and said nothing as if everything is just a joke.\n\nAny coping strategies that have helped anyone before are welcomed, I am getting tired of always feeling this way, as much as I love being alone, I do feel lonely sometimes because it feels like nobody really likes me.

My childhood best friend had me become his therapist friend x100. He threatened his life every single day and never took a single piece of advice or support I gave to heart. Multiple hours every single day for 3 years. I'm kinda convinced that he did it because he wanted to date me, but even when I agreed to date him to keep him from following through, he wasn't happy. It completely destroyed me and the majority of my issues come from that event.\n\nI spent 4 years after completely numb and emotionless to the point where I couldn't recognize what I was feeling anymore, unhealing because he was still around me even if we didn't speak anymore. Now it's been 3 years since I've seen him and since I started healing, but I can't help but be frustrated. I feel like such a kid for having shallow emotions, even though I know why. I hate how similar emotions feel, like how fear and excitement are so similar to me. I have a crush on someone, and it took me 9 months to actually accept the fact that the complicated ball of feelings I was feeling was romantic love. The entire time of those 9 months I was frustrated and terrified because of how overwhelming those feelings were. \n\nI just want to move on from my trauma and catch up with everyone else but I know that's not possible. I already have ADHD which was gonna make me struggle with understanding my emotions but now I'm 7 years behind everyone in my emotional maturity on top of that and I don't really know what to do about it.",

I said to her \"I just can't talk to you anymore, no matter what I try, you can't be angry with me for explaining my problems to you, it can't get any better like this. I'm explaining my feelings, why I'm sad and you're ignoring it, so I just can't talk to you anymore.\" After I said that, she just said, \"Yes, but if you need anything from me, you always ask me.\" My whole family was totally shocked because I was never allowed to say why I was feeling bad, otherwise she threatened me with more problems.

The world sometimes stops feeling real. What is wrong with me\n\nWhen I'm in certain types of stressful situations it feels like my emotions kind of flip and stuff that would make me upset normally doesn't have any effect anymore. Physical pain stops mattering at all and i can't feel much pain emotionally. I have a desire to be hurt physically(destroyed might be a more accurate term) but I'm not a masochist at all. Me getting hurt is amusing when i feel like this. My empathy reduces from high to a bit low. This mainly happens if i see something related to death(like on the news or a car crash but funerals don't trigger it) or others in pain sometimes but can also just be after someone hurts me or something generally upsetting. Seeing certain things or someone making unwanted advances can too (especially if sexual in nature). If someone is cruel to me it also kicks in or if i am in a moderate amount of pain (only certain types of pain though). I go from my positive happy silly mood to a sort of nothing can hurt me any more feeling. I also feel a compulsion to start breaking my body as in snapping bones, dislocating fingers, biting myself or other stuff(never cutting though) although i don't act on this. Is there some explanation for this? I am very sure i don't have did or osdd or anything like that. But there is a very distinct difference between these states. I don't want to be told this is multiple personalities or anything because i am still me but just altered somehow. Certain music can trigger this and certian music can make me feel normal again\n\nI feel so weird for having this issue and I'm scared what others would think of me if they knew i experience this which is why throwaway account.

I have always wanted to know why? Why did you not want to be part of my life? Why was it so easy for you to just throw me away?\n\nI learned to ride a bike without you. My sister taught me that. You showed up that day. Right after I finally got it and didn't need her to hold onto the bike anymore. I was so excited, I ran up to you, screaming to tell you that I could do it all on my own. You dismissed it. You were only there for your tools. My excitement drained quickly when you and my mom started fighting. I wrapped around your legs, begging you to take me with you. That was also the last time I had seen you for another 9 years.\n\nWhen I was almost 15, I had called you because my mom, my brother and I were going to WV to visit. I was told that I could see you when we got there. I was on a walk with my boyfriend when I called you. I had so much excitement and at one point I was actually spinning with joy. Your response was that you didn't want to see my mom.. I broke down and was scream crying in the phone begging you. The phone call ended with a no. My sister had to call you to tell you to grow a pair.\n\nWe met you at your work because you didn't want to take the day off. We sat for lunch, and you didn't talk to me at all.. You talked to my mom, who you claim to hate so much. You talked to my brother, who was too small to even remember who you even were when we left. I tried speaking, but, nothing was coming out. What was I supposed to say? You had all of these questions for everyone else, except me.\n\nFast forward, Im 16. April, 19th, 2009. My boyfriend and I just got back to my house. I was in so much pain. I keeled over and was in fetal position. I was screaming. I didn't know what was happening. I started throwing up blood. My boyfriend ran to get my mom. He picks me up and carries me to the car and held me the whole time. I was in the E.R for 8 hours before my room was swarmed with a surgeon and 6 doctors. She made my family leave, and said they needed to do emergency surgery right away.\n\nI was 15 minutes away from dying. I had 2 liters of blood backed up into my stomach and crushing the surrounding organs. I was bleeding to death. I had an ovarian cyst that ruptured that was the size of a plum. You were called and didn't answer. You never returned anyone's calls. For 14 years, you have never said anything about it. I mean so little to you, that me staring death in the face, didn't mean shit to you.\n\nI stared death in the face and I lived. But, I lost a big part of me that day. Because of it, I can't conceive. I cannot be a mom that I have wanted my entire life. I was left with a huge hole in my heart, added to the one that you caused.\n\nI needed you, and even when you were right there, I couldn't reach you.\n\nI learned a lot from you though. I learned never to take family for granted. To always be there for them no matter what, because, even when they don't need you, they absolutely need you. I learned that you have to stay strong and be who you are destined to be. I learned never to rely on someone else. I learned to not need a dad. I learned that I am stronger, smarter, and better than you. I learned that you missed out on an amazing life that involved your daughter.\n\nYou will never know the life that I have lived. You see pictures and hear stories but you will never know the real, raw, life that I live. You will never know the accomplishments that I have done. You will never know the suffering that you put me through. The mental illness that I am challenged with every day. You will never know how hard I work to be happy. How hard I work to be a good wife. You will never know me..\n\nI spent years of my life, wondering why you didn't want me. Why I wasn't good enough for you. But then, it hit me. You are the one who isn't good enough for me.\n\nYou will never be who I thought you were. A dad.",

I also never post on reddit, nor do I use it much, so forgive me if im ignorant somewhere.\n\nI've had a lot of parental issues growing up (not sure if i would class it as abuse, but that's unrelated and something i need to work through) but I went through an emotionally abusive relationship through highschool. She was emotionally distant, would pick on and belittle me. I was head over heels for her, bordering on obsession. I won't go too into detail, but just know this relationship has been hard to move on from for quite a while and has left me with a lot of anxiety.\n\nSince then, I've found it very difficult to form new potentially romantic relationships. I met a guy online  a few years ago who, after a year of being in a d&d campaign with him on discord and talking to him quite frequently, i developed a crush and ended up telling him a little sooner than I expected due to a small argument the whole group had. We rushed into a relationship, and my crush was still there and I felt like I was head over heels again, until all of a sudden after a month it completely fizzled out and I ended up almost hating him. Everything he did would annoy me and I had to scramble to find a way out of that relationship. I still feel so bad for doing that and hurting him like I did, but it fizzled out so quickly despite nothing being wrong with him at all.\n\nI decided a year or so later to start looking again, so I joined a dating site. I met this girl who had the same music taste as me, and a lot of similar interests. She really liked me and I liked her, and she was so sweet and wanted to get into all of the things im interested in as well. For a month or two i was also head over heels for her, thought she was a bit cheesy but cute. I met her once in person with a friend, and I think thats where it all went a bit downhill. I started getting really anxious about whether I actually liked her, if i liked how she looked and her personality, to the point where now I get annoyed if she messages me (she messages a lot, goodmorning and goodnight, and I cant fault her for it because I reciprocated until recently. I used to think it was really cute, but now I feel overwhelmed) and while I don't feel any negative feelings towards her yet, Im terrified i will. I feel like i am/was really attracted to her personality and I dont want this to fizzle out but I don't know what to do. I don't know if these two people truly aren't my type, or theres an issue with my own mental health stopping me from committing to an actual relationship.\n\nI would like to get therapy, but in my country its a bit difficult, so im working on that. If you have any suggestions or questions, I'd really really appreciate it. I just need to shed some light on my own thought process, or what the issue could be, because its been plaguing me for a while.\n\n&#x200B;",

The advice I‚Äôm seeking is: if you‚Äôre going through or have gone through something like this with ptsd and a partner who thinks it‚Äôs just an excuse to abuse, how did you get through it? How did you get through to them?",

    "selftext": "1. I have a poor memory, even though I'm a med student (a very dumb one).\n2. Every time I tell some story from my childhood or of the recent events of my life I always get shocked looks. Well, sometimes amused shocked looks, bc I know how to tell my story in a funny way. But, the thing is, I genuinely don't feel anything bad happened to me. I mean, there are some minor effects and I know, intellectually, that some of things that happened are not okay at all. But! Almost all my memories (except the ones that become parts of my dreams) ARE just funny, entertaining stories to me. I don't feel sad about any of them. There are some memories that sometimes make me hurry up to the nearest window to jump, or a train, if close. (I never do the finishing step so lol obv false alarm every time, but I do stand on the edge very, very often, and look down. few times people stopped me from finishing tho) But those are not some traumatic memories - not about CSA I experienced, not about violence in my childhood, but instead only the simple ones that I'm deeply ashamed of: failed conversations, awkward looks, missed meetings, you know, ordinary things everyone experience. Those are the only memories I can call mine with 100000% certainty in my heart and those are the ones I usually don't remember, they come in vivid flashes, always different and pretty often, and I immediately stop controlling myself,. I usually bang my head against some wall or table real hard and fast without even thinking. One hit is usually enough. the memories can be 10 years old or just yesterday's. lol. I immediately FORGET about those everyday life shame memories after each episode, like it never happened. Erased. \n\nBut actual, important everyday life memories are slipping from me. I can forget a conversation I had few hours ago. So when I tell a story to myself or to people it's also a way to remind myself about what was happening at the moment. But as soon as I start talking it feels like I'm making everything up, like none of the described things happen. On the one hand it means that no matter how horrible telling should be it's not and it's usually an entertaining story. On the other, I feel like I have no memories AT ALL. no matter bad or good or neutral. it's like I'm an empty glass ringing.",

    "selftext": "I didn't have much of a teenagerhood. I stopped going to school when I was 13 because I have severe sensory issues that made school painful and overwhelming. I was homeschooled for the rest of high school and didn't have any friends. At age 15 I started living on my own. When I was 17 I met someone at my job who was very charismatic and interesting. My dream was to be a filmmaker, but I knew that would be impossible being poor, working in a grocery store, and living in this small town. This man was a filmmaker and he wouldn't stop talking about his projects. He was 33 years old, which is very old when you're only in between 11th and 12th grade.\n\nIt's a long story, but over time he groomed me. I did not want a relationship with him but he convinced me that I did. He did nearly everything without my consent, including the moment he took my virginity. He lived with his friends who were between the ages of 32 and 46. They wanted to \"take me in\" and said they were my chosen family. They feel like the \"other family\" from Coraline. When I'm at my house they miss me and really want to see me. Two of them are 35 and 41, and they miss me, an 18-year-old, very badly and need to have me around. It creeps me out.\n\nI broke up with him but I'm still in contact with his friends. They're all I have and nowhere near as bad as he was. They are making me very uncomfortable though, like parents I didn't ask for. They wanted to sit down with me and discuss what I was going to do with my life. Isolation is scary but this is too. \n\nI'm going to be 19 in a couple weeks. I don't want to lose my young adulthood like I lost my teenage years. I'm not going to college and I don't know where to meet people.\n\nI have nightmares almost every night about this man. It is turning my days into nightmares as well. I used to want a relationship so badly, and now I'm terrified of them. I see scenes in movies where couples flirt and kiss and it makes me so uncomfortable. I hated being touched all the time without my consent. I had no reference and thought it was normal.\n\nI feel broken. I need someone to talk to.",

    "title": "How can I get rid of my jealousy?",
    "selftext": " Hello there,\n\n  \nto be honest, I don't know how to start this, nor do I know if it fits in here at all. If not, please just delete it. And to be honest, I feel bad posting such \"nonsense\" here after reading the problems some people describe here.\n\n  \nI have a best friend (he is transgender, FtM and still unassigned as we are both only 17, he came out to me a few weeks ago) and I love him. I've loved him more than anything for about 5-6 years. But I am sometimes extremely jealous. When I notice that he makes contact with other people (the last few years it's always been more of a him-and-me-against-the-rest-of-the-world thing) and now he keeps writing to new people. And that actually makes me extremely happy, because the only thing I really want is for him to be happy. But when he keeps telling me about these people, I get extremely jealous for whatever reason. I'm afraid that he'll meet someone with whom he'll get on better than with me. That I will lose the only person I really have and need in my life. And fall into oblivion, as if I had never been there in the first place. He keeps telling me that this will never happen and he once told me that if he could love (which he can't, he's not the relationship type), I would be that person. He also brought the whole thing up again today, as we were doing something like this and he said he would love me like his family. For him, that's the highest affection he can show, as I said, he's not a love type.  \nBut if he even assures me of this, why am I so afraid of being replaced? He talked to me yesterday about how there are special things you can do to extremely influence him, make him dependent on you and \"use\" him. I know how, but I would never do something like that and would never want to do it, he's worth far too much to me for that and something like that is generally just dishonest. He says that he doesn't really want that, that he jumps at things and then becomes extremely dependent on people like that. One such person then made him send him a picture of his lower back area. And when he told me that, I didn't know what was happening to me. I didn't say anything about it because it would have been far too inappropriate in that situation. I tried to help him and he said that he had already shot the person down, but she had also tried to blackmail him with the picture. I still feel extremely uncomfortable writing this now. I don't know why. I shouldn't really be interested in who he sends what to. It's his life. And he can do whatever he wants. I don't know how I feel. It's strange. And extremely uncomfortable, I think. And I don't want to feel that. I don't want to feel jealous of every person he talks to. I want to be there for him. And I don't want to let that get so close to me. I don't want these feelings for him, for his sake. I would do anything for him to be happy. But I don't know how I can get rid of these feelings. They may seem harmless as written, but these shitty love feelings have almost driven me to suicide (combined with a few other things). And it's eating me up. I don't know what to do anymore. I don't know what to do. I can't go on like this. I don't want to go on like this. I only ever think about him. I see him every day, write to him every day and I think we're the closest people we have to each other. And I would wait another 20 years if I knew that he reciprocated these feelings. Or even if he didn't return them. But I don't want him to hopefully find someone one day who makes him happy and who might make him feel loved and then I'm still so attached to him. I think that would drive me to the end of my life. I still wouldn't care, I don't give much of a damn about myself. But he tells me that it also burdens him when I have something. And as I said, he's the only one I have. I spoke to my parents a year ago because I suspected that I was suffering from depression. My father shouted at me and didn't talk to me for a week, my mother took me to the doctor once, but she wasn't really enthusiastic either, so I left the subject alone to avoid any more stress. Only he was there for me and understood me.  \nPositive emotions are becoming increasingly rare for me, played out or don't last long. Negativity runs from morning to night at the moment. Either that or I feel nothing, just emptiness. I don't know what to do anymore.\n\n  \nI know this text got quite long . I couldn't express everything the way I would have liked to and all in all it got pretty confusing, for which I apologize!\n\nI hope you can still roughly understand my point of view and as I said, if this doesn't fit in here/wrong or is a lot of mimimi about nothing, then please just delete the post or tell me.\n\n  \nPlease feel free to comment or dm me if you have any tips or criticism.\n\n  \nI hope you can help me, because¬†I¬†can't.

I went to purchase a cigarette  at a shop and there were these two high guys sitting nearby, acting troublesome. \n\nBefore I purchased my cigarette, I was feeding a dog nearby and that caught their attention because it was happening right next to them and they kept commenting about it in the local language that I didn‚Äôt understand. All the time they were looking at me and laughing between themselves but I didn‚Äôt react to it except just ask them in a normal tone why they were laughing which they didn‚Äôt answer. \n\nI bought my cigarette and as I was lighting it one of them clicked a photo of me and the other started pointing his action in a cheeky sorta way. I got offended and immediately walked over to snatch his phone, which I couldn‚Äôt and those guys started fighting me or more specifically both of them were repeatedly slapping on the same part of my head. \n\nThis went on for a while and I tried landing a few hits on them but mostly I was getting beaten. I‚Äôm not strong or anything and apart from a few small fight in schools that would resolve quickly, I‚Äôve never been in a proper fight that lasted long. But tbh, deep down I was hesitant of striking them with full force because I was afraid of doing something bad and then facing legal consequences. It also didn‚Äôt help there were two of them and only one of me. Truth is, I was weak and I got my ass handed to me.\n\nUltimately one of them picked up a rock and struck on that part of head with it. I was lucky they hit on a part of my upper skull and not my eye or my ear. I suffered a pretty big wound, lost a lot of blood and ran off to my hostel where someone took me to a hospital.\n\nIt‚Äôs been two months since that incident and I have since moved to a different city for my masters. The place where I live, there is a guy that lives right below me who‚Äôs got these massive speakers that make my whole room vibrate. \n\nFor a while now I‚Äôve been asking him on text to lower the base and he does so everytime though I find it annoying he doesn‚Äôt get the hint that I ask him to lower the volume almost everyday now so maybe he shouldn‚Äôt play so loudly or the fact that he‚Äôs living in a common residential property and shouldn‚Äôt be playing his speakers so loudly so frequently like he does (sometimes he‚Äôll start playing at odd hours like 8 am or 3 am).\n\nI had previously tried resolving this through the building manager who was a complete idiot and told this dude who I was and my room number (despite my explicitly asking him not to do so). He confronted and me and told me to text him if I get disturbed. He‚Äôs been amicable everytime I‚Äôve texted him although we don‚Äôt have long conversations or anything.\n\nI know I hesitate to tell him to turn it down as much as I would like to because the guy‚Äôs a little muscular and I‚Äôm scared of getting on his wrong side, though he‚Äôs been polite so far.\n\nToday he came up to my room for the first time, with a friend of his and asked me if I was getting disturbed. He‚Äôd previously texted me to ask me if it was okay with me if he‚Äôd play music more loudly for the next five day as it‚Äôs Diwali and I said sure so I didn‚Äôt know why he felt the need to come up to my room. He was smoking a vape and he seemed high. And I felt scared the entire time. My heart was a little racy and in mind I kept picturing a scenario similar to the fight I was in. It effected my ability to converse. I felt weak.\n\nI realise I am traumatised by that incident in a way. I want to heal.

I know it seems obvious if I‚Äôm not super close to not tell them but let me provide some background. \n\nI have an older brother (30m) who my whole family except my parents sometimes is no contact with for 10 years. He‚Äôs an abusive narcissist, and was physically and emotionally abusive my whole childhood. Growing up with him was not easy for any of us, and all my parents did was scream at eachother and neglect us other kids if I‚Äôm being honest. I also have experienced SA as a young kid from a cousin, and was sa at 19 while living with my parents (they don‚Äôt know about the sa)\n\nBack to the issue: I have PTSD from all of this, my symptoms came on this year and have gotten bad. I have flashbacks, panic attacks, and sometimes pass out. Basically, I may not have a choice in telling them if I have an episode. But I‚Äôm wondering how much I should tell them.\n\nI‚Äôm still angry with them for not protecting us, not removing him from the house, and I‚Äôm especially angry with my mom - when I was 8 she caught my cousin and asked me about it but I told her it was a game (which I thought it was) and she never did anything else to stop it. By the time I realized what had happened to me, I had also realized I‚Äôm bisexual (parents super religious and I‚Äôm not out to them) and I thought if I told them they‚Äôd hate me for it cause it was gay. (cousin was a female) then as I got older my relationship with my parents was further strained esp my mom and I figured, since she caught the cousin, she must already hate me.\n\nSo yeah I‚Äôm angry, but I also feel like if I don‚Äôt talk to them about it and ask why I wasn‚Äôt protected‚Ä¶I‚Äôll never really be able to heal. But Is it even worth talking about? Is it worth drudging up old shit from your childhood with your parents and causing them pain? Wouldn‚Äôt my dad finding out about my mom catching my cousin and doing nothing strain their relationship? Would they even believe me? How do you even have this convo? Is it better to just‚Ä¶.not?\n\nThanks in advance, sorry it‚Äôs a bit of a messy read but my head is also messy.",

The major thing is that my older sister would make me play this ‚Äúgame‚Äù with her that she called ‚Äúmom and dad‚Äù. When it started, I was too young to know any better but when I got a little older (maybe 9-10) I thought it was weird so I didn‚Äôt want to ‚Äúplay‚Äù it anymore but she would get mad, so I would still ‚Äúplay‚Äù it. The reason I didn‚Äôt say anything was because I didn‚Äôt know any better and didn‚Äôt understand what was happening. Thankfully it stopped, but a few years later my parents/other older sibling found out but thought that it was ‚Äúconsensual‚Äù. \n\nI have had periodic bad dreams about it since I was younger and I think it contributed to behavioral issues when I was growing up, including trying to ‚Äúunalive‚Äù myself in high school. When I finally realized what it really was, I asked myself why my sister would do it and it occurred to me that my father was molesting her. Because of that, I cannot blame her nor have I ever said anything to my family, so I just deal with the hidden away pain from it whenever it comes up. I‚Äôve talked to the wife about it briefly and I have told my therapist that there‚Äôs some things I need to talk about but don‚Äôt know when I‚Äôll be ready. I just don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm being dramatic and if I should drop it. My therapist, without knowing the story, thinks it might be trauma which I honestly don‚Äôt know.

    "selftext": "TW: detailed background of sexual trauma ive experienced to provide some explanation to my issues and triggers. \n\nIf you make it through reading this/respond to this you are seriously amazing and I appreciate you endlessly. Please be somewhat gentle with me - this is something I've never been able to type out or seek advice because I am humiliated about this side of my brain. \n\nSo I (26F) have a lot of sexually based trauma. I experienced a very traumatizing SA as a young child, and also grew up in a very sexual environment. As in my mom falling asleep with pornography on the TV in the living room, adam & eve catalogues laying around - the list goes on. I ended up on the side of the survivor spectrum where i was extremely promiscuous entirely too early in life.  I was married at 18, to a legitimate porn addict and this resulted in a litany of issues - gaslighting, marital sexual abuse, spousal rape, humiliation, etc. It was also an extremely physically abusive relationship by time I left the relationship at 21. Needless to say - this relationship left me ESPECIALLY insecure and damaged. And then at 22, while drunk I was violently SA by a \"close friend\" and coworker after I left a 4th of july (good ol' merica) party pretty smashed - this is someone i trusted a lot and this damaged me A LOT. \n\nNow here's my issue - I am a fairly non \"vanilla\" person when it comes to intimacy and sex in life and my relationship that I've been in for over 4 years now. But I am EXTREMELY triggered by pornography and/or nudity or sex scenes in TV shows - and I hate to admit it but it is worse especially when it's like a TV show I'm watching with my partner. I mean, I'm talking it triggers me to IRRATIONAL anger. My anxiety over the situation manifests in straight rage (which I would assume is a coping mechanism.) But I HATE that I am almost 30 years old and can't see a damn virtual titty without regressing into that level of an emotional response. It's definitely a mix of insecurity, discomfort, and just *trauma*. But it physically affects (God damnit is it effects? I always mix these up) me from the level of emotional response. I have tried to just force myself to sit through it, ive tried to watch it alone to see if I can handle it, ive tried to dissect the response mentally, but no matter what I do I just cannot force myself to not go into that level of irrationally upset and uncomfortable. I don't UNDERSTAND what's wrong with me, I haven't found anyone who really understands which makes me feel *really* alone and irrational. Therapy isn't an option at this point in time because lord knows I'd skip walking and SPRINT to talk to a professional about this. \n\nI guess what I want to know is if maybe someone feels this way too? Any ideas as to how I can process these moments in a rational and healthy way to be able to watch all the shows I'm missing out on? Maybe someone can help me understand why I have SUCH an emotional trigger regarding this. Please feel free to be blatantly honest with me, but I'm begging please have some compassion because I truly hate and despise this reaction and trigger and myself for being so sensitive to it. I feel immature and dumb and small.",

    "selftext": "Last year I knowingly and intentionally became involved in a situation where an older man was paying me for sex and dates. It didn't last long because he immediately insisted that we stop using protection which made me uncomfortable. I allowed him to hit it without a condom once and then called things off the next day. He argued with me and sort of insulted me but I didn't see him again. This was part of a year-long bender of me getting involved in extreme sexual situations--things like sex with older men (15+ year age gaps), sugaring, sex with strangers, orgies, multiple sexual partners in one week, BDSM, etc etc. Occasionally I wanted sex, sometimes I wanted a new experience, often I wanted validation, usually, I just wanted company and sex was the easiest way to get it. It got to the point where I would do things like forget the name of the person I was having sex with while I was having sex with them. I hate that that happened because I have myself been that girl who was just another body. I hate that now I've been on the other end of that power dynamic. I don't want this behavior to continue.\n\nIn the past, I've had more than one encounter I would classify as sexual abuse/rape; during one of these instances I was very young and had only just had my first kiss, this was how I lost my virginity. I had a grey-area encounter with this person again the summer after, and a year after that was raped and then promptly dumped by a boyfriend. I've also had several \"situationships\" where I regularly have sex with a person who is not interested in emotional investment. I did have one really great boyfriend a little while ago, but my relationship with him really underlined how sexually wounded I feel.\n\nI've read about how people who have sexual trauma use hypersexuality as a way to seize control of their bodies and identities. I think I definitely do that. I guess as I work through some of the more explicit abuse, I've been thinking if regrettable choices I made as an adult and free, developed, aware individual could still be considered traumas. How many of these people were taking advantage of me? How many was I taking advantage of? Is there reading or insights you guys could recommend on how to cope with the shame and confusion of post-traumatic hypersexuality? \n\nYes I am in therapy and yes I plan on talking about this topic there btw just also wanted to shout into the void about it",

We've been together for 9 years, and I have only met one member of his family. I do not consider this person he told a family member of mine. My husband greatly overstepped my boundaries and lost all trust in him. This person he told was dating his mother at the time she passed away, so in my terms of family this would be a family friend, no relation by marriage or blood. The advice I am needing is all my CPTSD stems from family situations of my own, let alone things with my spouse. I have recently started therapy again but the anger building in me is quite vengeful, and by vengeful I need to fulfill tit for tat.  My spouse, our children and I are planning to visit this so called family member for thanksgiving and I'm shutting down. I no longer want to go based on the fact that my spouse shared this with him. This was not his secret to share, and I am devastated this person now knows. I do not do well with confrontations nor am I not able to not correlate past traumatic experiences with the current situation without being told I am bringing up things again that have already been I guess resolved in their opinion. For nothing is ever resolved. Can anyone suggest how to move past this high state of aggressive vengeance and not be zen but not care. Also while writing this post, I was hassled because I am avoiding spending time with my husband and always on a device. I stood up for myself and told him I am not all that comfortable spending time with him since he shared that secret. His response was - That it really isn't a secret now is it? It isn't something I share with someone unless I am really close to them, and I haven't been really close to anyone in a long time. \n\nI also know that I am sharing some of this here, but other than a simple mention I am not going into depth or detail on what happened and some more of the context as to why it continues to be traumatizing like he did. Listen I am with you 100% that he is not healthy for me but the kids like him, at times more than me because clearly I have issues. I need coping strategies or suggestions on how to not come off as abrasive but clearly be heard unlike what is currently happening. If you made it this far I appreciate your time.

It happened at a house party and after two weeks I raised the issue with my friends because I wanted to get to the bottom of this and find out if we knew who did it to make sure that they could not hurt my friends.\n\nLong story short, we did not get very far. This isn't anybody's fault, it is just pure bad luck. Unfortunately, I ended up alienating a lot of friends due to this process because I did not handle it in a very mature way. Luckily, after a few months, they came back as if nothing happened. I've talked to them since and we now talk about it openly and maturely and they very much support me despite how I treated them. So in that sense, I'm lucky to have them.\n\nThe thing is, is that in probably the 5 months after it happened, I didn't really think about it much. It didn't have any sort of negative effect on me. The one thing I did think about was how I had treated my friends. I had failed them as we could never catch the perpetrator and as a side effect I had upset them (even if they, in the long term, do not care I had done so).\n\nIt was only around February or March of this year that I suddenly began to have nightmares which then turned into panic attacks and then flashbacks. I was scared of being physically intimate with people when this had never been an issue. I felt ambushed by something that I thought was not a problem to me.\n\nIn the summer that just passed, I moved to a brand new city, started a whole new job and got a girlfriend. This has all been very challenging for many reasons, but none of it compares to the trauma from the SA, which kept on growing and growing. \n\nI am so lucky to have the friends I have, as well as my girlfriend, both of which are incredibly understanding and supportive, even when I am not helpful to them. \n\nI've always had an incredibly privileged life. Most problems that I have had in the past I have been able to fight through by breaking them down and solving them piece by piece. I wouldn't say I've ever had any mental health problems in my life until now. I also think I am quite a resilient person, but this has broken me completely.\n\nI don't like losing. Why can't I make any progress? I don't want to be like this anymore. I'm finding my new job difficult not only because there is a lot to learn but also because in the middle of meetings and the like I will have a sudden panic attack that had no warning signs. Living in a new city was supposed to be fun as it is significantly larger than my old home, but I cannot enjoy it as for seemingly no rhyme or reason I will have a flashback. My girlfriend is truly amazing but I'm upset that I cannot be physically intimate with her, even if she insists it is not an issue to her at all. I want things to go back to the way they were and I feel like a total coward for constantly losing ground in this fight against this issue. I'm never prepared for the panic attacks, nightmares or flashbacks, and it is demoralising and frustrating. I just want to fight back and win.\n\nDoes anybody have any thoughts? Please note that this is the first time I am using Reddit to look for a subreddit of this topic and also post about it. If this breaks any rules or is in the wrong place etc, please let me know. And if anybody has been through a similar thing, I would really appreciate hearing about it from your perspective. Thank you for reading.",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone! A few years ago, I used exercise as a first-line tool for my mental health - a good gym session usually cleared my head. I had a work schedule that made working out during the day possible and I loved it. I was really in shape, went to lift/do spin 4-6x per week and it showed. Exercise was, prior to that, a tool for avoidance/escape and maladaptive coping with body image issues.\n\nBetween overuse injury, increasing demands on my schedule (and therefore cognitive functioning, I am neurodivergent), and leaving a toxic relationship, I let my exercise regimen drop. I try to get a workout or a walk in here or there, but honestly? My mind/body is so fucking exhausted that the thought of working out makes me even more tired. Simultaneously I know my body also desperately needs some strengthening. It's hard to describe, but it's like those two things are existing together and I'm not sure which would be more beneficial to attend to.\n\nI'm trying to be more consistent with at least one weekly hot girl walk and some yin yoga at home to work on releasing some of the tension and trauma energetically. That's been nice, and so have my occasional body-weight workouts, but it's not enough and I'm not sure if I should be prioritizing rest or exercise at this point. My body needs both but I don't know when to give it which things at this point. Above all, my priority is to listen to my body and also my menstrual cycle so I can feel safe in my home. üß°\n\nHow did you get into/back into exercise when your body was tired from trauma? Did you have to just rest it off? How long did resting last for you? Any of your stories/tips would be appreciated!",

I've noticed that when I make eye contact with others, I sometimes perceive a subtle laugh that they try to conceal. At times, it feels like they might be mocking me, and on other occasions, it appears as if they're expressing disgust.\n\nIn group settings, I find myself becoming particularly triggered when I observe two people exchanging glances. I can't help but sense that there's an underlying message or communication about me, although I can't quite grasp the specifics. This has led to a sense of isolation and a feeling of being out of place.\n\nThis experience is relatively new to me, as it emerged after I was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia following a major mental breakdown triggered by MDMA use. I'm also diagnosed with PTSD and hypomania.\n\nPrior to these challenges, I was in a good state of mental health, socially active, and artistically inclined. I held a fulfilling position as a technical designer, and I've been told that I am good looking.\n\nMy background : \n\nMy journey has been marked by significant hardships. I experienced childhood sexual abuse and endured physical and mental violence from my parents.For example my mother use to grap my balls until I pass out and spit in my face at the age of 4.  My father, plagued by drug addiction and anger issues, subjected me to relentless abuse from the age of four through my teenage years. Other family members were similarly abusive.\n\nWhen I was just 15, my parents got divorced, my mother left and  leaving me to care for my addicted father until he got married, and  effectively abandoning me. My mother remarried to a rich guy and saw me as a burden and embarrassment within her new social rich  circle.\n\nI have now idea how but I managed to make it to University \n( bachelor in physics) \n\nAt the age of 18, a civil war erupted in my country, i had to drop out of UNI, and I served as a paramedic, witnessing unimaginable horrors. I later embarked on a perilous asylum journey through the sea and desert that spanned two grueling months... \n\nNow, I reside in a safe country, and I've managed to overcome my addiction to weed, MDMA, and alcohol through sports, art, and learning to play the guitar. However, maintaining my job has proven to be an ongoing challenge.\n\nI apologize for the lengthy post, but I genuinely seek other perspectives.

    "selftext": "Hey guys, I'm 20M, from Australia, born with a unilateral cleft lip and palate and I feel so damn isolated from the world. It started in when I was in Prep/1st Grade. There was non-stop bullying (Name-calling, Social isolation, Physical etc.) and it would get so bad that my mother would have to drag me out of bed to get me to school or I'd even lie to my teachers pretending to be sick, so I'd get out of school. My home life wasn't any better. There was daily domestic violence, and my parents would smoke Meth, Marijuana and a bunch of other drugs in front of us when my siblings and I were little. There were constant drug dealers coming in and out of our house, we never had clean clothes or anything to eat because my parents would spend all their pension money on drugs.\n\nWhen I was 11, I got moved from my parents with my siblings to go and live with my paternal aunty who I live with until this day. The bullying kept on going on even until this day and I can't help but have a harrowing feeling of anxiety that people see me different because of the way I look.\n\nRecently, I HAD a job at McDonald's for about a year and I feel like they treated me wrong. They would always talk to me in a patronizing tone. The others would gossip about me behind my back, and I never felt welcome working there no matter how much I enjoyed working. Now I feel scared to get work worrying what others think of me.\n\nDating has been the worst thing in the world to me too. I guess I have a lack of \"love\" from the neglect I had as a child because whenever I would get to the talking stage with a girl, they would just ghost me or treat me as \"just a friend\" because they might feel pressured by their peers to not go for me because I'm not a \"normal looking human.\"\n\nFrom everything that has happened in my lifetime. I've developed chronic depression, complex post-traumatic stress disorder and severe anxiety disorder. Nowadays I just smoke weed to deal with the loneliness but don't worry, no meth or any hard drugs for me, I've seen what it does to people...\n\nTLDR: Society is making me feel like the elephant man.",

For some background, I live with endometriosis, EDS, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Depression that comes and goes, and ADHD. My brain tends toward a bit of OCD and possibly some light autism overlap regarding symptoms, as well.\nNeedless to say, my whole life I have spent finding ways to improve my mental and physical health, and I have found tons of ways to cope and help- I‚Äôve been to therapy plenty of periods of my life, I take several medications that help my symptoms. I‚Äôve learned loads through philosophy, dialectical thinking, cognitive behavioral therapy, value retraining, meditation, awareness practices, being kind to myself, recognizing my efforts. But I think I also know that a lot of the things I struggle with aren‚Äôt fixable, which can sometimes even help me lend myself some grace! \n\nBut the fact still remains and is becoming harder to ignore that, I don‚Äôt think I can support myself. No matter how hard I try and how well I‚Äôm managing, the setup of my brain just does not seem to be compatible with the expectations of society. Sure I have value as a person, and I think I have a lot to offer others when it comes to sharing insights and connection. But that doesn‚Äôt feel like enough, when that isn‚Äôt valued in the world I‚Äôm forced to live in. It doesn‚Äôt change the fact that I, as an individual, am currently unable to (and for the foreseeable future,) conform to the requirements needed to support myself. Just baseline housing, and food, insurances, medications, hygiene maintenance. I cannot consistently work and generate enough income.\n\nEveryone always says that ‚Äúyou deserve to live just by existing. You‚Äôre enough as you are, you‚Äôre allowed to be imperfect, people want you here anyway, your mind‚Äôs standards are probably unrealistically high, etc.‚Äù \n\nI don‚Äôt know how to reconcile these concepts with the brutal reality that, every single month, every single day, I have to burden others with my care, or. I don‚Äôt know, die? It sort of seems like that‚Äôs what society wants me to do. There‚Äôs no kind of support that could be applied to me, so it really comes down to just me. And that seems to match the way of the world- animals feed themselves, or die. It‚Äôs the baseline requirement of ‚Äúbeing enough,‚Äù of ‚Äúdeserving‚Äù to live. You *have* to keep yourself alive, maintain your body, maintain shelter for yourself. Or you die.\n\nI can‚Äôt live with myself forcing others to take care of my needs on top of their own. I KNOW how hard it is just to take care of oneself. Hell, it‚Äôs not even necessarily an option when my loved ones are struggling just as hard for themselves and barely making ends meet. Even if they ‚Äòloved me *while* being willing to accept that extra burden,‚Äô that doesn‚Äôt even mean that they CAN carry that extra load.\n\nIt‚Äôs even worse knowing that people you love don‚Äôt necessarily understand why you can‚Äôt take care of yourself, because both your efforts and struggles are invisible to them; Things that are easier for them might take absolutely everything I have, and then they wonder if I really am trying as hard as I can or if I‚Äôm lazy, uncaring, maybe truly less valuable as a person. \n\n\nI‚Äôm not enough. My efforts aren‚Äôt enough. It‚Äôs just plain fact. It might not even be my fault, or anyone‚Äôs fault; and there could even be a set of circumstances in which maybe I was enough, but I don‚Äôt have access to them. So the fact remains. As I am, which I cannot change, in the circumstances I was born into, which I cannot change, I am at my very best efforts am not able to do enough to justify my own continuation based on the requirements placed on me, which once more, I cannot change. \nAnd how can you feel like you deserve to live when you have such obvious evidence that you don‚Äôt deserve to? That you might have value, but it‚Äôs not the right, needed kind? That that value isn‚Äôt enough to justify your burden to others, to society, to life‚Äôs requirements. I just don‚Äôt have the power to, no matter how much I might want to, to live in this world, in this body.\n\n\nSo what the hell can I do about it?? Does anyone relate to this, does anyone have any tools to fight these feelings or this reality?? I‚Äôm trying not to give up, and just feeling the hopelessness and powerlessness creep in harder and harder the more time goes on. I need something new to try, to think, to anything, to try and learn and stay here, because these feelings are becoming unbearable. I might not have an inkling on how to start fighting it, but maybe, just maybe, someone else out there has an idea that could help me. It wouldn‚Äôt be the first time by a long shot that I thought I had run out of ways to fix my shit ass brain‚Äôs will to live, only to reach out and search and find people with some more last ditch efforts to try and stay alive.",

He was kind of strange. He really never talked after 2018 to the family again but I didn‚Äôt know why the first incident happened three days before my mom‚Äôs birthday he knocked on my door. He told me mean things about my mom that weren‚Äôt true and I was confused and didn‚Äôt care so I shut my door , about 2 to 3 hours later I‚Äôve decided I would want to clean up the house just for fun I was bored and it was in the summer my brother broke my mom‚Äòs chair because she put her empty cans after she was done drinking there. I guess it pissed him off and he broke her chair. I was confused why so I gave my mom my makeshift nightstand and I wrote a note on the nightstand it said, and I quote.(here‚Äôs this because of you‚Äôre b***h ass Son.\n\nAnd I guess he was offended because he came upstairs while I was in the kitchen mopping the floor and he told me do you mean what you say I was joking, laughing about it and he kept on repeating himself, and I was getting annoyed I said hey, why would you break our mom‚Äôs chair? That‚Äôs not cool he told me if I didn‚Äôt repeat what I wrote in the note, he would and I quote,. (punch me right here I swear to God) I have never been intimidated, by a guy before let alone by brother a grown man who is 24 I got scared and defensive. I started yelling see what are you talking about? Why did you say that when he saying that my mom started calling me on the phone mind you it was only me and my other brother who is about 20 years old and he has autism and really couldn‚Äôt ld defend me against our,older brother and my other brother didn‚Äôt know what was going on and I was scared and he told me to go in my room so I did he was talking about how If I would have said this to a guy on the street I would get punched. I was crying in my room hysterical calling my mother told her what‚Äôs happening I was so loud and I made a video because I wanted to document this just in case anything bad habits by Auntie  came back and I went out my room he told me if I didn‚Äôt go in my room, he would bodyslamming I started crying even more my mother had to leave work to figure out the situation. They had a whole argument. I have evidence of him talking, but not the whole thing it‚Äôs a short video. It‚Äôs basically that was it. I haven‚Äôt talked to him since until this night\n\nI walk down the stairs into the basement. I see him in my mothers office the lights flicker I get scared I didn‚Äôt see him. He kept on walking back-and-forth between his room upstairs in the laundry room and be my mother was joking about how he. Kind of remind me of Kanye West, because he covered his face when he walked around the house he picked up two of the vacuums and threw by the couch aggressively. I was confused because I didn‚Äôt know was going on and he turned the light off in the living room, and he was in the laundry room. I proceed to turn on the light in the living room, she told me to stop and I did it again. He proceeds to push me hard It scared me. I started crying and I was trying to get my mothers attention. She didn‚Äôt know that was going on until I told her what happened. She ran up to him and telling him how he can‚Äôt put his hands on me and I repeatedly told him to stop touching me. He proceeded to pretend to try to throw the vacuum at me and then throw something lighter at me, and then aggressively tap my shoulder, taunting me I was scared I was shaky I was crying and telling him to stop, he said I was crying like a baby mind you He‚Äôs a 24-year-old man and I‚Äôm a 16-year-old girl his little sister \nI started telling him to let me go, because at this point, he‚Äôs grabbing my arm and not letting me leave the basement, my mothers yelling at him saying she‚Äôs going to call the cops on him and to let me go and he‚Äôs not budging. My mother proceeded to leave the basement to go upstairs. It‚Äôs just me and my brother he said some mean stuff about my mom he‚Äôs telling me I have to listen to him and he starts talking about some stuff. I don‚Äôt even care about it I‚Äôm not gonna really repeat. He goes upstairs and I go upstairs and run to my room.\n\nAbout 15 minutes later, I get a knock at my  door and it‚Äôs my mother told me I have to open my door is it a police officer comes and talks to me about what happened and I just started crying IT‚ÄôSEMBARRASSING, and I‚Äôve never got questioned by a police officer before he asked me all the basic questions and he just left about an hour ago. I‚Äôm shaky I‚Äôm tired I‚Äôm scared and I have school in the morning. I can‚Äôt miss it.

I decided to still protect him when I was asked to speak to the crown judge. He had asked me to help him to take it off. He threatened that I will go down with him if I do not help. He still to this day will yell at me, even if I go to the mall with my son and he accuses me of sleeping around, giving him some STD, falsely saying that I have ‚Äúother men‚Äù, gaslights me and tells me that I am abusive to my son just coz I tell my son to turn his phone to go to bed as he has as school tomorrow. He accused me of leaving my son when clearly I did not and my son even will testify to this that I do not ever leave to go have ‚Äúsex in my car with other men.‚Äù I have gotten checked yearly and he has told me that he has probably caught something from me. I have never touched another man nor have any intentions of doing so. He has caused a lot of disturbance in my home, where police officers showed up at my home 4x. He refuses to leave even though I have asked him multiple times to do so and have yelled it out so neighbours have heard me say this. I have even written a letter to my landlord advising that I have repeatedly asked him even if the lease is solely under my name.

I don‚Äôt want him in my life at all. \n\nI thought he would become better but he really will not change. He has terrorized my life completely. He has ruined my home. He has ruined my life. I have become so depressed, anxious and suffer from severe anxiety.  I have nightmares where the person next to me is the devil. I feel like he has been possessed in some way as I no longer recognize him. I just want to leave and don‚Äôt know how to without my son. My son is adamant about staying here.",

Mainly from an autism standpoint, and the thing about (my)autism is that I learn quickly, so when my orthodox Christian parents corrected me when I was age 2-6(more or less), I was obedient, and that resulted in me not being out of line in school. In any way. See, normal kids only listen to your orders when they've heard them before. If you hear your parents say something more often, it must be important.

I was always told that I‚Äôm asking too much, and he knows what is good for me and not going along with it made me an ‚Äúimmature child‚Äù. It got to a point where I was self harming because I was so upset with myself that I couldn‚Äôt meet his expectations. \nI‚Äôm also in recovery from a drug addiction and have had multiple unsafe experiences throughout those 8 years.\n\nWhen I broke up with my ex, I came up with boundaries for what I needed in a partner, and I told myself I would not compromise or settle. Then I met my boyfriend, and he is the embodiment of what I dreamed an ideal partner would be. He is extremely attentive, respectful, funny, supportive, caring, gentle, calm, and just an overall amazing boyfriend. \n\nThe other night we were getting freaky, and we like to have music on to kind of set the mood and make it easier to communicate with each other since there is no awkward silence. He was going downtown, and I have a flashback to past trauma (this is the first time this has happened in this situation). I tried to ignore it but then I started to cry and I knew I had to tell him to stop.\nHe immediately did and consoled me.

I then ask him if he wanted me to finish him, and he looked at me like I was crazy and said ‚ÄúWHAT?! No of course not!‚Äù and gave me a kiss. \n\nIt sounds stupid to say, but it felt really special to have him be so thoughtful in that moment. \nI was really scared, and I don‚Äôt know what brought it on, but he didn‚Äôt make me feel bad for telling him to stop, or not getting him off.

    "title": "Breaking the cycle of trauma with little support",
    "selftext": "My life seems to have been a series of retraumatizations. I had an abusive childhood. My parents split when I was 3. At that time, my mother moved in with her parents and my grandfather started abusing me. My mother had insinuated that he had also been inappropriate with her, but no matter how many times I loudly objected, it was allowed to continue on and off for 16 total years until his death. \n\nMy parents' divorce was ugly. They fought over me in the worst ways. My mother remarried when I was 6 and my step dad was great at first, but around 11 or so, he started acting like he had a crush on me. He commented on my body, my skin, my breasts. He's a licensed social worker who still works in Baltimore. I was never able to speak out against him because his family is politically famous. \n\nI moved out at 18 into my biological father's home and never returned to my mom and step dad's house to stay. While my father's home was infinitely more stable than my mom and step dad's, I began dating an illegal Syrian and he attempted to marry me for a green card. When I discovered that he had gotten married to another woman because I was dragging my feet, I was devastated. During that time I was investigated by INS. I was only 19.\n\nI got into another inappropriate relationship shortly after. This one was physically abusive, but I stayed for 8.5 years, got married to him, and had a baby. When my baby was almost 2, I left that husband and got together with my current husband. During that time, I was in and out of court having a terrible divorce of my own. I had to prove the abuse and that was frustrating. My current husband watched me go through all of this. \n\nMy current husband and I got pregnant quickly and got married just after the birth of our daughter. When our kids were 4 years old and 9 months, we moved from Baltimore to Boston for a lucrative job offer my husband had gotten. \n\nThis event made our marriage miserable. I was far away from any support. I got in trouble with the court for moving without permission, which was my husband's idea. I had interpersonal problems with his family who live 90 minutes away from Boston. My husband never supported me emotionally. \n\nIn 2020, my husband and I lost our jobs and the positions were eliminated so we couldn't return to work. We worked odd jobs to make ends meet. We survived mostly on the severance.\n\nNow, both girls are in school. One is in kindergarten, the other is in 4th grade. I've been unhappy in my marriage since 2018. I tried to separate in January, but my husband told my girls that \"mommy is dating other guys\" and \"mommy kicked daddy out with nowhere to go.\"  As a product of divorce, myself, I was terrified of what these things would do to our children. \n\nAfter 4 months and no progress towards mediation, my husband forced his way back into the house, stating that had the same right to live here that I do, even though I'm the only one bringing in money. The attorney he has consulted had advised him to do this. \n\nI was helpless. I allowed him back in. Our money situation became desperate in May, and in June I opened a massage business to bring in money doing my only talent. Now, husband manages the business because he still has no job. If I try to leave, his hooks are in my business. He tells me he enjoys being a stay at home dad and does laundry, dishes, childcare, has dinner ready when I get home and manages business things so that I can focus on my performance in the office. \n\nGo figure, I'm still so unhappy. I didn't want to marry a wife. Our role reversal makes me uncomfortable. I've found that if I divorce him now, I might have to pay him so that he can survive.  He makes me feel like a terrible person for being unhappy, but he also won't let me go. I have nowhere to go other than back to Baltimore. Then, I'll have a filthy living environment, no business, no license, and equal amounts of stress. What can I do?",

I‚Äôm already trying so many things to get better and am willing to try whatever else.\n\nHere are my 2 biggest problems:\n\nNo Identity\n\n* I do not have a sense of self-identity or personality. I can‚Äôt just ‚Äúbe myself‚Äù because I have no sense of who that is. I don‚Äôt have the automatic default personality that most do. This results in zero self-confidence and feelings of inferiority. I care too much about what others think of me because I don't have an identity to be confident in. Social situations are a nightmare and I always try to morph myself into whatever personality I think the other people will like; I‚Äôm never consistently the same person. I don‚Äôt think this is multiple/dissociative identity disorder because I don‚Äôt have 2 or more distinct split identities. I don't have a single distinct identity. I hope this makes sense, please ask questions if it doesn‚Äôt.\n* Question: based on the science of how identity is formed during development, what can I do now to form an identity even though I‚Äôm past the stage of identity formation? What activities, actions, learning, exercises, etc would move me towards forming an identity?\n\nPoor communication\n\n* You know how during conversation or otherwise, when you‚Äôre talking, you more or less are able to talk without thinking about it? Words just automatically flow? I don‚Äôt have that. When someone is speaking to me, my mind is blank; when they finish, I almost never have anything to say back (If I do, I‚Äôm saying things like ‚Äúoh wow‚Äù ‚Äúthat‚Äôs cool‚Äù ‚Äúyeah‚Äù ‚Äúgreat‚Äù. Nothing with content to it). People have an innate ability to talk about anything and everything; they go back and forth about whatever the topic is at the moment and are able to switch from topic to topic with ease. Not being able to do this makes me feel like I don‚Äôt know the miscellaneous information that I‚Äôm supposed to know by now to be able to converse about most things in general. Me trying to describe something or tell a story is a nightmare. Just like with my no identity, this too results in zero self-confidence and feelings of inferiority. Even while writing all of this, my mind tells me my explanation doesn‚Äôt make sense and could be better. My point is, I do not communicate as effective as I‚Äôll need to in order to function in the real world.\n* I‚Äôve tried speech therapy and am even seeking brain scans because I feel like there‚Äôs something wrong with me preventing me from communicating correctly.\n* Question: what exercises, activities, etc can I do to get better at communication/conversation?\n\nOverlap between no self identity and communication:\n\n* I feel like having no identity and not being able to communicate effectively go hand in hand. In social situations, I think people rely on who they are as a person to dictate how they conduct themselves in public and in conversations.\n* No self-confidence in myself means no self-confidence in anything I say and vice versa. After every sentence, I‚Äôm self-conscious that what I just said was stupid, wrong, worded in a weird way, rude (if I‚Äôm trying to be playfully mean), not serious enough (if I‚Äôm trying to be serious), etc. you get the idea. I confuse myself with the wording of my sentences, so naturally I feel like everyone else thought what I just said was poorly worded.\n\nPlease ask for clarification on things or ask questions if you need to. I can give examples of poor communication or situations where I feel no identity. Whatever information you need to better help me. I was trying to keep this as short as possible so maybe more people would be willing to read it. I appreciate anyone who is willing to take the time to help.",

    "selftext": "Good day,\n\nI'm really bad with this sort of thing, so please bare with me here and don't judge me too hard please.\n\nBefore proceeding, I'll give a bit of context. I (currently 19m) started a relationship with a classmate of mine (currently 19f) 3 years ago. We weren't at all from the same social environment (she was from an abusive family, I had a close relationship with mine), but for some reason we clicked pretty quickly (we were 16 at the time). Throughout our time together, I helped her get out of the abusive household she was in and she moved in with us. Things were sailing pretty smoothly for the most part, except that she had a hard time accepting the close proximity of my family and she wanted more intimacy with me. Last year (2022) we had a disagreement about moving into our own place, which that turned sour, my friends got involved and overstepped some boundaries. She ended up getting kicked out of my house and we got a restraining order, because of a misunderstanding, which was resolved in court. We still had a 4 month period where we couldn't speak to each other. During that time she reluctantly started a new relationship slowly, after 3 months of crying, not eating, not going out and being generally depressed (she didn't think we would ever speak again, even after everything was resolved) while I was basically just waiting. After those 4 months, in January of this year, I was finally able to send her a message, we met up and caught back up with each other (explaining everything that happened during our off time and all). She confessed to still having feelings for me, which of course made me super happy, but then she explained that she really couldn't right now, because she was seeing someone else, which soured things very quickly, as you can imagine. She felt horrible for everything. She still wanted to maintain contact, because (from what I was told) the other guy was far from being serious. I became depressed though during this time and sought psychological help to get over it. I went to therapy and was put on anti-depressants. Later (in June), she was supposed to move in with him. She asked me my opinion. I said it was a bad idea, because they barely know each other (and obviously I was biased). She did it anyway and I cut contact from there. After that I pretty much got over it in my opinion and proceeded with my own things.\n\n\n\nAt the beginning of this week, I got spammed with messages late in the evening (which never happens to me), I looked to my phone and it was her, pleading with me to answer her calls and to talk to her. Suspiciously I did and she was highly emotional and explained that I was right, things were really bad with the other dude and they had literally just broke up 30 minutes prior to the call. Part of me really didn't care and another part of me, which I haven't felt for a little bit, lit up again, but only slightly. So I talked and consoled her, making sure she didn't do anything rash. She begged me to go see her the next day, I said that I would see what I could do (because I work lol). She ended up falling asleep in the call. Low and behold, the morning comes and I get a message from my boss asking me to stay home for the day (I work in tourism, so this happens from time to time). So I decided to text my now ex (19f) that I would be on my way at a certain hour. I got there and I basically just listened to her, she needed to be consoled. Nothing else happened. She asked me if I still had feelings for her and I, despite myself, said that I was open to the idea of being with her, but that it wasn't necessarily something I was looking for. Since then, she's been basically talking to me everyday.\n\n\n\nTo get to the point, I am clearly feeling myself growing attached to her again. She says that she doesn't necessarily want us to get back together and yet so far does everything to say the opposite. She already wants to go do activities and such with me. I am stuck in a hard place, because a lot of pain is resurfacing at the same time (luckily she'd also apologized for all of that VERY EXTENSIVELY, to the point where it's almost annoying). She's clearly getting over her current situation much much much quicker than with mine. She even mentioned maybe wanting to move in with me in the near future (in a year or so). She's already semi-normal after everything that just happened to her. I don't know how to proceed. I don't want to get hurt again, but I also don't want to potentially miss my opportunity to get back with someone I frankly appreciate a lot. \n\nSorry for this long rant, I hope you all have a nice day. It's my first time doing anything like this.",

He would play mind games to get sexual favours out of them, such as, ‚Äúif you do X, I‚Äôll leave your sister alone tonight‚Äù This went on for years, until my mom was finally brave enough to tell a trusted adult. \r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nI‚Äôm not sure what happens next 100%, as my mom doesn‚Äôt prefer to dwell in her past. All I know is that my mom went to court, and was alone. Her mother believed the step dad‚Äôs lies, and said my mom was just jealous of their relationship. My mom faced court alone, against her own mother and abuser. \r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nMy mom then got sent to foster care by herself. She lost contact with her twin sister and brothers until they were adults. Actually, my mom has many siblings she didn‚Äôt even know about. She discovered a new one just 3 years ago, when she was 42. Back to the story. \r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nMy mom was then used as somewhat of a nanny for the rest of her childhood. Her foster family had genetic children and made the difference between her and them very clear. My mom had to work every day, and handed her pay cheques straight to her foster parents. My mom had to babysit the kids every day, cook for them, get them ready for bed, school etc. she did everything. She couldn‚Äôt go out with friends, she couldn‚Äôt have fun. If she didn‚Äôt so what she was supposed to, she was slapped across the face. \r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nFinally, my extremely broken mother was free. Once she was an adult, she got her own apartment as quickly as possible and escaped that life. She thought that she could just start over in life, build the life she always wanted, and forget about the trauma. But it was always there, waiting to destroy her life again. \r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nIn her 20s, she met my father. He also really did a number on her. In addition to cheating on her, he made her feel like less of a person. He also personally traumatized her. On my dad‚Äôs side of the family, they‚Äôre all extremely classist. They believe that a person‚Äôs value is decided by how they were raised, and in my mom‚Äôs case, had no value whatsoever. He constantly insulted her. He called her stupid, useless, broken, made fun of her learning disabilities, etc. \r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nMy dad couldn‚Äôt face the thought of telling his own parents that he married a, ‚Äúvalueless woman‚Äù so he lied. He told his family that my mom had a normal upbringing. To prove it, he forced my mom to walk down the aisle with her step dad. Her abuser. Yes, that man in the story earlier. My mom had to walk down the aisle holding his hand or arm or whatever, holding herself together. He destroyed her special day, and her self image in the process. \r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nMy mom was determined, however, to start a perfect family and be a perfect mother. So she stayed with my dad. My sister and I were born, and she still stayed. When I was 5, they told me they were separating. I remember feeling relief instead of sadness, because they just fought all the time and I hated seeing my mom sad. \r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nThe rest of my childhood is pretty irrelevant, but basically I spent the next 8 or so years having to listen to my dad insult my mom whenever he had custody of us. He always tried so hard to be the favourite parent. Whatever my mom did, he tried to do better. He was always more lenient, more wealthy, provided better stuff etc. and he made sure to remind us of that often. (For the record, my sister and I hated this and saw through it the entire time. I‚Äôm not close with my dad) \r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nThe story gets a little fishy here and I don‚Äôt have the details to tell you exactly what happened. All I know is my mom had a new boyfriend starting from the day she left my dad. I‚Äôm confident she had to have met him before the divorce, and he probably had a lot to do with my mom feeling brave enough to leave my dad. But I can‚Äôt say for certain he has anything to with it. \r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nSo from the age of 5 onward, I had a real father figure in my life. Let‚Äôs call him V. When my mom and V got together, my mom was still in crazy overprotective mode. She blended our food in fear of us choking. (I‚Äôm not exaggerating in the slightest. Thanksgiving dinner, while everyone was sitting down to eat, my mom was taking our plates, putting them in a blender with chicken stock, and making a soup. She would then sit down and spoon feed us the slop) this was every meal for us, as my mom was determined to have the absolute perfect family. She wouldn‚Äôt take any risk. Luckily, one of the positive things V did for my mom was calm down her parenting style. Slowly but surely, my sister and I learned to feed ourselves, learned to chew food, etc. \r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nFor a short period of time, my life did actually feel perfect. We jumped around from house to house, with our home getting nicer each time. When I was 11, we finally moved into our forever home. It was a beautiful, large home on a private road, with lakefront. It was very damaged and outdated, so we spent our time there improving it. What I failed to notice at such a young age though, was V‚Äôs drinking. \r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nMy mom actually started to have an open relationship with V at this point. V travelled a lot for work and they were both lonely during these times so it made sense for them. I didn‚Äôt find out about this part of their relationship ship until I was an adult actually. So from my perspective‚Ä¶\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nI came home from school one day when I was 14, walked in my front door, and the first thing I heard was my mom‚Äôs attempt to stop crying. She was sitting at the dinner table, and invited my sister and I to come sit down and talk. She then told us that V was cheating on her. (He had violated the rules of the open relationship and started a serious romantic relationship with a woman in the area he travelled to.) of course, she didn‚Äôt tell us all this. She just said he cheated. \r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nThe next few months of my life can only be described as pure suffering for everyone involved. Previous to this event, I thought my mom was the toughest human alive. Because of what she went through, accomplished, and how she never cried. Turns out, she can cry. A lot. That‚Äôs basic and all she did for the next few months. Just curled up on the couch, listening to Sam Smith music (‚ÄúI know I‚Äôm not the only one‚Äù is ruined for all of us now) she ended up getting Bell‚Äôs palsy from the stress, and I ended up with persistent depressive disorder. My sister ended up with a messed up idea of what a relationship is, and has been in an on again off again relationship for the last 5 years. \r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nAfter a few months, and after selling all of our pets, they get back together. Then a few months after that, they split again. And again and again. Between the ages of 14-16, they broke up and got together again at least 5 times. I became the black sheep of the family, and I‚Äôm sure I personally caused my mom a lot of misery because of the way I acted at those ages. I hated V‚Äôs guts, and made that very clear. Everyone else in the family just wanted to move on and pretend nothing had happened, but I was pissed. I hated V for what he did to my mom. He wasn‚Äôt there for all the tears. I WAS. \r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nOnce, they sat us all down at the table and said, ‚Äúwhatever you want to say. Say it now. We won‚Äôt interrupt you or correct you. Just speak your mind.‚Äù I waited until last to go, as everyone just talked about positivity and hope. When it was my turn, I went all out. I told V exactly how I felt about him, in a lot of detail. I told him how pathetic I thought it was that he was an alcoholic, how sleazy it is to choose your penis over your family, etc. (I was younger then and very closed minded) It was the first time I had seen V cry. And I liked it. Of course, all of this defiance accomplished nothing except to drive a wedge between my mom and I, as I‚Äôm learning recently. They ended up staying together until November of this year, and I had absolutely nothing to do with the split. \r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nBetween the ages of 16-19 (when I moved out) I made my mom‚Äôs life a living hell. My depression only got worse over time and I was behaving terribly. I was self harming, attempting suicide, doing lots of drugs, driving while on these drugs, lying constantly, having lots of unprotected sex, starting arguments in my house, eating disorders‚Ä¶ any bad behaviour you can imagine, I was doing it. And hurting my mom in the process. I can‚Äôt tell you the amount of times my mom was crying, begging me to stop acting in this way. But I was much too mentally Ill and angry to stop. (I‚Äôm 23 now and have been mentally stable for about 2.5 years) \r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nAnyway, last November. My mom calls me over to her place and sits me down and tells me they split, for good this time. I responded with excitement, obviously. And up until last night, I thought I was observing my mom having fun. Since that time, she‚Äôs been dating casually, going to parties, trying a lot of new things (like SAFE drugs) and she seemed so happy. I was quick to tell her and everyone who would listen just how proud I am of her. I didn‚Äôt realize how much she was actually suffering, because I was too caught up in my own narrative to consider hers. \r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nLast night, my mom told me she‚Äôs getting back together with V.  Before I had a chance to respond she said, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt talk, just be happy. I have more I need to say‚Äù and so I shut up and listened. She then proceeded to tell me that, in the beginning of November, she was arguing with V. V told her that her children hate her because of the way she‚Äôs acting, and that we‚Äôre all avoiding her. (I have no idea why he would say this, my mom is my idol) my mom spit in his face and then, according to her, blacked out for 7 months. She described this as a, ‚Äúblack hole PTSD‚Äù event and this is the point of the story I need advice in. The very first thing my mom did after she blacked out was drive to the highway and attempt suicide. Apparently my younger sister stopped her. I didn‚Äôt know this until last night. \r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nShe said she remembers bits and pieces of that time, like significant events. She also remembered the way she felt. She said that she believed V, and genuinely believed that we hated her. (I actually left the country for 3.5 months during this, I‚Äôm sure that didn‚Äôt help with her delusions) she said that in response to this, she stopped loving and trusting us. For 7 months. My own mother, not loving me for 7 months. Just feeling an empty hole when she thought about me. I can‚Äôt even begin to describe the way this news felt. But it‚Äôs been years since I‚Äôve had this much emotion in my body. \r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nShe said that splitting from V was a mistake, and that everything she had ever told me about their relationship was told from her narrative. That, since July, she‚Äôs been re-thinking her part in things, and coming to terms with the way that her PTSD could have affected her relationships. To be fair, her approach was to just pretend that her childhood had never happened. I saw it as bravery, now I see it as what it is; denial. Because it worked for so long. But now it‚Äôs caught up to her and she‚Äôs suffering. Heavily. We live in a country that makes getting therapy really easy, and she is speaking to multiple specialists. \r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nLast night, she told me all this in the car on the way to a family game night at my sister‚Äôs apartment. When we got there, she said she didn‚Äôt want to talk about it any more until I meet up with her later this week. And so I spent my night trying not to think about this bombshell. When I got home, I was a mess. I had a huge mental breakdown until I fell asleep. This morning, I just feel kinda numb. \r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nI‚Äôm determined to react differently this time. Clearly, my version of reality is not exactly true. But I don‚Äôt know how to feel any other way. I know my initial reaction when I was younger is what drove a wedge between my mom and I. That‚Äôs the reason my sister knew she was suicidal and I didn‚Äôt, it‚Äôs the reason she told my sister this news a week before she told me. She had to mentally prepare to tell me, because she knows how biased and stubborn I can be. And I hate that. It really hurts. \r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nI have plans to see her again Thursday. But I‚Äôm so confused, I feel like I don‚Äôt know how to socialize with my mom. I know the obvious, just listen. But even my questions can be biased, and I don‚Äôt even understand much about PTSD, let alone this black hole she described. I want to spend this time between now and Thursday trying my best to understand what she felt, trying to understand her better as a person. So that I can be the support she needs during this time. But I think I need help. I feel so angry and hurt, and that‚Äôs the opposite of what I should be feeling in order to help my mom. It‚Äôs to hard to imagine my mom as any less strong than I‚Äôve always perceived her to be. \r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nAny advice, resources, thought processes, etc. would be appreciated. I‚Äôm autistic and really struggling to comprehend this much emotional complexity. My sister shuts herself off emotionally during times like this, so I can‚Äôt really speak to her. And can anyone explain why she stopped loving me? Not even at my darkest times have I ever loved her any less, let alone not at all. It‚Äôs confusing and painful. \r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nTLDR: my mom was sexually abused as a child, used as a live-in nanny by her foster parents, was emotionally abused by my dad, and then was cheated on by my alcoholic step father. All of her life trauma caused her to enter a, ‚Äúblack hole PTSD event‚Äù recently that lasted 7 months. Seeking help understanding what she felt, and why she stopped loving me. ",

    "selftext": "I‚Äôve never posted anything about how my personal childhood experiences have affected me, but I‚Äôm in my mid twenties (24f) now and it‚Äôs starting to hit me that i‚Äôm no exception when it comes to trauma following a person into adulthood. I wasn‚Äôt physically abused aside from a few minor instances, and most of my issues come from having a narcissistic, unmedicated bipolar mother who sorta used me as a ‚Äúlast resort‚Äù in terms of having a child that met all of her high behavioral and academic expectations. In general she was just not very kind and broke me a bit mentally. \n\nAnyways, I‚Äôve been dating my boyfriend for two years now. I love him, we‚Äôre best friends that have similar hobbies, style, and worldviews. Ofc we sometimes have arguments over stupid things. Recently, we had a minor spat and after we had a little cool down break we sat down again to talk it out and bf told me something that really put me in my place. He asked me if I remembered what he had brought up earlier about something I did that had upset him. I‚Äôm normally VERY good at remembering conversations and I tried and tried but I couldn‚Äôt remember anything. I could remember a conversation about best granola bar brands we had last week but I couldn‚Äôt remember something he had said ten minutes ago?? He told me and I suddenly could recall but he said that he wanted to test something and confirmed that generally the first time he brings up an issue, however small, I will just point blank not process it and instead bring up something small I thought he should work on and it will be like my brain never even heard it. Ofc I was appalled and apologized- I always thought that when he told me I needed to work on something I made a best effort, but I guess it was only after the second or third time he said something. \n\nI kept thinking on it and realized that when someone gave me criticism it generally sent me into a little bit of a panic. Growing up, making a single mistake in any regard could mean I was going to be screamed at, humiliated, and have everything else I worked hard on completely disregarded. I could get a 92 on a test and be grounded because I just *should* have been better, even if it was the best grade in class. I had undiagnosed ADHD as well, and struggled with losing items and tripping over my feet- the amount of times I was called useless and careless was ridiculous for someone that worked so hard to excel in everything I did. \n\nAnyways, I realized that now when I receive criticism ig my brain kind of freezes up a little. If i didn‚Äôt do everything right what does that mean for my self image? This leads to me trying to divert the issue (if it can‚Äôt be my fault surely someone else did something that made me mess up). I‚Äôm trying to work on it but the fact that it could affect the way I perceive events and recall information blew me away.",

    "selftext": "I'm trying to understand why my brain has certain issues and trying to pinpoint how certain trauma during childhood led to how i feel now im usually able to pinpoint it but not my issues with feeling super loving towards my siblings. I was in charge of watching my younger siblings constantly whether it be for my parents during the summer or even during the school year when my mom basically went to the bar everyday till 3 in the morning, i concluded that maybe i feel so numb to them and dont have much of a relationship with them because of the responsibility i had when i was younger when it came to them? But that doesnt fully make sense because i have one older sibling and i feel the same numbness towards him. I love them i know i do i just dont feel like i have the emotions towards my siblings that normal people have. I will say my dad was abusive to women, i experienced it with my stepmom when i was 10(the physical abuse went on till i was 12) but i had to get all 3 siblings back to our room cause my dad didnt care who was in his way, he would hit my stepmom regardless of whether or not she had my brother or sister in her arms. I kept them safe and looked out for them there. My other siblings at my moms house, she would come home drunk and sometimes beat us awake if we didnt do the chores, or just beat my younger brother and sister cause of how hard they were to deal with sometimes even though they were sleeping and did nothing wrong in that moment, sometimes id have to call my dad and have him come grab us and bring us to his house due to things like this. I was protective and everything when i was younger when it came to them, wasnt the most loving sister but i did love them and protect them, so why do i feel so numb towards them, why are my feelings towards them not what i think they should be? Theres so much more awful things that happened in my childhood that could have led to these feelings of numbness but i gave those few examples in hopes that maybe someone could understand a reason maybe im not seeing from those examples?

    "selftext": "Hi there. Yesterday, my husband, daughter, and I were involved in an accident where a pedestrian on an electric scooter ran a stop sign and we hit her with our truck.

The loneliness is almost unbearable and despite my efforts to get him out, he is feeling more and more depressed. He experienced the loss of a family member in the last decade and I don‚Äôt believe he ever learned to fully cope with it. He shuts down and doesn‚Äôt express his emotions. I was already worried about how to navigate this prior to yesterday‚Äôs accident but now I‚Äôm worried he‚Äôs about to spiral into a dark place.

    "selftext": "Sorry this is long, I'm apparently incapable of being brief\n\nTW mentions of self harm, suicide, mental illness, bullying/abuse, trauma responses\n\nTo be clear, I never let them know how I feel and am always being as supportive as I can. I know how it feels to be on the other end, and I love my friends, I just can't control my emotional instinct\n\nBasically I had really shitty ex-friends who bullied me while simultaneously using me as a therapist and doing some pretty intense emotional manipulation. If I wasn't up until 3am simultaneously privately DMing three people about their problems and perfectly responding with exactly what they wanted to hear, they would threaten self harm/suicide and tell me how it would all be my fault. This went on for about four to five years up until I left school at 16. I'm not saying mentally ill teenagers are inherently bad people, but these people made my life hell while also mocking my own self destructive behaviour and purposefully making it worse.\n\nI no longer talk to any of them at 20 and I've changed a lot. I've made new friends for basically the first time since school, because my experiences made me almost totally avoidant and numb. I couldn't bring myself to form any connection that wasn't surface level, and only one childhood friend managed to keep in contact with me (and our relationship is still pretty distant, though I'm working on it)\n\nI started uni and made two new friends, who I care for deeply, but one of them is very emotionally open and introspective, and it triggers the hell out of me. When he's upset or stressed or tired, he'll tell us, which is incredibly normal but I cannot fathom doing it myself. He's able to talk about himself, or start a conversation about his problems. But every time he does I get set off into this wave of rage (and deep down I know its stress and fear) and I'm worried he'll pick up on it and think it's his fault. He's got his own issues going on with guilt and he's pretty sensitive. When the anger gets too much, I get avoidant so I don't accidentally show it, or I shut down and dissociate.\n\nI've been able to have these conversations with him in the past about his feelings but my own triggers are making it really hard to not fall into my old patterns of either cutting him off or such intense people pleasing it almost kills me. I love my friends, I don't want to be back where I was feeling physically ill and having panic attacks when my phone buzzes.\n\nI don't know how common things like this are or if this is weird. I just don't want to lose more friends to my trauma. If anyone has any advice or ideas, I would really appreciate any sort of response. Thanks",

I recently got out of a toxic on and off relationship last year. For my pursuit of love, I let this person partake in their eating disorder all the while trying to be the voice of reason and suffering in silence for about many or so years.

The damage was very severe. I was highly suicidal a majority of my adult life and formed severe PTSD and have been diagnosed with Bipolar disorder in the last year but suffered for a majority of my life.\n\nThe way we reconnected is when I was 20-21 I chose to force myself to forgive him and reconnect with him out of spite to my mother for not disclosing who my biological father was. This was hard but we mended our relationship and I thought it was all gonna be great.\n\nSince then he has been everything I‚Äôve ever wanted and needed. No issues from his part and he never does anything to warrant anything less from me. Here is my dilemma. He is kind of a nomad in lifestyle and doesn‚Äôt have a solid place. Only visits for about a week every 3-4 months because he needs a rest stop before he goes to work in Alaska. Is always respectful towards my wife and I. I cannot help but find myself 50% of the time seeing him as the enemy and the monster that plagued me as a child. I find myself in survival mode. The flashbacks come back and the pain comes back. One moment I‚Äôm on my video game and one phone call from him brings everything back to my childhood and my abuser. I thought it would get easier but I feel like it‚Äôs been steady.sometimes I feel myself dreading any contact or counting the days till we see him again, some days Im so happy to have him in my life.\n\nSometimes I just wanna cut all contact and go about my life flashback and anxiety free.

Is it wrong that I want to prioritize my well-being over his feelings? Is it selfish that I may never want him inside my home? What about all the good memories we made after we reconciled, is it ok to just throw them away?

    "selftext": " \n\n# What Is [Complex Trauma?](https://www.complextrauma.org/complex-trauma/complex-trauma-what-is-it-and-how-does-it-affect-people/)\n\nUnresolved trauma can leave people feeling hopeless and ashamed. Sometimes for years. Often for decades. Occasionally, and tragically, for a lifetime.\n\nWhen the assigned diagnoses, treatments or medications keep failing to work, most people cannot help but begin to suspect that they may be incurable, that s*omething is really wrong* with them*.* Many take matters into their own hands, seeking desperate measures to feel alive, to quiet the pain, the self-loathing, and the terror, or simply to disappear.\n\nDesperate measures often bring additional complications and unwanted consequences, and are recognized by the outside world solely for the risk they entail, the irresponsibility they convey, and the destruction they bring.\n\nIn time, many come to believe that they must be to blame for how much they hurt, for how messed up their lives have become. They come to understand that the monster is real, and that it is inside of them. That it *is* them.\n\n**That** is *complex trauma*.\n\n## Defining Complex Trauma\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Never Give Up: by Youth for Youth](https://preview.redd.it/rmrq8sid8zl81.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8c3c2fa6d9a61e16a94774d45d99bb231cb5a37d)\n\nComplex Trauma is distinct from the multitude of other terms that exist to describe types of trauma exposure or manifestations of posttraumatic disturbance.\n\nComplex Trauma is defined as the exposure to multiple, often interrelated forms of traumatic experiences AND the difficulties that arise as a result of adapting to or surviving these experiences.\n\nThe adverse experiences encapsulated by Complex Trauma typically begin in early childhood, are longstanding or recurrent, and are inflicted by others. Most often they are perpetrated within a person‚Äôs formative attachment relationships. Sometimes they are compounded by patterns of risk and dysfunction afflicting generations of families. Frequently, they intersect with structural and institutional forms of violence and oppression that beset certain peoples and communities, particularly those holding minority status within a given society.\n\nThe outcomes associated with Complex Trauma span a wide range of psychiatric diagnoses and misdiagnoses, functional impairments, and evolving educational, vocational, relational and health problems.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mg19lick8zl81.jpg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=88b1a3cddc1550363e1b01d913b3066d6bab6631\n\nAs illustrated by the above graphic representation of terms used to describe trauma exposure and outcomes, Complex Trauma is the most encompassing of these terms. ¬†Importantly, it is the sole clinical construct that considers traumatic experiences and posttraumatic adaptations to be elements of a singular phenomenon.\n\n## The Brontosaurus in the Basement\n\nHistorically minimized, misunderstood, and misdiagnosed, complex trauma, if not overlooked entirely, has often been assumed to be adequately covered by pre-existing diagnoses. Consequently, in research studies and treatment settings alike, it is not uncommon for people to be assigned to as many as eight ‚Äúcomorbid‚Äù psychiatric diagnoses in attempt to account for the array of neurobiological effects and survival adaptations exhibited by youth and adults whose lives have been impacted by complex trauma.\n\n## The Complex Trauma Framework\n\nThe complex trauma framework recognizes that a survivor‚Äôs presentation *cannot be understood* in isolation, but rather must be considered in the context of that person‚Äôs tremendous effort to manage and adapt to significant life adversity.\n\n**\"****Complex trauma****\" provides a strength-based, survival driven reframe of trauma, shifting the focus from ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs wrong with you?‚Äù to ‚Äúwhat happened to you?‚Äù**¬†\n\nA complex trauma reframe takes many factors into account, including:\n\n* reexamination of an individual‚Äôs behaviors\n   * for example: aggression, self-harm, lying, giving up on oneself\n* interpersonal difficulties\n   * for example: pushing healthy and safe people away, continually repeating past mistakes in relationships\n* identity and self-image\n   * for example: self-hatred, identity confusion, fragmented sense of self\n* psychiatric diagnoses\n   * for example: eating, addictive, and attentional disorders\n\nFrom a complex trauma perspective, all of these difficulties can be viewed -- partially or completely on a case by case basis -- as **adaptive strategies to survive overwhelming experiences and prepare for ongoing threat in a hostile world**.\n\n## What the Research Tells Us\n\nIn fact, prolonged or severe exposure to interpersonal trauma-- particularly when onset begins in early life within the child‚Äôs primary caregiving relationships or living situation-- has unequivocally been established through both neuroscientific and clinical research to cause fundamental changes to:\n\n* brain development,\n* neurochemistry,\n* physiological stress response, and\n* associated alterations in identity, behavior and relationships as part of the person‚Äôs efforts to endure, escape, and make sense of these experiences.\n\nDeepening one‚Äôs understanding of complex trauma requires an appreciation of how inextricably intertwined trauma exposure and trauma adaptation are in the complex trauma construct.\n\nBeginning with the 2003 release of the National Child Traumatic Stress Network‚Äôs formative White Paper on Complex Trauma, Dr. Joseph Spinazzola and his colleagues offered the first comprehensive conceptualization of complex trauma.¬†As defined by these scholars, researchers and therapists, complex trauma is acknowledged to be a *dual problem* of both *exposure to adverse life experiences* \\-- particular those occurring in the context of primary caregiving relationships and beginning during childhood ‚Äî and *adaptation to these life experiences* in the form of immediate effects and long-term consequences.\n\nMore recently, research by Dr. Rachel Wamser-Nanney at the University of Missouri-St. Louis has been instrumental in empirically validating the concept of complex trauma, and in illuminating potential gender and ethnic differences in complex trauma exposure and outcome.\n\n# Resources:\n\n* [PTSD: The Tip of the Iceberg in Adaptation to Complex Trauma](https://www.complextrauma.org/complex-trauma/ptsd-tip-of-iceberg-in-adaptation-to-complex-trauma/)\n* [The Effects of Complex Trauma on Brain Development](https://www.complextrauma.org/complex-trauma/the-effects-of-complex-trauma-on-brain-development/)\n* [Complex Trauma Fact Sheet](http://www.complextrauma.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Complex-Trauma-Resource-8.pdf)\n* [Coping Strategies for Complex Trauma Survivors](http://www.complextrauma.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Complex-Trauma-Resource-9-Joseph-Spinazzola.pdf)\n* [Path to Recovery: Top-Down, Bottom-Up, or Through the Side Door?](https://www.complextrauma.org/complex-trauma/path-to-recovery/)",

    "title": "I watched my mother die from a traumatic injure a few nights ago, she was in agony and terrified.",
    "selftext": "**Some background info:** I live in my own home, where my parents had moved in with me for the past few years paying a small amount of rent. My mother (64 years old) was a good *200kg*, diabetic and lived a very inactive and unhealthy lifestyle, and could barely walk. My father whilst overweight, is much smaller. They slept together on a Double size bed. For the two days prior to the incident, my mother had been feeling light-headed and slept most of the day (and did not eat) the day of.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Incident:** So a few nights ago, I went to bed early around \\~8pm due to having an early shift of work the next day.\n\nAt 10:25pm (near on the dot), I awoke to an incredibly loud crashing. It was loud enough that I honestly thought someone had crashed into the house. I got a distressed call from my father in the next room shortly after.\n\nI entered the room to find my mother on the floor. They had gone to bed a few minutes before hand after watching TV, and just as my father was drifting off it appears she simply rolled off the bed.\n\nShe was extremely disoriented and actually thought she was still in bed. She was able to roll over and we saw that she had struck her face on the bedroom door (grazed bridge of nose, scrape on top left hand side of head below hairline). She eventually sat herself up, and appeared fine if a bit agitated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter a little bit of talking, we discussed calling an Ambulance. She got very agitated at this thought and said she would go to the GP in the morning. Both me and my father were a little sussed out at this, but okay... So we ask if she can get up at least and get back onto the bed. She was unable to and argued, and argued about sleeping on the floor. Nearly in tears asking us to just let her sleep. Now, I am very concerned about concussion but she just lays herself down. We leave her for a few moments just to see what is going to happen. Within probably 5 minutes, she begins to moan whilst breathing. We quickly go to see what's up and call that Ambulance. She sits back up, and they dispatch.\n\nThe moaning soon becomes much louder (she is conscious) and she begins to complain about difficulties breathing. I call the operator again to let them know it is going badly.\n\nShe becomes much more scared and panicked, complaining about the inability to breath, horrible moaning. My father is holding her up supporting her.\n\nTrying to stay calm, I whisper in his ear that we are very likely going to be doing CPR shortly.\n\nShe then goes still for a moment. We actually fear she has literally just died, so we call to her. She responds, then immediately starts making these horrible gurgling sounds (almost like a duck quacking?) and kicks frantically. She appears conscious and is absolutely terrified. We tell her to stop trying to stand, as she is struggling horribly. Then her head drops, still seems to be breathing but very shallow.\n\nI check out the front again and can see the blue lights coming around the corner for the Ambulance. I hear my father call out to me that she has stopped breathing. I jump inside, torn now as the vehicle has just pulled up - It has been about 30-40 seconds since breathing stopped. I make the decision to run out and tell the paramedics she has stopped breathing as I make the snap judgement that my elderly father and I are not going to be able to move her to a flat surface.\n\nThey rush in and find no pulse.\n\nWe quickly reposition her into the hallway outside the bedroom (took 4 of us to move her, it was a struggle and I felt her wrist break in my hand at one point, though I figured bones breaking are better than death). They get a defibrillator onto her. It doesn't even detect arrhythmia (it detected *nothing*), at this point maybe 100 - 140 seconds or so has passed since breathing stopped. The paramedics to their credit worked extremely fast.\n\nThey also called for backup to assist, and we were eventually moved to another room of the house whilst they intubated. After 30 minutes of no response, and their realisation it would be impossible to transfer her to a hospital whilst keeping her hooked up to anything, they called it.\n\nThey left us alone whilst they called the police (which is fair, as in their perspective they never saw her alive), and left us to say out goodbyes. They left her face uncovered, and I really, really wish they hadn't. Her eyes had gone bloodshot, which I presume is the result of blood pressure from asphyxiation. The intubation tube was naturally left in, strapped around her head distorting it. Combined with the pale blotchiness, it was a horrid sight.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter a police statement was taken, contractors were called and the body was removed by 3am or so.\n\nThis is getting hard to type, but long story short I just keep seeing flashbacks of her terrified last moments. Considering her weight and the fall, I am presuming she damaged her lungs/sternum/ribs. I have been fixated on researching chest trauma the last 24 hours and am assuming that she has died of Hypoxia caused by blood/gas escaping into her chest cavity slowly crushing the lungs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust watching her flail in a panic, presumably drowning or suffocating. She knew she was dying, and it just keeps coming back. One moment I am fine, the next I see it again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt all feels so surreal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo be honest, I don't even know what I am asking.\n\nI just felt I needed to type it all out, voice it in some way.\n\nSorry for the wall of text.\n\n**Edit:** Thanks for all the words, both kind and helpful.  \nFor those that may wish to know, we got a letter from the coroner today.\n\nThe Forensic Pathologist is of the opinion that her death was caused by *pulmonary thromboembolism* in association with *deep calf thrombosis*.\n\nIn human-readable terms, it would appear that a clot (or multiple) broke free from a vein in her leg and travelled up to her lungs where it caused an artery blockage. This would have had a cascading effect, and would explain her fatigue the 48 hours leading up to the event. As the lungs began to fail, this possibly caused some sort of blackout which made her fall from the bed. The entire fall essentially being a *red herring* and only a symptom, not the cause.\n\nThe long and short, is that without medical intervention she was likely going to die that night regardless. For her, the worse part was that she was awoken by the fall. She likely would have passed in her sleep that night had she not.",

Feeling it. Just‚Ä¶ nothing.\n\nI was about to quit yet another form of therapy.\n\nThen, my EMDR therapist said ‚Äúhey, I just got certified in something called brain spotting. Wanna give it a go?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúSure. What is it?‚Äù\n\nShe then held up a stick with a little ball on the end, looked like a magic wand.\n\n(This was Telehealth by the way.)\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to to move this very slowly down the screen while you think about the traumatic event we‚Äôve been working on. When you feel something, tell me when to stop.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúSomething?‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúLike what?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôll know when you feel it,‚Äù she said.\n\n‚ÄúThis is total woo woo new-age bullshit I am about to waste my hard earned money on‚Ä¶‚Äù I thought. ‚ÄúBut, to hell with it. Got nothing to lose.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúJust keep your head still and follow with your eyes,‚Äù she calmly said.\n\nShe then proceeded to move the wand down the screen. Very slowly.\n\nNothing.\n\nNothing.\n\nOkay a little something.\n\nOkay there is pressure in my head.\n\nWow, this is getting intense.\n\nMy face red, and tears forming in my eyes I struggled to finally say ‚Äúright there.‚Äù\n\nI felt it coming to the surface.\n\nShe did the same horizontally across the screen.\n\nNothing, nothing, then BAM! A new spot.\n\nAfter a couple other movements across the screen that yielded nothing, she asked which of the two previous spots felt stronger.\n\nI chose the one, where the little ball rested just below her chin.\n\nFor the next 40 minutes, in total complete silence, she held the wand in that position and I just stared at it.\n\nIt was an emotional explosion! I cried like I never had in therapy before. The event would come to the forefront of my mind and I could literally feel it ‚Äúworking it‚Äôs way forward and out!‚Äù\n\nI cried so much staring at that ball that snot was pouring out my nose as i deep weeped.\n\nMy mind started with what I felt was my top trauma, then it suddenly shifted to my brothers death - which was 5 years ago and I felt I had handled it well at the time, all things considered.\n\nBut my brain was now telling me that I hadn‚Äôt processed it yet.\n\nAnd now it was time to do that.\n\nSuddenly, I balled like a child. My subconscious showed me that I had blamed myself partly for his passing - because I wasn‚Äôt there to help him.\n\nI went from surprise, to sadness, to anger, then ‚Ä¶ self forgiveness.\n\nActual, real, self forgiveness.\n\nThere really wasn‚Äôt anything I could have done to prevent it. And suddenly, I embodied that feeling deeply.\n\nMy emotions oscillated on extremes for the entire 40 minutes. My mind was ‚Ä¶ FIXING THE BURIED!\n\nAnd all I did WAS STARE AT A BALL ON THE END OF A STICK!\n\nWhat??????\n\nMore was done in silence in 40 minutes than 4 years of talking.\n\nAnd I could just simply FEEL it working.\n\nI can‚Äôt explain it, but I was just more clear in my head afterwards. Lighter.\n\nMy therapist gently smiled and said ‚ÄúI think we found the modality that works for you.‚Äù\n\nI cried even more when she said that.\n\nBecause I knew she was right. I felt like I had reached my therapy ‚Äúhome,‚Äù at last.\n\nIt was brutal and hard- and thats how i knew it was where my healing journey was about to finally begin.\n\nI booked her for weekly visits for two months out, wiped the snot from my nose, cancelled my appointments for the rest of the day and went for a walk in the sun - my mind clear and face grinning for the first time in ages. :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n07/27/22 UPDATE:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHey all! Sorry for the delay. Going through a move to a new city but wanted to update you guys on my progress.\n\nI have to say, I‚Äôve felt ‚Ä¶ different. Better, different. Anixety is down 50-60% and depression has also subsisded to similar levels.\n\nSessions 1-4, were intense, non stop crying for long bouts. 5-7 was about 1/2 crying and ‚Äútrauma work out.‚Äù And last session was ‚Ä¶ no crying.\n\nI was shocked.\n\nSo shocked that i said ‚Äúokay, let‚Äôs try EMDR.‚Äù\n\nThat‚Äôs when I found out what I was doing ‚Äúwrong‚Äù with EMDR before and why it wasn‚Äôt working.\n\nShe moved her wand across the screen at a steady back and forth pace for up to 10 minutes. Somewhere along minute 6 or 7 I could feel the trauma coming forward, same as brain spotting (though not as intense now given my precious brain spotting sessions).\n\nIt turns out, EMDR didn‚Äôt work before because the therapists would only have me following the light or finger (or pulse pads) for at most 30 seconds. It never felt like enough time to dig deep.\n\nAnd this therapist showed me that different brains need different amounts of time to process the movement.\n\nSo now we have shifted to EMDR for a couple sessions to see what we can ‚Äúwork out‚Äù still. I won‚Äôt stop until 30 minutes of spotting or EMDR produces nothing. And I feel oh so close! Perhaps only a month or so away.\n\nBefore, I was having numerous bouts of autistic levels of ‚Äústimmings,‚Äù extreme agoraphobia where I couldn‚Äôt leave my bed for fear of, well, everything, and my brain was so pressurized with trauma, I could cry at moment on any day, and this was almost every day since the incident that catalyzed all these feelings. (I was incarcerated in another country for a crime I didn‚Äôt commit, and was treated quite horribly as a result, placed in solitary confinement with no books or outside world contact, only to be proven innocent months later, once all the damage was done).\n\nI still have anxieties, and pace the room sometimes, but it‚Äôs about 80% less than it used to be.\n\nSo I would call that a HUGE win.\n\nI know how hard it can be to find a good therapist. But honestly, while mine is amazing, this therapy kind of does the work itself, you just need to make sure you are with someone that is\n\nA) trained in it (obviously)\n\nB) one you can trust being vulnerale with when the emotions (and snot and tears) come pouring forth.\n\nIf EMDR failed in the past, just ask the therapist to do the bilateral motion longer. If the therapist gets physically tired of moving their finger back and forth, ask for the pulse pads or that they use a wand with a ball on it and to place it propped against the edge of the desk so they can swivel it like pendulum, keeping its motion consistent and not wearing out the therapist‚Äôs arm.\n\nI feel light bars might be best here, at least for me.\n\nI hope this update inspires some of you who didn‚Äôt ‚Äúfeel‚Äù EMDR working or wanted another option to talk therapy.\n\nIt does work.\n\nIt sounds so new agey. Or bogus.\n\nBut man, after years of talk therapy, this is the only thing that made me function again. It was like digging up the traumatic roots inside my brain.\n\nI hope all of you find the emotional comfort you deserve.\n\nYou are worth it.\n\nYou can get better.\n\nThe chains can be broken.\n\nHere's to getting \"you\" back and going from surviving to thriving. :)",

    "title": "Lost my boyfriend to suicide",
    "selftext": "My boyfriend committed suicide by GSWTTH less than 2 weeks ago. The 3 days leading up to it were horrific, ranging from him threatening to kill me if I called anyone, threatening to kill anyone who showed up at the door, threatening suicide by cop, debating on when and where and which gun to use, all while I tried desperately to talk him down and comfort him. He had multiple appointments coming up in the next week to address his alcoholism and mental health.\nOn that last day, he drank a 12 pack and a tall boy so he was feeling it. The night was going okay, he was playing Fall Out and I went to bed around 9pm. At some point, I noticed he was making purchases on my Amazon account with my credit card, so I shut them off. He came in the room yelling at me for shutting them off, was throwing things at me, and laid his gun across my body. I was terrified enough as it was, and gently asked him to remove his gun. He did, and instead sat down in front of me with the gun to his head. I decided to snap a quick picture, so if I did call the cops, I would have enough proof to have him taken in for help.\nThis is where things started to get hairy. He grabbed my phone to delete the picture, and we wrestled for a bit over it. I inevitably lost, as I'm smaller and weaker than him. He ran with my phone and I found his, locked myself in the bathroom and tried to quietly call 911. He kicked in the bathroom door, saw I was on the phone, I heard the gun cock and I turned away, not sure if it was going to be him or me, then I heard the shot go off. A split second survey of myself said that I was not shot, and I hoped that he had just shot the gun into the ceiling to scare me. Then I remembered I was on the phone with the 911 dispatcher who heard what happened, and was screaming for me to get myself out of the house. I calmly told him I couldn't, because I'd have to walk by him and see what did actually happen. The dispatcher said I HAD to get out. I turned and saw...some things, that 100% let me know that he had indeed shot himself in the head. I covered my face and ran.\nThe following few hours of police presence and finally being able to call my family to get me the hell out of there are a blur.\nDealing with his family, and clean up has been awful. His family blames me for many, many things. Without slamming them completely, let's just say they're not supporting of me at this time. Cost of cleanup is up to me as well.\nSo I say all that to ask, where do I seek support for my specific situation? Any online groups that could be suggested for this type of trauma and grief? I feel like I'm drowning, I feel so guilty that I couldn't save him, I think over and over again about what I could've done differently, and my brain keeps reliving it. With every photo of him that I see, my brain goes to what I saw on the floor after turning around finally. Over and over. Any help or suggestions would be great.",

    "title": "Has anyone else realised they've been through something traumatic years after it happened?",
    "selftext": "It's been a day.\n\nI've been watching a lot of sex ed content (Hannah Witton on YouTube, mostly), mostly as background noise while I play video games or do crosswords or whatever. It's a topic that I usually just find harmlessly entertaining, and I mostly watch it for the fun statistics, but one video that I was watching today touched on consent. I don't even know what it was in particular that set my mind off, but I started thinking about the one relationship I've been in where anything sexual happened.\n\nBasically, when I was 17 (5 years ago), I dated a now-out trans girl for around three months. Although she was a boyfriend to me at the time I'll be using she/her pronouns to refer to her out of respect to all the wonderful trans people I know. It's a relationship I've been embarrassed about since the anger over it ending dissipated - she asked if she ('she' - not 'we') could be polyamorous, I said no, she broke up with me saying she needed time to work on her mental health and didn't want to hurt me or some bullshit like that, I found out from our mutual friend two days later that she had broken up with me so that she could date said mutual friend. I was furious, and heartbroken since it was my first ever relationship, and I think my feelings over how it ended have always overshadowed how I should have felt about the relationship itself, specifically the sexual interactions we had.\n\nI was completely inexperienced - the only time I had even kissed anyone before her was onstage. On the second ever 'date' we went on I got two buses over to her town, thinking we were going to hang out in her house, but she just made us stay in the woods the entire time. I'm not going to go into detail of what we actually did because I don't believe that's relevant and I don't want anyone getting off on my big trauma post, but essentially she pushed me way, way too far. She would go another step further and then ask if it was okay with me, and with my rose-tinted glasses this made her seem like the most considerate person in the world, but what I had tucked away inside my mind was the fact that she would only ever ask for consent after she had started doing the thing I was uncomfortable with, and then whenever I said no, she would only stop for a second. Then I'd get an \"are you sure?\", a \"not even a little bit?\", or a \"what about here instead?\". Eventually I had to just give in and let her keep going when I really didn't want her to. I also remember constantly asking if we could go inside, where we could have privacy, but she never let us leave the woods. We dated for three months and I've never seen her house. Other times we'd be hanging out in my bedroom with my parents in the next room and I was explicitly clear about not wanting to do anything sexual, and she would still try to climb on top of me and make something happen. We even went to see a school play that my friend was in and she kept trying to kiss my neck while we were watching it, even when I told her to stop.\n\nLike I said, I think excitement at finally having a boyfriend while this was ongoing, and my anger at her when the relationship ended, both overshadowed how harmful all of this was. I've had a real fear of intimacy since then, and while I had chalked it up to lack of experience, I think it was actually due to how little she listened to me even though she pretended to have a consent-is-sexy attitude. Like she'd say \"only do what you're comfortable with!\" and then pressure me into doing all the things I wasn't comfortable with, or make me feel guilty when I wouldn't do something she wanted. She made me feel demanding for not wanting to be practically naked in public.\n\nToday was the first time I ever thought critically of all of this. I thought about how I'd react if one of my friends told me this is how their partner was treating them, and I know that I would be furious. After taking some time to process my emotions and doing some reading on consent, I know now that consent cannot be given after coercion. I guess I'm just realising how violated I felt deep inside this whole time and now that feeling has risen to the surface, and I'm pretty sure it's traumatised me without me realising it. I'm terrified of the idea of physical intimacy and I've sabotaged a few potential relationships, and I think it's because I was subconsciously afraid of the same thing happening.\n\nHas anyone ever had a realisation like this years after their traumatising experience? Something you didn't realise was harmful when it actually happened, but now you have to process all the emotions you should have been feeling back then? I feel like I can't talk to my current friends about it because they've never even heard of her, since I hate even thinking about that relationship. If it had only just happened it would feel okay to bring up, but I can hardly just say \"hey, can I talk to you about something that happened five years ago?\" without feeling like I'm just dumping my emotions onto them for no good reason. I guess I just want to know if anyone has advice for how to deal with all of these feelings that I never even realised I had.",

No ones been too keen on actually discussing my trauma in therapy, only day to day coping strategies. However some of them definitely helped and changed my life.\n\n Recently however I started an actual trauma therapy course through a local charity. Actually having my trauma validated by a professional has been so helpful to me. I'm starting to feel a weight I've been carrying to lift off me. It hasn't been pretty, I've had flashbacks and panic attacks and had plenty of days of very low function. If anything in this post resonates with people considering to do it, definitely do. I appreciate this is hard to access for many people and I urge you to research local charities.

    "selftext": "Healing trauma and reconnecting with feelings is like using someone else's shower. When you're at a new gym, a friend's place or a hotel, the showers are confusing.\n\nAfter you turn on the water, adjusting the temperature is hard. At first, the shower head spews glacier water. You make a slight adjustment, but now the water's boiling hot. You adjust tick by tick, but nothing happens. You wait for the temperature to change, but it doesn't seem to. Until it flips to straight up glacier again.\n\nBut at home? You know your own shower, how long it takes to adjust and how to turn the knobs to get the right temperature.\n\nTrauma recovery is just like that. At first, you know and feel nothing. You're missing parts of (or your entire) emotional life, but you're mostly not suffering. But as you gain awareness of feelings, they only come in extremes. \n\nLike the unfamiliar shower that only knows glacier and volcano, you might oscillate between falling madly in love and feeling eternally undesirable. It's the moments that embarrass us the most:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* You get obsessed with people you rationally know you shouldn't date, but being with them just feels so good.\n* You overshare with strangers you met at the gym one day, then totally shut down with your closest friends\n* On a good day, you'll feel like you're healed and talk about your issues in past tense. A few weeks later, you feel permanently damaged beyond all repair. \n\nAs I witness myself swing between extremes, I often wish it could just be easy. I wonder why life has to be so hard for me. \n\nBut I now realize it's a part of the journey. Fundamentally, trauma is about not wanting to feel something because it's too much to bear. \n\nBut now that you feel what you've repressed, you learn to deal with it. As your brain realizes you can deal with these feelings now, they grow more mellow. You develop healthy skills to deal with them‚Äîand eventually you find more balance.\n\nI'm in this phase now‚Äîlearning to deal with my feelings around relationships. It confronts me with the most difficult feelings I harbor.\n\nAnd I still get overwhelmed, but I notice myself becoming more aware of them and building responses that serve me. \n\nThese moments of extreme emotion (if you process them well) are part of your healing journey. Many of them become embarrassing \"I should've know better\" moments, but they're all part of the journey. You learn to deal with these feelings‚Äîand you learn how to finally deal with them in a way that serves you. \n\nAnd when you do build those healthier responses, glimpses of your authentic self emerge. You start to be more flexible, spontaneous and open. A sense of trust in yourself, others and the world blossoms. And you might not get there permanently (yet), but you're a step further. \n\nAnd as you learn to deal with these feelings, your emotions slowly become like your own shower, where you know exactly how to adjust them and get to the right intensity for you.",

My fiancee is a survivor of abuse, and to this day deals with PTSD and anxiety as a result of her experiences. She's incredibly strong, but is often triggered by scenes in movies we watch that remind her of what she went through. I can't take away the pain or what she experienced, but what I could do with the skills I have is try to build something that could help not only her, but potentially lots more people too. The app is completely free, I don't make any money from it, as that was not the point of building it. I truly just hope it can provide value to those who need it. Hopefully it can help some of you here! Thanks!\n\nhttps://www.reelcalmapp.com",

To 12yo me it seemed like a lot of work so o often forget or was lazy.\n\nOne day I woke up late for school. Got changed in a panic and in my haste stuffed my dirty undies under my mattress intending to put it away when I got home. (Yes I know that's kind of gross I was 12 it seemed logical to my half awake panicked self) \n\nWell I naturally forgot because I was a very forgetful child. Later granny found it and in a rage (I had a habit of forgetting or being too lazy to put my stuff away) made me pack my stuff and move out. My parent and I had moved in because of the recession so her home was literally my legal address at the time. It was the dark outside and it was summer meaning it was pretty late. I was crying. I didnt know where to go. So my parent and I left unsure where I would even stay that night.¬† Eventually my other set of grandparents answred the phone (they were probably asleep) and agreed to take me in. They lived 3 hours away.Tbh I had a blas with them and my cousins best summer ever no lie. \n\nBut being thrown out not knowing where I was gonna go was scary and humiliating and imo pretty much abuse. My parent was living with her as said parent is her child. So I was forced to be away from my parent (parents shared custody like 80-20 but other parent was unable to care for me long term due to their disability.)¬† It was traumatizing prior to knowing I would get to stay with my other grandparents. \n\nSo anyway the one who threw me out came by today claiming they only did it because I put my undies between the mattress and that me being 12 was no excuse. If I had been 5 they would have done the same thing! Idk why she felt the need to bring it up today. I had practically forgotten about it as we have a pretty good relationship now and shes my granny and I love her but that doesnt mean I'm gonna pretend it was okay for her to do that.\n\nI told her that was fucking disgusting reaction for an adult to have and that that is a fucking nasty attitude to be proud of.¬† I told her that is a bullshit excuse and as the fucking adult she shouldn't have acted like a fucking child.\n\nShe tried to basically say she was justified in throwing a child on the street. My family is mad that I swore today. Well no one stood up for me when i was 12 so I'm standing up for 12yo me.",

It's made me feel stuck in a limbo, giving me difficulty healing because I feel like I can't get out of the first step of denial.\n\nUntil one day when I was driving and listening to music, and I realized that if you listen to \"love songs\" (about heartbreak, or wanting someone, or doing someone wrong) you can imagine that you're speaking to your inner child, or your inner child is speaking to a parental figure / abuser. I never felt like I could connect to songs about love because I never experience romantic attraction to other people, but I found that transforming the \"romantic love\" of those songs into speaking to your inner child helps you connect to them and helps to solidify that you and your inner child are hurting. \n\nI have a difficult time crying due to this emotional disconnect, but I've found that I can while belting out these songs. It feels very therapeutic for me, and I wanted to share it on this sub just in case anyone else struggling with this would like to give it a try.

Nothing is more important than your peace - and by working on your peace through meditation your words will be kinder, making the world a better place.\n\n[Listen On Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/speaking-kindly-part-2-awareness-guided-mindfulness/id1493806566?i=1000488180576)\n\n[Listen On Google Podcasts](https://www.google.com/podcasts?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9hbmNob3IuZm0vcy8xMjNkZThlMC9wb2RjYXN0L3Jzcw==)\n\n[Listen On Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/1ozwIEgzEtHQezPoi83nVV)\n\n[Other ways to listen](https://anchor.fm/shaun-donaghy/episodes/Speaking-kindly-Part-2-Awareness---with-guided-mindfulness-meditation-ei5j87)",

    "title": "If you've tried meditation and felt like giving up because you keep having thoughts - it's normal. Give yourself a chance: be still and observe the thoughts as they arise without being swept away",
    "selftext": "If you‚Äôve tried meditation a few times then you might have become frustrated. You‚Äôre sitting quietly, enjoying the silence, enjoying the stillness and a thought about work pops up, or you remember a difficult conversation you had. You might feel like you‚Äôre somehow doing it wrong or you can‚Äôt do meditation. \n\nIt‚Äôs important to know that this is normal; noone can meditate without having thoughts. Your mind is constantly looking for things to resolve, it‚Äôs a problem-solving tool which has evolved to be on the constant lookout for danger, learn from mistakes and its very good at what it does. The challenge comes when the mind is overstimulated, over-active and is constantly processing potential dangers and trying to learn from things in the past. That fragmentation of our attention creates suffering and it‚Äôs not until we stop for moment that we realise how busy our minds actually are.\n\nAnd thats the first step - to simply observe the mind. Notice the thoughts as they arrive, not judging them, not being carried away by them, just noticing what arises. You might imagine yourself sitting on a hill, seeing each thought as a cloud passing overhead and passing over the horizon. Another way to visualise it is sitting by a river and watching leaves float past. Just as we don‚Äôt try to stop or hold onto clouds as float past, we allow our thoughts to enter our awareness and then pass through.\n\nSo if you find that you‚Äôre having a lot of thoughts while meditating and you have to bring your attention back to your breath often that doesn‚Äôt mean that you‚Äôre doing it wrong - that‚Äôs the practice. Over time, training your awareness, you tend to find the thoughts come less often, they‚Äôre less intense and they cause less suffering. You spend more time in the present moment and feel calmer and more relaxed.\n\n[Listen On Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/let-your-mind-settle-clear/id1493806566?i=1000503548104)\n\n[Listen On Google Podcasts](https://www.google.com/podcasts?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9hbmNob3IuZm0vcy8xMjNkZThlMC9wb2RjYXN0L3Jzcw==)\n\n[Listen On Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/1ozwIEgzEtHQezPoi83nVV)\n\n[Other ways to listen](https://anchor.fm/shaun-donaghy/episodes/Let-your-mind-settle--clear-eo4pr4)",

I'm between to ages of 2 and 4.\n\nIt's a point of pride for her because she felt that she had finally found a successful disciplinary method that worked for her child. Spankings and time-outs evidently didn't agree with me.\n\nI only bring this up because I'm reading a book called The Body Keeps the Score. It's extremely insightful and goes into detail on how our bodies continue to react to trauma even if, and sometimes especially if, that trauma had occurred when you were very young.\n\nI'm only reading this book and looking for signs of trauma in my past because my doc recommended it to me. Once she had ruled out that my chronic pains weren't related to any anatomical anomaly or disease, but was rather a response to an emotional trigger, she recommended this book and seeing a counselor.\n\nSorry for being long winded and a little vague about what my \"pains\" or \"triggers\" are. It's naturally a very sensitive subject. I'm mostly just trying to see if anyone has insight of that discipline methodology being trauma inducing.\n\n\n\nEdit: Thank you all for your insightful comments. They're very reassuring as I continue down this difficult path. It's so easy to just dismiss these events and continue to live repressed and unfilled. I had no idea what to expect posting here before I laid down to sleep, but I'm glad that I did.\n\nSome context regarding my upbringing:  Mom was clinically depressed and suffered severe anxiety as well. Dad's presence was inconsistent as he served in the Navy most of my childhood.\n\nMom found strength in faith while dad was absent, however, I think she became too obsessed with pushing the traditional biblical lifestyle onto me and my siblings. It was almost as if she felt compelled to do it in order to earn the approval of her peers. Her anxiety always had her insecure and worrying about these things.\n\nThat being said, I don't think there's anything wrong with having faith to get you through hard times and help you appreciate the good, but I don't think it's OK to push these extreme, and isolating, ideologies onto your children... I bet you can imagine how interesting the Satanic Panic in the 90's were for me as a kid. Oh, and Y2K.",

When I moved into my house, this picture dropped behind a cabinet and into the space between it and the wall. I I didn‚Äôt know this at the time, so was a bit of a shock when I went into this closet, and saw my face poking out from a hole that was in the wall! I digress.\n\nI‚Äôve started doing some inner child work where you write a question as the adult with your dominant hand and then wait for a response and write that with your non-dominant hand. I haven‚Äôt been getting a response from my inner child so I thought maybe having a picture would help so I went to get this. \n\nUnfortunately, this picture was very wedged, and so I had to rip it into pieces to get it out.

And each rip required its own specific and specialize piece of tape, since it ripped at odd angles. \n\nLooking at the completed picture, it‚Äôs clear that as many rips in my soul (trauma) that there has been, there has been many healing parts (pieces of tape). And some of these tears in the picture don‚Äôt line up perfectly which to me indicates that there is more mending (work) to be done.\n\nIt‚Äôs also very interesting as well that the age I am in this picture is around the age of my earliest traumatic memory. \n\nThis precious boy had no idea how hard his life would become an eye mourn for him.

    "title": "10 Warning Signs You Have a Trauma Bond Relationship",
    "selftext": " A trauma bond is any relationship scenario whereby one person is exercising an abuse of power over another, while often masking their unhealthy behaviours as love. More common than you may think, this kind of toxic bond can represent itself in many forms, and while the types of abuse involved may be unique to every relationship affected, one common denominator remains: it is an unhealthy situation and never one you should settle for.   \n \n\n## You are highly captivated by the other person\n\nSure, a magnetic attraction can be a great thing ‚Äî but when the attraction feels *so* intense and *so* compelling that you find yourself feeling overwhelmed by it, you may want to take pause. As Jones explains, ‚ÄúThis kind of attraction will often create feelings of excitement, but also anxiety.‚Äù\n\n## Expert advice:\n\n‚ÄúEnjoy the excitement of a new relationship, but take the time to really get to know the other person,‚Äù she adds. ‚ÄúTrauma bonding can feel very good at first and it can masquerade as love, but in reality, it is an unhealthy attachment that binds people together in destructive patterns.‚Äù \n\n#  Everything is moving at warp speed\n\nFools rush in. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll notice things happen fast in the relationship and you find yourself falling head over feet right away ‚Äî jumping in without much thought,‚Äù says Jones.\n\n## Expert advice:\n\nReflect on the potential root of your hurry to form a bond. ‚ÄúBe aware of your own hurts in childhood,‚Äù explains Jones. ‚ÄúWe have all been hurt and have some sort of attachment wounds. This does not mean anything is wrong with you ‚Äî you are human, and every human incurs some wounds along the way.‚Äù \n\n#  You‚Äôre feeling all the feels ‚Äî all the time\n\nFeeling a little too in your feelings lately? ‚ÄúYou may find you‚Äôre running on emotions all the time without taking a moment to really think and reflect on the relationship,‚Äù says Jones.\n\n## Expert advice:\n\n‚ÄúGo to a therapist to better understand your attachment wounds. The more aware we are of ourselves and our past hurts, the less likely we are to fall into an unconscious pattern of destructive behaviours and choices.‚Äù This isn‚Äôt exclusive to shy, introverted types, either. Explains Jones, ‚ÄúEven a high-functioning person who is unaware of their attachment wounds can fall down the rabbit hole of an abusive relationship with a malignant narcissist, and they may not even realize it‚Äôs happening. No ‚Äútype‚Äù of person is immune to the potential for a trauma bond.‚Äù \n\n# You‚Äôre on a rollercoaster ‚Äî minus the fun\n\nAs Jones explains, ‚ÄúThe relationship is filled with highs and lows, but you find yourself feeling consistently worse about who you are over time, rather than feeling better.‚Äù\n\n# Expert advice:\n\nConsider the source. ‚ÄúPay attention to your partner‚Äôs childhood and attachment wounds. Are they aware of their own hurts and patterns?‚Äù This, explains Jones, is why it is crucial to really get to know someone, including important details about their childhood and past relationships, in order to have some advance insight as to any patterns in their behaviour. Self-awareness is key on both ends, especially as it relates to our past experiences: ‚ÄúThe roots of attachment wounds are often in childhood and usually involve an insecure attachment with a loved one. This is the template of a trauma bond.‚Äù\n\n# It feels like everything is your fault\n\nThe blame game is in effect, and it seems you‚Äôre the only one playing. As Jones explains, ‚ÄúWhen your partner gets angry, you feel as if the sky is falling. You blame yourself right away and tell yourself it is your fault and you must have done something wrong to cause the issue.‚Äù\n\n## Expert advice:\n\n‚ÄúIs your partner able to take responsibility for their own behaviours?,\" Jones asks. \"If your partner is always blaming others for their problems, they may be a narcissist with no sense of self awareness.‚Äù \n\n \n\n## You lack self-confidence in the relationship\n\nThis red flag is all about recognizing just how complacent and insecure you‚Äôve become in the relationship, to the point of absorbing whatever comes your way without any pushback. ‚ÄúWhen your partner belittles, or name calls you, and you do not stand up for yourself ‚Äî this is indicative of a toxic relationship,‚Äù says Jones.\n\n## Expert advice:\n\n‚ÄúSometimes a hidden or unknown emotional wound can make someone vulnerable to being exploited by others,‚Äù Jones says. The takeaway here? Do the work to understand your own behaviours and motivations, before investing in someone who may not have your best intentions in mind. Trust your gut!\" she adds. ‚ÄúIf it feels too good to be true ‚Äî it probably is! Don‚Äôt jump straight in just because it feels good and then ignore warning signs because you want to hold onto the good times.‚Äù \n\n \n\n## You‚Äôll do anything to avoid conflict in the relationship\n\nIn an effort to keep the other person happy, how much of yourself are you giving up in the process? ‚ÄúConflict in the relationship is very stressful for you and you do whatever you can to make it stop. You give in to your partner‚Äôs wishes and suppress your own needs just to get the conflict to stop,‚Äù Jones says.\n\n## Expert advice:\n\n‚ÄúPractice saying 'no' in the relationship,\" Jones suggests. \"See how the person handles it when you draw a boundary ‚Äî are they respectful or do they disregard the boundaries you‚Äôve set?‚Äù \n\n \n\n## You keep up appearances for their benefit\n\nYou‚Äôre working overtime just to keep your partner‚Äôs name out of the mud. As Jones explains, ‚ÄúYou may find yourself minimizing and flat-out denying hurtful behaviours by your partner in order to uphold their positive image.‚Äù\n\n## Expert advice:\n\nLove yourself more and check out of the fantasy. ‚ÄúAre you projecting a wish upon someone and not seeing them for who they really are? Do a reality check on yourself and the relationship,‚Äù Jones suggests. \n\n \n\n## You think you can change them\n\nIf the success of your relationship is based on your determination to change them into a ‚Äúbetter person‚Äù ‚Äî then consider this your wake-up call. As Jones says, ‚ÄúYou mistakenly think you can change your partner with love and support. You feel your love will somehow save them and then they will finally appreciate and value you.‚Äù\n\n## Expert advice:\n\n‚ÄúA person who is unaware of their own past wounds is vulnerable and attracts narcissists like a bee to honey,\" she adds. \"You may get caught in a dynamic with a covert narcissist who initially presents like a fantasy lover and then turns out to be the devil in disguise.‚Äù Recognize your own emotional fragilities to better understand why you may be drawn to certain toxic traits in others and break the pattern. \n\n \n\n## [You‚Äôve become your own biggest critic](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BY817WX)\n\nIf talking down to yourself has become a habit, consider the source of your newfound negativity. ‚ÄúYou suddenly have a lot of negative self speak inside your head and constantly doubt you are good enough for your partner,\" Jones says.\n\n## Expert advice:\n\nNever diminish your own self-worth in a bid to please others, or you‚Äôll leave yourself open to toxic relationships. No one should have the power to validate your self-worth other than you. ‚ÄúIf someone has a pattern of having to get approval to feel love, they may find themselves in a relationship with a narcissist who will exploit their emotional vulnerability to their own advantage,\" Jones says.",

    "title": "Is nihilism a normal response to surviving a traumatic situation?",
    "selftext": "Last year I went through a sudden and upsetting situation that I would call traumatic. My husband of several years cheated on me and left me for an ex-gf. Up until then I thought we were happy and trusted him completely. My whole way of life was upended literally overnight and I was suicidal for a time before I got help.\n\nI am actually doing great now on my own. Which brings me to my title question. After going through all that and coming out okay, I question the meaning of anything. Now that I know I can survive unimaginable things, even when I think I can't, life and all of its goals have lost all meaning. Career, relationships, the point of life, etc. \n\nI can't stop thinking how easy it was to lose a husband and whole way of life. It went up in smoke within a week's time. And now I'm fine, I'm even thriving. But it really came home to me how arbitrary everything is. If you weren't doing this thing, then you'd be doing that thing. Oh, well. You'll survive, unless you don't.\n\nWe pour all this meaning into stuff that can just disappear in a second. And not just physical things but intangible things that we took for granted. Life now seems like a series of situations we endure, and sometimes it works out and sometimes it doesn't. For some people this might seem like a \"zen\" way of thinking, but for me it's very bleak. \n\nI should mention that I am not depressed or anxious, but these feelings keep disturbing me. Just had to vent.",

    "selftext": "TW: sibling sexual assault, emotional/physical abuse\n\nIt‚Äôs been 2 years since I (f, 22) disclosed to my parents that my older brother sexually assaulted me on several occasions when I was 10-14 (approx). \nThroughout my childhood, my parents were also emotionally abusive and sometimes physically forceful as my dad suffered my with mental health and my mum hasn‚Äôt had the best life either. \n\nWhen I told them about the sexual assault, they were not supportive and did not fully believe me. On numerous occasions they tried to tell me that I might have remembered things wrong but I know what happened. My mum even outright asked me if he r*ped me and when I said no, she essentially said ‚Äúwell that‚Äôs alright then‚Äù, as if as long as it‚Äôs not r*pe then it‚Äôs a normal thing for teenage boys to do. Is it normal?\n\nA year later they finally told my brother everything I said. They still won‚Äôt tell me his response as they say it‚Äôs not their place to tell me. At the moment they are trying to get me to talk with him and hear him out as to why he did what he did, but I know whatever he says won‚Äôt change how I feel. They think that I need to forgive him to be able to move on. They say he‚Äôs changed and not the same person he was 7 years ago. Can someone really change that much? He‚Äôs never even had therapy nor does he want it. \n\nThey always ask me questions about the timeline of events and ask details of what happened, which I haven‚Äôt been able to talk to anyone about fully yet - I‚Äôm too ashamed still, I still feel dirty. They also question how I was able to be around him at home for all those years before it started to really affect me (he still lives with my parents). It‚Äôs like once I‚Äôd told the first person (my gf) and having left home, all my feeligs started appearing at once and so did the flashbacks. Like I opened a floodgate. Is this normal? \n\nReally sorry this is long, just really need some advice about what to do. Am I overreacting? Being too stubborn? I feel like I have to agree and try to forgive in order to keep my family together. \n\nThank you",

I really need some help with this and I literally have no idea who to even ask so I‚Äôm really hoping that someone on here could offer me some advice. \n\nSo last night (after a few friend recommendations) my boyfriend and I sat down to watch Black Mirror. I knew it was kinda effed up from what people have said, but I was not prepared for what I saw at all. If you‚Äôre familiar with the show, you‚Äôll know that Episode 1 Season 1 involves some shit regarding a man and, to put it bluntly, fucking a pig. That‚Äôs pretty much all the detail I care to go into, so if you‚Äôre not aware then you‚Äôre more than welcome to google it. \n\nI‚Äôm normally cool with horror and gore, I‚Äôve seen all the horror movies, nothing tends to phase me much. HOWEVER. That one episode last night fucked me up so badly that I literally cannot function right now. I‚Äôm a CPTSD sufferer from trauma in my childhood but nothing sexual and I‚Äôm pretty ok these days but this show has triggered something inside of me that I can‚Äôt shake. I cannot get it out of my head no matter what I do. It‚Äôs left me with a sick hollow feeling in my stomach and I feel like throwing up constantly. I‚Äôm getting intense visual images popping up in my brain of the episode and I feel like I‚Äôm going crazy. I‚Äôm shaking and I can‚Äôt concentrate on work today. I‚Äôve literally cried and feel like I‚Äôm going to have a panic attack at any moment. \n\nI really need some advice on how to shake this feeling and return to normal again. I have a feeling that this will haunt my nightmares for ages. My own trauma from my childhood isn‚Äôt this intense and I can‚Äôt work out why I‚Äôm so badly triggered. I know I shouldn‚Äôt have watched it until the end but I honestly didn‚Äôt think it was going to happen until (spoiler alert) it did. \n\nAny advice or insight into why this has hit me so hard would be really appreciated.

    "selftext": "How do you feel when someone criticizes you? Maybe it prompts you to start beating yourself up. Nobody likes to be criticized, especially if you have perfectionist tendencies. \n\nIts important to think about the source of the criticism - it makes a huge difference whether it comes from a friend that we know cares about us or someone that might have other motivations. Whether the criticism is delivered with kindness or rudeness, listen to what they have to say. Don‚Äôt react immediately, breathe.  if you‚Äôre feeling defensive just notice and acknowledge that feeling. Its really important to take your time, so you might want to acknowledge to the person that you‚Äôve heard what they‚Äôve said and walk away. Take some time to let your mind settle before you tackle what‚Äôs going on.\n\nThe golden rule is to treat yourself with kindness, even if you think you‚Äôve made a mistake. Non-judgement is key - you don‚Äôt have to take a view of yourself or the critical person; accept that they‚Äôre feeling the way they are and that you‚Äôre feeling the way you are without judging.\n\nSo now you‚Äôve stepped away and now you‚Äôre giving some consideration to what the person has said. Ask yourself the key question - is it true? What good can I take from what I heard? And that‚Äôs up to you - if there‚Äôs genuinely nothing of value to take that's fine but there‚Äôs usually something for us to learn even if its not what the person was trying to communicate.\n\nThe last thing to bear in mind is that there‚Äôs a difference between criticism and abuse. If you are being regularly unfairly criticised in a destructive way you should know that this is not OK. If they attack you, you don‚Äôt have to justify who you are, you don‚Äôt have to explain, you don‚Äôt have to defend.But most of all you don‚Äôt have to argue. If they don‚Äôt listen, protect yourself by stepping back from the relationship - nothing is more important than your peace and your mental health. \n\n[Listen On Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/how-to-handle-criticism/id1493806566?i=1000509942706)\n\n[Listen On Google Podcasts](https://www.google.com/podcasts?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9hbmNob3IuZm0vcy8xMjNkZThlMC9wb2RjYXN0L3Jzcw==)\n\n[Listen On Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/1ozwIEgzEtHQezPoi83nVV)\n\n[Other ways to listen](https://anchor.fm/shaun-donaghy/episodes/How-to-handle-criticism-non-judgement-part-2-eqleo8)",

This is the story of Dr Len, who, it is said, cured an entire ward of criminally insane people using only Ho‚Äôoponopono. https://xmonks.com/healing-our-hearts-and-the-world-through-hooponopono/ \n\nWhen I was in my 20s I was hopelessly depressed, anxious, and I hated myself. I tried Ho‚Äôoponopono after a bad break up and some other personal tragedies had sent me to a suicide hotline for help. At first Ho‚Äôoponopono made me laugh. I would say the mantra inside my mind, and then ask myself ‚ÄúWhy are you doing this?‚Äù But I kept doing it. Next it made me cry, as I felt emotions rise that had been deep inside me. My traumatized inner child was being healed by hearing these words, and feeling these feelings, over and over: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, forgive me, thank you, I love you.‚Äù They were words I‚Äôd needed to say, and words I‚Äôd need to hear from others, so many times. After five years of doing the mantra whenever it occurred to me, I was finally rid of my self hatred. I am on my own side now. I support myself with love and forgiveness. I have not wanted to hate myself for many years since. \n\nHo‚Äôoponopono is meant to heal you and anyone you think of while doing it. My mom has a story about this. There was an angry man in a grocery store with a crying baby. This is something that really bothers my mom, who is a sensitive person. She did Ho‚Äôoponopono while trying to direct it at the angry man. He became calm, turned her way, and asked her ‚ÄúWhat are you DOING?‚Äù This was a stranger who could only see that my mom was looking in his direction. She replied to him ‚ÄúI am healing you.‚Äù He said nothing else and moved on. I have tried using Ho‚Äôoponopono on others with some success as well. \n\nEven if that story and Dr Len‚Äôs story cause you to be skeptical, you can still benefit personally from Ho‚Äôoponopono. Here‚Äôs an article on how positive affirmations affect the mind: https://thesystemsthinker.com/the-science-of-changeworking-with-not-against-our-inner-systems/\n\nI am constantly trying to share this method of healing oneself from trauma with anyone that will listen.

    "title": "Found the cause of a trauma from ten years ago, can't name it",
    "selftext": "  \n\nHey folks, as the title said, I've finally been able to pin-point something that happened a while ago. I apparently have not made peace with it and I would like help name it: Should I call it medical abuse or would rape fit the definition?\n\nHere's the story:\n\nWhen I (F) was 13 I got a boyfriend. My mom immediately brought me to the gynecologist. Had to get on the pill and all that, you know, because women must stay safe. During the consultation she said I needed to get examined. She did a Pap smear with a speculum to check if I was clean. This was extremely painful, I remember crying in pain and her pushing to get it done, pretty much telling me to shut up and take it.\n\nAt 16 I got boyfriend, tried to be intimate for the first time but that was not physically possible for me. Him even touching me made me cry in pain each and every time. I went to that same gyno, told me it was mycosis by quickly checking me down there, made me follow a 6-month treatment. Nothing changed. I went again, same shit but for a year. \n\nDuring a few years I saw a few other doctors, either telling me that \"nothing's wrong\" and \"It's normal to feel pain\", others would give me random inefficient, absolutely not good for the flora and long treatments.\n\nAt 21 I began the search again, googled, learned about vaginismus, went to a doc, told him \"I've got vaginismus\". After pretty much having to prove him I fit all the symptoms he directed me to someone more fit to help. I started healing myself. It took me about three years to get rid of it.\n\nNow at 26 I went to a gyno for medical reasons, dude tells me I have to do a pap smear since i'm over 25. And I was like \"Do you mean you can't do one before?\" Well guess what, it should not be done before 25 and surely not on a virgin. Googled it, confirmed it.\n\nA few nights ago during the night it somehow tilts (for real this time), I force myself to remember that first gyno appointment and end up in tears.\n\nIn the end her action cost me about 7 years of feeling broken and self-hatred. I did heal for the most part but it's still following me sometimes.\n\nI can't find anything on it being legal or not, but it sure as hell is not recommended.\n\nFirst off, thanks for letting me talk about this, it's a first. \n\nSecond, I'd like your help to define her actions, was it a professional mistake, medical violence or does this qualify as rape since she had authority over me?\n\nI get that she was just \"doing her job\" but ffs did she fuck me up. \n\nThanks for reading.",

    "title": "How do I broach the subject of Emotional Incest with my fiancee?",
    "selftext": "TLDR: entering couples therapy with my fiancee of 5 years, over some big intimacy issues in an otherwise happy relationship. Among other valid issues, I believe that her mother's just-shy-of overtly sexual behavior toward her as a teenager (including deep tissue massages and underage nude \"modeling\") have left a lifelong impact on my fiancee's relationship with intimacy, sex and sexuality, but to date my fiancee seems completely oblivious to it and is very close with her mom as an adult. How do I gently bring this up?\n\nHi everyone,\n\nI\\[m/32\\] have been with my fiancee \\[f/30\\] for 5 years and have been engaged for 2. She is a sweet, caring, lovely person and we get along great. I'll spare the details but sex has always been a sticking point, and although I've always *tried* to chalk it up to mismatched libidos, it clearly goes a lot further and we've recently decided to seek couple's therapy.\n\nWhen we first started seeing each other, Clara was up front about the fact that a slate of verging-on-coercive experiences with her first couple of boyfriends had left some emotional scars which make sex psychologically complicated for her. She's pretty clear that she doesn't consider herself a victim of rape, but it sounds like she lost her virginity earlier than she wanted to and it seems like in some ways that was just as bad. As a result, I have been extra mindful of communication and boundaries and for the most part our dynamic seems to work for both of us. Sex between us was pretty good for a while, until it wasn't, but that's not the point of the post.\n\nThroughout our half-decade of being a couple, Clara has also mentioned a handful of things about her relationship with her mother that I find alarming. First and most importantly, she took a series of nude photographs of Clara at around 14-15 years old. Clara mentioned this offhand, about a year after we started dating, and then quickly waived it off as \"a mother-daughter thing\" and changed the subject after I reacted in horror.\n\nFor some context: Clara's mom was a model in the 70-80s, who traveled the world as a bit of a socialite before marrying Clara's dad, and settling down in the rural pacific northwest. She's very vain by her own description. They fight frequently and whenever they do, Clara's mom sends her a slew of wild, demonstrably inaccurate accusations to her and her siblings in an attempt to get them to take her side. Their fights are extremely unpleasant to be around, they fight openly in front of their children and their children's SO's, and while I really shouldn't pick sides, I typically wonder why her dad didn't just divorce her and leave 20 years ago. I'm told that they're actually a lot better now than they were when Clara was a kid.\n\nSo back to Clara:\n\nClara's mom wanted Clara to follow in her footsteps, and so the justification for the underage nudes was that she was \"trying to prepare her for being a model.\" It is probably of some importance to mention that Clara WAS signed as model as a teenager and that she shaved her head before her 18th birthday as a way of breaking contract without, you know, legally being able to break contract yet. Clara has also mentioned regular \"deep tissue massages\" from her mom as another \"mother-daughter thing\", in which they \"mapped out her pressure points,\" which she gave as an explanation for why she herself is so good at massages. Not that I would really know anymore, given our whole intimacy issue. Haha.\n\nI didn't meet Claire until she was 25, but in the years since, I have personally watched her mom:\n\n* comment both positively and negatively on specific parts of her body\n* pester her about not being a model and cajole her into still making an attempt at being one (despite a pretty strong, albeit new, career path in medicine)\n* make a lot of frankly awkward comments about her own discomfort with the physical aspects of aging, in graphic detail\n* endlessly complain about her spouse in a way that seems like it should be directed at a peer, not a child, especially given that she seems to be actively trying to poison Clara's relationship with her dad, and:\n* drop off all kinds of weird unwanted 70s lingerie and underwear every time she visits, which Clara has never worn.\n\nI'm obviously not a trained psychologist, and all I have is Google, but I strongly suspect that this was/is emotional/covert incest. I believe that Clara's mom breached some fundamental boundaries over the course of her entire childhood/adolescence and that these breeches have resulted in some life-long issues with sexuality for her and relationship-long issues with intimacy for us. But Clara doesn't seem to see it that way: In the menagerie of sexual trauma that she has chosen to share, the production of soft-core child porn, weird touching and running commentary on her physical appearance is conspicuously absent.\n\nThis needs to come up in couple's therapy; even if it turns out that I'm wildly off-base and out of line on this one, I need to hear it from a professional so that I can work through my own resentment that I feel toward Clara's mom. But I'm not sure how to broach the subject with Clara. Do I just sit on it until our first appointment and drop it out of the blue, Jerry Springer-style? Or do I bring it up beforehand so that I'm not springing it on her and she has time to absorb and reflect? And if so, what do I say exactly so that I don't sound like I'm going on the attack? We're normally very patient and even-keeled with each other but when I even tried to bring up couple's therapy her reaction was... Intense. This clearly a sore spot and she loves her mom, and I'm sort of hoping to make it to our first appointment without another fight like that.",

    "title": "20 Fast Interventions for Panic and Dissociation",
    "selftext": "# Our fight or flight response was a gift that kept us alive while we were living in the wild. When we heard a tiger growl, we either had to fight a tiger or run away from a tiger. The first thing that happens during the fight or flight response is that our mind loses our connection to our body. If you are going to fight a tiger or run 50 miles away from one, you don't want to feel what is happening to your body. \n\n**The fight or flight system is less helpful when it is being activated by fear of social situations or by traumatic memories in our past. When our fight or flight system becomes activated and there is no one to fight and nowhere to run, we can not discharge the enormous amount of emotional energy our brains are carrying. When we become disconnected from our bodies we are not aware of the physiological responses that are accelerating the stress response.** \n\n**We do not feel our heart rate skyrocketing. We do not feel our bodies warm and start to sweat as blood moves into the small capillaries across the top level of our skin. We do not feel our muscles store tension and lock up. These physical responses, when we are not aware of them, cause us emotional distress. If we do not take steps to interrupt the stress response our minds will continue to obsess and our thoughts to race. This experience of fear, directed at a problem we cannot solve by more thinking, will make us feel powerless, the world feel unsafe, and the future feel hopeless.** \n\n**When we are experiencing trauma our brain is in such an activated state that it is not able to record memories correctly. Traumatic memories are written into the brain improperly. These memories are experienced somatically and emotionally as if they were currently happening to us every time we recall the memory.  Intellectually we may know that these events occurred in the past, but emotionally and physically we experience the sensations of the trauma in the present. Normal healthy memories we can recall as past events that we are able to think about, form new ideas about, and have new perspectives on.** \n\n**Because the traumatic memory is something that we are forced to relive every time we access it, we are not able to integrate these memories into a larger story and are stuck with the beliefs that we held about ourselves and our surroundings during the trauma.  These trauma memories or traumatic fears are ‚Äústuck‚Äù or ‚Äúblack and white‚Äù. We are not able to understand the trauma as an event that is no longer our current reality. The part of our brain that is activated during our fight or flight response is not able to tell time. The stuck memory will activate the amygdala without activating the other parts of the brain we need to think and reason. These stuck memories are the reason that we panic and dissociate. Reliving the emotions and beliefs from a past experience makes us feel powerless, as we attempt to escape from an event that is no longer taking place.** \n\n**This inability to think about the trauma without experiencing it means that we are trapped within the distressing feelings we had about ourselves during the trauma. This is why we feel powerless, hopeless, responsible, or dirty, even though the incident is no longer taking place. These negative beliefs about the self during the trauma, are often the most lasting and damaging part of the traumatic incident. Recognizing and combating being overwhelmed by the trauma belief is the first step towards pulling yourself away from the incident and back into your current surroundings and current reality. There is no one way to achieve this. However most patients find that to do it successfully requires a combination of awareness of our bodily reactions, changing our thinking, and often reconnecting to a greater transcendent or spiritual reality.** \n\n# Body\n\nüì∑üì∑\n\n1. **Choose a particular group of muscles and try to maintain awareness of them despite the panic or dissociation. Tense them as tightly as you can and then force them to relax. Stay with the experience of the muscle group trying to relax.** \n2. **Choose a food with a strong flavor like mint, chocolate, cheese, or a pickle. Hold the food on your tongue and stay mindfully aware of the sensation of taste. Notice how different parts of your tongue taste different flavors.**\n3. **Find something with a strong texture, like a soft blanket or a cool stone. Feel the item and be mindful of the experience. Try and pull yourself back into the world around you through the connection.** \n4. **Smell a strongly scented item, like peppermint oil or a scented candle. If possible choose a scent that reminds you of a pleasant place or memory. Try and reconnect with your senses and your environment by experiencing the strong smell. Notice what the smell makes you think about or feel in your body.**\n5. **Laying under an ‚Äúanxiety‚Äù blanket or weighted blanket can be a stimulating somatic experience. If you don't have one, try lying under several heavy blankets to slow your heart rate and calm down.** \n6. **Rub a mentholated lotion around the neck and chest when you notice panic starting. There are many brands like Blue Stop ‚Ñ¢ that are marketed for arthritis and muscle pain. The cooling sensation can help you reconnect with your body and slow your heart rate.** \n7. **Wrap a frozen bag of peas in a towel and put it across your forehead and eyes. This will activate the body‚Äôs natural ‚Äúdive response‚Äù.  When the head becomes colder than the rest of the body, your body thinks it is diving into deep water and will slow your heart rate and relax muscles to save oxygen.**\n\n# Mind\n\n1. **Make a mantra about the fear, negative belief, or trigger for your panic or dissociation. This should be something that reminds you that you are ok and that the belief about the trauma is not true right now. Eg. ‚ÄúI am safe, I am free‚Äù or ‚Äúmy past is not my future‚Äù or ‚ÄúI am loving, I am loved‚Äù. Repeat the mantra to yourself when you notice the distressing belief taking hold.** \n2. **Break down what you are currently doing into a series of steps, and repeat back to yourself the steps of what you are doing in a deconstructed way. Remember that you are competent and that these are easy things to do. Eg. ‚ÄúI am turning on my blinker at the intersection‚Äù or ‚ÄúI am putting peanut butter on the bread‚Äù.**\n3. **Go through your phone or a mental calendar of future events and realize that this moment is just one part of the rest of your life. Go through your schedule and realize that right now is just one minute of the next hour of the next day of the next week of the next year. Think about things that you are excited to do in the future. Think of ways you can prepare for them.** \n4. **Try and put your finger on the exact emotions that you are feeling. ‚ÄúOverwhelmed‚Äù or ‚Äúfreaked out‚Äù are not emotions. Try and specifically describe your experience. Ask yourself if your current reality necessitates this experience. Try and discover if you are feeling scared, vulnerable or angry in this moment. If so, try and figure out who or what you are directing these emotions toward.**  \n5. **The ‚Äústuck memory‚Äù of the trauma remembers the muscle groups that were tightened during the trauma. It remembers the way that you wanted to move your body's posture to protect yourself. Most importantly it remembers the way that you felt about yourself during the trauma. you may have wanted to curl up into a ball or stand up and fight. You may have thought that you were dirty, weak, small, or foolish. remind yourself that the traumatic belief you had about yourself during the trauma is not true. Also, try and move your posture into the opposite position the trauma belief makes it want to move into. Relax all muscle groups that want to tighten.**\n\n# Soul \n\n1. **Think of an object or a place that you find beautiful. Look up a picture on your phone if you have access to one. Think about what you find beautiful about this object or place. Notice all of the things that you appreciate about the beauty of this place or object. Eg. pictures of the beach or a famous painting or sculpture** \n2. **Think about someone you love and feel safe with.  Think about what it is that you love about them. Think about this person and try and cultivate compassion for them. Feel yourself move from isolation to connection, and fear to compassion. If a word or phrase jumps out at you that represents this relationship to you, then repeat it to yourself in your head. Eg. Trust, kindness, safety**\n3. **Think of your whole life like a giant web. Imagine yourself at the center and the strands of the web as your connections to others. Think of all the people that you love. Imagine where they are right now and when you will see them again. Imagine that the strings of the web run out from you to where your loved ones are in the world..** \n4. **Creativity requires us to get outside our own immediate experiences and reconnect with our resilient self. Draw a picture with anything you have, pen and napkin or toe in the dirt. Think about how you want to feel and try and express that feeling however you can. Hum a tune or sing a song if that is more appealing to you. When you feel that you are out of the immediate experience of the panic or dissociation, do a more complex creative activity that you find healing. Bake a cake, paint pictures, write a short poem, or make yourself do a small home improvement project. Reconnecting with our creative image and spatial processing part of the brain allows us to draw new connections and create new learned experience that helps us process trauma.** \n5. **Go to a space that you find calming, spiritual, or that feeds you in a personal way. Walk in the woods, sit by a lake, bird watch, attend a religious service, watch a theater piece, or go for a scenic drive. Find a space where you feel like you are calm, safe, and can start to be yourself again.**  \n6. **Try to find your center or mindful self during the experience of the panic or dissociation. Think about the essence, psyche, or soul of yourself as a person. Feel how this anxiety, panic and dissociative episode is holding you back from being present like you would like to be. Ask yourself, what in me do I need to leave behind so the rest of me can become what I want to be? Ask yourself, what enlarges what I am, and what restricts who I am? Visualize yourself taking off or moving away from the anxiety experience. Realize that it is hurting you and not helping you right now. Try and feel yourself leave some of it behind so your mindful self can become more present.** \n\nmore: [https://www.gettherapybirmingham.com/post/20-fast-interventions-for-panic-and-dissociation](https://www.gettherapybirmingham.com/post/20-fast-interventions-for-panic-and-dissociation)",

We‚Äôd got to the emotional stage of Prosecco and were both very teary. It had been a tough year for both of us. Out of nowhere he picked a fight about something that had happened 18 months before with my brother. I tried to stop the conversation and go to bed but he wouldn‚Äôt let me get away.\n\nGraphic content\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nWhile trying to defend myself verbally, he screamed in my face to shut up. Grabbed my face with his hands and pushed me to the ground. I was under the Christmas tree. I shouted at him to get away from me as he got on his knees in front of me. Told me I was drunk. Not to be so stupid. I managed to stand up to get away from him. He grabbed both of my wrists and threw me onto the sofa. Then he knelt on the floor in front of me. Said he would go and shoot my brother when he got his gun licence. Demanded I say sorry for what he had done to me. Asked him what did I have to apologise for? He stood up shouting, no one in your family can f*ing apologise.\n\nI laid there on the sofa in shock. I couldn‚Äôt move. I stared at the top of the Christmas tree. At the ornament that is my favourite that we got from Edinburgh that one time.\n\nHe had calmed down. He came back in and told me I should go to bed. I brushed my teeth and got changed and got into bed. He came and said if I find something in the morning don‚Äôt be upset. I started to shiver knowing what he meant. I went downstairs to see him in front of a load of pills. Knew he wouldn‚Äôt do it. Told him not to be so stupid and to put them away before the cat got them. I didn‚Äôt want to be responsible for him ending his own life.\nTerrified and physically hurt I went to bed, knowing I would leave the next day.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nI didn‚Äôt leave as I was in shock, still drunk and too tired to drive.\n\nHe begged me to forgive him for what he‚Äôd done. Got down on his knees a lot. He blamed it on the booze, the thing from 18 months ago that he told me he had moved on from. He said I couldn‚Äôt leave him because his family would never forgive him, and he would die alone.\n\nI stayed. I stayed for 3 days and tried to act normal and put it behind me. Put plans in place to go t-total but he kept finding reasons to have a drink in the future ‚Äì birthdays etc. Said he would make it up with my brother (I thought he already had) and make a real effort with my family. I asked him when and he said he wouldn‚Äôt bother if I wasn‚Äôt going to forgive him. He asked if we could forget it ever happened and I said no. He tried to act normal and make plans for the future. That was when I crumbled. I knew there was no future with him where I would be happy. I messaged my mum to come and get me, told him I needed space and time away from him. Told him 2 weeks later I wasn‚Äôt coming home, and it was over.\n\nHe told me I‚Äôd tripped, I was overreacting, we should go to counselling and try to fix it. I told him we weren‚Äôt broken, he was broken. And I didn‚Äôt want to be married to him anymore. Said I couldn‚Äôt divorce him without his agreement, but I knew that wasn‚Äôt true. He quickly moved on to me collecting my stuff and him wanting to keep the house. Petulant child he is.\n\nFiling for a no-fault divorce. It cannot be contested and is purely paperwork. I will never forgive him for what he did. The one person in your life who should never treat you that way.\n\nSo I‚Äôm at the start of my journey and I am grieving alongside my trauma. I am also trying to find things to stop this from developing into PTSD and affecting my future. I do not want the man he became and what he did to me to define my future. I am doing lots of things I didn‚Äôt think I would do this year. Some of them will be good and some will be bad.\n\nI have already found this article to help me and I thought I would share with you all:\nhttps://adaa.org/learn-from-us/from-the-experts/blog-posts/consumer/how-prevent-trauma-becoming-ptsd#:~:text=The%20main%20difference%20between%20PTSD,re%2Dexperiencing%20the%20traumatic%20event.\n\nresiliency and recovery following traumatic events identified the following as protective factors for developing PTSD, meaning those who engaged in these did not endure longer-term suffering:\nContinuous contact with and support from important people in your life\nDisclosing the trauma to loved ones\nIdentifying as a survivor as opposed to a victim\nUse of positive emotion and laughter\nFinding positive meaning in the trauma\nHelping others in their healing process\nHolding the belief that you can manage your feelings and cope\n \nAnd while this is heart breaking, I recognise I was unhappy the last few years. Things had happened that made it difficult to be a couple and I didn‚Äôt want to be around him. He had changed into someone I didn‚Äôt like. This is not how I would have wanted this to end, but I know that this separation and divorce will be the best for both of us in the long run.",

Long story‚Ä¶. \n\nHe had a gun to his head and was screaming and crying to not come home and that he didn‚Äôt want me to see.

Food was sometimes scarce, and we were always required to eat everything on our plates to not waste food.

I buy in bulk or buy way too much. I've become mildly obsessed with filling, but not thoroughly using, my pantry. I'm no doomsday prepper, but it does make me feel irrationally safe and  I don't like depleting my \"resources\" that much. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- I am scared to death of making a dentist appointment, even though I now have great insurance through my husband.

I can spend money on other people all day long, but always talk myself out of caring for myself as I should.

This can be bad for our wellbeing though, particularly as the algorithm that controls our news feed is designed to provoke a reaction from us. Emotions like fear and anger are a lot more likely to grab people‚Äôs attention than happiness, so the content that we get fed through tends to water the seeds of anxiety and resentment.   \n\nWe can notice how much time we‚Äôre depending on the news and social media and limit ourselves, setting a regular alarm on our phone (the Plum Village app is good for this). When it goes off, if you‚Äôre watching the news or on social media, just stop, breath, notice your thoughts, notice what you‚Äôre feeling. With more awareness, you can make informed decisions about the media you consume and decide for yourself when to stop. \n\nBut the evidence shows that with the news and social media, less is more. You can get a summary of whats going on once or twice a day - with the time you save you can call up a friend, go for a walk, enjoy nature.

    "title": "Trauma from my family's reactions to an incident more than from the actual incident. [Trigger Warning: attempted sexual assault]",
    "selftext": "Ten years ago I was 17. It was late August and I was at a family party when my Aunt K asked if I'd like to come stay over her house for a few nights to hang out with the kids (four kids ages 4-12). I was happy to. I had been trying for all of my teen years to reconnect with my father's family because he stopped talking to them from the time I was 7 til about age 13. I always felt like I was on the outside looking in, but that for the year or so prior that I had been accepted back in. I hadn't done anything wrong to not be accepted, it was my parents, but still I felt like I had to prove myself and was happy to think I finally had. \n\nSo I went home with my aunt and the kids. That night, my Uncle P (Aunt K's husband) was talking to me and offered me a drink. Just a twisted tea, I believe. He was asking me about my low self esteem and about my recent break up with an abusive ex. He kept pushing me to talk. He gave me more alcohol, eventually giving me harder liquor and telling me it was fine since I was with him and not driving or anything.\n\nI remember going to another room and coming back in, he commented how my boobs were so large he could see them before he saw me appear from the other room. Then we sat outside with his daughter (11 at the time). He was still asking me about why my self esteem was so low when I was so pretty. When I excused myself to use the bathroom, he commented that I could go along the side of the house where it was dark and he could come \"help me\" pee. Not offering help like because it was dark, but with a smirk and a crass tone like he wanted to help me get my pants off.\n\nI went to bed in a small guest room in the basement. Aunt K was playing Farmville on the computer down there. At some point when she took a break from that and wasn't around, Uncle P came down and opened my door. He was in only his underwear and told me to scoot over and let him in the bed. I panicked and began to scream at him no and to get out. My aunt came in and began to scream at him, and they went upstairs to fight. I stayed in the room, scared I had caused their fighting and wondering what would have happened if I hadn't screamed or if my aunt hadn't come in. I was scared that whole night, afraid to sleep. I wondered if he would try to come back. I was so scared and anxious I couldn't even pee despite having to badly.\n\nI went home the next day. My aunt didn't talk about it, it was like it never happened. She drove me home. After a few hours at home I told my mom, and told a close family friend a few days later. Then I tried to forget. I started using painkillers for a few months after that to try and ignore the memory of it. It wasn't until December when things got bad.\n\nIn an emotional, hungover state (day after my 18th birthday party) I finally confided in my dad about it. I told him not to say anything and he said he wouldn't, though I should have known then he couldn't keep his word. Later I got a call from my mom that my dad was heading up to kill my uncle, or to just beat him up and try to get him in trouble with his job. I got calls from my aunt and my grandmother that it was all my fault. They both said I was drinking that night so I must have misremembered. They said I shouldn't have said anything to anyone even if something did occur. \n\nMy aunt doesn't seem to be in love with her husband, but he makes a lot of money so she stays. Even after a lot of drunken abuse and even brandishing a gun at her and the kids with threats to kill them all, she stays. So she called me a liar, fearing her husband losing his job. My grandmother told me later that she knew I was telling the truth, but that she called me a liar at the time so she wouldn't lose my four cousins. We had lost a cousin a few years earlier, so my grandma didn't want four more of her grandkids to be kept from her.\n\nThat's one of the things that still traumatizes me. That I was sacrificed for them. That I was the expendable one. That I was the victim and my credibility, my reputation in the family, my feelings of self worth.... so much was expendable to them. It shows me how I didn't matter. Worsening my trauma didn't matter. To them, my truth was inconvenient, and I was at fault for speaking up.\n\nIt was just days before Christmas and my relatives were saying how since I was apparently a drunk and a liar I shouldn't be invited to the big family Christmas Eve party that year (a big deal in my family, and I had even helped with decorating and wrapping gifts for my grandparents). They would rather have him there than me. After that Christmas, I was invited to things again, but it was never supposed to come up again.\n\nMy trauma from how my family reacted is much bigger than any trauma I have from the incident itself. I would shake and become irritable for days before seeing my family members. I still do. Even this year before a picnic for another cousin's birthday I was a teary, shaky mess for days reliving the ostracization and lack of support from ten years ago. \n\nI've been told to be polite and say hello to my aunt and uncle at family gatherings since. My family all act like it never happened and that they never hurt me. When I've brought it up to any of them to discuss how I feel I'm told \"Well nothing happened so why do you have to bring it up?\" So I don't bring it up anymore, and it festers inside of me. My boyfriend has asked me why I still bother with them after all they did to me. And honestly, I'm not even sure why. I wanted for so long to be accepted by them, and it's hard to swallow that I never really will be.\n\nI feel guilty even though I know I shouldn't. I know I didn't do anything wrong. But they made me feel like I did. By accepting the drinks, by having large breasts (under a very modest t-shirt that to this day I can't look at without memories of this), by telling anyone.....\n\nHow do I stop feeling this pain, guilt, and anger? How do I get over being so expendable to people I wanted so badly to love me? How do I justify my trauma when it wasn't nearly as traumatic as what many others have been through?\n\nI need help. This pain has been locked inside me for too long and I can't live with it eating me up inside several times a year. It ruins moments I should enjoy. It taints good memories. It has ruined my relationship with my family, though I'm a fool for ever trying to salvage it.\n\nI'm sorry to ask for help for something that is so small compared to the actual sexual assaults people have been through. But I still feel like something was taken from me that night in my aunt's basement. My trust, my innocence, my family..... If only he understood what his drunken impropriety cost me. If only any of them understood or even cared to...",

    "selftext": "Mindfulness is all about applying 100% of your attention to whatever you‚Äôre doing. Of course this can be sitting down for a  guided meditation, focusing on our breath, or words/images, or your body. Doing a little of that kind of formal practice each day is the best way to see the full benefits of mindfulness but sometimes when we've got a lot on it can be hard to stay in a routine.\n\nIt's worth bearing in mind that the other way to develop your practice is simply being present in your everyday life. Its good to have things that you do regularly that can remind you to focus your awareness, sometimes called a bell of mindfulness. Examples of these are brushing your teeth in the morning, or walking to the kitchen to make a cup of tea. It can be as simple as something you see - everytime your take your phone out to take a look at it you can stop, focus on your inbreath, then focus on your outbreath. Returning to your breath several times a day helps to ground you in the present moment and reduce stress.\n\nFor me, the challenge is eating mindfully. I have a habit of mindlessly shoveling my lunch into my face and the hungrier I am the less mindful I become. But it's a really nice practice for the first few mouthfuls to take your time and fully experience what you‚Äôre consuming, what it looks like, smells like, the texture, the flavours. Eating slowly and mindfully in this way means we enjoy what we eat, we‚Äôre grateful for what we have and we appreciate what went into its creation. I find that it makes meals more filling as well so I tend to snack less afterwards.\n\nOf course it's worth remembering the old adage \"You should sit in meditation for 20 minutes a day. Unless you're too busy, then you should sit for an hour.\" Nothing is more important than your peace, so prioritise taking some time to be still when things are hectic. But making a bit of stillness part of your everyday life can a big difference.\n\n[Listen On Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/too-busy-for-mindfulness/id1493806566?i=1000507099351)\n\n[Listen On Google Podcasts](https://www.google.com/podcasts?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9hbmNob3IuZm0vcy8xMjNkZThlMC9wb2RjYXN0L3Jzcw==)\n\n[Listen On Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/1ozwIEgzEtHQezPoi83nVV)\n\n[Other ways to listen](https://anchor.fm/shaun-donaghy/episodes/Too-busy-for-mindfulness--Try-this-eplk25)",

    "selftext": " I'm a brother to only sisters so in my home life I was always showered in love. I was and to this day am seen as their \"cute little brother\" even though I'm in my 20s. My sisters would do anything for me and we have a great relationship.¬†Outside of the home, I grew up incredibly rough. Horrible neighborhoods, violent schools, and just an overall violent life. I never realized how violent my upbringing was until I was in college and we were telling funny high school stories. All my stories got a wild reaction. It was always the most traumatic thing anyone has ever heard. But to me it's just a Tuesday. What do you mean you didn't see a dead body in the snow while walking to school? You mean you've never had a gun pointed at you? Were my usual responses. I wasn't trying to sound tough or cool. It's just what I was used to. I never thought I internalized it much and never realized how much it affected me.¬†\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI always thought the way I grew up was great. I have little to no emotional reactions to things. I feel emotion, I'm not a robot. But I can just choose to not feel them like a switch. You could walk in the room and tell me my best friend got killed and I would just be like \"okay\" and carry on. I recently lost a childhood friend and heard the news while at work. Just said \"wow\" and kept working. I went to the funeral and I cried there. But only there. Never on my own or out of nowhere. I allowed myself that one day to mourn.¬†I have complete control over my emotions and actions. I used to see this as an advantage. My ego is pretty big and I'm a very confident, charismatic, and charming kind of guy. What inflated my ego even more was how everyone in comparison to me and my close friends were so soft. Just the menial things the average person complains about that I don't care about. Someone said something bad about you and it ruined your day? Your alive, be happy. Little stuff has never bothered me. If I am alive at the end of each day it's a good day to me. I thought it'd be dead by 21 so anything after is just extra dlc in my eyes. I now realize that to these are trauma responses and it's perfectly okay to let non life threatening things bother you. They don't bother me because my tolerance is high but I don't view people as \"soft\" anymore.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDue to the life I've lead. I've never had a relationship ever. For many reasons. It took a long time for me to get to these thoughts. All these conclusions are years of painful therapy-less introspection built up. I realized that I'm demi sexual. Meaning I do not want someone unless I fully trust and have a connection with them. But because of how I am. I have never formed a connection with anyone in that way or even trusted someone. The idea of even holding someone's hand makes my skin crawl. Sharing a bed, cuddling, someone knowing personal information and later being able to use it against you when they're mad. That's something I can't sign up for. It goes against every survival instinct in my body.¬†That's not to say I haven't had chances. I don't think I'm attractive but I have a big personality, I'm funny, confident, and charismatic. Lots of girls have asked me out or tried to start something with me. But it just feels like a trap in my head. Over the last I'd say two years I've been a lot more relaxed. I've formed deep friendships that aren't based on \"we survived together.\" I've let people in on my fears and dreams. I've had real conversation and formed close bonds. It took a lot of work but a female friend brought it out of me. But even after letting my guard down I still feel like this isn't right be intimate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhich led me to another realization that really hit me in the ego. I don't think I'm worthy of love. I don't think I'm lovable. I think I excel at everything else. I'm a great ride or die friend. But just romantic love. I don't think I'm worthy of that. That was a hard realization. I'm just the close friend that will always fight for my friends and even die for them so why am I not worthy of love? I would always befriend people different than me. \"Softer\" people. I guess I was inadvertently looking for a light in my life but a couple days ago I realized that I am a light as well. Because I'm demi sexual and dead any romantic feelings before they start. I haven't had many crushes on my life. One strong one and one small one. Both of them I never did anything with because they were \"good girls\" and I was me. Along with my trust issues and all that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt just really hit me one night. I was in bed and the thought just appeared in my mind. \"I am lovable.\" Not gonna lie it almost made me cry. For the first time in my life I really love myself. I've always liked myself but now I love myself even if I am very flawed and rough. Do I plan on jumping into a relationship? No, but it's nice knowing that if the opportunity arises I can. I can be love and I can be loved. I've grown a lot these last 4 or 5 years I have to thank my friend who has always been there and grown with me. We're both just as rough and we're both learning to adapt to normal civilian life.I have to thank new friends. Even the bad experiences with friends. I had a really close friend that just randomly ghosted us. She moved and just stopped replying to us. We used to hang out every day and I would be at her house. One of the most painful experiences ever but I'm glad I went through it. Before that I'd only been through situations where life and death was on the line. I was always so afraid of my feelings getting hurt and going through that and learning that I can be okay after that was needed lesson. My close female friend who seems to have been slowly chipping at my exterior and getting to the root of the reason I am this way. I've been building up her confidence and she's been learning how to toughen up because of me. She is one of the main reasons I feel like I can be a light in someone's life and worthy of love.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry if there is typos. Doing this on mobile before I go to sleep¬†",

    "title": "Trauma has made feeling loved into a horrifying experience for me",
    "selftext": "TW: mentions of SA at young ages.\n\nSo, feeling like someone loves and cares for me is terrifying to me. The fact that I now have people around me who will love and care for me no matter what makes me so viscerally uncomfortable and I don't know what to do to reframe my reactions. My friend simply telling me that they are proud of me or happy for me makes me feel so gross and shameful and afraid of feeling it. The fact that my partner (even saying that makes me uncomfy) saying that they love me and not being disgusted, shamed, or grossed out by me is so foreign that I don't know how to function and I shut down and get scared.\n\nMy childhood has never been good in the first place, my mother never loved me as I am, my father abandoned me yet still tries to be in my life to avoid child support, and my family (mother, grandmother, aunt) kept trying to change me into their ideal version of me, beating me down every moment I try to be myself. They'd pretend to be nice to me to get whatever they want from me, they would insult me one minute, then ask as a child for advice on their adult situations. Even when it came to strangers and school friends, they'd all pretend to like me in order to get what they want from me and then proceed to use me and abandon me. My boundaries were never respected, my close family and even distant family always touching me inappropriately (including my father) out in the open and me getting in trouble for reacting to it. My mother forcing me to apologize to her husband after he choked me as a early teen over a measuring cup. Being forced to have certain reactions to things and do certain things in order to not be on someone's radar. Even in my dating history which unsurprisingly has mirrored my home life, consisted of men (even familial) only wanting me for my body and what I can give to them, pretending that they love and care for me meanwhile siphoning me of my virtue and resources and leaving once I stop putting out. \n\nMy problem is not being scared that no one loves me, or being scared that my friends and partner don't love me, my problem is the fact that they do. My problem is they fact that they care about me and would go to great lengths to keep me safe, they respect my boundaries and want the best for me and enjoy spending time with me. I should feel happy and safe in that situation but I can't help but feel like I'm not safe even though I am. The fact that my partner undoubtedly loves me and is ready to spend the rest of forever with me terrifies me- it's like my body is waiting for the other foot to drop. Even though I have a deep inner knowing that they won't- the knee jerk trauma reaction to want to run and hide from anything good but dive into everything bad is fucking me up. \n\nI caught myself many times wishing that they'd be mean to me, wishing that my partner would degrade me and just use me, because that is what I know to be love and I know it's wrong but I don't know how to fix the thought that love does not need to be painful. I don't want to be hurt again, I want to be happy and experience that love and allow myself to feel safe but my dumb lizard brain and lizard body are like \"hEheERhE HoW dO We KnOW tHeY LoVE uS if THeY ArEnt HUrTiNG US\". I find myself being literally repulsed by genuine acts of affection. Seeing a couple be coupley on tv, i have to look away out of discomfort, reading a story and two characters share a genuine loving connection, I have to skip over that part out of discomfort. I only know how to show my love and my care to others by being used, and that not being the way that my friends and partner treat me makes me uncomfy. \n\nI don't want to be this way, I want to do better and be better but I find it so hard because I can't afford therapy directly and trying to figure out what I'm feeling, why, and how to fix it has been treacherous. I see people saying its a phobia but I know for me it's not a phobia, nor is it an attachment style, rather a trauma response but thats the extent of it. I want to get older, get married, have kids and be a better parent than my parents but I can't expect to do that if I can't allow myself to be a healthy representation of what love is- if I can't allow myself to feel love, to even accept compliments. I can barely handle physical touch because every single touch I've felt so far has had malice and malintent attached to it. I don't know what to do, and I feel like all I'm doing is being ungrateful for having a healthy friend group while simultaneously I feel like I'm boasting about it and pulling a \"woe is me everything is good and I'm unhappy\" even though I know it's way more than that. \n\nTLDR; everyone in my life up until now has made me feel so unsafe through means of pretending to be a safe place for me, only to end up being an abusive hotspot. And now that I have a healthy set of friends and partner, them being genuinely nice and caring towards me freaks me out and causes me to be uncomfortable and wish for them to also be abusive hotspots because that is all I know and what has made me safe and has shaped my idea of love and that love must be painful.

No one around me knows except a few people. Neither of them like hearing about it or talking about it. They change the topic or act awkward. I don't want to make them uncomfortable so we never talk about it. My ex boyfriend knows too but he hated hearing about it as well and didn't take me seriously. I decided not to tell people after that because nobody wants to hear it. Usually I'm completely fine with this, in fact it's better this way because they don't treat me any different. But sometimes I get very lonely and upset and I often can't sleep. I try my best to power through but it doesn't always work. Every single website or resource I've seen always says that the only way to get over it is to talk it out or find someone to love you and give you care. But none of those options are available to me as of now. My parents only come home rarely (about once every two weeks) so I'm usually by myself, and I don't have any other close friends to confide in even if that was an option. All of those websites make it seem like it's impossible to get better unless you have other people. I don't have other people. Are there any methods to getting over it alone? Or is it even possible?\n\nThank you for reading",

I was 5 fucking years old.  Innocent and free playing in my back yard.  My father was in his shed where I was out of his vision,  it was summer I had on my bathing suit. I was 5 and having a blast.  There was a neighborhood man that drove a truck around every day talking to everyone and my parents were friendly with him,  but friends, just the quick hello and chat if he'd stop to ask my father about the yard etc\nWell bc of this I felt I knew him,  so when he called me over to his truck, with my dad in the shed not far away,  I ran over.  The fucking asshole said some things to me, small talk,  then he put his hand under my bathing suit and touched my vagina and mostly my clit. He kept saying tell me what this is. And put a finger inside of me. My spider senses were screaming to run to my dad. He said don't tell anyone. I ran to my dad but didn't tell him for some reason!!! He kept driving my every day but as soon as I saw him I ran inside or ran beside my dad and had the wear with all at 5 to stare him down in a way that he didn't really try anything again,  but I never got close to him either. I never told my parents.\nAnd now at my age,  45, I'm so angry and rage filled.  I have planned finding him and Confronting him, I want to hurt him.  I'm sure he is an old man now but I want to cause him pain.  I want to stand in front of him and ask him IF HE REMEMBERS ME  and touching my 5 YEAR OLD VAGINA??? YEA I remember the name of what its called asshole!! I want to tie him up and spit in his face. I have so much rage toward this man.  I have looked him up but lucky for him he is either dead or not able to be found.  Thinking of it now my chest is tight and my cheeks are burning.  It feels good to say it to write it. I never told my parents and I regret that.  My father could have taken care of this.  Or the police but I stayed silent. I regret that. I hope this man is ill and suffering.

The employees told me he was having a heroin overdose.\n\nFelt pretty useless tbh, I haven't finished doing my CPR certification, only done part of the online portion, and didnt feel confident at all in my cpr abilities.

Maybe we were wrong though, maybe he was breathing super lightly and did survive, idk I dont think its likely but there is a chance.

While I wouldn't have been the greatest at it at least I kind of understand it, but I didn't help.\n\nGuess I am just posting here to vent. What an awful night. I am doing a lot better today but last night I was definetly feeling a lot of guilt, guilt that I didn't help more, and that I just didn't feel a whole lot of anything while the situation was going on.\n\nWas very surreal afterwards, the second the ambulance showed up the employee went back to checking people out. It was a super surreal situation where people were waiting in line to checkout while there is somebody dying a few feet away from them (I get people react to these situations in different ways, it was just very surreal to me).

    "title": "How do I get away from my abuser when I'm fully dependent on him",
    "selftext": "My mom got married to my stepdad when I was about 10 or 11. Soon after, the first stages of grooming started. I didn't even know that what was happening was grooming until a few months ago when it was talked about in my psychology class. The abuse went on for about 8 or 9 years. I'm 19 now. It was severe I think but maybe I'm just being a bit dramatic about the whole thing. My mom had been diagnosed with breast cancer and got a double mastectomy and hysterectomy and after that, things got really bad. He made up fake people over the internet and was really good at it. I had a bestfriend, a boyfriend(that cheated on me every so often), Bestfriends stepdad(which she did stuff with also and who would sext me), boyfriends bestfriend(also tried to sext often), and a few other side characters like my boyfriends aunt that he messed around with and the girls he cheated on me with. I had these relationships for three years before finding out they were all fake. He also made another fake person, which was really just an identity we used to be able to talk about various things without anyone getting suspicious or seeing a message about sex under the contact \"dad\", and he used that fake person to get both (real) boyfriends I had to cheat on me. The actual sexual abuse usually happened through \"deals\" where we would agree on something he wanted to do and I would get something in return whether it be money, something off my amazon wishlist, a few more hours with my boyfriend, really anything I wanted. But sometimes it would be to get out of trouble and I have realized that I would often get in trouble for things I shouldn't have just so I would make a deal to keep my phone or avoid whatever punishment it was. And what was really fucked up is that I would get in trouble for sending nudes or sexting with the fake people(him) and would make deals to get out of the punishments. I think what really messed me up though and kinda brain-washed me is that if I didn't follow through with a deal to get out of a punishment, I would have to get that punishment and if I didn't follow through for something I wanted, I wouldn't get that thing. So there was always a negative consequence for not doing a deal after agreeing to it. He would make me feel bad and say \"so you're bailing on me?\" \"just say it. You're bailing on me\"  I lost my virginity to him the day before my 13th birthday. The whole thing is terrible but for some reason I love him. Maybe its a trauma bond or maybe I was just doomed from the start. I CRAVED a dad when I was little. My mom and I lived with my grandparents until she got married and I never knew who my real dad was. When I did finally meet him he ended up being a deadbeat piece of shit. I quickly clung on to my new dad and my mom fell into a deep depression so she wasnt really there most of the time. All I had was him. It really was the perfect setup for him to do this to me. Now I'm at a point where I know what happened to me was abuse and grooming and I need to report him. I don't want to because I really do love him so much as terrible as that is. But I am completely dependant on him. If he goes away I lose my ability to finish college, my home, probably all my pets (which maybe I deserve because I made a deal for every single one of them), I lose my car, my phone, my laptop and ipad which i heavily rely on for school(and also made a deal for), I lose my little brother(his biological son), and I'm sure I would lose my mom. She would hate me and probably disown me. I think my whole family would. She has suspected it before and so did my grandparents. My grandparents even filed a cps report once. I know my older sister has suspected it too. I'm sure I'm just spoiled since I've literally always gotten whatever I wanted and I know it sounds dumb to be worried about losing things like a laptop and phone. I'm sorry for that. I just don't really know what to do. Maybe I should just push through till grad school when I can really start living my own life. We don't make deals very much anymore but he doesn't let me forget it. He's always asking to make one and the more time goes on, the better the reward for making a deal where I don't have to do very much. It's hard to resist especially since I don't have money or gas now that we've pretty much stopped. Anyway sorry for how long this is. I probably didn't even need to say all this. I never get to talk about it. Any advice on what to do is appreciated.",

Without going into too much detail, I was deliberately manipulative and took advantage of someone more vulnerable than myself. Awful stuff.\n\nI don't think I fully understood the gravity of what I'd done until this person confronted me years later and explained to me how my actions had affected them. I completely owned what I'd done and still do. I was a shitty human being who committed some positively atrocious acts.\n\nI worked through what I'd done as best as I could with the person I'd hurt, and they ended up forgiving me. It took me longer to forgive myself, but I eventually got there. I've accepted that although I am 100% responsible for the hardship that I caused, I'm a different person now than I was five years ago. I've learnt from my mistakes and am committed to being a positive force in the world, rather than the reckless piece of shit that I've been in the past.\n\nWith that said, I'm absolutely haunted by the things that I've done. They hang over me like a dark cloud literally every day of my life. Maybe I don't deserve it, but eventually I'd like to be able to let go of the past and move on. I just don't know where to start.\n\nIf anyone could offer me advice or share a similar experience, I'd be extremely grateful.",

    "selftext": "Most of the time walking is a means to get us from A to B and while we‚Äôre walking we‚Äôre thinking about the task that needs to be done once we get there. We're lost in plans and worries about the future, not noticing how we're feeling or our surroundings. By slowing down and paying attention we can extract joy from something that we do every day.\n\nYou can start by focusing internally - slowing down the pace to a couple of steps for your inbreath, a couple of steps for your outbreath. As you‚Äôre slowing down you can begin to notice the pressure of your feet on the ground. As you take each step you can feel the pressure begin at the heel of your foot and flow through the sole to toes, then lifting from the heel again. Really focusing on that feeling, noticing the connection with the ground. As you do this you can notice thoughts arrive and leave, not being swept away by those thoughts but smiling to them, accepting them and letting them go, returning our attention to the feeling of walking on the earth. You can feel some gratitude for your feet, being aware of how important they are for getting around. \n\nThen you can focus your awareness on your surroundings, starting with what you can hear - birdsong, a plane in the sky, the wind in the trees. You can stop for ten breaths and really focus your attention on one thing, for example a tree or a flower. Taking in its shape, size, colour, texture,  everything you can sense - taking some time to pay attention to the exclusion of everything else. After giving it some time, you can return to your walk until something else catches your eye.\n\nWhen we walk mindfully, we don‚Äôt walk to arrive anywhere, we‚Äôve already arrived in the present moment. We don‚Äôt even do a walking meditation to make ourselves calm or happy - having goals for meditation tends to get in the way. We walk simply to enjoy each step; to be present with walking, giving ourselves permission to let go of worries about the future and regrets from the past. That being said - there‚Äôs lots of evidence to show that walking in nature is very good for our wellbeing, even thinking about nature can relax us and lift our mood.\n\n[Listen On Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-power-of-a-walk-in-nature/id1493806566?i=1000521823405)\n\n[Listen On Google Podcasts](https://www.google.com/podcasts?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9hbmNob3IuZm0vcy8xMjNkZThlMC9wb2RjYXN0L3Jzcw==)\n\n[Listen On Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/1ozwIEgzEtHQezPoi83nVV)\n\n[Other ways to listen](https://anchor.fm/shaun-donaghy/episodes/The-power-of-a-walk-in-nature-e10se7v)",

Then breathe and allow the thought to pass. Notice what feelings you have attached to them.

We might be judging our co-worker for being abrupt, we might think ‚Äúwhat an asshole‚Äù, especially if we don‚Äôt know them well. We might be judging ourselves, thinking that we did something to set them off.

    "selftext": "I hope this is the right place to post something like this. This is the first time I‚Äôve posted something to Reddit. I‚Äôm 24f and I have had next to no physical contact with men in the past two years. To summarize my story, I have daddy issues. I was a really sensitive kid and the way my dad raised me was not the best. Mostly verbal and some physical abuse but nothing too crazy. He isn‚Äôt a bad person, I still love him, and I have accepted that he hasn‚Äôt dealt with some trauma of his own. But this led me to develop an attraction to (usually) older and always toxic men that didn‚Äôt treat me well. What really sent me to my breaking point was the last few months of my senior year in college. I was sleeping around and experimenting with BDSM. I had a really bad experience with a dom and it was only months after the experience that I realized how wrong it was. But anyways shortly after that experience I met the person I thought I was going to marry. Long story short the emotional abuse was so bad that it eventually sent me into an episode of psychosis and I was involuntarily put into a psyche ward for a week. In a way, I will always be grateful that this happened because even though I was out of touch with reality, it woke something up inside me. I had a huge shift in how I thought and thankfully my parents were able to keep me away from my ex long enough for me to realize I needed to cut contact with him. It took me 6 months after that to get back on my feet and fast forward to now and I feel better than ever. I‚Äôm generally a very happy person and have a positive outlook on life. I‚Äôve gotten over a lot of issues I used to have and am all around a healthier person. However, whenever I am thrown into situations with men is when everything starts getting screwed up again. Whenever I come across guys who are interested in me and display red flags, even though I recognize this, it is incredibly hard for me to not go along with what they want even though I know I don‚Äôt want it. How do I get over this kind of thing? How do I rewire myself to be attracted to people who would be good for me? How do I know when I‚Äôll be ready to start dating again? I‚Äôm starting to regain my desire for sex and I‚Äôm starting to feel lonely sometimes but I‚Äôm too afraid to get sucked back into my old toxic lifestyle to do anything about it. Also, I‚Äôm not interested in therapy. I tried going a few times 3 months after I got out of the psyche ward and maybe it was just a bad experience but the lady made me angry and it gave me the motivation to do everything by myself and I ended up putting myself back on my feet.",

I watch pornography since I was 12.\n\nIt began normally as a lot of boys at the time, but I started searching for more different stuff when I was getting older. I got into ageplay with other people online (that \"little/daddy\" stuff that it's common with young people nowadays and a lot of people think it's cringe).\n\nI liked to role play, read stories about it, watch videos etc. I was in some groups on Discord, Twitter and other social media. In one of those groups, about a year ago, someone sent a link to some site that had \"free paid videos\" about it. I clicked. It had a lot of stuff, but as soon as I saw one post of that site in specific, I wanted to throw up. It was images of sexual abuse of minors.\n\nI closed the site but that image was still in my head (it was too sensitive/disgusting one). I remember that I got the link and reported it online. Some months passed and from time to time that image was still in my head. There was a day that I had a fucking horrible nightmare about that and I woke up throwing up. I couldn't stop thinking about the victims. I needed to do something.\n\nAfter some time searching and stuff, I created an account on Twitter. It was focused on finding, reporting and exposing sexual predators (that were active on chats trying to prey on young people or sharing/asking for ilegal porn). I never got in touch with that kind of material after that first time. The profile grew, I reported more than 100 people (I even created a group of \"fans\" that helped me!). Then I decided to infiltrate myself in some suspect groups like on Discord etc. It was really good when I discovered the account/group was taken down because of my report - and I decided that it was that what I wanted to do: I wanted to work at law enforcement in the IT field catching these people.\n\nSo... here comes the most fucked up part: there was a person in a specific social media that I was \"spying\" today posting strange strange links. I checked those sites. It was full (really full) of illegal stuff. I almost had a heart attack. I got all the information I could about the site and reported it online - but now I'm in shock, All that bad feelings I had came back. I cannot eat anymore, I cannot study, I cannot do anything because I'm in shock. The images, those totally inhuman shit were so fucking disgusting, so fucking bad that I'm starting to have panick attacks. I'm shaking reading this. I know it can souns silly, but they are terrifying...\n\nThey are so fucking bad... so bad... I can't forget them. I try, try and try but they come back. They are monsters. I lost all my sanity because of that - because of trying to \"get information and report\". This last year I fought so hard to cope with the \"first shock\" I had in the past, and now it just came back 1000x worse. I already reported the site and everything I could, but it doesn't help. My mind is in an insane mode right now.\n\nPlease, someone help me. I decided that it was enough and I won't \"catch predators\" or work doing it anymore (should have decided it earlier, I know, I was extremely dumb). I just want mental peace. I know it can sound silly but, it really fucked my head. I need help... what can I do?? I'm almost crying... I fucked my brain trying to be a \"super hero\" and I regret it so, so much!",

    "selftext": "Had a casual talk with my psychiatrist, she asked if there was anything traumatic that happened to me when I was younger. I said \"no\", obviously not or else I would've known and I would have remembered, but now I'm lying in bed and I can't sleep because I started to remember things that might be considered \"trauma\" under my DR's eyes. Although, I believe my \"trauma\" is nothing compared to others and I don't even think it's worth talking about since obviously I lived a good couple of years without having any big symptoms of suppressed trauma. Below are memories that I talked with a friend and she definitely agrees that these are sources of something. (Disclaimer: It looks like I'm trying to hunt down trauma, I would like to say that I just want an explanation for why I am so mentally ill but honestly maybe I am looking for trauma to feel like a victim. I'm not sure. Maybe I am just desperate)\n\nFirst one, not having a dad and only having him enter my life when I was 7. My mom had me when my dad had a fully developed family already. My mom and I were just outsiders in his life at this point of his life. I actually didn't know this and only found out recently as I don't remember ever not having my dad (i'm a teen) but my mom told me so much information about how I would always ask where's my dad and asking all the questions about him and my mom (i love her so much) couldn't tell me at the time that he had a family of his own. The first couple of weeks/months after he came into my life though was all good I think. From images I have, I seemed very happy and bubbly although I can't remember anything. \n\nSecondly, my mom thinks I was mistreated or picked upon by her friend's children. Since I didn't have a dad from the age seven and below and that my mom worked night shifts until morning, I was left at the friend of my mom's home. Let's call her Jane just for easy typing purposes. Jane was relatively nice I think, I barely remember any memories from her but I remember parts of furniture and that she also watched other children younger than me at her home at the same time. I also remember that I borrowed a lot of toys from their home and Jane's children would always complain about it and I was constantly ignored by them. (They were either teenagers or around 11+ I think, but I can't remember their face. When I try to it's all blurry). My mom asked me recently if I was ever slapped or hit during my stays at their home as sometimes I would go home with red rashes (like I was slapped or something) and my cheek to this day is very uneven but I really don't think so at all honestly because children get hurt, it's normal. Another memory I have is when I would pretend to sleep. My mom would carry me up the stairs and lay me down at Joe's bed (Jane's cousin/brother? i wasn't sure and still isn't sure) and when I try to think about me in the bed now, I just think of me crying and looking at the space underneath the distance between the wall and bed and the heavy smell of urine. I wrote this down because I want to remember this for the future because I tend to forget about this. \n\nThirdly, a couple years after my dad entered my life. (Still younger than ten) \nI would wake up early morning to moans and loud groaning and I would realise that my dad was watching porn in the same room as I was. (Now, thinking about it I think I was 8 or 9 because somehow at the age I knew it was something very sexual) I remember looking up slightly without him noticing and seeing him with a blanket trying to cover up the screen. I knew for a fact he wasn't aware I was awake but he covered the screen. I remember just quietly sobbing every night and crying even though I had no real reason to. I just felt so scared for some reason, and felt guilty. I laugh about this nowadays though with a really close friend (I say this because it is embarrassing to just share this around any friend lol)\n\nLastly, (for now, i think i'm forgetting something major) I was at home at late night both with my mom and dad (i think i was 7 or 8) when a drug addict broke in. When I try to remember it now, I remember watching a TV show in my parents bedroom with my parents and then the rest is blacked out and then cut to me crying while wrapped under blankets and my parents duvet. I remember the horrific screams of my aunt and my mom and the horrified voice of my mom/aunt(?) calling the phone for the police. I remember at the time I thought aliens were invading our house but I genuinely remember crying so hard and being so scared hearing screams from my family. My parents and I laugh about it nowadays but the other day after my therapy session, I was laying in bed and it hit me that I am also wrapped up under a blanket. It felt so clear to me because my whole family knows and even extended family knows about how I sleep in a side fetus position with my blanket wrapped around my head and how I almost always sleep in this position. The only times I wouldn't sleep in this position is when I feel really hot and I don't use blankets but even then I still return in that position afterwards after I feel cool down and that if I don't sleep in that position, I feel really vulnerable but I am getting better at that. I also feel that I am too cautious at night, when I am about to go to bed I check if the main door is double locked and when I go to the toilet at night at dark, I have to check corners and I always hurry because in my brain I always imagine that there will be a man there waiting for me. (i know thats really stupid) but this also could be that i watched too much horror movies growing up so I just picked up this habit but the blanket issue felt so surreal like I just answered something that I've been waiting the answer for but I also could just be desperate for an answer on why I am considered mentally ill when I never lived a hard life or the fact that I am not exactly dirt poor (my mom a care assistant, dad retired, rented house that i'm living in is old and mouldy with mouse and spider infestations).\n^\nJust realising at the sentence I typed above in the brackets explains that I might just have a victim complex because I think I wrote the part of the details of my house for you readers to feel bad for me and just proof of my desperate nature for reassurance, I think I am being dramatic with all this typing but I am going to post it because I want to know your opinions and I also wrote too much just to get rid of it all. Please give me your opinions, if you think I'm being dramatic and that most people go through what I go through or maybe that some of the stuff I said makes sense? Please let me know.",

    "title": "If you have the desire to improve the way you manage anxiety, or even to overcome it, there is a key concept that once understood and developed in a consistent way, can greatly accelerate your progress. I call it ‚ÄúSafety Net‚Äù.",
    "selftext": "If you have the desire to improve the way you manage anxiety, or even to overcome it, there is a key concept that once understood and developed in a consistent way, can greatly accelerate your progress. I call it ‚ÄúSafety Net‚Äù.\n\nAlthough I benefited immensely from professional help to heal from trauma and overcome deep-rooted fears that fueled my anxiety, a lot of my progress was due to daily practices done on my own. I believe a healthy combination of both strategies is the best for most of us and neglecting any of them can lead us to get stuck.\n\nThe concept of a ‚ÄúSafety Net‚Äù came to me because when I started challenging myself to face triggering situations, I felt I was walking on a tightrope 100 meters above the ground. In the beginning, the slightest wind would make me lose my balance, so after a few falls, I realised I would be better off building a safety net: a robust and reliable process that would allow me to reset my state whenever I went too far.\n\nTherefore, a safety net is not a thing, it is a step-by-step process that you can rely on to calm yourself down, reset your stress response, safely reprogram your nervous system, heal and progressively expand your comfort zone.\n\nI made a lot of mistakes when I decided to try to overcome anxiety. One of the biggest mistakes was forcing myself to be in situations that would trigger me badly. On top of that, I would repeat it over and over again, which caused me suffering, not only because of the immediate negative consequences but also because of the self-hatred talk that would follow up in my head.\n\nEvery time I felt I had failed at something, I would punish myself and it would take me days or weeks to get back to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù, causing my anxiety to worsen and making it harder to face the same challenge next time. It was a vicious destructive cycle that felt like a trap I couldn‚Äôt escape.\n\nIt might sound like self-punishment but I did it for a reason. I was split inside. On one hand, I deeply desired to overcome anxiety, I wanted to be ‚Äúnormal‚Äù, I wanted to be free. On the other, I wanted to stay away from any triggering scenario. For instance, a part of me wanted to be able to be social and talk to people, but another part was deeply scared, stressed and just wanted to run away. Therefore, for quite a while I put myself in social situations that I wasn‚Äôt able to handle and that often caused me to have visceral revolting reactions, some of which were likely re-traumatizing.\n\nEventually, it became clear that I needed to be able to deal with my stress response and heal a deeper wound. At the time, I did not call it that, it was just the ‚Äúthing‚Äù I felt inside and I had no control over. Although I was unaware of the connection between anxiety and trauma, I started to work towards being able to recover from being triggered. That‚Äôs when the concept of ‚ÄúSafety Net‚Äù was born.\n\nI needed a process that allowed me to calm myself down and reset my state. By state I mean my stress response plus the way I felt about myself. In a nutshell: my general state of wellbeing. If I was able to do that, it would mean that I could step into challenging, potentially triggering, situations and at any time I could step back into safety. Therefore, every time I bit more than I could chew, I could get out of the situation and reset. It meant that I could finally start trying new things and gain control. With time, it allowed me to take risks on my own terms.\n\nTo build my safety net, I started practicing calming myself down in the safest environment I knew: my room. I remember thinking that if I wasn‚Äôt able to calm myself down in the safety of my room, I wouldn't be able to manage it in challenging environments.\n\nIn my case, it all started with reframing perspectives, doing mindful meditations, and changing my inner self-talk. Then, I was introduced to techniques to attune directly to certain states or emotions without relying on thoughts, so everything became easier, safer and more direct. Attuning directly to love and gratitude are some of the most effective ways to find the feeling of safety.\n\nAlthough I am presenting here these strategies as a shortlist, developing this process wasn‚Äôt neither easy nor straightforward. Building our safety net requires us more than acquiring effective skills, it also requires us to change our attitude towards our struggles, our behaviours and our relationship with our past.\n\nMoreover, building a safety net involves implementing daily practices and cultivating qualities that might be missing in us. In my case, courage was lacking, so I cultivated it with the appropriate practices.\n\nIf you are curious about the concept of safety net and would like to build your own, I suggest you start with strategies that rely only on your focus and build it up from there. These can be extremely effective to calm yourself down and even the most simple ones can be healing when done the appropriate way for long periods of time. I am going to give you some suggestions on how to do that. Bear in mind that even when it comes to building a safety net, safety should be your priority. If at any point you feel strong body reactions or the beginning of a stress response, you should either stop or proceed with caution.\n\nI suggest that one should start with approaches that rely on our attention, our ability to control our focus because these approaches are usually safe if you choose carefully what you are focusing on. If your anxiety is deeply rooted in trauma and focusing on the inside (breath, emotions, etc) is too overwhelming, try focusing outside instead. In practical terms, it means that you sit down for 20 minutes and focus on sounds, or you observe a simple object, or you do colouring, or you focus on the tactile sensation of a blanket or a warm bath.\n\nThere are many examples, the important thing is that you pick one that is not triggering for you and helps you connect with the feeling of safety. Once you reach the state of safety you need to familiarize yourself with it, imprint it in your mind, register it, memorize it. Then, you need to give it a genuine try by practicing consistently. Keep in mind that eventually, you should progress to shift your attention to the inside but that should be done gently if you experience any resistance.\n\nAfter that, you should switch to grounding techniques and eventually work towards attuning directly to certain emotions or inner states. As I mentioned before, this whole work should be complemented with changes in attitude, mindsets and perspectives. The more effective tools you are able to use to your advantage, the more robust will be the safety net and the faster you will be able to feel safe after being triggered.\n\n\"Safety net\" is a concept that applies to therapy too. There are therapy methods that, although effective, can lead to chaotic thoughts and emotional dysregulation. Having a safety net really makes a huge difference in such scenarios. In my own experience, I have found that for instance, certain types of shadow work can be very destabilizing, and having a safety net really helped me get back on my feet and regain an inner sense of balance.\n\nThis process should be personalised to yourself, so in the words of Bruce Lee: ‚ÄúAdapt what is useful, reject what is useless, and add what is specifically your own.‚Äù.\n\nI strongly believe that a safety net is a must-have for anyone struggling with anxiety. If you have any questions, I am glad to give specific suggestions on the practices you can include in your own process.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nS√©rgio",

    "title": "Seven key attitudes for a happy life according to Jon Kabat Zinn",
    "selftext": "**Non-judgment** - paying attention to your opinions as they arise. JKZ talks about how the human mind sorts things into boxes - good, bad, neutral. By taking a perspective of non-judgement and being aware we can take the most joy from the good things, accept the bad things (doing us less harm), and become more aware of the neutral things, realising how much they contribute to our lives. Of course judgmental thoughts still arise but we can simply observe them and let them pass without acting on them.\n\n\n**Patience** - letting things unfold in their own time. Meditation isn‚Äôt difficult to learn but it does require patience and persistence. It takes some time to see the benefits of it, you need to stick with it. Doing it once a week is helpful but when you make time for a little bit of practice every day for six weeks the evidence shows its actually rewiring how your brain works, you‚Äôre training yourself to be happy. Its also about being patience with ourselves, not setting expectations for achieving a standard in a specific time, and being patient with others who have lived their life through a set of circumstances we‚Äôre not aware of. \n\n\n**Beginners mind** - seeing the world as if for the first time and seeing the infinite possibilities. Knowledge can limit our perception of what we don‚Äôt know, part of becoming wise (rather than clever) is getting comfortable with what we don‚Äôt know. When we accumulate a lot of knowledge and become jaded by experience we can lose touch with the joy in our lives.\n\n\n**Trust** - listening to our bodies and our senses. Trusting that if we let go of anxieties about the future and regrets from the past and live in the present that everything will be OK - because it really will. When we cultivate trust in ourselves through practice, when we build our calmness and peace and live in the present moment  we start to trust other people more because we‚Äôre not jumping ahead to what they might do or questioning their motives - we‚Äôre existing in the present taking their words and actions at face value. Really listening to other people with an open mind is when we make strong human connections. \n\n\n**Non-striving** - we‚Äôre always trying to get somewhere, always running toward a destination. But an important aspect of mindfulness is realising that you have arrived in the here and now. We can‚Äôt live happily in the future; if everything we‚Äôre doing is to achieve, we sacrifice our wellbeing in the present. We tell ourselves we‚Äôll be happy when we get promoted, we get married, we have kids, when we retire. This is the only time we can be happy - mindfulness is called the art of stopping, sometimes we have to ease off with the future plans and enjoy where we are and who we‚Äôre with.\n\n\n**Acceptance** - accepting that things are the way they are. Which is not to say you don‚Äôt do anything about it, the idea is that you are aware in the present moment, you see things as they are and you can decide what it is you want to do. There‚Äôs a myth that mindfulness somehow makes you OK with injustice and suffering - the opposite is true! When we accept the world in front of us, accept people, accept yourself, you can act out of emotional intelligence and compassion rather than anger or fear. \n\n\n**Letting go** - by identifying the attachments we have we can trace the roots of our anger, our fear, our sadness and understand why we react the way we do in certain circumstances. Once we apply our awareness to our attachments we can start to understand ourselves, we can start to feel compassion for ourselves, then we can start to let go of our suffering.\n\n\n[Listen for more](https://link.chtbl.com/tDsqppjK)",

    "title": "The cure for loneliness - accepting our fear and building our compassion for others",
    "selftext": "One of the grim features of modern life is loneliness - we can be in a crowd of people but still feel alone, all of us lonely together. That feeling is something that we're afraid of; the fear of loneliness can be worse than the feeling itself, resulting in us trying to distract ourselves with other things.\n\nWhen we‚Äôre feeling blue we distract ourselves by turning the TV on, having a snack or a drink, or going on Youtube. Consumption will make us feel a little better for a moment but only makes the problem worse in the long term, even social media is something for us to consume rather than offering a real human connection.\n\nTo begin to tend to our loneliness we can focus our awareness on how we‚Äôre feeling. We don‚Äôt have to be afraid of loneliness, it‚Äôs a normal part of the human experience. We have evolved as a social animal, so when we‚Äôre spending a lot of time alone or we‚Äôre not making a real connection with others we‚Äôre motivated to come together. Shine the light of awareness on the feeling, listen to it. As crazy as it sounds, loneliness is your friend and is just looking out for you.\n\nIts also worth being aware of how we feel about making new friends. Everyone has anxiety around meeting new people which can get in the way of connecting with people. We wonder what people think about us, we worry that we‚Äôre  being judged, we build it up in our heads until the point where we think that it‚Äôs better not to try. But we can get around this block by accepting that we‚Äôre feeling anxious about meeting people and examining whether our fears are true. For example - will people really judge us, or will they just accept us at face value?\n\nPracticing compassion and becoming interested in other people is the most important way to tend to our loneliness. When we develop our calm / peace, we start to focus less on ourselves and more on others. We notice their needs and see the everyday suffering of other people. We feel compelled to act and to help that person, even if the help is just listening deeply without judgement. When you really listen and allow someone to empty their heart, that's when you can really make a human connection. \n\n[Listen On Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-cure-for-loneliness/id1493806566?i=1000507990708)\n\n[Listen On Google Podcasts](https://www.google.com/podcasts?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9hbmNob3IuZm0vcy8xMjNkZThlMC9wb2RjYXN0L3Jzcw==)\n\n[Listen On Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/1ozwIEgzEtHQezPoi83nVV)\n\n[Other ways to listen](https://anchor.fm/shaun-donaghy/episodes/The-cure-for-loneliness-eq14js)",

Perhaps, together, we'll find some answers that may change your life...So here goes.\n¬†\nAre you aware that you had to adopt survival strategies to survive your family of origin?¬† Some of us are more aware than others of this process (some may be very painfully aware) but we all experienced degrees of dysfunction in our childhood.¬† Degrees.¬† Not all childhoods were equally painful or traumatizing.¬† Some survival strategies we adopted were extremely subtle and may be hard to detect.¬† Nevertheless, everything we did in our childhood was a survival strategy, even if we were unaware of it at the time.¬† We were innocent, vulnerable little beings that counted on the care of other beings for our survival.¬† Some of our families were REALLY screwed up and some were only a little screwed up but in either case we had to at least try to fit in.¬†¬†\n¬†\nSo what were your survival strategies?¬† Were you discouraged from showing emotion? Discouraged from receiving emotion? Maybe you were put in your bedroom like me when you were \"bad\" for hours at a time and no one came to check on you.¬† Maybe, like me, you were told to stick your nose in the corner for hours and not told why.¬† Maybe you were taught to feel guilt and shame for exploring your body and it's natural sensations.¬† Maybe you were forced to yell and act out to get attention.¬† Maybe you were taught to \"please\" your parents and if you didn't \"please\" them (whatever that means) you were not given love or attention. ¬† Some things are more subtle. Did your parents rush you to get ready for school each day? Do you now feel a subtle sense of fear of being late and always needing to get somewhere early?¬† Were you taught to always \"work hard\" to \"earn your keep\"?¬† What beliefs, religious or otherwise, were you forced to adopt to fit in? The point is this: there are literally infinite numbers of ways (some subtle and some not so subtle) that our families of origins and even our peer groups/teachers/etc. could have acted dysfunctionally toward us and we were forced to come up with creative survival strategies to fit in.¬† Hopefully, you're already starting to reflect on these questions for yourself.¬† Look and see if survival strategies you were forced to use growing up are still being used in your life.¬† Sometimes we even adopt and develop, in our adult life, the attitude that we will \"NEVER BE LIKE OUR PARENTS'' and try to do the exact opposite.¬† But even this strategy is still born out of dysfunction because it is yet another survival strategy that comes out of trauma.¬†¬†\n¬†\nSo here is the crux of it...are these strategies you adopted still serving you?¬† Maybe they are, maybe they aren't but only WE can decide that for ourselves.¬† And we can only figure that out by asking the questions and taking the time to really reflect and look into it.¬† \n\nHere I'm going to give you my criteria to help you decide whether or not your survival strategies are still serving you.¬† It is simple and here it is:¬† Self-love.¬† Now, Self-love is a very deep and profound topic that I will do another post on entirely but for our purposes here it's something that needs to simply be felt into.¬† Are you loving yourself? Does whatever you are doing help you to FEEL more loved by yourself?¬† Does it help you to accept yourself to greater and greater degrees?¬† Does the strategy help you to be more authentic?¬† If what you're doing doesn't help you to embrace your authenticity and to be more loving and accepting of who and what you really are, consider contemplating alternatives that can fit into this criteria.¬† This will take conscious effort but I think it's worth it.¬† We are all at different places on our healing journey, but make no mistake, everyone is on a healing journey.¬† Consider embracing more love and acceptance for yourself each and every day with each and every action you take.¬† Will you start today?\n¬†\nNamaste.",

    "title": "Death By Childhood - How Our Trauma Is Slowly Killing Us",
    "selftext": " However  dark the theme, I hope it inspires some people to keep up the therapy  and keep doing whatever helps! It can be hard to keep going and we all  hit plateaus.\n\n[Death By Childhood - How Our Trauma Is Slowly Killing Us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Xr0cOCgGeY)\n\nA  link between emotional well-being and idiopathic diseases such as  cancer and autoimmune disorders has long been suspected, theorized  about, and researched, but thanks to the works of Arthur Janov and Gabor  Mate, a clear mechanism can now be pointed to.\n\nFor  this video I wanted to explain the basics of the repression system, the  mechanisms through which the body and brain work together to make you  not remember early traumas, and feel no pain in relation to memories  that must have been painful.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor those who prefer reading, I've provided a transcript:\n\n\"I don't know why I'm depressed.\"\n\n\"I guess my childhood was fine.\"\n\n\" I don't remember much of it.\"\n\nYou know, it's actually not just mentally, but also physically dangerous, not deal with that stuff!\n\nCan trauma cause cancer?\n\nIt's becoming quite clear that there's a link between emotional stress and physical ailments.\n\nHowever, it's not clear to everyone how that actually works.\n\nSo in this video, I'm gonna quickly try to make that really clear.\n\nSo  first of all, the brain doesn't know the difference between physical  pain and emotional pain, right? So that means that if you get in a car  accident and you become traumatized physically, and the pain is too big  for your system to integrate, then you will probably have memory loss  after that car accident.\n\nOr if something else happens to you physically that is just so painful that it's too much, then you won't remember it.\n\nSo  in the same way when something happens to you that is emotionally too  painful, you remember it, and that's actually a good thing because if  you get, god forbid, raped or abused in some way in your childhood, for  example, by a family member or whatever it may be, maybe it's not like a  physical direct abuse, but it's more like lack of attention,  chronically lack of love, chronically, anything like that could  accumulate into something that is too painful for a child to actually  realize.\n\nAnd why is that? Well, you know, if a child doesn't get attention for one day, it's not that bad.\n\nBut  if he doesn't, if he doesn't get attention all the time, then at some  point he's gonna have to realize I'm never gonna get the attention that I  need in order to develop myself in order to grow up.\n\nAnd  basically what that means is my parents just don't love me enough and  they will never be there for me in the way that I need.\n\nAnd that realization is incredibly emotionally painful, and that's something that the child will never be consciously aware of.\n\nBoth the emotional pain that is too devastating to be able to cope with.\n\nAnd physical pain that is too devastating to be able to cope with causes memory loss.\n\nWhat  that actually means is that even though you do remember it at some  level your system remembers, your consciousness doesn't remember.\n\nSo  at the level that you were thinking, you don't, you, you can't recall  it consciously, basically you don't know that it happened to you or you  don't know what it was like, or you know, the event, but not what it  felt like.\n\nAnd they remember some things that happened to them that probably weren't so nice, but they think, well, it's fine.\n\nI don't really remember any pain from that.\n\nYeah, that's because the outward effect is memory loss.\n\nBut what it actually means is the memory is still there, but it's been shut off.\n\nIt's been gated.\n\nAnd so this has been done by the repressive system.\n\nSo I want to introduce the concept of the repression system.\n\nThis  is the system in your body is comprised of several functions, but what  it is responsible for is to shield your consciousness, your active  awareness from pain that is too hard to deal with and would actually be  dangerous to deal with.\n\nSo this could be physical pain or emotional pain.\n\nAnd it's actually good because too much pain is dangerous.\n\nLike it can actually, too much pain can cause you, your psyche to disintegrate.\n\nIt can cause you to to go crazy or it can actually cause death.\n\nSo this is not a joke.\n\nIt's not like you shouldn't have had this impact of this, this particular pain being blocked out.\n\nNow you should have had it blocked out because if you hadn't had it blocked out, you could have died.\n\nIt could have been really dangerous.\n\nSo it's there for a reason, but what this is, it means is now it becomes a trauma.\n\nA trauma is when pain was too big to feel, and then it gets blocked.\n\nAnd very simply put, that's what a trauma is.\n\nAnd when it gets blocked, it means that it's still there, but you can't access it, therefore it is stuck.\n\nSo  when a tr when a pain is stuck, it's still bothering you, it's still  causing mayhem in the body and in the psyche, but you're not aware of  it.\n\nThere's gates in the brain that are able to block different levels of consciousness from each other.\n\nAnd I'll quickly draw for you how that works.\n\nSo  I've talked about the different levels of the human psyche before, very  simply, it's thinking, feeling, sensing and thinking is, is pretty con  is pretty obvious.\n\nIt's, it's your  conscious and awareness and what you think and what you believe and  what basically everything that goes on your stories that you have in  your head and the voice that you have in your head.\n\nAnd that is called the third line, or that's basically the thinking level.\n\nThen below that, there's the feeling level.\n\nAnd by feeling, I mean emotional feeling.\n\nSo  here, here's where all the anger and the sadness and the joy and the  love and the feelings, the emotional feelings live deeper than that  though is the reptile brain.\n\nReptiles famously don't have emotions, but they can feel, they can feel physical things.\n\nThey can sense all the sensations that come with having a body internal digestive tract, lungs, heart, et cetera.\n\nAnd also external, just like maintaining.\n\nIt's maintaining the status of everything that happens inside the body, inside the physical.\n\nAnd therefore it can have states such as terror and fight or flight.\n\nBut this is as deep as it goes.\n\nAnd this level also develops a lot earlier than the feeling system develops.\n\nThe feeling system only starts to mature as a child is five to six months old.\n\nThat's when it starts to develop simple emotions.\n\nBefore that it's only pain or no pain in deadly trouble, or not inly trouble fight or flights terror or we're good.\n\nIt's, it's very, very simplistic.\n\nAnd that's what what the reptile brain is responsible for.\n\nAnd that is the sensing system.\n\nSo basically we have three levels.\n\nIt's thinking, feeling, and sensing.\n\nSo  what happens when a catastrophic impact is made on one of these levels  that the other levels probably couldn't deal with? That's when they get  are activated.\n\nSo if you have a  car accident or someone tortures you or something really bad happens  that causes a lot of physical pain, you're sensing system might take the  impact, take a lot of pain, and this would immediately activate the  gates.\n\nSo  here I've illustrated that you would basically have an enormous pain at  the sensing level, but when your system, your body recognizes this pain  is going to be too big, this is a huge problem, we might self-destruct.\n\nIf we let this into our full awareness, then the gates will be activated.\n\nSo basically the pain from the sensing level is trying to come up to be experienced.\n\nAnd if you would be able to experience it safely, then you would move through it and there would not be a trauma created.\n\nBut because it's too much, your system detects we cannot move through this and we need to block this.\n\nAnd then the gates activate.\n\nSo  the gates are basically neurons that are constantly sending inhibitory  signals and block the communication between these levels.\n\nSo this is basically blocked.\n\nThis means that your emotional system doesn't know what actually the big sensory pain was or has been.\n\nThis, it starts when this pain is inflicted, but then it continues.\n\nAnd then your, your system is always working, constantly sending these like sh sh sh sh sh, sh, sh, sh, sh shushing signals.\n\nBasically.\n\nIt's exhausting to do.\n\nAnd,  and that's basically how you live your life from there on onwards until  you basically do something like EMDR or another kind of therapy that  deals with the trauma like primal therapy or regression therapy or, or  emdr, anything that would basically address this level and, and dig out  this pain dig out this experience.\n\nUntil you do that, you're blissfully unaware that there has ever been this level of pain.\n\nAnd you're always, these neurons are always firing these, these shh signals.\n\nShut up, shut up, shut up.\n\nWe don't wanna know.\n\nSo your, your emotions are not aware and also your thinking is not aware of how painful that was.\n\nNow, when something happens that is emotionally very painful, same thing.\n\nSo  basically say your parents divorce or something like that, and you're  like five years old, you don't know how to deal with it.\n\nYou feel completely, you feel very unsafe.\n\nLike no one's going to take care of you and, and you're basically on your own.\n\nAnd this is too much to deal with.\n\nThis is as, as this is happening, this is going to mess with your thinking too much.\n\nYou will basically go nuts or or die.\n\nSo  that means that the gates are activated and also here on this level the  disconnection is then made between the thinking level and the feeling  level, which means that this giant ball of pain of like, I'm unsafe.\n\nMy  parents can't even take care of themselves or make a harmonious home  for me because they're constantly fighting with each other and splitting  up.\n\nI'm all alone, blah, blah, blah.\n\nIt's too painful.\n\nThe gates are activated.\n\nThey're constantly shushing this pain and creating a, a disconnect between the thinking level and the feeling level.\n\nAnd this is how you get people that can say that they're fine and believe that they're fine.\n\nAnd emotionally they're absolutely not fine.\n\nThey have a lot of tension in their body, for example.\n\nAnd  they might, might be very jumpy and overreact to a lot of things and  get easily triggered and, but they think that they're fine and they  don't really know what they're feeling.\n\nSo they think they're fine, but the reason that they don't know what they're feeling is because the gates are active.\n\nOkay? So that's one part of the repression system.\n\nWhy am I telling you this? Because this takes a lot of energy.\n\nThis takes a lot of energy.\n\nSo one drawback basically is that it's just a stress on your body to constantly have these gates activated.\n\nYou have to see this as like a huge electrical charge trying to discharge.\n\nAnd then to counteract that, the body has to, the brain has to constantly fire signals at, at that.\n\nSo it, it's costing you a lot of electrical energy literally to suppress that pain.\n\nBut that's not all that the regression system does.\n\nSo it has gates, but it also has endorphins.\n\nIt also has endorphins.\n\nSo endorphins are your internal painkillers.\n\nThey're much stronger than you could actually externally take.\n\nSo  your endorphins that your body is able to produce, and these are the  feel good, feel good chemicals that you also feel when you might go for a  run for like an hour.\n\nOr you might go for a walk for like two, two or three hours.\n\nYou feel this great endorphin rush.\n\nAnd this is the substance that your body produces, that interacts with the op receptors.\n\nDoes the same thing with heroin, morphine other op opiate drugs who do, it's a very potent internally produced painkiller.\n\nSo it's a very potent internally produced painkiller.\n\nGreat.\n\nAnd  it's fine to enjoy that after you've had a run or you've had a walk or  you've had some sort of exercise that also helps to feel not completely  broken after exercise.\n\nSo what's wrong with that? There's gating.\n\nSo I don't know that I've been hurt and I don't know that that pain is still there.\n\nGreat,  yeah, it costs a bit of energy, but you know, I, I've got energy, who  cares? You might say, well actually gates is not enough.\n\nBecause  if you just had the gating, then you're not aware that you've been  hurt, you're not aware that you have a physical or an emotional trauma,  but your body still very much is in pain even though you don't know  what's going on.\n\nAnd therefore you also need the endorphins.\n\nYou also need the painkillers to be elevated constantly.\n\nThese endorphin levels are chronically elevated, which would be great, and it allows you to go through life's thinking.\n\nNo, nothing bad happened to you and you're fine.\n\nHowever, endorphins are proven to mess with the immune system.\n\nThat is a problem.\n\nSo  endorphins, the impair the production of different cells that immune  system uses to break breakdown malignant cells, detect diseases and and  whatnot.\n\nIt impairs the production of certain immune system cells and it also messes with their function.\n\nIt confuses the immune system.\n\nLiterally  the immune system is very complex and every day it's fighting cancer  cells, cleaning up dirt, it's cleaning up old cells and it's cleaning up  garbage that from your digestive system.\n\nAnd it's cleaning up cancer cells that you are basically producing every day.\n\nAnd if it stops cleaning up cancer cells, you get cancer.\n\nAnd if it gets confused about what things to fight, it might fight parts of your own body.\n\nAnd that's how you get autoimmune disorders.\n\nSo  to recap, if you've got trauma, be it physical or emotional, that means  at some point the pain level was so high that you couldn't deal with it  and you had to block it out.\n\nAnd that pain is still with you.\n\nThat pain, you're still carrying that pain, blissfully unaware that it is ever was ever there.\n\nThen your body's working all the time to keep you blissfully unaware that it was ever there.\n\nAnd  part of that work means raising the levels of endorphin in the blood so  that your level of feel-good chemicals has to be higher than a more  mental healthy person to feel normal.\n\nAnd with that chronically elevated endorphin level, the immune system is suppressed.\n\nAnd over time, after years and years, it starts working less and less well, it starts getting more and more confused.\n\nEventually  some cancer cells get undetected or eventually the immune system starts  getting confused about what's mine and not mine and it starts fighting  itself.\n\nThis  has also been very well described in the book \"When the body says no\",  that's basically why you get sick eventually after you suffer trauma.\n\nSo yes, it is actually dangerous to not deal with your trauma.\n\nSo  whether it's trauma that you incurred in a singular event or trauma  that you basically have from childhood, from lacking certain types of  care and love and attention from parents, you probably, if that's the  case, you're probably not even aware of it or maybe you have some sort  of vague memories that seem like if you think about them, yeah, maybe a  child wouldn't have liked that so much.\n\nBut  I don't remember it being very painful and I don't understand why I'm  having such neurotic thoughts or habits or weird ticks all the time or  whatever it may be, or why I'm depressed.\n\nBe it a car accident, a war or an imperfect childhood that you don't remember parts from.\n\nIf you don't deal with it, you risk your chance of getting cancer or auto autoimmune disorders and this is why.\n\nSo  I hope that inspired you to take another look at your childhood and if  there's hints of things that you don't remember so well, or if you have  other reasons to be, believe that you were neurotic and you might have  some childhood trauma, deal with it because it also massively impact  your physical health.\n\nSo thank you for reading.\n\n\\- Erik\n\n[Death By Childhood - how trauma slowly kills you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Xr0cOCgGeY)",

    "selftext": "In September I sucked it up and had two 15 minute consults with two therapists, and it was scary and difficult but also felt amazing to do. My abuser used to use telling me to go to therapy as a way of making me feel worse about myself while seeming sympathetic and putting in zero effort to help. so I've avoided it for a lot longer than I should have. It's taken me until now to actually email back the therapist I want to start seeing, but honestly I'm terrified of going. I cry super super easily, especially when talking about the abuse. Even saying the word during the consult was difficult. I know that she's a lovely woman and I'm going to be safe there but that won't make it any less difficult and part of me really just wants to run away from the whole idea and just deal with life as it is now. Honestly a big reason I'm actually doing this is because I hate to think my anxiety is a burden on my boyfriend. He's made it crystal clear that it isn't and he will always be there for me if I'm feeling bad, that he wants to help me and that he never thinks any less of me because of everything, but I still feel self conscious about it. He shouldn't have to deal with everything when I've done nothing to actually address it for myself. I know that's a bad way to think about it but hey, if it's what gets me to go to therapy then I'll take it.",

Eg it makes me very uncomfortable when people offer me something to drink when I'm at their home. There's also a feeling of that others got something I didn't, like a basic sense of physical security, and there's lot of shame for that and being singled out and alienated (this is in a wealthy Western European country). \n\nDoes anyone have a similar trauma and can relate?

    "selftext": "Imagine one of your friends is a mechanic and you‚Äôre giving them a lift somewhere in your car. You're driving along and the car starts to make a horrible screeching noise. Your friend asks how long has the car been making that noise and you say, 'it‚Äôs always like this, its just a noise the car makes.' We'd probably expect our friend to suggest that we look into it, even if we just accept it.\n\nAnd we do that with ourselves - we can identify with difficult thoughts and feelings where we think it‚Äôs part of us rather than something we‚Äôre experiencing. Because of our past experiences, because of our upbringing or because of traumas, we can have our own screeching thoughts and feelings that we‚Äôve got so used to that we literally think that it‚Äôs us. Suffering exists, but we don‚Äôt have to suffer and we can certainly reduce our suffering if we‚Äôre willing to look under the hood.\n\nThe mind is an incredible tool, like a computer or a phone, but rather than us leading it and focusing on what we want, it leads us to anxieties about the future and regrets from the past. We shouldn‚Äôt ignore this - in fact when our mind leads us there we need to notice it, acknowledge it and then bring ourselves back to the present. But our mind doesn‚Äôt have to dictate how we feel, just as a computer doesn‚Äôt tell you what to do - hopefully you tell it what you want it to do! We can do the same with our mind if we separate ourselves, if we distance ourselves from our thoughts and feelings. We can do this with a few simple trainings.\n \nFirstly is setting the intention, literally saying to yourself, ‚ÄúI am not my thoughts.‚Äù Drilling that into your head regularly will transform your experience of difficult periods - rather than being lost at sea when things get tough you can take a step back and observe your thoughts and feelings without judging or getting involved with them.\n\nSecond, you can stop feeling ashamed or punishing yourself for having thoughts and feelings and give yourself permission to not be OK. For a long time I felt ashamed about the anxiety I felt - but that reaction was actually more harmful and more destructive than the anxiety. Letting go of that impulse to berate myself meant that I could say that it‚Äôs OK to feel anxious. Its OK to feel sad. You can label thoughts without judgement rather than react to them - that's an anxious thought, that's a happy thought, that's a planning thought.\n\nThe last suggestion is training ourselves to decouple difficult feelings from reactive action. Its OK to feel angry as long as that doesn‚Äôt lead to reactions that harm others. Its too easy for us to say, \"well that's just what I‚Äôm like, I‚Äôve got a fiery personality.\" We can work on noticing thoughts and feelings as they arise, being less reactive and stopping, breathing before doing anything when we‚Äôre aware we‚Äôre in a heightened state. Know your stress behaviours, know your stress triggers and practice walking away from them. \n\n[Listen On Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/free-your-mind-i-think-therefore-i-am-lost/id1493806566?i=1000541631881)\n\n[Listen On Google Podcasts](https://www.google.com/podcasts?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9hbmNob3IuZm0vcy8xMjNkZThlMC9wb2RjYXN0L3Jzcw==)\n\n[Listen On Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/1ozwIEgzEtHQezPoi83nVV)\n\n[Other ways to listen](https://anchor.fm/shaun-donaghy/episodes/Free-your-mind-I-think-therefore-I-am-lost-e1a6bua)",

    "selftext": "It‚Äôs easy to worry these days, it feels like we live in anxious times. There‚Äôs big things like health, work, school or money but there‚Äôs lots of little stresses that pop up like worrying someone might be annoyed at you or being late. The happiness and joy in our life can pass us by because our minds are stuck in the future, worrying about what might happen.\n\nFixating on worries can be a symptom of poor general wellbeing, so give yourself a mental health check up - your sleep pattern is key to this but it‚Äôs helpful to make a list of daily activities that help you to maintain your peace - meditation, exercise, yoga, creative activities, reading, socialising, going for a walk in nature - whatever wholesome activities suit you. Being aware of the things that disrupt your mental health is also important - caffeine used to drive my worrying but alcohol, TV, news and social media can also have an impact. \n\nThe point is not to tell you what to do or what to consume. The point is that bringing awareness to what you consume allows you to monitor the effect that food, media and experiences have on you and enables you to make informed choices. Setting up a good mental health routine and sticking to it will make a huge difference with worrying.\n\nThe second part is being present with what you‚Äôre experiencing. When you have a worrying thought, notice it arising and sit with it for a moment, listen to it. When we see our difficult emotions as friends rather than enemies and tend to them with compassion we take away their power over us, they no longer can control our behaviours. We can breathe and allow the worrying thought to pass without acting on it, without being swept away by it. We can smile to our anxiety and smile to our difficulties.\n\nThe final way to tend to our worrying to to look deeply into it. Our reaction when worries are coming up is to barricade the door and try and shut it out but it‚Äôs an opportunity for us to find out why we react the way we do and find out where the root of our fear lies. Most of the time, our fear lies in deeply held assumptions or beliefs, created by experiences from the past. When we shine the light of compassion and awareness onto that assumption, we can ask ourselves whether it‚Äôs really true. Taking the time to explore with kindness the parts of ourselves that live in the dark is how we liberate ourselves from suffering. \n\n[Listen On Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/how-to-stop-worrying-and-enjoy-life/id1493806566?i=1000512820294)\n\n[Listen On Google Podcasts](https://www.google.com/podcasts?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9hbmNob3IuZm0vcy8xMjNkZThlMC9wb2RjYXN0L3Jzcw==)\n\n[Listen On Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/1ozwIEgzEtHQezPoi83nVV)\n\n[Other ways to listen](https://anchor.fm/shaun-donaghy/episodes/How-to-stop-worrying-and-enjoy-life-esdks9)",

    "selftext": "Starting your day off well doesn‚Äôt involve a huge amount of rocket science but it does need a bit of patience and persistence. The key thing is setting up new habits and sticking to them every day, even on the weekend. The most important of these is your sleep hygiene.\n\nThe temptation is to use the weekend for a lie in, but if you‚Äôre like me and occasionally get insomnia the answer is to have a set time for going to bed and getting up. Getting into a rhythm in this way means that your body is ready for sleep at bedtime and is ready to rise in the morning. It‚Äôs also helpful to avoid the things that interfere with your sleep like alcohol and particularly caffeine - most of my insomnia (and anxiety) was caused by my coffee habit.\n\nFor the same reason its a good idea to keep mobiles and laptops out of the bedroom, they interfere with sleep and they also make it more difficult to get out of bed. Starting your morning with social media, which is designed to get a reaction from us, doesn‚Äôt set you up well for the day.\n\nOn to your morning routine - some activity as soon as as you get up is helpful. Whether you‚Äôre doing stretching, movement or yoga focus your awareness on your breath and what you can feel in your body rather than whats coming up in your day.\n\nYou can then sit for a guided meditation, morning is a great time to practice gratitude. Its the one trait that happy people have in common and its vital for cultivating our happiness, especially in the morning when our mind is in a suggestible state. \n\nFinally, you can practice mindful drinking and mindful eating with breakfast, paying all of your attention to each mouthful of food, being aware of the smell, texture and flavours, eating slowly and putting the spoon down between bites. Keeping in mind everything that went into it as you eat is another way to integrate gratitude into the start of your day.\n\n[Listen On Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/start-your-morning-with-mindful-energy/id1493806566?i=1000511840638)\n\n[Listen On Google Podcasts](https://www.google.com/podcasts?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9hbmNob3IuZm0vcy8xMjNkZThlMC9wb2RjYXN0L3Jzcw==)\n\n[Listen On Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/1ozwIEgzEtHQezPoi83nVV)\n\n[Other ways to listen](https://anchor.fm/shaun-donaghy/episodes/Start-your-morning-with-mindful-energy-erp2ni)",

    "selftext": " \n                                                                    \n \nGrieving is not something to be avoided, or feared.  It's here to help you and I'll explain how and why in this post.\n \n \nGrieving and trauma go hand and hand.  Grieving is the built in mechanism in the human system to avoid lasting trauma to the system.\n \nTrauma is an unavoidable reality of this life.  The human being is a created object through which life moves and functions in order to bring about whatever actions are necessary at any moment.  The experience of trauma arises in a human being when circumstances outside the human being's control result in a system overload that can not be properly processed and released.  It's more accurate here, and probably more helpful, to refer to the human being as the human system.  See, the human system is an INCREDIBLY complex bio feedback system, constantly analyzing it's environment in millions of ways to determine appropriate output responses based on the feedback it receives.  When the human system experiences a circumstance that overwhelms that system based on it's current mental, emotional and physical status at that moment, it kicks in the emergency response switch (trauma response) in order to save the entire system.  The traumatic moment is logged as a memory in the system (not just mentally but emotionally and physiologically as well) so that if similar circumstances arise again, it can be prepared to defend itself at all costs. \n \nThis is where Grieving comes in. \n \nGrieving functions as the mechanism through which the overload to the system (the trauma) is processed and released.  The Grieving is a natural, energetic response to prevent the system from being forced to store excess negative energy that may later cause disease and decay to the body and brain.  Grieving must be allowed to take it's natural course in order for this negative energy put into the system NOT to be stored and unprocessed.  When Grieving is not allowed to take it's natural course, it turns into GRIEF.  GRIEF represents the static, unprocessed energy in the human system when Grieving did not take place.  Let's talk about Zebra's here:\n \nWhen Zebra's are under attack by a pride of lions, they flee, as they've evolved to use their great speed to evade predators like the lions who are seeking to kill and eat them.  When a dazzle of zebras (the name given to multiple zebras living as a pack) experiences a life or death chase with a pride of lions, this is an extremely traumatic event for the zebra.  When the zebras have reached a safe place and are no longer threatened by the lions, the entire dazzel proceeds to shake their whole bodies violently for a period of time.  When the shaking is over, they go on about their day and continue foraging for food.  This is nature's built in healing mechanism for the zebra in order for them to excise the excess traumatic energy put in their system by the encounter with the lions.\n \nGrieving was always meant to function in the same way for the human being.  The physical and emotional act of grieving releases the excess traumatic energy in the human system from traumatic events.  In the future, I will be writing more acticles about the importance of grieving for human beings and particularly for parents to allow their children to practice the healthy habit of grieving in their daily lives.\n \nNamaste.",

    "selftext": "For the longest time I‚Äôve always felt like something happened to me a long time ago. There were many things that happened to me, but I remembered those. They didn‚Äôt feel like the beginning. I have a lot of trauma, I was physically and psychologically abused as a child, emotionally neglected, there was a lot of domestic violence between my parents resulting in police officers showing up often, absent father, I‚Äôve been bullied, and sexual assaulted around 2-3 times. I‚Äôve been through a lot, but something still didn‚Äôt sit right with me. It makes sense why I wouldn‚Äôt remember my childhood so much. \n\nBut... yesterday something happened to me that shook me to my core. I tried shrooms for the second time and it was a fun experience. I was dancing and laughing. When i decided to lay down I got this weird feeling. I kept seeing this little girl under a huge truck. I didn‚Äôt know her at first I was very confused. Then my leg started hurting really bad. I suddenly felt like I knew her, I met her before. I know her, but I couldnt remember who she is, but I swear she felt so familiar. I wondered if she was my friend. I was told I use to make friends everywhere I went. I‚Äôm thinking about her when suddenly it happens. I see his face. I didn‚Äôt know who he was. But I felt like I knew him too. Was he my friend? He was much older and bigger. He looked like her sister. My friends thought maybe it was a past life kind of memory. But it was so strong that I knew him. I laid down again when it hit me. I did know him, it washed over me like a feeling. He was the one who raped me as a child, where everything started, the root where my trauma began. I could feel the memory banging on the door along with other memories of that year it occurred I use to not be able to access. But I remember now I use to love Nancy Drew and drawing comics. It came over me and I started balling. I could feel the memory creeping in and I couldn‚Äôt handle it. I almost relived it, I held the benzo in my hand to take, but at the same time I wanted to ride it out: I wanted to understand. He got clearer and clearer and suddenly I was inconsolable. My friends were so confused and even one kinda upset I was crying so loud bc we were outside but I had to purge. I had to cry. I could almost feel him. I saw one of the things he wanted me to do. I almost felt it and I couldn‚Äôt take it. But my other friend was holding me as I cried which helped bc it was so much at once. When I stood up my mind tried to tell me it didn‚Äôt happen, but when I said outloud he raped me as a child. I felt like my reality shifted and I no longer saw life the same. It felt real. It felt like I‚Äôve been denying reality for years living a lie; outside of my truth. Something changed inside me. How I viewed others changed, how I viewed my self shifted, everything began to fall into place it felt like. I felt for a moment I was truly myself again. Almost like a recognition of some part of me or somethin was recovered. I started to remember more of my childhood. The rest of the night I had to push down the memory. I wasn‚Äôt ready to handle it. Especially in front of people who didn‚Äôt understand bc it was personal or help me bc we were all high as fuck. My leg hurt so much and my arm, I think this might be where the trauma is stored. The thing is I don‚Äôt know what to do now or where to go with this. I‚Äôm blanked. How do I heal. I think I feel like I‚Äôm ready I‚Äôve already done a lot of work on other stuff, but how do I tell ppl like my therapist. How does a conversation even take place.\n\nOne of the biggest struggles I face is living in the reality. It seems I can only manage to stay in the one where I tell myself it didn‚Äôt happen. Trying to enter the other becomes too overwhelming.",

My son is attributing his trauma symptoms to what he went through with his father, but mentioned that he thinks that there are things that happened to him before he could remember. Nobody has told him this, but he was abandoned by me when he was an infant, and when I came back about a year later, he then lost his dad for a few years during the time he was a toddler. \n\nMy question is this: should I tell him what happened to him? Would it be beneficial or more harmful to him? \n\nResearch shows that emotional disturbance is significant for babies, as it is the time that they learn to form relationships and regulate emotion. I truly believe this is true, as my son is clear evidence with an inability to make close friends his whole life, and a lack of empathy a lot of the time. There are many more problems in his life and soul that I cannot summarize in a short post.\n\nI understand that I really messed up and I would appreciate your grace when responding to this post.

Recently, when many big life changes occurred at the same time he went back to therapy. After the second session, he completely freaked out. Started screaming, was so angry, angry at me. Said he couldn't trust me and that he wasn't emotionally safe with me and therefore never wanted to have kids with me (obvs kids are off the table right now). He started bringing up things from our past, instances over the last 7+ years when I'd gotten mad at him and has - in my opinion - warped those instances so that I had been some kind of bully. For the record, both my individual and EMDR therapist as well as our couples therapist has assured me this isn't the case. My individual therapists have told me not to take this personally and when I recount the details of his accusation they say they're confident he's projecting his trauma onto me.   \n\n\nIt's been going on for four months and in hindsight - I think it's played an unhealthy role throughout our entire relationship. But nothing like this. He now keeps threatening to end the relationship but always backtracks. I've asked him if he wants me just to leave so he can work on himself and he says no. He contradicts himself constantly for example today after he started to get very cold suddenly he said, \"Emotionally I'm leaning towards us separating but I'm 100% committed to working on things and I'm very confident that I can get over this. I love you 100%, more than you can know. But I also don't feel emotionally safe with you. I don't trust that you won't revert back to how you were and hurt me. I'm still very hurt from before\".   \n\n\nI don't know how to respond to this because I truly do not believe I've done anything like what he is accusing me of. He says he doesn't know how to move forward or forgive but he's committed to working things out.   \n\n\nIs this normal? The therapist say this big personality change/defensiveness/lack of trust/self destruction is not uncommon when people try to work on their trauma. If so, how long with this phase of it last? I understand this will be a lifelong thing to work through but the part where he's blaming me - the coldness, being emotionally withdrawn, blaming me....how long will that last?   \n\n\nWe've been together for 7+ years. I love him but I'm so overwhelmed, heartbroken, and drained. What do I do?",

I threw my helmet and went over to a woman on the ground and pleaded for a response. Not knowing if the motorcycle was still a threat I faced my back towards the fire to shield her. I wanted to move her away, but I didn‚Äôt out of fear of hurting her further. She had lifted her head up in response to me for maybe a full second and I was just happy she was alive. The cops arrived maybe 10 minutes later, pretty quick. I just don‚Äôt know how to deal with this. I stayed strong for my friends, and I acted like it didn‚Äôt effect me at all.

    "selftext": "I (M23), is soon graduating from college with a 4.0 GPA and I have to go back and stay at my parents for a while before I start my next endeavor. However, that is the issue.\n\nA little background about me and my family, I am the second child and got into an accident when I was 5/6 yo and that left me with permanent paralysis in my right hand and leg but it is not so bad that I cannot use them for everyday things. Because of this, I was always ostracized and scolded by my father whenever he got the chance to ever since I can remember and he have been a hypocrite ever since. I can't even remember a time I was treated as well as my brothers. At first, i thought I was the one in the wrong and tried to do everything I could to please him but to no avail. It got even worse when I was in high school even though I was doing pretty well in school as I was always at the top of my class. I even ranked pretty high (top 5 nationally) in the national exam and hoped that my parents would be happy and proud of me but boy I was wrong. It was treated as if my achievement wasn't there at all. What hurts me more is that three years before I did that exam, my older brother (the golden child of the family) had a pretty decent grade in that exam and my father was very elated and proud of him even though my grades were way, way better than his. It all went downhill from there.\n\nHowever, I thought that everything was going to change when I go off to college but wait, that was when everything came crashing down. I had good grades to pursue a medical degree, however, after the ones who were offering the scholarship knew that I had paralysis, I was not offered the scholarship and told to try in a different field. It was literally everything I wanted, everything I studied for and everything I endured for. Luckily, I got another scholarship offer (not as good as the first option which I could have gotten with a pretty decent grade) to study out of the country. I was literally at my lowest at this point and I don't even know how many days I have been depressed. Instead of helping me through this, I didn't even get a shred of consolation from my family. It was a downward spiral ever since and because of that, I was not able to trust anyone other than myself or form any meaningful connection with the people around. I was just a living husk at this point as being physically impaired wasn't enough that I was mentally hurt as well.\n\nNow, it's been around 4 years and I thought I was over everything that happened and that ready to start anew but that wasn't the case. I have sleepless nights due to all the nightmares of the past haunting me. I honestly don't know what to do anymore, I don't have anyone to talk to. I've never felt so alone in this world. I wish I could just leave everything behind.",

    "title": "Finally going no contact with my Mom",
    "selftext": "TW: SA, suicide\n\nI'm 31, When I was 12 stepdad (52ish currently) gave me alcohol and kissed me saying he was \"making sure I knew how before I dated anyone\". For most of my life I didn't know what to consider but looking back, I would consider it sexual assault. He robbed me of my first kiss. \nWhen I told my mom maybe a few days after it happened she took me and him to eat at Arby's and had him apologize and that was the last anyone spoke of it for 15 years until I got married and asked her not to bring him, had to explain why all over again and he came anyway. He also came uninvited to my daughter's birthday party. \n\nMy step sister(28) who is his daughter, and I were close growing up but she never knew what he did to me. We also have another 12 year old sister still living under his roof and a cousin of the same age who frequently stays over and I think they all deserve to know what happened so they can protect themselves because I don't trust my mom to do that. I feel like both of my sisters deserve to know what behavior he's capable of because I don't know if my incident was the only one and I'm ashamed of my mom for continuing to let me and other young girls in our family around them. \n\nA couple days ago my sister asked me to get together with her and take our mom out for mother's day and I nervously told her that I was focusing on my mental health and that celebrating mom wasn't something I could do right now, she immediately understood and didn't ask any further questions. That's the most I've opened up to anyone in our family about it. I'm sure my mom expects that I will never tell my sister but I just can't continue putting myself around him and especially not now that I have a daughter of my own to protect and my sister does as well.\nEvery time any holiday comes up I have to deal with figuring out how to avoid him. Even when I tell him not to come, she brings him. I can't keep doing it. \n\nI thought I would write her a paper letter explaining why I've been distancing myself from her and call out some of the ways I know she never took my pain seriously.  Like telling me she divorced him because of what he did to me even though literally 6 years had passed and I was no longer and it was actually because he cheated on her and then she just got back together with him later anyway and still is now. When I attempted suicide two different times she had him take off the door to my room to \"keep an eye on me\" but all it did was strip me of all my privacy and integrand he could look into my room anytime he wanted, I had to change clothes in the fucking bathroom. She's had 20 years to at least attempt understanding how much what maybe seemed like \"just a kiss\"ü§Æ to her and instead she brings him around me uninvited over and over when I've made it clear that he makes me uncomfortable and I don't want to see him. \n\nI am just not sure how to tell my sisters. The older sister (28) is one of the most level headed and understanding people I think I've ever known but I know it will be hard for her to learn and I can only hope it won't destroy our relationship. She talks to our younger sister (12) much more than I do so I was thinking we could tell her together if all goes well or but I don't know that it will.",

    "title": "I can‚Äôt access intimacy the way my partner needs me to and it‚Äôs causing resentment. This is spilling into other areas of our relationship, and I don‚Äôt know what to do or who to turn to (TRIGGER WARNING: sexual assault and childhood trauma)",
    "selftext": "I was raised by abuse parents and most of my childhood was punctuated by a pronounced fear on many levels. I was always afraid of being too relaxed or comfortable because the violence was sporadic and unpredictable. I would sometimes be woken by being beaten. I felt unsafe. I was also repressing my identity as a queer person for fear of exacerbating the abuse because of my parents‚Äô homophobia. I never felt in control of myself, my body, my feelings, anything. \n\nI escaped in my late teens and set to the task of healing. I wanted to be free to trust and to love and finally feel comfortable. \n\nIn my early twenties I was drugged and raped and left unconscious in a parking lot. To say this set me back on my journey of healing is an understatement. I was back in that place where I was not in control. I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to be sexually intimate, or even hug or be hugged by friends, simply shake hands, I would spiral into crisis if a cashier brushed my hand accidentally while giving me change. This went on for years until I started talking about it. It‚Äôs only been a couple of years since I started being able to stand being touched again. \n\nNow I‚Äôm in a relationship. This is the first time, the first relationship, where instead of casually glossing over my past (a harmful technique I used in the past to insulate and protect myself in an effort to have a relationship not based around the understanding of my trauma) I am open and honest with my partner. I have shared my experiences and trusted this person so that they can understand my potential triggers, or why sometimes I have difficulties, or how to recognize ways in which I may need them to be gentle. \nWhen it comes to sexual intimacy, I still have trouble sometimes getting myself to the place where I even want to engage. I need to feel comfortable and safe and loved and no pressure. But sometimes it seems to me that my partner is placing their physical needs above my emotional ones and can be unintentionally insensitive. \n\nYesterday we had an amazing day. We stayed in bed and listened to radio broadcasts, and talked at length, and laughed with one another and I felt that security that‚Äôs know I need. I felt secure, happy, comfortable, and began feeling aroused when we held each other. They wanted to have sex, but I had to go to work so we agreed to resume later. But when I got home, I could feel that they were expectant, and against my best intentions I was immediately on guard. They told me that they had been feeling unsettled because of pent up sexual tension all day, and they were unable to guide me to a place where I could genuinely feel and reciprocate the sexual energy without feeling like it was performance or just to take care of their immediate need regardless of how I felt. It felt like they didn‚Äôt understand that even though I wanted to engage them sexually, I still needed the building of intimacy in order to get to the point where I could actually have sex. They were frustrated and unkind and made accusations about my being manipulative when I asked them to just lay with me and hold me a bit. It turned into this ordeal that ended with us going to sleep hurt and angry and in separate beds. \n\nI don‚Äôt know what to do. I want to be able to satisfy my partner‚Äôs every needs, emotional and physical. But I want to feel a mutual sense of being taken care of. I don‚Äôt know how to compartmentalize these feelings (I don‚Äôt think doing so would be healthy), and I wish my partner would understand my needs based upon the truths I‚Äôve shared. It‚Äôs getting to the point where my partner feels undesired by me and unloved, and I don‚Äôt know how to help them understand that it‚Äôs not the case. I feel like if we can‚Äôt come to an understanding then our relationship will dissolve, and I really don‚Äôt want that. \n\nI don‚Äôt know what to do.",

    "title": "Am I Overreacting? TW: SEX",
    "selftext": "I recently had to admit myself to urgent care due to unimaginable vaginal pain. I had sex with my boyfriend (completely consensual) but realized afterward it hurt. For the next few days I was in constant pain and discomfort, and admitted myself to urgent care out of desperation for relief. \n\nInitially, I had believed I had endured a vaginal tear, so that‚Äôs what I went in for. I explained this to the nurse who brought me into the examination room. \n\nNext thing I know, a male physician comes into the room. He immediately says ‚Äúso, you had sex and sex and sex after not seeing your boyfriend for a while and now you‚Äôre in pain?‚Äù I was immediately uncomfortable. ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúI only had sex with him once, and couldn‚Äôt afterward, because of the pain.‚Äù His next question was ‚Äúwere you raped?‚Äù to which I responded ‚Äúno.‚Äù He then proceeded to say ‚Äúare you sure? you were expecting it?‚Äù I assured him the encounter was completely consensual and that I had zero fears of my partner taking advantage of me. ‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt seem like it.‚Äù He responded. ‚ÄúGet undressed, you‚Äôre gonna need a pelvic.‚Äù He then left the room. \n\nI‚Äôm only 20 years old. I‚Äôve never had a pelvic exam (I have been tested for STD‚Äôs, but it was along the lines of urine samples and blood work) and have never had any sort of examination/medical concern on my genitalia. But... I undressed, and waited for him to come back. \n\nWhen he came back in, he instructed me to lay back and elevate my legs. I did as I was told, although I was extremely nervous as 1. I was receiving a pelvic exam from a man that wasn‚Äôt a certified OB/GYN, 2. I was in immense pain as it was, and wasn‚Äôt sure what was about to take place, 3. Another medical official did not accompany the physician in the room. \n\nThen, without even asking if I was ready or informing me on what he was about to do, he shoves the clamping device inside of me. I immediately began sobbing as it was extremely painful. He kept telling me to relax, yet continued to enlarge the clamp inside of me despite being in obvious distress and pain. It was the most painful thing I‚Äôve ever experienced. I started seeing stars, felt nauseous, and was shaking. I was uncontrollably sobbing. Not once did the physician ask me ‚Äúare you okay?‚Äù or ‚Äúdo you need me to stop?‚Äù or ‚Äúwhere does it hurt?‚Äù, but instead continued to aggressively move the device inside of me while looking and acting increasingly frustrated. \n\nFinally, he pulled the clamp out. I thought this experience was finally over, but to my surprise, he then shoved his entire hand inside of me. I‚Äôm talking wrist deep, at least. Again, I was back to being in excruciating pain. He was twisting his hand inside of me while pressing on my stomach with the other. Again, made no effort to inform me on what he was attempting to do. Finally, after what seemed like hours, he pulled his hand out. \n\n‚ÄúI can‚Äôt get any accurate result with you tense like this,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúGet dressed.‚Äù He then left the room. \n\nI was so shocked by what had just happened. It took me several minutes to even find the courage to sit up. Once I did, I looked down to see blood covering the inside of my thighs/the table. This sent me into another spell of panic, and I had to collect myself all over again before I could even attempt to stand up. Once I did, getting dressed was extremely painful, on top of cleaning all of the blood. \n\nOnce I was finally decent, he came back into the room. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with you, but you‚Äôre obviously very uncomfortable, so I‚Äôm going to prescribe you some pain killers. If it still hurts in two days, get it checked out again, but don‚Äôt come here.‚Äù \n\nHe left the room again. Still coming to terms with what was just done/said to me, I left the office in tears, but still managed to say ‚Äúthank you‚Äù on my way out. Everyone in the office, including the physician, just stared at me. I felt so ashamed. I almost felt guilty for being in pain. \n\nI went to an official OB/GYN two days later. When asked to describe my encounter at urgent care, I immediately started crying. The nurses assured me they wouldn‚Äôt give me a pelvic, as they could tell my last experience was traumatic. \n\nWhen the OB/GYN came in, she immediately noticed something abnormal the moment I spread my legs. She didn‚Äôt even need to give me a pelvic, as she could see the cyst in plain sight. ‚ÄúThat doctor was an idiot,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even need to look inside you to see this.‚Äù I then found out that I did in fact have a vaginal tear accompanied by a cyst, but to nobody‚Äôs surprise, the previous physician I saw increased the severity of my tear, irritated my cyst, and prescribed me medication that would do little to nothing to help me heal. \n\nI still haven‚Äôt come to terms with everything that happened, and constantly wonder if I‚Äôm overreacting. I haven‚Äôt confided in anyone besides the nurses & OB/GYN that I saw, but this is weighing on me heavy. Has anyone else experienced this type of thing? Is this borderline malpractice? Was this all just one big misunderstanding? I have therapy next week where I plan to talk about this, but until then I needed to get it off my chest. The physical pain I feel every day is a constant reminder of the nightmare I experienced in that office. \n\nSorry this is so long. :/",

Gross  I'm in the basement and there aren't many windows so I did a deep clean, set up some fly tape and bought a few swatters/ \n\nThe infestation is mostly gone, the tape and cleaning did the wonders - but as I just went to go swat a fly, I remembered something. \n\nMe, and my 2 brothers, as children, counting fly corpses on the wall and my Mom paying us for each one. As I grew older, I realized that we were very poor and had been living in squalor and poverty, but things got much better when we were teenagers as both of my parents got better jobs - but I had sudden memory of that. \n\nWe had really bad fly and roach infestations as kids. I remember when my Mom brought home fly swatters and turned it into a game. Each fly was worth a nickle and I remember me and my younger brother even arguing over a few on whether or not he killed it or I killed it. I have this one small memory after a successful hunt and my father giving us each a dollar and my mother crying as she was washing the walls. I remember being confused on why she was crying - it was a really successful hunt. And only now do I realize to a 24 year old mother with 3 kids, at how horrible it must have felt, and at how her and my 23 year old Dad turned it into a game to protect us. \n\nAnd here I am . looking at half-filled fly traps with a deep disgust of myself and of my situation and the horror of taking joy in \"murdering something\" and the horrible way flies make me feel - all because of that memory. \n\nAint trauma a real bitch? anyone else have strange trauma triggers like this?",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone, I want to start by saying this is super embarrassing because I‚Äôm sure a lot of the people‚Äôs trauma is different than this and my biggest fear is being invalidated üôÉ I hold a lot of shame around it about not being believed. Please let me know if this post isn‚Äôt appropriate for this thread. Here goes.\n\nI‚Äôve never written in the sub before. I‚Äôm (24F) seeking advice. I was wrongfully sectioned when I was not suicidal in September 2020. When I told the ER I would not agree to a 72 hour hold because I wasn‚Äôt a danger, and that I was going to walk out of the hospital and go home.\n\nI tried to walk out of the ER. I was thrown onto the ground, restrained by probably eight men and thrown onto a bed, tied at my wrists and my ankles, and given an injection in my left thigh. (What I learned later was haldol.) I laid in a dark room, flat on my back.  They came in and gave me another injection. I was coughing and choking as I felt the taste of the Haldol coming up my throat. I genuinely thought I would die. I‚Äôm an extremely small person, and when I woke up 16 hours later, I threw up so much that I lost 9 pounds. It was basically the most traumatic situation of my life which I didn‚Äôt think was possible because I have PTSD as it is. \n\nIt may sound ignorant, but I literally did not know that they did this to people.\n\nBackground: I have not been suicidal since I was 16 years old. Ironically, I work at an office as a therapeutic mentor and a yoga teacher inspiring others about mental health. I‚Äôm happy to explain how I ended up at the ER wrongfully, but genuinely don‚Äôt even know if it matters because the only reason I‚Äôm on here is to figure out if you can actually heal from this. What are the ACTUAL methods? I‚Äôm being told I have to let go of fear and anger because it‚Äôs a protection mechanism and that I need to have acceptance of it but how do you accept that type of legal violence?\n\nWhen I Google it there‚Äôs tons of information of how harmful restraints and forced sedation is to people but there are no coping skills or treatment. I currently do EMDR but reliving the situation over and over can‚Äôt be the only way. Please advise if you have some thing that works for a violent PTSD event or some thing you have heard of. I have flashbacks everyday.\n\nü§ç",

Needless to say it was a big surprise. It was thrown so hard it got through double glazing, pulled heavy curtains off the rail to travel further, and landed only a foot or so from hitting me.\n\nI was too scared to let my boyfriend go outside for a moment, as it seemed so personal and hateful a thing to do I was thinking I was in The Strangers horror move or someone outside might want to hut us. After a moment I decided I would not let fear influence my life and went out myself.\n\nWe checked the neighbours CCTV and it turned out to ‚Äòonly‚Äô be teenagers who seemed to have chosen our window on a whim as a Halloween prank. The police didn‚Äôt think it worth coming. Then the group came back and threw a stone at the board we‚Äôd put over the window. Most ran off but a girl who I was told later was part of the second group spoke to me and asked what had happened and if anyone was hurt. She was just a normal teenage kid.\n\nI‚Äôve had a lot of bigger trauma in my life, and grew up in a place I didn‚Äôt feel safe, and have coped relatively well. However I no longer feel safe sitting in the front room and want to move house. The fact the police then told us they had a car in the next street over, (the rich houses) and could have picked them up if they wanted to, but let them feel they could come back with no repercussions, makes me feel more of a victim - and the fact they were only kids but they really scared me and I was worried they might think it funny to keep coming back.\n\nA firework went off outside yesterday and before my reason kicked in I was petrified, thinking someone was shooting at my bedroom window or another brick was going to come through. Afterwards I just felt like crying. It‚Äôs bonfire night tonight and I don‚Äôt want to end up jumpy all the time.\n\nOn the surface it sounds silly - kids threw a brick at the window and now I‚Äôm scared - but I feel quite traumatised about it.\n\nI don‚Äôt really have a question I just wondered if anyone had any advice or had similar experience?",

I've been trying to find other ways of coping on my own, but the usual suggestions of exercise and mindfulness don't really work for me because I also have a very painful physical disability; music doesn't work because I'm tone deaf; and writing and going outside are also two of my triggers. It's really hard to find other ways around it, that don't involve social interactions (also not an option because, again, autism), but the flashbacks, meltdowns, and overall depression are getting very difficult to live with, so, like... does anyone know of any more offbeat ways of dealing with it? \nThank you for reading, and sorry again to bother you!",

These are all experiences that would be widely regarded as \"traumatic,\" and yet I never looked at them that way. I have always sort of laughed these things off. I would joke around with my friends about the molestation incident. I would laugh with mom when we remember my various childhood experiences, including the traumatic parts. I still love my mother to this day and do not feel any anger or resentment for what had happened in the past. It's just that I do not know what to make of these negative memories, I often think back about them, but I can't say that any of them really haunt me, even if that may come as a surprise to a lot of people. Can this even be considered trauma?

    "title": "Healing Trauma, Post #1 Taking Radical Responsibility",
    "selftext": "This is the first of many posts on a series I'm calling \"Healing Trauma, the basics\".  Some of these posts will give specific advice for things to do in your daily life and others will simply introduce healing mindsets.\n\n\n#1 Take radical responsibility\n\n\nThis is the first post of the series because I see it as being vital to healing from trauma.  First of all, from my perspective, everyone is traumatized - narcissistic and/ or abusive parents / relationships, childhood abuse, cruel words and actions from peers growing up, and even any, yes literally any, unresolved emotions.  There are degrees to trauma but the point here is that everyone gets traumatized. So let's start with my definition of what trauma is.  \n\n\nI say that when a human being experiences a circumstance that overwhelms their mind-body system based on the current mental, emotional and physical status at that moment, their system kicks in the emergency response switch (trauma response) in order to save the entire system.  The traumatic moment is logged as a memory in the system (not just mentally but emotionally and physiologically as well) so that if similar circumstances arise again, it can be prepared to defend itself at all costs (think trigger here).  So the main takeaway here is that all trauma results in a loss of personal power.  As part of the journey for a human being from traumatized to healed, that power needs to be taken back.  So who will take this power back?  You will.  You will do this by taking radical responsibility for EVERYTHING in your life, and I mean EVERYTHING.  This is absolutely KEY to your healing. \n\n\nSo what is radical responsibility? \n\n\nFirst of all, it is NOT blame.  Blame won't get you healed.  In fact, blame is actually PREVENTING you from healing.  Blame is a conditioned response.  While you're blaming, you're NOT growing and NOT healing.  Responsability actually means that you ARE able to respond.  See that you cannot control others, nor can you control circumstances or outcomes, and so often you can't even control your own emotional reactions, but you can at least observe all of these.  That IS your power.  The power of observation. See that the 1 thing you ARE able to do in this world is watch it all.  Yes, you can even watch yourself.  This is huge.  Power was taken from you.  You weren't loved and accepted the way you ought to have been but you can't change any of that.  Take your power back by seeing that you are always able to respond.  You respond by observing it all.  In order to grow and change, we first must observe.  Observation IS learning.  Learning IS growing.  And growing IS healing.  \n\n\nNow for part 2 - turning inward :) \n\n\n\nFor anyone interested, my posts can also be found on my website - divinehumanity.org   I regularly post videos on youtube and also offer private sessions.  I've been a teacher for 12 years and also offer services as a spiritual and healing mentor.",

    "selftext": "A mod at /r/rapecounseling suggested that I post how I made my own weighted blanket. It's pretty low cost, especially compared to buying one. And you can customize it any way you want.\n\nSupplies:\n\n* a flat sheet\n\n* [glass pebbles](https://www.hobbylobby.com/Floral-Wedding/Containers-Fillers/Fillers/Iridescent-Clear-Decorative-Oval-Glass-Gems---35mm/p/3510?gclid=Cj0KCQjwi43oBRDBARIsAExSRQEDgZ8t952A6JZ1byMAI4BskX0Ox8kTkL-x5eW7n1XSCSPd5h9LhGwaAljEEALw_wcB) - link for visual ONLY, please buy them for so much cheaper at pretty much any dollar store\n\n* fabric glue \n\nDirections:\n\n* Iron the flat sheet in half so you have a clear dividing line\n\n* Open the sheet up and deem one half the bottom half. Lay this half out flat\n\n* For the first row: Measure 1.5-2 inches out from the ironed line on bottom half. You can mark this with a pencil if you want. Then, divide the row into sections (I did squares with one pebble per square). Trace each section with glue and place pebbles into them. \n\n* Fold the top half of the sheet onto glue, lined up very carefully. Press into place. \n\n* Repeat making rows until you get to the outer edges of the sheet. Make sure to glue the edges along both sides and at the top together. \n\nTips:\n\n* If you're working on carpet, put a plastic tarp/sheeting down under your work area. Fabric glue can leak through the bottom of the sheet if you're not careful\n\n* Only glue up to 5 rows at a time. This is where it gets really time-heavy. You should wait for a few rows to dry before making more.\n\n* This is going to be very hard to wash besides spot cleaning, so you can make a cover out of another sheet if you want. I used washable velcro to attach the weighted section to the inside of the cover, and sew in snaps to keep the cover around the weighted section. I wouldn't use magnets, because unless you have a washer that can do a no spin, only cold cyle, you're going to de-magnetize the magnets and possibly ruin the washer.\n\nHope this is helpful!",

    "selftext": "I had just gotten out of a relationship and had a close boy best friend that was by my side the entire time. For privacy reasons I‚Äôll call him josh. Josh was a very quiet person and was really only open to me and a few close friends. While I was getting over my passed relationship I grew fond over josh and started to have a crush on him, I tried to delay these feelings thinking they were just rebound feelings since my break up was quite recent. A few days later josh admits to having feelings for me and wants us to continue in a relationship. I agree. It was probably too fast and I look back and I should‚Äôve had more thought on who I was choosing to be vulnerable to. The first few months with josh were probably the best months I had in a long time. He was very sweet and we went on a lot of ‚Äúdiy‚Äù dates. Money was an issue back then so the dates would just be us going for a picnic or a long walk. I never complained though. \n\nWe get up to being 4 months together and now public with our relationship however I got ridiculed by a lot of my friends saying that I was too out of his league. I obviously defended my relationship and distanced my self from my friends. Once josh had heard what other people think about our relationship he began to get possessive and take my phone for days or weeks on end and will only let me have it to message family members. He would block only men on my Snapchat, insta, Facebook and even Tiktok. He would give me a big lecture on why it was ok to do this and it would only be for a short time until he can prove that I wasn‚Äôt cheating or talking to anyone else.\n\nI started to notice his bad behaviours quick after that. He would get mad at me easily for something that could‚Äôve been resolved in an ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù or ‚Äúit‚Äôs ok‚Äù instead I would get yelled, or screamed at. He would constantly make me stop seeing my friends and only make me see him. Slowly my social circle everyday was him. I‚Äôm the same house. Doing nothing but getting screamed and shouted and belittled. I cried every night thinking I was too far into this relationship that I can‚Äôt get out. He would rape me if I said no to sex or if I would say I were to tired he would say ‚Äúthat‚Äôs ok I‚Äôll just put it in while your asleep‚Äù. Because of my  low iron I would faint regularly and at any chance he could, he would fuck me while passed out . I started self harming and started an eating disorder. I felt so alone and had no one to talk to but him. It started to get close to my birthday and begged to have a girls only birthday party with my friends but he quickly shut it down and said if I do this it will ruin his surprise. This made me look differently at our current relationship. Maybe he‚Äôs noticed what he‚Äôs been doing and wants to make it up to me. \n\nHe began to explain this beautiful dinner date in the city then a drunken stroll down the beach. I felt so happy to hear that he could be this nice. \nMy birthday came. We were supposed to meet at mine at 10 am to have a lunch with my family but he didn‚Äôt show. I called him 37 times. I finally called his mum and she told me straight with no emotion ‚Äúhe‚Äôs just gone to pick up his ex and said he‚Äôll be by yours around 9‚Äù I hung up the phone and cried and messaged josh to stay away and don‚Äôt bother coming to the house.\nI spent my birthday with my mum sobbing then he finally called me and I kept declining until he turned up at my door beggin to be let in which my sister did. He came up to me and apologised bunched of times in front of alot of my family members to the point I was turning red from embarrassment. I finally agreed to forgive him just to make him stop making a scene.  He then says he‚Äôs gonna have to cancel the date since he has no money and was wondering if I would pay with the money I got for a present by my dad who was too busy with work to show up. I cried all night that night. The next day comes and I tell him that if he touches me or even tries to kiss me or say that he loves me I‚Äôm throwing him out the house and never speaking to him again. He agreed. \nI then start crying out of no where realising that my birthday was ruined and that I can never look back on this day happily again. He tried to hug me and I pushed him off me and he dramatically fell on the floor. He then climbs on top of me putting his elbow on my neck to the point where I can‚Äôt breath and my arms pressured down by his knees forcing it down and his hand covering my mouth so no one can hear me. He screams in my face and tells me to apologise for being a shitty girlfriend. So I do. He finally gets off me and I run out the house with my phone calling my dad to pick me up and take me to his house that is a 2 hour drive. Luckily he was only half an hour away from me so I run in the direction he‚Äôs coming from. I spend the week at my dads and I send josh a long break up text then block him on everything. I stay at my dads for a month and a bit longer until I arrive back home and feel like I just breathed for the first time.\nIt‚Äôs been a year or so since then and I‚Äôm happy to say I‚Äôm a better person because of josh and I now know what to look out for in a relationship and that I don‚Äôt have to stay in a relationship with anyone just to make them feel better.",

My family loaded up into the van and led the way while my brothers family followed behind us. \n\nEverything was going good until we were on a small two lane road heading up the mountains. There is no cell service, due to the flood warnings everyone was driving safe. \nAs we are driving, we are in the right lane (my brother behind us). A black car turns around the mountain side and crosses from his left lane directly into our lane on the right and speeds up. At this point everything slowed down.\nEverything next happened within seconds. \n\nI thought the person must have fallen asleep and went into our lane until I realized he matched my husbands movements. My husband served in the army as an infantry man and was stationed in Afghanistan back in 2009. \nAs soon as he saw the man go into our lane my husband immediately said this man was purposefully trying to kill us in a head on head collision going 65 mph. My husband went left, the man went left, my husband went right, the man went right , my husband realized this and tricked the man by pretending to go left again then immediately went right. \nAt that moment I felt nothing besides helplessness. There was no other moves to make to avoid this collision. Thankfully my husband tricked him and we BARELY missed hitting head on. Instead he drove right past us and we drove into the roadside dirt and mountain. \n\nThis all happened in seconds. \nMy brothers family saw us swerving and slowed down but didn‚Äôt see the guy in front of us until we were able to move out his line of sight to safety. He sped off.\n\n\nI was in shock. \nIn the moments before we got out of it I came to terms with okay we are going to hit head on .. I am going to die..I hope my babies will survive ..\nI woke up today having full body panic attacks. Yesterday my body was calm and my mind was in disbelief. Today my mind is playing everything on a loop. My body feels like it‚Äôs in fight or flight mode. I feel the fear of dying and I can‚Äôt process it. Can someone give me some advice? I can‚Äôt get in to see a therapist or psychiatrist until may. I keep telling myself that we are okay, the what ifs don‚Äôt matter but I can‚Äôt turn it off and I physically feel like I‚Äôm still in the car about to die.",

    "title": "Dealing with being sexually assaulted as a man.",
    "selftext": "The topic of being sexually assaulted as a man is so mind-numbingly hard to tackle. I am not a psychiatrist, a doctor, or any type of medical professional, but I am a victim of this myself, and I want to share my story and hopefully give anyone who needs it advice for beginning the healing process.\n\nA little about my story for context: I was in an abusive, toxic relationship for about 4 months. I am the type to commit very heavily, and I clung to every last bit of hope that my abuser gave me. I am trying to separate from them now, but they seem to be very keen on texting me and tracking me with an app called Life360 that I have now deleted from my phone, but I don't know if it still works if I don't have it. She is a very sensitive and emotional \"princess complex\" girl, which led to her being very sensitive to little things, like me being gone longer than I said I would be with friends or at work. She has even given my number to the marine corps and told them I was interested and had them call me during a time she knew I would be asleep. I still clung to the relationship because I was certain I was in love with this woman, but I now see that was foolish.\n\nThe SA came in the form of her forcing herself on me. I am a much larger man in stature, and I could have pushed her off, but for some reason, I was too worried about her crying or being upset or doing some other irrational things if I said no. I had sex with her multiple times without being in the mood to \"tame the beast\" so to speak. To give you an idea of how sex crazy this woman is, she goes to dungeon parties and other kink events just to watch and enjoy the sights. Her whole life revolves around sex, and I felt if I denied it to her, she would lash out in more severe ways.\n\nIt took me a long time to realize that this was even sexual harassment. I mean, I enjoy sex. Sure I wasn't in the mood for it, but we had sex all the time. And she got on top of me and took matters into her own hands, but I could've stopped her. Sure, I was afraid of what she'd do if I didn't let her, but come on. I'm the man, I should be able to just say no and weather the storm right?\n\nI am a 6'3, 248lb man who works two jobs and is currently doing schooling to become a Certified Personal Trainer and a Nutritionist. I exercise every day, practice BJJ and other forms of MMA with my friends to substitute somedays, and work very hard to make what I want to happen happen. I am very secure with myself and have always been confident. So suffice it to say I have never felt more emasculated than being forced into sex by a 5'something, 100something lb woman, and feeling helpless but to give her what she wanted. The police would laugh, my family would shun me, and my friends would be utterly confused.\n\nI am still recovering I feel, and I'm not sure if I'll ever stop recovering. However, I still feel that I can help those who have suffered similar states of affairs maybe begin their journey, or help themselves through the journey they've already started.\n-----\n1. Recognize that you were assaulted. For whatever reason, it happened, it was not okay. Do not apologize, fold, or stop yourself from seeing it that way, no matter what your abuser or anyone else tells you.\n\n2. Sever the relationship. The ties do not matter. Do not cling to hope for the relationship no matter what. They are not your friend. They are evil. Look how they've treated you. That is not how friends treat each other.\n\n3. Comfort yourself IN A HEALTHY MANNER. Whether it be greasy food, video games, or time out with friends, find something that has brought you comfort and take time to yourself. Drugs, alcohol, and sex are NOT THE ANSWER! No healing will come from them. If you can, call in sick from work. Just lay in bed, and allow yourself to rest.\n\n4. Practice journaling and mindfulness. Try your hardest to love yourself again. If you're anything like me, you probably feel so small and insignificant imagining what happened to you. Journaling your thoughts and feelings can be a big way to realize you truly are so much better than you feel you are.\n\n5. Keep busy. Work hard, and fill that time and space you once used to give attention to the enemy with a hobby, or your job. Follow what you want, and if you have no idea what it is you truly want, distract yourself as much as you possibly can. Get better at the guitar, grind some ranked with the boys, or put more hours in at work. Anything to not let the event consume you.\n-----\nI truly do hope anything, anything at all helped you here. I'm not sure what the future holds, but it is a brighter space without my abuser in my life, and I can truly focus on being a better person now. I hope your journey is as quick and painless as possible, and if you'd like, you can DM me and we can talk about your story, or just be friends in general! I'm very extroverted, so I'd love to hear your story and be a friend for you.",

It was swept under the rug and my family treat him the same, even though there was an additional incident I was not part of. I was excluded from family functions because I couldn‚Äôt be in the same room as him without totally losing it. I moved to another state at 20 years old and rarely visited. I‚Äôm now 35 and moved home. My grandma has finally acknowledged that I can‚Äôt be around this family member and has made a sort of schedule for the day: my abuser will be with the family the first part of the day and when the family is done eating he will leave and I will join. I feel thankful the situation has finally been acknowledged, but I‚Äôm still very hurt that my family acts like nothing happened. He‚Äôs around all of the kids and I‚Äôve seen pictures with kids playing on his lap. As you can imagine, I‚Äôm disgusted. I want a relationship with my family. I‚Äôve been through years of therapy. I‚Äôm in a much better place than ever before, which is why I felt OK to move home. But I still feel a deep betrayal and I know some family members look down on me like I did something wrong. It‚Äôs awkward, to say the least. I don‚Äôt know if spending time with my family during holidays is worth the pain I go through. But if I continue to hide, does he win?",

    "selftext": "Hi. There's a bit of a story for context:\n\nLast night I had an experience where it was SO EASY to talk to my roommate. I usually struggle with making conversation, but for some reason last night it was easier. I think it had something to do with the fact that he was Drunk (yes, capital D drunk). I think because I perceived his guard to be down, I had an easier time speaking with him.\n\nBut I don't think his guard is ever up the way that I believe it is - I think that's my trauma talking and trying to keep me from \"interrupting someone's day\".... even though he is sitting outside with me with the intent to have a conversation!\n\nI often find myself in situations where my roommates and I (we've all lived together for about 7 months) are sitting outside. They've each started a conversation that has ended, and so far as I can tell, it's my turn.\n\nBut I blank out, every time and I get really self conscious about it because I see it as a failing. And I relate it back to my traumatic child and teen years, where I was preoccupied with surviving instead of practicing socializing.\n\nI feel shame for not being able to speak with my roommates easily. And I want so badly to communicate on that shoot-breeze level. But I don't know how? And I'm scared to learn because I don't want to appear like I'm even more a fool.\n\nSo I've thought maybe I could explain, \"listen I don't have much experience with positive social relationships\" and maybe that would buy some leeway? But I don't want to tie my trauma to my efforts to learn in the present.\n\nSo I feel so preoccupied with memories of trauma, how how manage them, and I know me telling myself \"you're having trouble communicating because TRAUMA\" isn't helping.\n\nHas anyone been in a similar space before? How did you start socializing better? Or how did you stop using your trauma as an excuse?",

    "selftext": "Everyone compares themselves to others to some extent but when it plays on our thoughts frequently this can really impact on our wellbeing. The evidence on this has been around since the 1950s - people have always used their relative position against other people as a way of evaluating themselves. Its probably a natural part of the human experience, but problems arise when we‚Äôre constantly aware of what other people have and what we don‚Äôt have, leaving us dissatisfied with our lives.\n\nThe habits of being competitive and comparing ourselves may have built up over generations, so don‚Äôt beat yourself up for feeling this way. There isn‚Äôt a quick fix to it but there are a few things can help, the first being training your awareness. A little bit of practice every day makes a huge difference and we can use that training to be aware in the moment when that competitive energy is rising. In that moment, shining our awareness and giving that feeling our kindness while we breathe stops us from being swept away and breaks the link between feeling and acting.\n\nThe second way is to be grateful for what you have - keeping a log of three things every day of you‚Äôre grateful for is a great way to do this. These can be big things like your health, small things like your breakfast or neutral things like the feeling of your feet on the ground as you walk. Taking joy in the world around you is the formula for a happy life.\n\nThe last way is spending less time on the things that drive our competitive energy. That might be social media, certain TV programmes or it might be worth rethinking what you want from your career. If the alternative to eternally striving for success is a small, ordinary, happy life - whats wrong with that?\n\n[Listen On Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/comparing-yourself-to-others-is-unhealthy-life-doesnt/id1493806566?i=1000506294499)\n\n[Listen On Google Podcasts](https://www.google.com/podcasts?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9hbmNob3IuZm0vcy8xMjNkZThlMC9wb2RjYXN0L3Jzcw==)\n\n[Listen On Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/1ozwIEgzEtHQezPoi83nVV)\n\n[Other ways to listen](https://anchor.fm/shaun-donaghy/episodes/Comparing-yourself-to-others-is-unhealthy---life-doesnt-need-to-be-a-competition-epbv4e)",

Hypoarousal.\n\nI'm already diagnosed with a complex dissociative disorder from trauma starting in childhood, so I can *feel* my brain continually trying to pull away from the experience. When I get \"stuck\" thinking about it, I forget everything else. My history, my age, even my own name. I become this \"self\"-less entity whose awareness only extends to that trauma and not an inch further.\n\nI've had an avoidance of people and crowds since this happened as well. I quit my job. I've avoided public places. Even seeing my therapist this week was so intense I had a dissociative episode in session. When you see humans being violent toward other humans, it complicates that \"reach out for support\" advice. Suddenly humans become a threat, not a potential source of comfort.\n\nEating has been difficult, sleep even more so. My insomnia was already bad, but it's reached a new height. The nightmares have been horrendous. Awake, I feel a blanket of numb stillness overlaying abject terror. Hypervigilance is at its peak. Loud noises and raised voices launch me into hyperarousal. I cannot cry yet.\n\nI do not want what I saw to be dissociated away, retrievable again only through more years of hard therapy work.

It keeps coming up over and over.\n\n*Latest example: I got covid and my SO immediately took it on himself to help me in an attempt to make me feel better. Just a genuine desire to care. I immediately felt angry about a memory that made it up, about how every time I got help _forced_ on me by my parent, it came with blame, things like, \"if you didn't do anything, I'd have no extra work with you now\".

    "selftext": "Rock climbing saved my life. When I am on the side of that mountain, I feel more grounded, more alive, and more connected to the Universe. For me, it‚Äôs a holy place. This is my church. Furthermore, I have found climbing to be a beautiful metaphor for overcoming the difficulties life throws our way, sometimes. \n\nIn the rock climbing community as in everyday life, we refer to the obstacles we‚Äôre working through as ‚Äúproblems‚Äù. Although I am tired, hurting, and feel I can‚Äôt go on...I don‚Äôt give up. I continue pushing through the pain, doubt, and exhaustion until I finally reach the summit. At which point, I can reflect back on all the problems I overcame, the path I took, and what technique I used to get through it. Then, I can feel an overwhelming sense of pride and accomplishment for all my hard work. The next time I encounter a similar problem, I'll know what to do to get past it. \n\nNo one pushed or pulled me up the mountain. All that hard work was mine. The person on the ground belaying me is merely there to provide me with safety, support, and ensure I do not fall, should I stumble. Everything else is up to me. The more I work through my problems, with my friend supporting me on the ground, the stronger I become. \n\nYou see, therapy is a lot like rock climbing. In this allegory or metaphor, you (the climber) are the patient, the mountain is your crisis, the \"problems\" are all the obstacles that stand between you and overcoming the crisis such as the loss of a job or the death of a loved one or an illness, the summit is mental wellness, and the person belaying you is the therapist. \n\nWhile your therapist doesn't tell you how to feel, what to think, or what conclusions to come to, they are there as a constant support to figuratively catch you should you have any setbacks during your journey. They keep you safe and secure by \"holding the rope\" so that you do not plummet, and so you can resume where you left off whenever you are ready. You can absolutely achieve wellness on your own, but the trek will be significantly more difficult, and there will be no one on the \"on the ground\" to spot an easier path or remind you of different techniques you can implement to overcome those problem areas. So even though you are the one doing all the work, your therapist is an integral part of your team, who spots the problem areas ahead of time and assists in identifying the various tools you can use to get past them. Thus, rock climbing has taught me that when you replace \"I\" with \"we\", mental illness truly does become mental wellness‚ù§",

    "selftext": "My wife was almost 14 weeks pregnant this weekend. We went to the lake to celebrate my sisters birthday with some other couples. Everything was great and normal. We were playing games at night when she started cramping and bleeding. I tried to subtly escort her to the bathroom, but there was a pool of blood in her seat. We had a scare and went to ER last week, but she and baby were fine. Friday we had an appointment and the baby seemed fine. \n\nWe didn‚Äôt sleep much that night. She was restless, but had mostly stopped bleeding. She convinced me that we could go to the ER in the morning if she was still bleeding. I woke up to her screams in the morning. She was bleeding a lot and while I was getting her towels she delivered on the toilet. I‚Äôll never forget her screams and the words that came out of her mouth. I was on the phone with 911 and was told to tie the chord and hold the baby while I assisted my wife to the ground as we waited for the Ambulance. I held my dead child, which my wife had to carry as it was still attached to her. I can‚Äôt fathom the heartbreak she felt and feels. I deeply sympathize, but I fear I‚Äôll never be able to understand that level of pain. I held her until they came. My amazing wife was stable and after talking we decided I‚Äôd follow by car. The whole ride over I prayed that the lights wouldn‚Äôt come on. I‚Äôve never felt so numb. I cried silently, but had to stay strong for her.\n\nWe took the day off and have been embracing each other and crying and just giving each other love. I‚Äôm absolutely devastated, but need to be strong for my wife. I guess I don‚Äôt know if I need to vent or if I‚Äôm looking for resources, but I just needed to get this off my chest. I just feel so numb. So much loss and grief. I feel empowered that I was able to step up and stay strong when my wife needed me and we‚Äôve been so bonded and together, but even those thoughts as a silver lining makes me feel guilty. How could any good come from the single most tragic event in my life?\n\nWe were so attached and everything seemed so perfect. I‚Äôd already mentally reprioritized my life, everything was/is insignificant in comparison, but it just feels so empty now.\n\nWe aren‚Äôt in any way having dangerous thoughts and we are coping in healthy ways, but it‚Äôs still so hard. We don‚Äôt drink and do have faith which helps, but this is a pain unlike any other.\n\n**************\n\nEdit/update: My wife had a follow up appointment today, the doctor was very kind and empathetic and provided us with some resources and good advice. We can at the least rest assured that my wife is healthy and that we are in a good spot to continue the healing. We were able to get my wife a week off of work (unpaid, but still her healing is far more important than a paycheck) and with me being self employed and going to school I am keeping busy and prioritizing my wife above everything else for now. \n\nThank you from the bottom of my heart to all of you for your kindness and compassion. This is the hardest thing I‚Äôve gone through and it‚Äôs been so hard talking with friends and family, but knowing I have the support of kind and caring strangers who‚Äôve allowed me a platform to grieve is just incredible. Thank you for all that you do and I pray that you‚Äôll continue dedicating your time to help and comfort strangers. I hope to pay it forward as well. Bless all of you and sincerely, thank you.",

    "selftext": "Tw: death, child abuse\n\nStarting from the beginning‚Ä¶. I (F) grew up in a very abusive home and was routinely failed by adults, as an adult looking back I still can‚Äôt wrap my head around the amount of adults that turned a blind eye or more horrifyingly the ones who joined in. I would have been completely alone in my pain/suffering if it wasn‚Äôt for that 1 person, my best friend, my savior; as much as he could be being a kid stuck in the same situation, and we shared a bond I cannot describe.  He was my person, the person who new my pain, the person who shielded me, the person who took care of me, he was; quite literally all i had, he was my big brother and then he died right in front of me, he was 10 years old.\n\nTo say its hard for me to talk/write about it is an understatement, it rips my heart out to think about what i lost that day. \n\nTo understand my story you have to understand how i was raised. My earliest memories are of my father abusing my mother, i was maybe 4 years old. My mother, who was 13 years younger than my father, couldn‚Äôt handle the abuse and i don‚Äôt blame her but she forgot to take us when she left. My father, who lacked the emotional capacity to raise children,  I would describe as a sociopath. Cold and detached with a hatred of women, and i was the girl. His abuse soon narrowed in on my brother and I. I can recall many times Greg (my brother) took the fall because he know what was coming. See i was held to a different standard, i was a girl and ‚Äúboys will be boys‚Äù didn‚Äôt apply to me. We were routinely locked out of the house when my father wasn‚Äôt home, my father would later say in court that ‚Äúit was his house, why would he allow other people in his house when he wasn‚Äôt home?‚Äù.  The day Greg died was one of those days/ nights we were kicked out of the house. \n\nWe lived next to a pretty large highway, large for a 9 and 10 year old anyways, with a grass median dividing the 2 directions of traffic. Routinely we would have to cross the highway to go to Checkers ( fast food place ) to get dinner as we did that fateful night. Armed with $2 each we crossed the highway and got some hotdogs. We ran back, i stopped in the median as we had done a millions times before, but Greg didn‚Äôt stop, he kept running. Squeals echoed out from the tires of the car in the first lane and drew my attention to the road. There he stood, in the far lane, just looking at me. Time slowed in a way that it almost stood still. We stared at each other as a wave of calm came over his face. Did he think the squeal of the tires were for me? Just then time caught up as his attention went to the headlight that was racing towards him. He tried to jump as if he could jump clear over the car and avoid what was to come. He was hit by a car going 55 mph. Like a ragdoll he was flung in the air, landing face down in the grassy hill next to the highway. I let out a scream from the depth of my soul as i ran towards him. The passenger of the car scooped me up and landed me next to a street light, holding me back from seeing what i already knew. I knew my hysterics would get me nowhere so with all my strength i calmed myself as much as i could and began to beg and bargain for the permission to see him. I promised to stay calm, to not scream, to not touch him but my declarations were not convincing enough. \n\nI was usher to a near by house to use their phone to contact my father, only problem was I couldn‚Äôt think clear enough to remember his pager # (this all happened in 1996 so landlines and pagers were the norm). I knew all the #s but couldn‚Äôt remember the order they went in through my now dream like trance. Next i was passed from ambulance, to fire truck, to police car reciting what had happened. I begged each one to let me see my brother to no avail. Greg was life flighted to the all children‚Äôs hospital and i was sent to a neighbors house while my father rode with my brother. I remember staring at the digital clock on their VCR all night. The next day my father came to collect me and bring me to the hospital where Greg was. This was the first time i got to see greg after the accident but i knew he was already gone and i knew my chance to say goodbye had passed. I had felt it on the scene, in the moments after the crash, while i pled for the opportunity to see him. My mother was at the hospital and she immediately took custody of me. The next day my brother was taken off of life support, it was july 4th. The following day my father was tasked with telling me about my brothers death, it was the last time i spoke with him. I started showing signs of PTSD right away. I would have episodes of sleep walking where i would be screaming and reliving the event of that night. It felt like I didn‚Äôt sleep for months. \n\nI was put into intensive therapy where they worked to strip him from my dreams, slowly dismantling his features and replacing him with a mannequin. Slowly they stripped my ability to remember my dreams all together. I still live with this trauma everyday and i cannot seem to pass it. I have an, albeit illogical, fear of medical settings and i catch myself daydreaming about car accidents while i drive. While driving i will run through all the possibilities of scenarios of accidents that could happen at any particular moment, to the point of panic. I feel that i will live with this forever, maybe i think healing will dishonor my brother, idk but almost 26 years later it feels as fresh as ever. \n\nGreg was hit, from what i understand, by two teenage boys. I often think about them and what impact this has had on their lives. I dont feel they are to blame and i hold no anomosity towards them. I sincerely hope that they were able to heal and i wish them all the best in life. I dont know what i hope to get out of this post, i simply felt compelled to share...",

    "title": "If you feel stuck and are struggling to change a certain aspect of yourself, or of your life, it is likely because the approach you are using does not address your past, present and future. Let me tell you why.",
    "selftext": "If you feel stuck and are struggling to change a certain aspect of yourself, or of your life, it is likely because the approach you are using does not address your past, present and future. If you neglect even just one of these 3 elements, you will eventually feel stuck. Let me explain what I mean by that and how by combining approaches from 3 different fields, you can have a much more complete and effective process for transformation.\n\nIt all starts with the desire to change. There is something that you desire but you don‚Äôt have or something you want to see in yourself but it is not there at the moment. In essence, you build an image of yourself that is better than the present one. This image is your target, your future destination.\n\nFor me it started here too. I wanted to be able to socialize, make friends and go on dates. I wanted to express myself freely with no fears, feel comfortable even in high pressure situations and have no anxiety. That was the desire that ignited the transformation process.\n\nI first came across life coaching. Although I was very skeptical in the beginning, I became rapidly fascinated with it. The new ideas made a lot of sense to me and once I started trying them, the results really surprised me. I was amazed at how simple things such as changing mindsets or controlling my focus could change my inner state and make such a difference. It changed the way I understood myself and made me a much more positive person. I had a very rigid idea of who I was and suddenly that idea was shaken. I realised I could change much more than I previously thought. \n\nThis brings me to the second element of time that life coaching is good at addressing: the present. Once you have a destination you need to take concrete steps, a plan of action is required, and action happens in the present. Life coaching is great for that. However, there is another field that also has a lot to contribute: eastern spirituality teachings.\n\nYou are probably familiar with the idea of living in the present and being mindful. These ideas came to me through Zen and tantra teachings and showed me that what happens in the present is more than just a step towards a destination, we must enjoy walking our path and make the most out of it. That is a way of being but should also include tools that enable you to savor pleasant emotions in their full extent and tools to allow you to deal with unpleasant feelings in a healthy way.\n\nThere is one more element to talk about: the past. As I progressed in my path, I started to have difficulties overcoming deep rooted patterns and I struggled to find a tool that helped. I even tried the ‚Äúfake it until you make it‚Äù approach but it was disastrous. When it came to situations that triggered my fight or flight response, I was absolutely powerless.\n\nIt was clear that deep subconscious patterns related to trauma were very difficult, or even impossible, to overcome with the approaches from life coaching that I knew. In other words, life coaching seemed to be great at addressing the future and the present, but fell short when it came to the past.\n\nUsually, the furthest in the past, the more difficult a certain pattern is to address. This can be a certain behavior that you are unable to control, or it can be the way you feel in certain situations or with certain people. These are all patterns that are in your subconscious mind, that‚Äôs why you feel that you have no control over them because indeed your conscious mind cannot easily reach them.\n\nIf the patterns are there as a result of trauma, it is even more difficult to change. The field of trauma therapy has the best tools to address these patterns but there are approaches from eastern teachings that are also great for this. In fact, I had great results and went through some deep healing in a 10-day meditation retreat I did years ago.\n\nNo matter how important addressing the past might be, focusing exclusively on it, can be equally a mistake. People that go through therapy only sometimes complain to me. In the beginning, there is a huge moment of letting go because they are talking about things that have been suppressed for years, in some cases they are opening up for the first time. On its own, this is enough to bring a huge relief and lightness. However, it is common for people to very rapidly reach a point of ‚Äúand now what?‚Äù. This happens because this field is not specialised in the future, it is mostly about dealing with the past. This can lead people to feel a bit lost and without knowing how to proceed next. Plus, they might finally identify the origin of the ‚Äúproblem‚Äù but they lack the knowhow of how to proceed in the present in a different way. There needs to be an effective way to create an alternative to the pattern of the past.\n\nSo there you go, there‚Äôs the past, present and future and there is life coaching, trauma therapy and eastern spirituality teachings. All have something to offer. The 3 fields actually affect the 3 elements of time although some are better suited for some problems rather than others. In my opinion, selecting and combining tools from each field is the most effective approach because it offers the possibility to address the 3 elements of time in a systematic and harmonious way.\n\nAddressing the past is about letting go of old patterns that do not serve us anymore and healing from trauma. The present is about taking concrete action and living in a mindful way. The future is about creating goals, constantly refining a vision of the life you want and the person you want to be.\n\nIf you neglect even just one of these elements, you will feel stuck and encounter resistance to change. If you do not address the future, you will feel you have no direction, you are lost and purposeless.\n\nIf you don‚Äôt address the present, you either do not take action, so you will not change. Or you take action without a mindful approach, meaning that you take steps, but you won‚Äôt enjoy the ride. All your actions will be done for the hope of a future happiness that might never come.\n\nIf you neglect the past, you will feel that you are carrying unnecessary weight, you will encounter resistance time and time again, you might see things change on the outside but inside you will still feel the same. If there is pain, you will feel pain, no matter what you accomplish. You can end up carrying the feeling of lack of self-worth, shame, or any other form of suffering your whole life.\n\nChange and healing is possible as long as you have the right tool for the job.",

    "selftext": "About two weeks ago, I (27F) was one of the victims of a car chase shooting in North Chicago. We were driving in the wrong place at the wrong time, two cars turned onto the same street as us, started shooting, and a bullet went through our windshield and hit me in the left arm. It was the scariest moment of my life and I was completely in shock. My fianc√© and dog were also in the car, and thankfully weren‚Äôt injured. \n\nClearly, I am very traumatized by this. I‚Äôm very anxious when walking around outside, especially when I get in the car with my fianc√© (haven‚Äôt driven myself anywhere yet, my arm still hurts and I don‚Äôt think I mentally can). I jump at hearing the squealing of car tires and get very panicked when I see a car with tinted windows. Even just walking past people makes me nervous. It‚Äôs taken me a lot of courage and baby steps just to be able to get back in the car and walk around the block with my fianc√© and my dog. The bullet in my arm just feels like a constant reminder that this could happen to me again. I know my family is hurting too because they are worried about me. \n\nI am still waiting to hear back from a trauma therapist. Apparently the behavioral health center that is covered by my insurance is ‚Äúreally busy.‚Äù I‚Äôve been calling in to a general therapist through my workplace solutions program, but I don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs enough. I‚Äôm taking some time off work too (I‚Äôm at teacher, so that‚Äôs been quite the hurdle too). My fianc√© is being very supportive and patient, but he is just coping with this much better than I am. Please help, any advice is appreciated.

    "selftext": "Hi! I‚Äôm new to this sub. Honestly, new to talking about my feelings about my past as well. Though it may seem like it, I‚Äôm not going to burden you with my entire life story. Besides, just thinking about posting about this one subject sent my heart rate up to 120+, so I‚Äôm in no mood to do that tonight anyhow lol.\n\nSo, the thing that‚Äôs really been getting me is, during my late childhood (11-17) I was involved in at least 9 evictions, and moved 15+ times, all within one county. \n\nI had lived in the same house my whole life, until I was 11.  It was paid off when I was about 7 years old. My father had a construction business until about 2009, then had to get his CDLs, and go out on the road. My mother became an alcoholic,and she was just the type of person who couldn‚Äôt even handle one drink, without turning into something truly evil. Of course my parents divorced. My mother drank everyday, my father kept driving, ended up getting hooked on hard drugs somewhere in that timeframe. Mom took out a loan on the house for a $100,000, apparently no proof of paying it back besides child support. She sold two cars. The only thing my dad had in his name was his pickup truck, although he was always the sole income. \n\nAnyway, she never paid a payment on the house, after taking out the loan. So, the house she had for over 25 years, the one my dad completely remodeled \ninto something really spectacular, with a pool and pool house, lots of land, and literally everything she could‚Äôve dreamed, and the place I knew as home, she let it go seemingly completely willingly. Ended up totaling her Cadillac. The thing that was so shit about it was EVERYTHING was already paid off. It was really disheartening for my dad to have everything he worked for his whole life be just thrown away at 44.\n\nI didn‚Äôt get kicked out of my childhood home though, fortunately. I moved out, and in with my dad, about a year before the bank seized it. We lived on the lake, in a trailer for about a year, the rent was  just lot rent and it was really cheap, but I was honestly a spoiled brat in recovery, due to my prior situations and being an only child pretty much. I didn‚Äôt like it because it was very small, and it was a bit run down, and just a complete  change for me. So he found a better trailer in the same area, and we moved in there. I think lived there about 7 months before getting evicted. Luckily, place #3 was in line already. It was very nice. I loved it at 12 years old. It was painted bright blue with a wraparound porch, on the lake, and I had the whole basement as my room! I made a lot of good memories, with the kids in that community, and I think it was honestly one of the most fun times in my life honestly. \n\nHowever, I also began to learn of my dads substance abuse problems,  \nduring this time, but I kept that as hidden as I could to everyone else. I just tried not to think about it. My dad was genuinely, and really is still, an absolutely wonderful person who is ready to help anyone he‚Äôs capable of.\n\nAnyhow, the summer rolled around, lots of fun, dad ended up getting a short term job hauling. My cousin stayed with us for a bit, then moved out in good timing. Dad made his last run to California, and I went with, being my first time to see the place. I remember my dad ripping what I guess was the eviction notice off the door when we got back. \n\n Less than a week later, I went to bed and was excited for my very first band camp. I was awoken the next morning to the elderly landlady yelling at me and a policeman standing beside her, shining his flashlight. In a just absolute hateful tone I had heard before from my mother, she said something right along the lines of. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know where your dad is, but he‚Äôs two months behind on rent! You were supposed to be out today!‚Äù I obviously start bawling, and begging her to please just come back in an hour, that my dad would be back. she tells me to ‚Äúquit your crying, and if you‚Äôve got a phone I‚Äôd be trying to call him, I‚Äôm about to start chunking your stuff out into the rain ‚Äù and I didn‚Äôt so I was in just absolute distress. Begging the cop to please make her go away. I started packing stuff up, my dad got home in less than 10 minutes. He took me to my Aunt‚Äôs, and she took me to band camp. I didn‚Äôt get to eat anything that day but some crackers beforehand because of the madness, and I was just heartbroken all the day, and weeks to come. \n\n\nThe evictions carried on time and time again afterward, but thinking about that  particular experience just makes my skin crawl. I don‚Äôt know why the landlady had to scream at me the way she did, she was very angry and I completely understand why, but I was 12 and there was nothing I could do about it, and I was already clearly in a shit situation to begin with. \n\nI really didn‚Äôt mean to ramble so much, but it kind of feels nice. Thank you for providing a space for me to do so for once. It‚Äôs still kind of taboo for me to talk about with most people I know.\n\n\nEdit: I realized my title makes no sense. It‚Äôs supposed to say ‚Äúisn‚Äôt worse at all compared to the others‚Äù",

I'll be triggered/ in a panic for no reason if someone holds me down or if sex occurs in the dark. \n\nNow, I've never had any explicit memories of sexual abuse - but always been suspicious/felt like something happened to me by my father. \n\nMy question is, does cannabis uncover repressed memories? I've only gotten high off my edibles two times in my life. The first time was four years ago & and while i was having sex with my boyfriend at the time, an image of my dad flashed into my brain and i panic and said \"I think my dad abused me\" - I talked to my mom, she said she was suspicious of my dad abusing me but never saw anything herself. She told me, \"you were high, you can't trust anything happened\" Okay - i thought to myself, \"Im crazy\" \"I was high\", etc. So I've never done edibles again, being so scared that would happen again. Well yesterday I ACCIDENTALLY ate a very strong edible, and while i was pleasing myself - I felt myself get really scared again and then a memory flashed into my head - I was three years old - with VERY DETAILED images of my childhood home, and objects around me I hadn't even thought of at (the old couch with green and white stripes, the old basement smell, the old tv set). It was a memory of my dad stimulating me and it was painful yet felt good which then felt confusing. I started to cry and felt extremely terrified. Could I have just uncovered the abuse that happened to me?",

    "selftext": "I discovered a new trauma trigger yesterday, and I don't know how to deal with it. \n\nFor background, I'm engaged to a really wonderful, loving man. We've been together over three years, have a healthy and happy relationship, and I am currently 6 months pregnant with our first child. Life is good at home. In the past, though, I was in long term relationships with two different emotionally and (sometimes physically) abusive alcoholic men. I've grown and changed and healed a lot since those relationships, and am happy to be in a better place today. So here's the story:\n\nSince I've known him, my fianc√© has always kept his hair medium short, but decided to grow it out when he got furloughed due to Covid back in April. Now, 6 months later, he decides to keep the length, but go in for a trim and style. I've become really attached to his longer hair, and have found a lot of comfort and calm from playing with it during my pregnancy, but I'm all for a nice style. When he came home from the barber yesterday, though, he had changed his mind and gotten a buzz cut. When he walked in the door and I saw his head, I felt a mixture of shock and revulsion, then confusion and deep sadness and hurt. I figured my pregnancy hormones were just going haywire, that I shouldn't be so upset about a bad haircut, it's his own head, etc. But still, I took some space last night and today to process what I was feeling and try to make sense of it. Then earlier today, it finally clicked that both of my abusive exes had that haircut at one time, and that looking at my fianc√© now brings back the feelings of fear and vulnerability and disgust that I felt back then. \n\nI've been trying to figure out how to deal with this new trigger all day. I already don't want to look at my fianc√©, I flinch when he touches me, and I've closed myself off emotionally. I don't want to keep feeling this way for the next few months, which are such a hugely important time for us with the baby, but I can't shake these feelings. \n\nSo, how do I deal with a trigger that I can't avoid? How do I create new associations or let go of the old ones? Any helpful advice would be appreciated. <3\n\nTL;DR: My fianc√© got his haircut like my abusive ex's, and created a new trauma trigger for me. How do I deal with it?",

    "title": "Healing Trauma Part 3 - Understanding Dysregulation of the brain",
    "selftext": "This is the third of many posts on a series I'm calling \"Healing Trauma, the basics\".  Some of these posts will give specific advice for things to do in your daily life and others will simply introduce healing mindsets.\n \nPost #3 Understanding Dysregulation\n \nThis is the third post of the series because I see it as being valuable information in our box of tools that we may need to use to heal from trauma.  First of all, from my perspective, everyone is traumatized - narcissistic and/ or abusive parents / relationships, childhood abuse, cruel words and actions from peers growing up, and even any, yes literally any, unresolved emotions.  There are degrees to trauma but the point here is that everyone gets traumatized. So, in case you haven't read it yet, let's start here with my definition of what trauma is. \n \nI say that when a human being experiences a circumstance that overwhelms their mind-body system based on the current mental, emotional and physical status at that moment, their system kicks in the emergency response switch (trauma response) in order to save the entire system.  The traumatic moment is logged as a memory in the system (not just mentally but emotionally and physiologically as well) so that if similar circumstances arise again, it can be prepared to defend itself at all costs (think trigger here).  \n \nSo where does the brain come into all of this?  \n \nThe brain is like the central processing unit (CPU) for the entire mind-body system of a human being.  The brain runs the show and directs the whole system.  It is a highly complex and SENSITIVE part of the human body.  It needs to be sensitive because it has so much information to process and interpret at any given time...so many trillions of units of information every second every day for our entire lives.  Every sensation, every stimulus in our environment is processed by our brain and our brains send the feedback information throughout our entire system through complex ways.  We receive this feedback (to simplify it here) in terms of pleasure or pain and degrees of those.  And we can think of our emotions as part of this feedback system letting us know how to proceed and what to do.  Now what if this highly complex brain isn't functioning the way it was intended.  What if it's damaged or altered in some way?  Well trauma does alter and even damage the brain.  Here let's use an example:\n \nThink here of a human spine.  When we are children our spine and bone structure is not totally hardened.  They need to be flexible as our bodies grow.  Imagine if they were rigid and our bodies still had to grow 4 more feet...  Not so good right?  Well imagine if a child walked hunched over for 10 years straight while their spine was still forming.  The bones would eventually become rigid, as they all eventually do, and harden into place into that hunched over form.  We can all imagine the problems and pain this would cause that poor child later in life.  Some know this all too well as their reality.  Well this is a perfect analogy for our brains and trauma.  When we are young our brains are soaking up every experience presented to us without thinking, without questioning any of it.  In fact, thinking hasn't even started yet by the time our brains have already been absorbing data beyond belief.  Nature intended it to be this way.  We are completely vulnerable and need to be taken care of. The brain of a small child has no capacity to distinguish between what may ultimately be good for it or bad for it later on because we are meant to attach to our caregivers, those who are supposed to care for us and have our best interest in mind.  The idea here is that we ultimately take on the similar characteristic thought and behavioral patterns of our caregivers so that we will be accepted into that family structure and will be more likely to get love and support from them.  Well this whole process is a double edged sword and you may already be starting to see why...\n\n \nWhat if the caregivers do NOT have the best interest of the child in mind or what if the caregivers were themselves traumatized?  Well, a child can be programmed to believe just about anything.  It can be programmed to hate itself, to hate others, to hate a specific religion, or race, or programmed to harm itself, or not to feel emotions, or to be afraid, insecure, etc.  The list goes on and on here for the possibilities.  The point is that when children are young they are absorbing all the conditioning. The brain is using the conditioning to form complex patterns of thinking and feeling that will ultimately determine that human beings' idea of themselves and the world.  The child is completely innocent.  Their body is completely innocent.  So loving and so innocent that it questions none of it. And each bit of conditioning is input into the newly developing mind-body system of the child.  Each input will eventually give an output in the form of thinking and feeling.  Thinking and feeling is how we interact consciously with our environment.  It's the feedback that helps us determine what to do and how to do it.  But for so many human beings, the CPU, the brain, isn't functioning properly because of trauma.  In other words, we misperceive reality, situations, circumstances, because our CPU is analyzing the data through the lens of trauma.  And there are many degrees of trauma.  It's not all the same.  The point is though that it harms the entire system of the human being.\n \nSo what happens when the brain doesn't function properly because of trauma?\n \nWell since the brain is responsible for regulating the system (think of how the CPU runs the computer) trauma causes the brain to dysregulate the system.  The brain can misperceive a situation and completely shut down the system (think panic attacks).  It can perceive danger where there is none.  Honestly, the list goes on and on for the ways our brains can misperceive reality.  The main point here is that it's our brains screwing things up by sending incorrect signals to our whole system.  Please don't blame the brain or the body though...both are innocent. And when we take steps to correct these misperceptions and change the system, we can experience a lot of pain and discomfort and find it very challenging.  Imagine the boy whose spine was hunched over trying to straighten it out when he got older.  It would be very, very painful once the bones have hardened.  Don't give up. It is not a lost cause though and there are things a human being can do.\n \nSo what's the takeaway from all this?\n \nFirst of all, please stop blaming and judging yourself for how your brain is dysregulating your system.  The idea here is to see our brains and bodies with loving compassion because they are innocent and always have been.  Our emotional reactions are conditioned responses.  Anxiety, fear, anger - all conditioned patterns in our system. Next, research the brain.  Find speakers who use concepts that help you make sense of what your brain is doing. But also research yourself in real time. Begin to see the patterns of dysregulation for you.  Find activities that help you to become more aware of when you're being dysregulated. Take conscious action to create situations and environments (as much as you can) that take that into account.  Set yourself up for success.  And if you fail, try not to see it as a failure.  See it as a learning opportunity. Lastly, research healing methods that take into account how your brain functions such as EMDR and others.  This is all meant to take us 1 step closer to loving ourselves the way we weren't loved when we were little.  So whatever happens, try to see yourself with eyes of gentleness, love and compassion.\n \nNamaste",

    "selftext": "Have you had an anxious over-reaction when something goes wrong -  you might think that if a relationship ends you‚Äôll never find someone else, if you fail an exam you can never have a successful career. You‚Äôre imagining all the terrible things that are going to happen, it feels like the world is ending and the house of cards is falling apart. \n\nSo what‚Äôs happening in our heads? The first thing that‚Äôs going awry is that we‚Äôre living in the hereafter. As humans we can‚Äôt live with happiness and calmness in the future - we can only live a joyful life in the present. When we notice our minds are moving into the future we can stop, we can breath and we can focus on something in the present - maybe our breath, our surroundings or an activity.\n\nAs well as living in the future, we‚Äôre predicting the worst possible outcomes - out of all the things that could possibly happen, our minds naturally go to the catastrophe. That's not something to worry about in itself - everyone has catastrophic thoughts and it kept us alive when human beings had to contend with predators and danger. \n\nYou probably don‚Äôt see a lot of wolves and tigers so we can give ourselves permission to take a step back and think it through. When catastrophic thinking arises we need to be aware enough to notice the thought and ask ourselves whether it‚Äôs really true or realistic. If it isn‚Äôt we can allow the thought to pass out of awareness, without being swept away and without any harm or damage to us.\n\nA third driver of catastrophic thinking is the belief that you can‚Äôt cope with whatever outcome you‚Äôre afraid of, that you‚Äôll somehow fall apart. Monsters live in the dark, so shine the light of awareness on it - you‚Äôve coped with difficult experiences in the past and you have a much greater reserve of strength and resilience than you‚Äôre aware of.\n\nEveryone experiences catastrophic thoughts, its natural and part of who we are - but our reaction to them decides whether they cause us suffering or they pass without harming us. Life is full of challenges as well as good and bad days; just because one day is bad does not mean all days will be bad. \n\nOne final thing to bear in mind is that is that we catastrophize more when we‚Äôre anxious and our mental health is poor, so get a regular wellbeing routine in place with a little meditation and awareness every day.\n\n[Listen On Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/catastrophizing-how-to-stop-worrying-pt2/id1493806566?i=1000513762561)\n\n[Listen On Google Podcasts](https://www.google.com/podcasts?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9hbmNob3IuZm0vcy8xMjNkZThlMC9wb2RjYXN0L3Jzcw==)\n\n[Listen On Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/1ozwIEgzEtHQezPoi83nVV)\n\n[Other ways to listen](https://anchor.fm/shaun-donaghy/episodes/Catastrophizing---how-to-stop-worrying-pt2-et2qr5)",

    "title": "Abused growing up, but now I'm feeling all these emotions at once now that I've come out about my gender identity and I'm struggling to hold it together now cus of all I've been through, is this normal?",
    "selftext": "[TW: Abuse, Some Sexual Mentions, Blood, Starvation comments, Self Harm mentions, Suicidal Thoughts]\n\n\nSo for context: I'm nonbinary, I'm 26 years old and I'm Autistic (high functioning, was diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome). My father was the abuser in my life but my mother had a tendency of lashing out against me because of the stress of dealing with his behaviour. The abuse was physical, psychological... emotional...\n\n\n\n\nWhen I was young, my father choked me in full view of my mother, due to a disagreement between two of us. I distinctly remember mom giving me ice cream after that. I also had a few instances of waking up and feeling like my tongue had gone down my throat and I was struggling to breath, and I always remember running around the house in a panic trying to get myself to breathe again, cus my nostrils didn't feel like they worked and the only thing that helped was climbing in bed with my parents. Mom was always the one to comfort me during that. Whenever I feel anxious or notice my breathing being a bit slow, I get hyperaware of it and try and overcompensate but I also keep remembering these events in the back of my mind. It always feels like I'm being choked rather than my nostrils not breathing enough.\n\n\n\n\nMy father also frequently engaged in constant yelling at me, frequently belittling me. Expecting me to carry heavy loads despite being rather frail (I was skinny and not into sports and reclusive because autism and anxiety and the effect of the abuse), and when I inevitably fail, would frequently berate me. He also had the habit of demanding answers to questions I didn't know how to answer, screaming at me to give him a yes or a no answer to a complicated question and getting mad when I said \"I DON'T KNOW!\". I also had two instances where he did a 'deadleg' on me, aka grabbed my leg and smacked it hard enough that it left an imprint of pain that made it hard to walk on that leg for the rest of the day. Usually after a disagreement. He also spanked me as a child for things I did wrong but he always stormed into my room, and beat me really hard on the exposed rear and then left. I never really got comfort for it from him. Yelling also became an easy way of causing me to 'shut down' as well, and often I went along with things for the fear of yelling.\n\n\n\n\nDuring school I was always bullied, I was the one people liked to wind up. The autistic kid dealing with senses and emotions he struggled to comprehend, made worse by the experiences at home. My mom often times started to expect me to magically know when she wanted certain chores done, made worse by my quickly growing escapism via video games. I always used to break down and beg her to stop expecting me to be 'psychic' because she would always be avoidant and short-to-the-point when in these situations, which used to result in either a distressed breakdown or angry lashing out and ripping into her about it. Kids used to bully me by comparing my name to that of a local celebrity, I hated it. They used to call me by a feminine version of my name, which agitated me for a different reason, I think it triggered some form of dysphoria and I lashed out because I sort of felt happy hearing that name in retrospect but it was the context it was used in combined with my father's attitudes...\n\n\n\n\nI also had trouble with anger. Lots of anger. Mostly towards my father. But I got suspended 3-4 times during high school and often during primary school because of attacking other students when they pushed me until I snapped. I wanted to end my father, violently. He kept belittling me and questioning my ability for independence. And it was extremely hard to keep that under the surface, my mother was usually the one who I ended up venting too. I also used to bottle up all my emotions and stresses until I couldn't by volcanically exploding into crying when I was alone with my mother after my agitated behaviour gave her a hint I needed comfort at some point.\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately I had to experience defending my mother from my father after a particularly vicious argument with each other, my father had been basically engaging in financial abuse against my mother, constantly buying stuff and expecting her to pay it back, and constantly accusing her of wasting money because she spent pretty much all the money on bills. She was also frequently forced to borrow money from him, who was on a pension due to previous military service and dad never worked. But in that incident, I threatened to use a broom on him, long enough for mom to escape. Unfortunately she didn't take me. She left me alone with him, so I hid in my room with the door locked and the light turned off since it was night time and tried to cry myself to sleep.\n\n\n\n\nMy dad is, to be blunt, a god damn narcissist, and I suspect a drug abuser who lied for medication given stuff he's said about certain medications he's been on for pain (preferring the tablet form over the liquid form of a certain restricted substance for instance). I was diagnosed with depression by a therapist, but unfortunately dad used to belittle me. Claiming he 'knew what depression was like' and that he 'had it worse'. He used to always try and make him seem like the most suffering. He always refused to do work around the house, claiming a spinal injury, which we really doubt was actually the case, especially within the last few years, mom found out he had been cheating on her behind her back whilst she was out of town for a work contract. Grandma on his side was also the same kind, also being a drama merchant, trying to start drama to make herself feel better or make her seem like the most hurt whilst making fun of other people's issues. Despite me being extremely drama avoidant for OBVIOUS REASONS DUE TO MY EXPERIENCES, My dad frequently compared me to her and said I was just like her, when in reality he was the most like her.\n\n\n\n\nWhenever I asked for help for something, I was made to feel like the burden for just wanting help getting clothes on the line since I lived in South East Queensland, Australia, where the UV index is really high. Unfortunately I'm a redhead and very pale, I freckle and burn instead of tanning. I was also in a very bad place of mind during high school, constantly thinking about dying. Looking up what life after death was like. Trying to think about reincarnation as a kind of 'hope' if I offed myself. I was too scared to actually go through with it, and so I settled for reducing my food intake as much as possible, throwing away the lunches mom made for me every day for school around that time. I wanted to get sick and die 'naturally', that way I would put the least amount of people out, because in my fucked up teenage mind, thought that a slow death was better than the feeling of pain. \n\n\n\n\nOne time my dad said that my mother was upset with me because I didn't have any friends, and I confronted my mother about it. She was confused. Later found out that conversation was that my mother was WORRIED FOR ME because I didn't have any friends and was concerned about my development. He also one time told me when we were alone that my mother didn't want any more children because I was autistic. I later learned this wasn't because I was autistic but because my mother had gone through a lot of miscarriages, one was nearly twin sisters I could have had, and didn't want to risk having any more children after I was born two weeks late after fearing she wouldn't be able to bring me to term. Also she didn't find any enjoyment in sex anymore.\n\n\n\n\nI also started wearing headphones and playing music often into my ears to distract myself, I became hypersensitive to the sound of footsteps because I would have to listen out for them because I was never allowed to lock my room and be alone. I always was mentally preparing for a screaming match or something. Dad really only interacted with me most of the time outside of the bad situations was to demand a coffee like every half a fucking hour. I hated it. But I was always paranoid of sounds in the house, for fear of dad coming near. Trying to hear past the headphones. \n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately dad picked up on me doing this and used it as an excuse that I should hear him whenever he's talking to me. Even across the house, which he used to get mad at us doing to him because he did it first. Made worse because of my hypersensitive hearing and new paranoid obsession with reading facial expressions to try and gauge people's moods to see if they were okay or a threat to me, I started being unsure about hearing whispers, which I wasn't sure were hallucinations in my head or if I was actually hearing them in real life.\n\n\n\n\nI was very avoidant of the other students, constantly walking around the school campus rather than settling down and eating. They used to bully me and one time I was repeatedly called a 'pedo' for agreeing to date another student to get another student to leave them alone. We were going to the same school, its just I was in grade 11 and they were in grade 8. This especially fucked me up because when I was younger and in primary school I would try and get peeks at other boys (given my father is homophobic and transphobic, you can imagine the psychological issues this built up when I realised what I was doing and why) in the changing rooms, whilst simultaneously trying to hide as much of my body as possible (I was uncomfortable with people looking at my exposed skin, in retrospect, signs of my gender identity not being binary or cis). \n\n\n\n\nWe eventually broke it off, because she was getting uncomfortable with the rumours that were happening because of it and it was starting to distress me a lot, being a teenager going through pubery, the effects of abuse, the psychological discord of trying to process things as an autistic person and questioning my sexuality in a toxic home environment due to my father's homophobia and transphobia (he made jokes about shooting same sex marriage supporters in response to a TV news report...). But it got really bad near the end of high school, I was threatened with a hammer by one of the school's seniors because I was trying to be sociable and I liked hanging around people at that point, I was trying to be positive about things you know? I reported it to the school which was... not the best plan. \n\n\n\n\nThe school didn't want to investigate, my mother called the school board a few times. My dad told me that 'bastardization is illegal' and that I just needed to keep my mouth shut. Being the currently highly stressed, suicidal and angry teenager I was, I was getting bullied in homeroom and I snapped and screamed I wanted to burn the entire school down with everyone trapped inside and laugh whilst it burned. I later was storming around that day, agitated and venting and one of my class' teachers, one I liked and trusted, noticed that I was upset and asked what was wrong and I... repeated the feelings I was having because of the school's fuckery.\n\n\n\n\nNaturally this later got me sent to the principal's office, because of course it fucking did. I got betrayed by the teacher I trusted the most (admittedly I don't blame her, I had already been suspended 3-4 times at this one school after all), and what ended up happening was the principal and vice principal proceeded to reduce me to tears by tearing away at my emotional armor, and making comments about needing to adjust my medication. Keep in mind I was already seeing a psychologist who specialised in ADHD and Autism and was trying to get me OFF medication. To say my mother was not happy was an understatement, but dad picked me up from school and was like \"I told you this would happen\". It was near finals. Luckily I wasn't expelled. My mother threatened to ruin the principal if she tried expelling me so close to the end of the year exams. \n\n\n\n\nBut one time on my suspension, dad took me to the local tip to dispose of some stuff. Dad insisted on just throwing it in the same part of the tip face because he couldn't be fucked. A council worker came over and was like 'no you can't do that'. Being the logical person I trusted the person who could get us into trouble with fines if we didn't follow directions. Dad didn't give a shit, he was confrontive, combatitive and he wanted to get out of there. I was in a panic and dumped a little of the stuff, dad demanded I get in the car which I did but... on the drive out of there. Dad screamed at me about how I was listening to the council worker over him and that he paid his rates and that the council worker was subservient to him, the rate payer and that clearly I enjoy being threatened with hammers. Yeah. YEAH. Grandma also made a joke about that, and they used to make jokes about my playing of video games and being a single virgin. \n\n\n\n\nLater on during my suspension, the police called, having investigated the incident due to my mother and was told that 'She understands how you feel, because she has a younger brother with autism', and that it wasn't the big metal hammer used in Manual Arts for hammering metal and pulling out nails, but a small plastic one. Even though it was clearly a fucking metal hammer. So I was being gaslit by the fucking police of all people. Clearly because this student was one of the Student Captains. Either way, I was allowed to go onto school grounds to take my finals and graduated with a pretty decent score for university all things considered.\n\n\n\n\nDad used to claim any time I messed up trying to do something because it was making me uncomfortable was that I was just trying to get back to my computer to play video games. I actually didn't play that many video games. Mostly chatted with online friends who were a great support line during my high school years but it was after the incident in the car that I started shutting down my emotions, I want to say? Well, eventually I had to get money somehow, and I signed up for the work seekers pension, which entailed going to a employment agency which specialised on people on the dole. I never really got a job, they never got responses back and I suspected they were sabotaging me because I heard stories of them doing that to keep getting government money. But one time dad was driving along the road to the agency which was several suburbs over (I would have had to catch the train otherwise) and dad was speeding. Dad got caught by a speed camera that was on a side road, shooting through bushes apparently. I never really saw it, but I was in the passenger seat.\n\n\n\n\nWhen dad got the ticket, he insisted on fighting it in court. Being the court system this meant it was held up for a while. Unfortunately this meant dad was constantly asking me what was happening that day, an event that was hazy at best, being made worse by all the memory issues I'd been having due to stress and anxiety of dealing with family dramas between each other. This continued for several months, with me growing more and more agitated when dad was getting annoyed at me struggling to remember and dad trying to look for any excuse to get off the ticket. In the end, dad noticed I wasn't keeping it together and didn't bother trying to call me as a witness when he represented himself. Turns out the judge got pissed off at him for constantly interrupting. Mom thinks he was trying to coach me to his advantage for the court case.\n\n\n\n\nA few more of those stupid incidents involving heavy lifting happened, namely tiles and me breaking them and him having to search for replacements. Or the dryer that broke a certain way from me opening the door too quickly and him ripping into me over other stuff I couldn't give a response to. Eventually I got put on the disability pension, being that I was considered sufficiently impaired, and was recommended a therapist due to various issues. But instead of properly venting about my abuse, it was always how my dad made me feel, or about how frustrations in my online friend groups were. I couldn't bring myself to talk about my abuse because I thought it was NORMAL and that this was normally how a family functioned. I was also afraid of telling him for fear of it getting back to my parents.\n\n\n\n\nAfter that I struggled feeling anything but a neutral state and any kind of emotion I'd feel was usually something really strong after so to speak 'breaking past the dullness', I think I was trying to protect myself by keeping my self numb to try and prevent any emotion-related impulses that might cause a drama. Mom started work contracts in other places and that left me and dad. Dad however was rather annoyed I was earning more on the disability pension than he was on his veteran's pension and actually frequently gaslit me on some bills, I'm pretty sure he was stealing from me and claiming mom was trying to con me on the power bills that I was putting forward to. Dad actually got a Carer's Pension for 'looking after me', but after my mom's second contract he started leaving the house for weeks at a time, expecting me to make big shopping lists to stock up the pantry and fridge. I had to learn how too cook around this time, mostly out of necessity but I insisted on complicated stuff. I also used to get frustrated that despite all the effort, dad would never give good feedback except 'it's good'. I also started feeling like a passenger in my own body, so I guess I was prone to 'dissociating' and tuning life out as well.\n\n\n\n\nYou can see I was trying too hard for dad's affection. It was 19-20 years at that point and I had never gotten an apology from him for that behaviour and or any real affection. I mean one time, dad didn't want to make dinner when I was a little kid when mom was at work. Dad got mad whenever I asked when dinner was. I didn't know how to use the microwave. That night mom came home around 11PM and learned I hadn't been fed yet. Dad later got lapband surgery around this time for his stomach to lose weight but refused to go on the diet, complaining whenever we ate red meat which he wasn't supposed to be, frequently eating ice cream before dinner, often times when I was preparing dinner no less. And used to complain we were tempting him and that he needed mom's co-operation to go on a diet because there was no way he was going to do it himself.\n\n\n\n\nFast forward later to like 3 years ago I wanna say? Christmas Eve. Mom found out from him that he had been cheating on her after she had visited a few times and he had been rather extremely hostile to her like he was trying to push her away. She called him. Whilst he was in the car with his mistress. And got the answer from him. Me and mom later hatched a plan to remove all our things from the house and move up north as we originally planned (which would have included him but clearly he didn't want it anymore). We managed to pull it off, escaping with the cats (our older one yells at me for food, whenever he did that when we lived with my dad, my dad would always scream at him to shut up and never get out of his chair, basically yelling and yelling at the cat until me or my mother got up out of our rooms which we were hiding in to feed them just to shut DAD up. My younger cat isn't that bad. But my older cat's yell makes me think of those times and I get angry and agitated) and our belongings whilst he was off away from the house for the week.\n\n\n\n\nWe lived with a... rather toxic landlord, we didn't know it at the time, she was just a narcissist like that. I got a text from dad basically saying that he was keeping the security deposit (which I never paid because I was family, mom never asked for a security deposit when I started paying board) and more or less didn't want to see me again. Dad later filed for divorce against my mother, mom refused to in order to force him to pay for it. Legal fuckery happened, at one point he tried to legally claim I was a 'capable and independent adult' despite... being my carer. We filed a DVO against him, and I had to get reference from my psych at the time. The letter I got given listed me as having Chronic Depression, Anhedonia, Suicidal Idealation, Anxiety, in addition to other stuff. I don't remember it all since the only copy was used as evidence for the order. A friend later explained the concept of C-PTSD to me after some venting about how my mother was acting towards me, and how I on some level hated her for my upbringing despite being the sole comforting pillar in my life.\n\n\n\n\nIt was an autism specialist therapist, but I later had a freakout over my body when I had a shower one time, realising something about my body that caused me massive distress. I think that was my first conscious experience of my dysphoria. It mulled in my head for a while as I tried to process my gender identity, trying to understand what my ideal body was because it kept shifting all the time between male, female, inbetween, neither. I later told my psychologist and... he was dismissive. Oh. Of course he wasn't exactly really helpful. Very pushy. Always telling me to do stuff and not really offering real solutions to these issues I was having. He also tried to basically turn a lot of the issues I was having on me, despite the very clear indications that my mother was lashing out at me because of the stress of dealing with my father's legal bullshit at the time. Or the fact I had actual triggers for specific memories. Nope just 'explain concept, here look at psychology journals' never really offering proper therapy.\n\n\n\n\nI started uni but had to pull out. We had to move. Our landlord wanted us out after apparently me investigating a noise caused me to see her and her date in the garage, and me not listening to her got her mad cus later her date didn't want to see her again. Given how much of a manipulative narcissist she was, I wouldn't be surprised if I wasn't a convenient excuse for the guy for my mere existence despite being explained as a tenant. We got an apartment, she later showed up and served us papers over her stupid fucking couch she tried to actively screw us over on by trying to force us to pay for more repairs than were needed and also removing it from the repair place we put it into. I later came out to my mother as biromantic asexual. \n\n\n\n\nThe thought of sex IRL actively terrifies me, but I seemed to be fine with art forms of it. Things were good until my mother got a new boyfriend. Stuff happened, he basically was trying to gaslight my mother. I threatened to call the cops, my mother being desperate for love took his side. I ran into my room and cried myself to sleep because she was going along with his abuse. Later next morning she basically told me if I had called the cops she'd have thrown me out (despite being on the lease and needing me for rent money). Stuff happened, a lot of strain was put on me and my mother's relationship, we found out he was an alcoholic narcissist prone to violent rages and lots of delusions and suffering acute liver failure. We eventually gave him the boot after spending too much money on him. I tried uni again in this timeframe but stopped it again because we were going to move down south to be with mom's family, which turns out this guy didn't even have the fucking money for because of how many lies he had told he believed them.\n\n\n\n\nFast forward to a few days ago. I'd been battling with questioning my gender identity for months, fearing my mother's reaction. Fearing that it would be 'the last straw' due to the stresses of having given birth to me. The fear of wanting to feel feminine on some level only because of my dad having wanted a daughter. The fear that it was a phase. The fear that it was all in my head despite the very clear distress that looking in a mirror now. The fear that this was normal to feel for someone who was autistic. I started getting deeper into reading fan fiction and stuff of series I liked, reading fan fiction of versions of characters of 'what if they were trans', to fill myself with some kind of certainty of my identity. Eventually stumbled onto some about a game that involved trauma in its themes, and I think that 'primed' me for it because of the feelings I felt felt similar to that of a game character's.\n\n\n\n\nNow I had always been prone to starving myself this entire time, and picking at scabs to prevent them healing because the feeling of the injury becoming anew felt good. But after exposing myself to that series, I started to feel more... emotional. That's when I got scratched by my cat at one point, and I found myself staring at the scratch and thinking about razors. I went looking for one in my bathroom. Thankfully we only had electric razors, well me at least. And electric razors didn't cut skin well, even when I pushed it into my hand. But the fact that I had gone that far sent me into a panic and I mulled over what I was doing, the distress over my gender identity and fearing mom's reaction got worse until I went out and... broke down and told her. Mom accepted me though. I told her I felt like a girl. She accepted me. I felt... extremely happy. Like way too happy. Like dangerously, no inhibitions happy. I was talking to her and having discussions with her on the balcony, and I kept looking off the edge, constantly thinking about 'what if I jump?', and thinking it in a way too happy mindset. A friend called that being manic, but I'm not bipolar. \n\n\n\n\nI had a shower to try and calm myself down, which I did and came out to my mother that I was nonbinary, that my gender identity was more complicated than what I had initially told her, and that I had days I drifted on my gender. She still accepted me. I got emotional again despite my normal levels. But the last few days, I've constantly been very emotional. And its hard to process. It's like I'm feeling all the emotions at once. Mom's not here anymore, since she was only here for a few days because she was on a work contract and she was visiting me because I had been alone with my thoughts for too long for 2 weeks and two weeks before that I had been alone for 6-7 weeks by myself.\n\n\n\n\nBut now it feels like whatever was blocking my other emotions is gone, and I'm feeling all the emotions all the time. I'm constantly feeling anxious, I'm constantly thinking back about all the stuff my dad did to me. Made worse by a heart to heart I had with my mother before she left about how I never got an apology from dad or that he never told me he loved me. I can't stop thinking about it and I get upset and distressed. And despite the numbness, thinking about my dad has always made me feel distressed but never have I felt this much distress. I can't look at myself in a mirror anymore and I keep finding myself walking towards the balcony of my mother's room without thinking on impulse and its terrifying me. I've also recently switched to decaf, since I used to drink like several 750mL double strength iced coffees a day or like 6-7 cups of instant espresso. I cared more about the taste than the caffeine, and I wonder if caffeine withdrawl is making it even worse.\n\n\n\n\nIs it normal to just become a complete and utter wreck and relive traumatic stuff you want to escape after an extremely happy moment like coming out about gender identity and being accepted? Like you are numb for a long time and suddenly your emotional feelings are back and you are struggling to function because you can't stop thinking about all the stuff you've been through. I'm 26 and I'm distressed now that my mother's gone too and I'm worried if this is normal? It's not helped that this helpless feeling of like I am a child still, like a small child stuck in a body too old for what its used to and the realization that I am this old and desperately wanting to escape back to my childhood and do things differently to try and get a better outcome.\n\n\nI'm going to start uni again soon and I was thinking of getting a referral to another therapist that's actually LGBT friendly?",

    "selftext": "When I was younger, maybe between the ages of 11 and 18, I would regularly use Omegle to seek out grown men and would sexually interact with them through chatting, sending explicit images and often videos of myself doing sexually degrading things. I essentially self produced child pornography. I'm not sure why I did it, I'm actually a lesbian and I don't think I was ever hugely pressured, but I think I felt these men were giving me a positive input when I wasn't receiving much at the time. I remember that I would be afraid things would be leaked, and every time after I was done I felt so ashamed of myself but I would continue anyway.\nIt was always something I completely blamed myself for, and never considered that it was at least a little abusive or that it might have actually affected me until recently when it suddenly hit me that if a child that age was in that situation and told me about it I would be incredibly alarmed. I've also realised that very often people who seek out children online that way save the clips, not only for their own use but often for distribution. With the amount I did it, I would say it is very unlikely that none of the things I sent out weren't used like this. Whenever I think about it, all I can really feel is shame and self-loathing for the fact I was so stupid.\nTo be honest, I don't feel as though I'm allowed to say what happened was neither traumatic nor sexual abuse, and I would feel like an imposter if I were to claim as such. I'm not really sure what I'm looking for here, opinions maybe? I don't know. Any input is welcome, sorry for the ramble",

    "selftext": "(disclaimer: sry for maybe weird english, as it's not my native language)\n\nWhen I was 16, I had a boyfriend... Not my first one, but the FIRST one (you know what I mean). It wasn't the best relationship... More an on off thing. Anyways, when we were together for the third (and last) time, we went on a trip to visit his grandparents. They lived in a nice house in the middle of nowhere.   On the third day his grandparents went out to visit some friends, and the cousin of my boyfriend came over.   We had a BBQ and went swimming. It was a nice afternoon, my ex and his cousin were talking very much, and I did not realize (or didn't want to) they were stearing at my breasts for minutes...When we went back into the house, we started a game of Poker (not that I had any idea of how poker works...), and after some shits and giggles, my Ex came up with ‚Äûspicing things up‚Äú by plaing strippoker. I wasn't very eager to do so, but on the other hand, his cousin has seen me in my swimwear, so after making clear that I won't take my underwear off, we went on with it...Things got a little weird for me, as one could clearly see, that his cousin was hard. I thought to myself: ‚ÄûJust don't look, just don't make it awkward...‚Äú, but I wanted to stop playing, as I was wearing only my bra and a slip.   ‚ÄûYou know, my cousin never had a girlfriend before.‚Äú my Ex said and i replied ‚Äûaha...‚Äú I mean, what would anyone else have said?   My ex started fumble around on my bra. ‚ÄûYou could let him touch your tits... You know, so he knows how to handle tits...‚Äú I was baffled, and shook my head... Everything started to blurr and I just wanted to get away, but couldn't get up... I wanted to run, but where...   My ex opened my bra. ‚ÄûDo it for me honey.‚Äú   They both touched my breasts and I wanted them to stop, but was in shock. I couldn't say a word, nor move... I didn't do anything when my ex grabbed my shoulders and pushed me back. His cousin started touching my pus\\*\\* and i said no again... They ignored it.   I told them to stop, and that I don't want them to do this... I continued telling them, while my ex masturbated, watching, as his cousin f\\*cked me.   He just told me, that I'm a good girl, for giving his cousin some ‚Äûpractice lessons‚Äú... I was disgusted... By him, by his cousin, by myself...After his cousin was finished, my ex wasn't... He f\\*cked me, even though i didn't want him touching me ever again.About 30 minutes later, his cousin left, not without a hug for my ex...   Later, at night, I tried to sleep, but couldn't, so I pretended to sleep. That wouldn't keep my ex from waking me up and f\\*ck me again... I hated him. I hated him so much... I hated his cousin, and I hated myself...I've never told anyone about it. Not even my partner, whom I met when I was 18... I've always been afraid of sentences like ‚Äûwell you shouldn't have played strippoker‚Äú or ‚Äûyou should have made it more clear...‚Äú or ‚Äûwell, just because you don't like it threeway...‚ÄúI am 34, and I am still afraid...",

    "selftext": "I am wondering if a potentially traumatic experience I went through is what is causing my hypertonic pelvic floor. I am have a number of health issues due to my tight pelvic floor.  \n\nLong explanation below. \nSo I never really thought of this as a traumatic experience because I just tried to push on from it but maybe it was?  I got married this January and 15 minutes after our ceremony was over, a valet guy approach my husband and I to come outside because there was a medical emergency. It was my aunt (my dad‚Äôs sister) she was on a bench moaning and foaming at the mouth. My uncle (dads brother) had her head in his hands. We watched her head go limp in his hands my uncle looked at us with terror in his eyes frantically asking us ‚Äúomg what do we do, what do we do?!?!‚Äù.  I froze. My husband thought quickly and ran in and grabbed his groomsman whose a nurse. A bunch of other nurses came out too. There was nothing they could do really but get her on the ground and monitor her slowing pulse. I just knew it was bad. Like I just watched her basically die.  Also the other fucking valet handed me her cellphone to speak to 911.  I was a mess. I was so fucking angry the first people those valet thought to go to\nFor help was the bride and groom!!! üò°üò°üò°. An ambulance came and my aunt and her husband went to hospital. But anyway the show must go on. People sent us back inside to mingle with our guests during cocktail hour like nothing happened.  We were told we had to have fun. We can‚Äôt feel guilty. I lost all my appetite.  I threw up later in the evening. Then during father daughter dance I saw my parents table and my aunt and uncle and my mom all stood up crying and hugging and their cousins and everyone but my mom rushed out and left the reception. I knew it was really bad and no one would tell me what happened the entire night. As if they were protecting me but I already knew she was dead or almost dead.  Found out the next day she had a major brain aneurysm and was brain dead upon arrival to hospital. That confirmed that we basically watched her go brain dead.\nHer husband needs a a kidney transplant badly and he was supposed to get one of hers, which was a silver lining. Then the story changed to none of her organs are viable. So it was all for nothing.  Saturday was our wedding and Monday I went to the hospital to say my goodbyes. And it‚Äôs such a hard concept for me. Someone on life support with no brain activity - I wonder if the essence of what makes them who they are is gone or if it‚Äôs stuck in their body somewhere. Was a difficult thing for me especially knowing she was a DNR - this is exactly what she wanted to avoid. \n\nBut anyway I didn‚Äôt eat, only was able to stomach a little alcohol. I forced myself to have fun because I didn‚Äôt really have an option. We paid $30,000+ to have our dream wedding that we planned over an entire year. It was absolutely perfect too except for that event. I‚Äôm so angry my special day was taken from me in the way that the joy was zapped.  After our ceremony I was on cloud 9, so euphoric, so happy and excited it‚Äôs hard to put into words. Within 15 min that was gone. We couldn‚Äôt even get to cocktail hour without the valet pulling us outside. I‚Äôm angry but then I feel guilty because my aunt died and she didn‚Äôt do it on purpose.  She was so excited for the wedding and I didn‚Äôt even get to see her.  I wish this all happened the next day. I have such mixed feelings about my wedding day and it sucks! \n\nThen we go on our honeymoon to try and escape from it all and I get food poisoning and I‚Äôm sick for most of the trip which sucked. Then we went back to normal life and I just felt stressed all the time for no reason. I was going to the gym trying to lose weight and exercising hard and that wasn‚Äôt working and that was depressing me.  I just felt like I was on level 10 all the time.\n\nI always carried my tension in my neck but my neck wasn‚Äôt tight for the past few months which was odd. Then I started having all these health issues that landed me in physical therapy for a hypertonic pelvic floor.\n\nIs this considered traumatic or just something bad that happened?  Could all of this stress/trauma have gotten stored in my pelvic floor for some reason?",

That really upset me as I didn‚Äôt think it had anything to do with that (although if it had, aren‚Äôt my feelings still real?) and it felt like my feelings were being minimised. I told him I didn‚Äôt like that but he kept going and just treating me like a baby as if he thought it was funny I was behaving like that. \n\n\nHe turned the lights off to go to bed but I started crying as it took me back to when my feelings weren‚Äôt believed in childhood and how much it hurts when the person you love doesn‚Äôt care you‚Äôre hurting. He heard me crying and tried hugging me but I was feeling so upset I decided to sleep on the couch. He‚Äôs a great boyfriend and we‚Äôve been together for a long time but I just wished he was more sensitive/ took my feelings seriously. I wish he could have embraced me as if he cared and was worried about me. Instead of hugging me while on his phone. \n\nSometimes I wonder if you haven‚Äôt gone through trauma do you have a smaller emotional range and can‚Äôt understand someone who has a bigger one? I just feel so alone. Normally I am very open and honest with him but this just makes me want to say nothing about how I really feel from now on in case im seen as a cry baby or needy. \n\nHe did come to me on the couch to try and convince me back but I just said I needed space for now. This doesn‚Äôt affect my love for him but I just needed to vent and wondered if anyone else has found themselves in a similar position?",

    "title": "In-laws Created Trauma Experience And Now Want Kindness",
    "selftext": "We're going through mediation with my in-laws in hopes to reconcile after a massive breach of trust and events that created a traumatic experience for me, about 8 weeks after my husband and I got married, and coincided with us finding out we were unexpectedly pregnant.\n\nTheir other son had threatened to kill me and he had done some other really crappy things at our wedding like cutting in on the mother son dance. Most things happened while he had been drinking heavily. Parents didn't hold him accountable. Right after my husband and I got married, drunk son manufactured a complaint against us (literally, he told us not to talk to his girlfriend, then apparently changed his mind and complained to his parents that we weren't talking to his girlfriend). Parents made a huge deal of it that I was \"ignoring\" the girlfriend (no, we would smile from across the room but neither of us said anything to each other) and insisted we all go talk to a priest to \"mediate\" the situation. The priest, raged at me for ignoring the girlfriend, saying I was the hostess at my rehearsal dinner. The priest also excused all the brother's drunken antics, saying with a dismissive wave, \"oh we all get a little drunk sometimes.\" It was SUCH a biased mediation. The next day, I ran into the priest outside of the church and he approached me and asked how things went and when I told him I didn't think that he could erase years of hurt in one evening, the priest lost it and started screaming at me about how I was tearing apart my husband's family until I was crying so hard he pulled me, by my arm, inside his office where he continued to berate me until I composed myself enough to get up and walk out. Then, a few days later, the day we found out we were pregnant, my in-laws took us aside at a camping trip and basically took their drunk son's side and shaming us about the situation with drunk son. They were concerned for my husband, who was really stressed and asked what was going on and he told me to tell them about our pregnancy, which they responded really poorly to and shamed us and told us we weren't ready and that we shouldn't have done that. Mind you, we were married, living independently, and we were financially independent. So my husband ended up with a mixture of anxiety and depression and wasn't able to supporte during the pregnancy or really, much at all in the last decade. The family stress continued for 7 years before we cut contact with drunk brother and then his parents started harassing my husband about our boundary and making it so we couldn't have family around us in a supportive way. An uncle involved himself this fall (not the first time but definitely a 'last straw' event) and my husband basically cut contact with his parents (who played a role in the uncle's crap).\n\nThe trauma seems to be caused by the verbal abuse and betrayal of the priest (he was the one who had prepared us for our marriage) and betrayal by my in-laws (who were supportive of us prior to our wedding), plus my husband's inability to stand up for me because he was such an emotional wreck. And it went on for 7 years before we stepped back to take space, but my husband was adamantly opposed to me taking that space from drunk brother and requiring that our young kids have that space too.\n\nNow, they want \"kindness\" and \"forgiveness.\"\n\nI'm still trying to get my life put back together. So is my husband. I don't have panic attacks anymore, but the trauma has literally changed my brain and I am absolutely still in the thick of trying to recover from it. We've spent hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars trying to heal from all this. Our house is a cluttered reflection of our mental health too.\n\nAnd MIL is complaining about boundaries like that we asked them to limit their Christmas gifts to one per kid (we have 4 kids so gifts multiply exponentially) and requesting that they not ask our kids what *Santa* got them for Christmas since we don't do Santa (asking them what they got for Christmas/what they want for Christmas instead). And asking if I, the person who searched for the mediator AND did ALL the coordination work with the mediator AND participated fully in the process, am invested in the mediation process. You know, as opposed to drunk brother who doesn't drink much these days, but had pushed back mediation by weeks so that it then interfered with our vacation.\n\nI'm over here with requests like can you just stop talking about me behind my back to relatives and stop taking sides in disagreements between your kids?",

    "title": "Stop living the life other people want for you - you‚Äôll never satisfy them",
    "selftext": "I stumbled across a video recently of a nurse who spent her career giving palliative care to people at the end of their lives - she wrote a book about the most common regrets that people have on their deathbed. Top of the list is that they wished they‚Äôd lived their lives as their true selves, not the person that they thought other people wanted them to be. We‚Äôve all felt that way sometimes - that we‚Äôre putting on a mask in order to fit in, we‚Äôre not following our own path.  Its important to take a step back and understand why this happens.\n\nHuman beings are social animals - we do what we can to get by and to survive we need to be a part of a wider society. Other folks have expectations about how things should be and how people should act. We grew with those people in our families, at school, we see them in our workplace.  We are those people too - we have our own values and beliefs that put pressure on other folks to behave in a certain way. Most of these are fairly benign and encourage ethical behaviour but we can be influenced by this pressure by degrees over a long period of time to the point where we feel we‚Äôre living someone else‚Äôs life. You can look in the mirror and ask yourself, how did I get here?\n\nThe answer is that our fear of being judged shifts us a little bit every day and its critical on who you choose to spend your time with. You want to surround yourself with people who are kind, and who will listen when you need to share something without judgement. Its is entirely reasonable for you to take a step back from harmful relationships where you are judged harshly for simply being who you are.\n\nWhere does their judgement come from and how can we prevent it from pushing us in a particular direction? When we are being unfairly judged by someone else, we naturally feel anxious and our perspective on the world narrows until all of our attention is spend on things we‚Äôve done in the past. Its reasonable of course for people to feed back - we want to get feedback from other people - but when this is hypercritical and delivered in an unkind way that's not OK. This is what starts shifting who we are into something else, what the other person wants us to be.\n\nIts important to stop, breathe, take a step back and see what's really going on. When people judge others harshly, it tends to come from their own fears and insecurities, brought about by damaging experiences in their past and traumas shared across generations. You can look at that person who‚Äôs judging you, see their suffering and wish them happiness and pace. \n\nInitially that may be very difficult to do - you may feel a great deal of anger towards them. But developing understanding for the circumstances that led them to judge harshly and feeling compassion for their suffering is the only way to let go of your own fear and resentments and start to feel comfortable in your own skin.\n\n[Listen On Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/being-happy-just-being-you-follow-your-own-path/id1493806566?i=1000543945419)\n\n[Listen On Google Podcasts](https://www.google.com/podcasts?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9hbmNob3IuZm0vcy8xMjNkZThlMC9wb2RjYXN0L3Jzcw==)\n\n[Listen On Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/1ozwIEgzEtHQezPoi83nVV)\n\n[Other ways to listen](https://anchor.fm/shaun-donaghy/episodes/Being-happy-just-being-you---follow-your-own-path-e1b85hc)",

I have never told anyone what I'm about to spill here.\n\nI am turning 25 this year (M) and becoming a quarter in the gay world is stupidly a thing. I'm well behind my peers in body count and experience and I don't really care about that on its own. However, I would be lying if I didn't say that the biggest reason is because sex and anxiety are like twin sisters in my world. I have fainted, I zone out, I check out, I lose erections, I talk needlessly - you name the anxious bed habit, I have probably done it at least once. This part I've told people before.\n\nI vividly remember being very young (maybe 3 or 4) and watching my parents have sex from the foot of their door with my little sister next to me. I remember the position, the sounds, everything. At some point, my sister and I took our clothes off and literally jumped in. I don't know what my sister did but I jumped on my father's back. I remember him reaching back to grab me. That's the end of the memory. I have never told anyone this. It was never spoken about (to my recollection).\n\nFast forward to elementary school, grade 4/5. This is my earliest memory of being attracted to other boys. From grade 5 to the middle of grade 7, I was bullied and sexually assaulted by some of the boys in my class. They would surround me at recess and all make a bunch of sex noises and poke me with sticks and rub themselves up against me. Kids would gather and laugh, I sat there and did nothing usually. The name calling was part and parcel. The boy I had a crush on grabbed me at the end of the day one day and just started humping me. He was erect and laughed at me at the same time (weird kink but okay). It stopped when I moved schools (parents divorced, it was messy) and I didn't mention this to a single soul until I was 19.\n\nSo here's my need, here's why I am posting: I met a guy. We've been talking for almost 8 months. He's not like other guys I've been with. I want to have sex with him and if we continue down our current set path, that is going  to happen. I want a relationship with him. I want to give him the best of me. We've talked about some of this stuff, so he knows sex isn't easy for me. Two weekends ago, we spent two days like nudists, smoking and kissing and cuddling, and for the first time in probably my whole life, I was able to let someone touch me and not also be painfully in my head about it. I did almost faint at one point but he was very good about it. I made him cum and then we went to get food - talk about bliss. It was magical.\n\nI just want to enjoy myself. Let my shoulders down, relax, enjoy myself. Will I ever have that? Or is this just a part of me for good?",

    "selftext": "I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, or if I should even be talking about it online.\n\nI'm an 18 year old guy, and my parents divorced when I was 12. I was separated from my dad and brother when I was 14, and I've been living in a void ever since.\n\nBoth of my parents have psychological issues. A brief description of my mom would be controlling, manipulative, and stressful. My dad on the other hand is an anomaly. He grew up on a farm, his dad beat him with a belt, he went through highschool as the \"rebel\" (in the 80s, metalhead scene.) He's been married 3 times, divorced 3 times, and went off to war twice.\n\nAs me and my brother were growing up, you honestly couldn't have told us apart from any other kid. We were happy, playful, didn't have a problem in the world.\n\nAfter my dad came home from deployment, he started drinking excessively. I was 9 years old when he started forcing me and my brother to do chores for him. It wasn't something to teach us discipline as much as it was free child labor. Whenever we forgot to clean something, or even SWEEP, he would start screaming at us. We joke about it now, he would get passive aggressive, only there wasn't anything passive about it. Full on aggressive sarcasm, the worst vocal/mental abuse any child in the world could ever suffer. I even came home a few times to him hurting my brother, whether it was holding him by the throat 5 feet in the air, or sitting ontop of him and strangling him.\n\nNow that I'm 18 and becoming more conscious of my surroundings, I'm realizing that I need to get as far away from them as possible. Both of them lived extremely difficult lives, and expect us to lead the same, unspeakably stressful paths that they did. To elaborate, I should be in highschool right now, and I'm in college. I'm developing a stress ulcer, confirmed by BOTH PARENTS, and they caused me to have 2 panic attacks in a day. Who does that?\n\nAt this point, the only thing I can do is give an example.\n\n\"Hey dad, I couldn't find my class and I think I'm going to call in. I'm too stressed out right now and really just need help.\"\n\n\"Okay, well while you're at it, why don't you drop out completely? OHHH! And I can buy you some pot, and you can curl in your blankie and play videogames for the rest of your life! How does that sound?\"\n\nHere you can see me clearly asking for help, even just words of encouragement, and my dad takes it WAY out of proportion. It's no wonder I've developed a stress related ulcer, these are the people that RAISED me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt this point, I just feel like a lost cause. The two only people in the entire world who I share blood with, that are supposed to be helping me get ready for life on my own, are pushing me away, abusing me, making life harder and worse, and getting confused when I say that I can't take it any more. They won't even let me give up. I talked to family in another state, and asked if I could run away and move down there. I was talking about MOMENTS NOTICE, because that's what family does right?\n\nMy dad called them too, and told them I was overreacting and he has it under control. My dad told them that I should STAY in college, and FACE THIS HEAD ON!\n\nI've been doing that and only that until this point, where I actually considered my physical and mental health, and now I realize that instead of worrying about college 3 days in advance, if I just *don't worry at all,* suddenly everything becomes *9999999x easier.* Isn't it crazy how when you deal with things with happiness instead of negativity, they go by way smoother? Isn't that something that us humans realized like, oh I don't know, 10,000 years ago? Ooga booga rock sharp, maybe wrap in leaves?\n\nI'm sorry for the long read. At this point, I could run away, kill myself, none of it matters to me. I'm trapped, there is no option B. I'm forced to be around the people who made my life hell, and I can't even think for myself any more because of them. Every time I do, they just scream into my ear and all my own thoughts flood away.\n\nI think I've developed a serious psychological disorder, but fortunately for me, my parents don't believe in mental health. I'm just a pussy for trying to get my head in order!",

To clarify, she was specifically talking about abuse that would cause trauma. She says that anyone who says they had a \"normal\" or \"good\" childhood is lying. \n\nI know that no one is perfect and that parents will make mistakes, but is this true? Does everyone just continue to perpetuate the cycle of abuse? Is it even possible to break the cycle and raise well adjusted children? Is it possible for humans to not have traumatic/abusive childhoods? I've always wanted to have kids some day, but if I'm just going to mess my kids up too, I don't know if I ever want to have them. I don't want to make any other human experience the pain and mental disorders I have. I don't want the cycle of abuse my family has had for generations to continue. \n\n**Tl;Dr: Is it even possible to break the cycle of abuse and raise well adjusted children?

    "selftext": "Thought I'd post a little success story here!\n\nMy bedroom has been in a terrible state since jr high. For context I'm in my second year of university. I was in an abusive friendship for most of my life, and in jr high I lost all motivation to clean my room, and it got quite bad. Up until recently I was only going to my bed, and left a small trail from the door to my bed but that was it. I sometimes left food out and that attracted beetles, and now I have a small phobia of them and their larvae, which made cleaning even harder, because I was so afraid I would find them in my room if I cleaned.\n\nOver the years I made tiny little bits of progress, but I always stopped before I got to the hard parts. I was able to clean around my bed and move it across the room, but a whole half of my room hasn't been touched in years. Until recently!\n\nThis winter I've really been trying to make more progress, and since I know the life cycle of the beetles I know I won't find them in the winter so that's made things easier! I've also started therapy and that's motivating me to clean as well. I still have a ways to go and I have to find time to make a run to donate stuff, because there's stuff in here from grade 7 that I still haven't gotten rid of, but I'm setting clear goals and making huge strides and it feels fantastic! \n\nIt's so good to stand in the middle of my room. It's so good to stand on my floor with bare feet and not worry about beetles. It's so good to be able to lie down on my floor!! And to not have boxes piled in my room! And to look at all of this and know that I did it, I got past the mental block and cleared that bit of my room! And I can do the rest and it's going to be clean and it's going to be a space I can feel in control of! \n\nAnyways, if you're struggling with a depression room and are having trouble getting yourself to clean it, I know it's scary, I know it's embarrassing, but you've got this. Take it one bit at a time. Take breaks when you need to. Even if you just go around and pick up the garbage, or bag some clothes for donation, or vacuum a corner that really needs it, every little bit counts. And you have nothing to be ashamed of.",

As someone who grew up in catholic school, in a catholic household, I always wanted to wait until marriage or at least until I was with someone I loved so much that I dream of marrying them. But then hormones took over, and every guy I tried to date just wanted my body, so I opened up to oral but was very strict about no sex. This man told me he respected that, but then said he could see my body wanting it when he rubbed his head on my clit and entrance and then he just stuck it in. First of all, I never wanted him to rub it, I even said ‚ÄúRemember, I‚Äôm not on birth control‚Äù ‚ÄúRemember, I‚Äôm not ready yet‚Äù and he told me not to worry, that it wasn‚Äôt inside, it was ‚Äújust the head‚Äù.

I‚Äôve just been trying to accept that it happened and grieve for myself as the little girl it happened to.\n\nI know I need to talk to my therapist about all of it, but I‚Äôve been putting it off for weeks because my job was so stressful. I wanted to wait until summer break when I had as much time to myself as possible to have a breakdown if it came to that. \n\nBut now it‚Äôs summer break, my appointment is tomorrow, and I‚Äôm absolutely terrified. I don‚Äôt want to talk about it at all with anyone ever. I know that I need to, but the thought is excruciating.\n\nPart of this stems from the fact that I don‚Äôt know what will happen. Do DBT therapists usually work with trauma? I think the scariest thing would be if she told me I must be misremembering or trying to victimize myself and that it likely never even happened. (To be clear, I have a wonderful therapist who has never said anything like this to me and has *always* validated how I‚Äôm feeling.)\n\nIt would be great to hear if anyone has experience with the shock of realizing they have severe childhood trauma and how explaining it to a therapist usually goes. I *know* I need to do this, but I‚Äôm so scared.",

    "title": "Happiness can feel like it's outside our control - but you have more influence than you realise",
    "selftext": "The four noble truths of the Buddha are simple to express: suffering is part of life, but happiness is possible and we make choices in every moment that lead us to happiness / suffering. The reason its revolutionary is that it paints a picture where our happiness isn‚Äôt an external factor that's outside of our control, it‚Äôs something that‚Äôs within our reach with some practice, some patience and some persistence.\n\nWhich is not to say that you should beat yourself up for not being happy - its as important to practice non-judgement for yourself as for others, because every person you see if doing the best they can given their circumstances, including you.\n\nSo how do we train ourselves to be happy? The first step is to focus on the positive.  This might not be where our minds go automatically - humans have a natural negativity bias, a leftover from our our evolution where we‚Äôre more focused on where there might be wolves than where there‚Äôs flowers. This is completely understandable as it kept us alive for thousands of years but its something we need to be aware of when living our modern lives. Social media is very focused on the negative because that‚Äôs what grabs our attention. Research shows that consuming any kind of media that is mostly negative affects our mental health. So we need to be careful what we consume.\n\nWe can also make a choice in every moment to focus on the good things we have and be grateful for them rather than seeing what we don‚Äôt have or what‚Äôs wrong. This takes time and patience as we might be very used to focusing on the negative. I live in Britain and we love to have a moan, especially about the weather but it‚Äôs within our gift to appreciate the great things that are all around and regularly meditate on them or capture them in a gratitude journal. On the flip side can notice our judgmental thoughts arise, listen to them without getting involved or judging and watch them pass without acting on them. This is how we train ourselves to focus on the positive.\n\nThe second step is smiling to your difficulties. This sounds absolutely crazy - why would you want to smile when things are difficult? There's two reasons - the first is neurological. When you smile, even if you don‚Äô;t feel like smiling, your brain releases chemicals which reduce stress and lift your mood - so its a very easy way to change how you‚Äôre feeling. That's why we gently smile while we meditate.\n\nThe other way smiling helps is that it reduces the power those difficulties have over you in your mind. When we see anger, anxiety and sadness as our enemies that rob us of our peace then (naturally) we‚Äôre afraid of them - we try and block out the thoughts and we run to consumption to help us out, which of course never works in the long term. When we smile to our difficulties, our difficult emotions and say, ‚Äúthere you are, my old friend‚Äù, we accept what we‚Äôre feeling without judgement, we reduce our suffering.\n\n[Listen On Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/training-yourself-to-be-happy/id1493806566?i=1000518442780)\n\n[Listen On Google Podcasts](https://www.google.com/podcasts?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9hbmNob3IuZm0vcy8xMjNkZThlMC9wb2RjYXN0L3Jzcw==)\n\n[Listen On Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/1ozwIEgzEtHQezPoi83nVV)\n\n[Other ways to listen](https://anchor.fm/shaun-donaghy/episodes/Training-yourself-to-be-happy-evial3)",

    "selftext": "Today, I found a journal of mine from middle school. It was a bittersweet experience because I can read the depression in my words, but can also tell my self-confidence was still intact.\n\nSo, my family moved from NYC to KC. With this move, I was forced to leave behind the people I trusted most and the ability to do anything other than be alone in my room while outside of school. My journal entries involve me trying to stay positive even though I felt so alone and isolated. \n\nWhat pains me most reading my entries is knowing what was to come. Trauma that led to suppressed memories and undiagnosed depression and anxiety. \n\nI remember seeking help from the school‚Äôs counselor in high school. I confided to him I was suicidal which prompted my family being notified. Although I was scared, I was relieved I would finally get help.\n\nHowever, that did not happen. My mother was concerned, but my father wrote it off. They didn‚Äôt help me get therapy even though the counselor highly recommended it and I can‚Äôt remember when the counselor stopped checking in on me.\n\nIt‚Äôs been 8 years and neither of my parents have ever checked in once with me to ask about my state of mind or mental health. It feels as though they just moved on with their lives because they decided me having suicidal thoughts wasn‚Äôt important enough to be bothered by.\n\nI just feel so much anger in my heart. So much anger that it hurts. I sometimes feel guilty for not wanting a close relationship with them because I want to believe they‚Äôve changed. But, that thought is always immediately followed by me remembering that they‚Äôve never even once shown interest in learning about me as a person. Their half-assed attempts of asking me about my life lead to one of two outcomes which are 1)criticism and judgement 2)lack of genuine interest. \n\nI‚Äôm not in search of anything in specific with this post other than to air my heart out. I no longer want to live holding on to pain in my heart, but I don‚Äôt know how to fully let it go. \n\nAccording to Psychology Today, ‚ÄúForgiveness is the release of resentment or anger.‚Äù I want to get there. I really am trying, but I‚Äôm just still hurt by the idea that I don‚Äôt feel a familial bond when I think of my parents. I just see them as two adults I know. \n\nIf you‚Äôve made it this far, thank you so much for your ‚Äúlistening ear.‚Äù I appreciate it more than you know whether or not you respond to this post.\n\nCheers to better days ahead! I appreciate you all. <3",

I've suffered depression myself. I've recommended talking to the GP and seeing what the health service can offer before trying other routes. Of course, I'm there for her, but actually we live very far apart and I'm not able to be close to her right now due to corona.

    "selftext": "So, I have always acknowledged that this thing happened to me, but I was always just so nonchalant about it in conversation. But now, the circumstances of my life have made me rethink just how much it might have affected me. \n\nWhen I was 7 or 8 (sometime in the summer of 2008), I was at a big public pool with my father and little brother. It was the kind of pool that had two shallow ends with a big deep end in the middle, and a *giant* diving board. I mean that thing was reeeally tall. I was eight though. \n\nOn this particular day I remember swimming around people‚Äôs legs with goggles on or something because I could see clearly. I don‚Äôt remember if this part is real or from the dreams/nightmares after, but I remember the water being purple. I remember being weirded out. And I wasn‚Äôt the only one who noticed something was wrong. \n\nPeople were quickly ordered out of the water by the lifeguards and they dove underwater and retrieved a young girl (I can‚Äôt remember if she was like 12 or much younger, my dad and I think a young teen). The purple water was blood. She must‚Äôve dove off the board and hit her head, and then drowned. The ambulance was there soon after and they took her away but it was clear that she was dead. Her whole body was covered up. I remember sitting under a cabana with my dad and brother, looking at all the people around us who were just staring at the ambulance in complete *silence*, wrapped in towels. I didn‚Äôt consider at the time that one of those groups were her family members. \n\nI don‚Äôt think it really hit me for a while what happened. I mean, I said before; I kind of just spent the next 10 years going ‚Äúoh yeah someone died at **** Pool when I was there!‚Äù in casual conversation about the area. But I definitely had dreams about it and realized that I had been *swimming in a dead girl‚Äôs blood*. It didn‚Äôt creep me out until this year. I told my dad that I remember it happening and he has corroborated this whole story. He remembers blood too. \n\nAnyway, the reason I think this is a problem; when I was 15-16 I started to develop homicidal and suicidal thoughts. I also have depression, but that‚Äôs less related. I never had any idea why I was getting such awful homicidal ideation when I‚Äôd never had a traumatic experience and never liked morbid things like that. I showed no signs of psychopathy or anything that I thought could cause them. This last year I‚Äôve been wondering if this memory of swimming in someone‚Äôs blood that has been in my head since 8 years old could be a factor, and it honestly feels a bit comforting. I feel less like everything in my head is random, if you understand me. \n\nAnyway, I just felt like I had to let this all out. My mom doesn‚Äôt like talking about this stuff and none of my family know about the homicidal thoughts. I was also wondering if anyone had any similar effects after weird childhood traumas like mine, and how to deal with them. \n\nThank you if you listened!",

There are a lot of triggers for me. Anyone that‚Äôs pregnant with a girl. Seeing mothers and their daughters, especially if they‚Äôre around the same age my daughter should have been. I guess I‚Äôm just having hard time accepting and moving forward. \nAny advice, solidarity or reassurance is welcome. \nThank you if you read this far!",

    "selftext": "Today my mother called me to confess that she stole the dollar.  Her confession has me wondering again if abusers act intentionally or if they're just stupid people doing stupid things.\n\nAbout 20 years ago, my sister, mother, and I were all called before our abuser because a dollar was missing.  I was bewildered, I couldn't believe my sister and/or mother would do something so stupid.  Even worse, I couldn't believe neither of them would confess. \n\nOne by one, we were interrogated in front of each other.  We were directly asked who took the dollar, where it was spent, etc.  When none of us turned on the other, we were isolated and interrogated individually for the whole day.  I could hear the shouting coming from the other rooms.  I couldn't believe they were going to blame *me* for something I didn't do.  It was emotionally exhausting.\n\nWe each had to make a list of where we thought the others spent the dollar so we could go into town and ask for the dollar back.  And, well, we went into town to those places, and asked for the dollar back.  We never got the dollar - no one knew what we were talking about.\n\nThis specific episode - the hunt for the dollar - has really stuck with me as core memory because it was one of the first real crazy moments in the run-up to some of my most traumatic experiences.  I shared this with my sister and she, in turn, shared it with my mother.  My mother never realized what her children were experiencing.\n\nToday my mother told my sister that *my mother* stole the dollar to buy food.  \n\nNow that I'm well removed from that environment, I'm horrifically aware of how that episode, and others like it, were very severe episodes of abuse and social violence.  These interrogations served to pit me against my mother and sister, and vice-versa.  This odd \"walk into town and ask for the dollar back\" served to isolate us from the community.  On their face, the \"who took the dollar\" game appears almost *designed* to break up family bonds.\n\nWas this abuser acting intentionally or was he just responding to environmental conditions -- is he evil or cursed?  I'm afraid he's just cursed, floating through life as a demonstration of great male chauvinism that any person dropped into his conditions/circumstances would be doomed to re-enact.  It's not really a satisfying or reassuring thought. \n\nHas anyone had similar thoughts?  Is there any good research or reading on this topic that you'd recommend?  \n\nThanks for reading :)",

She always wanted to hang out with my dog (so she can torment her) and my family would make me let her. One day when she was with my dog in the living room and I was in my room I heard my dog yelp. It was a terrible yelp and I immediately rushed into the living room and saw my cousin on top of my puppy with a body pillow over it. She was (still is) an overweight child so I was horrified thinking my puppy was crushed. I ran over and tried pulling her off but she had her legs wrapped around the pillow that was over my puppy. I had to basically tackle her off the pillow. My dog wasn‚Äôt moving and I, not thinking went into a frenzy. I started hitting my cousin close fist and kicking her until her mom came all the way from her room and started beating the shit out of me with a tv remote. To be honest I wish I got to beat that brat even more. My dog was still breathing unknown to me luckily, but 2 years later my family made me let my cousin take my dog for a walk around the block unsupervised and my cousin came back not ten minutes later without my dog.

We knew each other from school, and since it was the 2nd grade of primary we were just enjoying our lives.

So when the day ended we went our seperate ways, but i didn't say goodbye. 2-3 days later our principal calls my whole class to tell us that marcel died. They never told us why, but after some research in the internet a couple if weeks ago i found that he was choked to death by his father in their car. The father left the veicle with his sons dead body in one of the parking spots of the swimming pool. He ran away for almost one day before he commited suizide in a small garden.

    "selftext": "We can sometimes have a vague sense of dissatisfaction with our lives, that things aren‚Äôt quite how they should be - we look over the fence to our neighbours either literally or metaphorically and see what we don‚Äôt have. We look at our lives and see the pressures we‚Äôre under and it feels unfair. If we won the lottery wouldn‚Äôt it all go away? Why couldn‚Äôt you get to be a footballer or a singer and earn big money?\n\nWhat if you had all the money you could spend and could live a life of consumption? Would you be happier? The evidence suggests that once our basic needs are met, extra income doesn‚Äôt increase our emotional happiness. In fact, a life focused on pleasure can have the opposite effect - with more and more food, alcohol, drugs or media required to give us our hit, we blow a fuse in our dopamine receptors and lose our ability to find happiness in anything.\n\nThe secret to sustainable happiness is finding beauty and joy in the everyday. When we have money problems this can definitely be more difficult but once we have more than we need the extra resources begin to obscure our vision, it distracts us from the world in front of us. Thich Nhat Hanh describes this as being lost in consumption.\n\nThe happiness we imagine we would get from consumption is already available to us by paying close attention to the details of our experience in the present moment. That can be a walk, eating our dinner, a conversation with a friend or simply breathing in and out. This is something that many people find hard to accept, which is understandable. We‚Äôre conditioned through the media we consume to believe that we need to consume more which leads us to make choices that are supposed to make us happy at some point in the future but in reality cause ourselves and others to suffer. Nothing is more important than your peace - that‚Äôs why its critical to stop as often as possible and ask yourself - will this choice really make me happy? Or will it lead to suffering? Mindfulness is the art of stopping and just stopping and asking that question every so often can do a great deal to put you on the path to happiness.\n\nAnd what do we do with our desire? We don‚Äôt have to beat ourselves up for wishing for money, we can simply notice the thought, acknowledge it, accept it and let it go. We‚Äôre not our thoughts, not every thought has to be clung onto and by letting go of each thought of desire as it arises, our gnawing hunger starts to lose its power over us. We can also look deeply into it, understanding where from our past experience it grows from. \n\n\n[Listen On Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/if-i-only-won-the-lottery/id1493806566?i=1000524325910)\n\n[Listen On Google Podcasts](https://www.google.com/podcasts?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9hbmNob3IuZm0vcy8xMjNkZThlMC9wb2RjYXN0L3Jzcw==)\n\n[Listen On Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/1ozwIEgzEtHQezPoi83nVV)\n\n[Other ways to listen](https://anchor.fm/shaun-donaghy/episodes/If-I-only-won-the-lottery-e124df9)",

This was before the Internet but I remember very clearly being extremely sexually minded as early as four or five. When I was around nine, I had a crush on a girl and I drew a doodle of her naked in my journal. I started thinking the other week about how I could have possibly known what female genitalia looks like because again, this was before the Internet. I don't know how I would have had access to that kind of information. This then reminded me that, when I was four or maybe five, I would wake up really early some mornings and masturbate. I don't know how I knew how to do it or why I knew it felt good‚Äîbut I knew that I had to keep it a secret and not get caught. Sometimes, I would tie my socks around my stuffed animals' chests and pretend I was taking off their bras. In remembering this, the sex I was imagining was oral, and I don't think it was until health class in fifth grade (age 9 or 10) that I learned what actual sex was. At this point, I was already masturbating regularly.\n\nNow, I can't stop ruminating on the fact that I would do this and it has me concerned. I've been depressed and anxious for my entire life. A therapist I saw recently diagnosed me with complex-PTSD. I don't see them anymore and I honestly don't know if I would ever tell a therapist this aloud. This is the first time I'm even admitting it to myself by writing it down. I never attributed anything significant to these events but now I am wondering if something might have happened to me that caused me to act in this sexual way so early in life. I can't stop ruminating and crying and asking myself if I had been sexually assaulted as a child.\n\nDo you think this was normal behavior for a child, or is it the result of sexual trauma? I have no memory of being sexually assaulted as a child, but given my ability to disassociate, it is possible. Is there any other explanation for this?",

This happens especially after I feel basically okay and calm for a day or so (I have severe depression and anxiety so some days I‚Äôm really feeling it). I used to look at people who looked better than me on Instagram to make myself feel bad, it look up people who treated me poorly in high school. I have now upgraded basically trying to antagonize my boyfriend‚Äôs ex. (They had a bad breakup and he started seeing me soon afterward.) I have only done this a couple times and the feelings are always the same. We share similar interests and have a few acquaintances, so we occupy a lot of the same spaces online. I know if I post something somewhere unrelated to her that it will most likely upset her and then she‚Äôll go on another social media outlet, mostly twitter, to badmouth me or him. Whenever she says particularly mean things about me, I feel justified in my belief that I‚Äôm horrible. Almost immediately after seeing her reaction I feel absolutely awful and sad and guilty that I made her feel angry or upset. Whenever I find myself bored or calm, I start envisioning ways I could share something that she would eventually see that would set her off. I hate doing this. My friends and boyfriend don‚Äôt understand why I do it. The closest thing I could find to describe the feelings and cycle was a graphic I saw on Instagram about emotional addiction. I crave the feeling of suspense waiting for someone to get mad and talk down about me and awaiting the chance to feel awful about myself. But after it‚Äôs over I feel guilt and shame and utter sadness that I am contributing to someone‚Äôs problems. I have stopped going into shared spaces to keep myself from doing this, but I need something to just make me stop altogether. Instead of baiting her specifically, I‚Äôve gone back to browsing Instagram to make myself feel bad about my body and sometimes I‚Äôll look at her Instagram to make myself feel awful about ruining her life. I feel terrible. Even now I am fighting the urge to post something just so she sees my name and goes off about me. I don‚Äôt want to hurt her and I feel guilty for contributing to her hurt. In general I don‚Äôt know why I have this behavior, and I feel like it‚Äôs hard to break. I really feel like I‚Äôm not a good person at all.",

    "title": "How To Cope After Getting Jumped",
    "selftext": "So about a year ago I went to a party with my girlfriend and one of my friends were there. Turned out someone there didn't like my friend and had a group of about five women with them. \nThe biggest girl out of the group (about twice my friends size) wanted to fight her, the reason I didn't know. All I knew, was that these women were not about to let them fight one on one, even though their friend had an obvious advantage. \nI have a little situational awareness, and before the fight I got in-between them and told my friend how obvious it was that she would lose the fight. She told me to tell them she didn't want to fight, so I did. The other girl insisted on it and went passed me and they started to fight. \n\nThe crowd of the party surrounds them, and as I'm trying to push passed and tell people to break it up, I get yanked by my hair for no reason by one of the bigger girls friends. Trying to stop a fight ended in me getting jumped alongside her, I'm a semi-buff, masculine female so I assume they saw me as a threat, even though it was clear I was attempting to break it up. \nI had no chance of throwing any punches, as there were two or three girls pulling me to the ground by my hair every second, not letting me stand. All I could do was try to pull them down to the ground with me by the legs and try covering my face. At one point towards the end I was on the ground pushed up against a wall with my hands in the air, saying things like \"what the f*ck, what's wrong with you?\" \n\nOddly enough, I left the jumping with no marks, bruises, or even a scratch. Just massively tangled hair. I got up after it was over, confidently chugged a beer, and laughed about it with some of my male friends to brush off the embarrassment. \n\nStill, to this day, I have trouble falling asleep because I'm angry at what I could've done, imagining scenarios where I defended myself better, wishing I never went to the party, or never tried to intervene or stop my friend from getting jumped as well. All these just end me being unable to sleep and being bitter/angry at the women who coupled me into the fight for no reason. \n\nI don't want any revenge, I just want to figure out a way to be at peace with what happened, how to sleep without feeling anger that keeps me awake, and I guess, how to forgive the women who jumped me to ease the anger. \n\nI find it appalling that someone can raise children and not tell them what a fair fight is, or how these women get to sleep at night feeling good about the fight they \"won\" against me, someone who has never lost a one on one fight and is known for that. \n\nI guess I'm just looking for advice on how to cope so I can get some sleep each night. It happens often where I can't sleep due to the anger and embarrassment of this situation. It's currently 1:30 AM as I'm writing this, and I need to work in the morning. \n\nAnyone who's been jumped, or anyone who has any advice, please enlighten me. I don't want to live my life feeling defeated by a group of trashy women.",

    "title": "My rapist is trying to make amends. What do I do?",
    "selftext": "My rapist is trying to make amends. What do I do?\n\nHello everyone. I hope you all are doing well. \n\nWhen I ( F19) was around the age of seven, my brother (M 24) started sexually abusing me. It started with a game he made up in order to touch my private parts and what not. Then escalated over the years. Memories are kind of blurry to be honest. But I know he fingered me, dry humped me, masturbated lying next to me, touched my body. This all I can remember clearly. I don't try to think more because I'm afraid the more I recall, the more it's going to hurt me. Conclusion being he raped me. \n\nThe last time he tried to rape me is when I was 16. Due to some reasons that gave me the courage, I managed to stood up for myself and threatened to go to police and tell everyone. I'd always hate myself for not standing up sooner. \n\nHe stopped and started crying. I remember how fast my heart was beating when he was touching me and I was planning to fight back and how scared I was feeling lying there. But when he was telling how he'd kill himself if I tell anyone and was crying and begging me to forgive him, I started consoling him. I started consoling that monster!!!\nI'd always hate myself for consoling that monster. \n\nIt was hard. For some reason I didn't stop talking to him completely. Over the years, my hate grew stronger and stronger for him. Maybe if he hadn't physically hit me after that and proved to be a good brother, the naive me would have even forgiven him for ruining my life, for giving me a lifetime of trauma... but he's my big brother no? He loves me right? Yeah I guess that's what I thought.\n\nAnyway denial can't work forever so last few months, thanks to reddit rape stories, flashbacks and nightmares, I'm forced to face my trauma. I don't blame myself for what happened anymore. I was just a little girl who didn't even know what the hell is happening with her. I know now how horrible it was what he did to me. I know now how much it have affected my childhood and how much it's affecting my adulthood. \n\nWhen something like this happens, I think it always have a great impact on you. I feel when you went through years of abuse at a young age, it just totally defines you in a way. My abuse made me a quiet, innocent and depressed girl. I mean what kind of person I could have been if he hadn't put me through that?\n\nIs it possible I'd have been more girly girl type? Or maybe an extrovert? Mischievous? Happy?\n\nI guess I'd never know.\n\nI'll always miss the girl I wasn't given a chance to be. \n\nNow ofcourse when you get this realisation that you were raped and guess what sweetie it wasn't your fault! You can't keep pretending that nothing happened. \n\nSo I've stopped talking with that monster altogether. \n\nI threatened him for the second time a few weeks back for some reason. I told him I know what he did to him and I hold the power to ruin his life. \n\nIn the first week of October, there was a festival in my country. A part of the ritual is that the brother is supposed to give something to the sister so I got some cash like always. My family doesn't know so I accepted it. After a few minutes, I returned the money in private. \n\nNow that was a huge thing. It was a clear indication that I'm not his sister anymore. It was loud and clear that he means nothing to me and that he's basically dead to me. \n\nHe tried to come in my room that night but thankfully it was locked and I got like 20-30 calls from him and couple of texts. \n\nI got texts from him again today. \n\nThese were his texts - ‚Äúplease don't stay mad at me‚Äù, ‚ÄúI love you a lot sister‚Äù, ‚Äú please reply something, I know you love me‚Äù.  \n\nI ignored his texts. He tried to come in my room but ofcourse it was locked. He tried to call but I ignored. \n\nNow my question is what the hell am I supposed to do?\n\nPlease don't tell me to tell my parents. I've really thought about it a lot and I cannot do that. Hopefully in a few years I'd manage to lock him in prison but that can't be done now. And I understand how important it is to report. I'd always be disappointed in myself for not being able to do that. \n\nI most definitely cannot forgive him ever. I understand for some people it helps but nopeeeeee! Never! Don't even comment that please. I respect your opinion but nope!  The amount of trauma I've to deal with on daily basis... nope!\n\nHe's asking me to talk to him at least once. Should I do that? I don't want him to convince me that he's a nice person because he's a fucking monster and that's all. I don't want it to end like it did last time as in me consoling him. I have made a lot of progress in the last few months and i can't let that go to waste. \n\nA part of me is scared he'd kill himself. To be completely honest, I don't even fucking care if does. If anything I'd be happy. But I would be sad how depressed my parents would be after his death and that I'd kinda be guilty cause I had just listened it wouldn't have happened. But I'm just overthinking I guess. Sadly he's not going anywhere. A part of me is also scared he'd kill me. I mean he raped me, I wouldn't be surprised if he kills me to save his ass.  I've actually made a note in my phone just in case lol. But I'm just overthinking here right?\n\nWith all the things I've been doing lately like no communication, threats, cutting bonds...he might be afraid I'll tell my parents or police and wants to make sure I don't do that. \n\nI don't want to give him that assurance even if that means he'd stop calling and texting me. I'm suffering here. He doesn't deserve to have peace of mind. If he's scared than he better be hella scared. \n\nSooo kind redditors, tell me what to do? Should I just keep on ignoring him? Or do I give him a chance to talk to me once at the risk of being manipulated by him i guess?",

    "title": "Friend keeps reaching out after I asked for space for self-care.",
    "selftext": "Earlier this year, I sent a message to family and friends that I was going to focus on myself this year and would not be available via phone or in-person. The second half of last year, I was extremely burnout and was compassion/empathy fatigued on top of chronic health issues. Most days were harder than most. Due to over a dozen autoimmune disorders and ailments the last 5 years and my spending 3 decades of putting others‚Äô needs before my own, I needed time to rest, prioritize myself and to fill my own cup.\n\nIn order to not make it seem like I had fallen off the surface of the earth, my therapist suggested that it was important that I communicated this ask for space to friends and family so that it left little room for people to fill in the blanks, worry about me, or assume (selfish, ghosting, not caring, etc). And suggested that if I need more time for myself, to gently let them know that I appreciate them but am still focused on taking care of myself. Most people have respected or seem to honor that ask for space. \n\nI have a friend (both of us are early 30s bipoc fire-sign women with CPTSD and have known each other for over 15 years) that has called and texted me several times this year. I have not answered any of them. The first few times they reached out this year, I just believed that if they couldn‚Äôt get ahold of me, they would go back and reread the last message they received from me and be like ‚Äúoh right, that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre doing - taking intentional time for self-care.‚Äù But now with a quarter of the year in, I‚Äôm not sure if my friend comprehends or respects boundaries. \n\nI don‚Äôt use or have social media (except for Reddit for limited reasons). I‚Äôm not attached to my phone so I don‚Äôt carry it around with me often when I‚Äôm at home.\n\nThe only other person who tries to contact me is my sister (25F). She would sometimes send memes but that takes little effort or mental/emotional capacity to engage with. Sometimes I‚Äôll thumbs up the post but most of the time, not respond right away or respond at all. My sister and I have our fair share of not viewing the world in the same way and growing pains but for the most part she advocates for me, especially to our narcissistic mom that I am not being selfish but am taking care of myself. \n\nLast fall, I asked for a month of personal space so I can focus on back to back doctors‚Äô appointments and finishing many work projects. I often let people know when I have an extensive period of time that I‚Äôm just going to doctors‚Äô appointments. She was still texting me with home remedies and holistic health stuff - none of which was useful to me. I would respond sporadically when I could. But the moment the month was up, she was FaceTiming and texting me. I then asked for some more space because I was burnout and exhausted on top of recovering from stomach flu, and mentally grasping all the new health diagnoses I had. During that second month she was still texting me but I did not engage. When that month was up, she called me and said ‚ÄúYour girl did good right? I gave you space. I can‚Äôt wait to give you love.‚Äù \n\nI‚Äôve brought up many of these issues with her in 2021. But she always insists that it‚Äôs her ‚Äúgiving me love‚Äù and I‚Äôve straight up told her that it is overwhelming and I am not in a place to receive it because it‚Äôs not the type of love and attention that I need. I have spent many years healing and have a strong sense of self-validation so I don‚Äôt seek much of it outside of myself. I have mentioned several times that I don‚Äôt appreciate unsolicited advice regarding my health conditions - that‚Äôs what doctors and specialists are for. I have told her that because I am chronically ill, I get exhausted when I talk to her because her phone calls are often spontaneous, unplanned because phone calls with her lasts no less than 2 hours. I‚Äôve told her that I can do quick phone calls only and if she wants to talk longer, we can schedule it so it can be on a day I know I can reserve my energy for. She continued to call me and text me regardless of me relying this. I would often not respond or call back until days later when I had the mental capacity or the time to.\n\nI realized that my friend doesn‚Äôt have a strong sense of boundaries because she has often had her‚Äôs violated. And because of this, she can‚Äôt possibly see mine or the lines I draw with toxic friends and family members. She keeps around individuals who have harmed her or allowed her to be in harms way, neglected and abandoned her, and she often goes out of her way for them to then be frustrated when they do not reciprocate it back even when there was no sign of it being transactional. She‚Äôll say stuff like ‚ÄúThey might not love me like I love them but that‚Äôs still my mom/sister/aunt/etc you know.‚Äù To which I usually say ‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù\n\nI think I haven‚Äôt been able to see the lack of respect for my boundaries from her because I was so focused on them being in place because of my toxic family that I didn‚Äôt think that a friend who talks about their own healing journey and is sending me all these holistic techniques is actually dismissive of my boundaries. And I also realized that my minimal effort may be interpreted as maximum effort for someone like her because she receives very little or no effort from the people in her life.\n\nI‚Äôve been putting a lot of thought into how to best respond to my friend in a kind and compassionate way that doesn‚Äôt set off or trigger their own trauma but still stand firm in how I feel about focusing on myself. I truly empathize with them but I also know that I shouldn‚Äôt compromise my own health and mental well-being in doing so. I want to take accountability and see where perhaps I may be unaware of how I‚Äôm contributing to this relationship. I know it‚Äôs a long read, but other views on how to move forward and communicate would be much appreciated!",

I realized that i don‚Äôt form friendships spontaneously and have a hard time connecting with people. When i was married, 10y, my life was work, family, and occasional contact with a small circle of lifelong friends I‚Äôve had for decades. \n\n3 years ago, that ended and my life was work, kids, hang out w friends 2/month. The rest of the time, i was dissociating with the aid of substances. This last year, i cleaned up, got some meds, lost 55 lbs, spent a lot of time with a lady friend. \n\nNow, i realize the amount of reliance i have on the one friend and have been sober and unpacking trauma enough to realize how much i have not formed connections with people over my whole life. I don‚Äôt form new friendships spontaneously at all. Zero in 25 years. Only under certain circumstances like shared trauma, and not developing to frequent contact. \n\nI have had minor ED my whole life but since my marriage ended it‚Äôs getting worse and worse. I realize i have frequent anxiety, and my avoidant and anxious attachment has led to only a few romantic relationships of any duration (more than a few months) and mostly with avoidant ladies. I have never felt the drive or comfort to pick up casual sexual relationships and wish that were possible for me. I feel tremendous sorrow for my solitude and history of dissociation. \n\nI have a therapist monthly, a sex therapist weekly, SSRI, diagnosed ADHD, undiagnosed ASD. I am lonely, overwhelmed with grieving for my lost opportunities in life, and want to live a full life. I don‚Äôt know how to begin. Im starting to try to chat w strangers to practice.

    "title": "I can't overcome my trauma. TW: mental, sexual and physical abuse, self-harm, suicide.",
    "selftext": "[Very long]\n\nI hold a lot of trauma. A lot of bad crap has happened in my life and lately, I just have not been dealing.\n\nMy mother is the main cause for most of my trauma, I've had a lot of childhood abuse, followed by extremely traumatic (for me) events that I just can't seem to leave behind.\n\nGrowing up I was very jealous of my younger step-sister as I felt she was the \"favorite\". My mother would do and say a lot of things that at the time, I didn't realize we're manipulative and nasty. \nShe would purposefully leave me out of family events such as road trips, family photos etc and frequently leave me behind at home alone as a minor, >10 years.\nShe would coat candy in cayenne pepper and wrap them back up and leave them in my room for me.\nThere's a lot to the childhood side, and I suspect there is more that my brain has blocked away. I do remember that if I 'misbehaved' (made too much noise, didn't do enough chores etc) she would make me run laps of our driveway, or she would assault me. If I injured myself, she told me to get over it. One time she made me run laps and I fell, sprained my ankle pretty bad and couldnt walk on it, she told me just to quit acting and walk normally. To stop being a  \"hollywood\".\nNeedless to say, this meant our relationship was pretty strained. My dad's side (different to my step-sisters) of my family was regularly concerned but couldn't do much as mum had full custody.\nAs I got into my teens, things started to get worse again. The mental abuse and manipulation became a daily thing, until I put up \"mental walls\" as I've always referred to them, I wouldn't let people close to me because I was afraid that this treatment is what that would mean.\nI became extremely lonely and depressed. I would self-harm, not for attention, but because I felt I deserved it. I felt that I had been an awful daughter somehow and so this would make it better. It was just a little bit at first, but then it got worse, and worse. I would wrap my arm up in scarfs like bandages. I was in so much pain in every sense of the word, just thinking back to that time right now gives me an uncomfortable feeling in my chest. I used things to self-harm that my mother really should've noticed, as they were from her personal effects. I was extremely depressed and thanks to some of the manipulation from my mother, I was convinced I was just a waste of space. That I would be less of a burden to them if I just ended it. \nThat's when they started. The suicidal thoughts. Again, I won't go into detail, but I got to the point I had started planning things out. I felt separated from anyone who gave a damn, I was struggling severely as I was constantly being made to feel terrible at home. I got to the point where I was so stressed and depressed it made me physically ill. \nOne day, I sent out the messages. This is it, I can't keep going. I'm not strong enough. I made the attempt, and it failed. My body refused to cooperate. A close friend who I consider to be like a sister to me, reached out to my counselor in school, who got in touch with myself and my mother. My mother was made aware of the issue, and acted concerned. We got home, and she reprimanded me. She was angry I \"got caught\". \nI don't remember a lot from between this time, I know there were more attempts, I know there was more self-harm. But it's foggy. The next \"thing\" I remember, is my boyfriend. My mother hated him, like genuine pure hatred. I must've been about 15, (not legal age) when he first, did things. He made me think it was okay. I was aware of consent, but looking back on it, I did not give consent. Not once. I remember crying, a lot. My depression got worse, but I kinda just thought this was all normal. \nMy mother refused to speak to me. Not a single word. Not even when I asked about things, our relationship was non existent. It was like I was a ghost. So there I am. 15, and terrified. 15, with no one to talk to. I didn't have any way to contact my family any more, I was completely alone. A stranger in someone's house. I was hurting, and desperately screaming out for help, but I was alone.\nI tried to focus on school. I tried getting jobs outside of school so I could try and make something of my life, no luck. I was good at school. I have adhd, so sometimes I struggled but my grades were consistently good, especially in music. Music was my safe haven. I could lose myself composing and it was like nothing was wrong. I, kinda felt like myself. But only when I ingulfed myself in music.\nI was 16 when my life changed. My dad had moved south to help me and try get me safe. It was the day he got the place confirmed, I was packing things, getting ready to leave. I was finally gonna be okay. My dad, who was my superhero, was here to save me. My mother wasn't happy. She liked being in control, but she still wasn't talking to me.\nFor a while, she had been making my room thrown about and a mess, taking photos and posting them to Facebook while I wasn't home. Blaming me, calling me a pig and disgusting,  a lot of things.\nIt's the morning. I have a phone by now, thanks to my dad and im sat on the phone in my room talking to my grandma about how excited I am. Footsteps. Coming up to my room. Then a thud, and a rustle. My mother had a bag of crap that she had broken and put into a bag to throw around my room. I tell grandma I have to go, tell her mums being a b***h and I need to sort this.i pull my camera app up and click record. \nI start screaming at her. Calling her out to post to my own Facebook and finally clear my name. Big mistake. She goes me. The bag gets dropped and she assaults me, badly. I do everything in my power to keep my phone away from her filming the proof. She pins me on my bed, I'm struggling, and the books from under my bed (holding it up) give way. I fall and try get under what I can of the frame for protection. Mistake #2. She chases me from above the bed, and pins it down on me, the sharp part from the broken leg is digging into my stomach, the frame is bearing down on my chest. I can't breathe. I've been screaming for what feels like hours. I know my neighbour's are home. My windows open, their windows are open, and I am SCREAMING at the top of my lungs, but nothing. I can hear my little sister crying downstairs and I try screaming for her, or my step-dad, nothing. I'm alone... with my mother, who seems to be trying to kill me. I'm struggling and trying to punch at her to get her off but I can't breathe. I manage to get out, in a lot of pain. And after more struggling, I manage to pin her while I try to lock my phone to end and protect the video. She bites me. In the arm. Where I've been cutting. I manage to lock the phone and I yet it downstairs, screaming to my family not to let her get it. I'm exhausted. I can't fight anymore. I feel so weak, my throat is hoarse, my face is damp, im in so much God damned pain. I feel destroyed. She's won. She's gotten away with it again. I go to the other side of the room as she gets to my phone to a blanket I had on the ground, I curl up, and I cry. There's nothing I can do. I should have ended my life months ago. Instead I chose to endure years of this hell. And now, my one chance, is destroyed. I don't know how much time goes by, but I am shaking in a corner still crying when I hear a door slam open. I don't remember it well, I was extremely traumatized. My brain was foggy. But my dad had arrived. My superhero. He was here to save me. \nMy mother had taken the SD card out of my phone but I didn't care. I just wanted to be gone. My dad got me out of there. Trying to comfort me, taking me to our new home (next door to my boyfriends house). I go into my phone and realise two things. A) my mum doesn't know my password. B) the video didn't save to my SD card. It saved to my phone. My dad took me to the cops, I gave them the video and a statement/report of some kind. They offer some services to help I.e. counseling, but I decline. I don't push charges. All I can think of is my little sister. I can't let this happen to her, but she's 11, I can't take her mother away from her. I just can't. \nNot long after this, my boyfriend breaks up with me telling me that I've changed. I find out from his younger brother who I'm close with that he cheated on me. He had my best friend (who I met him through) in his bedroom the night before he broke up with me. Everyone blames me. He suggests we still have interactions. He talks me into it, while I'm still sensitive and raw from everything that's happened. He uses me. A lot.\nI get so depressed, that I once again make myself sick. I'm off school around 5-6 weeks. I can barely make it out of bed. My dad and my cat are the only things I have to live for. I can't deal.\nMore stuff happens, foggy brain.\nI'm working. My dad and I now live in my hometown with the rest of his family and its better. I'm recovering, I'm 17, its December, a year and two months since the assault and I'm recovering. I finally get a day off work with dad and we go out jetskiing. Just me and him. I've needed this, time with my dad, we've been so busy with work, this is the first time we've been able to do something since the assault really. \nI come in on the jet ski, and he asks if I want to go out again before we go home. I'm tired, I tell him I'm good. He tells me he'll go out one more time then we can go home. 10 minutes passes. Half an hour. He must be having fun. 45 minutes and I'm seeing people come in off the water and starting to worry. He should be back... an hour. I see a rescue helicopter, ive seen emergency vehicles of all sorts. He must be helping them, my dad's good like that, he's a hero. A little longer and a cop comes to my side of the water, im anxious  so I get out of the car and ask what's going on. There's been an accident. I ask if he's seen dad, describe him and the jet ski and he radios to ask. Next thing I know, I'm in the car, headed to the hospital. I've just gotten off the phone to my family to inform them dad's being helicoptered over. We're almost there. The policeman radio goes off. Something about a status 0. This man, this wonderfully caring, respectful man, has to tell me my dad has passed away. And I won't get to say goodbye.\nI get to the hospital to my family and I lost it. \nI entirely blame myself. \"If I said I want to go home now...\" \"if I went out longer or again\" etc. I'm destroyed. I'm shattered. Again. And now, my superheros gone. I feel so alone. I can't do this.\nFast forward to the next year, ive just gotten home, it's October. Pops sick. My grandfather. He's in hospital. An enlarged Aorta. They were supposed to do surgery, but it was a long weekend. Then Monday comes around, it's too late. They can't do the surgery, it's too dangerous for him. He passes away two weeks after my dad did, a year later. I hate Christmas. Truly hate it.\nThere's a lot of in-between, truly awful things, but these are the things that most bother me. I'm terrified of the ocean. I can't go near it without losing my shit. I've been having flashbacks to my assault frequently. I'm angry. For a lot of reasons. I've been having a lot of flashbacks, that are so raw and so real, it's like I am back in those times, and it's terrifying. I don't know how to cope. I've tried therapy, its too expensive now and I'm afraid. The suicidal thoughts have come back with the flashbacks and I can't deal anymore. What can I do.",

I can‚Äôt hear people talking about it. And I can definitely not watch it. It goes for all kinds of torture, but it‚Äôs this one type, this specific way of doing it, that is the worst.\n\nI just ran out of the living room because me and some friends were watching a movie and there was an image of a man who had this specific ‚Äútool‚Äù in his belt. That‚Äôs all it takes for me to panic. Nothing even happened. And I feel so ashamed of myself. I‚Äôm a grown-up, and I‚Äôm like a scared, little child.\n\nThis ‚Äútrauma‚Äù (or what else it is) is a huge problem. I‚Äôm getting anxious every time I‚Äôm gonna see a movie with other people, or every time I go to the cinema. If somebody I‚Äôm talking to mentions it, I‚Äôm pretending to lean my head in my hands, but what I‚Äôm actually doing is covering my ears; or I hastily find an excuse to leave.

And, I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs flashbacks, but sometimes there‚Äôs thoughts about it popping up in my head, and I feel panicky and sick.\n\nI‚Äôm not even sure if I wanna get better, cause I don‚Äôt want to ever see/hear those things.

Just seeing an image of a ‚Äútool‚Äù, or hearing one word about it, is causing me to have an extreme reaction. I‚Äôm very ashamed of myself. The thing is, nothing ever happened to me. I was never abused. I had a normal, good childhood. Yet, I‚Äôve had this trigger my entire life. How is this possible?? Why am I like this??",

    "selftext": "There‚Äôs an old Zen joke: a guy is riding a horse down a road at breakneck speed, barely holding on. A person standing by the side of the road watching him scream past shouts to him, \"where are you going?\" He says, \"I don‚Äôt know, ask the horse.\" Like most Zen jokes its more of a thinker than laugh out loud funny; the insight here is that we are both the rider and the horse - the rider is our conscious choices, the horse is our habits. \n\nTo let go of our harmful habits we need to train our awareness - stopping for a few minutes each day, focusing on our breath, our bodies, our thoughts, our feelings. But just as important is training ourselves to recognize the habit when it arises. Its key not to see that habit as the enemy - when we fight ourselves we tend to lose a lot of the time. Just notice it, be aware of it and breath for a few moments, allowing it to pass.\n\nIf we care for our habit energy like a friend, listening to what it‚Äôs telling us, not treating ourselves like a battlefield or running but shining the light of awareness and allowing that awareness to transform our habits, we can start to water the seeds of joy in our life. And with enough awareness and enough time, the horse will slow down, stop and maybe even let you take the reigns.\n\n[Listen On Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/new-year-new-habits-happy-life/id1493806566?i=1000504003474)\n\n[Listen On Google Podcasts](https://www.google.com/podcasts?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9hbmNob3IuZm0vcy8xMjNkZThlMC9wb2RjYXN0L3Jzcw==)\n\n[Listen On Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/1ozwIEgzEtHQezPoi83nVV)\n\n[Other ways to listen](https://anchor.fm/shaun-donaghy/episodes/New-year--new-habits--happy-life-eodqsl)",

    "title": "Can therapy help a teenager that goes into a panic state in the classroom",
    "selftext": "My teenage daughter goes into a panic state in the classroom. It happens in situations where everyone is quiet, like during tests and presentations. When she is allowed to take the tests in a separate room she is able to control herself and often achieves very good results (she was a stellar student before the problem started). Her previous school is probably at the root of the problem but the truth is that it has not yet been possible to explore this hypothesis. Indeed, despite the fact that she has problems only in the classroom, therapists are always very resistant to considering the possibility. They prefer to blame her or her parents.\n\nShe was with several therapists over three years but things never work and she eventually refuses to continue. The therapists never see the full extent of the problem and they confuse my involvement with her as the cause of the problem rather than as a way to lower her anxiety (I'm her safe person). When things start to go wrong they eventually change their minds and began pressuring me to make her go but by then the trust with her is already broken. In one case the therapist panicked and wanted to put her on a lot of medication.\n\nWe are all extremely tired of this process. School pressures us to provide external psychology counselling to her but it isn't working and she is always the first to notice it. Therapists have a lot of preconceived ideas and I'm starting to think they are basically a fraud. Instead of helping, they end up becoming one more problem in our lives.\n\nMeanwhile, I have been trying to learn about the subject and at the moment I think the problem could be that therapists, in general, know very little about trauma.\n\nFor those of you who have tried different types of therapy, do you think we should give it a last try with a trauma trained therapist? What is the difference? Or will it be better to try more \"alternative\" routes like yoga, massage, etc.?\n\nThank you in advance.\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEDIT - Thank you very much for the comments and ideas.\n\nMy daughter was in a homeschooling regimen for a year but, at that age, she missed the social aspect of school very much. Now she is in an art school, where teachers are more tolerant. But of course there are still tests.\n\nI don't know what 504 is (I'm in Europe) but I imagine it is a special education regime that allows teachers to accommodate adaptations in terms of teaching methods (and contents, although this does not apply in our case). I'm trying to put my daughter on this regime. However, if she doesn't get better she won't be able to go to university afterwards, which is limiting and can be a pity because she is intelligent and she likes theoretical subjects like physics a lot.\n\nWe don't want to put her on medication. I have learned the hard way that this is a very dangerous path, and more so for a teenager. I am still coming out of an almost two-year slow taper of an antidepressant and I do not wish anyone the symptoms, least of all to my daughter. A thousand times the original depression than the withdrawal symptoms. Before the anti-depressant, I had to taper a benzodiazepine, as doctors like these drug cocktails. It took me a year to get to the end, and the symptoms included weeks of horrible pain all over my body. I am very angry with what doctors did to me. Getting me on these drugs without warning of all the problems they cause in the long run. I took them because of work issues and now I'm unable to work because of the withdrawals.\n\nFor children and adolescents, the recommended treatment of anxiety are antidepressants. In addition, as according to recent results these drugs can make their anxiety worse, especially in the beginning, with several reported cases of teenagers who committed suicide, they now want to supplement antidepressants with ... antipsychotics! Antipsychotics affect creativity, appetite and a host of other things. I think this is a very dangerous route, especially for a brain that is still under development.",

I am 28 years old now and up until that point I had seen several therapists that I feel didn't really work. because of the method of therapy.\n\nLong story short- I have completed a solid 3 years of therapy in the modalities of plant medicine journeys, generational trauma release, EMDR, Lens, ketamine assisted therapy, nervous system therapy, breathwork, meditation, tantra and now I am onto micro-dosing iboga.\n\nFor the last several months I have been micro-dosing iboga and it has been a really amazing, heart opening and trauma dissolving experience. I feel that this plant has given me so much creativity, happiness and love. I never knew that once you fix all the triggers/trauma, what the other side feels like as I have never been on this side. I am waking up every single day consistently happy, not as triggered and soooooo much calmer. \n\nI just wanted to share this as it takes time to get your mental health in a good place. It takes a lot of work, years and a lot of support. Please don't get discouraged and know that you are not alone in this fight. Experiment with different modalities of healing, just because talk therapy worked for someone, doesn't mean it's the best for you or your situation. \n\nAlso remember that sometimes when you feel a certain feeling doesn't necessarily mean it's YOURS. If our parents and their parents didn't clear up their trauma, unfortunately the gets passed down to us and stores in our body. So if we don't resolve that, we keep passing it down and continuing the cycle. \n\nI hope this sheds some light in sometimes a very very dark place. Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions or to share your story. There is a lot of power in community!\n\nMuch Love",

    "title": "How do I even start to heal?",
    "selftext": "Tw: in depth discussion of gun violence\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHi, I'm a freshman currently at Michigan State University, and two weeks ago, a gunman came onto campus and shot up two different buildings, killing three people and hospitalizing five.  I was about two buildings away from the shooting when it started, meaning that I heard the shots, screams, and sirens.  For four hours I hid in my closet, crying on the phone with my parents and sister.  I was never in any real danger past the first moments (I was close enough for stray bullets to theoretically be a concern), but the police scanners we were all listening to made it seem like there were multiple shooters in all parts of campus.  We thought it was a mass terrorism event, and I had to come to terms with the fact that the police were saying that there was a shooter on the same floor of the same building as some of my friends.  I didn't know if I was ever going to see them again or even get to come home.\n\nTwo weeks on, I can't think.  I feel like a fog has settled over my brain.  I have a hard time typing out sentences, let alone doing advanced math or writing a paper.  Any assignment feels overwhelming, but I can't take a break from school because I will lose my scholarship.  I'm in therapy, but there's only so much you can do on a zoom call that's not technically even supposed to be happening because you're out of state.  I shake uncontrollably at random times and can't watch a lot of the shows that I like because they have gun violence and sirens in them.  I can't stop thinking about the what ifs and whys (why wasn't it me, it could have been me). I have to bike past the places where people died every day.  I just want everything to stop, but everything has to keep going because other people have lives too.\n\nI guess my question is how do I even start to heal?  I've looked into trauma therapy, but there's so much discourse on whether or not things like EMDR even work that I can't sift through it all.  Our psych services are overloaded with traumatized kids, so that's a no-go.  My profs are super nice and are giving grace on assignments, but if this lasts for more than two weeks more (after spring break), I'm not sure if that will be the case anymore.  I can't take a semester off because I'm only here on scholarship and that goes away if I drop.  I can't just stop my classes because I need grad school.  I can't go home early because I have a lab job that people need me to do, and if I somehow can swing it, then I'm just miserable in another state.  I feel like my life has been ripped away from me.  My parents keep telling me that I've gotta move on, and while I know they're right, it feels like telling someone they have to finish a marathon while that person is stuck in quicksand.  I'm mentally exhausted and everyone knows it.  How do I even start to put my life back together again?",

    "selftext": "I got raped almost 10 years ago, and I'm still unable to function sexually.\n\nca. 10 years ago today I(F25) was raped by a guy I knew at a party. I don't really feel affected by this mentally (no flashbacks, nightmares etc) , but physically I definitely am. After this happened, I developed vaginismus, and which again made sex really painful. This has actually lead to me being raped 2 more times, because I join the intercourse, there's excruciating pain, and I am therefore forced to continue despite crying and trying to stop. This has lead to me developing a really unhealthy coping mechanism; If a guy flirts with me, and I am alone, with no one I know near me, I do whatever they want me to do in fear of being forced. This is to get a sense of control over the situation. If I really feel threathened, let's say I am completely alone with a guy and I feel cornered, I might even initiate sex, just to get the \"upper hand\". The problem is that the sex still is extremely painful, and I either completely dissociate or act as I love it to make it end as fast as possible (e.g. moaning out of pain --> sounds like I enjoy it). I can never be the one doing the work however, because I am mostly paralyzed, and my body is like jelly, but with the years I've partly been able to move somewhat, but that is only to help my act being as sexy as possible, which usually leads to the guy comming earlier which leads to sex ending earlier. \n\nMy problem right now is just that I am terrified of sex. I was in a relationship, and nothing changed. Everytime we tried to have sex, I freaked out and had a panick attack, and he was always really respectful and sweet about it, but it didn't matter. I am so lost. If someone just shows me their penis, I might dissociate. Holding it in my hand also leads to dissociating, and me being completely paralyzed. I am really lost, and I don't know what to do to get out of this situation. This has even made me suicidal, as I feel I'll just have to die alone (fyi also have BPD also contributing lol) and never be able to be in a relationship (I know people have relationships without sex, but I want to be able to have sex). I also feel like it's hard to even meet someone with an issue like this, as you usually have sex before you really know each other that well, and it would therefore be kind of wierd to even mention it (in the country I'm from, sex is really no big deal and sex on the first date is common).\n\nHas anyone been able to overcome these issues after rape, and how? I am really greatful for all input. \n\n(and yes I am in therapy and have been for years, and also on medications)",

When we listen deeply we‚Äôre not waiting for our opportunity to speak, we‚Äôre not lining up our point to win the argument, we‚Äôre focusing all of our attention on what the other person is saying.\n\n**Kindness** in our actions and communications. Key to this is choosing not to speak when we‚Äôre angry. When we feel anger we can walk away from the discussion and take some time to tend to it before re-engaging. We can do this by first accepting that we‚Äôre angry, listening to what our anger is saying without agreeing and looking deeply into why, outside of the current circumstances, we‚Äôre having this reaction. Is there a previous experience that means that we react with anger in this situation. When we‚Äôre ready to speak, we choose our words carefully, discussing issues in a way that doesn‚Äôt judge, blame or antagonise the other person.\n\n**Compassion** - bearing in mind that that person you‚Äôre speaking to is suffering and has a different set of circumstances than you. Understanding that their life experiences mean that they don‚Äôt react to situations in the same way. Have you ever had an experience where you couldn‚Äôt understand why some one was reacting so strongly until you found out a bit more about their lives and their actions become understandable, reasonable even? People develop survival strategies for the circumstances that they grow up in and its important to remember that other people‚Äôs survival strategies will be different to yours.\n\n**Non-attachment** - making sure that our happiness does not depend on another person. Healthy relationships are built on love rather than dependence, when our joy is conditional on another person then that's a huge burden to place on someone. We can love and appreciate a person in the here and now without needing them, which tends to drive them away in the long term.\n\n**Trust and honesty** - being comfortable enough with someone to kindly express how you‚Äôre really feeling without worrying about repercussions or consequences. In a healthy relationship you should be able to say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not feeling happy about this.‚Äù\n\n**Appreciation and gratitude** - its easy to take someone for granted, especially if it‚Äôs someone that you live with and see every day. Becoming more aware of the little things our loved ones do like washing the dishes or taking the bins out makes a big difference and you don‚Äôt have to buy them a Ferrari to demonstrate that you care - just noticing and communicating gratitude can be enough.\n\n[Listen On Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/six-essentials-for-healthy-relationships/id1493806566?i=1000520813508)\n\n[Listen On Google Podcasts](https://www.google.com/podcasts?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9hbmNob3IuZm0vcy8xMjNkZThlMC9wb2RjYXN0L3Jzcw==)\n\n[Listen On Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/1ozwIEgzEtHQezPoi83nVV)\n\n[Other ways to listen](https://anchor.fm/shaun-donaghy/episodes/Six-essentials-for-healthy-relationships-e10gcbl)",

    "title": "Healing Trauma Part 2 \"Turning Inward\"",
    "selftext": "This is the second of many posts on a series I'm calling \"Healing Trauma, the basics\".  Some of these posts will give specific advice for things to do in your daily life and others will simply introduce healing mindsets.\n\n#2 Turn your attention inward\n\nThis is the second post of the series because I see it as being another vital step to healing from trauma.  First of all, from my perspective, everyone is traumatized - narcissistic and/ or abusive parents / relationships, childhood abuse, cruel words and actions from peers growing up, and even any, yes literally any, unresolved emotions.  There are degrees to trauma but the point here is that everyone gets traumatized. So, in case you haven't read it yet, let's start here with my definition of what trauma is. \n\nI say that when a human being experiences a circumstance that overwhelms their mind-body system based on the current mental, emotional and physical status at that moment, their system kicks in the emergency response switch (trauma response) in order to save the entire system.  The traumatic moment is logged as a memory in the system (not just mentally but emotionally and physiologically as well) so that if similar circumstances arise again, it can be prepared to defend itself at all costs (think trigger here).  So the main takeaway here is that all trauma results in a loss of personal power.  As part of the journey for a human being from traumatized to healed, that power needs to be taken back.  So who will take this power back?  If you've recognized the validity in taking radical responsibility (which I outlined in my first post in the series, if you haven't read it, consider doing so) then it's time to take the next step and go inward.\n\nNow going inward does NOT mean we don't take action.  It does NOT mean we don't ensure our safety if we are being abused and/or manipulated.  Going inward is not a specific action, it is a lifestyle.  It is a call to greater levels of loving, conscious awareness for how trauma has affected us. Our entire mind-body system experienced trauma and that trauma is still in the system, down to the very cells that make up the body.  That system is constantly communicating to us but so very few of us were taught HOW to listen and HOW to interpret the signals being sent.  This is an introduction and invitation back to our own selves.\n\nTrauma causes us to feel like victims.  And when we are feeling like a victim we ask the question \"Why is this happening to ME?\"  Notice that this is NOT a productive question. I want us here to make a gigantic, cataclysmic shift in how we look at life. I want us to begin asking this question instead, \"What is this telling me about myself?\" So, the first thing to notice is how often our attention goes outward.  Trauma causes so many of us to either be afraid to really feel our feelings or experience our thoughts in a very conscious way or simply to be unable to feel them.  Feeling into our emotions and experiencing our thoughts is actually a lifelong process that can go deeper and deeper in a beautiful spiral of profoundness.  I won't go deeply into it here but this, for many of us, can take lots of practice. \n\nThe point in all of this is that each emotion, each thought is a signal.  It's a signal telling you something.  It's telling you something about...YOU.  Notice that the question, \"What is this telling me about myself?\" is not a judgement against anyone or anything.  It is an inquiry meant to take us deeper...deeper into understanding who and what we are.  We will not heal trauma by fixing the past.  The past is dead. done. cannot be changed or altered in any way.  What we are now though...our thought patterns, our emotional responses, our behaviors, our triggers...these are alive. these are present. these are real. these are US, all of us.  Begin to look and see what you are.  Maybe you were taught not to feel safe.  Tell yourself it's safe to feel how you feel.  Tell yourself this over and over and over until you start to see that no matter WHAT is going on around, you are always safe to feel however you feel.  How do I know this is always true?  Because that's how you feel and no matter how many times you tell yourself it's NOT safe to feel how you feel, it doesn't change how you feel.  See the irony in that?  See whether you can convince yourself of it too and once you really feel that safety, go deeper and see what you find.  Is your anxiety the child in you crying out for safety? Is your anger really just a call to love and accept yourself?  I don't know what the answer will be for you but the point, it's our job to go find out.  It's a beautiful journey and if you haven't started yet, I'm encouraging you to go, if you're ready to take the call.\n\nStay tuned for part 3 \"Understanding dysregulation in the brain\"\n\n\nFor anyone interested, my posts can also be found on my website - divinehumanity.org   I regularly post videos on youtube and also offer private sessions.

    "title": "How to help a survivor help themselves? Long story [cw child abuse/sexual abuse]",
    "selftext": "To make a long story short, the woman I dated while I was figuring out I was trans was sexually abused by her father as a child and raped while we were in a long distance relationship. She opened up to me about this while we were together but had told almost no one else. I realized I wasn't a man but wasn't ready to tell anyone and dumped her. About 9 months later she finally tells her mom what her dad did to her, but she tells her while screaming and breaking stuff in the house. Her mom didn't believe her and still doesn't. She calls me and I drive down to pick her up and she moved into my living room.\n\nWhen she first got here she was basically having a manic episode, could not stop talking and barely slept. I told her she was in crisis and needed to talk to a therapist. Because I pressured her to make an appointment the next day she spoke to a different therapist the her usual one, and actually could not stop screaming for 30-40 minutes. The therapist called a psychologist who said I should call 911 or take her to the ER. I got her to go to the ER after a while, once she got to the nurses she could not stop yelling again and was admitted into a mental health facility for about 3 days. She got out and has been staying in my living room for maybe 2.5 months.\n\nThroughout this period she regularly has sobbing breakdowns and needs me to hold her so she can sleep. She sometimes flies into manic rages and does things verging on self harm like breaking glass and kneeling on it (she was wearing pants.so she only cut herself a little). She has no job  or car and gets money for gig work. She speaks to her therapist every three weeks.\n\nI told her from day one that I was happy to support her but that I couldn't be the only one who was there for her and she needed to use the time she was functional to try to get a support network. She has done nothing to do that. I suggested that she take a community college course and offered to pay for it, she made an elaborate plan and worked out what she needed to do to get her bachelor's but backed out of taking even a single course cause she felt too worthless. \n\nI cannot bear to make this person homeless, but I am terrified at the prospect that I will be stuck with her forever because she is taking no actions to improve her mental health, reach out to a broader support network, or become financially independent. I have suggested she try going to support groups but bringing this up makes her feel like I'm not giving her credit for just keeping herself alive, she also insists no support group could ever help her. \n\nThis week I kind of snapped and gave her an ultimatum that she needed to spend two hours a week trying some new form of therapy or leave. Multiple screaming fights and sobbing breakdowns later she has sort of agreed. She is demanding I suggest the form of therapy which I feel is a trap because she hates other people telling her what to do, but when I tell her she should figure it out she tells me she's tried all possible treatments and none of them will work. \n\nI guess I'm here to ask you all advice on how to proceed. Am I wrong to insist she try something new or is not self harming all I can expect from her? How do you get someone out of the mode of thinking they're worthless so they shouldn't do anything to help themselves? What support groups or novel forms of therapy should I suggest? How do I deal with my growing anger at working 1.5 jobs and coming home to an unemployed emotionally needy person who watches TV 12 hours a day and refuses to do chores but I have to walk on eggshells around her while she refuses to change anything about her situation?",

I think I just need to leave altogether. However, a lot of subs have been helpful with my experiences of sexual assault, anxiety and depression, and abuse by a partner. I want to know if there are other platforms like this out there? I cannot afford therapy. \n\nI know some people might say to leave the subs that I find troubling, but I think it is at the point where I just want to leave reddit altogether. Partly because I do not think I can stop obsessing over the posts that I find troubling. Also because I feel like there is a decent amount of people on reddit that are not very kind to the experiences I have faced and possibly would defend the people who have caused hardship for me. Those people are not on subs like these probably, but I still do not feel comfortable posting on reddit at all because it feels less safe now. \n\nAny thoughts would help!",

If you just try and box up our negative feelings and experiences, one day they won't like being shoved down anymore and they will come out with a bang. I was listening to this podcast and it was about healing from birth trauma (which is another form of trauma) and it was all about ways to cope; specifically finding the root of emotions so that way the problem can be addressed. Some of the principles in this podcast episode helped me so so much and I wish I could explain better the principles. It has been g great resource for me and hopefully this episode could be a good resource for you. I'll post a link in the comments for anyone that is interested.

I'm not sure how to tag triggers or what specifically to warn about, but this post contains drug use and cpr.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n5 nights ago I was out at a friend's place watching movies. When I came home I found my partner of 6 years outside, unresponsive, blue, and not really breathing. He's not really a regular drug user, just cocaine a few times a year. I don't use at all, and of course have warned him that the drug supply is not safe and that he was putting himself at grave risk. He made a terrible choice. I had to start CPR and call 911, I've never been so scared. Thankfully the paramedics arrived quickly. He spent the night in the ER, he was severely hypothermic and hypoxic. I don't believe in miracles, but if I did this would be one. He is mostly totally okay. \nI'm struggling. I don't think I've ever felt so many feelings, I'm totally emotionally labile. Fine one moment and crying the next. I keep seeing flashes of him lying there and feeling that fear. I'm shaky. I can't get to sleep, but my doctor has given me something to help. Sounds are bothering me. I'm tense. I have a lot of support, but I feel alone. I think partly because he had a totally different experience. He doesn't remember what happened and is just trying to move forward and do better for himself. And I think he's hiding a bit from it all out of shame. He is supportive, but not talking much. \nI'm trying to do as much as I can for myself to process this \"properly.\" I've had a trauma in the past surrounding the death of my Mom that I ignored and ran from. As hard as it is to deal with something in the moment, it's harder to try and backtrack and deal years later. I've got a counsellor and am giving myself a lot of space to feel and be kind to myself. She recommended writing down the experience, which I did. Beyond that though I don't really know what to do to help myself. I don't know much theory about trauma. If anyone has any links to direct me to I would really appreciate it.\nI also feel so guilty. Like a kind of survivor's guilt, I guess? So many beautiful people have died from drug overdoses and our tainted drug supply. Why were we so lucky. I'm grateful.",

    "title": "I must remember that I am strong! I survived!",
    "selftext": "This is long and ended up a trauma dump. But oh well, enjoy I guess.\n\nFrom the ages of 3-11 I was abused and molested by a neighbour girl (a year or two older than me) and her parents. I have only recently reported it after the memory burst intonky kind one day as a barrage of flashbacks.\n\nI survived!\n\nFrom primary school to the very end of highschool so 5-16 I was bullied relentlessly. Physically and verbally I was treated like an animal someone hated. I had very few true friends and only one of them went to my highschool.\n\nIt's thanks to those freinds I have survived to this day.\n\nFrom 11-16 I was molested by a man 5 years older than me. This was an almost daily occurance and he had a girl my age and a disabled girl with the mental age of a 5 year old join in. The guy and the girl my age would teach her what to do to md. The poor girl had no idea that she was torturing me because she thought it was a game.\n\nI survived.\n\nAge 12 a girl in school kicked me so hard in the stomach she caused my appendix to swell to the point I needed it removed. Then when I returned to school 3 girls ganged up on me and kicked the stitches out of me.\n\nI literally survived someone's attempt to kill me.\n\nAge 16 I lost my virginity to a man who was 23. He was too rough and left me bleeding for a week. I tried to get out of the relationship because he was a neo Nazi but he wouldn't let me leave. I finally got the courage to leave after I find out he is sleeping with my 13 year old cousin. He then went on to murder a man for being gay a year later. The body wasn't found for years, so I found out when I was 21. I had to give him a character reference and give the police a statement describing losing my virginity, every horrid painful gruesome detail. This was then read out in court. \n\nI still survived \n\nStill at 16 I found out I have a life long condition that will only get worse for the rest of my life. It is the first of many. \n\nI'm still surviving through the pain caused by this daily. I now have over 20 conditions and they're life altering. I am an electric wheelchair user because of constant dislocations. I can dislocated a shoulder or a hip just by sleeping funny.\n\nAge 18-19 I was in a physically abusive with a 27 year old. He beat me to the point my joints would dislocate from my body. I only left him because I was forced to by freindsz after he beat me in my workplace so badly my whole left side was dislocated (shoulder, hip, knee, elbow and wrist). My friends wouldn't let me go back to the first home I ever rented. \n\nThanks to my parents and friends I got through that.\n\n19 I was sexually assaulted by a freinds flat mate when I tried to leave their house. He grabbed me and dragged me into the room and threatened people's safety if I screamed. The flat mates were all disabled except him. I believed he would hurt them. The police didn't believe me because \"no-one heard anything \"\n\nI almost didn't survive that. \n\n19 again I met a 30 year old man who taught me what swinging was. He included tricking me into sleeping with people older than my own parents. The swinging was fun but kicked off a sex addiction which lead to me sleeping with over 300 men and women combined. He took me on expensive dates and bought me presents but wouldn't let me meet his son. I just this moment realised now I was a sugar baby and just didn't bloody know it! Anyway one day he came to pick me up for a swingers party and I was trying out a wheelchair as part of my physio and I was practicing in the dorm common room which had all around windows. He saw me through the window, made a face, dropped the roses he bought me and left. He later text me saying he \"COULDN'T SEE ME AS SEXY ANYMORE BECAUSE HE COULDN'T GET THAT IMAGE OUT OF HIS HEAD!\"\n\nScrew that guy but I survived him and learned swinging is more fun in my control.\n\nTRIGGER WARNING SUICIDE DISCUSSED A LOT AFTER THIS.\n\nAge 20 I took two overdoses as I couldn't handle everything that happened in my life so far. The first one caused my heart to stop and it had to be restarted.i was drunk out of my mind, I drank 2L of rum before I left the house (I still can't drink rum to this day) I remember nothing between passing out and waking up. I had an out of body experience during the OD, watching myself take the pills from across the room. As soon as the last pill (54) was in my mouth I snapped back into reality and regretted my decision. \nAlso during the OD recovery period I was allergic to one of the IV medications and nobody noticed me going into anaphylaxis. My mum came for a visit and Found me swollen and unable to breathe. The nurses had a change over and the new nurses just thought I was fat. \nThe second wasn't as many pills but I had drank three bottles of wine, a freind of mine slept with the guy I liked after I asked her to introduce me. I was in earshot. I rifled through the guys cupboards and found and took every pill I could find. Which fortunately was not enough. And again after the frenzy I snapped back into reality, I called one of my best friends (she was my maid of honour) and she drove as fast as she could breaking speed limits to come and get me. She drove my ass to the hospital to get my stomach pumped.\n\nThanks to my freinds, my quick thinking once my right mind kicked in, my mum for saving me from an ironic death and especially the ambulance staff and the doctors who literally brought me back to life. I survived.\n\nAge 20 I meet my son's father. We were together for four years. During this time we became engaged and set our wedding date, bought the dress, spent ¬£10k on a wedding in a castle. He ended things while I was in hospital on life support. But let's rewind just a little bit, from day one I told him that my condition would worsten throughout my life and had many comorbidities (conditions it can cause) and I would deteriorate. We decide to have a baby sooner rather than later as the older I am the less likely I am to survive pregnancy. I go through pregnancy aged 21-22 with my son with a 3% chance of survival, this dropped to a 0.01% if I have a C-section. I went through 3 days of full blown labor with no dialation. The doctors had never seen anything like it before (this will be explained soon). \n\nI survived a C-section after the most painful labour for three freaking days! Thanks once again to amazing skilled doctors and nurses, HCAs and other hospital staff!\n\nAge 22 diagnosed with a 1-1million medical condition that causes bones to fuse wrong. I have an open fontanelle but fused pieces in my spine and a FUSED PELVIS! This is why I didn't dialate! It was physically impossible as my pelvis couldn't move to adjust. It was also why I suffered massive pelvic pain at the final trimester.\n\nI'm surviving despite this and all my other conditions!\n\nAge 24 I feel a pain in my chest and I am struggling to breathe. I ask my fianc√©, the father of my child to drive me to the hospital. He says no because he will be late to his new job (my brother in law was his boss) so I push my manual wheelchair to the bus stop slowly but surely. I make it to the bus stop and promptly collapse to the floor. I wake up surrounded by people, all neighbours who knew me from the estate. They had a blanket around me and a pillow under me, they asked me where I lived and I whispered the number while pointing down the road. They ran and got my fianc√©. He gets there just after I am loaded into the ambulance, he asks if I Will be okay, the paramedics shared a look and said they didn't know. They asked if he was coming and he said he was going to work and walked away without so much as an \"I love you\". I find out my lungs are coated in blood clots and had to undergo procedures to break them down. I couldn't breathe alone and couldn't talk. He waited 3 days before coming to the hospital didn't call once to check if was okay either, he then sat across from me and said this exact phrase \"I CAN'T HANDLE YOUR HEALTH ANYMORE!\" and called off our marriage and told me not to come home. Not to come home to my home, in my name, adapted for my needs as a wheelchair user.  So when I was ready for release out of the hospital I was asked my address for the ambulance drop off and I had a breakdown. I didn't have an address to give them. I had to call my mum and ask her to take me in. She opened her home to me and my son, though I moved into a friend's house after a week for my mental health. I lived with my friend for 6 months with my baby in a travel cot. This was my first time being homeless. I had to find a house for me and my baby. I finally did but we have now moved 5 x in 8 years.\n\n I survived another health scare and the end of the life I had planned ahead with the first man who had treated me right.\n\nAge 25 my son's dad met a new girl, she has become my son's step mother and my ex's wife. I'm fine with her these days but back then I wasn't because of overstepping boundaries from her. Admittedly I'll thank her for this, my son's dad hadn't seen him in 8 months because he didn't want to see me. She told him \"if you don't start acting like a dad I'm never giving you kids\" unfortunately they then fought for full custody and I got supervised only visits. My son's dad acted like my conditions were worse than I let on.\n\nI survived this and now have full shared custody. Though his dad takes him if I am in hospital or too ill.\n\nAge 25 I meet my soulmate. He is the most kindhearted, warmest, sweetest, caring, most wonderful souls in the universe. The yin to my yang. My everything. We were a swinging duo to be envied. I loved everything about him and he was the perfect other half. If I could turn back time I would have never left. I would hog tie the old me in a basement and throw away the key to live a lifetime with him on my arm. Anyway not the point, the point is I royally fucked up. I suddenly had an urge to go back to uni again in the place I was assaulted. I saw it as an opportunity to face my past and get over my trauma (spoiler alert it didn't work)!. So off I move 100 miles away from everything. Including my son. Yeah I had a psychotic break I'm pretty sure after all the stress my son's dad caused.\n\nI survived this with so much regret.\n\n\n27I meet my soon to be ex husband. We met online, had a whirlwind romance where we were living together in 2 weeks and married at 5 months in. The first year and a half of marriage was bliss, then c-19 hit. Suddenly we were stuck together 24/7 which to begin with was great, then we both became depressed and frustrated, but he took.his frustration out on me. He withheld sex, using it as a weapon, started insulting me, ingraining into me that I was ugly, stupid, fat, lazy etc. A few times he has thrown stuff at me including a concrete hand casting kit. I finally left this year.\n\nNow I must concentrate on surviving through every day.\n\n30 left my abusive ex husband but had to live in the same house as him. The day after I told him things were over he sexually assaulted me in the early morning. I was forced to report it to the police when I broke down crying in my doctor's office. \n\nI'm still surviving...\n\n31 I finally got help from the homelessness team in my old area. I've been living in hotels for weeks and my ex husband is still abusing me from a distance guilt tripping me about my stuff taking up room, or our dog or anything he can come up with. \n\nI will get through this! I AM A SURVIVOR!\n\nNow this is a message for me. If you are reading this, you are doing enough, you are worth it, ask your freinds for help, you are beautiful, you are outgoing, you are an amazing mother, you do deserve love, you deserve to be happyn\n\nKeep on surviving!!",

Your success will be praised and your failures will be loved. And when you feel that you‚Äôre not enough. I will be there to show you you‚Äôre wrong. Thinking about having you is a dream. I feel like I was put on this earth to change the trajectory not only of my own life but for the ones I‚Äôm around. I will create art. I will create love. You will be you. You‚Äôll never have to hide from me. You‚Äôll never have to be afraid that I won‚Äôt support you. You wanna cut someone‚Äôs breaks? Grab me the snips. You want to sit and have a shoulder to cry on, I got two. You need to feel heard, I‚Äôll get you a mic. You want to be in silence, here‚Äôs some noise canceling headphones. You want to stay up and eat cookie dough and dance our feet off, where‚Äôs my insoles? I never want you to be hurt by me. I want you to be able to learn from me. What I don‚Äôt want you to have is what I was taught. Now that I‚Äôm unlearning all of these bad habits and narcissistic ways I find myself pondering about what I don‚Äôt understand. Thinking how I can have so much love, but yet have been hurt so much. My parents never wanted me, they were never meant to be parents. And that‚Äôs the difference. I dream to be the best mother any kid could have. I dream that one day when my kid is faced with a challenge that instead of backing down. they ask for support. I want them to be able to go through hard times and instead of yelling and telling them they aren‚Äôt enough or making them fight for my love. I will give them my undivided attention. I want is to give my kid the life I always wanted. No it won‚Äôt be filled with money and big houses or cars. But the real fortune of love, kind, and strong parents who‚Äôs only goal is to have their kid learn life lessons without having to be traumatized. The generational trauma stops with me. This is something I will always stand by. So until then I will keep learning, I will keep healing, and I will keep loving everyday until I‚Äôm ready for you. Love, your future mom‚ù§Ô∏è",

I was walking to the bus stop and suddenly I see a pedestrian get hit by a car going pretty fast. I've seen car accidents before and I've even been in one, but seeing the person get hit and go flying was really shocking to me. I was even more terrified because they weren't moving when they hit the ground. After staying with other witnesses, making sure they were breathing and had a pulse, and calling emergency services, I just can't get the event out of my head. They were alive and breathing, but they were clearly pretty injured and weren't conscious. After they were taken by paramedics and I had talked with the police, I felt like passing out.\n\nTo be a bit graphic: the pedestrian was hit really hard and they were thrown about 20 ft before hitting a curb. When I and the other witnesses got to them, they weren't moving and there was blood coming out of their mouth and somewhere else. Emergency response was super fast and the driver was also there making sure the pedestrian was okay, but it was really hard to watch them get put into the ambulance and not know if they were going to be okay or not. I've been obsessively checking for any updates on the situation but I haven't found anything about it. \n\nThis event really scared me. I've never seen something like that before and it was a lot to just walk away not knowing what happened to the person who got hit. I feel really ill and I don't know what to do about feeling better.",

I had just moved to a new city for university and didn't have a job or anyone around me to support me.

    "selftext": "Hi there, \n\nI hope this message is acceptable on this forum. I wanted to share a bit of my trauma story to encourage those who may be going through a rough time and searching for the light at the end of the tunnel - it's definitely there! \n\nA few years ago I developed a bizarre neurological condition called conversion syndrome. The difficult part about this condition is that it has no known immediate triggers or causes and doctors often have a very hard time picking it up. In my case it took months, several hospital visits and neurologists and doctors. One day I woke up and had lost my speech and my motor function. It was terrifying. My presentation was like that of a stroke patient, except that I was fully compus mentus inside and knew what was going on within and around me etc. The only way I could express myself was by writing letters, which I did prodigiously for 3 months. It was extremely distressing and traumatic seeing as I am usually a very healthy and active person! (thankfully I am back to that!) It took 3 months to come out of it, which is a long time to be in a state of acute traumatic stress. \n\nBut eventually the crisis became a blessing. It literally forced my consciousness into a space where I could only handle one moment at a time. If I thought to much or worried too much, my brain could not handle it and I started tremors. Eventually it became clear to me that the quality of my thoughts affected my physical state, seeing as I would literally stop shaking when I thought about getting better. At many stages I did not know if I was ever going to recover, and that was scary, but anyway I decided to use my mental energy in the direction of thinking about good health and wellness and recovery. And it worked! I literally visualized myself trail running and hiking and surfing again, and after a few months, those all came true! I did have the help of physiotherapy and daily exercises, but I'm convinced that visualization and thinking positively aided my full recovery. I learned so much about how the brain can reorganize itself after a traumatic event, and with a bit of intention, begin to rewire for healing and recovery. I am so grateful for the experience because I am sensitive and compassionate to other people's traumas now and I can listen and understand. \n\nI'm happy to say that I'm in the best mental, emotional, physical and spiritual state I've ever been - full recovery from any trauma is totally possible! The state of consciousness of living moment by moment has not left me, because I am fully aware of how it stresses my system out if I'm too much in past or future. I practice mindfulness and visualization every day and I love it. I am fascinated by the resilience of the nervous system and the body's ability to heal. \n\nI just wanted to share to encourage anyone recovering from trauma - your nervous system is resilient! With a few tools, and some love and support you can heal! There is light at the end of your dark tunnel, I can assure you of that! What lies beyond your trauma recovery is bliss beyond words. \n\nTo your healing and recovery, because you deserve it!",

When we were together 6 years ago I found out she was engaged to someone else so that's why I broke it off and cut her off.¬†¬† \n\nShe ended up getting divorced a year after her marriage, she did admit to having a few relationships afterwards. We got close and had some nice moments but I kept noticing how open she is with other guys and how she'd claim that every other guy was interested in her, she kept pushing me for marriage and kept blaming me for moving too slow just because I didn't want to rush in to marriage.¬†¬†¬† \n\nEverytime we'd argue about it, she would always say that it's my fault that things are moving slow and that she doesn't like being with someone who can't commit.¬†She would always say how she wants someone who loves her more than she loves themselves, that's not normal right?? And She always used to say that she wanted me to open up to her and tell her how I feel and that I can talk to her about anything if I'm ever upset. So I did when I mentioned that I didn't like how open she is with other guys, she said that she didn't want to be with anyone that's insecure just like her ex husband was (even though she'd already cheated on her ex husband with me which was unknown to me at the time, so he had a reason to feel insecure).¬†¬† \n\nI don't get why she'd tell me to talk to her about anything then end up throwing it back in my face!¬†I told her I'm not happy so we agreed to end it, I was confused at first cos she used to tell me that she misses me everyday and after that conversation she ended up blocking me off everything at the startwhich I thought was childish.¬†¬† We had an argument a few weeks before the break up in which she said \"if we ever break up, it will be your loss\".\n\nAt that moment in time, I actually felt worthless and believed her when she said it would be my loss because I thought I didnt deserve better but now I realise I do and that I rather stay single than to be involved with someone like her.¬†I do miss her but I just want to heal and move on cos I know she's not good for me, and to help myself heal I am planning to stay away from relationships for a while and to do this I am planning on putting more focus on to my career (currently IT graduate, planning to advance my career by undertaking more software engineering certificates to enhance my career). I have also joined the gym now as another way to heal and improve mentally & physically and to keep myself busy.¬†¬† \n\nWe broke up 6 months ago but she messaged me on Christmas day saying:¬†'I just wanted to message you to say that I hope you‚Äôre okay and that I feel as though I‚Äôm ready to stay as friends with you if that‚Äôs what you wanted.. I didn‚Äôt think I would ever be able to say that we could stay as friends but I feel like I‚Äôm in a good place and I know everything has worked out for the best and I would be really happy to have you as a friend¬†But if you don‚Äôt want to hear from me that‚Äôs okay too just let me know x'¬†I did reply to her saying that I don't think it's a good idea and I wished her well. She just replied with a simple 'that's fine no worries x'.¬† \n\nI'm trying to not think about her messaging me, but I feel like I was really getting in to the healing process and was really focused on other aspects of my life such as my career. I know I deserve better but I see her quite often as we live near one another and I can't help but still feel hurt and a part of me still misses her. We were quite sexually active together and i think thats whats making me miss her more. I know I won't probably move on straight away but I don't know why I'm still hurting over someone that is so toxic for me.¬† \n\nShe sent me a chain message about 2 weeks ago about charity but I haven't replied, I was confused as she never sent stuff like that before and I hadn't heard from her since Christmas. I blocked her on social media a few months back but i never blocked her number, however i have finally decided to do that today. I know shes not good for me so i just wsnt to forget about her and move on but im struggling please help",

I‚Äôm not sure anymore really. I can‚Äôt trust what I once believed. What I once felt. \n\nSome of me earliest memories are of me fucking around with my friends in Brooklyn. Taking the N to the city, trying to bum loosies for a $1. I was 9‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶free f‚Ä¢cking spirit baby. My parents raised me that way. Make mistakes, don‚Äôt sweat the small shit, live life and move on. I can see myself now. No, really‚Ä¶..I can see it. I feel it. I smell it. I emote it. My brain in some kinda gift/curse way allows to me to play my memories as movies. I see it right in front of my face clear as f*cling day. I can replay it, zoom in, walk around in it.

They consume me at times. \n\nThis would be great, and it was great, when all your memories are happy and ‚Äúloving‚Äù. But what if your brain royally f‚Ä¢ked u?

No one hated me? yeah my dad left when I was 2, yeah my step dad, although kind, compassionate and such an amazing person, was and to this f‚Äôking day a ‚Äúrecovering‚Äù alcoholic. Maybe your brain only allows you to see what it wants you to see, or maybe it only allows you to see it but not understand what‚Äôs happening‚Ä¶.almost like watching a foreign film with no subtitles. \n\nI have multiple memories that my brain never lets go of. They play over and over in my head all day. They are my happy memories. Even as I speak to people at work I can see them in the back of my head playing. It‚Äôs amazing. One of these memories is the day my daughter was born. And as I held her there I was so excited to allow her to have the childhood I had. All my ‚Äúhappy‚Äù memories flooded my brain. \n\nMy parents tried their best to raise me right but obviously living in New York. It costs a lot of money. Thankfully, my mom knew and went to school with a chiqe 90s sitter that was super reasonable and lived in a super safe (wealthy) area. Also helped that they shared the same, free love, yuppie lifestyles. It was a no brainer for my parents. I went almost every day. From early morning, until almost 10 pm. For almost 9 years. You get the point I was there a lot. This woman become my second mom. I loved her. She loved me. It felt like unconditional love, something I‚Äôve never felt again. I‚Äôve been chasing it in my love life my whole entire life. I need it. I crave that kind of love. She opened her home to me. I slept over for days sometimes. I went on vacations with her. I went to her summer houses with her. \n\nI remember being picked up from school one day by her and I just knew even at a young age that something was wrong. She took me to a shoe store near her apartment and let me pick out any shoe I wanted. I remember walking around that shoe store feeling safe. And I remember picking out a pair of nhl shoes. When it was all said and done I remember asking her why she was doing this. ‚ÄúBecause you are special‚Äù. \n\nI wanted this for my daughter. And as I held her the day she was born, one of my happy memories Flicked into my view. The sitter standing there. In the shower naked. Smiling. Reaching out to me. One of my most treasured memories. I often revisited this one. It‚Äôs in first person. Just like all my other happy memories I can feel them. Smell them. Play them in first person and relive them. Over and over and over I play this one through out my entire life. And I never realized it until that day‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶I was sexually abused by someone I loved, no, worshiped and trusted. \n\nI will spare you the rest of the details of this memory. Out of total shame and disgust I won‚Äôt go in more detail. This went on for many years, eventually, a bf turned into married, turned into kid, turned into it ending. I now remember feeling so abandoned back then. Since then, I have been an emotional wreck. How could my brain before this day possibly perceive this as a good memory!? In what world would this be okay for any adult to do with a child?! How could I go through life as a ‚Äúsane‚Äù , well grounded, educated man reliving this memory over and over and enjoy it? Loath it?! Want it?! Use it as a coping mechanism?! I‚Äôm out of my mind, or just very very stupid. \n\nI have spiraled out of control with self hate, hateful imagery and thoughts, anger, irritation. Crying at work in the bathroom for no reason. Emotional rollercollaster day in and out for almost 2 years. Racing thoughts. Paranoia, possible mania and psychosis. \n\nBut, f‚Äôck u sitter.

I was beaten every time I cried or for no reason. I was dumped in trash bin and then beaten. I was put into an orphanage when the master used to abuse us as kids. \n\nI was adopted by an amazing family that took me in and treated me like I was their own... but I never felt I fitted in I always feel like I am a burden to everybody. \n\nLife growing up was tough. I got bullied in primary school because of the colour of my skin ( tanned ) I was hit, jumped ( attacked ) and bullied online for years. Things got so bad that I physically broke bones in my body. I was told I was a waste of space that I would be better off dead so I tired multiple times to end it but I never succeeded. \n\nI was sexually groomed at the age of 11 till the age of 16. But I wasn‚Äôt only groomed online I was groomed and raped multiple times in person by those men. I was a victim of Human trafficking and I never told anyone and I made up lies about the bruises as I didn‚Äôt want anyone to find out. I was caught in multiple pedofile rings and they videos me being raped and posted it all over the world. It‚Äôs like my life is only gonna get worse I thought and it did. \n\n\nAt the age of 16 after all of that I couldn‚Äôt cope with the pain I was feeling. So I drank and self harmed and tried to commit suicide multiple times but it never worked. To cope with all the pain I slept with a lot of ppl and let them abuse me as that‚Äôs all I was used to I thought that was love but it wasn‚Äôt.  \n\nI have been in many abusive relationships that I don‚Äôt know how to handle love or affection. I always push people away before they get to close as I never knew what it was like to be wanted. \n\nSo as I said at the start of this I have had a boyfriend the last two months and he is the most genuine man I know. He does everything to try and help me eg, stay up with me if I am crying tries to comfort me as much as he can. He talks to my parents to see what else he can do to help me. He says he loves me and I know he does because he means everything he says but I just feel I‚Äôm just a waste of space. His family adores me and my family adores him. Both our families say we are soulmates and so does he but why am I not on bored with this ? \n\nWith my past I always felt that no one could love me or even want me but when I finally was gonna give up ( take my own life ) he txts me as says would you like to go on a date and ever since then we have been inseparable. He has saved me to the place where I don‚Äôt know how to thank him. \n\nEvery time I am with him I feel happy and then all of a sudden I get a flash back from my past and I cry. \n\nI just wish I was normal. \n\nSorry for this being so long",

He strangled me to the point where my vision went black, and I thought I was going to die. Everything is a blur. But for some reason, at one point, he got off of me and ran into my kitchen.

    "selftext": "That's the image that came into my mind when I was trying to think of how I am feeling as of late. Like in the movie the Mist when there are all those abandoned vehicles every where? Only my vehicles are running, with headlights blazing and someone at the wheel. \n\nI have suffered a lot of trauma in my life. The apex being the death of my son to accidental suicide a few years ago. It has brought all of my other past traumas to the surface; multiple rapes both familial and acquaintances , physical and mental abuse, etc. Since my son died I have been barely functional, on occasion borderline nervous breakdowns, suicidal thoughts (although I would never take that step the ruminations of how much easier it would be to give up kinda of thoughts do happen sometimes) .....so yeah it's been difficult on me. \n\nThen add this lovely pandemic and I live in an area where people are still not wearing masks NOR social distancing. I have even gotten into verbal altercations with people both getting upset because I chose to remain social distant (yeah it really happened...got ugly at the local DG) or getting pissy because I ask them to remain social distant when they didn't have a mask on. As a very social person, staying quarantined has been counter productive to my mental health battle. \n\nI feel there is no terminology for what my mental health issues are because it's a sprinkling of this, a scoop of that and a lathering of the other on top. As most women, I got placed in the bi-polar umbrella predominantly because my mother was diagnosed. I believe the best way to accurately describe it would be to visualize a veteran with PTSD. The same way they react to certain situations bringing them back physically to those traumatic experiences, the same happens for me on an emotional level.  So while my intellect ***knows*** I am no longer in the experience, ***emotionally*** I react as if I still am in that horrible experience. Then sprinkle in those OCD unwanted thoughts and compulsions. Fueled by the anger of knowing this isn't how I want to be reacting ***and*** the unwillingness of those around me to understand how little control over how I am reacting. \n\nMy new therapist says it's the smaller regulating part of my brain reacting to what it perceives as a threat. It's a physical reaction to past trauma. I am getting SO much better at dealing with all of this lately, in part because of the isolation. I have been allowing myself to feel what I feel and reflect/self evaluate.  Becoming more clear, out of the fog if you will, I am learning the environment in which I currently have (social circles and lack of, local community, home life, etc.) is definitely counterproductive to my success. I have surrounded myself with people who trigger me even when told they are. People who are so non-self aware, filled with self-destructive behaviors while dragging you into their drama. Yeah just a plethora of traffic on this highway.\n\nSo I am looking forward to the new journey on a winding back country road. Where I can meet people at those cool side of the road antique stores or farmers markets. Where I can discuss theories on ancient civilizations and the like. Leaving behind the ridiculous superficiality that 99% of the people I know are living. It is not a life I desire nor will I willingly put myself into.",

    "selftext": "If you‚Äôve ever been in a place where you‚Äôre feeling low or life just feels like a grind, you might have asked the question, what is it all about? There‚Äôs no shortage of influencers who want to provide you with answers, especially on TV or social media. They‚Äôll tell you through their words or actions that you need to be richer, more successful or attractive, have kids or be in a relationship.\n\nBut lets take a step back and think about what the meaning of life is in two categories. The first is making ourselves happy, very few people would pick something that is designed to make them miserable; the second is being part of something bigger than ourselves. From a mindfulness perspective, both of these are actually very easy to answer.\n\nWhen we think about what we want for ourselves, we tend to think of the outside conditions we desire for our lives to have meaning. That might be achieving something in our careers, or getting some kind of recognition. But this is a bit like watching a 2 hour movie for one interesting minute towards the end or travelling for 24 hours to spend an afternoon in New Zealand. What about before and after that fleeting moment of happiness - we can spend our whole lives grinding towards some purpose without actually being happy in the here and now.\n\nSo our conclusion might be that the meaning of life is to be happy in each moment. How do we do this? The answer is to let go of the future and the past, enjoy the feeling of being alive, enjoy what is right in front of us. Our friends, our family, our breath, our body, the food we eat, the chair you‚Äôre sitting on, our thoughts, our feelings, the sunshine and the clouds, being present with whatever we‚Äôre experiencing. To shorten it down, from a mindfulness perspective, the meaning of life is to be.\n\nThis also applies to having a purpose greater than ourselves. The need that we have as humans to be part of something greater than ourselves comes from our altruism, the desire as a species to help and make each other happy. The best way we can do this is through the practice of compassion for those who are suffering. We don‚Äôt need to be part of Doctors Without Borders to do this, we can make it happen every day by building our practice, developing our calmness, training our awareness. When we‚Äôre calm and present, we become more aware of the suffering of other people and we feel compelled to act. When we‚Äôre present we really connect with other people and start to work together to make the work a better place.\n\nIn other words, to make ourselves happy and to make the world a better place the meaning of life is to be, to be present with what we‚Äôre experiencing in the present moment. \n\n[Listen On Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/whats-my-purpose-in-life/id1493806566?i=1000502923653)\n\n[Listen On Google Podcasts](https://www.google.com/podcasts?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9hbmNob3IuZm0vcy8xMjNkZThlMC9wb2RjYXN0L3Jzcw==)\n\n[Listen On Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/1ozwIEgzEtHQezPoi83nVV)\n\n[Other ways to listen](https://anchor.fm/shaun-donaghy/episodes/Whats-my-purpose-in-life-eo0nhg)",

They told me that what I was currently feeling (hyperventilating, feeling shaky and weak on my knees and hands, and then outright crying) was a trauma response. I'm still crying right now but it's gotten slightly less worse than it was shortly before. Is there any way to stop this? I know what causes me to feel this way but it's impossible for me to stop it because the source is my family. Long story short, my history of being bullied was a big factor. My family uses this against me when I don't do something the way they want. I mean specifically my mom. She does this to spite me and fully knows about how I respond yet doesn't regard how I feel about this. I feel horrible all the time because of her and it irks me beyond indescribable words.\n\nHow do I cope with this?\n\nEdit: It takes about 20 minutes for me to get over the feeling but in those 20 minutes, I feel horrible and it feels like an eternity. It takes a whole lot longer for me to stop feeling this way and often I cry in front of them, which makes things so much more worse. I wish I had a place for crying alone but because I don't, everything just hurts.",

    "selftext": "Hi there! I found this reddit page and think it might be useful so I joined. So here's my story. I have been dealing with Phone Call Anxiety (and anxiety in general) for the longest time because of things that happened in my past (I'm not gonna get into it now otherwise we'll be here forever). It is so bad that whenever I hear a phone ring, I tense up and go into panic mode. I'm currently looking to get a job, but when potential employers call, I go into panic mode again and refuse to pick up the call, and I'm missing alot of opportunities. I was thinking, are there any tips or tools to deal with this? Or to temporary prepare myself to deal with this? Thank you!",

Even if i really want to hug and hold my own friends and family it's incredibly uncomfortable for me to the point of crying or lashing out if it goes on for too long or I'm caught by suprise. I didn't think it was that bad when I was a child, I naturally was very hyper and always wanted to get around, so I'd always slip out of people's grasp and bite and no one thought anything of it‚Äî including me. Just that maybe I was a little less social than others? Or a rascal. \n\nThe issue is now I'm a lot more aware of my trauma, I understand what happened however im guessing I sat on it for too long. People touching me often winds up in extreme reactions I struggle to control, like sudden burst of fear and very hard shoving and griping arms and such. I'll be fine saying I'll hug someone or shake their hands but the moment it's coming up I dread it and try to end it as fast as I possibly can if I know it's gonna happen. I'm no good at hiding it, obviously, I'm very expressive unfortunately. It's upsetting because I really can't bring myself to explain to people why I panic the way I do when they're just trying to be kind to me. I've been told I should just get exposure therapy but for obvious reasons I fear it greatly. \n\nI can't explain how much I hate feeling the way I do about this, it's basically ruining my life at this point.

    "selftext": "Hi. This might already have been answered here, as I haven't searched extensively before posting. Forgive me if I repeat a probably frequent question. I'll try to be brief and specific.\n\nI suspect that the birth of my son left me with some kind of a trauma that makes it hard for me to experience joy in being a mother. Birth and childbed were extremely hard for me, though they maybe weren't very special medically speaking. I think I have trauma because I keep bringing it up in conversations almost involuntarily, because it still hurts to think about, and because I'm still have trouble genuinely liking my kid even though he is three by now.\n\nCan anyone point me to resources that help to confront past trauma alone? I am thinking of something like structured writing, but could be something else completely. I am pretty sure I know what the moment in time is where I broke. I need to have a deeper look at that, and at underlying issues. I'm pretty confident I can do it, I'm just not sure how exactly to go about it. \n\nI have been in cognitive behavioral therapy but it hasn't helped me at all. Felt like sticking a band-aid on a broken limb instead of acknowledging the hurt. I am, in parallel to asking you here, looking for other therapeutic options: a psychiatrist and some mild medication to help lift the fog of depression. I'm just trying to also see what I can more actively contribute to healing myself.",

    "selftext": "Hello to whoever reads this. I don't really want to disclose my age, but I'm a young adult male. \n\nWhen I was 12, I began to be groomed online by pedophiles online via webcam. I didn't understand that it wasn't consensual, and I thought that I was going to hell because I was gay and that I had done sexual things with men. I thought that God hated me, and I hated myself. Because of this, and embarrassment, I revved-up a quiet cycle of self-hatred and self-harm that had already been somewhat there. Yet, for some reason, I kept going back to these pedophiles. \n\nI never had a lot of confidence as a kid, and was constantly insecure about my looks and weight. I've always had problems with validation and I think I wanted it badly. I saw girls' affection as unattainable, and therefore thought I could only get it through these pedophiles. And I had no sense of self-validation. I still don't.\n\nI never stopped talking to older men, despite being straight. I don't know why I keep going back. It's isolating, unfulfilling, stigmatizing and it creates a high-level of cognitive dissonance that sent me spiraling into depression a little over a year back. Whenever I did date girls, I still had insecurity and a need for over-validation. And now, through a failed relationship, I've become a recluse when it comes to girls and dating. I hate dating girls for no good reason: because I had a bad relationship. Because I only care about validation, and harming myself in any psychological way possible. It feels physically good, and it's come to be all I care about. Like a 5-pack-a-day smoker.\n\nIt's getting bad. Whenever I feel a little stress or something I don't want to do I go back to camming with older men who see me as nothing but an object. I also only see my body as an object. As a tool to get what I want, which is physical validation. And I still have a metric ton of self-hatred. It's so ingrained in me that I don't even realize it. I feel completely out of touch with my masculinity. It's non-existent. And all of this causes me to completely lose touch with reality.\n\nI can't improve myself or my life, because I hate myself. I think, \"Fuck me. Why would I want to help that guy? I'll just do what's physically pleasurable, even though it goes against the very nature of my sexual being\" (I have nothing against gay people, but I'm very obviously attracted to girls). \n\nI don't know how to stop. It feels like I can't. It's killing my personality and killing me every day of my life. Sometimes I workout so hard that I come close to vomiting as an energy purge so I don't do it. I'm almost completely numb to this, but I know it lies at the center of all the bad shit that ever goes on in my head. It's been a long time now. It feels like it's just who I am. It's really really unhealthy.\n\nHow can I stop? How can I get support? How can I learn to give girls a chance? To give myself a chance?",

    "selftext": "I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm here posting this. A week ago my life seemed mostly normal. I have a wife who is the center of my world, and two kids I love to death. And now I‚Äôm alone in an extended stay motel not knowing which way is up. \n\n\nWe‚Äôve been having issues with our teen daughter for 5-6 years now. She‚Äôs getting ready to graduate HS soon. Her grandfather passed away years ago and she seemed really out of sorts afterwards. We got her a psychologist who said she was fine after a few sessions. A couple of years later she seemed to crash really hard, and the same process with another psychologist. \n\n\nThen about two years ago her grades started to crash. We caught her using marijuana. Her friend group was getting a lot smaller and her friends were definitely not the quality friends she had in the past. We went through her room trying to find what was wrong and found journals with suicidal comments. We took her to the mental hospital for an eval and they said  she was not an immediate threat to herself.  We got her a therapist who she has been working with for about two years now. Minor progress has been made, but she has slipped in other ways. She finally got her first boyfriend. Her friend group got a little better. Her grades improved a little bit, but not much. The therapist said maybe she has ADHD. We got her a neuropsychiatric evaluation which said she was suffering from depression and anxiety. Got her a psychiatrist who treated her for those with barely any improvement. Then they reevaluated and said maybe it was ADHD. ADHD meds seemed to help the best so far. But, she lies to us constantly. Not always in the hiding behaviors we won‚Äôt like, but just about everything. She used to be an amazing student who could have probably gotten college paid for, now she tells us when she turns 18 soon she is moving out, getting a job and not going to college. She avoids doing things with us as much as possible. On Easter she spent some time with us, but then spent the evening with her boyfriends family. \n\n\nWe also have a son who has no real issues. We don‚Äôt want her to influence him. I was starting planning for our daughter leaving or me kicking her out. Or at least justifying giving her little to no help when she chose to leave soon. I started searching her room to find drugs or anything else I could use to justify this as she has completely torn our family apart. \n\n\nWhile in her room I don‚Äôt know why I picked up one of her journals. I didn‚Äôt care about her thoughts, I read some of them two years ago. But I picked it up and leafed through it. I opened it to a paragraph about her saying she was molested as a child and how she couldn‚Äôt tell a boy who liked her that was the reason she couldn‚Äôt be intimate with people.  This was the first I heard. My head raced on who it was. A babysitter we hired rarely? Her best friends dad who had a lot of access to her? A boy at school she was around a lot I didn‚Äôt like?\n\n\nFlipping backwards through the pages I begin to think she never says. Then I find it. My father. The grandfather we thought she was sad about year prior had repeatedly molested her through grade school. \n\n\nWe had often talked about leaving the area we live in as we don‚Äôt enjoy it here, but she only has my set of grandparents. We thought it was important the kids spend time around family. We not only stayed her so she could spend time with him, but would often come up with reasons for her to spend time with them. We handed her over to them. \n\n\nThat‚Äôs enough to make most people fall apart, but life wasn‚Äôt done with me yet. My wife and I had lunch a couple days later. She mentions how she was sometimes verbally abused and hit, but in general her parents loved her and she felt it. She said I shouldn‚Äôt feel as guilty about giving them access to our daughter as I felt they loved me when I was a kid. \n\n\nSomething snapped at that point. I didn‚Äôt feel that. Not love. I should have realized this before. When my father was dying I had dinner with my sister. She mentioned something in conversation to which I said something about it not applying to me because I was a bad kid. I really thought I was just trouble. She told me I was a good kid and it was just our home. I laughed and said that was the first time anyone said I was a good kid. I didn‚Äôt understand the full context of what she said. \n\n\nOnce my wife mentioned me being loved, a whole new set of childhood memories flooded my brain. I had forgotten these for decades. My grandmother lived with us when I was very young. She called me the Devil Child. She would babysit me and lie about things I did so I‚Äôd get in trouble. If my parents didn‚Äôt spank me hard enough over those things she would tell them that is why they were shitty parents and had a lying devil child. \n\n\nThere was a day as a teenager I argued with my mom. She got violent. I went to my room. She barged in and started beating me bad. I knew I couldn‚Äôt hit my mom or it would be worse so I had to do something. I pinned her to the bed and begged her to calm down and I‚Äôd let her go. When she came in she left the door open. That gave my dad the opportunity to silently come in. He removed me from my mom by means of a punch to the face which sent me flying off the bed. Then he and my mom continued to beat me together telling me I needed to learn to respect women.\n\n\nAnother time they were beating me and I was able to grab the phone. I started to dial 911 and they stopped. I looked up at them. They told me I could go ahead and call the police. When my had went towards the buttons again my dad told me, ‚ÄúBut when the police arrive they will arrest me for child abuse. The beating you are getting now isn‚Äôt worth me getting arrested over. Once you finish your call I‚Äôll give you a beating I feel would be worth it ‚Äú. I didn‚Äôt end up finishing the call and just laid there getting beat. \n\n\nMy sister used to hide during these beatings. I told my sister when these memories started to come back that I dreaded dinner. My parents during my adult life always were telling me the importance of family dinners, which I thought was weird because I didn‚Äôt have a lot of memories of them. Until this week. Dinner was the time for them to tell me all of the bad crap I needed to be punished for. Some days there were no issues. It was never at the same part of dinner. Sometimes dinner started with verbal and physical abuse. Sometimes ended with it. Sometimes they let me start to leave then called me back. My sister couldn‚Äôt hide during dinner. They made her sit there and witness it. \n\n\nThe list goes on of terrible things I‚Äôve remembered this week. I think I may have worse memories. I remember parts of days, like a day where I was playing with cars and blocks on the front sidewalk. What I remember isn‚Äôt bad, but my brain tells me bad things happened that day and won‚Äôt let me go there. \n\n\nBut it wasn‚Äôt all bad. My dad made me a great sandbox. It was really the best in the neighborhood and my friends often came to play in it. We went on decent vacations. My dad was involved in some of my activities and I never had bad things happen at them. We always had food, clothes, nice presents on birthdays and Christmas. We went on nice vacations sometimes. All of those things are true also and I can‚Äôt reconcile these two realities in my head.",

    "selftext": "When I was 16 that 31 year old man manipulated me into doing what he wanted me to do and I was happy to do so. When I was making him happy, he praised me, but when I was doing something wrong or something he didn't like, he punished me, called me names, suicide manipulated me, told me I was disappointing him like his older friends. He would silent treat me and that would kill me until I begged for an apology. He basically raised me into a person he wanted me to be for him. He had control over all my social media, as well as my geolocation. Now that I escaped, I experience severe anxiety on daily basis. I can't stop wanting to come back to him, so he could call me a good girl again. I can't feel safe and secure as long as I have mutual friends with him. She knows what he did, but she believes \"a good friend wouldn't cut someone off because of another friend they don't like\". I don't want to be a bad friend, because she's my childhood friend as well. We've been friends for 10 years and leaving her because of connection with my groomer will make her hate me. I don't know what to do. I want her to understand that that man traumatized me, but she doesn't figure it out. I don't know whether should I ask her to cut contacts with him to make me feel safer, or should I leave her as well for choosing to be friends with my groomer.\n\nBoth options are horrible to me. Any advice how can I help myself?\n\nFor future questions:\n\n1. I have had multiple therapy courses anxiety and trauma related. It did not help me feel safe.\n2. My friend knows about what he did to be, and she's his friend of 4 years, yet he never treated her the same way, so she doesn't have anything against him.\n3. She's my friend of 10 years from basically when we were 10. I would be leaving my best and only friend from all my teenage years.\n4. My parents never knew anything at the time and don't know to this day. They are very radical people and do not support therapy at the first place. It would only damage me more hearing \"just don't think about it\" from them.\n5. My groomer never made me do anything sexual for him, he has never confessed his romantic feelings towards me as well. We only spoke online.\n6. I never reported my groomer. And so I can not as the laws in my country do not choose to solve problems like this.  \n\n\nUPDATE: She called me a bad friend once again, said \"he's not a bad person, at least he doesn't make me abandon friends like you do\", removed me from friends everywhere and added him, so I blocked her. It's been a week without her and I actually feel safer and more comfortable. It still frustrates me that my friend betrayed me like that, but my mental health is overall much better. I'm starting to enjoy life again.",

    "title": "Gunpoint attempted carjacking and guilty for feeling traumatized",
    "selftext": "(Contextual story, then request for advice at the end.)\n\nSo, like 2 or 3 days ago I was outside of my friend's apartment on the phone with him waiting for him to decide if he was coming over or not. It's not the greatest part of town, but it wasn't \\*too\\* late and I was feeling less than nervous, I was in my car, doors locked, windows up, never experienced violent crime before, etc. That's to say I wasn't feeling scared or anxious that anything bad might happen.\n\n20 minutes on the phone pass and this white pickup truck passes me on the other side of the road and I think nothing of it. They stop just behind my car (facing the other direction) and I don't notice. I was just checking the notifications on my phone and 2 people come up to my driver-side window and one points a gun at me and says \"I'll f\\*cking shoot\" and the other says \"get out of the car\" and begins ripping at the door handle. I am absolutely paralyzed in fear and tell my friend over the phone \"\\[name\\] there's someone with a gun. Help.\"\n\nWhile I'm panicking, the person hits the driver's window in frustration that I'm not getting out and trying to break the window open. I hit the emergency button on my phone and the 2 people at my window got scared and ran back to the truck and drove away. By the time my friend had gotten outside, they were already gone and I was on the phone with 911. I barely caught a glimpse of the vehicle, and even in my panicked state thought to get the license plate #, but I couldn't see it.\n\nRegardless, dispatch gets police headed in my direction and patrols out to look for the vehicle I described to them, alongside the best description I could give of the 2 people at my window. They took my statement and said that they had people out looking for the truck and they'd update me if they found anyone.\n\nI head home with my friend (about 20 minutes) and on my way I see a police car FLYING down one of the roads. All I could think was \"Get them\" and commented to my friend that maybe they found the vehicle. As I'm pulling into my condo parking lot I get a call, it's the police, and they ask me to come to the scene of the end of a vehicle pursuit with the suspect vehicle to identify the suspects.\n\nThere were 4 of them. The first one I knew was the one with the gun, the second one was the other one that was pulling at my doorhandle, the 3rd I had never seen, and the 4th I thought I had seen standing by the truck. Anyways, they had me stay in my car and put each individual behind a police cruiser with a spotlight on for me to identify, and the kid that they pulled up first looked at me with this glare that screamed \"I should have just killed you when I had the chance\". The other 3 just looked scared, angry, and maybe (?) remorseful because they got caught.\n\nBeyond having just been faced with the possibility of being shot and killed, I am surrounded by about 15 police cars, all with lights on, and I already have (diagnosed) PTSD and one of my triggers is illuminated emergency lights. I am absolutely panicked and freaking out.\n\nAnyways, over the last few days, I have responded in the same ways I did when my car got stolen last month (when the carjacking was attempted, I was in a rental as my car was recovered and is currently in the body shop). I was just telling people things like, \"Wanna hear something traumatic? XD\" and \"You want to hear something awesome?!\" and then telling them what happened. I was a little bit more humored when my car got stolen and looked at it as positively as I could, with this, I still have played it off as casually as I can with some humor involved. I've had my friend over at my house since then, the same one I was waiting to pick up, and all I've done is try and put on a strong face and pretend it's okay. Every time a victim's advocate or DA or whoever calls me about what happened, I start to break down. I had a car's headlight flash through my curtains last night and I immediately feared for my life and started crying. I went out the day after the carjacking attempt and bought a gun with all my rent money, so I don't even have rent and I'm freaking out about that. I keep having flashbacks. I was curled up in bed with the blanket over my head crying and all I felt was shame for crying. I just want the flashbacks to go away, I feel bad for feeling traumatized. I keep telling myself that I'm better than this and that I shouldn't be crying and that shit happens.\n\nMy stepdad tells me it's my fault for sitting parked in a bad area of town when it was dark. I'm not saying I'm unappreciative of the concern of my friends for my physical safety, but nobody really cares what is going on mentally or emotionally except for the friend I've had over and my cousin. Everyone else has just assumed I would take it like a champ as I did with the car theft. I just keep trying to compartmentalize and forget and not feel. I'd rather feel numb than scared or depressed or whatever else. I don't know how I can even reconcile these feelings or justify to myself that it's okay to feel what I'm feeling.\n\nTo make things worse, the kid with the gun was FOURTEEN. He's literally in middle school. I sat in the preliminary hearing in court the day after the crime and asked for no bond and no contact (both granted) and I feel bad for wanting the worst for this kid for what he did to me. I feel even worse because his mom has no clue of the gravity of the situation (an immigrant from Africa and English is a second language) and kept saying in court \"he's a good kid\" and \"It's \\*just\\* a stolen car, nobody got hurt\". Like I feel awful because this is a kid, and seeing how his mom felt just makes me feel bad. The kid is already on probation and already has a record of gang activity, fraudulently obtaining a firearm, and theft. The defense was saying \"Well he's in school, he's a straight-A student, and keeping him in jail could severely affect his future and his progress in therapy and school.\" Like, I know they're paid to say that, and defend him, but like are you fucking kidding me??\n\nHow to I let myself be okay with what happened? Any tips for mot feeling guilty over how I feel?\n\nSide note: I can't do therapy because I don't have the upfront for therapy and the VC people say they only reimburse, so that's not an option either.\n\n\nTL:DR: I was a victim of violent crime, I keep having flashbacks, I'm depressed, crying, fearful of my life, etc. and I just feel ashamed for feeling that way. I feel worse because the perpetrator is only 14 and his mom doesn't understand how bad the situation was/is no matter how the judge tried to explain it and she's just confused. I'm upset with myself for wanting this kid to have the worst punishment possible, at 14, and I'd rather just forget about it all and not feel how I do. There's no way I can justify how I feel to myself. Does anybody have helpful tips on how to be okay with how I'm feeling? Also, therapy is not an option as I do not have the upfront for it and victim's comp will only reimburse me.\n\nedit: typo + clarification",

    "selftext": "For the past few weeks now, I've been watching tons of videos about trauma, psychology and inner child healing alongside practicing CBT on Bloom and with the advice my therapist has given me. I was doing meditations and mindful practices daily and got a lot of compliments on improvement in my mental health from my therapist, psychologist, friends and family. Skip to about three weeks later and my mental health completely dips a little while after I finally fully absorb that I never had a real childhood and all the trauma I've been and continue to go through and deal with. My patience, understanding, openness and motivation for life went from 100 to 0 real fast. I've lost all my libido (and I'm normally an extremely active person), I can't read or respond to any messages from my partner without feeling instant hatred and annoyance, I have zero motivation to work on my personal project (the thing that's kept my going for years), I'm getting addictive behavior (I have ARFID and struggle with chewing and spitting out food, I stopped for a while, recently I've been wasting a LOT of money on food and said food itself), I'm barely able to keep up with my Bloom and it feels like a chore. I could go on and on. I'm so stressed 24/7 as I pick up the toxic patterns around me in a household I can't escape. Is this normal? How can I move on from this? I want to go back to where I was when I first started really focusing on CBT. I honestly felt so much happier and more at peace and now I'm just exhausted all the time. I'm still doing meditations, daily breathing and writing mindfulness exercises every day, which has greatly helped my panic attacks, but I'd like my mood to be better as well.\n\nSome side notes: I am transmasc and take testosterone, just got off of birth control a few weeks ago. Not sure if that contributes to my libido loss at all. I do have major depressive disorder, but normally my depression episodes result in me being more sluggish than anything, but I've been able to go on walks and leave the house fairly well. Going to get evaluated for ASD soon and (I believe-- hopefully, since I highly suspect it) BPD as well if that means anything.",

I struggle with being hypersensitive to other peoples emotions because of my childhood. If I sense that my boyfriend is even remotely upset, I immediately freak out and try to fix it. Usually it's not a huge issue because my boyfriend is good at calming me down while reassuring me. However when we have longer arguments or discussions where he gets annoyed. I totally shut down and I am unable to talk or think. My boyfriend gets a bit frustrated sometimes, because he wants us to be able to have a discussion and be done with it within a reasonable time. Which I understand, because sometimes I start crying when he seems annoyed or upset and then it turns into a several hour thing where I just completely spiral into negative thoughts (blaming myself, being scared he is going to leave me etc.).

It would take me a very long time to calm down on my own since I have a tendency to escalate things in my head and 2.

I‚Äôm wondering if anyone has had the experience of leaving a high demand religion that they experienced trauma from and how they dealt with that. I‚Äôll explain:\n\nI (24m) was raised in an extremely religious house/community that takes chastity/purity very seriously. I didn‚Äôt lose my virginity until last year, and when I did, I immediately had a severe anxiety attack  afterwards and passed out, waking up sweating unstoppably. I had realized afterwards the risk of pregnancy (cause I wasn‚Äôt really using my brain in the moment) and the realization of that possibility fucked me up bad. I didn‚Äôt try having sex again for about 8 months, and just about every time I do (regardless of how much protection is involved) I get severe intrusive thoughts and feelings like I had the first time. \n\nAnyways last night I had sex with a girl I like and afterwards I basically had a flashback of the first time. I passed out, was sweating, didn‚Äôt get an hour of sleep, and had illogical racing thoughts about the whole situation. For example she was on birth control but that did nothing to soothe my mind. \n\nDoes anyone have advice on how to deal with trauma related to religion or cultural pressure?",

Someone can speak to me and I won‚Äôt really process what they‚Äôre saying, I can‚Äôt process words when reading either. It‚Äôs difficult to think logically and problem solving abilities go out the window. \n\nFor example, I‚Äôm a new waitress at a restaurant and dropped a tray full of plates the other day in front of everyone.

Hours later I‚Äôm flitting about the restaurant with no rhythm, rhyme or reason, walking one direction then changing my mind, turning around then changing my mind again, being awkward as fuck. So later on I start rolling silverware for no particular reason, and my trainer is explaining what to do for closing side work, suggesting that I get started on it now.

    "selftext": "(This is long sorry). \n\nI(25F) dated a girl(28), we‚Äôll call her A, for a year who was still stuck on her ex(28F) who was also her best friend. They had a fling in high school that her parents put an end to, but it remained ‚Äúunfinished business,‚Äù blah blah. Her ex started reaching out to her around the time we started dating.\n\nDespite what we labeled our relationship, in actuality, the ex was the girlfriend the entire time. She was the main priority, and the one she wanted the most. I was the ‚Äúgirlfriend,‚Äù but if anything came up, she‚Äôd drop me and go to see her on que. She‚Äôd drive over a hundred miles on a whim to go see her and be there for her. \nI thought to myself, nah, they‚Äôre best friends, the girl just needs emotional support. They both have PTSD and supported each other. I had suspicions that she was cheating on me but for some reason, I decided to trust her. She looked me in the eye and said she was not involved with anyone else, my naive self believed it. \n\nBut one day I couldn‚Äôt help it and went through her phone and read texts saying ‚ÄúI miss you already,‚Äù and ‚ÄúI can still smell you on me,‚Äù and her ex was saying ‚ÄúI still wish I could taste you,‚Äù etc. After reading this, I had a little breakdown for a moment and then I remember I suddenly shut off in the same way I did when I was 13, when I found out my Dad was in the hospital after having a heart attack. I started hysterically crying and then just shut down. Afterwards, I remember I acted pretty nonchalant while my Dad was having triple bypass surgery, and my Mom questioned me, insinuating I was heartless and cold. I also had a falling out with all my friends that year and my Dad had another binge drinking episode shortly after he got out of the hospital (he had been sober since I was 6, after his 2nd time in rehab). I was never really the same after that year. My personality changed, I became withdrawn and asocial and I haven‚Äôt come out of it since then. I still have no friends and isolate for the most part. I barely talk to anyone. A was the only exception. \n\nBut anyway, I allowed this. For over a year. I never told her I went through her phone, but I did almost break up with her and then she ended up dumping me for the summer. She tried to get back with me by Fall and I stupidly took her back. She still stayed on her bullshit, unsurprisingly, but I was chill, we coasted for a while until she ended up driving over to see her ex on our anniversary. That‚Äôs when I suddenly became emotional again and broke up with her for good. \n\nIt‚Äôs been 4 years now, and despite all of this, I don‚Äôt feel any anger for her. I never did. Only love. I‚Äôm not sure why. I hate myself plenty, though. I still have feelings, I still feel that I love her and think about her often. She was my best friend and we had a blast together. She‚Äôs the only person in my life that I ever had a mutual connection with.  \n\nSometimes I wonder if I‚Äôm in a dissociative state and don‚Äôt realize it. Maybe that could explain why I‚Äôve never been able to feel any anger towards her, and why I‚Äôm so asocial, hopelessly detached and under the radar, when I used to be a goofy, crazy kid.

    "selftext": "Don‚Äôt look for quick fixes. Instead, crave to learn tools that you can use and reuse your whole life to solve any problem you might encounter. Become bullet-proof.\n\nSometimes when we struggle, there‚Äôs the desire to be fixed by something, by someone, maybe a therapist, maybe a relationship, or even a higher power. We want our struggle to disappear together with our pain, so it is only normal to wish for such a thing. Even if this is not a realistic possibility and we know deep down that it is also not the best we can ask for. In these situations, rather than wishing to be fixed, we should search for the best guidelines and the most useful tools. Something that we can rely always rely on independently of our inner state or the situation we are in. Something that gives us power, rather than making us powerless and dependent on others. This means that when we seek help, we do it from a very different place and with a much healthier perspective.\n\nWe should look for guidance, for a way to proceed, we should aim to find our own path. Simultaneously, we should crave to learn the tools we need to follow it. In this way, we are able to put into place the right habits, mindsets, healing practices, and action plans. If we are blessed with some breakthroughs along the way, we embrace them but we don‚Äôt rely only on those.\n\nKeep in mind that most improvements occur in small cumulative steps that compound over time to lead to the desired results in the medium to long term. That‚Äôs how learning works, that‚Äôs how growing works: it takes time. We need enough time to learn, practice, and implement. More importantly, we need enough time for results to accumulate and have a far greater impact on our life than they would otherwise.\n\nIt is very important to discover all the pleasant things in life, such as what we really want and how to enjoy life to the fullest, but it is equally important to know how to proceed in hard times. We must know how to deal with anxiety on our own, how to face fears, how to keep pushing forwards during difficult times. We need to become bullet-proof. Therefore, we must focus on learning how to overcome problems, as well as on cultivating the qualities that might be lacking.\n\nBreakthroughs are fascinating moments in the process of transformation. Most of us have experienced eureka moments when a big change or realisation occurred and became permanent in our life from that moment on. We love these moments, they are amazing, but sometimes create the false idea that, if change doesn‚Äôt occur in that manner, it won‚Äôt happen at all. Of course, that is an erroneous and dangerous belief.\n\nFurthermore, we can be tempted to chase such moments and become demotivated if they do not occur. In the same way, if we look at other people and see big changes happening, we might incorrectly assume that, if we don‚Äôt change as fast as they do, we are unable to change. This is an equally dangerous line of thinking that can lead us to get forever stuck.\n\nBreakthroughs can be intoxicating and they are truly beautiful moments, so don‚Äôt take me wrong when I say that for me it is more meaningful to learn tools to overcome challenging moments in life and to develop them over time than to have sporadic big chances.\n\nThe reason why I prefer to develop tools and processes I can consistently rely on is that they allow me to truly become independent and to find more about who I really am as a person. I want to be able to change according to my own will, I want to experience true freedom and I want others to experience the same. In this way, we start seeing the principles behind the right practices and that is a bigger gift than a breakthrough. This means that our understanding expands and we get true power and control of our life and well-being.\n\nLet me give you an example to illustrate my point of view when it comes to the two processes of transformation: the fast one, through breakthroughs, and the slow one, through small cumulative steps taken daily. Let‚Äôs say someone is experiencing high levels of anxiety (like I used until a few years ago) and is not capable of dealing with it. The anxiety is overwhelming and might even be a permanent state experienced from the moment of waking up until the moment of going to sleep. On top of that, there might be especially triggering situations, like public speaking or a particular relationship, that cause extra stress, which can lead to a state close to a full-on panic attack.\n\nNow there are 2 options to consider. The first one is the fast route where we can follow a guided exercise that lowers the state of anxiety immediately. The level of anxiety might lower so much that we might experience a peaceful state like never before. In such moments, there is a huge relief that often comes with the feeling of ‚ÄúI am finally breathing freely‚Äù. Moments like this are very inspiring, they fuel hope and leave a strong mark in the mind: ‚Äúthis state of calmness and bliss is possible for me too‚Äù. This is all great except for a tiny problem. As soon as we leave the safe environment where we had that experience, there is a tendency to progressively shift away from that peaceful state and sooner or later we will find ourselves close to the initial state of anxiety, not knowing exactly what to do.\n\nThe second option is to learn how to progressively overcome anxiety in a step-by-step process that can be practiced at home, as well as in real-life scenarios, maybe even while being triggered. This option is not as sexy, I admit. There is no immediate result or memorable initial experience. In fact, at the surface, it seems that we only have a set of instructions to follow. Although the initial sense of relief might not be there, there is something much more valuable: knowing what to do when anxiety strikes, knowing how to practice and develop your own ability to deal with anxiety, and how to eventually overcome it. In the beginning, you might not consciously know it but now there‚Äôs a new possibility, there‚Äôs a way to gain control and have power over a situation that before was out of control.\n\nNow there are a couple of questions. Which of these approaches is the best? Which one should we follow? My perspective is: both! I prefer to take advantage of all the tools and possibilities that are available at any specific moment. In practical terms, it means that I believe that any professional help from a therapist, coach, mentor, or teacher should lead to breakthrough-like moments but it should not stop there. There should be practices and exercises to be done daily in the comfort of anyone‚Äôs home. Furthermore, these exercises should be useful in real-life scenarios, facing the challenging triggers that happen in normal life with all its unpredictabilities and discomforts.\n\nI strongly believe that the most effective tools are the ones that can be used in 3 different environments: during a session with a professional; in the comfort of our own home; and in real-life scenarios. There are exceptions, of course, but one should always strive to extend the use of a certain tool as much as possible, as long as it is effective. That, not only allows us to understand the core principles of its effectiveness but also allows us to progress much faster.\n\nI hope this post can help you in your journey. Keep creating powerful breakthroughs and implementing the most effective step-by-step practices.",

    "selftext": "Med student here(it's undergraduate in my country, so I have no degree). 2 years ago, I decided to skip an exam and take it in the fall(I was extremely stressed at that time, no reason to go into details). My school only offers 2 chances, but I was sure there wouldn't be a problem-I started studying 3 months in advance, several hours a day, got a student buddy in the same situation, the works. I was dreaming the material. The exam was going to be in a clinical case format.\n\nAnd the professor decided to make a clinical case out of an illness that wasn't in the material. I know it sounds like I'm lying to cover my failure-I'm not. That's exactly what happened.\n\nWhat followed was the most horrible experience of my life. They made me repeat the year. One year of waking up at 6 to go to the hospital, of studying and passing exams, down the drain. One year of pay, down the drain. Another year of tuition, down the drain. A job that I was very much looking forward to-stupidly delayed by a year.\n\nFirst came a horrible survival anxiety. Jobs are a way to keep yourself fed and sheltered. I (indirectly) failed at getting a job while doing everything in my power to help myself. I worried about ending up on the streets. I worried about ending up trafficked. Worst of all, I worried about never being able to break from my toxic family. While I was in the hospital, retaking what I failed, I talked to a patient who lost a finger in a work accident. I felt\" Will this happen to me too, if I don't manage to get a white collar job? The lack of control I felt was also bad-I got to the point where images came in my head of someone gouging my eyes out-that professor hurt me and I had no way to stop him, won't other people do the same?\n\nThankfully, I was able to(partially) solve the financial part. There is still an incredible amount of shame, frustration at myself and at the situation, anger, etc. √è feel like avoiding the friends who know about the experience and feel bad about keeping the truth about what happened from the friends that don't know.\n\nWorst of all, the specialty I want to do-Psychiatry- was semi ruined by the experience. Things that I loved before-interning, doing research, attending lectures are now filled with the frustration that I'm being kept from it. I feel like a dancer whose leg has been cut off.\n\nAlso, the experience of being behind a year will almost never finish-even 6 years from now, I'll be a 4thyear intern when I should have been a 5th(different responsibilities and pay). I'll be an intern when I should have been a specialist, etc. I also feel like I'll never stop THINKING about it-that it will come up on vacations, on my wedding day, when my kids will be born.\n\nThing is, I'm going to therapy and it's actually very helpful. But I'm still very angry at this complete mess that could have been avoided if that professor had simply provided complete materials. I really, really want to take revenge and also know I can't actually do anything-especially not anything that could compare to what I've been through.\n\nI don't want to sound spoiled, but it's genuinely the worst pain I've felt in my life.",

    "selftext": "I need so badly to talk about this and this seems like the safest place. \n\nTwo weeks ago, I (21F) was at the baptist church I work for as a pianist early in the morning rehearsing, when the pastor came in and told us that there were shots heard behind the church two minutes prior and that we were on lockdown. I was freaked out, but couldn't show it because my boss had me and the singers go right back to practicing as if nothing had just been said. I couldn't focus for the rest of the rehearsal. As soon as we finished rehearsing (about an hour before the service), I tried to leave to \"go get breakfast\" (aka I was desperate to go home and see my boyfriend and feel safe), but they wouldn't let me out for safety purposes. I then sat in the pastor's wife's office watching SNL and trying to cheer up, knowing full well that the doors were locked and there was a shooter on the loose. I was so frightened to go back into the sanctuary for the service. I remember looking towards the back every second I could and sitting in the pew thinking about how I should react should the shooter come in from this door vs that door. We were in an active shooter situation for almost two and a half hours when the service ended and the pastor told us that the suspect had been found and we were safe to leave. \n\nI have to go back in tomorrow for the first time since the incident and I'm scared as shit. The church is right next to a bad neighborhood, and I know this situation could easily happen again. I'm on a yearly contract that I'm only halfway through, so I can't leave. Even worse, my boss keeps wanting me at the church easter and earlier on Sundays to rehearse, although I obviously want to be there for the least amount of time possible so there's less of a chance of a shooting while I'm there.\n\nBut the worst part of all of this was how everybody else acted. They all just kept going on as if nothing was happening. The pastor referred to it as \"a bit of excitement\" during the service. I'm sure they were scared on the inside, but they seemed so calm and brave and were only worried about the Sunday school kids being safe.\n\nI'm 21 (much much younger than everybody else who works there), and I just felt like the most scared little kid that day, knowing that I'm considered an adult and I would have to fend for myself should anything happen, as opposed to those kids. I honest to God felt jealous on top of scared.\n\nI feel so much more comfortable posting here than talking about it with others. I even felt insanely anxious when I told my mom about it because I didn't want to worry her when she's already in a really rough mental health place right now.\n\nI just don't know how to walk in there tomorrow without panicking. I have to be there at the same time I was there that day. I'm sure it'll get easier, but what if it doesn't? Or what if this happens again? The incident was barely covered in the news, so maybe this happens too often to warrant any concern? I just need comfort and advice and any help possible.",

Kept telling herself that it's her fault (\"I shouldn't have moved\" or \"I shouldn't have gone to golf\") and stuff like that.\n\nTried reassuring and helping her \"speedrun\" the 5 stages of grief, and tried calming her down as well.\n\nI might need a bit of help here, any tips on how to cope with these kinds of stuff? I'm asking for her of course.\n\nCheers,\n\nAbsolution64 with a bonk on his head",

    "selftext": "My dad is emotionally abusive and has been since I was in middle school (now 19 and in college). He‚Äôs been toxic to everyone in the family from teaching my mom phrases like ‚Äúit takes two to argue‚Äù (usually between him starting it and playing the victim) to me waking up at 2am to see him in my room on my computer looking through its history.\nI only started to get professional help for my mental health after I had a mental breakdown in the last half of highschool that climaxed into me forgetting two weeks (and to top it off no one noticed the whole time). Since then I‚Äôve struggled with dissociating but being away from my dad in addition to switching to a supportive college counselor for my mental health has been very enlightening.\nI thought the ‚Äòmissing‚Äô 2 weeks was the most recent and uncontrollable experience in dissociating but I was warned that dissociating usually happens after significant trauma‚Äî that dissociating along with my potential for memory loss could be covering up forgotten trauma from even farther back.\nTurns out I‚Äôve forgotten things from as recent as Fall 2019 as my highschool buddy brought up that my dad tried to force me to sign a contract giving him full access to my technology including passwords. (it wasn‚Äôt legally binding but as a kid in the closet knowing I wasn‚Äôt straight and doubting I was cis I knew my home life could turn considerably less safe very easily‚Äî so this ordeal of him holding it over my head induced several panic attacks). It was very strange hearing of something that had happened to me, with my brain jumping around a bit trying to reason it out by thinking it might have been from long ago or something I didn‚Äôt bring up had happened. Nope. My dad just forgot to hold it over me eventually so my brain repressed the ordeal.\nTo top it off for the past month or two my mom and my (older) sister have both been pushing me to spend time around my dad (who‚Äôs still toxic as shit) in order to let him prove that he‚Äôs changed enough for me to forgive him.\nI‚Äôm the youngest of four kids. I had to stay around his abusive side for longer than most of my siblings.\nI hate thinking that even more things could be right around the corner of my brain and I just haven‚Äôt remembered them yet. I fully intend to cut him off, but they keep pushing and insisting he‚Äôs trying.\nI know when he‚Äôs comfortable enough he‚Äôll go back. Because for years I tried explaining every step of everything to him‚Äî trying to explain mental health and how he was being toxic. Trying to get him to change at all was always temporary. I just hope he doesn‚Äôt turn my mom and sister against me, because I don‚Äôt know what the hell to do.\n\nTL;DR; My dad has narcissistic tendencies and has been emotionally abusive for years. Now as I realize I‚Äôm still having memory trouble from dissociating and symptoms of ptsd my sister and mom are pushing me to spend time around him so I can see he‚Äôs trying to be different. I want to cut him off when I‚Äôm able.",

    "title": "EMDR and CPTSD: Some Basic Terms, Concepts, and Techniques",
    "selftext": "**Part 1: Structures of Trauma**\n\n[**Part 2: Safety and Resourcing**](https://www.reddit.com/r/traumatoolbox/comments/12wu0u3/emdr_introduction_to_safety_and_resourcing/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI started EMDR a few years ago, and it's helped a lot. I'd like to make a few posts about the stuff I've learned in case it helps anyone else.\n\nThis won't be a guide on how to *do* EMDR, and it certainly won't be comprehensive or perfect, but I'm hoping to provide a free and (hopefully?) somewhat reader-friendly introduction to some common terminology and concepts.\n\nI won't be able to cover everything I want to focus on in one post, so I'll likely be writing a series of them when I have time.\n\nTo start, in this post, I want to map out some of the basic structures of trauma. Different aspects need different approaches, and processing can get blocked (or worse) if you can't identify and work with the different elements effectively.\n\nMy personal, *very* simplified cheat-sheet breakdown of basic categories looks something like this:\n\nTwo basic types of original damage:\n\n**-Traumas of Commission**\n\n**-Traumas of Omission**\n\nVarious strategies for containing and managing traumatic memory material:\n\n**-Defenses, copes, etc.**\n\nAnd all of the aforementioned happening in the context of:\n\n**-Structural Dissociation**\n\nAgain, this is very simplified. Practitioners Gonzalez & Masquera coined the catch-all term **dysfunctionally stored information (DSI)**, which includes both the aforementioned defenses and structural dissociation, but also highlights the fact that many target-worthy phenomenon and experiences arise from the long-term effects of a person attempting to navigate life while dealing with all of this. Consequently, trauma tends to become larger and more complex over time, and the first necessary targets for processing in the context of CPTSD are not always (or even typically) going to be discrete ‚Äúexteroceptive‚Äù memories (that is, trauma-related experiences prompted by purely external factors).\n\nHowever, I'd like to keep this simple for now, so I'll be sticking to the basic terms listed. Just keep in mind that the interplay between these basic elements and ongoing lived experiences can make things very tangled and complicated.\n\n**Traumas of Commission & Traumas of Omission**\n\nTraumas of commission are what a lot of people probably think of first when they hear the word ‚Äútrauma.‚Äù This is the bad stuff that happens. The abuse, the horrific accidents and losses, etc.\n\nTraumas of Omission are the good and necessary stuff which needed to happen, but did not.\n\nIt's not a perfect metaphor, but I might consider traumas of commission as being a bit like bad things happening to a house-- fire, flooding, etc. On the other hand, traumas of omission when experienced during formative development can be a bit like if someone tried to build that house on top of a sinkhole. What's not there is as important as what is. I think it's generally safe to assume that anyone with CPTSD is dealing with some combination of both. Significant traumas of omission can not be counted on to resolve spontaneously during processing, and neither can traumas of commission in the context of significant traumas of omission, so this gets us into the realm of advanced **resourcing, interweaves,** and other interventions focused on filling in and repairing what's missing.\n\n**Defenses**\n\nNext there's all of the strategies which the brain uses in an attempt to keep the traumatic material quarantined and manageable. This gets us into the realm of overlapping terms and concepts such as **defenses, dissociative phobias,** and **affect phobias.** I'll be using the term ‚Äúdefense‚Äù here.\n\nYou may have heard the phrase ‚Äúthe past is present‚Äù in the context of trauma. When active, unprocessed traumatic material plays out as a visceral re-experiencing of at least some elements of the traumatic experiences. Being trapped in this state perpetually could make any level of normal functioning quite impossible, so for the sake of survival the brain attempts to use various strategies to keep those states quarantined and avoid things which might activate them. Unfortunately, these strategies themselves can be quite limiting and energy-intensive. Even when effective, a person can find themselves seriously encumbered in day-to-day life from needing to maintain them.\n\nFurther, as tangentially alluded to earlier, established defenses can play a role in the formation of new traumatic material if they automatically block aspects of ongoing difficult experiences & shunt them into isolated clusters of unprocessed memory.\n\nThe interplay between a person and their defenses can also create new negative experiences and conflicts internally (such as the frequent shame and self-loathing experienced by some people over various addictions) creating yet more damage to resolve.\n\nAt the same time, unlike the damage itself, defenses involve positive affect because they provide relief. Even if a person does not like the defenses they have or the effect those defensive strategies have on their life, the relief they provide can make them irresistible in the moment. Virtually anything can serve as a defense. Avoidance is the most basic and universal, since all defenses involve the avoidance of something. Idealization is another common defense, and addictions of various kinds often serve as a defense as well.\n\nVery often, defenses kick in before a person even consciously registers a trigger. Defenses may break down or be overwhelmed due to life circumstances, but well-functioning defenses can block all awareness of trauma for extended periods of time.\n\nAttempting to access traumatic material with an approach like EMDR can activate these defensive strategies, making it impossible to access and process the relevant traumatic material. Alternatively, it can bring too many of those defenses down too quickly, leaving a person flooded with far more traumatic material than is manageable at one time. This is *very much* not a good or healthy state to be in, so defenses need to be handled very carefully and respectfully.\n\n**Structural Dissociation**\n\nFinally, we've got all of this happening in the context of **structural dissociation**. Although often viewed as a defensive structure in its own right, this phenomenon very much deserves its own category.\n\nThere is a vast range of experiences here, and it's a somewhat contentious topic. Also, I must admit that I personally have yet to find any single theory on the origin and nature of structural dissociation entirely satisfying in regards to my own experiences. I consider them somewhat of a work in progress. That said, when present to any significant degree, I can not over-stress how sanity-saving it is to have some kind of workable framework for recognizing, navigating, and working with structural dissociation. Even in its milder forms, conflicts between parts or the isolated nature of any given part can at the very least make directly processing traumatic material impossible without some targeted intervention.\n\nDissociated parts can contain their own memory material, maintain their own defensive strategies around that material, and also involve yet more defenses maintained between themselves and other parts in a system, with each part having its own conflicting perspectives and priorities. Like previously mentioned in relation to defenses, internal drama and conflict between parts can also create new layers of damage and block the processing of ongoing difficult experiences.\n\nFurther, because of their separation, various parts are also likely unable to initially access good and helpful material which is only present in other parts. When active in the present, they may be unable to connect to or even remember information and positive resources which are not part of their own experience. It's also common for people with significant structural dissociation to be unaware of it. Because of this, and because any part of an internal system may be activated at any time during processing, this can cause some major complications depending on the state & level of communication and cooperation present within any internal system.\n\nA full breakdown and review of the relevant theories is outside my scope, but I want to at least introduce some basic terms from the two most common theories of structural dissociation which I've encountered, the **theory of structural dissociation (TSDP)** and **Internal Family Systems (IFS).** Both theories categorize dissociated parts by type, with each type having its own basic nature, needs, and specific interventions.\n\nFrom the theory of structural dissociation (TSDP), you'll encounter the terms **Apparently Normal Part (ANP)** and **Emotional Part (EP)**. Practitioners working from this theory also sometimes use the terms **Defensive Part** and **Introject Part.**\n\nFrom texts based on Internal Family Systems (IFS) you'll encounter the terms **Manager, Exile,** and **Firefighter.**\n\nANPs loosely correlate to managers, EPs to exiles, and defensive parts to firefighters.\n\nIntrojects are parts internally modeled based on perceptions of influential figures and caretakers, usually from early life.\n\nTSDP further categorizes the level of structural dissociation present in a person as primary (one ANP, one EP), Secondary (one ANP, multiple EPs) or tertiary (multiple ANPs and EPs).\n\nI'm not going to try and get any further in-depth here, but I will say that I have lifted perspectives and techniques from both sets of literature with good results. Entirely satisfying or not, practitioners using either or both theories have created a lot of good and usable material and insight.\n\n**Endnote**\n\nI'm going to stop here for today. Again, this is very simplified, not comprehensive, and reflects only my own understanding of the subject material. I hope someone finds something useful in it, if only a decent set of terms and ways to phrase questions for their own research.\n\nThese elements, taken altogether in the context of someone who's potentially spent decades attempting to navigate life while maintaining all of this & acquiring new damage along the way, can turn a person's internal landscape into quite a complicated minefield.\n\nOne of the main challenges in EMDR, especially in the context of CPTSD, is to access and process manageable bits of the damage without becoming too destabilized along the way. Unlike the ‚Äúfirst or worst‚Äù approach to targeting used in standard EMDR for relatively simple PTSD, this often involves beginning with more tangential targets such as defenses and other secondary trauma structures.\n\nI want to get more in-depth on ways of doing that in later posts. I think I'll tackle some basic safety and resourcing next time, and continue on from there.",

    "selftext": "I grew up alone with my younger sister, with my severely bipolar mom. During her depressive episodes, it was important that no one knew about these catastrophic conditions at home. Mom was drugged up and spent weeks at a time in bed. How did I deal with it? I didn't. I didn't feel anything. It was important that I didn't fall apart, so I could be there for my little sister. I had school, and in the afternoons I played computer games. No emotions, whether it was because Mom was gone for another day and no one knew if she was alive or if she collapsed due to circulation problems from the pills and hit her head on the heater - no emotions. My body thought it was wiser to freeze the emerging emotions directly into an ice cube. Where these ice cubes are exactly, I don't know, but somewhere in my body. It used to make sense, because it allowed me to function for a long time, until I couldn't take it anymore at 16 years old and left our small family. It was somehow a liberation, but the ice cube machine remains. If I enter into new relationships in life today at 28 years old, or if I hear from my mother that she is back in bed at home: don't feel too much, better freeze it! Life is very exhausting because so much is frozen in my body that it has become heavy and tired. But there is still hope somehow, because when I type these lines, a few tears flow. I believe these are old ice cubes that have just melted and are now flowing out of my eyes.",

I have learned a hard lesson that you cannot help someone else, when they don't want to change and you cannot just make up and be friendly with everyone.\n\nThe thing I have noticed lately is that I distract myself more from my feelings. It's like feeling my feelings is too painful, so I do all these activities to not think about this person. I feel beyond betrayed and humiliated and was told my feelings weren't valid.\n\nThe trauma is sexual as well, as I was used as an empty vessel for sexual desires, while at the same time they didn't respect me as a person in any sense. I felt like a sex doll, a so-called \"dumb blonde\" like Marilyn Monroe, who was also intelligent yet only lusted after. I really feel uncomfortable when people obsess over my body and ignore all the rest. It's like there isn't any connection there. It's so... beastly: like, fuck your personality but show me that ass, you know. I struggle to disconnect my sexuality fully from this person and I need to do that to heal.\n\nDoes anyone have some helpful resources on how to become open to love and learning to trust others again? Or to rediscover your sexual side after trauma?",

I think this is partly because I dont like to think of myself or others as helpless victims. I also understand that there are way worse things than some joke.\n\nI seem to value trust more than the average person and I find most people untrustworthy.\n\nI feel that most people (at least in developed western countries, which are the ones I know) have a very naive mentality and are in a permanent state of infantilism. They kinda live in their own bubble unaware of how the real world works and of the violence and risks that exist outside of the lifestyle they are used to. If you take them out of their comfort zone most of their assessments are likely to be wrong, something that I find extremely off-putting.

Long story short, I was riding an electric scooter, car was about to turn the corner, I hit the brakes too hard and I fell off, feeling a pop in my knee. While my physical healing has been going quite well, getting surgery over six months ago and now walking, I realised that I am now more easily frightened whenever I'm in cars. No matter who's driving, I'm scared whenever a sudden movement is made, a car comes out of nowhere or when I think about a crash. I wouldn't know what to do if I ever do get into a crash. \n\nHowever, I only thought this startle/fear response applied to me being in cars. I love seeing, hearing and being near to fireworks so I was excited to see them ring in the new year from a family friend's house. But then I noticed that every time a firework went off near me, I bristle up. Like if someone came up behind me to scare me and I didn't know. Every time. It felt like I wanted to run away. I thought it was really strange because it was happening in the presence of something I love. I talked to my therapist about it (if it applies, I have a diagnosed gen. anxiety disorder and high functioning autism) and she said it could be a trauma response. So I just wanted to know if anyone else experienced becoming more jumpy and scared in their day-to-day life and how they cope with it.",

    "title": "Chronic Trauma from heavy bullying in middle school and high school (advice)",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone, first time posting here. I am currently 25 (m). Throughout middle school and high school, I was bullied pretty intensely. It involved primarily mental tormentation and physical.  however, at times there was sexual abuse. When I was in high school in freshman year, I became apart of a group of pretty toxic masculine boys. I thought they were cool and had a heavy desire to fit in. I soon became their emotional and physical punching bag. When we were all together it was like mob mentality they would gang up on me and hurt me physically, sexually and torment me mentally. however when I was 1on1 with one of them they would be really nice. I don't know why I continued to stay with this group, it's almost like Stockholm syndrome. \n\nThe 6 years of bullying have led me to have some symptoms that can be related to trauma such as if a male comes close to me I kind of cover my hands with my chest. (The bullies in the past would regularly attack my chest area). Also sometimes when my girlfriend touches me on my leg or arm I panic and freeze.  This past year, I did a trauma test and my therapist told me that it's likely that I have chronic trauma from the years of bullying. This revelation has helped me learn a lot about why I act in certain ways especially the amount of negative self-talk I have against myself. However, at times it's very hard to accept what they have done to me. I no longer consider them my friends however they believe that I am still theirs. They at times will message me to see how I'm doing or to hang out however this has only triggered me and causes me to spiral. \n\nI guess why I'm typing this is I want to get some advice on whether or not I should tell these Bullies (friends) that their bullying contributed to my trauma. Sometimes I feel like I just have to radically accept that it is what it is and I should just move on. At other times I feel like they should know the horrible negative impact they had on me and they should know the damage they caused. but would it make any difference.  I really don't know \n\nThanks for reading this long post . Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",

    "title": "How to stop judging yourself - become more aware of your thoughts and ask yourself if they're really true",
    "selftext": "Have you ever remembered something embarrassing that you‚Äôve done and thought ‚Äúyou idiot‚Äù? Or worse? Everyone does to some extent - its very ingrained in us to regret things from the past, to see ourselves as not meeting some standard and as a result we feel miserable and anxious. Its hard to stop your inner critic focusing his or her attention on you. It might be around your job performance, how you look or how you interact with other people.\n\nLearning to practice non-judgement can, over time, make a huge difference. The first step is training your mind to be aware of your mind, of your thoughts. Practicing awareness through a little bit of meditation every day will help you to tune in to the stream of thoughts passing in and out of your consciousness.\n\nNext is knowing what to do when you realise you're having judgemental thoughts about yourself. We probably feel sad, anxious or angry at ourselves and we might try and push the thought away. But to get our inner critic to relax, what we really need to do is to listen. Listen to what its saying and ask yourself whether it‚Äôs true. If it was happening to a friend, what would you say to them? You‚Äôd probably comfort and reassure them - you should be as kind to yourself. Take a step backwards out of the storm, breathe and observe. Observe the criticism without reacting. Notice what feelings you have associated with the criticism without being swept away. Accept the critical thought without agreeing, just noticing that it‚Äôs there.\n\nFinally I would invite you to look deeply into where the self judging comes from; the origin probably isn‚Äôt whatever perceived mistake you‚Äôre berating yourself for. What really drives your self criticism in this context? It might be an attachment to some past pain, something that happened in your childhood, it might be a relationship where you learned the habit, it might be something in your culture or a specific belief about yourself. We can be afraid to lift up the stone because of all the creepy crawlies that might come out but it‚Äôs the only way to truly liberate yourself from suffering.\n\n[Listen On Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/how-to-stop-judging-yourself-non-judgement-part-1/id1493806566?i=1000508877402)\n\n[Listen On Google Podcasts](https://www.google.com/podcasts?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9hbmNob3IuZm0vcy8xMjNkZThlMC9wb2RjYXN0L3Jzcw==)\n\n[Listen On Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/1ozwIEgzEtHQezPoi83nVV)\n\n[Other ways to listen](https://anchor.fm/shaun-donaghy/episodes/How-to-stop-judging-yourself-non-judgement-part-1-eqbnfb)",

    "selftext": "So I‚Äôm a long time out from my trauma event but it still is having quite the effect. I apologize for being blunt, but the event was that I was raped when I was six years old. I never told anyone at the time. I didn‚Äôt tell a soul until I was 22. The abuser has not been a part of my life since I was that age. I don‚Äôt know if it was a single incident or multiple. \n\nI am now 27 and I am in a much better place. I‚Äôve come to accept the effects on myself and have learned to accommodate my triggers or overcome them. Those most important people in my life know the truth, except for my parents. \n\nI didn‚Äôt tell my parents at the time because my abuser threatened to kill them if I told. By the time we had moved away I couldn‚Äôt bear to bring it up and was settling in to a long bout of denial. In affect, I started to protect my parents and it became an almost obsessive need to protect them from any trouble that I could. If I couldn‚Äôt I would blame myself. \n\nI still protect them and ‚Äòparent‚Äô them as it is a role that has been forced upon me due to their health and circumstances. Emotionally though I haven‚Äôt been dependent on them since I was six.   I‚Äôve been the care giver for my mother experiencing debilitating pain that was enough to make her scream without medication. I had to deny her medication when she was in danger of overdosing as the pain came back before she could have another dose. I have had to council my father through receiving a donor organ while off his bipolar medication. There are more minor incidents beyond counting. As you might imagine this has created a difficult  relationship. \n\nI‚Äôm not trying to blame my parents. I am and always have been an exceptional liar and actress and, especially with the extreme stress they were under at the time, they had no way of knowing. A part of me does feel resentment but I know it isn‚Äôt fair and it doesn‚Äôt have a lot of pull in me. \n\nMy problem now is that I feel this gulf with my parents that I don‚Äôt know how to bridge. In the past couple of years I have let more of my true emotions show and it has caused difficulties to say the least. They tended to believe me when I said everything was fine. They are trying though and doing as well as they can, I believe. \n\nI know though that my father is too mentally fragile to take the truth. I‚Äôm not exaggerating. When he learned that two of his younger siblings had been molested by the older a few year back it nearly destroyed him with the guilt of not stopping it. I honestly don‚Äôt think he could handle the truth from me and I don‚Äôt believe my mother could keep it secret from him. \n\nDoes anyone else have a similar issue? Are there people in your life that you can‚Äôt share your trauma with but still want to have a strong relationship with? I love my parents and they are good people. I want to be open with them and them with me, but I honestly believe I would bring them too much harm if I told them about this 21 years after the fact. How do I heal our relationship without telling?",

He tried to contact me the next day and carry out a normal conversation as if nothing happened but my friend helped me block him on Facebook so that he would not contact me in such a manner. Because of our longstanding friendship I thought maybe he also did not know what he did because he was drunk but he confided in a mutual friend and it was clear he was very aware of what he has done. He told our mutual friend he was afraid of reaching out because he was afraid of \"triggering\" me which is funny that he seems to care so much about my well-being now when he didn't seem to care so much about how I felt when he groped me. I am angry because I can't believe a friend I've known since high school would do this to me but even more shocked that he won't apologize to me given that he seemed okay with messaging me the next day to initiate normal convos. \n\nShould I confront him and ask him to apologize to me? I honestly don't know why but I just want him to acknowledge the situation and somehow feel like it may help me move on but I'm not sure. What should I do?\n\nTLDR: Long time friend assaulted me and has not apologized since the incident. Would it be bad to reach out to ask him to apologize?",

    "selftext": "Hey all. I wanted to share this article from [tinybuddha.com](https://tinybuddha.com/blog/how-to-reap-the-benefits-of-post-traumatic-growth/) about the benefits of post-traumatic growth, which occurs in some people after a traumatic experience in their life.\n\nThe five benefits mentioned are: Relating to Others, Appreciation of Life, New Possibilities, Personal Strength, and Spiritual Change.\n\nMy favourite is: **Appreciation of Life**\n\n>*Awareness and gratitude for what we have, focus on beauty and goodness, living with more presence and intention; the absence of taking things for granted.*\n\nIf we experience a distressing event in our lives, but it causes us to appreciate the good in our lives even more, was it really a bad event after all? Even someone who has a near death experience may look back and not regret what happened if it causes them to embrace life even more than they would have done otherwise. Do not underestimate the importance and power of perspective.\n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî  \n[Click here for more articles](https://www.reddit.com/r/MindOverMatterScott/search?q=flair_name%3A%22Article%22&restrict_sr=1)",

I started dissociating to the point that I felt no control over myself.  I did and still do get so confused thinking about it.  No one in my family believed what I had done and downplayed my worries...so didn't seek any help. \n\nTwo years later I'm still recovering, going to the chiropractor.

My family basically looked at me like I'm a psych patient following the injury as my mental health declined further. And even though I know I'm  making head way and slowly starting to learn to cope, I wish just one person would believe me. im having trouble accepting my life after all this.

    "title": "Traumatic Trust Issues: Just opened up a little bit to a family member and now I feel genuinely ill.",
    "selftext": "So I'm the youngest of my family, by quite a bit. I've always felt kind of the odd one out, neglected and not taken seriously. I usually keep things to myself in fear that I will just be ridiculed for my opinion and not taken seriously (which did happen, a lot in my childhood). Growing up my sibling that i lived with was pretty mean to me and neglected me quite a bit, I grew up thinking she hated me because of who I was not bc she was just mean. In my adolesence I had quite a few problems with friends and trust. My first girlfriend that i had a crush on and got attached to for all of high school treated me like shit and I felt worthless for awhile until a got counselling. 1 year later after moving on with counselling, I tried to be vulnerable with my feelings and push myself with courage to flirt etc. Evidentally I found out my closest friends were laughing at me behind my back because of things I said to her that were corny/cringey, that hurt a lot because I trying really hard to push myself and it was all for nothing. Not to mention the trust I had in those guys was effectively lost entirely. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBecause of all this and many other reasons I don't want to bore you with, I've become extremely closed off and have no trust in anybody. I'm still happy and sociable, but I don't let anybody in. If they leave me for whatever reason, I don't get upset whatsoever because I never let myself get attached to anyone at all (like my first gf). Nobody really knows how I feel about the way my family thinks of me (insignificant, neglected and always just the little bro). I just internalised all of this and learned to live with it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was talking to a sibling about family drama and my involvement (or lack thereof) in it. I'm usually just an observer and they asked what i thought of the drama in question. I told them I didn't think anything because I don't have a place in it. They pryed a little more and I said it's because I don't think anything I say will have any sort of significance.\n\nThey didn't fully understand and i felt i was in too deep and they were extremely confused, I opened up a bit saying how I feel like im not taken seriously, I'm always seen as the little brother who doesn't really know what he's talking about. I'm the innocent one and everyone sort of leaves me alone when it comes to adult things, (even tho im basically 20). I told them how I don't let people in because of my trust issues and I don't get attached, this means I don't really have any feelings about anything. \n\nThis was the first proper time i had told somebody how i feel about my family, even if it was only 20% of it. Now I feel genuinely sick. I'm worried about what they will say to the other family members because they will all get concerned about me. \"Do you really feel this way?\"  \"Why?\" \"Tell me?\" Sure. I could explain it, but they would never understand me. Not to mention it's extremely hard for me to be vulnerable with all my trauma and I always get afraid of letting people know how I feel.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel as though in writing the sevreity of my trauma is not fully realised, but I promise it affects me on a day to day life and it is real. Really why I'm posting is because I'm wondering how other people with trust and opening up trauma deal when it comes to opening up.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry this is so long, there is more to my trauma that would fill in some blanks and make this more coherent, but this would be many more paragraphs long.",

    "selftext": "Christmas driving - i started listening to Trauma-sensitive Mindfulness by David Treleaven \nhttps://www.davidtreleaven.com/book/\n\nThis book explains why i have strugggled with mindfulness and meditation over the years. Why zen Buddhism was a good fit (predictability, shorter sit times, not so much guided) and why being the bell ringer was a saviour. \n\nIt also explained the moment a teacher looked at me whilst on retreat and said \"i don't know how it can be so hard?\" \n\nThe book also has practical tips for counsellors etc to give trauma informed advice around mindfulness, which is good for everyone i think. So I'm recommending this for all those I know in the field, at least to skim through and check out the practical advice. \n\nThere are **massive** trigger warnings to anyone with ptsd tho. Please be aware that there are personal stories and they can be difficult. I skipped to the action steps alot and have involved my therapist. \n\nThis is a scientifically reputable book. I checked the sources. I feel safe recommending this. Sending everyone care and kindness for their journey. \n\n\"Drawing on a decade of research and clinical experience, educator and trauma professional David Treleaven shows that mindfulness meditation‚Äïpracticed without an awareness of trauma‚Äïcan exacerbate symptoms of traumatic stress. Instructed to pay close, sustained attention to their inner world, survivors can experience flashbacks, dissociation, and even retraumatization.\nThis raises a crucial question for mindfulness teachers, trauma professionals, and survivors everywhere: How can we minimize the potential dangers of mindfulness for survivors while leveraging its powerful benefits?\"\n\nTL; Dr mindful practices can be hard with ptsd. Get help around this. Be safe but don't give up the benefits are good. ",

Coward took himself out too. \n\nMy job was at a very small office, everyone worked in very close proximity so it didn't take much time for you to get close to others. I wouldn't say I was particularly close to her, but we did text here and there and from the beginning I felt myself very drawn to her. She reminded me of one of my own friends, whom I love very much, so this created in me a soft spot for her. \n\nBefore the tragedy and before I left, there had been small incidents that should have been red flags to me and to others that something was very wrong at home. She had severe mood swings, sometimes she'd come in with puffy eyes and not say a thing to anyone. People that had known her for a while (there at work)  would say that she was like that, that she was insecure and would get offended easily, to watch what I said around her. I never experienced anything like that with her, and as a matter of fact the reason we started texting was because I'd check in on her. I had a hunch she was probably just going through life, like so many of us. The day I left I gave her a hug and I told her to keep in touch, she said she would. \n\nThree weeks later I found out, their bodies where found two days later after being deceased from üî´ wounds.

That he never happened. Until years later another guy kind of reminded me of him. \n\nI‚Äôm not sure how to cope with this. I still beat myself up about my own stupidity years after this.

    "selftext": "(18 F) here. Wanted to know for awhile what the deal was with all the academic problems I was facing (little interest, reduced motivation, attention problems, depressive thoughts etc..) I was always a 'bright' student ( straight A's, extra curriculars, honors in classes yada yada..) even though I never put in any real work i.e studying more than 2 days before the actual test by pulling 2 all nighters in a row.\n\nThought it was ADHD/ASD for a while and was confirmed by a plethora of online resources by the DSM and others (never actually clinically diagnosed as it is a taboo here/ money issues of a minor)\n\nBut then I started thinking back to my family life and realized it was pretty dysfunctional. Everybody pretended it was ok and fine, and  I genuinely believed them. I thought every family was like that.\n\nMy Dad was physically abusive to my mom a lot growing up ( this started before I was born) and my mom just takes it and pretends like it never happens . The earliest memory I have of this is comforting my crying mom at the age of 5.  As I've grown older, I've sort of stepped in physically to stop quarrels. Dishes have been broken, bruises have shown and noises loud enough to wake the neighbors have been heard.  He was otherwise a great dad .( Hence the conflicted feelings of both love and hate for a parent)\n\nOn the outside, we're the perfect family. But internally, it really is anything but. I still do struggle with many of these memories (though I have forgotten a lot) and sometimes do cry myself to sleep (although not as much now) and have thought about *\"un-aliving\" myself several times now.*\n\nHe always allowed me to intellectually free, but had very *absurd* , *rigid* rules for other specific things. Once I had a slight fever and was laying my head on my friend ( we were both females and best friends ) and then he comes in shouting at us to stop as two *girls* must never touch in that way (???) (he was pretty homophobic in general, but  that was to be expected of a conservative Christian family)\n\nIt was *way* worse with guy friends. He would presume that any boy I was seen talking to I had '*immoral*' relations with. Even when I was too young to understand what any of this meant. I wouldn't so much as look at a guy before he would start. (On multiple occasions having hit me for the same reason without any evidence) I've had many ruined relationships with guys for this very reason. It's extremely sad to lose close platonic friends like this over absolutely nothing.\n\nI didn't understand where this mistrust had come from- I never really had any crushes or was ever a bad student- All my teachers loved me , Parent- Teacher meetings were always a breeze for them as I was  a good enough student that they never had to hear a bad word from any of them.\n\nThey have been pretty strict in regards to academics, but not overbearingly. Which is why I still don't have a reason for my disinterest in learning. I've always loved learning, but now it seems kind of pointless. I'd rather escape into other worlds by listening to music/ reading (obsessively so) I have high ambitions and big dreams but it seems so far away while I'm stuck in this stagnant abyss.\n\n*Getting a formal diagnosis is not in the cards right now, but some advice would be helpful in regards to academics or even on getting some closure.* This has been a secret I've wanted to take to the grave, but I guess there is a limit to repression of the human psyche.\n\nSo that's that, I guess. The crux of the issue. I've realized this is extremely long ( sorry about that lol) but it has been cathartic. It has taken me a while to accept and even use the word 'abuse' because it seemed to be such a foreign detached thing from my own reality.\n\nCan anyone relate?  Does anyone actually have any of these diagnosis or could help? Any advice and anecdotes would be wholeheartedly welcome.",

    "selftext": "I'm (18f) My mother was very abusive physically towards me, she's Indian and went through a lot of sexual and physical trauma as a kid, anyway she would hit me, insult me, my body, lock me in rooms, embarrass me, tell me stuff like all men want to rape you 'don't trust any man not even your father' my dad is English and I was born here, we aren't very well off so be was working and away from home all the time, my mum left her rich life in India for him. So it gave her plenty of time with me, I also have an autistic younger brother who she wouldn't lay a finger on, she once locked me in the bathroom with him screaming for hours because she couldn't deal with the screaming, sometimes I'm scared I'll turn into her if I ever have children, I don't know if I will tbh. Once in the park I was around 6 and | asked why she hit me and she said 'SHUT UP DO YOU WANT TO BE TAKEN AWAY' So she knew what she was doing. All I knew at home and at school was screaming, the teachers hated me because I joined later than everyone else because I was born in July and didn't know the 'rules' I'd get punished at school for 'misbehaving' and punished by my mum for getting in trouble at school, I had no safe space, this led me to visit the neighbour and his son, Same age as me at the time (7) and that boy would touch me inappropriately, he would take his dick out and rub it on me etc, I was also being assaulted by the boy across the street who would touch me when I visited him and my best friend who was always trying to touch me and take off my clothes, I was a little child and I felt dirty and ashamed. I couldn't tell my mother because I knew she'd blame me, or shout and hit me, Ididn't have a trusted teacher at school either and 2 boys would make me show them my private parts at school too, at this point I felt like an object so I went along with it even though I was deeply depressed, in high school a boy who had mild autism touched me, grabbed my ass, my breasts and vagina, I let him because I had feelings for him and I was already so fucked up even though his touches made me feel disgusting.. I sent a photo to my boyfriend when I was 14 and my mum found out and got drunk and started screaming at me, grabbing me, calling me a whore and a slut and to get out, my dad took me away in the car for a few hours, he told me he genuinely considered leaving her after that. When I was 16 I let myself be taken advantage of by an older boy who pretended to be my friend, he tried to have sex with me but thankfully it didn't go in because of my vaginismus, hurt like fuck though, never called me again, really ruined sex for me until my current boyfriend (19m) who is the sweetest, patient most loving boy I've met, he's really helped me though my issues with self worth and body image, even through my vaginismus, now I have a sort of normal sex life with little pain, he always stops when I need him to and checks to see if I'm ok, he's the first boy I've genuinely loved... My mum doesn't hit me anymore, she's still abusive but not as much, more a gaslighter now, I told her about how much her abuse fucked me up and she cried, we don't really have much of a relationship, every time I make an effort to bond or be her friend I always get hurt. she likes my current boyfriend though and doesnt mind him staying the night. Anyway that's my story, I wondered if anyone had advice or gone through something similar? (if they are willing to share) I just don't want to feel so alone. I have posted to other communities.",

Wow nice thing to say to a desperate and helpless 16 year old daughter of yours who wants the abuser sibling out of the house for her safety. \n\nI remember a teacher seeing i had a bruise and pulled me out of class he asked me if i was okay. i lied about it and he was skeptical kept asking me \"are you sure\"? i regret that everyday. I could have been saved. But me as a helpless 16 year old girl was scared of telling the truth and what would really happen. I was gaslight, punished and made to believe i was causing trouble just for caring about my own safety whenever i tried to reach out for help\n\nShe lately keeps making her grown ass kids victims, she has the nerve to constantly tell me that their dad called them and keeps saying how her sons say they never grew up normal family and how they dont wnt to talk to their dad. Why the f are you telling me this???  which got me ENRAGED. I went on another rampage, screaming, crying, throwing stuff, lashing out at my mom for not doing jackshit to protect me. and she gets mad at me saying 'im not talking about that' im talking about what happening with him. that statement just made it even WORSE\n\nHe dares say this shit, when he abused me?? Whenever i bring it up  in the past, i remembered she told me \"how many times you gonna tell me this? \" they had no father its their father fault. The neighbors are hearing you!\".  or in straight up denial 'What you talking about? oh that happened, im sorry\" with fake empathy.  She sees me as someone who as a nuisance  not someone with real trauma \n\nshe is well aware what her sons did  to me and chooses to ignore it and instead focuses on the bad childhood if their sons and blames other people. but not me. My abusers are let off the hook because they are her sons. It's so easy to just blame their dad right?? for how they treated me instead of her lack of discipline and pooor excuse of \"parenting\". Why the hell did this crazy woman have children? Three children at that\n\nShe cant admit she failed as a mother. She failed to protect her youngest daughter against two abusive grown men abusing her everyday. What girl wouldnt be damaged from this??\n\nI have no self esteem.. It impossible to trust anyone. I am always alert. I have social difficulties. Major depression. Agoraphobia.  PTSD,Major anger problems. I have bouts of hysteria. Neighbors have heard and complained about it. Suicidal tendencies\n\nIm 26. The same age they abused me. I cant imagine having a 16 year old brother or sister and terrorizing them and threatening to kill them. . Don't blame it on lack of father figure. There are plenty of men who come from broken homes with no fathers who treat women and their siblings with respect. You just dont want to take responsibility for creating monsters.\n\nI have nightmares about her sons. They are almost 40 now and still treating them like victims. What about ME???it just so easy to blame someone else right??I had no father either! we have different dads she choose shit men to breed with. I. The amount of damage and rejection i faced as a young child scarred me for life.\n\nI have to see pictures of her disgusting ugly sons. I have to hear their disgusting names. She tells me pity stories about them. I HATE THEM! I WISH THEY WERE NEVER BORN ! they literally ruined my life and im still trying to pick myself to move out.  They dont live here anymore, but having to live with the enabler mom and seeing her support them is not healthy for me\n\nI hate enablers. I HATE THEM she could have prevented this by kicking her sons out. Im sill in fight or flight mode all the time. I cant turn it off. I HATE HER SONS. I WISH I COULD PUNCH THEM. When i think if my mom. My BLOOD BOILS WITH RAGE.\n\nIm not sure how i can heal of this horrific trauma or heal my self esteem or believe that im worthy or this crippling loneliness",

    "selftext": "If you had to picture someone you find difficult to deal with, you probably wouldn‚Äôt find it too difficult. We all know someone who always seem to have their grump on - we dread interacting with them because their behaviour doesn‚Äôt seem reasonable to us. We might feel like they bring out the worst in us as well, that we‚Äôre stressed, angry or just miserable when we have to deal with them. We don‚Äôt like those feelings so we don‚Äôt like the person that‚Äôs associated with them.\n\nBecause being annoyed at someone is unpleasant we can sometimes try and shut it out but if we avoid being present with the feeling then we can‚Äôt tend to our anger or anxiety and deeply into it. We can start off by holding the feelings you have for that person mindfully in your awareness without judging yourself for having them. Give yourself permission to feel whatever you find - it‚Äôs OK to be annoyed, stressed or down.\n\nSo by accepting that we‚Äôre feeling, we can begin to think about the roots. What is it about this person‚Äôs behaviour that pushes our buttons? Being annoyed at someone is actually a great opportunity to explore yourself and I find that when I‚Äôm ticked off it‚Äôs as much an expression of my fear or insecurity as it is their behaviour - for example it might be insecurity about whether I‚Äôm doing a good job. I can then realise my attachment to how I‚Äôm perceived and start to let go simply by holding that attachment in my awareness and smiling to it.\n\nAs well as compassion for yourself, it really helps to develop a little compassion for your antagonist. It‚Äôs easy for us to project our own lives onto the person you‚Äôre annoyed at and say ‚Äúlook how unreasonable this person is!‚Äù; but of course, they haven‚Äôt lived our lives and we haven‚Äôt lived theirs. If we could see their lives then we would see the trauma from circumstances beyond their control that has led them to where they are today. \n\nHappy, secure people at ease with themselves don‚Äôt go around pushing other people‚Äôs buttons. Seeing that person through the eyes of understanding can release some of the anger that we feel. By wishing them well, we can liberate ourselves from suffering: may you be happy, may you be peaceful, may you look at yourself through the eyes of understanding and compassion.\n\nIt‚Äôs worth being clear though that noone should have to put up with bullying. If that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre experiencing, speak to someone you trust for support; abuse is not OK in any context. Your relationship with someone shouldn‚Äôt be causing you harm or impacting your mental health so if it‚Äôs possible to create some space between you and them I would encourage you to do so; nothing is more important than your peace.\n\n[Listen On Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/how-to-deal-with-difficult-people/id1493806566?i=1000514630974)\n\n[Listen On Google Podcasts](https://www.google.com/podcasts?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9hbmNob3IuZm0vcy8xMjNkZThlMC9wb2RjYXN0L3Jzcw==)\n\n[Listen On Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/1ozwIEgzEtHQezPoi83nVV)\n\n[Other ways to listen](https://anchor.fm/shaun-donaghy/episodes/How-to-deal-with-difficult-people-etibo7)",

    "title": "Coping With Burglary Trauma",
    "selftext": "Hello-\nI'm a little hesitant to post here just because of the all too common \"what if my trauma isn't ~traumatic enough~ mentality. But I'm really hoping there's other people who have experienced similar things that I could get advice from. If this isn't the best place to post, please point me in the right direction! I'm pretty new to Reddit. \n\nAbout two years ago, I was a junior in college and my home was broken into. I happened to be staying with my then-boyfriend that night and try not to think too much about what would have happened if I had been there, as I'm a very light sleeper and used to never sleep with my bedroom door locked. They went into my room (I usually leave my door open when I'm gone so they could've seen it from the hall) and stole my mom's car keys (I'd been borrowing her car while my parents were on vacation that week. Weird timing) and stole the car with a few other things. We don't know if they went into my other roommates rooms because they didn't wake up. Car was found (totaled), people were not. Turns out they got in through an unlocked window, which makes sense, because we had a door alarm but not one on the windows. \n\nI struggled to leave my room to use the bathroom or other things at night for a while, but felt pretty safe with my deadbolt on my bedroom door being locked. \nNow I live in a different place with no security system and I live with my cat, so I have to keep my bedroom door cracked at night (or he WILL sit and scream all night. Plus, I like him sleeping with me). I was totally fine for the first few months living here. \n\nI live in what's basically a duplex, but the other half is more or less abandoned. Nobody lives there, it's super run down, etc. Our place is surprisingly pretty cute though. There's extremely steep stairs going up to it, which is basically a robbery deterrent itself. \nAbout a month ago, the other half caught fire. Our place was fine; the other half had a small hole burnt through the floor (I feel so bad for whoever owns it just showing up one day and seeing that with no context!) \n\nWhat it did though was basically trigger the feelings of being unsafe in my home. I'm not sure why it was fairly okay for a few weeks after, but the past two weeks have been rough. At least 3-4 times the past two weeks I've been unable to sleep until sunrise due to the absolute terror of feeling like somebody is going to break in and the intense adrenaline going through me every time I hear the slightest sound. Thankfully I work evenings most days, but this obviously isn't a pattern I want to fall into. Every day I'm preoccupied wondering if I'll be able to sleep that night. I feel most safe when all my roommates are home, but even then I can't shake the feeling of knowing I'd be the only one to wake up if somebody broke in and the first room they went to if they came upstairs. I'm usually the last asleep too, being more of a night person than the rest of them. I've mentioned struggling with this to all of them and they've been sweet enough to let me know when they are or aren't home/if they're planning on getting home late/checking in with me in general. \n\nI check the doors and windows every night before going upstairs and will even check the basement as well if it's really bad. Before this past month, I would only check about once a week or so and my other roommate who lived with me at the last place would check about the same frequency.  My bedroom door doesn't lock even if I could close it. I've even made a plan with my roommates if anybody did break in (this was kind of done in a joking manner while intoxicated but it was comforting to have something anyways). I checked the crime reports of the area and the only recent burglary was nearly a mile away, which was actually kind of comforting. I've been afraid of house fires since I was young and used to have nightmares about burglaries as a kid, but wouldn't say I was conciously afraid of them. Regardless, I'm sure it doesn't help any. \n\nI was wondering if anybody has experienced a similar situation or even if not, if there is any advice. I am currently looking into therapy but am reluctant to really pursue long-term because I'm about to move away for grad school in the fall (ironically, for clinical psychology). I feel like if I can just get through this rough patch, I'll be back to baseline, but it's frustrating going through all of this again when I thought it was over.\n\nI'm so sorry if this is super long. Again, any advice is very appreciated.",

    "title": "Advice on how to cope/handle this situation with my trauma and girlfriend",
    "selftext": "I will do my best to keep this somewhat concise, but here goes nothing. I am a 19 year old male who had to deal with the unfortunate trauma of losing my mom to liver failure this past October. The liver failure was brought on by multiple decades of substance and alcohol abuse. Towards the latter two years of her life, I believe her decades of abuse finally caught up to her and she refused to leave her room except on rare occasions. She claimed depression and anxiety were her reasoning but she refused to get help or see a medical professional. During this her drinking became substantially worse. I as a young man, was forced to often times tend to my drunk mother. Times where it was really bad, I was picking her up off the floor of her room because she was simply too drunk to walk. She even fell down the stairs once on me when I was not aware of how drunk she was. For months and months I was forced to assist my drunk mother in numerous ways because she was simply too wasted to function. This continued until the last few weeks of her life when she became unable to walk. At this point, we have her no choice but to go to the hospital. There, we found out that she was in the late stages of liver failure, and two weeks later, my mom succumbed to her diagnosis. \n\nI did not fully realize the trauma this would have on me until now. I recently started dating my SO with whom I‚Äôm deeply in love with. A new issue has recently come to light that I did not previously know existed within me. When I know that she is going to be drunk or even going to drink a little, I go into a complete emotional tailspin. I do not expect her to stop drinking and I very much keep my composure around her because I know it‚Äôs unfair to her. But inside I‚Äôm a mess. We‚Äôve talked about it, and feel like there is some connection to them both being female that exists, because I do not feel nearly the same around other people drinking as I do when she drinks. I wish I could describe the feeling. It makes me want to both run away as fast as possible and fall down to the ground and do nothing. It makes me both wanna shake with rage and sob. It makes me wanna be all alone and yet surrounded. I truly do not know what these feelings are and what‚Äôs happening to me. I obviously know where they originated, but I don‚Äôt know where to go from here. It‚Äôs not fair to my SO that she has to be concerned with how I feel every time she wants to go out and have a few drinks with her friends. I can look from an outsider‚Äôs perspective and see how silly it is, but it doesn‚Äôt change the way I feel inside about it. With all that being said, is what I‚Äôm feeling normal? And if so, what are some ways I can cope with this? I don‚Äôt want it to negatively effect our relationship more than it already has. Any answers or similar experiences would be much appreciated. Thank you!",

    "selftext": "I found only one post from 5-6 months ago in which someone posted they just found out the truth about their trauma from their family. I can so relate as that is what happened to me. I feel like I have a lot of tools I‚Äôve acquired knowing what little I did know about my first few big Ts. Mostly I feel anger over my family (many of whom are investigators) keeping my trauma from me due to their undercover work I suppose is what it is. I have wondered my entire life why I have the permanent injuries that I have. Some of which I didn‚Äôt even have surgery to fix yet. I have a very strange life story, but to make it short somehow I was attacked by the very people my family on both sides was investigating. I am trying to find the right balance between keeping my boundaries and being reasonable and respectful. I am at a place though, however, where I feel I would like to cut a lot of ties. They didn‚Äôt even tell me I had a twin brother! I became an investigator myself after witnessing the same individuals hurt others. Then I was attacked very badly again as an adult due to this.\n\nMy situation is so unusual, I would be surprised to get any reply from anyone who might have faced similar things. To make things worse, I am still waiting on some major trials that will eventually be in the news as some of the people who attacked me and many others are very powerful and wealthy (why it‚Äôs been so secret and taken so long). I can‚Äôt for the life of me think of a scenario where the way my family has handled this and treated me is okay. They work in intelligence so literally nothing is or has ever been talked about. I have a famous grandmother that I never met as who she really is (not in a disguise) because I was with her when I was abducted very very young and left for dead, but I honestly don‚Äòt want her in my life even if we have things in common. Because the investigations and lawsuits are wrapping up, my family is hoping I ‚Äúcan forgive‚Äù as they finally show who they really are and not undercover or hiding. I feel I can forgive understanding their lives have been hard as well from these people they have been up against. Even taking me somewhere very dangerous or while undercover I can forgive....but I just really don‚Äôt want anyone who has kept these things from me that have impeded my healing in my life. Sometimes their cover required them to publicly be cruel to me as well.\n\nHard to explain. Just wondering if anyone has faced anything like that or what being an adult after being hurt so badly looks like for people when their family is wrapped up in their traumas. Any thoughts are greatly appreciated. I died again as an adult and was revived and literally no one in my family has said I am so glad you are still alive. I also qualify for the Olympics and anytime I bring it up nobody listens or seems to care. I also got into Harvard. Same thing. I find that so strange.",

By focusing our awareness in our body, noticing what we're experiencing, accepting ourselves and practicing non-judgement we can learn to appreciate what we have and be kind to ourselves.A body scan is a great way to do this, and it has the added bonus of releasing tension and giving us a sense of peace.\n\n[Listen On Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/seeing-yourself-with-fresh-eyes-deep-relaxation-3/id1493806566?i=1000499703450)\n\n[Listen On Google Podcasts](https://www.google.com/podcasts?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9hbmNob3IuZm0vcy8xMjNkZThlMC9wb2RjYXN0L3Jzcw==)\n\n[Listen On Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/1ozwIEgzEtHQezPoi83nVV)\n\n[Other ways to listen](https://anchor.fm/shaun-donaghy/episodes/Seeing-yourself-with-fresh-eyes---Deep-relaxation-3-emoqfq)",

    "selftext": "Hi uh.. kinda new on reddit, is this /r still alive? I just .. wanna talk about my trauma, want to be heard, to .. feel that someone really cares.. I also want help to do something about it, It's making my life be a hell, my sexual life, my relationships..\n\nI was abused as a child, several times, by different man. My mom only knows about one, I've never told her the rest.. I don't want to break her heart, she worked a lot when my sister and I were really young, we had babysitters and some of her friends to take care of us.\n\nThe first time was with my aunt's sons, (not really an aunt but a really good friend of mom who we called aunt) , the older wan was 15 and I was 6 or 7, I don't really remember that..  He touched me, leaned on me, took my clothes off, rubbed against my parts, I never had a talk about how no one should ever touch me, I don't blame my mother, I don't think she thought that could happen to me and I understand it, I wish I had that talk tho.. I was .. feeling weird? It felt good but I also felt ashamed and felt wrong in some way, I wanted to talk about it but never had the words to say it, I was too young. Then the other two brothers, they also did that stuff to me, it was gross, I .. really thought that all men do that and wanted to do that to me so I forgot that it felt wrong. I always protected my sister, so when I realized it was actually wrong I just.. I tried to get all of their attention so they wouldn't touch her, I guess I succeeded. They also were really gross to me, they treated us badly, they spat on us, they pulled our hair. \n\nOne day we left that house, I was sooo happy to leave, really, I will never miss that place..\n\nBtw, Mom had 2 jobs, she worked all day and night to feed us, to save money to buy a house for the three of us and finally did it, we had only a house,  there was no furniture, only a lil bed for us, it was hard, we had our last  babysitters, 2 men who were mom's friends, they helped us a lot with the house, bought us food, furniture, and thinks we really needed to live better, They never seemed like bad people, that's why the betrayal felt .. worse ...\n\nThe first one I will call him Ern, he was tall and fat, and the other one I will call him Ceps, tall and looked like a vagabond. \n\nErn was so nice to us, always huggs, and made us delicious food, and bought us stuff. Then he was taking care of us when mom and dad were working (There's a long story about my dad, I knew him when I was 9, because mom lost contact with him and he didn't knew she was pregnant of me, she found him on a chat that was from our city).\n\nErn, started licking me down there, touching me and  to rub against me without clothes. He made me gifts so I don't tell anyone, It felt good for me, I dunno what to say about that, don't know why, I also wanted to talk about it with my mom just because I was curious about that feeling, and if it was ok but never did, I was too shy to ask. It continued for .. 1 or 2 years? everything is very.. blurry on my mind honestly, then he dissapeared. \n\nWhen I was 14 y/o he came back to visit us again, I had a bf on internet, he was from another country, we were really close to each other. One night he was with me, I was playing stepmania,  He lowered my pants and started licking me, I kept playing without paying attention to him, waiting for him to stop at some point but he didn't, I was to shy to look at him doing it, I didn't said no because I was too shy and also felt good?? I have a mix of feelings about it, I'm really sure I have a sexual trauma that is really severe. Everything was .. ''ok'' til he lowered his pants and started masturbating, he tried to put it in and I just ran away to the bathroom and cried for .. 30 mins? it felt like forever.\n\nThen I came out of the bathroom without tears, with a normal face as if nothing had happened and I tried to play again but .. I just couldn't, that game .. I couldn't play it again. I started talking to my bf, I told him everything, and then he said ''... that's so wrong.. that's rape, that's not ok you SHOULD talk to your mom about it, please do it'' He saved me, he helped me to have the courage to tell them. \n\nThe next night I approached Ceps, leaned a little on him, and he did what I expected, he began to touch me. I let him continue a bit and then .. everything is blank, I told my dad and then my mom what they did, in a note, I just couldn't tell them. \n\nI never saw them again, ever, no clue, really, they just.. poof, dissapeared, I never asked mom about it and I guess that makes me go crazy sometimes when I remember.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen I grow up, I had LOTS of relationships (no sex) as a teenager, lots of them went wrong, I didn't knew anything about real men, and that stuff. For me, all men wanted to touch me and do that stuff. \n\nI also were really stupid, cheated on a boyfriend (I still feel horrible about that and it happened when I was 15). \n\nI'm now 21 years old, I live with my bf, we have been together for 2 years and we are happy.. but..\n\nThere's something I can't deal with, sex.\n\nMost of the time I don't want to have sex, I hate it, I don't wanna do it, I remember those days out of the blue and I stop feeling good or excited about it. When I started understanding  and I remembered what my childhood was, I compared it with everything I know now and I realized how bad and disgusting I felt, I feel like a whore, like I was a toy. Sometimes I just get horny thinking about me when I was a child being abused.. and that makes me cry everytime.. I'm working on that.. \n\n Just to be clear: I don't like children, they do not excite me and thinking about abused children makes me feel sick and want to cry and hit people in the face, which is very contradictory to how I feel sometimes when I think about what happened to ME. \n\nI repressed everything I can about that, so now I just don't know what to think when I do it with my partner, my mind goes blank and I can't feel .. I know that sex is something very important for a couple, to connect more It is a way of expressing love and it makes me happy to think about it like that but .. I think I lost interest, that I only masturbate to relax or sleep, or for some lil  necessity  and nothing else, there is no other reason. I really don't know how to talk with my bf about that, i KNOW I need a psychologist or a therapist to work on everything asap.. I just.. don't feel like.. anyone cares that much to help me, or that anyone can.. what if.. no one can help me? \n\nI don't want to feel disappointed if .. nobody can help my mind go back to what it was .. to be happy .. I have hurt myself in my arms, I have anxiety attacks, depression .. I have a happy life, I draw stuff to pay stuff, I have a dep with my bf and  I am not able to enjoy it ... constantly I want to escape from everything ... what is this? I do not know what to do ... I need someone .. I want someone to give me advice to get ahead .. that someone cares enough for me to take me to a psychologist .. accompany me .. or is that .. is not so serious to do it?",

    "title": "TW- how do I cope with childhood trauma that is now seriously affecting me after years of suppressing it?",
    "selftext": "To preface, My biological mother was a meth addict, and did meth while pregnant with me and my little brother (along with more of my siblings.) she had me when she was 20 years old, and her addiction continued to get worse and worse over the next 6 years. We were often homeless, and would eat at shelters or live with family and friends for a few months at a time. She would sometimes prostitute herself in order to get drugs, and I witnessed her ‚Äúdoing it‚Äù multiple times. She would often choose horrible guys to ‚Äúdate,‚Äù and they were often very abusive towards her and I. My younger half-brother‚Äôs father was the worst of them all. He often physically abused me, and would occasionally s*xually abuse me when I was between the ages of 3-5. My bio mother  would sleep all day and do drugs all night, so she didn‚Äôt really take care of my brother or I, so I would have to take care of my little brother all by myself (I had just turned 4 when he was born.) and since she wasn‚Äôt taking care of us/ spent all her money on drugs, I often resorted to foraging through garbage cans to feed my little brother and I, so I was extremely malnourished and he was fairly malnourished too. We were allowed to wander, unsupervised, all over a really horrible part of the slums in the city that we were from, and I was almost kidnapped at one point. Luckily I bit the man who grabbed me as hard as I could while kicking him in the nuts, and he lost his grip and I got away. I was taken away from my bio mom when I was 6, in foster care for two years, and then my brother and I were adopted together when I was 8 and he was 4. \n\nI never really dealt with that trauma and have always been that weird person that smiles while talking about their horrible experiences and makes everyone think you‚Äôre kind of crazy. And while it definitely affected me in a lot of ways, it never cognitively affected me until last October when I met up with my bio mom at 19 years old for the first time in all these years. After meeting her, I spiraled into the worse depression I‚Äôve ever had, got extra anxious, had very dark thoughts, etc. I still haven‚Äôt fully recovered and can‚Äôt get the past out of my head. Is it normal to go 13.5 years being detached to your trauma and then suddenly have it open up a tidal wave?",

    "title": "31 but still terrified by anger",
    "selftext": "Hi there\nThis is one of my first posts and I posted it first on r/relationship advice but I just discovered this channel and I think it's more appropriate here. \nAlso, English is not my native language so sorry for any mistake! \n\nSo the problem is that I, 31F, am still terrified by people when they get angry and I don't know how to cope with that as I'm now an adult and I think I act like a child when confronted to anger. Also, I physically can't help but be constantly on alert, watching the surroundings to detect any abnormal fact that may be a sign somebody is going to get upset or dangerous to me. \n\nI have to explain the background... \nI am slowly recovering from a traumatic childhood/puberty with emotional and verbal abuse which lead to a giant depression and crippling anxiety. My father was always absent and if he was here, he would be sarcastic, try to control us or make critics so he wasn't any help.\n\nMy brother was frequently so upset the world didn't revolve around him he would throw a tantrum, explode in anger saying things like \"some day, I'm going to bring a gun at college and shoot them all\" or hit things at home/furniture such as the kitchen table. I was terrorised and was afraid he would not only hit things but also my mum and I (my father wasn't there or would leave as soon as he would hear my brother was angry). The angers began when I was a child and continued when I was a teenager, they were getting even worse. I feared we would be physically hit us or injure us, that's why I stayed during the crisis, not leaving my mum alone with him (I think I was convinced he would eventually kill her).\n\nI'm starting to understand why I would flee as soon as I notice someone is angry, as soon as I see someone's brows raising or any physical sign on his face. It's like a big red flag, I know instinctly I have to leave, I can't control it, like a survival mechanism. \n\nMy problem is: my boyfriend is sometimes pretty impulsive. He's the nicest man on earth, I know he would NEVER hit or hurt me (both physically and mentally). My childish head is not really convinced though... \nI live with my bf and he sometimes works from home (more frequently now with the lockdown and difficulties going out or at clients'. He's constantly on the phone, dealing with clients and technical issues (he sells medical devices). The thing is, he can get upset really quickly when an issue occurs, would walk back and forth in the flat, breathe heavily, frown his brows... Yep, big giant red flag for me. Even if I try minding my own business and staying focused on my tasks (I also work from home), I still worry, my belly aches, I get strong anxiety... Nothing rational can help me cool down. \n\nI already told him about what I have experienced in the past and how his behavior can be seen as an alert by me. He understood but told me that was his way not to get really upset, like exteriorising his anger was a way to let it go and recover his calm (his own dad would keep everything inside, accumulate anger and explode only once it was huge, my bf avoids doing this at any price now). He also told me it was a normal behavior and he shouldn't have to be asked to change as he is not responsible for the tantrums my brother threw. \n\nSo (sorry for the long post), my question is: what should I do? Ask him to control his signs of anger, not express it, even though it's bad for him? Explain him what this kind of behaviour makes to me?\nI think he does his best all the time to be supportive, to listen to me, to comfort me (my depression is still huge sometimes) and work for both of us (I have been unemployed for a year and am now a freelancer, so no high wages). I feel like a child with all these fears, not able to rationalise clearly facts and act like an adult. \n\nThanks a lot for reading ‚ù§Ô∏è",

Reading some other posts I feel pretty dumb because in comparison, it's not a big deal. But I feel like I need to know if my reaction is normal or if I'm just bottling everything up.\n\nThe other night I was coming home from partying with a friend (we're both 19 F), simply walking when a guy standing on the sideway grabbed me HARD by the throat. No previous interaction, he just attacked. It only lasted a couple of seconds before I hit him and yelled at him back. He was screaming bitch, whore, etc at me. He seemed drugged out, and was crying a little. I wanted to hurt him back but my friend urged us to just go. I know it would not have been logical, but I still wanted to do it.\n\nI called my brother just to be safe and the next day told my parents. I was pretty out of it those two days, shaking and crying at times, but now (day three, throat isn't sore anymore) I feel pretty fine, almost like nothing happened.\n\nEveryone, family, friends seem to take it very seriously. I've checked in with the friend I was with and she seems pretty worried about me too. \n\nI don't doubt that it was pretty traumatic. I just think that I feel pretty okay in comparison, and I'm scared that I will react badly in the future and I'm just not processing it yet. Is it not that big of a deal? If it is, is there something I can do to avoid breaking down in the future?\n\nThank you in advance. I really don't want to ask my parents and worry them more.

    "selftext": "Last year, I was at the highest point I've ever been at during my life. I finally felt like I was getting my shit together, I was exercising regularly, eating healthy, felt good about my personal relationships, I was on track to graduate with high honors at my university. \n\nEverything started going downhill in October. I was SA'd and that's when things started to fall apart. Shortly after, I met a guy who I clicked with and we started seeing each other regularly. I fell so hard for him because he treated me very well at first and I was surprisingly comfortable with him despite what I had just gone through. Well, he only treated me well for a couple months. He turned out to be extremely emotionally unavailable and strung me along, ghosted me, came back months later, and then left me for someone else not even a month later. We did not end on good terms. That whole situation left my self esteem lower than it has EVER been.\n\nI felt like shit constantly since that ended, so I decided to challenge myself to go out with my friends and hit the bars instead of isolating. It helped at first, but I ended up being SA'd again when I was very very drunk in the bathroom one night. That brought back so many of the gross feelings I felt the first time, with some new awful feelings of doom as well. \n\nThat was the final straw for me. My mental health had been so bad for a while from all the bullshit, so I ended up having to drop the rest of my final semester to recover. I decided to go to a partial hospitalization program because everything just sucked and I needed help. \n\nSince then, I found out my grandparents on both sides are having medical issues and likely dont have very long left. To make things worse, my mom called me the other day and told me her cancer came back and is a more aggressive form than last round, meaning she is going to need chemotherapy.\n\nWHAT THE FUCK!!!! I don't even know what to do anymore. At one point, I cried every single day multiple times a day for 4 whole months. I used to be a firm believer that everything happens for a reason but I'm really struggling to find a reason for all of this bullshit happening so close together. I don't know what the fuck I did to deserve this.  I'm so worried that I'm never going to feel okay again.",

    "selftext": " I   am not sure what details to add here. My brain is really numb and just   not working at the moment, but I needed to reach out to someone and   figured some people might be able to offer support, advice or clarity.   If people ask questions I will try to add updates.\n\nWhat   you need to know about my grand father is that growing up, for me, he   was a great guy. He was a born again Christian by the time I was  growing  up. He was always supportive in anything I wanted to do and  spoiled me.  He took me fun places and made sure I knew I could do  anything boys  could do and would never feel lesser. His church and the  community loved  him. He was always the guy you knew you could count on  if you needed a  hand.\n\nBut from  things I know I know now I am 100% sure he was a child molester, and  most likely molested in some way, me, and my mother.\n\nMe   and my mother have kinda talked about this before, danced around it,   but I don't think we were really ready to confront it until the other   night. We were having a very frank conversation about things I was mad   at her about from my childhood. (Other trauma) when she straight up   asked me if I thought my grandfather was a child molester. My first  honest  response was \"I think he might have been, but I don't know if he  ever  did anything to me\"\n\nThen we   started to really talk about it, and all the pieces of the puzzle   started falling into place. Things I knew that she didn't, and things   she knew that I didn't. Everything from him having porn back on   his computer years and years ago, to an incident my mother barely   remembers happening with some girl on the third floor of their apartment   that got my grandfather threatened, but she thinks some friend that  was  in politics kept him from getting in trouble. To a bunch of other   things and memories that just confirmed it.\n\nWe   also know but don't know, that my grandfather was an abusive piece of   shit when my my mom was little. She is missing SO many memories, just   blocked out so much time that is blank spaces for her, but we know from   other people how he used to hit our grandmother, hard, even hitting her   in the stomach when she was pregnant with their first child. The   incident that caused that? His 11 year old year old sister was visiting   and he wanted her to sleep in the same bed as them in the middle. My   grandmother said no at first, then was hit.\n\nThere   is more but I want to keep this from being longer. Some quick details   Me and my mom were both very hyper sexual as children. (No, nothing  ever  happened between me and my mom). This more than likely lead to my   molestation at 13.\n\nI was molested   at 13 by a step family member and my grandfather gave me the choice to   tell or \"keep it secret to protect my mother\" (Which I did, for a  year,  until I self destructed and started cutting bad) My grandmother  hates my  mother more or less. We are not sure if this is guilt, or, if  its  because until she hit puberty, she was my grandfathers favorite,  which  meant all of the abuse went to her and their first born son (My  uncle).\n\nI  am not sure what to do  now, what to think. I have broken down quite a  few times. I don't know  how to continue. I have faced trauma before  being molested at 13 so I  have some \"practice\" but I am also just  blanking. And while I would not  ever hurt myself, the ideas of running  knives over my skin to feel  physical pain rather than emotional has come  up. (No, I will not ever  do this)\n\nIts  hard to reconcile  because he was such an amazing guy for all of my  childhood that I  remember. And people loved him. But now I am  questioning every memory,  and I don't know if I am seeing the truth, or  reading into things that  are not there.\n\nIf you had anything that can help, please share. Because I am barely making it through the day.",

    "title": "Is it possible to be too traumatized to ever date again?",
    "selftext": "Is it possible to reach a point where you are too traumatized to ever have a romantic relationship again? \n\nLet me give you some backstory: \n\nMy (32F) first serious relationship was when I was late-teens and my ex was manipulative as hell. In the end, I was in a different city, away from family and friends, wasn't allowed to use our car, speak on the phone during the day, or go to visit my friends. Everything was hidden behind subtle reasons that at the time sounded reasonable to me. We ended us breaking up when he dumped me after having cheated on me for a while. \n\nThe next guy I dated for multiple years, and while he was seemingly much better, he too had some control issues. He kept blaming me for spending too much money (he did most of the spending), spending too much time on hobbies and with friends (when we met he played his sport semi-professionally and had one evening a week free during the season and was the one who liked to take weekend trips with his buddies). He had hard rules on how I was supposed clean, do laundry, fill the fridge, keep my car, etc, and I never did it right no matter how much I tried (I even took notes when he showed me how things are supposed to be done). He accused me of cheating when I, via my sport, met a guy with whom we started couching a begginners class. He very rarely helped me with things like walking my dog if I had to stay late at work. Often I had to ask a friend to do it. He also, during every argument, used the line \"let's break up then\" until one time I said \"okay, let's break up\". After the breakup he made my life a living hell due to us owning a house together and the situation led into me being 120k in debt and he walking out with enough cash from me to purchase a brand new car (he also bought a house right next to mine). \n\nThe last relationship I was in felt different from the get-go. He was really supportive and gentle, we spent hours by just talking. When we moved together (far away from the house that had my ex as a neighbor), he always walked my dogs without a question. Everything went great for almost five years until everything changed. He started an affair (I didn't know), and manipulated me into moving a thousand miles away so we can start a new life there. The only thing was, he was never planning on coming along, but was planning on moving the new girl into hour house the minute I was gone. I found out about the affair the night before the flight was scheduled. For the next six months, he kept lying to me about how things are over with the other girl and he just wants another chance with me. When I finally gave him the other chance, turned out things were never over with the other girl. \n\nAfter him, I've tried to date a couple of times but everytime the guys have turned out to be huge assholes. Once I even got rap*d and after this, I decided I never want to date again. \n\nIt's been a few years. I haven't dated. I say no when someone tells me they have a good friend who I should meet. I don't have Tinder. I don't even see good-looking men on the street or movies. In the past year, I have also started to withdrawn from friends and family and feel uncomfortable sharing any parts of my life with anyone because I feel like I have unlocked a secret level and now know how people are. \n\nI don't really think all my friends husband's and other men on are bad guys per se, but I do think there's something in me that only attracts bad guys (and people in general) and I clearly cannot read them. Or that it's me who make people like this. \n\nI've seen a therapist ever since my latest ex pulled his stunt and was even hospitalized for a while for depression. \n\nSo, my question is: is it possible to be so traumatized from past relationships you can never date again?",

    "selftext": "TW implied CSA, mentioned animal death\n\nWhen I was a kid, I was very close to a relative of mine. He was older than me but not by much, 3-4 years.\n\nThe thing is, nowadays, I know he's a very dangerous person. He kills small animals for fun, literally. When I saw him at family gatherings, he was only nice to me. He was very mean and standoffish with everyone else, especially my older sibling who was his age, and he would often pull me away and we would be alone. he would try to convince me to hurt my sibling. I never did of course, and I was naive and young, so I thought he meant hurt as in a push or a slap. He mentioned something about a knife before though. I can't remember.\n\nAnd that's the biggest issue. I can't remember. I really liked this guy as a kid. I thought he was cool and thought his sort of \"edgy\" behavior was funny. And he seemed to like me too. Probably because I was very easy to manipulate.\n\nSo can you blame me, thinking back on it, KNOWING I was constantly alone with a guy like that, and I can't remember a THING?\n\nI only remember very small bits and pieces from different moments. But we met up a lot. Anytime there was a family get together. And I remember in total probably only 20% or less of all of this. Maybe it's due to how young I was at the time. Maybe it's because he did something really bad to me and I've blocked it out. And that's the part that scares me most.\n\nIt's really distressing me. I just want to know. I can handle it. Not knowing is so much worse. But I can't ask him because after my family found out how creepy and dangerous he was (and his mother was also pretty crazy too) they stopped going to family gatherings. I never told them about the meeting in private with him thing, though. Plus, it's not like I'd ever want to get into contact with this guy ever again. The idea scares me so much. And like, he probably wouldn't tell me the truth anyways. He'd probably lie just to make me feel worse. That's the kind of guy he was. So really, will I ever find out the truth?\n\nI'm sorry this is sounding more like a vent, but I do need genuine advice here. What DO I do? I want to know the truth, but no matter how hard I try, I can't remember anything. Should I just find a way to stop caring about this? Does anybody else have any experiences about memories they unlocked?\n\nThank you.",

My younger brother was growing up to be physically, verbally & emotionally abusive towards everyone in the family - specifically towards my mother when I was a kid. It always made me feel deeply disturbed.\n3. Since me and my brother shared a room, he once put his hands inside my clothes and freely explored my private parts. I was a kid - I didn‚Äôt know what was wrong with that. He also bit my breast once when we were playing.\n4. When I was in college, I guess it would be the first time I learnt to speak up for myself and felt free to state my opinions. So my family visited me near my alma mater once, and I spoke up when my dad was misbehaving. He physically threatened me and didn‚Äôt let me leave the table - he shoved me and my top came off from one side. He didn‚Äôt care about that, maybe because he was drinking, and continued to act aggressive and threatening. Though that may be the first time he disapproved of my behaviour and also the first time he put his hand on me.\n5. Once my brother turned taller/stronger than me, he started freely using the strength - he tried to hit me right before my first job interview, after I got into the job, right before my first solo trip when he sat on top of me and tried to suffocate, and it kept happening and I mostly kept leaving home.\nAll the physical abuse happened right in front of my parents.it would just be a repeating cycle which ended in some sort of an impersonal apology every time. At the end of such episodes I would just feel sad, hopeless and nonexistent.\n\nAll of it truly stopped when Covid hit the country. I kept travelling for months while all 3 of my family members suffered from it. \n\nToday I told my dad about my brothers point 3 about molestation above. \nHis answer can be summed up in 2 points: \n- children are innocent\n- this is okay, but he wanted to know what else happened that made such big of an impact on my hatred towards men today. (I asked him if he could imagine doing that to his sister, and that is when he got a whiff of what was wrong with my brothers behaviour and shut up).  \nFollowing that, my mom felt bad & started mentioning suicide. To calm her down, I tried to cheer her up. My brother unceremoniously came in & said, ‚Äúso nothing happened right?‚Äù\n\nAny thoughts on my situation are welcome because I‚Äôve lost all perspective except that I don‚Äôt want any close/personal relationships at all, and I want to move to Goa alone and focus on my corporate+music career.

Combined with the pandemic and loss of loved ones, the past couple years have been miserable and I've felt like I haven't made any progress in my life/career. But I've recently started a new job, working under new a boss (also a white male), who actually seems to be a great person, and others say he is indeed very nice and does not criticize people frequently. So far, my interactions with him has been great -- he has been supportive and encouraging, and I like the work I'm doing. \n\nAnd yet, the bitter memories of my past bosses and the abuse I suffered are holding me back in my daily work. Every time I encounter a technical difficulty at work (e.g. a design I made doesn't work, something takes me longer to do than I planned, etc.) I am so anxious and always on edge, fearful that my new boss will turn out to be nasty like the old ones were, like I can't afford to make mistakes in the fear that my work will again be judged to be inadequate. Every time something doesn't work out the way I thought it would, I keep being reminded of the nasty gaslighting and abuse my old bosses hurled at me. It's almost like I can hear them standing over me with a whip. I just want to be able to get out of this constant panic mode and feel calmer and be reassured that the past isn't about to repeat itself. Can anyone please suggest how I can wipe these bad memories from my mind? It's almost like I want to hypnotize myself into thinking the old bosses never existed, and only remember my current nice boss. Thank you!",

I had an emotional flashback 3 years ago over a misunderstanding w him? and its caused me to have panic attacks around him, so it really hurt this younger part. Unintentional but I learned not to blame her and to remind her, he is NOT my parent. She still idealizes him however. I have another hypersexual part of me, she wants to pursue him just for the heck of it. My inner child gets sad and scared about it.) \n\nAnywho, my therapist said I am overthinking, and suspects I may like him romantically. This made me uncomfortable at first, but I agreed with her theres nothing shameful if I do like him. Still, he makes it clear he sees me as a young kid. He didnt even know I was 22 til recently, he literally thought I was a teenager. He still treats me as a kid, with gentleness and respect. He softens his voice around me and calls me hija. I told my therapist I feel gross even imagining intimacy with someone who sees me like that, idk. \n\nI do have a hypersexual part who kind of wants to be with him or any man really. Im in inner conflict about sexuality about men. Hes the only guy I could tolerate dating I guess. Only issue is, whenever I try to imagine intimacy with him, my stomach feels like it is churning with acid. Its like nerves are firing in my stomach, even at the thought of simply cuddling him. Heck in a real life situation he hugged me and i got that sick scared somatic feeling despite how much I otherwise care for him. Our attachment is not really a secure one honestly. Hes just a kind, but distant person in my life and i appreciate it, even if trauma makes me feel weird intense, varying feelings about him. Is it bad to force myself to imagine tnis stuff if it hurts my belly?.. i hate explaining this situation about my coworker to anyone because its so blurry and weird. \n\nAll I wanted was to learn to untangle panic attacks around him w therapist, not have to figire out this sexuality or romance stuff.. its scary to navigate with the somatic feelings.

    "selftext": "Trauma bonding is when you're attached to a person who consistently betrays you in one way or another. Yet, you feel addicted to the abuser and panic at the mere thought of leaving. One part of you want to leave, another, stay. This inner conflict usually stems from the abusers confusing behavior, shifting from cruel to tender. You find yourself making excuses for their behaviors no matter how many times you get hurt. One of the reasons for trauma bonding is the attempt of resolving your childhood traumas through the destructive relationship. You try to get the abuser to change and love you even though they show little or no capacity for healthy love.\n\nOne way to break this unhealthy addiction to a person is to undergo trauma therapy. One of these therapies is the evidence-based treatment method EMDR. It helps you to resolve your childhood traumas, release stuck energy from your body, and give your body and mind long-awaited relief. EMDR also helps you to finally put the past in the past and give you a real chance of living in the moment and being more at ease with your body and mind.

Somehow I feel it invalidates the serious issues these things have caused me and like it really must not have affected me at all, but at the same time, I have some ptsd symptoms, especially after what happened in September. But also when I‚Äôm talking about what happened, I tend to separate myself from the situation and talk about it like it happened to someone else or almost like I‚Äôm explaining a scene in a movie or book? It‚Äôs kind of hard to explain. \n\nIt‚Äôs just really bizarre that I can talk about it so casually and feel almost like any symptoms, like flashbacks, panic attacks, or nightmares I have due to the situations are fake and not valid. But my fear in those moments feels so real.",

In and out of therapy, on and off meds, nothing has really stuck as being long-term effective for me.\n\nI know I have been given a good life. I have a good family who is mostly supportive, I‚Äôm not well-off by any means but I know that there are many who are less fortunate than me (especially now) and I certainly have had plenty of opportunities that I know many people only dream about. But I feel like‚Äîand know I am‚Äîa total waste of a life. I have been bullied in the past, most relationships and friendships I‚Äôve ever been a part of have fallen apart (and I know with me being the constant I‚Äôm clearly the problem) and I feel like I‚Äôve wasted every good opportunity I‚Äôve ever been presented.\n\nAbout a year ago I attempted a test that would help determine my future, and whether or not I could make my dream a reality. I failed, but knew I was completely unprepared and was determined to try again. I spent 6 to 8 hours a day for a solid 6 months of the pandemic studying my ass off. I heard all about how the test was ‚Äúlearnable‚Äù and as long as I put in the effort I would pass. Putting in effort has never been a problem for me so I was optimistic. I ended up not just failing again, but getting the EXACT same score I got the first time. Not only did I fail miserably, I feel like I completely wasted so much time, and it confirmed that I am just destined to be a failure. I could barely think straight for almost a month. When I tried reading books on emotional trauma recovery, hilariously, I felt too much trauma and anxiety to keep reading. I still feel it, months after the test.\n\nI know this has been mostly a rant but I just don‚Äôt know what to do. I feel like this is another layer of mental trauma that has just been slapped on the pile of emotional issues that is my life. I feel like there‚Äôs literally no point anymore. I‚Äôm ruining the relationship with the one person that cares about me because I just can‚Äôt handle myself right now. I don‚Äôt want to kill myself because it would ruin them, but I really don‚Äôt feel I deserve to be alive.

I know the usual ‚Äúthis is all temporary‚Äù and ‚Äúlife is about ups and downs‚Äù but I‚Äôve lived a fairly long time and it‚Äôs been almost all downs. I feel like I know all the things that someone should say to a person in my position, but I just can‚Äôt implement any sort of advice into my life and I‚Äôm losing hope. I try so hard to shift perspective, be grateful for what I have, and try and change my life for the better, but every single time I do I just fuck something else up. This probably all sounds quite melodramatic or attention-seeking; I can assure you it‚Äôs not meant to be, I just honestly don‚Äôt know how else to present my thoughts. I don‚Äôt really have anything particular to ask, since I know there‚Äôs no ‚Äúsolution‚Äù to this. But I guess maybe someone can relate to this or find some use in it.",

I had two loving, un-divorced parents, a great financial situation, plenty of food, clothes etc.  I wasn‚Äôt abused or neglected or assaulted as a child either. \n\nBut I was diagnosed with depression + anxiety when I was 11-12. Plus I read a study that if you have been called an ‚Äòold soul‚Äô, meaning that you were very mature from a young age because you felt like you had to play the role of an adult/the older one (‚úÖ) are a people pleaser (‚úÖ) like to deal with things yourself,even scary/hateful/harmful things (‚úÖ) procrastinate a lot (‚úÖ) etc. you probably have dealt with trauma. \n\nThe only thing I can think of that could‚Äôve formed trauma was my brother. I always thought it was normal sibling stuff, but now I‚Äôm questioning it. My brother has ADHD/a lot of anger issues, and if we got into a mild-medium level bad argument, it would probably lead to him yelling at me and basically having a temper tantrum or him beating me up in some way (usually punching) and me having a lot of bruises. This would happen about at least once or twice a month (sometimes more often tho) He‚Äôs good at manipulating, and would usually try to make me not tell our parents. I hides it a lot. This happened mostly when I was 3-10 and he was 5-12. \n\nAs a child when my brother did those things to me, I felt like it was just a normal sibling thing to do. But at the same time I felt very isolated, very helpless, that I couldn‚Äôt handle my situations but I wasn‚Äôt allowed to go to someone else to help me. I was often very uncomfortable around him and I did a lot of things to make him think I was his friend so he wouldn‚Äôt be mean to me and gave in to him when I shouldn‚Äôt have. Since then I‚Äôve been slightly uncomfortable around boys and men and are in some cases, scared of men that are similar to him. \n\nI‚Äôm sorry about being dramatic but I want to know if this could‚Äôve caused trauma.\n\nEdit: Hey everyone. So your responses meant so much to me that I finally talked to my therapist about it and she said I could have some trauma. Thank you guys so much.",

Both of us have been in therapy until about mid december of last year.\n\nShe's recently hit another snag with recovery but was patiently chipping away at it. And while that definitely put a strain on my own health and on the relationship, we were constructively working through it and making slow but steady headway.  I myself lost a big chunk of my support network outside the relationship in the second half of last year due to a couple of 'get out of the crab bucket now or be dragged down again' situations. All of those came completely out of the blue for me and shook me something dreadfull. Had to cut ties with someone I considered almost like a sister, wasn't sure whether or not I would have to cut contact with my parents until about two months ago and had to put a hold on another good friendship because said friend overstepped previously established boundaries in a big way, doubled down hard and still refuses to accept responsibility. All of these were positive steps for my own well being but it was emotionally draining and I'm absolutely not over what it knocked loose, yet.\n\nIt was basically my trauma in a nutshell three times over within two months. Unfortunately, I can't really talk about what's going on with my so atm because all of it hits home hard with her. She tries her very best to be supportive but it's all trigger material for her - meanwhile, my own core trauma is exactly this. Having genuine support only to have it snatched away the next minute because whoever I'm talking to caught a trigger and is now in full survival mode with me as their target. It's incredibly frustrating and painful for both of us as you probably can imagine. And it's not helping with either of our recovery. We've already taken emergency steps to break that particular viscious cycle. She's currently staying with the family of a close friend who have stepped up in a major way to support both of us when things started to go downhill last year. They are truly good people who have experience with dealing with mental health in their family without overstepping boundaries and are good with being supportive without being intrusive.\n\nThe obvious long term answer is therapeutic support. \n\nThe kicker? Our therapist hasn't opened up again afrer the holiday break without prior notice. It's pretty obviously some kind of emergency situation since it's not her in the voice mail message informing callers about the office being closed and it's not at all like her to just leave her patients high and dry like this. So, yeah. Unexpectedly lost our therapist, too. With no info on whether or not it's a permanent situation or for how long it'll be the case, so we're dealing with it as if it were permanent. Figuring out alternatives will be doable but tough both financially and emotionally and progress has pretty much been put on hold for the forseeable future. No trauma focused self help groups around here either. \n\nRight now, I'm just weary to the bone without seeing any light at the end of the tunnel.

    "selftext": "Hi all, hope this is the right subreddit to be posting on. Need to speak of this and get some advice. yesterday my mom (56f), dad (60m) and I (24f) went go to see a movie since we all had the day off for holiday. As the movie was started, I noticed a middle aged woman crying and grabbing her husband. A second woman was on the phone with 911 telling them the man wasn‚Äôt breathing. I was the first to notice among most of the people in the theater as the previews were so loud. I calmly told my parents that there was something serious happening right in front of us (slightly diagonal and in front, I was the closest). Soon everyone started to notice and everyone jumped into action. The lights were still down and a nurse and doctor in the theater helped move the man onto the ground to perform CPR. My father was helping clear people away, and my mother was holding the wife and turning her away from her husbands body. They needed light and I was closest and I turned on my phone‚Äôs flashlight and shined it on the man. All I could then see was his dead eyes slightly opened as my flashlight shined on them and his body being aggressively pounded on by the medical professionals. Then, he started to vomit and as he was pounded more his vomit came out more and his eyes still open and lifeless. The nurse and doctor kept saying there was no pulse, no pulse. Finally, the lights came on and the paramedics arrived. We were all whisked out of the theater but my mom stayed behind with the wife. I sat outside and my dad went to go smoke in the car from the stress. I then watched the man be furiously rushed out with the wife following being escorted by a paramedic as well. \n\nWe went home (parents dropped me off at my apartment) and at first when I was finally alone I cried and shook and cried and then threw up. My mom tried to call me but kept talking about the wife and I just didn‚Äôt want to speak. To anyone. Then, i just sat the rest of the evening staring. I tried to turn on the TV but couldn‚Äôt focus. I kept thinking about the mans eyes and the vomit and his body lifelessly convulsing as the CPR was performed. Last night I slept a bit but just couldn‚Äôt stay asleep. Had trouble falling back asleep. My mind was just not tired. \n\nAll day today I have felt extremely distracted and weird. Not sure how I feel. It‚Äôs good to note that my parents did not witness what I witnessed as my father was getting everyone away and my mom was comforting the wife turned away with her.

But a couple days ago we were having a heart to heart conversation about how my mom and his relationship is ( they are both working through their trauma and trying to get better). It‚Äôs been a rough couple of months as they both try to work though their shit and I was having a hard time as well since I still live with them and hear them argue and fight a lot. But when we were having the heart to heart conversation he told me about how he was molested as a child and that he hated it and wanted to break that generational trauma ( this is where it goes south and I can‚Äôt come to terms with what he says next). He then tells me that god was really testing him when he gave him 4 good looking people (I have 3 older siblings two brothers and a sister) and that he was glad he didn‚Äôt do anything to us ( speaking about me and my sister). And he said that so proudly that it felt disgusting and just not right at all. Then he tells me that it helped that I was bashful about my body and covered myself up a lot.

    "title": "why does everyone hate me?",
    "selftext": "Throughout my life, I've never had anyone be nice to me or love me for who I am. Growing up, I didn't have much money or was even trendy. According to my mom, I've always been kind and caring, never rude, and lashed out at people. I have never been the type to talk. But when I liked someone, I would talk a lot.  I am disabled, but no one around me knows. Yet, despite all of these traits, everyone hates me.   \n\n\nSince I was three, everyone has hated me. It started with minor aggression like crying when I was around, hitting me, taking stuff from me, etc. when I reached the age of five, a kid tried to hang me with a balloon string at church. I was pushed down three stairs at seven and had a broken tailbone for a year. At age eight, I was verbally harassed and told I would be better off dead.   \n\n\nAt nine, stuff was stolen from me, emotion nally abused, and physically harmed; at age ten, I was told I should off myself by everyone I knew. At eleven, I went to a place for teens and preteens; there was a 17-year-old on high on mary jane who tried to through me off of a 10-foot deck on my way to my car; he was carrying his backpack in front of him and ran at me shoving me to the floor, I got back up, and out of adrenalin I was able to swap positions with him and pushed him off the deck and ran to my car. He returned the next week with a sprained ankle, a concussion, and a hurt back. But since he was so high, he thought he fell, and when I confronted him, he had no memory of what had happened.  (my parents didn't know this was happening; I was invited by an older \"friend\" I had, and since I was 11, I didn't know what to say to them. )  I still live in the same childhood home since birth and learned that he is now 22 and works at a nearby Publix; happy for him for becoming clean that young and that he has a Job, but still damn wtf.   \n\n\nThe Panasonic virus outbreak on my 13th birthday, but a month prior, my family and I planned my \"becoming a teen\" party with all the people I liked. We were going to have a big mall celebration. I didn't even have a phone; I had an iPod with a google voice number that went through my dad's cellphone. So I created a group chat with all of them, and they told me that, and I quote, \"We're very sorry, E, but we don't want to come to your 13th; you aren't really our friend, and honestly your pretty lame, no one loves you. Hope you have found some new people that would care.\" I was 12. These people were from 11 to 16 years old; the 16yos were writing this to a 12-year-old... what the hell.   \n\n\nSpoiler alert, I didn't make new friends. 13 years old and on the internet looking for someone to talk to. Bad idea. People started to tell me to KMS and that they hoped I fell into a coma. I got exploited by a climate change cult known as FFF or Fridays For Future. 14 I started getting stalked by people around the united states and got death threats. Fifteen joined an mcSMP and got bullied, and non-consensual personal info was used and spread across the entire group by a member.  They told everyone I was harassing them, that I was a jerk, and that they hoped I died irl after I was concerned for the kid and the owner's well-being. This kid made a shrine confessing love to a friend of a friend's dad, a doctor in Cali, so I made an unlisted private video on youtube to show two people why I was worried about them. I was sharing it via discord, and I don't have Nitro, so youtube was the second best thing to share with a link. I was going to share it with the owner's parents and one of the people I was super close to. No one else saw it. Two people. So when I left the thing, I was part of it. I left a message saying, \"If you don't see me again. it's because I am dead.\" not meaning let me go myself, meaning I have killed the person that I was when knowing them, killing the past. After I left, they were still harassing me and started a rumor that I was blowing up everything they built in their Minecraft server, which I never did. Plus, I have been teaching digital citizenship to other kids alongside my mom since I was 5. so me doing this for \"revenge.\" as they were saying, wouldn't add up, especially because I'm a quite career-based busy person. oh, then they also said that I hired a hitman. Firstly illegal, and I don't make a lot of money (I can't believe I'm even writing this now.)   \n\n\nAnywho, I just turned 16 on the 14th of this year and have received about 7 different aggressions and at least two comments of kill yourself. These are all just the highlights of my bullying story. It doesn't even cover all the other minor things I've experienced on top of all of this. My family and friends have been dying like flies throughout my life due to health conditions. I've lost about 20 people I cared about in the past five years. I was also getting more diagnoses for health issues mentally and physically.  since I was about 6 or 7, I've been doing sh and, most days, think about dying. I just want a break. Everyone hates me. I'm so scared to try to find friends anymore. I want to start pursuing further with my acting career because I'm gifted in the arts and always have loved it. But since everyone so hates me, I've been thinking about whether that is really a good idea. Because with casts and crews, your work months and months together and there is are always people who don't like me so why make those people suffer just because I want to do something I'd find happiness in. the thing that makes me the saddest is seeing the people around me sad. If actors are happy with their acting, I don't want to come and ruin set life for them.",

    "selftext": "Could really use some advice on self regulating // feeling safe. I (24F) have CPTSD due to CSA and growing up with narcissistic parents. Once I fled that environment, I fell into an abusive relationship. It took me two years to begin to be able to function again and move across the country to rebuild my life. \n\nI have two housemates, 23F and 36M. At the time of moving in, I didn't know 36M was that much older than me. He showed his red flags early -- arrogance, entitlement and anger, notably -- but was easy enough to live with once he got a handle on his anger. \n\nI left the city for about two weeks to help take care of some family, and 36M agreed to watch my pets for me. We agreed that my pets could be put in my room if they wanted to be let in the space. However, within one day of me being absent, 23F let me know that 36M had been letting himself in my room and had fallen asleep in my bed. Keep in mind that me and him don't have any form of relationship -- we aren't even friends, we just live in the same house.  \n\nI've been dissociating heavily since I found out. I don't want to go home. I'm obviously going to get locks and have a serious conversation with 36M when I return, but that isn't enough to make me feel safe. Apparently when 24F confronted him, he just laughed it off. \n\nMoving out isn't really an option. My lease is still valid for six months and finding a place to rent in my city is a hellscape. With that being said, I'm going to be looking anyway. In the meantime, are there any tactics that could help me feel safe in the space when I return? Due to the intensity of my CPTSD, I've kept a list of suggestions from therapists and group therapy members on how to feel safe, but not a single one has worked. I don't expect there to be a simple solution that can magically fix the problem. I know that's impractical. I just want to be able to exist in my space without reverting back to a state of non-functioning. \n\nTLDR: Took two weeks away from my rented house to help out family, and my much older male roommate slept in my bed. I'm immensely triggered and don't know how to feel safe in the space when I return.",

    "selftext": "I have so many things I need to address. I don‚Äôt even know where to start. My childhood definitely wasn‚Äôt the worst it could have been. But my parents were not great people. My dad was violently angry but rarely hit us. I spent most of it protecting my younger sisters from the worst of it. So much so that I‚Äôve become the bad guy because I‚Äôm trying to heal. We basically raised each other. I‚Äôm 3 years older than my youngest sister. I honestly thought I could grow past all of this but now that I‚Äôm a parent I‚Äôm finding myself falling into patterns that I‚Äôve seen from my parents. I swore I would not become my mother. But here I am with the I told you so and the cold distance when I‚Äôm tired. My mother was emotionally distant for most of my childhood and never tried to understand me. She just saw our similarities and decided I was her clone. And anything she did to hurt me was ‚Äújust a joke‚Äù and I was being ‚Äútoo sensitive‚Äù or ‚Äúover dramatic‚Äù or ‚Äútaking it the wrong way‚Äù. And I won‚Äôt deny it. We are very similar. Often times we will do thing‚Äôs separate from each other and end up doing the exact same thing the exact same way. You‚Äôd think she‚Äôd use that to try and bond but no. She used it to try and control me. She‚Äôs always wanted to put me in a box and doesn‚Äôt like it when I‚Äôm not her ‚Äúperfect daughter‚Äù. We are so similar I can tell you exactly what she‚Äôs thinking and what‚Äôs she‚Äôs going to do next. So when I say talk doesn‚Äôt work believe that it‚Äôs more than trying once or twice. She‚Äôs an action kind of person. Actions will tell you more about a person than any amount of words. We tend to get passive aggressive with each other instead of addressing things. And either it works or it doesn‚Äôt. If it doesn‚Äôt then we just agree to disagree. It‚Äôs kept our relationship stable. I‚Äôve learned what I can talk to her about and what I can‚Äôt. She‚Äôs more like a distant friend than my mother. My son is only 18 months old and I‚Äôm already worrying about him eating too much. And he‚Äôs fine. He‚Äôs tall and growing fast. So he‚Äôs going to eat more. I don‚Äôt want to put my irrational concerns on him. I never feel like I‚Äôm doing enough to make sure he is happy and healthy. I‚Äôm fighting the urge to helicopter. My mom says she did the same thing and that‚Äôs how she ended up being the way she was. Although she thinks she did a great job because my sisters and I are doormats. I don‚Äôt want to hover but I don‚Äôt want to be my mother either. And now I have a daughter who is the spitting image of me. I definitely don‚Äôt want to treat her the way my mother treated me. Every time I see something in her I have to tell myself that that trait is hers and not mine. Other wise I might see one thing and then start treating her the way that makes sense if it was me. I‚Äôm so scared I‚Äôm going to mess up my kids the way my parents messed me up. I don‚Äôt want my kids to bond over trauma. What makes this worse is that I have my dad anger. My moms anger was cold and silent. My dad often threw faulty game controllers at the wall. At one point I thought I‚Äôd masted my anger but I guess my parents had finally deflated me. My speculation as to why it‚Äôs resurfaced is that I‚Äôm not living with them anymore and my wife has helped to restore some of my confidence. But also living on our own and starting our life together is stressful and anxiety sucks. I‚Äôm in therapy and working on getting properly medicated for anxiety and ADHD. My therapist prefers to focus on what currently going on rather than addressing the past. I don‚Äôt know how to come to terms with any of it. I don‚Äôt know how to not let it affect my life or my kids life‚Äôs.",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone\n\nThis is my first post ever and this is difficult for me.\n\nI want to share a story that even the most of my friends and family don't even know (those closest to me know... or even witnessed)\n\nI'm currently doing EMDR therapy and while I'm not ready to cover this chapter of therapy yet, I'd like to talk about it anonymously. I'm going to keep it shorter than it really is, but I'll do my best to give the most important details.\n\nso here goes...what happend 20 years ago.\n\nI was a confused rebellious teenager of 16 years old when I started a relationship with a man 7 years older then me.\nIn my first year of collage (we were 2 years together) we lived in a house together with my brothers and their girlfriends.\n\nIt was my first year of freedom and away from home. I was more or less a good student. I went to all my classes and tried my best to pass my assignments and exams.\n\nIn that first year I met a lot of new cool people, I opened up more and more... but against the wishes of my 7 year older boyfriend. For example: He would get angry if I went for a drink with classmates for 1 hour after class. We argued a lot. He was very threatening but not violent (doors, glasses, whatever... excluded)\n\nThat year I started to realize that we were not a match, that he was controlling and not supportive.\n\nAt the end of the first year of college, I was fed up. I was tired of it.\nEven though I had exams, I couldn't handle the pressure and stress of the relationship anymore. I then broke up with him.\nWe also lived a different life, I was 19 years old and a student. He was 26 and had been working since he was 18.\n\nA day or two later after the breakup, I came home from an exam. I wanted to pack up some swimming gear to go swimming with classmates to blow off some steam. At that time my ex was in the kitchen cutting a melon with a potato knife. He approached me to talk about it but I declined and told him to do it later. I was busy with my exams and needed some relaxation and distance. I also wanted to be home as little as possible when he was there.\n\nBut then.. I had not expected his reaction to my refusal. The potato knife he was holding, he used it to cut into his wrist several times. He was bleeding very profusely. My first reaction was to push him to the bathroom and run his wrist under cold running water. After that, everything is pretty vague for me.\nI temember my brothers and their girlfriends were also at home (everyone had exams). They came down from the noise of arguing.\nI don't remember whether they or I called an ambulance myself.\nMy memory afterwards is that I started doing the dishes. What I remember then is one of my brothers telling me to stop and sit on a chair. \nThe next memory is that I was just staring straight ahead into nothing.\nAfter he had cut his wrist everything went very blurry. I would describe myself as apathetic at that moment. Nothing came in nor out, I was muted, I continued on autopilot.\n\nYears later, when I was of the age when he started a relationship with me, the idea of age difference disgusted me. I didn't understand how he could do that.\nAn age difference in itself is not a problem, but it is between 16 and 23. That is quite different from someone aged 23 and 30.\n\nI also felt that he wanted to avenge me by cutting himself, in addition to the break-up pain he certainly felt.\nI can't imagine anyone wanting to commit suicide with another person around. But I still dont know what his intentions were.

In the end, he made up some stupid excuse to be with his side hoe.\n\nFew years later, he's popping up everywhere on my fyp. He cosplays. Goes to weeb events and parties in my area quite often. I see him at conventions all the time. He's become pretty popular, has a larger following than me, has a very large friend group (some of those people have thousands, even millions of followers). It frustrates me. I can't go to any anime convention or event without fear of running into him. I just can't believe that people can befriend someone so disgusting and vile.\n\nOn his pages, he goes on about how people should stop sexual abuse in the cosplay community, yet he sexually abused me and even has an onlyfans. He also cries about how he was bulimic to get people to pity him, even though he was never diagnosed by a doctor, and can only recall one account where he forced himself to throw up his food. He's now a personal trainer at a gym and is most definitely on steroids.\n\nIt bothers me that people can like such a hypocritical liar. It's just so hard for me to get over this.",

    "title": "How to overcome unresolved bullying trauma?",
    "selftext": "The bullies werent punished and i believe in punishment. I never got an apology or explanation which is how i get closure. I tried my best but never fought them since they are mentally slow and would have probably broken me despite me being a girl and them guys, they mostly stopped after a while but their behavior was inexcusable, I also have problems with tolerating abuse, not defending my self, severe emotions to the point where i was quick to anger and cry, fear of conflict and wa sa pople pleaser and since10th grade - anhedonia/lack of emotions/feel mostly dead/numb. The only time I could relax, smile and basically breathe oxygen was when i was not at school but i had no social life so lack of verbal communication with anyone ruined me mentally, in a way i was happy when included but still knew no one wanted me but when I was alone I was free but also lonely because no one wants me but hy at least i can smile without someone commenting on it. Idk why but i refused to defend my self even when it came to being slapped, so i went to wing tjun for one year but that had mixed results, it seems i have personal issues with agression, violence and paccifism despite being a woman I am very sensitive, somehow girls who were bigger tomboys than me dressed more feminine were more respected but me having short hair and baggy clothes was too much and I had to be bullied, and the guys knew fully well i couldnt hit back which makes them a cowards, especially since they are a group and i was an alone anorexic underweight shy girl, the girls were horrible and i found it hard to relate to either gender or talk to them, ive always been a tomboy in the sense that i dressed liek a boy and liked video games (never liked or was big into sports or was agressive, like probably what a real tomboy is)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n I never put other women down but most girls were nasty so i had - not like other girls phase because in middle school girls were more nice to me, but i still didnt understand them, so i never felt threatened to hate them but in middle school i wasnt told i will die alone and was pressured to have a boyfriend, some guys never stopped treating me badly or refused to sit next to me which hurt me since i believing in people changing, idk what made some guys change and others dont but i do want to become more assertive and respected, i feel like when i died emotionally i stopped caring but i also avoided my peers a lot and refused to speak with them verbally, sometiems out of anger, mostly because I became mute and overwhelmed by everything near me and had to wear headphones, most people cheated on tests and i was hated for studying but eventually studying didnt bring me any joy so i just stuck to my fantasy books and did what i could for school. I used to be hyper extremely empathetic and now i struggle to care about anyone even my mum with cancer, I also struggle to trust anyone or express emotions due to being laughed at and humiliated all of my life, I know I was sensitive but i didnt deserve any of this, whether i was annoying or not, how these sociopaths had girlfriends yet somehow mistreated me is beyond me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have only became more suciidal after reading about everyone beating their bully and me not doing it, it wasnt so much fear that i think these guys would have beaten me up due to ego problems and hating me and i hate being touched with a finger and would have probably ended up with broken bones but most fights are resolved without fighting, I reported it but it didnt help, i just wonder what kind of monster would bully a lonely girl without friends who struggles to speak and has a mother with cancer, its like they lack that self awareness that being mean doesnt make you cool or powerful, you look like a clown, me refusing to gossip should have given me more friends and make me better but people who were more shallow, dumb and mean had the most popularity, I struggle with being femine without feeling like an evil ho that manipulates everyone because thats what i have seen, apperently to everyone on reddit I put other women down but i hate men much more since they make me feel unsafe, and no that doesnt make me an incel, incels want sex but cant get it, i just feel unsafe and uncomfortable around guys but do want to connect, unfortunetly i can only talk about anime and even if girls like anime they arent that into it since they have social lives and male attention, and guys always choose them which makes me averse or even trying to flirt aftering confessing, being rejected and made fun of on love. I want to move on but struggle since they got away with it and broke me mentally, I used to constantly read articles on narcisstic abuse and how to supress emotions/anger issues but i really just need to be more assertive, learn how to set boundaries and stand up for my self, its something ive always struggled with - defending my self and managing to make/keep friends since people think i am weird, i try to be interested in them but feel like no one likes me or wants me due to abuse, sometimes that is imaginary, most times not - I also hate - eye contact, being laughed at and touched, it makes me feel insane idk why but it makes people annoy me more, i cant understand when i should ignore people, when i should speak ,what i should say, communication is hard for me and i am always either annoying or boring so i just learnt to be mute which made people even angier.",

English is also not my first language so I apologize in advance for any mistakes. \nI‚Äôm a female in my 20s and there‚Äôs this guy (same age as me) who‚Äôs been one of my best friends since high school, so quite a few years now. I‚Äôve truly always seen him as nothing more than a friend and pretty much considered him as my own brother I never had. I‚Äôve never been even remotely  attracted to him in any way. And as far as I know, it‚Äôs always been the same for him in regards to me. However, during the course of this year, we went on a trip together and well, things happened between us (that is, we didn‚Äôt all the way sleep together, but we did sexual things and I ended up going farther than I had with any other guy). Thing is, we weren‚Äôt even drunk or anything, but I was ovulating and therefore was feeling really horny. I should mention I‚Äôm still a virgin. He did not force me in any way. He did not take advantage of me. It was all 100% consensual. And I was even totally fine with it for a while. We stayed friends and I thought of it as ‚Äúoh well it was just a physical thing between us and we can move on‚Äù. But after about a month or so I started feeling extreme disgust, shame and regret thinking about it, feelings which I can‚Äôt seem to escape at all. It‚Äôs led me to barely speak to him anymore and I don‚Äôt even think I could ever see him face to face again, at least not anytime in the near future. I often times can‚Äôt sleep because I get flashbacks of it, or I‚Äôll get them randomly while I‚Äôm doing something and it makes me want to rip my skin off. I have tried to forget so much and I just can‚Äôt seem to do so. I‚Äôve also tried dealing with it in any other way, I‚Äôve tried accepting it but it doesn‚Äôt get any better. I‚Äôm also afraid for the next time I become intimate with someone and how I will react. How can I experience sexual trauma without having been assaulted/abused? I don‚Äôt even know if I can call it that. It‚Äôs 100% my fault for going through with it and wanting it, and now I have to deal with the regret and shame. Is there anything I can do about it or how do I go about processing this so I can move on with my life and not have to ruin this friendship because of my own stupid feelings?",

    "title": "Intense guilt over overcoming trauma/doing well in life",
    "selftext": "Hi all, I'd like to pick your brains for some advice regarding an issue I've been having recently. I am an adoptee, abandoned at birth who came to the UK at 6 months old. From what I understand, the pain of this separation constitutes a trauma (adoption trauma seems to be highly misrepresented/misunderstood so please kindly refrain from any comments invalidating mine or anyone else's struggle if possible). On top of that, I suffered cumulative traumas as I grew up due to heavy invalidation of my inner struggles and emotions, developing perfectionism, near compulsive tendencies and intense shame as a result.\n\nThough I continue to struggle and work through things (this year in particular has been very difficult due to finally processing the adoption) I'm doing reasonably well in life. I've hit every milestone that most consider important (save for any kind of relationship which continues to elude me but that's by the by) and I've done a complete 180 in many areas. I work in healthcare in a semi-stressful role and am even considering doing additional training as a counsellor due to the impact my experiences have had and wanting to help others reach their potential as I have done for myself.\n\nSo why do I feel such intense guilt for doing well? The adoption subreddit is full of horrific adoption stories. I have seen friends go through awful bereavements, marriage breakdowns, borderline depression. All while I've been constantly up and down on my own personal rollercoaster which I feel pales in comparison to theirs and others on this planet. I am trying to channel the guilt into something constructive with my career path and other endeavours but I can't help but feel I am almost unworthy of the good fortune I've had.\n\nMy parents gave me a solid foundation, pushed me to study and get a good undergrad degree when I probably wouldn't have been as bothered. I have my own roof over my head, wonderful pets, friends and family. I've done a ton of reflection and come so far... hell, I see it as a luxury to even be here sat on my laptop, having the time and energy to contemplate my life and work on myself while others are not anywhere near as fortunate. That's another thing - we're in such a technologically advanced age. I've been shamed before for looking things up by older family members because back in their day you didn't just look stuff up, you learned from doing etc. It's like I can't win - I feel guilty for having the tools and foundation for success and the resultant success I have...\n\nI want to pursue a role in the education sector of my profession (pharmacy) as well as the counselling because I feel incredibly passionate about giving other people the opportunities for growth that I have. I feel it is very much my purpose... but how do I process the guilt before (and during) my journey on that path?\n\nTl;dr - feel guilty for having things good in my life and overcoming a lot of struggles, How do I move past this before it becomes its own avoidance mechanism, or stifles me even more than my past struggles ever did?\n\nI'd be very grateful for any advice at all that anyone can offer me.

Specifically he punched me in the head and face multiple times (he  managed to punch me in the eye). My mother also slapped me multiple  times after. My parents always go for the head or face. I am 21, and  though this has been the first time it happened in a while (mostly  because of physical distance), it is something that used to regularly  happen to me since I was 12.\n\nI've  been grappling with depression and mental health issues from a young age  and kept it to myself because my family had very vocally negative views  on mental illness. This made me a very irritable and volatile child. To  be clear though, it only manifested in me being angry all the time and  quick to talk back at home, however I was non disruptive, active and got  good grades in school. I was never the type to act out physically, only  with words. That has always been the main reason cited for me being hit.  I acknowledge that I am someone who is very blunt with a very sharp  tongue, even from a young age.\n\nMy  father worked abroad for most of my life but whenever he came home we  would fight and it would usually end in me being backhanded or punched  and us not talking for months when he left a few days later. My mother  and I would fight almost every other day and she was very fond of  slapping and pulling hair, and even strangled me once. I have never  fought back physically. I come from a family where violence as  discipline is seen as the norm and even encouraged, so my  grandparents would just say I should be grateful I don't get hurt worse  and that I am well provided for. My mother said earlier that it's better  that she hurts me physically rather than cursing me out because \"at least she isn't trying to attack my self esteem\". Basically, I'm  always told I brought this on to myself.\n\nWhen  I was younger, I thought this was normal and happened in every family. I  said to myself that it's okay as long as they never left bruises. I  feel like I'm the crazy one for resenting this treatment. In the few  years since I last got hit, I've just been suppressing the memories and  feelings of that time. Even now, I can't help but have the thought that all of it was my fault and I deserved to be hit.  Even now, I can't help but think it's okay because they haven't hit me in a while. However, being hit again as an adult, I'm  starting to question if I really deserve to be hurt? Is this normal?",

    "selftext": "CAUTION: The following account may contain offensive or adult references and may trigger some. This is not my intention, of course, but I wish to share without censoring as I do with everything else.\n\nOne of my 'triggers' is when someone stares at me. I feel especially uncomfortable if it is an attractive female (I am a male). I feel like something is being demanded from me, that I am being scrutinized and evaluated and I don't like that feeling. I don't feel insecure, as I know I am attractive male, but most of the time I am \"not ready\" to engage in that way. I wish I could get out of my head and anxieties and just let \"nature run its course\" but that has always been difficult for me, as I am a fairly hypervigilant/hypersensitive person. I also find most Americans (I was born in the USA) intolerable - especially ones who are not older or wiser. I think most of the reason is because I don't want to deal with sexual things or encounters.\n\nSome background: I think I might have been sexually abused (father or mother, idk) and was definitely psychologically and emotionally abused by my mother. I never had a stable masculine image growing up (mother was married 10+ times and is Bipolar) and I was made to feel that to be a man was a dirty and evil thing. I lived in an oppressive legalistic religious household where nothing was ever good enough. Despite being fairly attractive (as I am told) and 'normal' aside from being fairly introverted, anxious, and cerebral, I finally decided to leave my religious identity and lose my virginity at 26 (which also was a mess, as I was criticized then too for \"having a great tool but not knowing how to use it\"). I am 31 and never had a relationship longer than a few months, and I have only had a handful of those. I tried experimenting to see if I wanted men instead, and that too does not work. I may be slightly less on edge with some men of similar temperament, but I don't like sex with men and I feel the majority of men to be oversexed selfish idiots. I cannot readily orgasm with either gender. The easiest and least stressful thing for me is paying a woman to massage me, and that is it. While I have assumed more 'normal' masculine roles during intercourse, I feel I have to be angry and buzzed to perform that way, otherwise I find it difficult to enter into that more 'animalistic' state with someone I love.\n\nIt has always been difficult because I feel like most people can't understand me. Some people say that but they don't have any traumas and grew up in fairly normal homes. When I say it, I am certain it is true. I am a Black man, and I defy the majority of stereotypes (by some conscious effort but mostly a result of upbringing). I am also an American that doesn't buy into and hates pop culture. I am also someone who dedicated my life to being a better thinker/problem-solver and spiritual individual. I know I have some value on this earth - and I want to leave a legacy like those featured in textbooks - but this is a challenge for me and I used to wonder if it was worth it.  I used to want to be a lonely academician who never saw the light of day but continuously produced groundbreaking research - but I realized I can't fit that image either because I don't really want to anymore. I want to live and love just like everyone else, just with a little less influence from Hollywood. I want to have a healthy relationship and have healthy uplifting sex at normal intervals, but everyone in my age range  - they seem like a different species. The things they care about, the drives they have - I cannot relate.\n\nAny helpful thoughts? I am trying to heal and be better.",

Due to my own condition I could only help her a few moments at a time before I too would get sick. It got so bad, her mom had to come save her and take her to the ER. Shes there now. Ive never been depressed in all my life. But here I am, a grown man, bawling, wondering why this is happening to us. I feel so trapped in my own body that I couldnt take her to the hospital. I am shaken by how violent her screams of pain were. I am heartbroken to see her going through this. She witnessed me go through Norovirus, and now I know how she feels now that I had to watch her suffer so greatly. \n\nWhy can a human body suffer so greatly without warrant? Im not seeing any hope. I fear we'll never make it out of this. I cant even be at her side to care for her. thank you for reading",

    "selftext": "I recently had a kinda huge breakthrough with my sexual trauma (there's a lot) and I've managed to feel emotions again and I'm actually in a thruple now! we r all very open and we love eachother and we all have our own trauma so we help eachother to try and heal both as a group and 1 on 1. it's amazing and I don't think I could ask for a better thing to happen to me at this point. here's where my question comes in, due to my sexual trauma, up till very recently (maybe 2 weeks ago?) the only way I knew how to receive and give love is through sex, or through being physical. I'm finding my love languages slowly which is fun but I feel like I'm not being loved because 1 of my partner's libido is lower then the other, thus, there isn't as much sex with them.\n\n I know this isn't tru, they love me very much and I love them very much but because of the prostitution from age 15 till also fairly recent and the excessive incest rape I dealt with when I was 12, the only way I received \"love\" was through sex. I'm trying to break myself out of this and I'm obviously going to have a convo 1 on 1 with each partner and together as a group to find a solution that fits us but is there any suggestions from the wonderful people on here on how to kinda break that mindset? logically I know the difference but of course my brain is being mean and it's hard to push the thought of \"they don't love u because they aren't having a lot of sex with u\" away. I also know they're trying to help me with my trauma by slowing down on the sex to make sure we have more then just sex to bond over and that means the world to me as I've been hypersexual for the last decade. this partner also has a similar sexual trauma to mine so I know they're also fighting their own battles so I want to be there for them but, again, until very recently my \"love language\" was only sex cause that's the only form of \"love\" I knew. I wanna make sure we can all heal and I wanna share the universe with them both but I don't want to push them away due to my own trauma.\n\nTL;DR sexual trauma got my mind stuck on sex being how u show love in a relationship, how can I break that mindset both for my sake and my partners sake?",

    "selftext": "Hello\n\nTL;DR/As the title says: I have a tendency to think everyone eventually will hurt me, or break my trust and I have no idea how to fix it (Help)\n\n(TW) A short backstory: When I was 15 I was assaulted by a classmate and friend when he asked me to come over to his house after school. This is five years ago now, and somehow I'm still not over it. \n\nI have done A LOT of work when it comes to trauma, I have been in therapy and done spiritual work which has really helped with flashbacks and everyday functioning, but when it comes to my relationships I just can't fix my problems. \n\nI hate it, so much. I believe everyone lies in order to gain my trust or just in general, and that they eventually will use it against me, especially in my close relationships. I always decide beforehand that the outcome of any, literally the smallest confrontation, will be negative. For example, if I were to tell my boyfriend that I don't like something he does or says I'm afraid of/it honestly feels like there will be \"dangerous\" consequences. \n\nThat is probably the most draining, and maybe what I struggle with the most. The fact that I have convinced myself that I can't trust the person I trust the most. It hurts so bad. No matter how many times i tell myself: \"if he loves me as much as i love him, he would never do anything to break me\" i just never believe it. Im walking on eggshells when i really dont have to, im literally torturing myself with thoughts about \"what if\" and \"when\". \n\nI think i hide it pretty well. I have told him a bit, but not the full extent, i don't really have the courage to tell him either. I think im quite ashamed of the fact that my trauma still runs so deep and that i just cant get a hold on it, maybe that's the main reason. It's the invisible part about it that hurts you know? He sometimes smiles and says things like \"your PTSD hasn't been so bad lately, i cant remember the last time you had an episode\", and he seems so proud. And there i am, feeling so lost in my own head, not even able to pinpoint the emotions i feel. \n\nI have all the reasons in the world to trust, and still i feel like i have an endless amount of reasons not to.\n\nI don't think I trust myself either anymore. I don't know when my feelings are genuine or rooted in trauma, I don't trust my instincts to tell me when something is actually wrong or if I am just overthinking it, I don't trust myself to do what is best for me in situations where I really should put myself first. \n\nAnd deep down I know, like the logical part of my brain does factually know that not everyone will eventually hurt me. That my boyfriend won't leave or hurt me because i tell him \"no\", and not everyone lies all the time. I just can't grasp that concept. \n\nDoes anyone have anything that could help me? I'm open to basically anything, alternative or not. Books, your own experiences, or just tips in general. I feel like I have tried so hard to find an answer and I'm just stuck.",

I'm sorry to say it in such a way, but I'm still trying to process it, one year later. I cut all ties with him on the day I found out. It was also the day I had my first panic attack and it's the day I usually consider the beginning of an MDD episode that lasted 8-ish months. \n\nSo since then a lot of things are better. My panic syndrome went into remission, as well as my MDD. I genuinely feel a lot better. \n\nHowever, I just moved to another country for university and I began recognizing a weird trend. Maybe it's anxiety, maybe I'm just noticing now because of quarantine. But whenever I meet another man, I feel like I can't trust them. When I talk to them I just feel like, I don't know, a wild animal being approached by a human. Just that feeling that I have to be alert and he might be dangerous. I'm sorry if it's not the best description, I'm not the best at describing my feelings lol.\n\nThis is particularly bad because I moved in with a flatmate and I feel this is straining our relationship.\n\nMoreover, now I developed this weird sense that the women I meet at parties/etc. might get hurt and I don't know if I'm (bad) anxious for them or if I'm (good) anxious because I'm attracted to them. \n\nAre there any strategies I could use to manage this?",

    "selftext": "Hey, so first of all please apologize my grammar because I am not native speaker.\n\nSo I do not know where to start, I finally feel like I need to tell someone about everyhthing I went through, after years of thinking it was nothing and only me being too weak and sensitive. And since I can't find any other place and I refuse to tell it to anyone that knows me, here I am.\n\nMy parents got divorced when I was 5-6 years old, till then I had probably pretty happy childhood, I rememeber few argues and ugly words being told , but I didn't care much. I have older brother so I think he remembers more of it. But after the divorce things got worse, I don't remember much from my childhood, but there are certainly few things that I'll probably never forget. We stayed with our mother and I occasionally went visit my father for a day. After a divorce my mother was emotional wreck and totally unstable, she also started drinking A LOT. At the time I didn't know what alcohol was, so I had no idea why she started behaving so differently, she would scream at me, cry, do weird things and  just have total breakdowns while being drunk. I remember for example once I was just playing in my room, she came in, sat down and just said she's going to die and started crying with her thin high voice, I was still a child so I didn't know what death was and so I just suggested she'd go to hospital and then she started explaining to me in most drastic way what death was and I remember crying so hard afterwards. My  brother was 9 years older than me, so he probably protected me from most of the bad things she did(he basically raised me), which I am really grateful for, but now I can tell that his trauma is much much bigger than mine. And now the problem wasn't only our unstable mother, but our father as well. He was very selfish and really big emotional abuser. When I went to visit him and there was something  wrong with me, due to my mother's lack of care, he'd just shout at me and tell what everyhting was wrong with me as if it was my fault when at the time I din't know how to take care of myself. Almost every visit he'd find something and make me feel like piece of shit for it. At the time he'd found a new girlfriend with two kids and I have to say that she was probably the kindest person from my childhood. But then I'd come home and my mother would give me horrible looks and tell my how awful she(father's gf) was and I as well for going to my father, even when I had literally no choice. So this is how it went for years and it got worse when my brother moved out for collage and I was left alone to deal with it all, alone with our mother. One big accident happened when I was 11 and I came home from my father's and mother was totally drunk, she'd fallen asleep then pissed the floor and when I started panicking because she again started crying , telling me terrible things, took me out in December and told me to go and never come back. But I managed to get inside and call at least father so he came and when I tried to get to him, my mother strarted screaming, pulling me back and it was just terrible, I was really terrified. I didn't want to go to school or home next day, but I had to and pretend like nothing happened. At least after that my brother came back and really shouted at my mother and she quit drinking, Of course few times I caught her, but when I said I'd call the police or someone and leave her, she quit totally. In her defense at least we never had a financial problems and I always had what I wanted. My father never changed tho, he always kept telling me I was terrible and almost evertyhing was wrong with me.\n\nAnd with these problems at home, school was terror. I had anger issues, I'd cry a lot, be rude to classmates and a bit aggressive. I'd attack and actually harm someone thinking it was just a joke and of course I felt terrible after that, and so I became weird kid. As some kind of coping mechanism I started reading a lot as escape( I do not know wether I would be even alive today without that, because I thought about suicide so many time when I was just a CHILD) I wore glasses, so now I was made fun of for being nerd, having terrible clothes style, also my figure changed as I got older(I was never overweight) but people would still say that I was fat because I had big boobs, so I felt like I was even less than nothing. An ugly awful freak.\n\nAnd that is not all yet, I joined volleball team when I was 11 I guess. At the beginning it was kinda okay ,bcs I was among poeple my age or younger, but when I got higher and got to team where we'd go to comeptitions  there were suddenly girls older than me. I was't specially talented, so they gave me hard time as well as trainers and when we were traveling somewhere in bus they push my seat, throw things at me, make fun of me, spit on me and sometimes hit me. It was just terrible, also during regular trainings they'd hide my things that we had in dressing room or throw them to shower. And when I went and complained about it to trainers , they just dismissed me. Only later I realised they were probably alcoholics too and one of them probably a pedophile. So here I suffered as well.\n\nThankfully I quit volleybal after four years and started doing martial arts and painting, something I trully enjoyed. My mother got clean(but our relationship will never be the same, I can't forgive her and forget), I left my old school and began new one( I still had real issues first year, but I got best classmates ever, so that helped). I stopped talking to my father much later, but I learned how to stand up for myself. So after all that it at least gave me something, now I'm stubborn, not sure if it's a good thing, but I can stand up for myself and somebody else. Also I'm very independent, but isolated when it comes to real me and I pretend to have all the confidence and joy in the world, like no one and nothing really bothers me. And I started doing professional illustrations, even when I'm still at high school.\n\nBut it did take a toll, I am the most self-conscious person ever, with no self-esteem, so I am working on that. I am also very closed when it comes to my emotions and everybody's approvement matters to me( I apologize for everything a  lot).Few years ago I started having issues with being around other poeple, to the point when I started feeling nausea and started shaking and felt like I'm gonna vomit or faint, so I found coping mechanism for that and started wearing black(head to toe) and I still do that.Also I flinched a lot when somebody touched me or stood too close and I hated physical touch, like hug and I still do when they do it without my permission. I have very vivid nightmares, so that I usually wake up in the middle of the night and I can't sleep for a long time. I have body image issues, I don't know what I actually look like anymore. Am I fat or skinny? Beautiful or ugly? I don't know anymore, I tend to wear a lot of eyeliner and baggy clothes so no one else can tell. Two years ago one boy at the pool called me fat,after I was maybe a bit rude about him splashing water while swimming. I was 3 kg overweight then, but I lost weight since then( I have healthy weight now), but now again I can't tell what my body looks like whether I am still fat because I have big boobs or not. I am really insecure about everything I do too. Like I am smart, maybe  bsc I got mostly A's without learning anything ot actually taking notes, I know solution to a lot of problems but still I doubt every single thing that I do or say. Unless I have one of the moments when I can argue with anyone and win thanks to my stuborness, which is kinda ironic. Also I still have a bit of an anger issues when I'm angry I'm able to scream out my lungs and be violent, but never actually hurt anyone physically,but say most hurtful things to them even when I don't actually mean it just to hurt them. And I feel like I'm annoying and everybody hates me and talks behind my back, even when I know it's probably not true. And also that nobody will ever love me, because how could they when even I cannot love myself. Also what I noticed I have little sense of self-preservation, I do things that hurt me, go throuh sometimes insane amount of paint to do somehing(for example when I'm at martail arts training) and when I get hit or something i just totally ignore the pain and make myself do the thing that I need just to defeat someone or prove that I am not weak even when it is serious. Also I feel like crying it the most embarrasing thing that I can do, I feel ashamed before myself for that so I don't cry and then it's just too much and I have a breakdown when I start crying and I cannot stop no matter what, it's worst when it happens in public which it always does. Also I used to feel preassure on chest like somebody was stepping on me with his whole weight, and it took a while till it stopped , it usually happened when I was upset.\n\nSo yeah that's it, I've been getting better as I said, but I still have a lot of issues because I just don't want to talk about this with anyone, bsc I feel embarrased and feel like I'm just too sensitive as I was told quite few times. So that's it, thank you if you read it till here, I just wanted to  finally tell someone and I'll hopefully feel better.  And I realise that many poeple had it worse than I did ,but maybe somebody with similar experience will read this, hopefully they'll know that they're not alone.\n\nHave a nice day",

I know I was a child, but I do genuinely feel stupid for not thinking for myself. I already struggle with a heavy sense of self doubt, and this is just more evidence that I‚Äôm not really that smart. I feel like if I was actually an intelligent person I wouldn‚Äôt have been so gullible. \nI would‚Äôve been like my ex was as a kid... he rebelled against his parents. He had his own opinions. He was very defiant and strong willed. I really wish I had been more like that. \nOr is this just a matter of different trauma responses? Did I just fawn my whole childhood, whereas he ‚Äúfought‚Äù? \n\nCan someone tell me if my line of thinking is off or how?",

    "selftext": "I did not have a terrible childhood, far from the worst, but I do think it left me somewhat traumatized and with some maladaptive bonding systems. I come from a family that was distant, avoidant, angry, and where there was a lot of emotional neglect; emotional abuse was common, as well as infrequent, but highly unpredictable physical aggression occurred (I still struggle to admit or qualify it as physical abuse). Yet despite these things I was given everything I physically need  as a child and then some. I had secure living, food, clothing, supplies, there were times my parents could be quite loving,\n\nAs an adult I have become acutely aware that I am highly affected, stimulated, and even desire a very cat-mouse like relationship. I really enjoy and become intrigued with people who where I am  unable to guess what's next, unsure of where they stand, where I stand; where I have to work at getting their affection, show that I have value by their currency . I enjoy a degree of volatility within a relationship. When things are going as I want , I become so incredibly infatuated and attached to people who give me the adrenaline, dopamine surges, but of course crashes are intense and bring up so many old feelings of rejection, anxiety, fear, unworthiness, that their leaving, or hurtfulness was my own doing , that I'm at fault.\n\nIn my life I have had 3 boyfriends who are the exact opposite; the were kind, caring, understanding, they wanted a relationship with me , the offered security (I mean they were human, they had faults), but they were healthy. I gave them an opportunity not because I was highly attracted to them, but because they were offering something healthy, the kind of relationship that at my core I want- I want to be deeply loved. Unfortunately every time I feel unstimulated, bored, the constant availability of affection makes it seem less valuable, and my sexual desire is very low in these relationships.... the safety makes it feel so friendly once the initial excitement wears off.\n\nHow does one retrain, rewire a nervous system, adapt a biochemical system to long for and enjoy healthy relational bonds? How do I get my brain/body to want what is actually loving and not the rollercoaster that I have learned to find enjoyment in ?",

    "selftext": "Im 17 rn. Never been a good kid. Not in my opinion, atleast. Always made huge messes, got in trouble all the time, stayed out too late. Spent like 9 months in foster care when I was 13-14. since I got out, my moms tried to convince me to join a suicide pact with her twice. She insists it didn‚Äôt happen cuz she doesn‚Äôt remember but I remember one instance very vividly. Had a panic attack during dinner and laid down on the ground. Mom was drunk. Instead of comforting me she just sat next to me and said, ‚Äúhey, why don‚Äôt we take a bunch of pills together?‚Äù It hurts to remember. She hates when I try to kill myself but apparently it‚Äôs fine when she tries to kill me. Is it my fault? Do I deserve this for being a bad kid? Dad cant help cuz he killed himself when I was like 11-12.",

    "selftext": "So a couple days ago my boyfriend tried to commit suicide. He overdosed. He took 6 adhd pills and 3 painkillers. He lives in a different country so I could only text him. I was there for the whole thing. He regretted it soon after and kept telling me that he doesn‚Äôt want to die. He kept saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm suffering‚Äù and ‚Äúhelp‚Äù but I couldn‚Äôt do anything. I tried to get him to call the police but he kept refusing, he has a pretty bad home life and was afraid his dad would be mad. I could hear his heart beating on video. I saw his whole body shake and one side of his face become numb. It was hard for him to breathe. People told him that he would die. He eventually got so exhausted that he just went to sleep, I was afraid he would never wake up. Then a miracle happened, he woke up and was completely fine. I was really happy but that night was so traumatic for me. I feel guilty for it even though he keeps telling me that it‚Äôs not my fault. Our relationship was in a bit of a rough patch. It feels like I keep reliving what happened, I zone out in school and remember that night. It was hard for him to walk, it was hard for him even to talk since he kept running out of breath. He even started hallucinating. I felt so awful that I couldn‚Äôt do anything to help him. How do I stop thinking about this, I just wanna put this event behind us but I keep thinking about it.\n\nFor reference im a 14 year old male",
