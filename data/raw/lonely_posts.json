To get this off my chest.\n\nI feel I have forgotten on how to make friends.\nI really feel I don't belong anywhere anymore, I don't really like the people on the internet, I always get overstimulated by the amount of content and information there is, people there are negative, they scare me, they are rude, and as I have been talking about my insecurities, internet has just made it worse for me.\n\nI feel very lonely most of the time, I have never been loved in my life, I have never been in a relationship,, or anything even close, no one has ever liked me, I haven't had a hug since I was like 5, I'm 19M, I know, but it is hard for me to really ignore that, I don't want anything like y'know, I'm ace, I just want love, I really do, I sometimes daydream when I'm going to sleep of cuddling up to someone.\n\nTo keep with what I was saying earlier, everywhere I go I feel I don't belong, I don't fit.

I really don't know what to do. Where I'm studying, in college, everyone is so damn different from me, most of my classmates play games, go to parties, go out, I don't do any of that. I don't fit there, I had studied for a year something else, and I left, just because I felt alone, and I liked what I was studying, but what was the point if I didn't make friends there? I feel sorry, and I do not what for.",

    "selftext": "I grew up on a farm 12 miles out of the nearest town where I went to school. Throughout my childhood and  teen years it was routine to wake up at 6, go to school, and then, barring any extracurricular activities, straight back home. I had basically no social life. At 16 I had my first girlfriend and thought maybe since I had my own car, some extra freedom might come with that territory. Boy was I wrong. I can't count the number of arguments between my parents and me fueled mostly by them wanting me home and me not wanting to be there. At 18 I was shipping out for the farthest away university that had accepted me and was still in the state.\n\n While at university I met four really great people. Iz was a nerdy gamer otaku guy. J was a spirited music major who was just fun to be around. S was a vibrant hyperactive everyman, always the life of the party. And B was an ambivert scene queen with more talent and potential than she ever realized.\n\nAbout a year after meeting these 4 my girlfriend broke up with me. Long distance wasn't cutting it for her. I spiraled. Lost all my passion for my major and floundered the end of that semester. I managed to recover though and started dating B. \n\nIz, B and I were thick as thieves. We did everything together. They were my best friends at the time and I truly loved B despite some of the more harsh aspects of her personality. \n\nJ and B were roommates, so I started seeing J a lot more often and by proxy, her boyfriend S. Things went really well for a time. Until my ex came back into my life. I hadn't gotten over her and so when she came back, of course I went running. I have mixed feelings about that decision to this day, especially since she broke my heart again just a year later.\n\nIz left the dorms due to a public embarrassment on Myspace and stayed in touch for a few years, but it was now me, J and S. Until it wasn't. S had substance abuse problems and J finally had enough. J left and it was me and S.\n\nMy time with S was the most exciting and eventful chapter in my life. He was a people magnet. Our friend group swelled into the dozens. I could hardly keep track. S got a new girlfriend and that's when things really started to go downhill.\n\nIt was a cold February morning when I was jolted awake by our house mate's screaming. He'd gone to see if S was up yet since it was getting late. S had overdosed on heroin.\n\nB and Iz made it to the funeral and we caught up a bit over lunch afterwards. The friend group we had amassed stuck together for a while, but without S to catalyze around we all started to drift. One of our friends stuck with me for a long time but eventually he moved on too. I got back in contact with B briefly a few years after S died and the conversation went well. Two months later she was dead.\n\nB had a blood disorder that made her one of the closest things to a human vampire a person can be. Black diamond anemia. She literally needed other peoples blood to survive. But she had a bad habit of missing her transfusions.\n\nToday, Iz is in the wind with no way of tracking him down. B and S are gone and the pain of them passing is still as fresh as the days they left. It doesn't dull. It doesn't fade. It's been 15 years.",

    "selftext": "When I was a child I dreamed about having a friend. That dream never came true.\n\nI was alone in the kindergarten due to the social anxiety. In the primary school I was trying really hard to overcome my anxiety and talk to people. My classmates were often rude. I was beaten sometimes. Frequently no one wanted to be in a group with me. I found some people to talk at school but they weren‚Äôt interested in meeting after classes.\n\nThe middle school was even worse even though I wasn‚Äôt beaten. I was ignored completely. I had absolutely no one to talk to. I sat alone during all classes. I had to do group projects alone and had no one to exercise with during the P.E. when there were exercises in pairs. Yet, I was desperate to find a friend. When I tried to talk to someone, I often got one word replies or was told to go away. I tried almost everyday to befriend at least one of them, unfortunately to no avail. \n\nThis primary and middle school experiences completely broke me. In high school I completely gave up on socialising and only focused on getting very good grades and on my hobbies which became my obsessions. Fortunately my classmates weren‚Äôt hostile and I was accepted in groups when there were group projects. But I always preferred to do it alone, if possible, because it always reminded me about the middle school when I was begging people to accept me in a group. In high school I was living in my imagination and made myself believe it‚Äôs enough as finding friends was an unrealistic goal.\n\nOn daily basis it wasn‚Äôt that bad. My quality of life improved significantly as I didn‚Äôt need to be scared of getting bullied.\nOnly during the vacation time loneliness became unbearable.\n\nAt university I decided to try again to find friends. I didn‚Äôt want to be as desperate as I was in the primary and middle school, and I didn‚Äôt intend to be as distant as I was in the high school. I was nice and friendly, talking to my classmates whenever possible, however, I took care not to be clingy. This also didn‚Äôt work out. My classmates weren‚Äôt hostile and nice but not interesting in being friends and meeting outside the university. \n\nThen the lockdown happened and it was a blessing to my tormented mind. It was much better to be physically alone than alone among other people. When I came back to the university, I cried during the first day. It was a painful reminder that I had no one to talk to. \n\nAfter the graduation, I realised that I was unsuccessfully trying to find friends for about two decades. My childhood was over, my teenage years were over, my early twenties over, and I haven‚Äôt experienced friendship even once. I also realised that human connections are the most important thing in life and I was deprived of that. Hobbies can‚Äôt replace it, as I believed formerly. \n\nI fell into severe depression which lasted a few years. Only then I realised how traumatising was my primary and middle school.\n\nEarlier I was telling myself that even though I was beaten in the primary school, I wasn‚Äôt really injured, so it wasn‚Äôt that bad. And even though I was ignored in the middle school, I wasn‚Äôt beaten, so it wasn‚Äôt bad. \n\nDuring that depression the mental pain was felt physically. Every waking moment was agonising. That‚Äôs why I slept as much as possible. Sometimes I cried a lot, sometimes I was too numb to cry. \n\nAt some point I managed to get over the depression and accept hopelessness.\nI accepted that I must be mentally disabled in some way. Some people are born without the ability to see, for example, while I was born without the ability to form any human connections.\n\nNow I just live hedonistically, I eat, sleep and use the internet. It‚Äôs not that bad. Giving up is peaceful. No expectations = no disappointments.",

People to go travel with, rent a cabin with, people who celebrate milestones and birthdays with you, especially for normies women - people throw them birthday parties, bridal showers etc. it‚Äôs hard not having a partner at my age (and I know a lot of normies my age spend time with their partners more than friends if they have kids) but we all know that.

Now that it's completely over I'm much happier, but looking back it's making me realize how lonely I've been/am. I was emotionally and physically neglected for years and my rock bottom self esteem just let it continue for way too long.\n\nI eventually got the courage to end things, and they agreed that the problems were unfixable. Then after a couple months they asked if I wanted to try again and work on the relationship while working on our own things as well. Can you imagine what the people pleaser who hadn't had sex in 5 years said? \n\nSo we got back together, but it quickly reverted back to the same rut. Glossing over the broad strokes, all you really need to know is I eventually had one of my friends approach me and say my partner matched with their friend on a dating app. And their profile mentioned they were moving cities too.\n\nWhoopee. I'm being cheated on and my rent is going to double!\n\nThe relationship was ending anyway, and we both knew it. I just wish I said something sooner instead of finding out this way.\n\nSo now we're still living together, and they're moving in a few months, but I've been so distracted by the breakup and my recent stupid career change that I didn't realize how empty a part of me feels.\n\nI have very close friends that make me feel loved, and the ones that matter know my whole situation sucks and will give me all the hugs and shoulders to cry on, etc... \n\nThat said, my apartment isn't free for \"visitors\" while I'm living with my ex.

This year she came to my school and we are in the same classroom we were bestfriends since last year where i got from another school because of a really toxic and bad relationship i had there . So now we are all day together because we go to afterclass activities together and we argue over petty issues constantly but our chemistry is really good and whenever we are together we laugh and have fun. Anyways she goes to ballet and she has some friends from there that lately we became friends too and we hung out. Anyways lately since she came to my school on weekends we rarely hang out . She only goes with her friends from ballet and her older school and she doesnt want to meet me her friends from older school i only saw them three years ago on a birthday party she had that i left early because she didnt talk to me. Today i asked her if she will go out and she said me she will go with her friends of her ballet while she know that i dont have any other friends because i dont go to any other activities i just go to the gym and wherever else i go i am with her and we are only together not making space for any further socialising. She also knows that i got out from a difficult relationship so i am really introvert and scared of people hurting me so i dont really make any effort to connect with people . Ghe only friends i had were two girls from school that now she had met them so whenever we go out we arrange it as a team and also they study very hard and they only go out once a week and we hadnt gone out with them since two months ago. And i dont know what to do she knows that i dont have any other person. I also reacently found out ghat i have ocd and in general i dont talk to people about any profound thing that bothers me i only talk about surface stuff, and i am really confused and i hadnt talk to anyone about my ocd only my brother knows because he has it too and he understood it but he talks to me around the bush but i know that he knows . Anyway lately i feel like that all the pressure will drive me crazy i also took up smoking and i constantly feel the need to smoke . My thoughts are driving me crazy.",

    "title": "Autism is a \"lonely\" brain.",
    "selftext": "I don‚Äôt really know where to start, so I guess I‚Äôll just say it. I‚Äôm 20 years old, autistic, and struggling to find my place in the world. My whole life, I‚Äôve felt out of sync with everyone around me, like I‚Äôm living in a reality that wasn‚Äôt designed for me. I used to think that if I tried hard enough‚Äîif I observed more, learned more, copied others better‚ÄîI‚Äôd finally figure out how to be normal. But I never did.\n\nSince starting college, everything has only gotten worse. I recently experienced a fight because people didn‚Äôt like me and mocked me for asking ‚Äúdumb questions.‚Äù That moment made me realize that my isolation isn‚Äôt just bad luck‚Äîit‚Äôs something biologically wired into my brain. Autism shapes the way I process social interactions, and no matter how much I try, I‚Äôll always struggle to connect the way neurotypical people do.\n\nIn December, I got a job I was excited about, but it ended up as another failure. I did my work perfectly, but I didn‚Äôt talk enough, and my coworkers disliked me for it. Someone even said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a Black person who doesn‚Äôt know how to talk to Black people.‚Äù And they were right‚ÄîI don‚Äôt know how to talk to anyone. I was anxious every day, unable to engage naturally. Eventually, I was let go right before New Year's, leaving me unemployed again. That feeling of being fundamentally different, of not fitting in anywhere, hit me all over again.\n\nI don‚Äôt have the energy to keep going. This isn‚Äôt a call for help‚ÄîI don‚Äôt even know what help would look like. My phone is broken from a meltdown I had yesterday. I stim, and I hate it. The only person I can talk to is myself, and I hate that too. I don‚Äôt want change. I don‚Äôt want solutions. I just want to be left alone.\n\nI‚Äôve struggled with my identity for as long as I can remember. My family is from Detroit, but growing up, they told me I wasn‚Äôt really from there. So where am I from? Is it the place I live now? Is it where I was born? What is ‚Äúhome‚Äù supposed to feel like? I don‚Äôt know where I belong. It doesn‚Äôt matter where I go; I will always be an outsider. I see how people look at me‚Äîas another person with ‚Äúmental issues,‚Äù another weirdo, another problem. Maybe that‚Äôs really all I‚Äôve ever been.\n\nMy siblings only seem to care as long as I‚Äôm \"alive in the messages.\" That‚Äôs enough for them. Nobody really cares when you‚Äôre an adult, not in a way that changes anything. It‚Äôs just easier to move on and assume things are fine as long as I respond. But I‚Äôm not fine. I‚Äôve never been fine.\n\nThe truth is, this has been building up since I was a kid. Growing up, I was teased constantly by both friends and family. The things people said stuck with me longer than they should have. When I was just a kid at the YMCA, I loved talking to people, loved engaging. Then one day, I slipped up in a conversation, misspoke, and everyone laughed at me. That embarrassment never left. It was just one of thousands of small things that built up over time, turning into severe social anxiety and trauma.\n\nIn sixth grade, I ran away from school often. Mr. Tarper,  my mental health counselor, my mom, my teachers, my family, my friends, my peers, my enemies all used to mention the differences about me which deeply affected my self-esteem. His words, along with all the other humiliations I endured, shaped my identity in ways I didn‚Äôt even realize at the time. I was so easily humiliated that even small moments of embarrassment felt unbearable. They still do.\n\nI‚Äôve tried to fix myself. I‚Äôve read books‚ÄîDale Carnegie, Peter Vermeulen‚Äîtried to learn new communication techniques, practiced eye contact, voice control, pacing. I‚Äôve studied people, learned their mannerisms, tried to mimic their confidence. It never works. No matter how much I try, my interactions always feel unnatural. Forced. And people can tell. It makes them uncomfortable, and that just makes me retreat further.\n\nLooming anxiety is the only thing that keeps me alive. It‚Äôs not motivation, it‚Äôs not hope‚Äîit‚Äôs just fear. Fear of what happens if I stop moving. Fear of disappointing the few people who might still care. Fear of what it means to fully give up. That fear is the only thing keeping me tethered to reality.\n\nI‚Äôve never been okay, and I don‚Äôt think I ever will be. But I don‚Äôt want pity. I don‚Äôt want advice. I don‚Äôt want anyone to reach out. I just wanted to put this somewhere, to say it out loud in a place where maybe, just maybe, someone will understand what it feels like to be me.",

I don't know how or whether to share these things, but ignoring them or dealing with them alone like I used to is starting to interfere.\n\nI feel needy or a burden if I think about just dumping or sharing my feelings.  And then the little things start.  I'm usually the one to message her goodnight or goodmorning.  I'm starting to feel bad about being the one to initiate often, then maybe think she's ok with her own space.  So I've started cutting back a bit on it just to see if she'd carry a bit of the impetus, but now I'm worried whether she'd then think I'm drifting away or that she'd expect them now.  She did surprise me with a call on a day after I didn't text those little things and she was very busy the day before, but she had to end early as she was doing things.  Again, that's a bit part of the long distance and time zones.  Usually she's busy with day things when I'm on night hours so it's hard to line up that energy or conversation.  On the other hand I'm stuck with my shitty feelings and it just adds to it if I feel I can neither share it nor be happy with her on chat and send sweet messages.  Oh and usually when I initiate she's responds well, but reciprocating is different than initiating, so I'm concerned in that department.\n\nJust feel a bit stuck.  I've been used to my state of loneliness and solitude for so long that I'm struggling to handle or knowing how to being not.  Back to the title, does one share how they're feeling when not prompted directly or asked 'How Are You?'.  When you're lonely there's not so much option than to just try to shoulder on.  Now that there's someone, I'm afraid of being needy, and I'm afraid of my shit affecting how I am with them normally, since I'm not feeling I'm getting an opportunity to share the shit getting me down nor much deliberate rather than passing attention.  I feel like my natural reaction now is to dial down and wait for some sign of effort on their part.  Not sure if it's right, but as someone familiar with solitude beforehand, it seems more instinctually safe than overstepping with sharing too much.  ",

    "selftext": "1.) I never got approached by guys in real life and they seem to avoid me. Sometimes they look or even stare and often they don't even see me and I'm invisible. Whenever I went out with another girls, they got approached, while they didn't really look at me or greeted me. Sometimes I get unfriendly, disgusted looks from them. Yet no one harassed me and some were very polite (helping me collect my money after it fell down, holding doors open, never coming too near to me,...)\n\nEither that's a sign that I'm very ugly and they don't want to talk to me and sometimes have those looks on their faces, because they're disgusted by me (I don't know why, as I take care of myself and look normal in my opinion). OR it's a sign that I'm very attractive and they consider me above their league, so they don't approach me and even try to make me feel bad with the way they act / look at me sometimes, so I would lose confidence and think I'm beliw them.\n\n2.) When I posted selfies, they sometimes went viral, but mostly got hate comments (about 90% was hate) and mostly by men.\n\nEither it only went viral because it was coincidence and was only pushed because of its hate comments and people tried to make fun of my looks because I'm ugly (several people used my face as example of \"ugly\" and posted what it would look like with certain makeup or surgery). OR it means that I'm so pretty that people were jealous, even men who knew they has no chance and therefore were projecting and trying to make me feel bad again.\n\n3.) No one seems to truly like me, even platonic. Got mostly chosen the last in sports teams, people in my surroundings sometimes were cute to me and sometimes were passive-aggressive to me for no apparent reason. Mostly people only wanted to befriend me because they saw benefits (better grades mostly or a therapist-friend). Somd guy friends (had male friends seldomly, gladly) wanted something different than a friendship and some of the female friends were talking badly behind my back, tried to put me down for the way I look and mostly tried to hide it behind \"jokes\". Some would also take photos together, but without me and when they do, they would laugh about the way I look, which I never get, because I looked completely normal in my opinion. About 3 of them also spread a rumor about me when I was in 6th grade.\n\nThis could either mean that people are very jealous of me and therefore dislike me and that the male friends thought I would be easy to get due to being unattractive OR that they disliked me because I don't fit a certain beauty standard (and as we know, society is very shallow) and because the guy friends can't be truly friends with girls they perceive as attractive.\n\n4.) When we had a teacher that everyone said about that he based the girls grades on how good they're looking, all of the girls got a much better grade than they deserved, except for me, who even got a worse grade than I should have had.\n\nEither it means I was the ugly duckling in class or the teacher just thought of me as unsympathetic person because I had no friends in class and perhaps seemed arrogant because of that, as I also wasn't shy and others claimed as well that I'm good at speaking infront of others and appear self-assured.\n\n5.) I occasionally get compliments. Mostly for my eyes, sometimes for my hair or what I wear. What I get compliments for almost as often as for my eyes, is how good I'm at drawing.\n\nEither thoss compliments are serious or they are out of pity.\n\nI have more signs, but those are the top 5 ones (especially the first 3!)\n\nHope someone can help telling me what would be more rational to think. I always considered myself as average, but my experiences don't seem to be average, so I'm not sure anymore. I won't use dating apps and I won't show what I look like, as it's always the same.\n\n\nFOR CLARIFICATION:\n- The post is about how others perceive me, not about how I perceive myself. In my eyes, I look totally normal. \n- The point of this post is to rate my attractiveness level based on my experience only! (So don't ask about pics of me!) -> Question in the post here is: Do you think those experiences would rather apply to an attractive or unattractive person?\n- I can deal with brutal honesty, so only comment if your intention is to be real instead of comforting (in case those are bad news)",

The years have passed like a whisper, but the weight of this hollow partnership grows louder every day. We built a life together, but the foundation was never love‚Äîit was convenience. A choice made because it seemed easier than facing the unknown alone.\n\nI am not alone in the traditional sense; there is always someone there. But I‚Äôve never felt more isolated. My days are filled with routine, small talk, and the appearance of stability. The outside world sees a picture-perfect marriage, but inside, I feel like a ghost haunting my own life.\n\nI envy those who wake up next to someone they truly love, who can look across the room and feel their heart race. I look across the room and see a stranger I‚Äôve known for over a decade. We share a house, but not a home. A bed, but not intimacy. Words, but not understanding.\n\nI tell myself this is enough‚Äîafter all, isn‚Äôt this what adulthood is? Compromise? Settling? Yet deep down, I ache for something real, something that feels like the sun on my face after a storm.\n\nI‚Äôm 39 and running out of time to find it. But how do you leave a life you built for something as fragile and fleeting as love? How do you step into the unknown when all you‚Äôve known is safe but empty?\n\nI feel like I‚Äôm screaming into a void, hoping someone out there hears me. I don‚Äôt even know what I want anymore, but I know it isn‚Äôt this. Does anyone else feel this way? Or am I just hopelessly adrift, wishing for something that doesn‚Äôt exist?",

    "selftext": "I am sitting in a train, people living in front of me. My heart is twisted, my guts full of emptiness. A sharp ray of void radiates through my arms. It happens almost everyday now. I am feeling lonely.\n\nDuring all my life, I have never had any significant problem or difficulty, quite the opposite in fact. I grew up in a favourable environment, I knew it and enjoyed it while it lasted. I was an happy child. Still now, I have managed to graduate from one of the best institutions in what people would consider a demanding curriculum, and am pursuing advanced studies. I bury my head in knowledge and intellectualism. I seem so different from the horrifying experiences testified here. \n\n\"You seem so clever.\" I never know how to answer this. Be it true or false, it's seen as a blessing and a curse. Blessing to be able to understand and appreciate a lot with curiosity, curse because finding someone who likes to talk frequently about deep topics is a selective criteria. \"It looks like you have a diverse skillset\" As a consequence of curiosity and loneliness, I spend my free time learning hobbies and skills. It's personally satisfying but it makes me want someone who is also truly curious and openminded, which I rarely met for now. I have so much to share yet no one to receive.\n\nPeople appear to appreciate my presence. I have a small number of very good friends. They all pursued their life far from here. I may even be a good memory for some, as they reach out years later for news. Last week, I met a acquaintance from years ago who was happy to see me. She was well-dressed and perfumed. I might be relevant to someone. The happiness she seemed to feel relieved me for a few hours. (Lesbian people are the best I know) However those rare moments never make up for the daily burden.\n\n\"You should put yourself out there, there are a lot of girls craving for a guy like you\" \"You are great, you deserve so much love\" \"If I was straight, I would be jealous of your future partner\" My friends all seem to agree that I have all it takes to be a great boyfriend. Agreed, the only thing lacking is a girlfriend to enjoy it. How come not one girl seemed to find those traits valuable?\n\nI know how to break the ice to make friends, be it men or women or anything else, yet I don't know how to transform this into being in couple. I am not so good socially, especially when the situation feels new to me. I use humour and irony to make it smoother. It seems to work. I value all genders equally, but seduction feels like considering the other one as a goal, which does not make me comfortable. Also charm and spell are synonyms, and \"I put a spell on you\" mean that you have to use magic to make someone love you. This does not look fair, I do not want to trick someone into loving me, considering her as less human than me. I want someone who considers me worthy of their love and who I consider worthy of mine.\n\nI like being alone. Interacting with people is so tiring. Freedom is one of my main values. I don't judge and don't want to be judged. Living all my life alone is not possible either to me. I have so much love, knowledge and experience to share. I feel an urge of loving someone to share all that I buried inside. That's the only way it can become really valuable. Being rich or social status are good but superficial. Sharing is what matters. Knowing that someone profoundly desires me, values me, everyday from dawn to dusk is all I wish.\n\nThe loneliness and the urge of love sometimes transforms me. I am sensitive but very rational, yet I posted on this site dumb and desperate ads to meet someone, to experience this touch, this semblance of romantic love I never had. Hopefully, I stopped whenever it felt risky. I met some people, and when it was close to happening, it did not feel right and I stopped everything. I was not myself. This made up situations caused me anxiety. Even in those prepared scenario, I was lost, I didn't know what to say, what to do to make the other person feel truly considered. I can only imagine how worse it would be in a unprepared case with someone I would have organically met, and that I valued even more.\n\nThe only experiences I had were rejection, and a lot of false hopes. It made me afraid of dating, getting genuinely attached to someone so fast only to realise soon after that finally it was not reciprocical. The harsher ones made me feel less than human, but as everything, time passes and we seem to forget, but deep down it leaves a mark. I never felt genuinely loved in dating.\n\nThose thoughts seem absurd, but I don't forget what Camus teached me; that the world is not absurd by itself, it's our relationship with it that is, because it never answers our human questions. So I don't address those reflections to the world, but to myself; or to you, if you accept them. \n\nThe train is still rolling, people are still living, and a tear is flowing.",

I‚Äôve craved a relationship for the last few months but it‚Äôs hard for me to feel connected to someone and not cold or it goes south because I‚Äôm being lusted over. I don‚Äôt know how to overcome this. I know it‚Äôs just a matter of time until I find a good friendship or relationship but I‚Äôm tired. I‚Äôm tired of going through date and vetting people for it to fail 80% of the time anyways. It‚Äôs just exhausting I don‚Äôt really date anymore but I don‚Äôt know what to do. Hobbies help ofc but u can only distract yourself so much until u feel the need for a genuine connection.(friends or relationship) i have a few friends but im not close to anyone of them. Half of the time they don‚Äôt even respond to me n im initiating a lot of the hangouts. What do you guys advise? How do you find the people who make u feel heard or a connection. I know I‚Äôm young but it‚Äôs been like this for years already and it hasn‚Äôt gotten better. Thanks for reading.",

    "selftext": "In just some few minutes, it'll be my birthday. I've been sulking for the last few hours, dreading the day and anticipating when it'll finally be over. It's just a reminder that I have nobody in my life to celebrate with, and it's been that way for almost a decade.\n\nI'm a university student. Came in with big hopes; everyone feeds you the idea of this period being a \"fresh start\" and \"the best years of your life.\" Now more than ever, I'm reminded of my worst years from secondary school when I was just as lonely and would spend whatever time I could in empty classrooms until I went home. I've always watched people interact from afar and be overwhelmed by envy because they have every single trait I don't. It's no different now. In fact, I think because of how open this environment is, I find these feelings amplified tenfold when I see friend groups laughing with each other, couples holding hands, anything that resembles positive human interaction.\n\nMy mental health has totally plummeted. My social anxiety has become much more severe, I'm in the midst of a heavy depressive episode, and I'm currently seeing a therapist who believes I have some kind of personality disorder. Despite that, I've been trying to make an effort this year to put myself out there a little more after last year, when I couldn't even make it to class without having a panic attack. Thing is, I'm conventionally unattractive. People don't want to approach me or talk to me, nor do they appreciate it when I try to approach them. It genuinely feels like everyone's repelled from me; the fact that it's happened throughout all these years has to mean that it's a personal problem. I don't look good, I don't talk right, I don't act right. It demotivates you from even bothering to try because nothing will come of it.\n\nPeople's advice to me has always been to keep trying. I'm too afraid to do that because I know they won't like me for many of the reasons I mentioned above. I've gotten over hypotheticals. There's always someone better that they're chasing. If I keep people at a distance, I won't get attached to them and swoon over them like the pitifully desperate person I am. This was learned from prior experiences, confirmed by ones that happened a few months ago (you know, losing everyone you naively believed to be your friend in a heartbeat, having people stop talking you for no apparent reason, etc.). I think that if anyone suddenly came into my life and was the slightest bit kind to me, I'd end up in a self-destructive pattern just to keep them in my life. It's happened before, and I've recently had strong urges to experience something like this again. To ruin my life for the temporary thrill of it. I hate myself for this. But all I can do when talking to myself, myself being the only person I ever open my mouth to, is cycle through these manic ups and downs. It's my fault for isolating myself but there's only so much you can do before you give up.\n\nI just want to be normal. For once I strive to be just an average person. The average person is likeable. The average person does not burst into tears when they overhear someone asking their friend how their day was in the most sincere tone they've ever heard. The average person doesn't fear being perceived while simultaneously hopelessly craving attention, begging to be noticed. The average person actually knows what they are. All I could ever say is I'm a person. A lonely, uninteresting, miserable person.\n\nI just wanted to get this off my chest before the clock strikes 12 and I repeat the same day for the umpteenth time. Maybe this will be the year when I finally settle with the idea that loneliness is secretly a blessing, or whatever that nonsense phrase is.",

Forced even. \n\nI was so confident and full of beans before college. But I was severely bullied in High School. Ever since, I haven't even truly opened my heart to any friendships. Even with my closer friends in the past, I've never felt fully at ease and the friendships always fizzle out eventually. I have no problem with my partners.. this is just a problem in friendships. \n\nOr is this just adulthood? Everyone too busy to maintain friendships? Are friendships just a thing of school times?

But after my lectures, I went to my school‚Äôs student advocacy center to ask about their mental health therapy services. I managed to sign up and schedule an intake appointment for next Wednesday. \n\nI‚Äôve actually been in therapy before. My high school had this free therapy service for students who need it, and I signed up for weekly appointments during my sophomore and senior year (I skipped junior year cause I was far too busy with my classes). By the time I left senior year, my therapist was adamant about me continuing my therapy in college. She also wants me to get diagnosed, but I unfortunately don‚Äôt have the money for that‚Ä¶ At the very least, I‚Äôm going back to therapy, and hopefully, I can see what they can do for me. \n\nWhether they‚Äôll improve my condition for long-term, I‚Äôm not really sure. If those two years in high school did no change on my psyche, then I don‚Äôt know if the one in my college will do any different.

There‚Äôs something about the long nights, the gray skies, and the biting cold that seems to amplify the absence of connection. When the world slows down and the days are shorter, the silence feels endless. It‚Äôs in those quiet moments‚Äîwhen others are busy celebrating or cozying up with loved ones‚Äîthat I feel the weight of my loss the most.\n\nIt‚Äôs been eight years since my best friend since i was 8 years old (iam in my 30s now)took his own life, and even now, the memories of him linger in every corner of my mind. I see him in the snowdrifts, in the shadows cast by the flickering streetlights. I hear his voice in the stillness, a faint echo of his laugh or some witty remark he‚Äôd have made about the absurdity of it all. Losing him has left a hole that nothing has been able to fill.\n\nI think about the way we used to endure winter together, two restless spirits chasing whatever adventure we could find to keep the cold from settling in our bones. He had a way of making even the bleakest days seem lighter, his humor cutting through the gloom like a sharp beam of sunlight. But now, winter feels more like a reminder‚Äîa stark, unyielding symbol of the void he left behind.\n\nWhat haunts me most isn‚Äôt just the loss of him, but the questions I‚Äôll never have answers to. The ‚Äúwhat-ifs‚Äù play on an endless loop: What if I had called him that night? What if I‚Äôd been a better friend? What if I could‚Äôve stopped him from slipping so far into the darkness? These thoughts don‚Äôt go away with time; they just settle deeper, becoming part of me.\n\nI carry him with me through every season, but in winter, his absence feels sharper, more defined. I miss him every day, but during these cold months, it feels like he‚Äôs just out of reach, like I could turn a corner and find him there, grinning, waiting to share some absurd story or sarcastic insight. But of course, he‚Äôs not.\n\nAnd that‚Äôs the hardest part‚Äîknowing he never will be again.",

I have none of this. When I get home, I usually stare at the walls and to avoid this I go to the gym where I do my workouts alone before heading to bed...\n\nI have 5 very close friends that I've kept since high school. I'm the only single dude in our crew and since we're getting older I totally understand that they prioritize spending time with their wives/girlfriends/kids etc. We do see each other from time to time to catch up, but it's not like back in our high school days where we hung out everyday.\n\nI recently went to my best friend birthday party, he's married and lives with his wife. We used to go to the club together and get beers after exams back in university. I felt very happy for him and I feel bad writing this, but the sight of him living with someone who cares and values him and plenty of friends made me very envious. Similarly, my business partner constantly keeps posting stories on Instagram of him and his wife, his child, his friends at events like he has an exciting life. \n\nLast time I made plans with some people from university for a barbecue, only 3 people showed up out of our group of 10. I felt like shit.\n\nAt work we celebrate employees' birthdays. My birthday is in less than a month, and everyone at work forgot about it, I'm not even in the calendar. I just feel like I'm garbage.\n\nWhen I opened my own business, no one, not even my family, cheered me up or organized a celebration for me. Same thing when I bought my first property. Going to the notary felt like a normal Monday while for most people this would be a major celebration in their lives. It's not that I don't want to celebrate, It's that no one cares about me enough (not even family) to organize something or give me a call.\n\nI'm currently dating a girl, but she's very distant. It's been a month and we haven't even kissed yet. She takes forever to reply to my messages, and when we meet I drive her around and pay for everything without any sign of gratitude from her. Even worse, she keeps looking at her phone while on a date with me. I don't even know if I want to keep this relationship going on.\n\nMy life is just plain boring and I have nothing to look forward to. Nobody gives a single shit if I'm successful or not. Nobody cares enough about me to make plans with me, travel with me, or cheer me up when I win. \n\nI'm beginning to believe that, after all, maybe I'm just garbage and I deserve the life I have.\n\n  \n",

When I see people hanging out, couples or general friends. I do feel happy for them. I truly do, but when reality kicks and I realise I won‚Äôt have that luxury thing and I don‚Äôt know why I feel. I don‚Äôt fit in this generation man. I‚Äôm so fuc*ed up. When I see people talking about their partners or the things experiences, they have the partners like going out on trips and stuff I feel I‚Äôll never have that in my life and sometimes I wish to lie when people ask me about if I have someone in life , a gf.

It‚Äôs not like I have not been approached in life. I do get approached by some girls, but it‚Äôs mainly hollow, because they only approach me for my height since I 6‚Äô2.

Because the moment they approach me or I see them in my mind, I‚Äôm thinking if they have ever been in a relationship or kind of stuff, which I do not want in my life because let‚Äôs face subconsciously EVERYONE COMPARES. They will compare how you are different from their previous partner/ex or how do you do certain amount of things in life? How you deal with your situations and this is just something which is absolutely not for me. I mean, I want to be there first in life.

    "title": "23 M, Feel invisible to women and like the world is \"cold\" to me",
    "selftext": "This may be long post, but I wanted to be thorough to ensure a more complete picture of the situation.\n\nBit about myself: I grew up in a relatively rural area in the US, but was fortunate to get recruited as an athlete at an elite university, where I had a stem major and graduated top of my class. I'm tall, athletic and would say decent looking (6-7/10) but certainly nothing that women would really swoon over for looks alone. To give a sense of general personality, I took the Myer briggs personality test and I'm basically split 50/50 between INTJ and ENTJ. I rarely went to parties/drank and mostly focused on my academics and career, but maybe too much at the cost of not establishing a solid friend network or having a girlfriend at the current moment upon graduating and feeling pretty isolated/lonely. The limited friends I do have, including few girls, would say that I'm overall ambitious, caring to those close to me and speak my mind directly, but try to be kind and respectful in the process.\n\nRecently, I've been having episodes with feeling a combination of sadness, jealously, and bitterness whenever I think about my ex or open up instagram and see a happy couple or a girl complain how there aren't enough \"good\" men to find. I have always done my best to respect women and learn from my mistakes, despite failed situationships and casual dating when I was younger earlier in college. However, things changed when I had my first relationship and found a girl that I thought was perfect for me back in 2022. We were together for about 10 months, but the relationship ended because of the stress we were both under with school and our careers. Neither of us made enough time for each other. Toward the end, I felt like I wasn‚Äôt receiving much care or affection, though I loved her deeply. I tried to chalk it up to her being overwhelmed, along with some immature mistakes I made (though there was no cheating, abuse, or manipulation involved on my end). After the breakup, I didn‚Äôt handle things well and ended up rebounding with someone else a few weeks later. Out of guilt, I was honest about this with my ex, and while she seemed okay with it on the surface (we even kissed again), I left that encounter feeling devastated. I loved her and knew I wasn‚Äôt over her.\n\nThat summer, I worked on myself‚Äîlost 20 lbs, built muscle, and reflected on the mistakes I made during the relationship. I wanted to learn and grow, and I genuinely believed that, with time, we could reconcile. In the fall, I reached out to her via email, asking for a quick 5-minute chat about ‚Äúus,‚Äù but she declined, saying she was too busy. I tried to focus on moving forward, but it became harder when I heard through mutual friends that she was on Hinge. That stung. I couldn‚Äôt understand why she wouldn‚Äôt even have a brief conversation with me. To make matters worse, she blocked me on every platform (even Venmo and LinkedIn). I tried not to overthink it, but the lingering questions about what went wrong haunted me.\n\nOn Valentine‚Äôs Day, I texted her asking if she was seeing anyone, and she said yes. That hit me like a truck. My mental health spiraled and would go on hours walks around the city tearing up, and I spent weeks and months questioning everything‚Äîwhether I was good enough, attractive enough, or worthy of love. I also knew she had broken up with a long-time friend in the past because she stopped finding him \"physically attractive,\" which made me even more insecure about my own looks. In moments of desperation, I emailed her a few times since then apologizing for my mistakes and asking why she wanted nothing to do with me. She eventually broke up with the guy she had been dating, but she never reached out to me. Recently, I found out through friends that she‚Äôs back on Hinge, and it‚Äôs been nearly two years since we broke up. I stopped going on dating apps altogether a while ago because I figured it was making my mental health worse and was a terrible way to fill the gap with the breakup, not to mention I don't want to lead anyone on or hurt anyone through my maladaptive coping. She's still my only relationship to this day.\n\nI feel more hurt now than ever and would do almost anything to be with her again. I know people will say she‚Äôs not worth it, or that I need to move on, but to me, she‚Äôs everything I‚Äôve ever wanted: smart, ambitious, kind to everyone, curious, and beautiful. She complemented my personality in a way no one else has. What‚Äôs killing me is the fear that I‚Äôll never find someone like her again. I don‚Äôt know what to do‚Äîshould I work on becoming more attractive (plastic surgery has crossed my mind), change who I am, or just resign myself to being alone? I feel stuck, and I don‚Äôt know how to move forward. I feel like I don't recognize the person I dated before and feel like the world around me in general has become much colder despite the painful lessons I learned and tried to improve from.\n\nAny advice would mean a lot.

I also have a solid friend group and people I can hang out with, but despite that, I often feel an overwhelming sense of loneliness.\n\nEven though I appreciate my friends, I find myself longing for a deeper connection‚Äîa significant other or romantic partner with whom I can share my life. I‚Äôve fallen into a cycle of downloading dating apps like Hinge, chatting with random girls, and hoping something meaningful will come out of it. Unfortunately, it rarely does. I keep asking myself, *will having a romantic relationship fix everything?*\n\nI feel like my automatic response to emotional struggles is, *just get into a relationship, and everything will be okay.* Maybe it‚Äôs the need to feel wanted or the desire for intimacy, but deep down, I know I need to address this differently.

I‚Äôve been in that situation all the time. It‚Äôs never fun. \n\n‚ÄúDo something for yourself! Treat yourself, buy yourself something, to cheer you up! Don‚Äôt just sit around and hate on loving couples!‚Äù: \n\nOh 1000%. I always do that. It‚Äôs what gets me through, or the very least makes me feel like I am living. Doesn‚Äôt fully take away the feelings of loneliness that I have surrounding this time but makes it better. \n\nTrust me. I am goddamn trying. I am not loafing around posting how much I hate it. I‚Äôm trying to make it better and tolerable. But it still hurts. \n\nHonestly, why are we even celebrating a holiday when we can be showing love on the daily?? I personally want it gone forever. I feel that without that reminder of how things are going on in my life, I can work on improving myself better. \n\nI don‚Äôt need anyone telling me that I am bitter for genuinely feeling alone despite trying to make this time better.

On the flip side: I have zero friends, I torpedoed my long term relationship with my bf months ago, and no matter how hard I try, I cannot find seem to find anybody who wants to be around me. \n\nWhen I meet new people I just so often get the vibe that they have no interest in me as a person. This may just be confirmation bias but nobody reaches out. Nobody asks for my instagram. Nobody that I do know gets excited when I call them (70% of the time my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù don‚Äôt answer, and 0% of the time do they call back). I‚Äôm nobody‚Äôs best friend but god do I want to be‚Ä¶..\n\nAt a point you have to accept that you are the problem but I really don‚Äôt know what to do to fix the problem. Therapy has been impossible. I want to put myself out there and sometimes try‚Ä¶.but living in the same city for 6 years (and committed for at least 2 more), I just don‚Äôt know what to do. I get so anxious with apps like meetup because I just think people will find it so odd that i‚Äôve lived here for so long and have literally no friends. I feel it creeps people out and lying is impossible because it‚Äôs so easy to find out i‚Äôve been here for a long time. \n\nI don‚Äôt know what to do and I hate being here. Honestly I feel like such a loser writing this but I know all of us in here probably do.\n\nMaybe you can relate, maybe you have advice, idk‚Ä¶‚Ä¶I just needed to get this off my chest and I literally have nobody else to say this to.i",

Like for example, let's say that I'm a normal person who hanged out with other people, and when my school years are over, I decide to live my life by being alone and doing my own things. Is that normal? I've seen other people on this subreddit saying that they've wasted my life by not being around people, but as a loner, I don't feel like I'm wasting my life by not socializing because I love doing my own things. I know I can live my life whatever way I want but I'm just worried that there will be regrets if I live that way.

I was fine with that, how else did she think it'd be? Then, the day we were supposed to meet up, she texted me at 1 AM to cancel because \"her grandmother fell and broke her femur.\" \n\n  \nI knew exactly what game she was trying to play, so instead of letting it go I said \"oh i'm sorry to hear that, I hope her **hip** isn't broken.\" I purposefully did this about five more times and waited for her to correct me -- she didn't.

As we got older, we began to become distant, especially me. I was enveloped in the world of gaming, but although they were too, it consumed me because of my horrible homelife and emotionally abusive alcoholic father and absent mother. I began becoming increasingly socially awkward around 5th grade and the transition to middle school was horrible. I became the weird kid, stopped hanging out with my friends, and spent all my time online. I've never been a horrible looking dude as I used to get attention from girls as a young kid, but I aged horribly since I have a condition that makes my face very asymmetric which was purely environmental, and my nose was also broken twice. I basically went zero-contact with other people by the time I hit 8th or 9th grade and my life was spent online. Anyways, I narrowly graduated and got a job, and not long after had facial reconstructive surgery which left me looking worse due to a botched operation. Since then, at every job I've had I've been the outcast. The weird looking, creepy pariah who is painfully socially awkward. The guy you think would either come into work one day with a gun, commit a heinous weird crime like se\\*\\*\\* assault, I don't know. Even after multiple customer service jobs I've been unable to improve my social skills. I've been able to mask better, but the facade falls the longer somebody gets to know me. I yearn for attention, I want to be loved and validated, and I've had small moments of that which were ripped away from me and make me feel even worse. I feel like I'm an alien who will live out his days spectating others' as they grow and become happy with their lives, and I'll be left behind and end up dying of alcoholism like my dad which has already almost happened.",

I tried to ask my coach for a break, but it‚Äôs not possible due to the qualifications required for nationals.

But he had a small yet reliable group of friends.\n\nWell at the start of this semester, they all decided to cut him off for stupid drama (the 'leader' of the group had a crush on him and was mad that I was with him, so they gave the rest of the group an ultimatum). So now he has pretty much no friends in college.\n\nHe's trying to stay strong, but it's really upsetting him. He broke down in tears in front of me for the first time today, sharing how worthless he felt. I used to feel just like him. I have spent many years of my life completely friendless and alone.\n\nHe tries to stay positive, and says he's going to try harder to socialize and meet new people, but I just can't stand to see him in pain like this. I already have enough mental issues going on, but the thought of him being in that horrible, lonely, friendless position we have all felt here makes me so upset.\n\nWhat can I do? Hugging him and supporting him doesn't feel like enough.",

    "selftext": "Hi this is my first time posting and I just wanted some opinions on this situation. I have a friend group of 3 people. This all started this summer, basically I have strict parents so i can't go out everyday and can't stay very late at night when I go out, meanwhile my friends can do these things . So during the summer they all would spend time together all the time and even though they would invite me they never put into consideration my limitations with time, they would never call me or text me when before summer we used to facetime everyday ( all 3 of us because one of our friends lives away) and when that friend came in town they didn't facetious with me anymore( since sometimes i couldn't go out I wanted still to talk to them) . Anyway summer passed and they still never call me or text me our only communication is when we're in school, when we go out and I tell them that I can't do everything they do ( because of my strict parents) I see in they're face some annoyance and I feel like I hold them back a lot. Another thing is this summer I can't go on vacations with them ( we went last year together) and I told them that I  can't come and they still are planning to go without me , the way our relationship is that if one can't come we aren't going at all that's how it's always done with us and the fact that they are considering and planning  to go without me hurt me so bad. And today I asked one of my friends if I'm annoying and she said \"yes sometimes you are\" which really hurt me again and makes me think more that they don't really miss my presence when I'm not around. I don't know what to do honestly these days I've distanced myself a bit and trying not to bother them as much. The thing is that they're my only friends and I've never felt more lonely in my life , I also have talked to them about my feeling and that I feel a bit left out ( about a month ago I told them before the vacation thing) and they never changed the way they were acting or tried to reassure me that it's not the way I think. So I don't know what to do anymore. Any thoughts or suggestions?",

    "selftext": "I have felt lonely most of my life. I have always had people around me, but never felt seen. I usually feel like if I wasn't there, no one would notice, or it wouldn't make any difference to them and their life. No one has ever really taken true interest in me and it makes me feel so alone sometimes that I want to die. I am F(24), and I have felt this way for as long as I can remember. Due to some trauma from when I was a child, I feel like people only think you are good for what you can give them or bring to their life. I don't think most people see me as a human being or someone who would want to be loved like they do. I feel like everyone just wants something from me. And no matter how much I give and give, it will never be enough. I shut down years ago, and a lot of times feel numb and lack enjoyment in the things that usually make me happy (I know that's depression). I am constantly anxious and fearing the worst will happen (I know that's anxiety). I have tried different medications and hated it (they either don't work or make me feel numb).  At the end of the day, I feel like I'm not meant to feel anything other then lonely for the rest of my life. I don't hate myself or have trouble enjoying my own company, but just being by myself is not enough. I want connection and support. I want quality time and devotion. I want family, and friendship, and love. I don't even need a village just 2 or 3 people would be enough. I don't even remember most of my childhood because my mind blocked out the pain. I don't think enough people talk about just how much loneliness hurts. I just don't want this pain anymore. I feel like I am going crazy and I don't know how to connect to people properly because I have been by myself for so long. I feel like someone in a room full of people screaming and no one will even look up. I'm so lonely and feel hopeless that sometimes life doesn't feel worth living. I just want it to end, more than anything, I want this feeling to end. Sometimes I think loneliness probably kills just as much as any terminal disease. I don't expect advice or help from this thread, I honestly don't know what I expect at this point in time. I just needed to put it out there into the void I guess.  ",

But seriously something has got to be wrong with society if I am alone at the grand old age of 20. It's got to be the phones a blessing and a curse in disguise. It makes us more connected than ever yet it still feels more apt to send people a hand written letter by carrier pigeon than send someone a message and not get a response on the same day? Not even a hello? I don't know what happened to society. Is it the illusion of choice that has left us thinking that there will always be someone? In the past community really existed people were excited to leave the house and they only really had their neighbours and town/city as their companions usually for life. But all my friends have left me and it's not even like they said goodbye. Just one day they stopped talking to me. It's a luxury to have someone text me first, I was tired of always being the first to text and I stopped doing it and overtime everyone faded. I have one friend left the only reason our friendship is so strong is because we've known eachother since we were 4 and he's autistic so he finds it hard to make new friends. He also never uses his phone to talk to people. I honestly wish more people would care or reach out to me. I'm not a bad person I've always tried to make others happy and support my friends when the moment called. I'm not a people pleaser but I'm not nasty either. The whole situation makes me feel deflated and I just don't know where to find new people to meet. Everyone wants to be online or party or do drugs but I just want a calm chat by a river with a buddy. I tend to get on better with older people, others my age thought this was weird but older people are more mature and emotionally understanding I find. Yes, everyone is selfish to some degree, afterall if you weren't your life wouldn't go anywhere without own self progress, It seems like many of my friends were just so self-indulgent In their own lives they forgot about those who used to be there for them and are still one text message away...",

I have been wanting to get this off my chest for a while now. I have been unemployed for the last 3 months, and it feels like my life has been incrementally getting worse since the last year. \n\nStarting off, I have been trying to find a girlfriend for over a year now. I am a skinny 1st gen immigrant male under 6', which is unfavorable in the American dating scene. So I tried to bulk up and exercise more. But work got so much in the way that 14-hour workdays became regular and I couldn't consistently keep up with exercise. As a result, I started to lose muscle mass. That made me disappointed but hey at least I was working towards a lot of money. In the meantime, I sort of gave up and did not actively engage with dating apps so the chances of meeting someone went to nil. However, I picked up two new hobbies (one personal and one social, made some new friends) but they were too dispersed and infrequent to help with my mental state. Still, my inner over-achieving self was telling me, all this hard work and grind are for a reason as I will be making a big bonus at the end of the year.\n\nThen shit hit the fan. My work product started suffering at the halfway point of the year. Because unknowingly to myself I used to get thoughts like what's the point of all of this since I have no one to share it with and no kids. Apparently, this had seeped into my behavior and there was a noticeable dip in my work results. My boss noted my mistakes and gave me a warning. So I took a vacation with my family to refresh which helped out in the next 2 months. But then my workload went back to what it was in the 1st half of the year and my manager finally lost faith in me as I was only operating on a limited level and not suited to handle increased responsibilities. I was terminated and won't be receiving my big bonus. I have been searching in this dour market for the last 3 months (those who know, know how the job market is right now). \n\nAnd it all came to a head last night. I had gone out with my neighbor briefly (two dates). We connected well but we had a disagreement and just drifted away after that. I forgot about her and dated a few more but those were all very superficial. But last night, because our walls are so thin, I heard sounds of my neighbor having a \"good time\" with someone. I felt disgusted with myself when at the end of the 14-month period where I told myself that I was making myself better, I had no job, no girlfriend, no deep friendship, no big bonus, and no gains. On the outside, I still pose as an optimistic, confident guy but I am barely holding together at this point. WTF is my life worth living for anymore?",

The main thing I‚Äôve noticed here (besides not really wanting friends but romantic relationships instead), is that people want friends, but when I‚Äôve talked to them, they have been very dry. I think that is the bulk of the problem from people I‚Äôve talked to here.\n\nThat‚Äôs all, feel free to ignore, have a good day :D",

    "selftext": "Me (39m) has been married 11 years to my wife (33f). We two kids together. \n\nI‚Äôve spent those 11 years revolving my life are my family. I gave up friends. I gave up hobbies. I‚Äôve worked 100 hours a week for nearly all 11 years in an effort to give my family a decent life. During that time, my wife was diagnosed with lupus, she can‚Äôt work full time, and part time jobs earned money she said was ‚Äúfor her‚Äù. \n\nI‚Äôm not here to discuss that. \n\nBut, I‚Äôve noticed distance lately. The other night she thought she was alone on the fist floor of our home. She didn‚Äôt know I had come downstairs. I stood next to her for nearly 30 seconds, as she texted some other guy. After she saw me there, it was everything you think. She immediately closed the app. I held my hand out and said ‚Äúlet me see‚Äù. She deleted the conversation right in front of me. Then told me she wasn‚Äôt texting anyone. \n\nThe next few days, she went to work at agency jobs she chose, on the other side of the state (not normal). She‚Äôd tell me her shift is 8 hours long, then text me and say she‚Äôs making it a 10, then a 12, then a 16 hour shift. \n\nWe fought over text. Her telling me I‚Äôm crazy and controlling. Me telling her I literally saw you texting, saw you delete it, saw your reaction. \n\nAnyhow. I believe I‚Äôm filing for divorce tomorrow. She‚Äôs being cold and distant. She‚Äôs left the kids at home, saying she‚Äôs out doing stuff for herself. \n\nI have a sinking hole in the center of my chest that just won‚Äôt stop. I‚Äôm more alone than I‚Äôve ever been. The 1 person I‚Äôve centered my life around for the past 11 years is not only lying and sneaking, buts she continued to do it despite me telling her she‚Äôs caught and how much it hurts me. \n\nThe kids are oblivious to it. But it hurts me even more knowing they are about to be blind sided by this divorce as much as I was. And I can‚Äôt stop them from feeling any pain from it. \n\nMy near future looks like a war. She is saying she won‚Äôt leave the marital home. And I have no choice but to stay. She can‚Äôt pay the mortgage and it‚Äôs my kids home. So I can‚Äôt just leave. Which means I will be stuck, living with her, and watching this day in and day out. Dealing with it alone. Dealing with the pain alone. And knowing I can‚Äôt stop my kids from eventually being hurt by it too. \n\nWhat do you do to stop the loneliness?!?",

Tasted just like maggie, a tad bit spicier but the cheese does the trick. \n\nHappy :) ",

I haven‚Äôt nurtured relationships with ‚Äúfriends ‚Äú from my past because I go into isolation 80% of the time due to anxiety and depression. I‚Äôve always desired a romantic partner, someone who mutually chooses to love me despite whatever. But I‚Äôve never experienced that with anyone, and I‚Äôm hurting from a very recent and very painful situation with yet another person who decided I‚Äôm not worth loving. It was the closest I got to an actual relationship. Every where I turn‚Äî tv, movies, books, a solo outing‚Äî I‚Äôm reminded of how lonely I am. It seems everyone has someone, or at least had someone. I can‚Äôt say either. I wake up and I‚Äôm sad to be there. I stay high as often as possible to avoid my thoughts, that doesn‚Äôt work anymore. I try to sleep every moment I can to avoid the feelings that I feel, of course that‚Äôs only temporary. Every single day I pray for my existence to stop being.

    "selftext": "For background I am a 27-year-old gay guy. \n\nFor my entire life especially growing up I always felt misunderstood, alone, and unlovable. \n\nThen I met David. We were together for 3 and 1/2 years. He made me feel so special and safe and loved and understood. He told me so many times that he loved me no matter what and that we would always be together. It was the happiest time of my life even though a lot of things went bad during it. He told me he was happier than ever also. \n\nI was completely in love with him and gave everything for him. I loved him more than the rest of the world combined. I would have stood by him against impossible odds because I loved him that much.\n\nBut then he betrayed me in the worst way possible. \n\nHe had just gotten a really good job that was fully remote and even put it on speaker phone so I could celebrate with him as they gave him the offer. He told me he wanted to go buy a house with me and I was so excited to finally spend the rest of my life with him.\n\nWe spent a month and a half thinking about where we would want to live, and eventually settled on Minnesota. He even had me do a trip out there to go see what it was like to make sure we'd want to do that. Afterwards it was decided that he would pack up the apartment and I would drive us in all the stuff there over the course of a few days. \n\nI had complete trust in him. I went to go visit my grandma while he was supposedly packing up. But when I got back the place was a mess, All of his stuff was gone, and he took the cat also.\n\n He left a note for me saying that he wanted a break for a few months to make sure that he wanted to spend the rest of his life with me before we did that. He then listed off a bunch of grievances he had, many of which were minor things that had happened years ago that we had already had talked about and apologized for. He even brought up something that happened in the first week of us dating.\n\nI felt so hurt and betrayed even more so because I told him before I could forgive him for anything even really bad things like cheating, but I needed him to promise to never leave me while I was on a trip, because that was my number one fear. That's exactly what he did. \n\nI tried calling him just to find that he had blocked my number. I replied to his message while crying harder then I ever had before. Telling him he lied he lied he lied and that he was a sociopath for betraying me like this and pretending everything was good. Pretending that he wanted this nice life with me when he really was packing up and leaving for himself. \n\nI was beyond distraught. \n\nI had told him just a few days before that for the first time in my entire life I had finally felt safe. üò•\n\nHe replied to my message the next morning, telling me how much he cried seeing my hurtful words towards him. He never addressed how he made me feel. \n\nHe then told me that none of this was healthy and that he was breaking it off for good. \n\n\nI had finally felt safe. \nBut in reality I was more alone than ever.\n",

Chatting everyday for hours and days never felt empty. I ended our friendship yesterday because I‚Äôm tired of having to ask for things.

Hear him out and always make sure he‚Äôs getting the rest he needs, especially when he has family stress. All I wanted was the same to be done for me and it just wasn‚Äôt. He knows the things the things that make me mad, yet does them either way. When I have work early, we end up arguing until 2 AM sometimes because I have to sit there and explain why I‚Äôm upset, despite him already knowing what upsets me and what doesn‚Äôt. We‚Äôve known each other years. I have terrible insomnia and it just keeps getting worse. We‚Äôve been here before. He said I deserve better. He said I‚Äôm amazing and kind and great, yet when I needed him to be kind and considerate of me just a few days later, he wasn‚Äôt. I never understood why I always felt like I was asking for too much. I just want to be able to call him after a long day and laugh and feel better, but it‚Äôs like he forgets and just makes my day a million times harder by saying things that upset me. \n\nEvery second that passes I‚Äôm resisting sending him a text. I‚Äôm lonely and I miss him but I‚Äôm so stuck in the loop of asking him to be better. I feel guilty because it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm erasing all the amazing things I‚Äôve had with him for some of the bad.

That brought me back to life. Ppl noticed me, were helping me. They wanted things for me, and I hit pretty close to the mark, thanks to each and every single one of them that pushed me. Pushed me out of the void. Then I went home, instantly back into the endless void. And here I am, just floating along, nobody sees me. If they do, they wonder what could've happened to that man to be in that kind of condition so young. Hobbling, with a cane, with enough titanium in my spine to make a piece of the rocket ship.

It is enormously destructive to feel like you have to put more weight on yourself to unload the worries of your mind..... feeling like you can go outside, & not feel burdened by the stress that life throws at you.... we all walk this path in life we all go to a yellow path paved for us to try things we may not want to try, but there are times where I feel like i'll always be alone... in a hole stuck in a ditch... with no one to grab their arm & pull me out of the trenches with pain & sadness within me. ;/\n\nI don't know what to do.....¬†when over time these decisions we make dwindle and even though I continue to struggle with day to day tasks, the help is not there & it sucks when you cant find support that you need.¬†maybe I could just be homeless & cry giving how cold things are I could freeze on the streets feeling like I have no worth. I wish I could find more answers in this sad world.",

So I put him out and in return he had the bank take my car (we were on a loan together and all i needed was for him to sign it as i was paying the note by myself but bc i put him out he refused), which led to me losing my job bc my job was almost 1hr from where I lived and then I lost my house. My oldest sons dad said we could live with him and that turned into a disaster. I think he only did it to make someone else jealous. But now I'm stuck here with nowhere else to go and him constantly telling me he wants me to leave. And before anyone say what about your family. I reached out to my mom who said I can live with my brother but I'm too scared to bc of the history of sexual abuse from him when we were little and my mom dismissed it bc of his disability. I have a job where I am now and I make $20/hr but haven't been able to work due to a unforseen illness that causes me to pass out and workers compensation is taking forever and that is not even to be dependent on if I will get it.

I have a speech impediment  and that's probably what influenced it over the years . I started online school in the 7th grade so the connections i had with my friends from elementary school just kinda faded over time, so that hasn't really helped me socially either. But i was working for a bit at a restaurant  and that helped open me up a bit with connecting with people,I was also going to small public college which also helped too. but  I decided for my carrier path i wanted to step completely out of my comfort zone. So i moved away from my home across state to Alaska to attend in person . Obviously everything is different, from the way i half to dress to even the food,they don't have good Mexican food at all, so its a good thing i know how to cook, even if what i make is Texmex...but the people here have made me feel really alienated, It's not that people are not nice here but they don't have anything particularly to do with you passed small talk. I live in a dorm with a roommate and it still feels like this, there's literately no connection and Ive tried but im not going to force it either . I don't know what I'm doing wrong and it really hurts. I feel really stupid in the way I'm feeling. I'm 24 years old and i have nothing together, and i feel that everyday when i look around me . the classes i take people are a little bit younger so i feel even more disconnected and out of place. I think I've had a crying session almost everyday here. I'm still trying to connect though, i even signed up to take a class at the gym and im currently looking for a job on campus . I know i should probably talk to someone, i just feel like im bothering people, and i don't want to be a bother when my problem is so insignificant compared to so many things that are happening right now. there are days i don't want to wake up, and i know if i made that a reality i would break my mother, i don't want to worry her so i tell her im okay when im really not. i just want to be normal but i just feel broken . I tell myself I'll be okay, that maybe this is just a feeling now and it will pass. I try all the time to be optimistic but i don't feel like that today, Though i do feel a bit better writing this, though I'll probably delete this later, i just needed some pressure off my chest.",

There‚Äôs no one left in my life to talk to, no one to share my pain with. I used to have some really good friends people I thought would stick by me through thick and thin. But over time, they‚Äôve all drifted away.\n\nIt‚Äôs not like I didn‚Äôt try. I always stood by them during their tough times, but whenever I faced something difficult, they either weren‚Äôt there or just disappeared. Some of them made promises like, *‚ÄúWe‚Äôll always be together,‚Äù* but now, I don‚Äôt even know where they are.\n\nOne of my best friends, someone who promised never to leave me, isn‚Äôt talking to me anymore. She used to say things like, *‚ÄúI‚Äôll never leave you alone, no matter what happens,‚Äù* but if I made even a small mistake, her reaction was harsh. She‚Äôd cut me off, tell me not to talk to her, and act like I didn‚Äôt exist. It hurts so much.\n\nThese days, I try to keep myself busy‚Äîworking, walking alone, or just finding something to distract myself‚Äîbut nothing seems to fill the void. Most nights, I end up locking myself in my room and crying, wondering, *Am I really that bad of a person?*",

    "selftext": "So basically, the thing is that I have been a victim of loneliness for the past 6 months because all my good friends went their separate ways after school ended, and I ended up feeling a bit alone. But I was optimistic that once college started, I would make new friends. However, as soon as I went to college, all my hopes were shattered because I saw that most people already knew each other and had their own friend circles. Whenever I tried to talk to someone, they were either highly spoiled or extremely introverted.\n\nI‚Äôm personally an ambivert, so as of now, I haven‚Äôt made a single new friend. All my old friends are busy with their own lives. So, the conclusion is that I want to make friends because I feel like I need someone to express myself to. But the thing is, I don‚Äôt fit in with the kind of people I‚Äôve described who are in my college.\n\nI‚Äôm really confused that if nothing has happened in the past 6 months, what can I really expect in the future? Sometimes I feel like giving up a year and trying for another college because I have to travel around 40 km daily from home to college.\n\nSecondly, my other problem is that I‚Äôm not even sure if friendship is truly my source of happiness. I feel like the absence of a friend is the issue in my life, but I don‚Äôt know if having friends will actually make me happy. I‚Äôm really confused at this point about what I truly need in life to feel happy.\n\nSo, please, someone, help me out. üôè",

At this point I‚Äôve been crying all day feeling like shit  not worthy of having a special day, that‚Äôs when my parents eventually followed suit. By 4 I decide to peel myself off the couch and take food around to my parents along with a cake. All was going good, I was smiling finally. My mum kept saying ‚Äúcoffee and cake time soon‚Äù which lifted my spirits, in my head candles would be put on my cake and people would come around and sing happy birthday around me. Something so small and normal but means so much. How wrong I was again. No I got told by both my parents that I had to go into the kitchen and cut the cake myself. When I replied ‚Äúreally? No candles atleast?‚Äù I was told I wasn‚Äôt a baby. This really put every happy emotion I had out the door. So not only was I not worthy of people wishing me a happy birthday aka remembering me, know I‚Äôm not even worthy of something so little but sentimental that happens at all ages. I eventually go in the kitchen and get the cake that I bought myself out and plate it, all while trying not to have a mental breakdown. At this time my mum came in saying how pathetic I was not once but continuous times because of how I was feeling about this. That‚Äôs when I dropped the knife and walked out. I haven‚Äôt heard from either parent since.\n\nAnd now its the next day and I haven‚Äôt left my bed. I‚Äôm in my apartment alone and crying because I truly now realise what I mean to people‚Ä¶.

I realized I secluded my self. Leading to a few years of depression. Making excuses for not hanging out. Not reaching out to hang out or eating alone instead of with my family at the table.ETC.  Its not easy but it helps to say yes to things even if you \"know\" you won't enjoy it. I started committing to the (few) invites I was given. Enjoying them as much as I could. Knowing that I would probably like being home enjoying me time. Also knowing this would help keep me occupied with something other then staying home and rotting.    What also helped me was taking up a hobby from my childhood. I got into building lego sets and making a instagram page to share them. The community also helped me connect with like minded people. Fake it till you make it helped me out of that dark patch.   I still get wave of unhappiness/depression/ loneliness. Its normal but don't dwell on it. \n\nSet a goal no matter how small and take baby steps. \n\n\nI guess the takeaways.\n\n1. Show up.\n2. Put yourself in uncomfortable situations to grow.\n3. Find a hobby and you'll find a great community \n4. Reach out to your family or friends if youre struggling. Please!

I don't even have what people would call a \"third place\". I crave real friendships and a real relationship, but I'm not sure at this point if I'd even know *how* to be a friend or partner to someone. \n\nFor further context, I live in the deep South and am an atheist which unfortunately makes it extremely difficult to find people who don't automatically judge me. Church is a huge \"third space\" and if you don't go, it can make it more difficult to find friends. It can also be a lot harder to find a partner who matches with my beliefs. I would also go to more events or classes that are offered in my area, but I live in a small-ish city and there's really nothing to do around here. \n\nI'm just very tired and lonely and I would be open to online friends, but online friends are just not the same as having friends in real life.

I understand I‚Äôm still young and have plenty of time, but it‚Äôs hard to believe my situation will improve.\n\nI have such a bleak view of the world.

I worked a remote job but got laid off in early December. Fortunately, I saved enough money to stay unemployed for a while, so I decided to focus on my mental health since I haven‚Äôt been doing well.\n\nI thought socializing more might help, so today, I went to a bar to watch the NFL divisional games and try to meet people. But as soon as I got there, I felt uncomfortable and self-conscious. Everyone seemed taller, they were all with friends, laughing and cheering and I was just alone. I kept worrying that people thought I was weird. I wasn‚Äôt doing anything except standing there watching the game, but I felt out of place.\n\nI‚Äôm also terrified of getting hurt again, so I retreat into my shell without giving people a chance. Someone at the bar actually struck up a conversation with me, and he seemed nice, but I felt so awkward and uncomfortable that I forgot how to talk.\n\nTonight, that burning feeling came back.

Objectively my childhood wasn't that bad, but in school I was permanently anxious and overtired and even 12 years later I still have regular nightmares. Every feeling of success I thought I had was only the relief of being done with a task, as I later learned. I was hoping, living on my own, a long-term relationship, flings or a university course I'm interested in would change how I feel about live, but nothing felt in any way meaningful or rewarding. I tried pretty much everything that other people claim brings them happiness or meaning, like hobbies, religion or spirituality. Since COVID I do literally nothing but rot in my bed and kill time in front of screens, everything else is a chore without payout. I stayed in mental hospitals five times in the last six years and even if there were options I haven't explored yet, I wouldn't have the energy.\n\nBut when the meds, that emotionally sedate me fail to work, which happens more and more often, the feeling of utter loneliness and helplessness eats me alive. I feel like the protagonist from Kafkas 'A Hunger Artist'. It's not like I don't feel hunger but that in the whole world, there is no meal that could satiate me.\n\nI would love to find a partner who feels like me, who has no goals or future and just wants to kill time with me until it runs out. At least I think so. But then, going in a relationship with the knowledge I won't change for the better and for the sole purpose of entertainment would be incredibly selfish.",

Maybe 3 - 4 years starting when I was 19, but one day for the reason of ‚Äúbettering herself‚Äù she left with the promise of coming back after a couple weeks. Now I‚Äôm fine with someone bettering themselves away from other people, but I have self esteem issues so I thought I was doing something wrong and beating myself up for it. I never brought that up with her though as I didn‚Äôt want to make her feel guilty. However, the weeks turned into months and I finally started to ask if she‚Äôs ever gonna come home, to me, our pets, everything we were building. And I got the same answer. The months rolled into a year and, from there, into a year and a half. I won‚Äôt go into specifics on what happened in that time because it‚Äôs a little too much for the r/lonely community lol. I essentially just wanted things to go back to normal, I wanted to be treated the same or even with a little respect and to stop being lied to.

I don‚Äôt know what to do with the lingering feeling of always being upset about a lack of intimacy or communication, when I myself am the one rejecting it all for peace of mind.\n\nI recently broke up with someone who was the nicest and gentlest person I have had the pleasure to know. But I cannot pinpoint a more solid reason of why I did so, other than - I just got tired and felt bored with them. To think I‚Äôd ever say these things a year after being in a toxic relationship? I feel as if I‚Äôve taken up those traits myself in a way. I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶\n\nI came to the conclusion that I wouldn‚Äôt want to be in another relationship for long, perhaps for very long. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm ready for commitment towards a single person all my life or at least for a huge chunk of it as that. \n\nThat being said, I‚Äôm in the process of coping with my studies, which I know I must pursue, because my parents who do not have enough of a stable income nowadays are basically spending their savings on my education abroad. I don‚Äôt feel guilt ridden necessarily that it‚Äôs manipulation in any way, I genuinely feel very responsible and grateful to them for this opportunity, all the while knowing - I cannot let their efforts go to waste. \n\nI moved out of my parents‚Äô home last summer for my studies in the UK, and have been visiting them regularly on holidays. Of course it is amazing, that I eat well and surround myself with the people I love most, but I feel like my family is just boring. They lack that provocative feeling and adventurous mindset for anything outside of staying at home. That aside, there‚Äôs always shit brewing when I‚Äôm back. Every time I‚Äôm home I miss the UK, and when I‚Äôm in the UK I miss home. It‚Äôs a common cliche most international students face duh. \n\nI think that‚Äôs enough of a backstory I‚Äôm comfortable with sharing. I just think wherever life has brought me today is to definitely test my discipline and will power, which I am very proud to say I have under control. \n\nIf there would be anything I‚Äôd change I‚Äôd probably replace my guts to take more chances and be more open to changes in routine - maybe that way I‚Äôd meet more people, and finally find someone I can connect with for a great foundation. I‚Äôm probably gonna do that this term, but I‚Äôm still gonna take my time with it. \n\nThese past two years have been the most abundant in terms of life experience and lessons for me, maybe that‚Äôs why I feel so drained?

Am I on the right track?

My mom made sure I socialized with other homeschooled kids through homeschool meet-ups, like co-ops. But I was never really exposed to the outside world. My only interactions with people who weren‚Äôt homeschooled were through church, but I was too socially awkward to ever talk to them.\n\nI‚Äôd say I‚Äôm an extrovert. I need people in my life 24/7. I don‚Äôt think homeschooling was the right thing for me. I was raised Christian‚Äîand my parents used curriculum that taught me to see the world through a Christian worldview. The problem is, I want nothing to do with that. All I want out of life is to be like everyone else in the world. And I think it‚Äôs so unfair that my parents handicapped me like this.\n\nThis isn‚Äôt to say I hate my parents. I know they did what they thought was right for me, and I love them. But I believe their biggest mistake while raising me was never giving me the chance to learn how to make plans and schedule meet-ups with my friends. My parents didn‚Äôt want me to have a phone when I was young, so naturally, my mom scheduled everything for me.\n\nBecause of this, I‚Äôve always viewed social interactions as very structured and organized‚Äîlike someone always has to schedule them. But now I‚Äôm in the real world, and it works so differently from what I could even understand.\n\nFor the past several years, I‚Äôve gotten jobs and gone to high school and college. I literally can‚Äôt make a single friend. I‚Äôve learned how to make small talk. I can make acquaintances with people, and some even say they can‚Äôt tell I was homeschooled. But that‚Äôs as far as it ever goes. Nobody texts me. Nobody asks me to hang out. Nobody seems to want anything to do with me.\n\nI‚Äôm starting to think that because of the way I was raised, I don‚Äôt see the world properly. I don‚Äôt see social interactions the way everyone else does. In 2025, it‚Äôs so hard to make friends with people through things like in-person conversations, Snapchat, or Instagram. There are so many unspoken rules that nobody ever explains to you. For me, trying to socialize feels like trying to learn French by only talking to French speakers‚Äîborderline impossible.\n\nIt‚Äôs honestly hopeless. I‚Äôve accepted that I‚Äôm never going to figure it out. I feel doomed to always be the weird homeschooler that nobody likes. It‚Äôs honestly sad.",

Then they ditched me on my birthday Halloween party ect‚Ä¶ and my other friend also got into a relationship last week and told me we are going to hangout today then posted hanging out with his gf after I JUST SAID ‚ÄúI really need to get out of the house I‚Äôm not doing ok right now I can‚Äôt be alone‚Äù. He didn‚Äôt even straight up tell me plans changed. He ignored me and he‚Äôs also done this in the past. I talked to both of them about just talking to me and nothing changed.

I don‚Äôt even want a relationship I just want somebody who gives a fuck about me. I‚Äôve fought for my friends, bought groceries when they were struggling, listened to their worries and offered advice or comfort, showed up EVERY TIME they said they needed me even when I was in a really really bad relationship.

I honestly just want a friend to give me a hug listen to me and comfort me a bit. I don‚Äôt need above and beyond I just want to know I‚Äôm not alone. But the only way I can find that is searching online I just need someone actually in my life to care. I started joining weird groups just to have anyone to talk to. Not even about this I‚Äôm just desperately searching to find some way to not feel this way anymore- some connection. But at the same time this cry for help in itself is likely pointless, I deeply struggle to connect to others even when their kind and often see things in a way different light than others and am almost always out of place. I could try to fit in but I don‚Äôt want to loose who I am, I like me and other people seem to also when they give me the chance and look past my anxious or accidentally intimidating exterior.

Since the divorce I been lost on where to go and what to do with myself. I feel I have no energy to find love again. I was just told by my ex that she is with someone now. And I told her I am happy for her and want her too be happy. But the news just made me feel more alone in this world. More then ever truthfully. I feel like I am falling down this dark pit day by day loosing sight of light at the top. And the farther I fall it seems it's harder for me to see anybody or enjoy doing things. All I want to do is sit in my home. I have been walking with a mask on for months and taking it off at home only. The slightest things break me into a depression. Even the simplest things have me in tears for only 5 seconds and then it's like I snap out of it. I am lost...  and I feel like I don't know if I can grab a ledge before I hit the bottom of this put too climb out. I want too. But I feel so defeated. I just hate the thought of me dying in my place alone. \n\nWell I won't bother anyone who took the time with anymore of my rambling. Thank you if you took the time too read this. Love you all. And always remember to treat the one you love with all your heart. Or you might find yourself falling down this same pit.\n\nMeditatedkarma",

    "title": "29M - Void in life",
    "selftext": "I have a huge void of loneliness in my life and haven't been able to progress through it. I do know grief and loss are different for everyone but for me it feels like the pain continues to worsen versus get better\n\nMy dad was diagnosed with a \"treatable\" cancer in March of 2024, Prior to this he was working, healthy and helping me in my real estate business with physical labor. All of sudden, our worlds came crashing down as all the treatments didn't work for him and he spent most of his time in the hospital until August 5th where he departed to heaven. During these 5 months, I spent almost every moment I could with him. Obsessed with the idea of getting him the treatment he needed and refusing to leave his side. I stood by him and slept in the hospital 24/7 only to go home every few days just to quickly shower and return. I watched him suffer, the man I loved so much, my best friend, my rock and the only person to understand me in my life. When he passed my world came absolutely crumbling down and I felt my entire soul die with him.\n\nAt the same time, I had an amazing girlfriend, the first girl I ever loved in my entire life. I have had been in several relationships in the past but I always romanticized the idea of love to be equivalent to marriage. And some how this girl was the first one who managed to break this thought in my head and I truly was in love with her and wanted to marry her. She stood by me in the hospital and through it all even the moment he passed away but then my heart came crumbling the following week of his passing. My mom sat me down and told me my dad (role model, best friend, my rock) had never approved of her and that my mom also doesn't approve of her and that they were telling me that they approved of her because I was under so much stress/pressure/sadness when I was in the hospital bed-side with my dad 24/7. So for my own sake they didn't add to it. This destroyed me, the next day we got into a stupid relationship argument but because of my mental state and what my mom had just told me the day before we broke up. The following 3 weeks without her were the hardest weeks of my life as I lost all of my heart at the same time. \n\nAfter that we got back together but the relationship was never the same. I wasn't the same individual and the thought of marriage to me was absolutely tainted. I loved this person but could I marry a person that my father didn't approve and neither does my mother? An internal debate that I couldn't justify but i stayed with her because I loved her fully with my heart and she was the only one there for me when all my family abandoned me. Eventually she found out about the fact that my parents hadn't approved of her and everything with to absolute crap. Eventually one day at a wedding she got drunk and had an outfit that lead to us breaking up for good this was in November 2024. \n\nAfter some cooling down we reconnected in December 2024 but not as a couple however, most of the attributes of our \"relationship\" had stayed the same. There was a lot of physical connection still happening but most important for me she was still my person. The only person who understood how i felt, loved me and I would talk to all the time. Basically we were \"dating\" without a title until to DR with a group of friends a couple weeks ago and come back to her have connecting with another guy. She sat me down and basically told me she wants to explore the connection/relationship with the other guy. And in all honesty, it is her right. Our \"reconnection\" was correct; I was holding onto an idea that wasn't going to help because of the void and emptiness in my heart. But now I don't have her anymore from having her and she is in my direct friend group and she brings this guy around and I die inside. I die when I see the way she smiles at him, i die when i see her eyes glow looking at him, i die at all their interactions but this is the poison i chose for myself. \n\nI don't know what to do. I know its done between us and she will continue exploring this guy but I don't want to continue to being hurt as now it has caused me tremendous anxiety and my grief has amplified. I find myself crying hysterically and shaking. I can't be comfortable with her bringing the guy into our small tight-knit group. And I think the best thing to do for now is distance myself but I dont know how. I also have no one who understands me or my pain like she did and losing that aspect of her is the worst part for me.",

My assistant manager (19M) had his phone just constantly going off with text messages today. It's Sunday, we're chilling anyway, no big deal. I did make a remark to the effect of \"wow that's a lot of text messages you're getting today\". He then responds \"you don't have any friends, so you wouldn't know\". I felt like I had just been gut punched. I honestly teared up and had to walk away for a minute. Hearing this from someone who I consider a friend, to have him tell me I have no friends I think really put it in perspective for me. In all reality, he is absolutely correct. I have nobody that cares about me outside of family. I don't have anybody that I can just talk with or enjoy dinner or a movie or a board game or anything. The worst part is, I don't know what more I can do to solve this problem. I consider myself to be a pretty nice, enjoyable person to be around. No, I'm not the most interesting person ever, but I feel like that shouldn't be a huge obstacle to make friends. I just need someone that can be a friend to me. Because today really hurt me in a way that I've never experienced before. ",

I have friends but I don‚Äôt see them in person as often as others would see their friends. \n\nI‚Äôve been on several dates before with 2 different people. But it was two years ago atp and it never led to anything serious. Since then I‚Äôve planned dates with others, but cancelled them before even going on them for various reasons. (All these were from dating apps, which is probably why it never worked out). \n\nSince it‚Äôs been so long, I always find myself craving the feeling of kissing and physical closeness. I‚Äôve forgotten what it feels like since it‚Äôs been so long. I‚Äôve had the opportunity to feel it again several times since, but I cannot stop self sabotaging. I ghost, I nitpick the other person, always finding a reason to cancel plans or shut down any chance of anything happening. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm unlikeable or undesirable. I‚Äôm not the best looking person ever, and I‚Äôm not the nicest or the smartest, but it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm horribly ugly or anything. There are people who like/could like me. It‚Äôs just that there‚Äôs something in me that makes me instinctively push someone away when they‚Äôre too close. \n\nI‚Äôm rambling on here, but I‚Äôll give some examples of the self sabotage. I matched with this guy on hinge not too long ago. We texted a lot for a couple weeks. The texting period was that long cuz I was out of town and wouldn‚Äôt be back for a while. We planned a day to go on a date but didn‚Äôt have a definitive plan on what to do. As the day approached, he texted asking me if I still wanted to go out. As of today I still haven‚Äôt responded. I didn‚Äôt even open the message. The day we had planned has already passed two days ago. I convinced myself I‚Äôm too far deep and now I can‚Äôt respond. It‚Äôs not like there was anything wrong with this guy that was immediately obvious. In fact I thought he was cute and much better compared to other guys I talked online with. I just couldn‚Äôt bring myself to face the possibility of getting close with someone. \n\nAnother example: springtime 2024 I matched with a guy on hinge and we texted a lot as well. He was out of town so we couldn‚Äôt meet for a while. When we did, i found him so so physically unattractive that i had to leave. He was very much more into me than i was into him. Sometimes I feel like I should‚Äôve ignored how ugly he was and just went with it. At least then I could‚Äôve experienced closeness. \n\nPivoting a bit here, but I always find myself finding others ugly. Whenever I‚Äôm on hinge (I know, maybe I should get off of it since clearly it‚Äôs not going well), when I got through my likes, I just find everyone so ugly. On hinge and in real life, the people I find attractive are never attracted me. It‚Äôs always the ones I find unattractive that‚Äôre into me. It‚Äôs so weird and I don‚Äôt understand it. \n\nI don‚Äôt know why things are like this. The problem isn‚Äôt that people aren‚Äôt attracted to me. They are. It‚Äôs just that I can‚Äôt find anyone that I‚Äôm attracted to. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever stop sabotaging myself and suppressing my desires and emotions. ",

    "title": "(22 M) Late Night Thoughts on Loneliness, Validation and Self-Love.",
    "selftext": "Last night, the loneliness really got to me; in fact, it actually hurt. It was a pervasive, dull ache in my chest and stomach that I couldn't escape.\n\nI am glad with how I dealt with it. Usually, in desperation for relief, I would masturbate (live vicariously through porn stars), trauma dump, or overshare‚Äîwhich I always regretted. But instead, in that moment, I just breathed my way through. Instead of fighting or running from the ache, I just sat with it and felt it until it passed. The reassuring thing is: it always passes.\n\nGiving myself that time and space allowed me to think and learn some things. I believe there are three main reasons why I find loneliness/being alone so painful:\n\n1.) I depend too much on external validation.\n\n2.) It reaffirms the possibility that who I am is fundamentally unlovable.\n\n3.) I desperately want to partake in that beautiful vulnerability, compassion, and evolution which love allows.\n\nI believe the last two problems emanate from the first‚Äîoverdependence on external validation, which I know stems from the fact that I don't truly love myself.\n\nOn the surface, it seems like I do: I present as a well-adjusted young adult. I'm clean, I'm healthy, and‚Äîfor the most part‚ÄîI am responsible. However, when I analyze my few relationships (including family), I realize I do not give myself the time, empathy, praise, or care I so readily give to others. My achievements are meaningless until someone else (or society) acknowledges them; I cannot find myself beautiful (inside or out) until someone else sees the beauty in me. If everyone hates me, I hate myself; and if everyone loves me, I wonder how long it will be until I let them down. I so readily sacrifice myself for others‚Äînot out of selflessness, but because I don't acknowledge my pain as equal to theirs. I don't value myself; I don't love myself.\n\nI think (in my situation) the solution isn't finding a relationship, or going to a party or social club. Even though that is important‚Äîbecause community is important‚ÄîI think first and foremost I have to change my relationship with myself because the only company that is guaranteed is my own. It is funny how we put so much weight on others loving us, showing up for us, caring about us, being understanding and forgiving of us, sacrificing for us, making time for us, and then get depressed when it is missing. But how often do we do that for ourselves?\n\nSo now, I am shifting my mental paradigm. From now on, the most important opinion pertaining to my life is my own. I determine the values by which my worth is measured. My time, my presence, and my dreams are just as important and fulfilling as any external relationship. My purpose is defined by me, and Inasmuch as I hold a responsibility to others, I hold the greatest responsibility to myself. My work, my achievements, and my personal integrity all matter because I say so, and that is enough. I am interesting, I am complex, and I am entertaining and my own company has value.\n\nI'm excited to see who I become when I put myself first.",

I couldn't even cry for those that meant and/or did so much for me. Me falling in love with you Regardless of how it ended (and it ended horribly) brought me back into feeling human again. \n\nI can easily think of how you made me feel like their was something wrong with the color of my skin when you told me you'd never go out with someone who looked like me. Which was long before you and I even became friends. Can easily think of how possessive you were of me because I didn't respond to your texts for a week because I was spending time with my God daughter and my ex gf. To the point you assumed I blocked you and created a group chat with a mutual friend just to see if I'd respond to him but not you. I can easily remember the times you'd tell me I was your best friend and then you'd tell me I'm the only friend who you ever go out with and one of the VERY few who you talk to and even fewer the one that reaches out to you. Just for you to tell me several times that I needed to stop thinking I was close with you. \n\n\nIt's really easy for me to remember the many times you'd absolutely cry your eyes out on my chest and tell me stories of people you've lost in life or things done to you and how much you were glad to have me.

Incredibly easy to remember the 1st time you told me you loved me as it was before I even developed feelings for you and you spent weeks trying to get me to see you as a woman instead of just a friend. You'd show me pics of you in different outfits and ask me what I'd think and I'd always respond by saying you looked OK. That answer was never good enough for you. Just for me to tell you a few months later that i loved you and you'd respond by trying to hold my hand and apologize. Easy to remember how you'd tell me you're disappointed with your sex life and use a dildo to satisfy your desires. Along with telling me it was black. \n\nLove remembering when you were fired from both of your civilian jobs so I helped you get an new job. Just for you to get upset that I wasn't texting you at work and you'd come yelling for all my coworkers to hear how upset you were that I wasn't texting you. Vividly remember when you had to report for duty with the army and I talked to you the day before you went. Just for you to get mad that i texted our friends the day you're actually there instead of just you.\n\n I remember being in the hospital and you telling me after every night I was there that you loved me and wanted me to get out soon so we could see each other. You'd tell me of the risqu√© clothes you'd wear one day and how I should've seen you in them so I needed to get better soon. You'd go into detail on what sexual things you wanted to do to me. Just for me to ask you if you loved me and if our lives turned out differently could we have been together and your answer was \"I could see myself loving you but i don't and yes we would be together\". I remember a month later I'd decide to cut you off from my life and not talk to you. You'd text me everyday asking me where I was, did she do something wrong, could I please talk to her. She'd  just start telling me how each of your days went and ending each day with I'd be so proud of her in what she did at work as I pushed for her to do better and better. Just for her to tell me after I asked her about her answeres she gave that everyone she told me she loved me she was lying. \n\nCan remember when you asked me to help you get a uniform for a training event you volunteered for with the army. You didn't have any piece of it so I helped you get a uniform and have it tailored to you. Just for me to try and drop it off at your house(never been there before in our entire \"relationship\") and while you're home and alone you tell me \"please leave it outside I'll get it there\". Can also remember your birthday coming up and I plan a surprise for you at work as I knew you didn't tell any coworkers when your birthday was. You never had something like that done for you so I knew it'd be special and it was....it was the last good day we had together. \n\n\nMore events would happen but unlike before they'd all happen over the course of 3 weeks instead of years and they were far more painful then anything else I've said. Everything put together was enough to finally break me and because of that I was able to cry for the 1st time in 6 years. If anyone actually read all this you may be thinking i could hate her for everything I said but I don't. If it weren't for her I wouldn't have gotten my emotions back. I wouldn't have tried to lose 40 pounds like I did, gotten a house of my own, and apply to college. As the saying goes, better to be in bad company than to be alone. So Breece, you really are my best enemy.",

Well, like the title says I've been struggling more and more with feelings of bitterness and of low self-worth due to loneliness.\n\n   I'm really lucky to have a loving family, friends and to be studying something that makes me happy. But, of course, that list doesn't include romantic love. My only experience in that regard was a relationship of five months four years ago, right before the pandemic. She was in love with me and I liked her, and I was too immature to realize those were not the same. I broke up with her just before valentine's day 2020 via text (I know, I hate myself for that too.).\n\n  Because of my experience then, nowadays I'm really cautious when strangers express interest in me because I don't want to break someone's heart like last time. Two girls expressed their interest last year and I didn't respond because I didn't want to lead anyone on, maybe if I'd talked to them more I'd fallen in love, but I can't risk it. In my dumb mind, I feel like I have to be madly in love with someone right at the start, so that if it ends, I'm the one hurting more than the other person. \n\n  So this has caused me to be even more lonely than I already was, it feels nice to feel a little bit wanted, but I want to love and to be loved.\n\n  If you actually read all of this, thanks.",

And i ended up moving to a different state in Aus from where i was born and raised, then had to make it completely alone.\nI moved here a year ago, and ive been seeing my bf since april, moved in last month,(only became official in Nov), but he is a shift worker. He is sleeping or working so so often, and when he isnt hes stressed out. \n\nHe has so many people, he is born and raised here which is great! \nI just feel so so isolated out here. I dont have anyone but him, and hes barely here. We talk and communicate feelings really well, but fuck me do i hate the silence in this house.\nThe best i have is cats. I love them, but i have no people.\n\nI dont know how to make friends, i dont know how to meet people in person, i have no money, no job, no passions that take me outside other than my motorbike that i ride at 11pm 90% of the time to avoid people.\nI barely have friends online either, a couple people from my home city but thats it. Even my family doesnt talk to me much.\n\nMy 21st is coming up, and thinking about it just hurts. I have no one to throw a party with other than his friends. I have no one to myself\nAnd it might drive me insane\n\nI dont know, i know im rambling. Mental health is wack and i started a new diet which is fucking with me too. \nIf anyone has suggestions on how to meet people or at least get rid of this horrible sinking feeling, that would mean the world\nThank you for reading",

    "selftext": "*So: I am 25 years old man, working a normal 9-5 job at big company, and still living with my parents.*\n\nI try to be and I am a very kind, good and caring person, everybody from colleagues to friends to relatives has been telling me that since I became an adult. And I believe it too. \n\nThe problem is that appart from a group of some very good old friends I have from high school (of both genders) I have no other real relations with people, and of course I never had a romantic relationship with a woman. As a result I have nobody to share my love, help, and generally go through life together.\n   \nAnd as I get older I see the love lives of my friends change and starting to get serious, for example: \n* some have long relationships and are traveling the world together\n* others are marring and moving in together to start a family\n* others moved to foreign countries and have already started metting parterns there who they believe could be their lifelong companions.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I too have achieved some things in my life, I have the work I want, I have finished the degree I wanted while working, I have some hobbies I enjoy. It's just that I have done all of them alone, in isolation... \n\nMeaning that apart from that small friend group, I have no other real people connections, and certainly not a romantic one... Every other person I happen to meet in life, in work or in my hobbies nowadays (men or women) are always kind and into talking with me, but never ever into becoming better friends (for men or women) or interested in a romantic relationship with me (for women). Most of my relationships stay at the \"surface\" let's say, and whenever I ask (a woman for example) if she would like to grab a coffee or something with me sometime, she either outright ghosts me or accepts and then makes it clear (with her actions or directly) that she is not interested in me, and I respect that.\n\nAnd all that long text brings us to the **tldr**: **appart from my family and mayby a small group of friends no-one really cares about me, I have no-one to share my love** *(which believe me I have accumulated plenty)* **, life, or care about each other** it's like if I die tomorrow, my parrents will certainly mourn, but that's probably it...\n\nWhen I was younger, I didn't bother so much about it, I was telling to myself *\"don't worry about it will come when you least expect\" \"try to meet new people and it will happen\" \"just be you, socialize and you'll find someone\"* but this hasn't gotten me anywhere, clearly there is something wrong with me. \n\nMayby people on social media like Andrew Tate (which I hate) are right about people like me, that I am a fucking nobody, and thus, why would anybody care about me? And if that's true, should I just accept that I'll be the lonely uncle in the family gathering and stop presuing anything? (because believe me, the more I get rejected the worse it fells and I can't get much more of it) (and because there is no way I am going down the hyper macho man road, I better stay who I am and lonely, than a bad person and popular)\n\n*Also, to highlight the extent of the above problem, I have developed a severe porn addiction, it's the only thing that helps me nowadays. I am trying to quit it ASAP but it's not easy...*",

    "selftext": "Lately it‚Äôs been so hard to not feel incredibly lonely all the time. \n\nIt‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt talk to people. I talk to people at work, and I go to the gym with one of my coworkers after our shifts. I go to school and talk with my classmates. I‚Äôm captain of my sports team and everyone on the team seems like they look up to me. \n\nBut there are still never any texts on my phone. No friendships that aren‚Äôt necessitated by close proximity. Everyone who is ‚Äòfriends‚Äô with me only talks to me because they‚Äôre forced to. Because they‚Äôre my coworker, my classmate, or my teammate. If it weren‚Äôt for that, they would never speak to me. \n\nAnd I know I‚Äôm not just being paranoid. They really would stop talking to me if I wasn‚Äôt working there anymore or if I switched classes or if I quit my sport. \n\nLast year I graduated high school, and as a result could no longer be on my school‚Äôs team (which I was captain of). Everyone promised to keep in touch, yet I never received a text or a phone call or an offer to hang out with any of them. \n\nI wonder if it‚Äôs that I‚Äôm an unlikable person. What is it about me that makes people so disinterested in actually connecting with me?\n\nIt‚Äôs gotten even worse the past two years. My best friend died in July of 2023. Since then I‚Äôve rarely been invited to any hangouts. One of my friend groups dropped me because I was acting too depressed. This past July my mom died only nine days after the anniversary of my best friend‚Äôs death. Since then my friend group got in a big fight and split in half. I‚Äôm still friends with both halves but we talk way less. My sister moved away. My dad treats me like I‚Äôm a roommate, not his kid. He doesn‚Äôt even call me by name anymore, he calls me bro or dude. He also got a new girlfriend and he spends every day with her so most days I‚Äôm just alone at home if I‚Äôm not at school, work, or practice. \n\nI‚Äôm just so completely alone. And I feel like nobody notices or cares. In fact, most people probably wouldn‚Äôt even notice if I dropped off the face of the world. My dad and sister aren‚Äôt home enough to notice. Nobody texts me or calls me or hangs out with me. Maybe my teacher would notice when taking attendance. \n\nWhen I graduate college this next year (I did an accelerated course in high school so I‚Äôm almost done with college now) everyone will forget I even existed. I am not memorable or interesting at all. \n\nYou know, I had one solace actually. When my best friend died, there was a guy I was friends with in that friend group that left me. To be honest, I had been in love with him for years. He was the one who was the most on my side when the friend group dropped me, but eventually we grew apart. After my mom died he contacted me again. I feel so stupid now, but he hugged me so tightly and begged me to let him be a part of my life again. He told me he was so sorry for not being there for me before, but he wanted to be there now. And I let him back into my life because of course I did. Because I‚Äôve loved him since I was eleven years old. \n\nHe got a boyfriend last month. And you know the thing that really gets me? His boyfriend looks so similar to me. We have the same hair, same glasses, played the same sport, even our faces look eerily similar. And he texts me so rarely now, and when we do talk he talks about his boyfriend. It was never that he didn‚Äôt want a relationship, or because I was a boy, or even that I just wasn‚Äôt his type physically. The problem was just me and my shitty personality. \n\nAnd that‚Äôs how it‚Äôs been my whole life. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm particularly attractive, but I‚Äôm not totally ugly either. I‚Äôm pretty smart (mathlete, competed in some academic competitions and did pretty well, always did well in school, etc), I‚Äôm a good athlete, I‚Äôm in great shape, I‚Äôm a good cook, I work hard, really I‚Äôve got a lot going for me. The issue has always been that I just have a shit personality. Something about me is just unlikable, and I don‚Äôt know what it is. I‚Äôm just a shitty person, and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm so lonely. And I don‚Äôt know how to fix it. ",

He jokes and \"lies\" a lot so you can rarely take him seriously. He's the kind of person that says \"I hate you\" (in a joking tone of course) because of no good reason at all. Anyway, we were talking and he first said \"never change\" which a lot of people say to me. I can't tell if that's a good thing or bad. But a little after that he also said \"you're my favorite person\". And I just don't know what to feel. \n\n\n\nI want to believe him. But I also struggle to think of myself as being anyone's favorite. He and I have been friends for somewhere around 10 years now so we most likely are each other's best friend. But there's a difference between best friend and favorite person.\n\n  \nHe also mentioned recently that he's excited to go off to college so he make new friends and see new faces. He followed that by saying that I'm really the only person he wants to stay in contact with after high school. And that I believe, but still.\n\n  \nI don't know I think I have trust issues and other things. People tell I dress well and I want to believe especially with how much effort I put into how I dress. But I always feel like no one is ever honest. Like unless someone dislikes me they will never insult or say anything bad. So no one will say I'm ugly, or I don't dress well, or my voice is irritating. Especially my family. I can't ask them anything because they only ever give the answer they think I want to hear. And sure, they ***could*** be honest but I won't think or believe that.\n\n  \nThere was a girl I liked and she told me \"I like you lot\" and I still chose to believe she was lying. Maybe not lying entirely but certainly adding some form of exaggeration. I just wish I could believe people. I wish I could take a compliment. \n\n  \nSo, this is going to be somewhat of a topic shift because I my mind keeps going and I need this.\n\n  \nI don't like talking about certain things because it sounds so narcissistic to me in my head but I'm not trying to be. I'm just trying to express my feelings. But I just sound ungrateful too. But I try seeking validation from people but once I get it I go through the above process again. I asked someone how easily she thinks I get a girlfriend. Or in other words how 'desirable' I am I guess. I think that no one is ever interested in me and I don't know if I'm just not observant or what. But she answered by saying that she thinks I could rather easily get a girlfriend if I had more confidence. I just don't know how much to believe her though.\n\n  \nI feel almost like I'm forced into thinking good things about myself. Let me explain. I feel almost showered by people 'praising' me. That sounds weird and kind of wrong but I can't think of a better way to explain it. But I just feel like I'm being fed misinformation by friends and family. I say that because I see a lot of things about like what girls are looking for in a guy or what are good traits etc. And according to family and friends, I'm effectively the ideal person in general. Which I find very hard to believe.\n\n  \nMy family keeps telling me that I've become such a beautiful. And teachers too. People keep telling me about the kind of person I've become and how much I've changed \n\n  \nI have such a hard time trying to express myself or explain my thoughts. Like no words feel quite right. I try saying stuff and it sounds right I suppose but it doesn't quite feel correct. I have feelings beyond words so I can't really explain. And I'm not sure if it is beyond words, or it's just so many words that I couldn't possibly explain in entirety. Also because I'm the only person with my memories so I have to explain each one if it's relevant.\n\n  \nI'll go now. I don't know how to explain what I'm wanting to.",

    "selftext": "I genuinely have no one in my life other than my siblings and I can't trust any of them. My family is so dysfunctional but they are genuinely the only people I have to talk to in this world but they're always busy or gone. \n\nI tried going back to school but I can't do so without the assistance of my parents, but they let every change to re-enroll me just pass by. I've never had any friends and I know that if I went back I still wouldn't have any, but I guess I'd have some social interaction which is better than what I do now. Going outside is an accomplishment on its own which is terrible for anyone but especially someone at my stage in life\n\nI did also have a job but for reasons I don't want to get into, I had to quit and I can't return because I don't have a state issued ID. I also need my parent's assistance for that, but they never want to seem to help me, and they always tell me that money is tight but they somehow wind up with 40$ for cigarettes, snacks, drinks, alcohol, or whatever.\n\nThey call me lazy because I don't go out and I sleep a lot to pass the time because I have no one, but I do everything they tell/ask me to and then some. They always seem appreciative in the moment but I know it's an act because one way or another I always find out how the really feel. Ex: dad ranting to the neighbors about how he has a lazy ass kid because I didn't do the dishes but we have no dish soap, and this is after he went to the store but instead he chose to buy snacks and drinks for him to eat with our mom while. On top of that we have no food. I would have even washed the dishes with body wash but I don't even have that because I rely on them but they can't afford it. \n\nThey always use my lonliness against me whenever they feel that it's time to come down on me. My dad even found out about my sh and while he and my siblings were sitting in a circle he that \"when it's time to get real people want to hurt themselves\" even though that's not at all why I was doing it. Yet when I uncharacteristically decided to stand up for myself, he told me that pays the bills so he can say whatever he feels like. \n\nMy mom is a doormat, unfortunately, and she just agrees with whatever he says for the sake of avoiding hostility, and she let's everything go by because she doesn't feel like dealing with it, and while I understand that she has her own mental and emotional issues it does hurt to be cast aside for whatever my dad feels is right whenever he's on one of his power trips. \n\nMy siblings aren't much better either. All of them show narcissistic traits.\n \nSibling #1(oldest in home): Manipulative, narcissistic, vain. One of those people who tries to use your insecurities against you to make you submit to them and if you don't they make your life hell to make themselves feel better. They've also sa'ed me, but this was when we were kids, but it's still something that lingers in the back of my mind--both myself and the youngest attempted to tell our mother about it when we were younger, but she just said that it was probably an accident and we haven't had the courage to speak up about it since and neither she nor my father would believe us.\n\nSibling #2: Extremely violent when angered and narcissistic. They have extreme anger issues to the point that they punch floors, walls, chairs, and they are also abusive to our pets. They have also assaulted me physically when angry and sa when we were kids. They're also introverted and very misogynistic, a woman can't we right and women can't be victims in their eyes and I think they got this ideology from our father because he holds those same beliefs. \n\nSibling #3: Liar, thief, manipulator, narcissistic. They have so many issues that I don't even know where to begin. \nThey biggest this is that they steal things, in home and outside. They steal anything that they can get their hands on like: money, food, my underwear (ik), hygiene products, and that's just in our house because they also steal from malls and stores. \n\nThey also have the tendency to lie and act out and it's like they're allergic to the word no because every time someone says it to them they lose their minds. I'm talking screaming, yelling, breaking things, and burning their bridges. They just recently ran away for a few days after getting into a screaming match this our father in which they both said so many unacceptable things to each other. They tore our room apart while collecting their things and throwing them into a trash bag and leaving. This waspir dad made an assumption and he screamed at yelled at them in our neighbor's home and did everything he could to embarrass them. Even after he got the full story from them he refused to believe it and everything just became a dumpster fire after they both came home. \n\nThey manipulate our mom into forgiving them with tears an empty promises no matter how many times they put her in situations, which are sometimes life threatening. And our mom lets it happen because she wants us all to be one big happy family.\n\nIn every situation they are miraculously the victims and everything bad that happens to them is always someone else's fault, even if they got themselves in a predicament. Every time they get themselves into am issue their \"friend's\" names always come up and they are always thrown under the bus to savey siblings' skin.\n\n\nIf I went on any more this would be a novel so I guess I'll just stop it here, but I thought I'd give some insight so whoever is reading this can see why I can't really ride my family, despite them being the only people I have. I've attempted to better myself in every aspect that is under my control but nothing seems to work because I couldn't seem to fit in or find individuals like myself despite those efforts. I do my best to be a decent person not even in hopes that I'll benefit from it, but because I know what it feels like to be nothing.\n\nI just don't know what to do anymore, I don't have anything or anyone.",

    "selftext": "I‚Äôm really struggling lately. I‚Äôve noticed a trend throughout my life that people don‚Äôt really like me. In high school, I was bullied by the popular girls and even some of the guys for no apparent reason. People who I barely knew didn‚Äôt really seem to like me sometimes. I had a handful of friends but only one of which I‚Äôm still friends with now (in my 30‚Äôs).\n\nAs an adult, I think I‚Äôm a good person, I‚Äôd never steal from anyone, wouldn‚Äôt flirt with your boyfriend or go behind your back. I don‚Äôt have huge expectations of other people and I‚Äôm happy to put effort into a friendship like cooking meals, hosting bbqs or game nights etc. I‚Äôm not political at all, I‚Äôm difficult to offend and try not to offend others, I‚Äôm very open minded. \n\nDespite this, I only have one friend now which is a girl from hs who I barely see because she‚Äôs busy with her family (has young kids and a full time job). On birthdays and Christmas, I don‚Äôt get cars from anyone but family and maybe the odd neighbour. NYE I didn‚Äôt get a single invitation to go anywhere or do anything. Every weekend passes by and nobody asks me to do anything. I have a partner who is wonderful, but it‚Äôs killing me having no girlfriends I can chat with, it makes me feel so unwanted and isolated. \n\nI‚Äôve even tried reaching out to old friends that I lost contact with, one of them ignored me completely and the other replied once then ignored me when I suggested meeting to catch up. \n\nPeople just don‚Äôt seem to like me, or want to spend time with me and I have no idea why. I dread the idea of my boyfriend asking me to marry him cos who the hell am I going to invite? My side would be my mum and brother and nobody else, it‚Äôd be humiliating. I think the same about my funeral, I‚Äôd be mortified if I weren‚Äôt dead. 32 years on earth and not one good friend that I could call in a time of need or even just call for a natter. \n\nI had 2 friends that I was close with, a guy and a girl. I stupidly dated the guy very briefly after he kept insisting, I realised I felt better as friends and he ghosted me after, that was a 5 year friendship killed. The girl I was friends with randomly fell out with me November last year, she was being cold and offish, turning down any plans I suggested and when I asked what was up, she wouldn‚Äôt say. I went to hers to get some things I‚Äôd left there and she sent her bf to meet me so she didn‚Äôt have to see me. We‚Äôd never argued or fell out about anything, just ghosted with no explanation. She blanked my birthday, Christmas and NYE. I gave her space for 3 months and reached back out expressing that I missed our friendship and she blanked me. \n\nI‚Äôve worked various jobs and had hobbies where I met people and mostly got on ok with others, people who will occasionally send me a meme or like my post but nobody I could call a friend. I see other friendships forming around me but nobody wanting to be my friend. I feel like everyone keeps me at arms length and nobody is interested in me. I just bought a new house and aside from my mum, nobody has even been round and seen it. I sometimes think once my dogs pass away, I‚Äôd just want to go with them tbh, this world hurts. ",

    "selftext": "I (17m) have been best friends with B (17f) for around four years, we became friends because neither of us had that many friends at the time and we had a lot in common. We became really close and she told me a lot about her struggles with mental health and her rough home life. We were always there for one another when the other needed to talk. We go to different high schools and she moved pretty far away but recently moved closer to where I live so I thought we would start hanging out more frequently but we‚Äôve only hung out once since she moved back. \n\nSince we first became friends she‚Äôs only exclusively dated women but she recently got a boyfriend, which is fine I‚Äôve never seen her in a romantic way but after she started dating him I noticed we stopped talking as frequently\n\nI first noticed it back  in November when she wouldn‚Äôt respond to my texts or my comments on her frequent instagram posts. She eventually responded and said that she was busy with college applications so she hadn‚Äôt been good at responding to texts which makes sense but after that she never responded to me again.\n\nI texted her on Christmas just to say merry Christmas but she didn‚Äôt even read the message. I then messaged her a few days later asking to hang out but that message also went unread. I then messaged our mutual friend to ask if there may have been a reason why she was ignoring me. The friend read my message but never responded. I then sent B one more DM on instagram saying that I missed talking to her but I‚Äôm pretty sure she didn‚Äôt read it. I even called her as a last ditch attempt to get in contact with her but it went to voicemail and her messages were full so I couldn‚Äôt even leave a message. \n\nA few weeks ago she posted on her instagram story that her grandma passed away and I commented that I was sorry for her loss and she liked the comment so I thought she at least remembered I still existed. But then earlier  this week I noticed she hadn‚Äôt posted in her main instagram account in a while which is rare for her but when I checked her account she had blocked me.  \n\nI‚Äôm just stunned, devastated and heartbroken, I have no idea what I could‚Äôve done to make her want to cut contact with and block me. I don‚Äôt know if this has anything to do with her new boyfriend because I‚Äôve never met him so I don‚Äôt know anything about him. This just doesn‚Äôt seem like her at all, she‚Äôs always been really kind and cared al lot about her friends so this is completely out of character for her. I‚Äôm totally lost as to how to proceed from here so any advice would be appreciated as to what to do next and as to why she may have blocked me. ",

For context, me and this friend used to be pretty close. This lead me to wondering what they were up to nowadays, so i decided to check out their social media page cus why not right? \nI was looking through their acc and basically seeing what they‚Äôve been up to and well its nothing out of the ordinary. Alot of posting of their hobbies and interests. So i kept scrolling because i truly had nothing better to do at the moment. \n\nThats kinda where i messed up i kept going till i saw an old pic of me and that friend as well as alot screenshots of games we used to play tgt and wow did it bring me down memory lane.  It‚Äôs kinda sappy but i miss the times that we shared together and i‚Äôm just kinda sad that we had to drift apart. \n\nThen i really started to think back of when we used to be close friends and i just honestly started feeling like shit. \n\nTo give some background, me and this friend were close for around 4 years before we started drifting apart. It was kind of a slow thing but the fact that our friendship was over only hit me when I realised how despondent they became to me in general. It wasn‚Äôt as if they cut me off but it was more like, they never seemed to reach out and i was the only one ever making the effort. And even when i was the one makinh the effort they tended to be very unreceptive. So i just gave up. Because why should I stick around when it‚Äôs clear i‚Äôm not wanted. \n\nWhat irks me is that my friend practically ‚Äúdropped‚Äù me for our mutual friend. \n\nThe thing is my friend and that mutual friend were semi-close for awhile before me and my friend has even met. So when they finally got back in touch with each other (during me and my friend‚Äôs 4th year of friendship), they started talking alot more and eventually excluding me. They were practically glued together at all times. Their exclusion wasn‚Äôt overly cruel or anything but it just kinda feels like that feeling you get when everyone‚Äôs in on a joke except you and no one wants to tell you what the joke is. \n\nMy friend just seemed to appreciate the presence of our mutual friend alot more whenever we would hang out. As if my presence wasn‚Äôt needed, and well, to be frank, it probably wasn‚Äôt. They just seemed to click alot better I suppose. Aside from that, they also seemed to form a larger group of friends i was‚Äôt apart of, which was disappointing. \n\nAdditionally, whenever I would send them a text they always took 2+ days to respond. Which, i can understand but they were the type of person to be online very frequently and text back relatively fast. \n\nI was sad, but ive gotten used to friends coming and going so I just didn‚Äôt want to keep beating a dead horse by trying to stay good friends. And sure enough we grew apart. \n\nI just miss the period of time when we were close friends because it felt like we were always in lockstep and having a fun time. I felt like a more authentic person at that time.\n\n  I feel regretful because had I been a nicer person ora more giving person to them I could have continued staying good friends. Although I am painfully aware that even if i had been that way, nothing might have changed at all because I‚Äôm still me. \n\n  Nowadays, I have one or two close friends but I‚Äôm just not as close to them as i used to be w my old friend. And even though they‚Äôre alot more responsive, we just don‚Äôt share many interests, or are not always on the same page like me and my old friend used to be. \n\nAll of this just made me start a session of stupid self loathing and I feel like someone just took a crap on me. I just keep wondering why I‚Äôm the way that I am, and i keep wishing I was someone that someone would find indispensable. Really fucking weird i know. I just hate myself, which isn‚Äôt anything ground breaking, like yeah everyone hates themselves, I‚Äôm not saying anything new. But i can‚Äôt help but hate the fact that I‚Äôm me. I just have no idea what is wrong with me. \n\nI don‚Äôt even know why i feel this way, because I‚Äôve kind of just gotten used to being alone. I don‚Äôt talk to people very frequently and I don‚Äôt really feel a great need for companionship. I‚Äôve always been fine because I have never had an issue with being by myself. So why do i feel so incredibly lonely in this moment? \n",

I mean, guys have told me that I‚Äôm a very good and interesting person but they‚Äôre not feeling it. I always laugh at it: like, when will you be feeling it then, when the girl is bad and boring? If the guy saw that I‚Äôm a great person, he‚Äôd love me. If he doesn‚Äôt love me, then he is just lying and would do me a favor if he said what exactly was wrong with me, so that I could improve. But no one ever does, and I can‚Äôt improve myself and make myself lovable with the ‚Äúyou‚Äôre great, but I don‚Äôt love you‚Äù. \n\nI‚Äôve tried therapists, that was really traumatic and only made me think that even people whom I‚Äôm paying money to treat me well can‚Äôt do it. And that no one will ever love me. I‚Äôm trying to improve myself. I‚Äôm trying to be loyal, nice, have emotional intelligence, be confident, have hobbies, be independent, a good partner. But I‚Äôm never enough. \n\nI‚Äôm actively looking for a relationship. Have been for years now. I go on app dates regularly (the only kind of dates I‚Äôm able to secure, even there no one really pays attention to me). No one likes me. I don‚Äôt have any appearance or income standards ‚Äî I just need someone who loves me and treats me well and won‚Äôt be a problem to me (that is, can take care of himself). But still no guy likes me. Even if ai get past the five dates or three months mark, it all falls apart because guys need for me to fall in love with them by that time and want sex with them, otherwise they accuse me of ‚Äújust wanting to be friends‚Äù. And I don‚Äôt really work like that, I need much more time to get to know someone and fall for them. \n\nAnd then I try to find friends, because everyone persuades me that what I‚Äôm looking for (a ‚Äúcombat buddy‚Äù to go through life together, to pay for bills 50/50, to do chores 50/50, while romantic love and sex are a bonus that might be there or might not be there) is a friend and not a partner. And then my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù leave me accusing that I‚Äôm toxic because I want them to be a partner and not a friend (talk everyday, meet regularly). I was also frustrated on the internet a couple of days ago when I was talking about loneliness in general and someone told me that ‚Äúwhat I‚Äôm talking about is a partner and not a friend‚Äù. It‚Äôs soooo frustrating! Every time when I state I‚Äôm looking for a spouse, people come and ask me not to play with guys, because what I want is really a friend. And when I try to secure the kind of committed friendship that I like and that everyone says I‚Äôm looking for, the friend runs away from me screaming that I‚Äôm asking for too much and that I need to look for a partner. So, what is it? Am I asking for too little or for too much?\n\nI just really want for someone to love and support me. Someone to go through life together. I don‚Äôt care what we call it, I just want to live together, accept each other, solve life issues together, know every little detail about each other and care about it. I don‚Äôt care if we have sex, or children, or love each other romantically. If we do, great, if we don‚Äôt, also great. But I know for sure that I can‚Äôt live alone. It‚Äôs so scary. Ever since I was 14 I just felt that I was destined to be alone. But then I only knew the emotional consequences of it (no one to talk to) and now I know that there are also financial and practical consequences of it and that thriving (or even just surviving) alone is the privilege of the rich, and I‚Äôm poor and disabled. And even if I can be financially stable and capable of solving my issues alone, I really don‚Äôt want to. I want someone to care about me and to care about someone. Otherwise, surviving and clawing your way out of life‚Äôs troubles just ain‚Äôt worth it. And I know what I‚Äôm talking about, I‚Äôve been doing it alone for years. ",

But after first semester I moved into a different dorm far from them and began seeing them less frequently just because of proximity. Then I met my ex boyfriend. We got serious over the summer and he moved in with me. I didn‚Äôt have a roomate all of 2024 besides when my ex was living with me. He was very possessive and I rarely saw my friends while I was with him because I didn‚Äôt want to upset him (he was very jealous and worried I would meet other guys or something and would threaten to break up with me). We broke up the middle of first semester sophomore year. It was really rough for my mental health. Fast forward to now (3 months since I cut him off), I‚Äôm just the loneliest I‚Äôve ever been in my life. I‚Äôll get with guys on Tinder just to not be alone all the time and have some company. I still live alone. I‚Äôm still friends with my friends but it‚Äôs just so different. I feel like such an afterthought and I don‚Äôt get invited to group hangouts anymore. The only time we hang out is when I text them to get lunch or dinner individually. I text the group chat and no one responds. I just feel so lonely and unloved/uncared about. I know for so long I didn‚Äôt hangout with them but they know why. They always say how much they love me and we should hangout more. And I‚Äôm friends with them all individually. It‚Äôs just sad and confusing like I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing wrong. Early after the breakup I would hangout with them in groups but it‚Äôs been months. I have no classes with any of them and I live about half a mile away. I don‚Äôt even see them crossing the street. Anyways I know this is all over the place but I‚Äôm just hurting. I got dinner with one of my friends yesterday and she said how after she was going to shower and go to sleep. Later I saw them all posting about going out lol. Like part of me thinks I just don‚Äôt cross anyone‚Äôs mind but part of me wonders if there‚Äôs a reason they don‚Äôt seem to want me around. Maybe my friend wasn‚Äôt planning to go out and went spontaneously? Or maybe she lied to avoid hurting my feelings? I‚Äôm so lost. I‚Äôm so isolated. I‚Äôm so lonely. It just hurts so bad. Especially knowing after everything my ex did to me (avoiding details but abuse, court cases, manipulation, list goes on) he‚Äôs living his best life and here I am. All alone. With no one to talk to. What‚Äôs wrong with me? Everyone here already has their friends so it‚Äôs hard to make new ones and I struggle with social anxiety. I feel like the only people who want to be around me are older guys who want to have sex with a teenager. Anyways. I don‚Äôt know how much more of this I can take. I‚Äôm trying to start therapy and I might transfer back home. I just miss when life wasn‚Äôt so lonely. Some days I don‚Äôt talk to anyone.",

She talks bad about other girls she knows and says she‚Äôs the best at her job, I guess that seems to attract people towards her. I don‚Äôt really get it. I just find it and have always found it hard to become friends or at least acquaintances with those my age, especially girls. I also never get down in my feelings at work and act pretty confidently, so no one at work would ever know I have these thoughts. I know it‚Äôs probably stupid to care about this, but it still hurts.

    "selftext": "She left me August of last year after 2 years, She left for college and maybe until like the last month of her being here I was under the impression we were going to try to make it work. To then her breaking it off with me 2 weeks later. This breakup destroyed me. She was already talking to other guys that she had met through her University snap shat story,and I didn‚Äôt know what to do. I still saw her almost everyday up until she left and it was weird, she still acted as if she loved me but also like she had to do this. You don‚Äôt treat someone you love like that. Then after she left, she started partying every night got really close to this guy and contact slowed. I was in ruins at this point. I was a pathetic mess. I would still text her missing her and telling her that, even though it was against my better judgment. She eventually sent me pictures of her and her new man 2 months later. I was texting her and talking shit on her new guy so I‚Äôm not going to act like I‚Äôm innocent in all of this but she continued to say how for 2 years she was so lost with me and how her eyes have been opened and will never go back to me. She was telling me how he fucks her so good and how he‚Äôs tall and has tattoos and all of this mess. Which I think wasn‚Äôt en equivalent response, They weren‚Äôt and aren‚Äôt dating but she still flexed it on me. Obviously this sort of made me snap back into reality, It pushed me to do better for myself and during this whole period I was doing that but still like almost loosing my mind. Months later I have little to no contact with her, I have new friends and reconnected with old friends. I still feel as if I‚Äôm not over it, I feel alone all the time even when I‚Äôm having fun with friends or at a party. I don‚Äôt feel any interest in any of the girls I talk to so I don‚Äôt talk to them really unless they‚Äôre already established friends, Ik i‚Äôm not gay so talking to guys wouldn‚Äôt work either lol. Anyways I just want someone to love me as mush as I love them. I know my family loves me but I want to be special to someone. The only time I‚Äôve ever felt calm and relaxed was with my ex, I don‚Äôt want her back but since she left and even when I was with her and previous to her. I struggled with mental health but now it‚Äôs worse than ever, I deal with thoughts of suicide almost daily but Ik I will never go through with it as Im a brother a son and a friend and I have people that care about me. Even then I can‚Äôt help but think thoughts so selfish I can‚Äôt bring up with anyone else. It‚Äôs gotten pretty bad though, This kid in my physio class unfortunately passed away Wednesday in a head on collision. This was a good young man, an aspiring EMT who I have met since he signed me off on my long bone stabilization skills sheet. I digress, since the crash all I can think about is why couldn‚Äôt it have been me. I doubt he wanted to die. He could still be here and I could‚Äôve gotten what I wanted. Thinking like this scares me because his death is real as can be and I want to swap places with him. Throughout all of this I have felt alone, trapped in my head doing the right steps to get out but It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm a bug in a pitcher plant trying in vein to escape. My tale is as old as time so I‚Äôll be fine but I‚Äôm scared I will never feel love. That I will never have children of my own, I have doubts if I even deserve to be loved if I can‚Äôt even begin to love myself. I‚Äôm at a loss. I feel as if I just need to do something. Might even pull a Christopher McCandless and disappear for a while but that‚Äôs not realistic. Anyway I doubt anyone will read this but I just needed to have the relief of telling someone. \n\nI‚Äôm aware of the spelling is awful and all over the place but I can‚Äôt change anything unless I backspace to those mistakes since I‚Äôm on my phone and I don‚Äôt feel like doing that lol.",

    "selftext": "\n\nI wasn‚Äôt always this lonely. There was a time when my phone would buzz constantly, plans were made, laughs were shared, and life felt like an endless road of possibilities. But now, at 25, I sit alone in a tiny apartment, surrounded by silence so loud it feels suffocating.\n\nIt all started a few years ago when I moved to this city for my first real job. I thought this was my chance to start over‚Äîto build a life I could be proud of. I left behind my small-town friends, my family, and the comfort of familiarity, convincing myself that I was doing the right thing.\n\nThe first few months were exciting. I explored the city, worked late nights chasing deadlines, and told myself the loneliness was temporary. \"You‚Äôll make friends soon,\" I whispered to my reflection. But weeks turned into months, and soon, the only voice I heard regularly was the automated one on my work emails.\n\nI tried. I really did. I joined a book club, smiled at strangers in coffee shops, and forced myself to attend office get-togethers even when anxiety screamed for me to stay home. But somehow, I always felt like I was on the outside looking in‚Äîlike everyone already had their people, and there was no room for someone like me.\n\nThen last month, something happened that shattered me. My birthday came and went without a single call. Not from the friends I thought I‚Äôd always have, not from colleagues who‚Äôd laughed at my jokes, not even from distant relatives who usually remembered because of Facebook reminders. I sat on the couch that night with a store-bought cupcake and a single candle, trying not to cry. But the tears came anyway.\n\nThe worst part? I couldn‚Äôt even blame anyone. Life gets busy, people move on, and maybe I didn‚Äôt try hard enough. Maybe I wasn‚Äôt interesting enough, funny enough, or worth remembering.\n\nThe next morning, I called my mom. I told her I was fine, that work was great, and I had so many exciting plans lined up. She didn‚Äôt question it, and I was grateful. I didn‚Äôt want her to worry. But deep down, I wished someone would ask, ‚ÄúAre you really okay?‚Äù I wished someone would see through my mask and just sit with me in the silence.\n\nIt‚Äôs strange, isn‚Äôt it? We‚Äôre more connected than ever, but I feel like I‚Äôm drifting further away from everyone. I don‚Äôt even know why I‚Äôm writing this. Maybe I‚Äôm hoping someone out there will read it and understand. Maybe someone else feels like this too, and we can remind each other that we‚Äôre not alone.\n\nI‚Äôm not looking for pity or advice. I just needed to share this, to let it out. And if you‚Äôve made it this far, thank you. Truly. Sometimes, knowing someone is listening‚Äîeven for a moment‚Äîis enough to keep going.",

    "title": "25, no friends, never had a boyfriend before‚Ä¶ loneliest I‚Äôve ever been.",
    "selftext": "I‚Äôm 25 and don‚Äôt have any friends.\n\nSince I was young, my friendships have always been rocky; through secondary school, sixth form, and even uni. I can admit, back in my younger years, I was immature and didn‚Äôt always handle situations well. I wasn‚Äôt cruel or mean, but I was childish, avoidant, and a poor communicator - plus a chronic people pleaser.\n\nLooking back, I realise I‚Äôve always attracted mean, envious, and spiteful people who pretended to be friends. In secondary school, my so-called friends would call me ugly, hit me, trip me up; I was basically friends with bullies. Being a people pleaser, I didn‚Äôt stand up for myself and let anyone treat me however they liked because I feared being alone and craved approval.\n\nFor years, I thought I was the problem, so I tried to be the most genuine, supportive friend I could be - just people-pleasing in another form. But even in sixth form, my new group of friends was cold and standoffish. I felt like an outsider. Whenever I planned meet-ups or outings, I‚Äôd get ghosted or stood up - even on my birthday. Meanwhile, they‚Äôd go out of their way to make time for each other. One of these friends would take my ideas for fun activities and do them with her other friends and exclude me. While the other used to scream in my face and embarrass me in front of people, knowing I was too quiet and softspoken to defend myself.\n\nAt uni, I tried again, but while these friends weren‚Äôt cruel, they‚Äôd exclude me on purpose, and it hurt. That‚Äôs when I started keeping to myself and realised I had to address my people-pleasing tendencies.\n\nBy my second year, I moved in with housemates after living in a studio flat my first year. I thought this would help with making friends! At first, two of the girls seemed lovely, but they ganged up on me, and one even physically assaulted me over a disagreement about cleaning. The other threatened to when I asked her politely to turn her music down. I later found out they‚Äôd bullied another housemate so badly the year before that she ended up in a psychiatric hospital.\n\nIt‚Äôs been traumatising. I‚Äôve had friends lie about me, spread rumours, hit me, even try to sabotage my life. In secondary school, one friend hacked my school account and deleted my GCSE coursework right before submission and I even failed one of my GCSEs because of this. Another friend I met in secondary, years after we left school tried to set me up to be SA‚Äôd. This even goes back to primary school, where a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù trapped me behind a shed while boys tried to SA me.\n\nI‚Äôve tried making friends online too, but it‚Äôs been just as bad. One girl I met online during my first year of uni drugged me on my birthday and left me for dead. Another time, I met two sisters online during my final year who I later discovered went to my uni, we met up and they seemed nice until they eventually became competitive and jealous.\n\nNow, at 25, I‚Äôm exhausted. I don‚Äôt have anyone I can call or text - just a few people I occasionally chat with online. My phone is dry every single day. In the last I‚Äôve always at least has one friend, even if they weren‚Äôt genuine, but it felt comforting to have someone there, now this is the loneliest I‚Äôve ever felt. My family recently moved to a new town, so I‚Äôm in an unfamiliar place and don‚Äôt know anyone. And honestly, I‚Äôm scared to meet new people, whether in person or online.\n\nWhat hurts the most is that after meeting so many people over the years, I‚Äôve never made a genuine friend. And after reflecting, I know I‚Äôm not the issue. I‚Äôve never intentionally harmed anyone, never done anything cruel like drugging or physically hurting someone. I‚Äôve always been kind and supportive, but in return, people have been unnecessarily cruel. I think being bullied when I was younger made me an easy target. People haven‚Äôt respected me, and my people-pleasing hasn‚Äôt helped - it‚Äôs made me easier to take advantage of. I‚Äôm trying to heal and improve, but it‚Äôs hard.\n\nAll I‚Äôve ever wanted is a solid, genuine group of girlfriends - just real friends, but I‚Äôve only ever been met with cattiness, jealousy, and spite. I hate it because I know how amazing it is to have true friendships, seeing and hearing other experiences. It doesn‚Äôt help that social media exists - seeing people go on fun trips, holidays and events with their friends and I‚Äôve got no one. \n\nI know it may sound sad but I have a list on my phone or things I‚Äôve always wanted to do with friends like skiing, sky diving, holidays, roller skating, paint balling, cabin getaways, pottery classes and more! I have tried to do things by myself without friends like going to the cinema or concerts when I can, as I don‚Äôt want to put my life on hold, but some things are genuinely so much better with a group of friends.\n\nI‚Äôve also never been in a romantic relationship before. I‚Äôm just so lonely, I feel like I have no one. \n\nDoes it get better or am I destined to go through life alone?",

    "selftext": "Let me start off by prefacing by saying I (22F) have a few close and genuine friends, yet I feel so isolated and lonely. Not to mention my romantic life is and pretty much always has been non existent. \n\nI grew up in a community where dating was only for those ready to marry, so that has severely impacted my ability to flirt and create romantic relationships \n\nAnd I‚Äôm trying so damn hard. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm sitting on my ass doing nothing and complaining. But being ugly really does impact the first impression you make. People say it‚Äôs what‚Äôs on the inside that counts, but people are fall less likely to want to find out what someone‚Äôs ‚Äúinside‚Äù is like when the outside is hard to look at. \n\nAnd when I say I‚Äôm ugly, I‚Äôm not beating myself up, I‚Äôm just stating facts. I can go from head to toe and there are maybe three things about my physical appearance that can be considered ‚Äúattractive‚Äù. If I were to go through that list, I think I would run out of characters for a post, and then have 75% of the list still not written.\n\nNot to mention I‚Äôve only ever been attracted to people far out of my league. To preface my next statement, I think the number rating way of ranking people‚Äôs appearances is reductive and shallow, but it‚Äôs pretty funny how a 3 (me) has only ever been attracted to 6+. Even then, there are people who are uglier than I am (internally and/or externally) who are in happy long term relationships. Cements my theory that I‚Äôm the common denominator in all this. \n\nThe only outlet I have for potentially meeting new people is apps, which I can go on a whole separate rant about, but maybe a different time. And I know that keeping my hopes up is never a good idea, the second I match with someone, I get far too excited. Not to mention almost every match without fail, has gone something like this \n\nI send a message, they respond, I respond, they respond, I respond, then I get ghosted/unmatched. I have no other choice but to think I‚Äôm the problem.\n\nI‚Äôve tried going to events and socializing, even to just try and expand my social circle beyond one friend, but they never work out. I start a conversation, we talk for a bit, exchange social medias, I dm them saying something along the lines of ‚Äúit was nice to meet you‚Äù and I‚Äôm either left on read or delivered\n\nAnd the worst part is, I haven‚Äôt given up when the universe/god/whoever or whatever has given me clear signs that it‚Äôs time to give up. It‚Äôs like going ice skating knowing that you will fall, but deluding yourself into thinking that this time will be different. And when you fall, you get hurt. And instead of giving the wound time to heal, you get right back on that ice thinking this time it will be different. It won‚Äôt be. It never has been\n\nI just want to wake up one day in someone‚Äôs arms, while they reassure me that things will be ok, but it‚Äôll be easier for me to win the lottery 10 times in a row before that happens. \n\nEven being happy is too much to ask for ",

Okay back to the present: I had a straight friend who recently told me he was bi now, he still has a girlfriend but he gave me his number, and we chatted late, I told him I really liked him and he said he liked me a little too, but was still in a relationship currently. Good news, he said if they broke up he would text me, and I really haven't seen him and his girlfriend together, like only once or twice. Want the best for him and for him to be happy but also I'm hoping for a breakup... I don't know if I'm a bad person or not though, he's just so cute and I've known him for years.

    "title": "I don't Understand What I am Doing Wrong",
    "selftext": "As Thom Yorke once sang, \"I'm not living, I'm just killing time\".\n\nI have childhood trauma (parental neglect, conditional love, emotional abuse, emotional manipulation, bullying, etc.) from my parents that made a difficult constantly-moving lifestyle really hard on my ability to make friends. On top of that I'm naturally introverted, and most of the friendships I have had I made a mistake I didn't realize was a mistake, which was unforgivable apparently. In high school I struggled to find a place amongst my peers, eventually finding one but still being emotionally abused within it.\n\nAll of this to say, I'm a very emotionally, socially, and romantically vulnerable person. I'm naturally sensitive but trauma makes emotional regulation feel like I'm constantly wrangling a bull.\n\nAfter some particularly devastating experiences some years ago, I have taken that time until now to be more dedicating to understand, and fortify, and heal, and develop myself. I'm learning to dress better, I'm learning to take better care of myself (being conscious of calories, and skin care routine), I'm learning to communicate and listen better, I'm learning to understand and trade with stocks, I'm building very good credit, I finally have some sort of concrete career plan moving forward, and I'm learning to carry myself with a greater presence and confidence, all while still respecting the things I know I enjoy regardless of what I think society thinks about them (passions for art, writing, people, nature, etc.).\n\nAnd yet...\n\nNobody approaches me, ever, when I do flirt and get someone's number they assume I want to be friends or forget me entirely, nearly every single date I've managed to land has cancelled with almost identical reasons, and nobody ever seems to even notice me. With how much dedication I'm trying to give myself, and how much I have felt I've grown, \\*STILL\\* I'm just...nothing to everyone. I'm just...nothing. And it feels like such a waste of time to learn to be a better more rounded person if literally nobody wants me around or is interested in who \\*I\\* am.\n\nI just don't understand what I am supposed to do to be considered valuable or worthy of attention anymore. I'm definitely not overweight, I always go out of my way to be kind and generous, I always pay attention to the people I see getting the least, I always do my absolute best to be openly considerate of others, I always do my best to make sure people have what they need to feel comfortable, but I'm just walked all over or through.\n\nI don't work out actively, I'm not outdoorsy, I don't drive, I don't have a lot of money (I'm a student), I'm not tall (5'8\"), I don't have any tattoos (yet), I don't drink a lot or like large parties....these are the only things that I can think of that delineate me from everyone else. I don't want most of those things because I don't feel that they are a part of who I am and I am unwilling to change myself in unwanted ways just to get attention; because then the attention is only for the concept of myself attached to that particular thing (a muscular guy...who is also myself, for example).\n\nI get zero attention, zero interest, I just get nothing. It makes me feel absolutely worthless, and I feel like a joke when I'm paying careful attention to how I'm dressing so it looks attractive, or when I'm reading a book that informs me of different communication styles people and especially women have (I'm male and interested in women, mainly).\n\nI just don't get it and it tears me apart. I can't help but believe I'm simply not valuable, no matter how hard I try I'll never be attractive or interesting or a valuable consideration for someone. I know that I'll for sure never be as attractive as the ugliest tall guy, not that appearance is everything but women consistently tolerate awful guys simply because they're tall; it's something I see every single day, and I'm sure not all of them are awful but my point is that if you have height, it allows women to forgive \\*SO\\* much, let alone tolerate or even consider it.\n\nI'm really seriously feeling like just giving up and shooting myself or hanging myself. I just don't feel like I have any place anywhere, and no one out there who would even want to love me, let alone put effort into a relationship with me.\n\nIt's all so hopeless and pointless, but I've always been willing to die to have a healthy love in my life. Just someone who values me or wants me or needs me or feels safe or comfortable with me. Just someone who is my best friend that can also share a private intimacy with. I just feel like there's nothing for me, and that I am nothing to anybody and everybody. Trying just feels like a joke and I have never experienced a reason to keep trying, merely just the promise that it \\*MAY\\* get better. I'm just so tired, so so tired, and I don't know what to do or how to think or how to feel or how to move forward anymore. The worst part is that feeling so desperate just to be loved and wanted actually harms my ability to even present myself well or emotionally regulate but I can't turn it off, I just can't. I've spent the better part of a decade trying to and I just can't.\n\nI'm totally, and completely, dead.",

    "selftext": "I moved across the country back to my hometown in 2020 when my girlfriend at the time was pregnant.  She wanted to be closer to family and I agreed for her sake and to be able to help my sick/aging mother. So we got married and bought a house here.  \n\nFast forward to a little over a year ago and my mother passed away pretty suddenly. I had a hard time dealing with it the first few months which caused my wife to find solace in another man. I know I was distant for a bit, but the fact that she gave up on me after just a few rough months when I suddenly had to take care of everything after my mom's death hurt bad. I saw their relationship blossom and I tried so hard to stop it. That just pushed us further apart. Then at the end of October just 4 days before the 1 year anniversary of when she died my wife left me for the man that was \"just a friend\". This guy lives a couple houses down from the house I inherited and live in now. \n\nWe have a 4 year old son and I have half custody of him. He's the only reason i still get uo every day, but I'm also stuck living someplace I hate because of it. I moved back here for my wife and to help my mother. Within a year my mother died and my wife left me. Now I've never been more lonely in my life. I have a few friends I can count on thankfully, but any of the rest of my family lives across the country from me now so I barely get to see them. \n\nI live in basically the middle of nowhere so there is no place to go out and meet people. Dating feels like it's going to be impossible. I feel I'm just going to be stuck miserable and alone for the next 14 years until I can sell my house and move elsewhere and it's very numbing to think about. \nShe got everything she wanted from me. A paid off house, a paid off vehicle, and a son. I was a good husband and father. It feels like even if I do everything right 99% of the time that I can't ever go through anything or show emotion without judgment, ridicule, and abandonment.",

    "selftext": "Heads up, this will be a long one.\n\nNow, I want to preface this by saying that I know to some of you, my words might sound self-explanatory. But I also know there are people who might need to read this as a reminder or just as a different perspective on loneliness.\n\nA bit of personal context first: From 17-19, I was in a very bad place mentally, with loneliness playing a big role in it. Honestly, I was so out of touch that I couldn't handle or even form social connections at the time. A bit later at 19, I had a big change in environment (finished school), which alleviated a lot of stress, though the crushing loneliness remained.\n\nWhen I started Uni at 20, to my disappointment, most people seemed disinterested in socializing, despite my efforts. And after realizing that wasn‚Äôt working, I shifted my focus to how this situation could help me grow. This led me to some deep self-reflection, where I learned to identify flaws in my mindset and approach. For example, I used to get too attached to new people almost immediately, and became more conscious of this tendency.\n\nThrough this reflection, I gained a very valuable shift in mindset. I started to see random, fleeting conversations for what they were, instead of putting heavy expectations on them and setting myself up for disappointment. At 21, I finally managed to fully incorporate this awareness into my daily interactions, which led to stress-free, brief social exchanges; an incredibly freeing feeling.\n\nTrust me, it‚Äôs fine if some small interactions don‚Äôt lead to anything more than just that. If they do, that‚Äôs amazing! If they don‚Äôt, so be it; we can always try again. I hope this perspective gives some people a nudge to re-evaluate the way they see and handle their own loneliness.\n\nBless you all, and I hope you have a good one!\n\n\nPs: I know this doesn't guarantee to get friends, nor should you have to change for the sake of others. But it might make your loneliness more bearable and your mind a bit more pleasant.",

Why try anything? we are all lost... we cry, we get sad we live, but there is no perfect answer for anything. ppl starve ppl lose their homes... & the rest of us are never happy.\n\nthe inner madness of the human brain will always hold loneliness within its mysteries of the unknown. yesterday my day sucked a week ago my day sucked...& things will continue to be that way as I will never be happy. The medical world is struggling to keep enough beds in hospitals.... World leaders dont care about me or you & the climate is getting worse.\n\nWith the shi\\* i see in the world idk what to do.... I'll never be happy or find someone, hell I don't even wanna pay for taxes, apartment fees, gas prices, or food. some days I wish i was dead ;=; it fking sucks... Idk what to do to take the mind off of all these heavy emotions & stressors. Wish I could just disappear... like dust.",

The truth is that I only really matter at work, and if I didn't wake up in the morning I would just be replaced on Tuesday and thatbis only because I am off on Monday due to the inauguration. I'm good at the job, but if I was gone, I'm just replaceable. I have no real family or friends, save an elderly mother I am taking care of and I have dogs. The people I have as \"friends\" are really just two or three people I have or still work with, and they would just move on if I weren't around, and I would expect nothing less. I know I will spend the rest of my days alone and without real and meaningful connections to the world or others, and not gonna lie it does make me a bit jaded and bitter. I won't act like that in public though, as it is rude, but I feel it all the same.

    "selftext": "Straight to my story. I had a long distance relationship some time ago, but we could never meet, because the distance was absurd (other side of the planet literally). We still had a good relationship and where deeply in love, but she couldnt handle the distance long and became depressive. This hold on for months and at the end, we had to breakup, although we both wanted to be together. We had to leave eachother, knowing the relationship we wanted can never happen and we need to forget eachother. To cut all hope left, she left the internet completely and there is nothing of her left, not a trace. I cant reach out to her anymore, in my entire life. This was heartbreaking, for both of us and saying goodbye, probably forever, was one of the hardest moments of my life. I cried all day and night. This goodbye is 300 days ago now, nearly a year. She probably moved on by now, me only kind of. I moved on from hoping, we will be happy together someday. I accepted that bwe both need to get happy without eachother. Still, everytime I think of her (nearly everyday) I get sad and panic a bit. I still care for her and knowing her depressive episodes, I really want to know if she is doing fine. She is somewhere out there and I will never know if she is alright, or if we will ever know eachother again. I didnt delete my accounts so if she wants, she could contact me again, but I dont know if she ever will. I want to be friends with her again someday. I can accept, that we stop loving eachother, but someday, I need to hear of her again. Many friends say, I need to forget her, stop missing her and stop caring for her. I wish I could, but its not that easy. I cant simply erase her from my mind, but missing her makes me sad. Any tips on how to cope with this?",

    "selftext": "I'm 20 years old, I live alone and work 70 hours a week. I got kicked out of my family's house at 17 and moved 1000 miles away for college at 18. Then I dropped out and got a job as a waitress and a shitty apartment. Honesly, I'm happy with the life I've built for myself and I have more than I ever knew was possible as a child coming from poverty, abuse, and homelessness. But I am so fucking lonely. \n\nI had one friend in high school, I am autistic and didn't know how/ care too much about making more friends at the time. We stopped talking when we graduated because I had been raped a few months prior and she couldn't handle the person I became after that. I don't blame her, and relationships end all of the time. I met a lot of people and had a lot of good relationships once I went to college, though. I had a whole group of people who knew me and who I liked. But then my sophomore year I had a mental breakdown from PTSD. I couldn't really stay at that college, so I dropped out. I had a huge falling out with my best friend at the time because she felt like she was contributing more to the friendship than I was at the time. I don't understand that because of the times in which I was there for her during her rough patches and it's not like I did anything bad to her, but once again I understand not wanting that burden. I don't blame her, she had her own struggles and she needed to prioritize herself. \n\nI get along with the people at my job, but I'm young in comparison to most of them. The ones older than me have established lives and families of their own so while I have relationships I cherish deeply with them, it's not like we can hang out or anything. It's too awkward with the few people there who are my age because I'm their boss. I'm glad I have made advancements in my career and especially at a young age it's great, but in this regard it sucks man. \n\nI was supposed to have dinner with an old friend from college the other day, but she cancelled last minute because she had to study. Then I see pictures on her social media of her having dinner with other people. I get it, I really do understand and I don't expect much else. But it still hurts. \n\nMy last attempt at dating turned into an abusive relationship and I ended things, I miss him sometimes but I know better than to go back. When someone chokes you, you don't look back. I don't know why I miss him. \n\nNobody really knows how lonely I am. I get along with people and they like me on the superficial basis they see me, on the outside I look pretty happy and ok. But I don't have anyone. And I don't know how to change that. \n\n\nMy birthday is Sunday and I'm the manager on duty that day. They asked me to cover the shift and it's not like I had anything to do. I'm making everyone cupcakes. I think it'll be nice and a good memory, I'm so fucking grateful for what I have. But it hurts knowing that's all it'll be.",

    "selftext": "Lately, I‚Äôve been reflecting on how challenging loneliness can feel, especially during big life changes like a career shift, significant relationships ending, or other personal struggles. I‚Äôve been there, and I know how isolating it can be.\n\nOne thing that really helped me was shifting how I used social media. Instead of passively scrolling, I started actively engaging with online communities‚Äîcommenting, participating in discussions, and making connections. Research even shows that meaningful online interactions can foster a sense of belonging, while passive use often worsens feelings of loneliness.\n\n‚Äú...the type of engagement, not just the time spent on it, is a key factor in whether social media has an effect on loneliness.‚Äù ([source](https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/jrc-news-and-updates/how-you-scroll-matters-passive-social-media-use-linked-loneliness-2024-12-13_en))¬†so if you're a long-time lurker, I encourage you to start leaving comments, you never know where it'll lead.\n\nAnother thing that helped was stepping out of my comfort zone to join a local group. I signed up for a class on something I‚Äôd always wanted to try, and not only did it distract me in a healthy way, but it also introduced me to people with shared interests. Studies suggest that participating in group activities can significantly improve social well-being and reduce feelings of isolation ([source](https://www.psu.edu/news/health-and-human-development/story/how-reduce-loneliness-meaningful-activities-can-improve-health)).\n\n\n\nI‚Äôd love to hear from you in the comments below:\n\n**What‚Äôs one thing that‚Äôs helped you feel less lonely?** It could be something small or big, personal or general‚Äîwhatever worked for you.\n\nLooking forward to hearing your stories, Reddit friends. üíõ\n\n",

    "title": "Does anyone else feel like just giving up?",
    "selftext": "I want to preface this by saying that I‚Äôm not going to do anything stupid, I just need somewhere to get these thoughts out of my head. \n\nMy auntie died in mid November and I‚Äôve struggled ever since. She was 91 and I‚Äôm 24. I‚Äôm not naive- I knew she wouldn‚Äôt be here forever, but I didn‚Äôt expect it to happen the way that it did. She‚Äôs been gone for 9 weeks, and it‚Äôs been the longest and hardest time of my life. \n\nI lived with her for the past 3 years and she was the person I was closest to. We got on so well and she was such a good, genuine person. She always tried to see the positive side of life and she taught me things I‚Äôll carry with me forever. She was the first person I‚Äôve ever truly considered as my family, because she showed me love that I‚Äôd never had before.\n\nI‚Äôve never fit in with anyone and she‚Äôs the first person who ever understood me. She actually took the time to listen to me and not disregard what I said or fake an interest. Since she‚Äôs been gone, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve properly spoken about anything, because I know that no one really cares. I can tell no one knows what to say to me, and it‚Äôs not because of the loss, they just generally don‚Äôt have a clue what to talk to me about. Me and my auntie used to laugh everyday, and I haven‚Äôt genuinely laughed or smiled at anything since. Now, when I speak to someone, it‚Äôs just fake smiles, small talk and pleasantries.\n\nI then lost my job in late December. Although I only had a part time minimum wage job, it was a great distraction from everything, as well as giving me an income. It also allowed me to socialise and speak to other people, even if it was just about surface level things. Now, I spend every day stuck in the house we shared thinking about the same things over and over again. I‚Äôve always loved music, so I spend my days listening to it to try and fill the silence. I can go days not speaking to anyone. With having no job, I don‚Äôt have spare money to go out, unless it‚Äôs for something important. I don‚Äôt know what to do with myself. Every day is so long. \n\nI try to be productive whilst I‚Äôm stuck at home, but nothing stops me thinking about my reality and the past leading up to it. I went out into town for some shopping and a walk the other day. As much as it was good to be in the fresh air and have a change of scene, I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about everything. I try to distract myself because I hate thinking about what my life is now. I know trying to block it all out isn‚Äôt a long term solution, but I‚Äôm finding it hard to cope with the situation, and I wish my brain would just shut off sometimes. I do want things to get better, but most days I just feel like giving up. \n\nI know you should never be co dependent on someone else, but I have no motivation to get myself out of this rut for my own sake. I don‚Äôt have that drive to keep myself going. In the few months before she died, my life had revolved more around my auntie. I would work, then come home and spend time with her, helping her with anything she needed. I didn‚Äôt mind doing this at all, as she always did whatever she could for me, and I enjoyed her company. On the days I didn‚Äôt want to get out of bed for myself, she gave me a reason to. Everyday now, I question why I‚Äôm getting up. There‚Äôs nothing to be happy about and nothing to look forward to. Everything that could be vaguely good and positive seems far fetched and unobtainable. Going forward, if I end up never having people around me to be by my side as we try and navigate life together, what is the point in trying to stick out a life that seems so isolating and lonely? I just want to be wanted by somebody and not have to fundamentally change myself. I get these waves of determination where I want to get my life together, make the effort, make my auntie proud. They‚Äôre few and far between though, and I always end up questioning why I‚Äôm bothering.\n\nI‚Äôm so alone and lonely. Before I moved in with my auntie, I always felt like I was going through life alone, and would continue to do so. It still bothered me back then, but it was all I had ever known, so I‚Äôd just come to accept it. As much as I‚Äôm so grateful for the time I had with my auntie, now that I know what love and belonging feels like, I can‚Äôt bear not to have it again. Please don‚Äôt tell me that I‚Äôm young and still have loads of time to find people, because I‚Äôm finding it so hard to comprehend being alone for any extended period of time. I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôm never going to find anyone else who will take the time to get to know me and really get me. It would be nice if somebody liked having me around and actually enjoyed my company. One of the things my auntie made me realise is that life is about making memories and sharing them with the people you love. I have nobody anymore. The people left in my life either want to control what I do or only speak to me to try and get something from me. To me, that equates to having no one, because they‚Äôre not there because they actually want to be or for the right reasons. I feel like I‚Äôm a burden to them, because no one ever seems happy to see me- more like I‚Äôm just a problem that needs fixing. My phone is so dry, I don‚Äôt even know why I have one. I can go all day and night and not get a single message. If I disappeared tomorrow, I don‚Äôt think anyone would notice for awhile.\n\nThe right thing for me to do is to move forward as best I can. I‚Äôm scared of moving forward in some ways, because although I know things will never be the same again, I‚Äôm still longing for a life with my auntie in it that I can‚Äôt have. I sometimes feel by taking this step, I‚Äôm leaving her behind. I don‚Äôt want to forget her, and I know I never will, but I‚Äôm being forced to move on from the time I was the happiest. In my head, I‚Äôm not ready to accept that and give it up yet. Everyone around me seems to have moved on, as if they‚Äôre saying because she was old, that it‚Äôs ok. I don‚Äôt care what anyone says- just because someone‚Äôs older and has had a good life, it doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt miss them and want them back.\n\nI‚Äôm trying to find some form of happiness again. I want to go out and experience life, but I don‚Äôt want to be all alone. I made a promise to my auntie that I would be happy.

Why do they all have to look like hot models with tiny waists and six packs, instead of just regular people with regular lives? Hot people don‚Äôt even require the aid that these shows provide because all they have to do in the real world is flaunt it once, and people will come running over. But ugly people like us?

If that is your *only* problem as an attractive person ‚Äî that you‚Äôre unable to find love because people only want you for your looks ‚Äî you‚Äôre absolutely fucking wrong.

I'm tired of the only time I'm happy is any other time other than being conscious and aware I'm alive.\n\nIts all so tiresome, and the worst part is I know it'll never end. I realized I've been different since middle school, ive wanted to die since middle school, ive been told all of the optimistic platitudes  since middle school. Im 25. It's not going to stop. I'm just gonna suffer until it's over. So tiresome",

Even as a child, I was always the \"lone\" wolf.\n\nI retired 5 years ago and loved my party. It was awesome having people say goodbye and feeling included. But after that, no one checked up on me or even said anything to me after that day. \n\nMy family like mother, father, siblings, died many years ago. It's now just me.\n\nI realized I worked myself to death and never had a life. Never went on any trips, never met a wonderful man and had children.

You are 30 and never had a gf/bf and never could date or lose your virginity. They say ‚ÄútHeRe‚ÄôS mOrE tO LiFe tHaN sEx aNd dAtInG‚Äù and these are the people who get depressed over a breakup or who won‚Äôt date a virgin because they cannot handle teaching you or who get dates regularly and don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs like in your shoes\n\nYou tell them you never made friends and are socially isolated and others have pics of them doing fun stuff online they say ‚Äúbut but those are just the highlights‚Äù even though their highlights are far more exciting than anything that occurs in your life and then they say ‚ÄúBuT yOu dOn‚ÄôT kNoW wHaT gOeS oN iN tHeIr LiFe hOw Do yOu kNoW ThEy‚ÄôRe hApPy?‚Äù And how do you know they‚Äôre just as miserable? Some might be miserable but a majority I‚Äôm sure are pretty happy and definitely way happier than an extrovert who is socially isolated with an uneventful life.\n\nThey tell us that friends, social events etc aren‚Äôt that fun and we aren‚Äôt missing much even though people throw these events to celebrate special holidays or their birthday. For example, if parties are boring, why do people go them all the time including after trying them out for the first time? If they sucked they wouldn‚Äôt go over and over again? Why would they throw them when celebrating a holiday or graduation or their own birthday? If hanging out with your friends isn‚Äôt so fun why do people do it so much? If concerts and bars aren‚Äôt fun why do people go to them all the time? \n\nInstead of helping you make new friends or find a partner or go to a fun event like a concert they just trivialize your problems.\n\nThese are the same people who went insane under quarantine. At least they had friends and a social life prior to covid while a lot of people here never did. And despite being unable to handle the tip of the iceberg of what socially isolated people dealt with they gave the audacity to trivialize our problems \n\nThis is why depressed or lonely or suicidal people don‚Äôt get help. Even if they knew you won‚Äôt stigmatize them for being depressed they still won‚Äôt talk to you knowing you‚Äôll gaslight them or trivialize their problems. \n\nThis is why the suicide rate and depression rate has skyrocketed despite campaigns and people ‚Äútrying‚Äù to prevent suicide/depression.",

I felt like she could've talked to anyone else and gotten a lot more from them, but she seemed to enjoy talking to me and I did too.

    "title": "My teens and 20s are gone, I grew old without ever having lived and I'm terrified I won't be able to salvage what's left of my life.",
    "selftext": "I turned 27 on the 15th, so not quite 30 yet, but with how fast these 7 years have flown by I know I'll be there soon. I haven't had any real friends in about 15 years and I've never even kissed a girl. I get along with people fine, no one really ever dislikes me. Hell, I even get praised for how well I can read and empathize with people. But despite that, I am completely unable to form any deep connection with anybody. Due to circumstance, and then later anxiety, I was pretty much completely socially isolated between the ages of 13 and 23. Because of this, I missed out on a lot of formative experiences, and this makes it almost impossible for me to relate to those around me. I often feel like I'm not really a person, like I'm some kind of anomalous entity that appeared from nothing with no past behind me and seemingly no future ahead. That 10-year gap is just a blur to me, I honestly can't pick out a single event. The only I got from it is weird interests and tastes in media that I have a lot of trouble opening up about, making it even harder to connect to people. And from the other direction, when people try to open up to me, I'm never able to relate to their interests. I'm just too far removed from the modern zeitgeist.\n\nThe thing is, I thought I was doing better. But now it all feels like it's falling apart. I started a new job about two years ago and, unlike my last job, I made a lot of casual work friends but I still couldn't form any real relationships. Whenever I suggested we do something outside work there would be some reason it couldn't happen. And the few times anyone did agree something would always come up, or they would conveniently \"forget\" despite me confirming the plans the day before. I would get \"vibed\" out of group conversations for my inability to relate, usually by suggesting I go work on something while everyone else continued to chat. But the real wake up call came on my birthday. I was falling into a bad depression and I turned to the person I thought I was the closest to only for them to get angry at me for slacking and putting all the work on them. And this after I had covered for them more times than I can count without them ever doing the same in return. They then told me that they would listen to my problems \"as long as it would get me to work harder\". This was on my birthday by the way, and the only thing I got was a store-bought cupcake from my manager, despite me having gotten several of my coworkers birthday gifts in the past. I felt so betrayed at first, but after giving it some thought I came to the realization that none of these people were actually my friends. They were in my life out of work obligation, not choice. So desperate I am for human connection that I was inflating these casual acquaintances into personal friends. And it was this overbearing desperation that was getting me shunned more than anything else. I'm so mortified by this realization that I have since become completely withdrawn. I am now in the worst depression of my life. It's hard to get out of bed, let alone make it through a workday. And I've completely lost my ability to work on any of my personal goals or hobbies.\n\nThe thing is, I honestly couldn't care less about what my coworkers think of me. I just want someone to talk to, that I can share things with. And I want a girlfriend, someone I can hold and love. I want to be able to be there for people and know that they're there for me. I want to be wanted, and I want to belong. And I have no idea how to help myself. I don't know where to go or what to do, especially with the world on fire like it is. And now on top of everything else, I don't know if I can even form normal relationships being as desperate as I am.\n\nToday was my day off, I spent the whole thing dreading tomorrow. I have no idea how I'm going to muster the strength to make it through another workday. I wouldn't say I'm suicidal, but I feel so cornered, I understand now how someone could be. I just want to get my life together before it's too late\n\n**e: Thank you to everyone for your responses, you really made a difference. I'm honestly feeling a lot better about things for the first time in over a week. And thank you to the people who messaged me through chat who I haven't been able to respond to yet. I need to get some sleep now, but I hope you all have a great night.**",

I'm not trying to brag, but I know my worth and I know my weaknesses. Only a few know though how I feel deep down. \n\nI've really been trying to put myself out there. All dating apps in the book, sports clubs, parties, friends of friends. Ever since my last ex left (4 years ago) I haven't even been close to having a boyfriend again. And it's not because I never like anyone. In the past four years, I've probably really liked about 10 different guys (even had feelings for  few) and in the end they never wanted me. They would date me, sleep with me and then they would tell me they don't want anything serious. And I'm not going for the typical douchebag looking guys. I've been disappointed again and again and still I tried to meet guys.\n\nWhen I was younger I always dreamed of having  family. A husband, kids and a dog. Now, at 32, this seems incredibly far away. A few months ago, I thought I got pregnant by a guy that I was seeing for about two months. How sad is it that I was almost hoping I was actually pregnant? Somehow I thought that this might be the only chance I'll ever have for having a child, even if I'd be a single Mom. \n\nAll of my single friends complained about not finding anyone, and yet they all found someone. I'm the only one who never did. My best friend can't believe it and says my love live is jinxed. I don't know anyone who's so incredibly unlucky with dating. At this point I'm a 100% sure I'll end up alone. I guess I'll have to accept that the best thing that I can get dating-wise is good sex and some companionship. And I hate that this makes me sad, but it just sometimes does.\n\nAnyone 30+ feeling the same?",

Im so broken, I have a gaping whole in my heart, while also feeling guilt and shame like it was my fault. He attempted twice before we were together, but since we were together on the successful attempt I look back at all the ways I didn‚Äôt listen enough, or told him we‚Äôd talk about it in a little while. He stayed with me and my son all weekend and then went to stay at his house Sunday. We video chatted around 10:30, he was upset about a few things, I could tell he‚Äôd been drinking, when he drank he was always emotional, so I had no idea it would lead to this. But I let him talk and told him I was there for him, I then had to go put our son in bed. Why didn‚Äôt I stay longer? I would‚Äôve talked to him all night. After we video chatted we didn‚Äôt talk ever again, his parents said he spoke with them sometime after midnight asking for forgiveness and then he went and done the act. I just don‚Äôt understand, and none of us ever will. I loved him so much, I viewed his body yesterday, I was shaking and terrified to go. When I think of suicide I had an extremely gory image in my head. He didn‚Äôt look like that image, he finally looked like he was at peace. I hugged him and kissed him and told him to wait for me. This life just isn‚Äôt fair. I‚Äôll never forgive myself for not doing more.  But we had a great weekend together üíî",

Whether it's the only thing that's missing, in which case it's the most natural thing in the world to want that, or everything generally sucks but would be made better with a supportive partner, it's perfectly valid to want it and even despair at not having it. We never hear, friends won't fix your life, a good career won't fix your life, eating well won't fix your life. Because it's absolutely insane. Anything good will enhance your quality of living. You just have to hold out for good things and not settle in their absence or difficulty in obtainability. \n\nAs a perpetually unhappy single woman, you want to know what probably sucks more than the status itself? People telling me I should be happy being independent. Ignoring how I feel on the matter. As if I'd need to sacrifice independence in a relationship. The condescension is *insulting*. Hating being unlucky in love is normal. Not everybody finds meaning in being single, or great mental health even if it's always important to make the attempt.

How can you get another human to do that with you. \n\nAnd given how hard it is to get girls, I'd think like 10% of guys would have a girlfriend/active sex life. And yet way more than that do. Actually around my age probably 95% do. \n\nIt's so painful. Sex is everywhere. I'm not able to do much IRL because I have no friends either, so I need to use media. But sex is EVERYWHERE on media and it's constantly reminders of things I'll probably never get. It's so painful feeling so worthless and unwanted. \n\nAnd there's this stigma about guys who can't get laid. They must have a bad personality or be horribly ugly. It's absolutely not true. I'm probably a 6 or 7/10 and my personality is fine. The only major problem I have is that i have no friends so I'm not really \"fun\" cause I don't get invited to stuff. So that really limits the type of girl I can date down to introverts. And due to years of isolation I'm pretty depressed too. But I'm still down-to-earth and such and always up for adventure.\n\nI'm trying to work out and stuff. I got my arms to be decently big. I'm gonna try losing 20 pounds and seeing if I can get abs. Maybe it'll help but I doubt it. Guys at my weight seem to have no problem with getting laid. I don't know what's wrong with me. And if a girl were with me just for abs then that's the wrong reasons.... I don't know what to do. Why is it so normal?! HOW can something SO impossible to achieve, be normal? Makes me wonder if this is a simulation and I'm being singled out for an experiment or something. But I suppose there are other guys in this situation. \n\nJust feels so unfair and there's no way to \"forget\" about sex because it's EVERYWHERE. Feels like we're just being teased constantly.\n\nEDIT: FOR CONTEXT. I'm not complaining about just not getting laid. I desperately want a relationship. A meaningful one. The fact media, and just about anyone I talk to keeps reminding me about sex is what's bothering me. I dislike how it's normal In society to talk about it so freely while guys like me (or even girls) can't get it. It's torture.",

    "selftext": "I just need to get things off my mind because I‚Äôm extremely numb.\n\nI‚Äôm a guy in my 20‚Äôs. I don‚Äôt have any friends. No one has ever had a crush on me or been in love with me, I‚Äôve never been flirted with, and I‚Äôve never been on a date.\n\nGrowing up, watching people around me find others (and having others find them) so effortlessly and easily always boggled my mind. I quickly began to realize that I was the odd one out when I was surrounded by people who had flocks of friends and lovers, never having to worry about being alone or lonely because they know that someone is thinking of them or loving them.\n\nNo one ever acted affectionately or playfully with me. No one gave me passing compliments or wanted to have anything more than a shallow greeting exchanged with me. I began to feel unworthy of friends or romantic partners due to how unwanted I was (and still am) no matter where I went. I tried very hard to simply relax and be myself, not trying to hard, not forcing anything, just trying to exist and socialize even if it was hard for me to do so on the levels people around me seemed to be at so naturally. Yet still, nothing but emptiness.\n\nI wasn‚Äôt invited to parties or outings. I do not usually enjoy those settings but I craved company to soothe the pain a little bit. There was one time (out of many, many experiences with failed friendships) when I thought I had made some friends and we were walking from a class building to a parking lot. I walked alongside them, making casual conversation as they discussed going to a restaurant. I was internally excited, I did not usually ever get invited to eat with friends. But before I could register what was happening they all quickly dispersed in their cars and left me in the empty parking lot. Realizing they ditched me, and that was them signaling I was unwanted, I tried not to cry as I walked back home.\n\nI know that I‚Äôm an undesirable person. It was foolish of me to expect anything hopeful.\n\nIt is the same thing in regard to anything romantic. It cuts me deep knowing that no one will ever think of me fondly, maybe even daydream about me for a few moments. That no one will ever look at my hands and wonder what they would feel like when being held. That no one will cherish me or want to spend time with me. That no one will ever want to have intimate conversations with me, or exchange soft kisses, or tell me that I‚Äôm handsome. No one will ever look at me tenderly or share whispered ‚ÄúI love you‚Äôs‚Äù with me.\n\nThere is no one out there who is thinking of me from time to time, there is no one missing me, there is no one loving me whether as a friend or something more. There is nothing except loneliness and being alone.\n\nIt‚Äôs not realistic for me, the undesirable, to hope that one day I might be desirable or loved. It‚Äôs never going to happen, and the sooner I realize it, the sooner I spare myself years of additional pain from broken hope.\n\nI can‚Äôt even cry about it anymore, it‚Äôs all numb. I will carry this sensation with me always, it seems.",

I'm trying to get these unhealthy thoughts out of my mind, so I hope it helps to write them down here. \n\nSo here we go:\n\n- I'm 26 and a virgin. There's only one person except me that knows about this. I hate that about my life, I have the feeling that I miss out on one of the best things in life. \n\n- If someone asks me about my sex life, I lie about it and tell them I hade a few one night stands. I'm just too embarrased to tell the truth. I'm afraid that everyone would just see me as \"the virgin\" and not as the guy who's fun and empathic. \n\n- I'm afraid of having sex, because I don't have any experience, which is unusual for people my age. I think that I'm not a good catch and that any woman deserves better because of that. Even though I'm dating right now (or at least I'm trying), I hope that this whole sex thing won't come too soon (pun intended).\n\n- I sometimes cry when I see people kiss in romantic movies, because I also want to experience this kind of sincere happiness. \n\n- I'm constantly jealous of people who are more successful with women. I know it's dumb and a bad character trait, but I can't help it. I try not to be jealous and be happy for them instead, but it's not always working. \n\n- Somehow, I think experiencing love is the most important thing in life and if I can't get that, everything else doesn't matter. I know that's wrong but at the same time this thought makes total sense in my head.\n\nAll of the above makes me a clich√© and I hate that. I don't really feel like a loser, but I'm sure a lot of people would if I told them this. Somehow it bothers me more what other people think of me than what I think about myself. That's not good for me, but I have a hard time to change that. \n\nLike I said, I'm trying to get better and to finally be honest with myself and others. This vent is a step towards better times (I hope). \n\nThanks for reading if you made it this far :)\n\nEdit: Wow, this post really blew up.

    "selftext": "At 40, Franz Kafka (1883-1924), who never married and had no children, walked through the park in Berlin when he met a girl who was crying because she had lost her favourite doll. She and Kafka searched for the doll unsuccessfully.\nKafka told her to meet him there the next day and they would come back to look for her.\nThe next day, when they had not yet found the doll, Kafka gave the girl a letter \"written\" by the doll saying \"please don't cry. I took a trip to see the world. I will write to you about my adventures.\"\nThus began a story which continued until the end of Kafka's life.\nDuring their meetings, Kafka read the letters of the doll carefully written with adventures and conversations that the girl found adorable.\nFinally, Kafka brought back the doll (he bought one) that had returned to Berlin.\n\"It doesn't look like my doll at all,\" said the girl.\nKafka handed her another letter in which the doll wrote: \"my travels have changed me.\" the little girl hugged the new doll and brought her happy home.\nA year later Kafka died.\nMany years later, the now-adult girl found a letter inside the doll. In the tiny letter signed by Kafka it was written:\n\"Everything you love will probably be lost, but in the end, love will return in another way.\"",

I felt like a background character in my own life. The wall. The desk. The air. \n\nI internalized that my existence was meaningless to others, and so I started to feel like my existence was meaningless to myself.

While his phone rarely makes noise unless its for work, my phone buzzes 24/7 with dudes that dont see me as a human and i have to block or ignore. \nBoth of us are lonely but in different ways.\n\nEDIT: this isnt an invitation to DM me, please don‚Äôt!",

Wishing you all the very best and thanks so much!\n\nEdit 2: actually crying at how many of you guys cared enough to wish me a happy birthday, who knew strangers on the internet could be better than most of the people I know. My day has been great because of you guys and I couldn‚Äôt be happier just scrolling through these comments with a smile on my face. I‚Äôve read and I‚Äôm still reading each and every message and I appreciate every one of you. Love you allüíô",

You can invite your friends\". Looking back it's pretty hilarious as it's sort of like lol mum I have no friends :') \n\n2) Having no one to share the excitement with\n\nIf you're really into a show or book, or musician or whatever, you have no one to talk about it with. No one there to share the excitement\n\n3) When people ask what you're doing on the weekend, you don't have much to say\n\nI remember people at work asking me this and panicking. At first I was honest (I mostly stay at home lol) but after a while I started making up fake plans like \"oh I'm going to the movies with a few friends\". I know, it's sad. \n\n4) Singing along to love songs and realising you've literally never experienced anything in that song lol\n\n5) Checking your phone and realising you have 0 notifications. When you do, it's from your data provider.\n\n6) Binge watching YouTube because it makes you feel like you have friends. And also accounts for a majority of your social interaction.\n\n7) Meeting people and realising that it's going to come out sooner or later that you have no mates\n\nThis one's a bit of a weird one. But in the past when I did have a friend or 2, they'd usually introduce me to their other friends. Over time though they'd start saying 'how come you never introduce me to yours?' I remember being invited  to a friend's birthday. They told me to \"bring a friend\" if I felt uncomfortable as I didn't know anyone. Little did they know they were my only friend :')\n\nI can't really think of anymore. But feel free to add",

I had no one to share Halloween with this year. I have no one to give presents to for Christmas.

I have no one that I can motivate or support their dreams and vice versa. It just kind of sucks is all. \n\nI'm sorry if this brings anyone else down, that's not the intention.

I'm living abroad, my family greeted me, most of my friends here left the country but some of them reached out, called and it's a pandemic and the city I'm in is a red zone today so yeah, I have an arsenal of excuses to feed myself despite the fact that past birthdays were lonely anyway when things were fine haha. I started feeling a bit sad when the folks that were calling where shocked to know that I'm doing nothing for my birthday. I was like 'but what should I do?'. But yeah, that made me seek y'all - other good lonely folks here.\n\nEDIT: I want to thank you all so much for your kind and loving comments. Even some people reached out to me privately, that ride has been extremely wholesome. I spent my birthday night having a pizza and a Moretti beer. I live abroad in Italia so I got myself a pizza napoletana (it contained tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, gorgonzola cheese, porcini mushroom and patate al forno), I watched 2007's There Will Be Blood for the first time (Daniel-Day Lewis got himself an Oscar for his performance in that movie, I highly recommend it) and reading your comments and messages literally made it a thousand times better. Thank you so much and happy birthday for all those who had their birthday today as well! :) ARIES!! üí™",

We spent thousands of pounds treating him with different types of chemo (I don't care about the money, I would do it again), and he got better and went on walks and jumped and played with us, but yesterday it was clear he had given up and he passed away on his own on the kitchen floor with us and our other dogs there.\n\nHe wasn't just a dog to me. He was my only friend. I am a middle aged married man and my wife (who lives her own life under the same roof) has lots of friends but I don't have any. My phone address book only hatd tradesmen in it. I spend all my free time playing with the dogs or playing games on my computer to make me forget. I don't even have online friends. People don't like me for some reason. My professional colleagues shun me even though I am a good person and will always help others. Only the junior office staff like me because I am not arrogant and always like to talk to them and help them with their problems, and many of them are animal lovers too. Maybe I just like animals more than people and I send out a bad vibe. \n\nMy father wrote me out of his will  and when he died my elderly mother said she never wanted to see me again. She moved and won't tell me where she lives and doesn't contact me. My brother (who was responsible for alienating them from me) has hated me for many years even though I have helped him so much without even expecting or receiving a single thank you. I would still help him or my mum, without question, if they asked but I haven't heard from them for two years. I have spent many hours crying at my loneliness and even swallowed my pride and told one of my colleagues who was sympathetic.\n\nMy dog was very sensitive and would always be by my side. We had a special bond. He even followed me into the toilet and sometimes, if I was walking and stopped and turned, I would trip over him because was only a few inches away. When we were in the same room, he would always watch me out of love and devotion. He was very timid and had little eccentricites like at night he would go out the dog flap to pee in the back garden but sometimes just sit there whining afraid to come back in, in case there was a dog bowl on the other side which might trip him up, and I would hear his whines, wake up and come downstairs to let him in and hug him and kiss him to say it's okay, I loved him so much.\n\nNow he's gone and I miss him and can't stop crying. He was my only friend in the whole world and I don't know how I can live in a world which doesn't have him in it. Right now, I am crying and I hate the world for taking him away.",

Nobody has ever shown romantic interest in me and it absolutely sucks. \n\nIf you aren't conventionally attractive, nobody wants you. It doesn't matter if you're a girl, guy, or anything in-between. You could be the funniest, most charismatic person in existence and still nobody would even look your way.\n\nEdit: This post has gained a lot of traction, more than I expected it to... I'd just like to say that I'm very disappointed in some of you. It seems a lot of the guys on here just read the title of my post and then they start typing their little argument. You'll never know what it's like to be a woman, unless you are one. So stop telling us what our lives are like.",

    "title": "Women can be lonely too",
    "selftext": "I see comments regularly on here about how women can‚Äôt really be lonely because it‚Äôs ‚Äúso easy‚Äù for a woman to find someone. This is blatantly false. I‚Äôm not saying being a man provides the same experience as being a woman. I‚Äôm saying that women don‚Äôt have it as easy as some guys think. \n\nSince these statements are usually about romance, let‚Äôs look at that. Women, much more than men, have to deal with potential partners showing an interest just so they can get laid. They‚Äôre no longer human beings. They‚Äôre objects. And sometimes when the woman does sleep with a guy, that same guy could, the very next day, act like he doesn‚Äôt know who she is. Like their intimacy never happened. Being an especially attractive woman doesn‚Äôt fix this problem. Attractive women can be treated like a trophy. Something appreciated only if she can make the man look good. If she isn‚Äôt pretty enough or thin enough or outgoing enough, it makes the guy look bad‚Äîor so he thinks. Again, that isn‚Äôt being treated like a human. It‚Äôs being a trophy. Nothing more than an expensive watch. \n\nIf the relationship progresses, she has to be on the look out for signs that the guy is a shitbag. A man-child. I see examples of it all over social media. The guy barely contributes to the household. He works part time and he spends all his free time playing video games. That leaves all the housework and child rearing to the woman who is already keeping the household expenses afloat. He was probably charming early in the relationship, and he has taken advantage of her commitment to treat her like a servant. \n\nJust because women might have guys pursuing them, that doesn‚Äôt mean they can‚Äôt be lonely. They can be trapped in a loveless and unappreciative relationship. Or they haven‚Äôt settled for just anyone, and they are alone and lonely because they can‚Äôt find someone who treats them well. \n\nI wanted to speak up because I see far too many r/lonely posts that cross the line into incel.",

    "title": "A relationship won't solve your loneliness.",
    "selftext": "I first began browsing this subreddit a couple years ago when I was going through a break-up and needed a way to cope. I read the heartbreaking stories of loneliness from many different walks of life: young and old, men, women and children.\n\nMy own experience with loneliness is quite simple. My father cheated and divorced my mother shortly after my birth. My father was harsh with my upbringing due to his fears that my mother, who won custody, would raise his son to be a sissy.\n\nFor most of my schooling, I was able to make a few friends although I battled with social anxiety and low self-esteem. After high school I lost contact with most of my friends. At college I made a few ‚Äústudy-buddies‚Äù but not really true friends.\n\nAfter graduating, I pursued further studies. At that time, I experienced what might have been depression although I was never formally diagnosed. My studies were severely impacted and I barely managed to graduate.\n\nAfterwards, I found work at a start-up in a basic administrative position. During that time, I began to think about my life. Despite my desire to do something meaningful in the world, I had wound up being quite average in most regards. I was friendless and worked a job that barely covered my necessities.\n\nOne day as I was walking home, I was suddenly hit with a deep and profound feeling of loneliness. Two years passed, yet I continued to feel intensely lonely and isolated. At work, I had been promoted a couple times and was no longer doing administrative chores. Despite this, my confidence was quite low.\n\nOne summer, we temporarily hired a vibrant, energetic university student during her summer break and I was assigned as her supervisor. Over time we grew close and on one occasion she flirted with me but I rejected her advances because of my position as her supervisor . After that incident, I distanced myself from her despite reciprocating her feelings.\n\nAfter she left, my loneliness deepened so I threw myself into my work. Over the next two years, I‚Äôd successfully coordinated a couple important projects and also managed to make a couple friends through work. I felt fulfilled to an extent.\n\nThen one day, out of the blue, an old acquaintance who I‚Äôd been in contact with over the years began messaging me constantly: from the moment I woke, to when I got ready for bed. Eventually she asked me if I ever had any feelings for her and I candidly admitted that I did at some point.\n\nWe met for drinks and about a month later, we were in a relationship. It was a rushed decision. While I was a quiet, introverted guy, she was an extravert with a very busy social life that included regular parties and clubbing. I went to a few with her, but I never enjoyed those things and would usually wait in a corner until she was ready to leave.\n\nShe earned far more than I did and her friends and acquaintances were all in her income bracket. I slowly began to resent that I earned so much less. I hated my old run-down car, especially in comparison to her flashy new car. I hated that I couldn‚Äôt take her to the sort of fancy restaurants she was accustomed to. I constantly felt like I needed to compensate for lacking so much. I‚Äôd never felt so inadequate in my life.\n\nSeveral months later, our disparities began to affect the relationship. My insecurities manifested as bitterness and mistrust. My mistrust was an especially huge issue. My father‚Äôs betrayal of my mother had made me a very untrusting person and as my girlfriend and I grew apart, I began to become more and more suspicious of her. I never outright accused her of cheating but she could sense my mistrust.\n\nWe started having frequent arguments and one day she revealed that she was no longer attracted to me and that she had feelings for an ex and wanted to meet him privately to ‚Äúfind closure‚Äù. At this point, perhaps a rational person would have realised that the relationship was over but I had developed an unhealthy attachment and I held on desperately to the fact that she hadn‚Äôt outright broken up with me.\n\nI made all sorts of desperate gestures to win her back like sending her a bouquet at her office and asking her out on dates (all of which she declined). Eventually she grew tired of everything and broke up with me in person.\n\nIn the ensuing grief, I took some time off from work. I couldn‚Äôt cope and my performance took a hit. About 5 months later, she messaged to tell me that she had moved on and found someone new. I wished her all the best.\n\nAs time passed, I was able to look at the things more objectively. Truth was that I felt very lonely in the relationship. She spent most of her time partying and travelling. When we did spend together, she was more engrossed with her phone. We lacked true connection and in the end I felt more like an accessory to her perfect life than an actual partner and companion.\n\nI started working on my problems. I began therapy and journaling. Through meditation and introspection, I learned some simple truths. At the end of the day, you have only yourself. Life is rarely filled with constants. People will inevitably come and go as they are swept up in the currents of their own lives; their own goals and desires.\n\nYou must learn to become comfortable in your solitude. You must take care of your own emotional wellbeing. It‚Äôs unfair to expect someone to come into your life and magic away all of your suffering. A romantic partner isn‚Äôt your personal therapist/motivational coach and isn‚Äôt responsible for your happiness. Getting a partner isn‚Äôt going to make your depression, anxiety or loneliness disappear.\n\nUnhealthy relationships begin when you enter with the mindset that the relationship is going to solve a problem or deficiency in your life. Sadly, many people think, ‚ÄúIf only I had a girlfriend/boyfriend I would be better off.‚Äù The truth is that you won‚Äôt. That‚Äôs like bringing a friend into your house that you haven‚Äôt cleaned in years and handing them a broom and telling them, ‚ÄúClean this up.‚Äù\n\nConfront your life! Identify the sources of your pain and deal with them. Clean your own house! It won‚Äôt be easy, and it may take years (I‚Äôm certainly far from completing the necessary work), but it will be worth it in the end.",

I reached out to him when I was 27 but he didn't want anything to do with me. Turns out he is a homeless, alcoholic, drug addict womanizer. He didn't like me because I \" wasn't rich and didn't have kids.\" I make a pretty good salary because I recently started working a government job but it would not be enough for him anyways.\n\n\n\nI have chosen not to have kids because mental illness runs in my family and I can't bring a kid into this world that would suffer like I have. I do hold it together tho. I have very little extended family but they arent the best. The only ones I was close to was my grandmother and grandfather on my moms side but my grandad passed away last month.

But sitting in the hospital made me realize I'm so alone. It just sucks sometimes. I have to stay strong but I just had to tell someone.\n\n\nUpdate: Thanks for all the support.

The sense of vulnerability.  The sense of security. The wholesomeness of knowing you have someone who will get happy at your accomplishments. someone who cheers you up.  besides all of them, the excitements of romantic gestures, intimacy and sex are what really energizes me.

The guy died.\n\nHe was a lonely guy, I'd say around 65. Used to live with his mom until she died at the like the age of 90, a very sweet old lady. I think he never worked a day in his life, even thou he finished college. I know he rented a house somewhere, and also collected bottles. So clearly not well adjusted, but I never had problems with him, except his hygiene was poor.\n\nSo I asked another neighbor, he said there was a smell, and his balcony doors have been left open since Friday, which is strange since there was a heat wave...so someone called the cops. It got me really depressed, thinking this could be me in XX years, in the same damn building one day. Except I'm higher up, so maybe nobody notices the smell for longer.\n\nAnother remainder how loneliness never really bothered me until I turned 40.

No more than my family members do I sympathize with myself for being gay: it's simply impossible for me to see myself with another man. So many people have told me to \"let go of the feelings and connect with who you really are.\" But being gay is most certainly not who I am. It's something I've struggled with since I was 12, knowing since then that an ideal, normal, perfect future was not a guarantee for me, and almost completely out of the question.\n\nI should mention that \"on paper\" I'm not doing too bad -- I hold a good position at my company, I get payed well, I'm happy my job and reasonably well-liked there, and I live in a nice house. But \"on paper\" isn't everything: I'm mentally destroying myself. If only I could find a way to either accept the fact that I'm gay or something else to push me over the hump of being a depressed 40 year old kiss-less virgin I'd probably be a lot happier. But alas no. \n\nMy greatest fear has always been being alone. My senior year of college was really scary for this reason. It was the last year I was guaranteed a vibrant social life with people I could talk to and emotionally open up to (albeit not my family). Now I'm reduced to trying and failing to get my point across on my 40th birthday on an internet site. \n\nOh well. To another 40 it is ü•Ç",

I expressed my desire to quit to my classmates in our class' WhatsApp group and I got mixed responses, but something happened that gave me a spark of hope in something I know I shouldn't be so hopeful about.\n\nAfter reading what I wrote, a girl from my class PM'ed me to tell me that she's struggling with her career choices as well and that this is her second attempt. She told me that she understands how I feel and that she is there for me if I ever need help. She also told me that she's using a certain website to help organise the subjects and assignments and that we could meet in a cafeteria so she could teach me how to use it. We couldn't agree on a time and date because we're both busy so the meeting is still on hold.\n\nNo person has cared for me in a long time, and when she sent me a private message tellig me she's willing to help me I really felt that. Allow me to quote a piece of text I once found online: \"The average guy is so starved for positive attention that a simple compliment is enough to get him interested in you\". This girl didn't compliment me, but she showed me kindness, one I haven't received for a long time.\n\nI badly need someone willing to help me and tell me that things are going to be fine, to the point that I started having thoughts on this girl that I know I shouldn't be having. My stupid brain, starved for positive attention, mistook basic kindness for love. I barely know this girl's name and I've already fallen for her just because she was nice to me once. And I hate that I feel this way.\n\nI'm going to wait until we meet to study in that cafeteria and then will see how things go with this girl. The least thing I want to do is be a creep and scare her. Even if things don't go the way I'd like them to go, I will always be grateful for her will to help me.\n\nSorry if this was too random.\n\nTL;DR: A girl from my class I barely know was kind to me in a low moment of my academic life and I fell for her because no one has cared for me in a long time.",

I would still be lonely. \n\nAnd another thing: stop telling me that a partner shouldn‚Äòt be a necessity because it‚Äòs unhealthy. Literally everyone who has told me this never loved themself and is now keen on giving tips. Of course it‚Äòs easier to be fulfilled and love yourself if there is someone who wants only you and sleeps next to you everyday. F*** all those hypocrites. Sincerely, a 22F who can‚Äòt take her friends in relationships serious anymore.",

    "selftext": "Everybody always comes to me with their problems, they use me as a shoulder to cry on, someone to vent to, a problem solver, ect. Now I‚Äôm glad to do those things as it means the person trusts me and I‚Äôm grateful that they feel they can open up to me, but honestly the weight of everyone‚Äôs pains start to get a little heavy sometimes. I feel as if everyone‚Äôs sob story/heartbreak/un happy ending are all starting to pile up in my mind and I‚Äôm getting tired of being everyone‚Äôs emotional support system. All of my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù (even the new ones I make), my mom, my ex, my boss, my coworker the list of people that drop their problems and miseries on me just goes on and on to the point that I don‚Äôt know if I can be there for everyone. I‚Äôm starting to feel less and less empathy for them and it‚Äôs as if I can feel myself just becoming....empty? And then we move on to the fact that I myself do not have an emotion support system of my own. I feel as if nobody is truly there for me. Everybody sees me as being this strong, happy, carefree person but it‚Äôs really just my wall of self defense. It‚Äôs me putting up a front to hide my weaknesses but I‚Äôm slowly starting to feel some cracks form in that wall. When things start to break down you either have to fix them or break them completely, you can‚Äôt leave it limbo forever. And I have no one to help repair me so therefore I guess I‚Äôll be left to break, slowly and all alone. Nobody ever asks if I‚Äôm truly okay, nobody every cares to hear my true feelings, nobody lets me freely express my emotions, I have no shoulder to cry on, people tell me that crying is for the weak, I don‚Äôt want to be weak yet I can only be strong for so long. Who supports the emotional support system???\n\nEdit: I am not suicidal so don‚Äôt take it that way. Just feeling some emotions and for once I‚Äôve decided against suppressing them.\n\nEdit #2: holy crap I honestly didn‚Äôt expect so many people to read my post or to have so many of you express being in a similar situation as myself. Means a lot that you guys took the time to read my post, helped fill the void a little:)",

I literally spend all my days at home playing my guitar, watching movies, playing csgo and forcing myself to study, and of course, all of this by myself.\n\nBut last year, and I still don't know how, around the beginning of summer I started going out with a girl. And this was the first time that I was in something relatively serious. Because until that time I had only kissed a few girls in high school and in parties (when I still had a social life), but it was not anything serious at all. So yes, this was the first time that I was truly interacting with someone that I really liked for a long period. Everything seemed to be fine, but of course, I am stupid, and I started lying...\n\nThis girl, besides being a litter younger than me had had quite a lot of relationships experience and sexual experience too. And as you can imagine, yes, I'm still a virgin, but of course, I didn't told her. And I don't want to sound arrogant but, by my looks and age, you wouldn't say that I'm a virgin, but I am. \n\nI wasn't brave enough to tell her what I was, and as I did with my friends (because I lied to them too when they asked me that), I told her that I've had some sexual experiences. So, not telling her the truth it was a clearly mistake, and if you add that, with my body insecurities created by porn, you can imagine what happened. When the big moment had finally arrived, I was not able to get it working. That was one of the most embarrassing nights of all of my entire life. Despite that, she was nice to me, and we kept meeting for a few more months. During that time, we make out a lot but we never really had sex in the end.\n\nBesides all that, I felt that she liked to be with me. She was always laughing with me and she explained me a lot of things about her life and her traumas. Sometimes I kind of felt like his psychologist, but I liked to hear her and make her feel happy. Little did she know all the struggles that I had in my mind. \n\nHowever, after things started to get colder, we broke up. And I realized how was really my life without her around. No more going out, no more messages, no more feeling that I'm important for someone and welcome back my dear desolation.\n\nNow that it's been like 3 months without her I can see that she wasn't near perfect at all, but still, it hasn't been a day that I haven't thought about her. And now nights are a nightmare... Now, even though I have never had sex with her (and with anyone indeed), I know what is like to fall asleep with someone and I just cannot fall asleep anymore... \n\nAnyways... I just wish that I had a friend who I could tell these things. But as I said I don't even have a single friend. I wish I knew how to make new friends or regain the lost friendships. \n\nIf you have arrived until here I truly want to thank you for reading my post. Feel more than free to tell me any advice or anything that you want and I hope you have a really great day!!!!",

I second guess everything I think about saying and so I just stay silent instead and people think I‚Äôm totally weird because I don‚Äôt talk to them.\n\nAt my job I‚Äôm mainly on my own except for sometimes my boss and another guy and it‚Äôs so awkward when I see them because I can‚Äôt talk to them.

And the problem is my boss is nice to me, because he‚Äôs my boss. And so my brain has decided that I‚Äôm in love with him. Just because he gives me attention when no other guys in my life do. He‚Äôs not even my type at all, he‚Äôs a lot older than me and he‚Äôs married. Being lonely lowers your bar I suppose.

I‚Äôm only happy when I‚Äôm busy. And even then I‚Äôm not really happy, I‚Äôm just not thinking about how my life is going nowhere. \n\nI know there‚Äôs other lonely people out there because of this subreddit, but I have never met someone with no friends in real life.

I am attending 3 meetings today, 2 online and 1 in an actual room, so i have to look happy and succeed in my assignments, but it is hard. It's hard to go out and watch people in groups walking together and having a good time while I go and get my coffee alone from my favorite cafe. I stopped going for walks alone because I feel more lonely as i see most people in my age group hang out and walk in groups. I succeeded an exam of a course that i took on my own, whereas most people were in teams of 2-3 and i had no one to share that success.. I try my best to succeed so that I can move out of my city and go somewhere else but oh boy it's hard being all alone. I tried making friends but they end up wanting a romantic relationship or they straight up treat me poorly,. I guess this happens because i am introverted and new people usually do come on their own to talk to me on social events (before a pandemic) but their motive was not friendly(keep in mind that i go to a uni that 9/10 are guys), but they would pretend to be my friends for months and when they realized that they cannot be romantic with me by their words they would be mad at me?So I am tired of this situtation and I stopped having contact with these people and I am afraid to meet others from this uni because this keeps happening  for 3 years. I just want someone that actually care about me and  i care about him/her of course, but I kind of lost hope...Sometimes I need a hug that bad so i hug my stuffed animals...

She had feelings for me even though she had a bf, she admitted those feelings and things were moving in the direction of us being together, she even broke up with her bf partly because of me....

We were actually amazing friends in the short time we knew each other and had a very special and effortless connection. But I forgot the fact I deserve nobody, and no matter what I'll be alone.\n\nI'm realizing more and more that I'm going to be alone forever and I should just accept that. I used to think it was things wrong with me. But I've matured, I'm not ugly anymore, I'm in good shape, I'm much less awkward and don't run out of things to say, I'm confident, I act more happy (even though I'm just as depressed lol).\nBut none of that will ever be enough, it's just me as a person who deserves no one.

I really wished I could hold their hand as a way to comfort them, but they were miles away. It inspired me to make an app that lets you hold hands with anyone regardless of distance.\n\nThe way it works is pretty simple. You wrap your fingers around your phone as if you were holding hands with someone. When two people \"hold hands\" like this at the same time, they'll connect and their phones will vibrate until someone lets go. That's all there is. You can't chat with anyone, upload profile pics, anything. It's just about holding hands.\n\nIt's available for both Android and iOS, and it's free. Well, there is a paid upgrade if you want to reach out to someone specifically (it's really just to offset potential server costs and prevent abuse; if you really don't feel like paying, just DM me). But if you're just trying to reach out to *anyone at all,* there's no charge for that.\n\nI realize that this isn't a great replacement for physical contact. I also understand that if not a ton of people are using the app, you may not make a connection.\n\nBut just maybe two people will hold hands for a while and feel a little less lonely. <3\n\n[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yokereba.held) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/held-together/id1585062364)",

And what‚Äôs crazy is that.. that was just me a year ago. Funny how things change so fast. When I look back it suddenly all feels like one long vivid dream.",

    "selftext": "In about 2 hours, I‚Äôll be 26 years old. Just four little years away from entering my thirties, and in hindsight, 25 has been pretty shitty to put it gently. \n\nI thought this was the year I‚Äôd hit my stride; the year I‚Äôd get back up on my feet after my first encounter with heartbreak, the year I‚Äôd find a job and start saving for many dreams and aspirations I want to fulfill, like traveling and buying something nice. \n\nInstead, this year was the one where I sank to my lowest: Sadness, anxiety, a year-long dry spell (that‚Äôs still ongoing), heartbreak, disappointment, unemployed, fear of becoming a failure, not knowing what I‚Äôll do, still in college, putting in weight‚Ä¶ and this myriad of misfortune was kicked off with a funeral. The funeral of someone I knew. Someone who wasn‚Äôt very close to me, but that I held in high regards. That person and their entire family, who had their lives taken away in a fire. \n\nI thought things would get better from then on. I went out with my brothers the following week, had a great time and told myself: I‚Äôm gonna go out more this year. I‚Äôm gonna be the very best version of myself. I‚Äôm gonna go out on dates again, and work to make me the man any girl would want. \n\nYet here I am. Many months later, sitting before my TV, eating a spaghetti dinner while the hour draws nearer to declare me beyond the halfway point of my 20‚Äôs. I‚Äôm at an all-time low, and the worst part is: I know I haven‚Äôt hit rock bottom yet. \n\nSo, to God or fate or whoever is listening: I don‚Äôt want a great, amazing year. The bar‚Äôs been set too low, and I don‚Äôt want to build up great expectations. I just want 26 to be good. Nothing special, nothing spectacular; just‚Ä¶ good. \n\nI just hope that, a year from today, I won‚Äôt find myself drenched in self pity and sorrow asking for words of encouragement, but rather giving them to someone who needs them. I don‚Äôt want to be asking for a helping hand, but instead giving it to someone because I now know what it‚Äôs like to feel so abandoned, lonely, desperate and heartbroken, and I wouldn‚Äôt wish this sensation upon anyone. \n\nSo, 26th year of my life: I don‚Äôt ask for finding love, I don‚Äôt ask for one-night stands or hookups, I don‚Äôt ask for a graduation, I don‚Äôt even ask that the Packers win the Super Bowl. \nI just want you to be less tough than 25. \n\nThank you for reading my post. Have a great day!",

Because she *couldn't.*  Now...this?\n\nI was a mess when I was young, she was the first person, only person, who ever paid me any attention.  We had a good year, good married, that first year was ok and then it went downhill.  Intimacy became less and less frequent.  Then stopped entirely.  She had--has--issues.  Bipolar, probably.  Maybe.  Who knows.  She never got it treated.  I waited, and waited.  And supported her.  Tried to just stand by hoping it would get better.  She never did.  \n\nShe stopped working.  Eventually she just stopped being nice to me, too.  Stopped even talking to me except to yell at me sometimes.  \n\nI'd never been with anyone before I met her so in a way it was kind of hard to miss something you never had, you know?  I work three jobs just to support us because she still doesn't work.  I have no friends.  I haven't even had someone hug me in 19 years.  I did all this for someone who once cared about me in the vain hope she would again one day.  \n\nThen I come home.  And she's left her browser open.  That happens, she's...forgetful, sometimes.  Because of whatever goes in her mind.  But this time amazon is open.  And she's ordered lingerie.  And a burner phone.  Delivered to an amazon locker.  \n\nShe *couldn't.*  That was what she said at the beginning when it stopped.  She just....couldn't.\n\nWell.  Now she can.  With someone.  just not me.\n\nAnd here I am...46 years old.  Not one single friend left in this world.  Haven't touched another human being in almost two decades.  Work 18 hours a day, 6 days a week.  The only people who talk to me are angry customers at one or more of my shitty jobs.  \n\nWeird thing is, I'm not even mad.  It's just more like...yeah.  Figures.  One more thing for this world to beat me down with.  \n\nHow is it possible for *nothing* to feel this goddamn heavy?\n\nI think I need a hug more now than I have in the last 19 years.",

I‚Äôve coped with this throughout the years but when COVID became a big problem things got really bad because even the small interactions I would have with people in class and stuff was now gone.\n\nThanksgiving and Holiday break are coming up for me, and this year I will be completely alone. No friends, no family, nothing. I live with four other guys and they have all left to go home and won‚Äôt be back at our apartment until late January. I‚Äôve just been thinking about how everything for these next couple of months will be me by myself. I‚Äôm literally doing nothing for thanksgiving, my birthday is over holiday break and I doubt that I will be doing anything for that (honestly I don‚Äôt even remember the last time I actually celebrated my birthday in any way). The only time I‚Äôll actually see people I know will be during Christmas because I‚Äôll definitely go home for that. \n\nI guess the reason why I‚Äôm posting this is to ask, what‚Äôs the best way to cope with this? What‚Äôs the best way to make a friend or two right now? My mental health just hasn‚Äôt been great lately due to being constantly doing schoolwork, actual work, and then not really having anyone to vent to and just talk with, so I guess I‚Äôd just really like to make a friend but don‚Äôt know where to start, so some advice would be great.

They started to develop new interests and started wanting new friendships. Although I only had 2 friends before, 2 or even 1 was enough for me. They began slowly drifting away. It was subtle until it finally hit that I was losing them, losing them to a more popular crowd. I understand why they would want that. Who doesn‚Äôt want more friends. No one wants to be the kid that no one remembers in high school. So they left. This broke me. I felt I had no one. No one to talk to. No one to laugh with. No one to share happy moments. I felt truly lonely. \n\nI read an article that mentioned, ‚ÄúRelationships are the most important overall contributor to happiness.‚Äù Knowing this made me feel even worse about myself. It made me feel like I wasn‚Äôt capable of happiness. It made me want to think about everything wrong with me, the reason why I could get or even keep any friendship. I started to think about every flaw I had. ‚ÄòToo ugly. Too boring. Too annoying. Too needy. Too pathetic.‚Äô I thought about my looks. Maybe I don‚Äôt try enough. I thought how I could change, but not in a good way. ‚ÄúI should start acting like someone else, like the pretty, popular girls. Maybe then I could get some friends.‚Äù\n\nAll these thoughts raced through my head until I just gave up. I didn‚Äôt care how I looked. I didn‚Äôt care how I felt anymore. I just wanted it all to be over. I fell into a depression. The loneliness took over me, leaving my heart empty. I needed someone. I needed a friend. That part of me was gone and all that was left was a hole. \n\nI continue to struggle, not knowing what to do. I started trying more. To be more interesting or social but it seems I‚Äôm just not a likable person. Nothing seems to work. Now, I sit by myself writing this story: The story of a lonely girl.\n\nEdit: wow thank you for all the comments showing your love and support. It really helps <3",

It‚Äôs annoying and rather lonely.\n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\n\nADD-ON: Thank you all for your comments and DMs. It truly opened my eyes to recognize that we are not alone in our loneliness. This is a universal concept that every one of us has been through or will go through at different phases in our life. The most important thing I got from all your messages is the power of never giving up. It will get better and we just need to push through the worst of it. \n\nI know that‚Äôs easier said than done, but just take a look at the community we have here! We might not all be in the same area or even the same part of the planet, but we all connected through our shared experience with isolation. I‚Äôm confident that we are not alone outside of Reddit. Let‚Äôs take our obstacles with the strength of all our friends here and diminish our feelings of loneliness and depression.\n\nGood luck to everyone!",

A month after I graduated, I was in a bad accident, and became disabled. I worked odd jobs and my partner helped support me until I got a settlement from the accident. My partner left me understandably, and I just tried to have as much fun as I could with my disabled body. I didn't expect to live to be this old. I made that 100k last 5 years, not bad. i tried to buy a house but was denied because my work history sucked since i became disabled). I ran out of money. Sex work ended up being the only job that I can do that actually sustains me with my fatigue and chronic pain and irregular pain flares.\n\nAll of my friends have settled down. I haven't had a partner in 10 years. Eventually, when you're single people just stop inviting you to stuff. I am 41 and I have nothing to show for my life. I spent the holidays alone.... I always spend the holidays alone so I pretend like I don't care about them. I have maybe 3 friends in the city that I live in that I each see once every couple months. Everyone is so busy.\n\nAnd I just kind of rot. I am broke. I am lonely. I just want like.... a good old fashioned brunch with the girls but i don't have that. A partner would be incredible, but the only people who want to date old disabled hookers are crazy people. I don't blame peoples prejudices, but I did wish that I would find somebody who could see past them that wasn't trying to use that against me.\n\nAnyway. I feel cursed. I am so fucking lonely, and so fucking sick of my only human interaction being with clients. I can't believe there was a time when I had a future that looked bright and people who loved me and a ton of friends. I wish I cherished it more.\n\nSending love to everyone. People don't understand that loneliness kills, and then we end up looking subhuman when we ask to get our completely normal need for human interaction filled.\n\nIt's kind of ironic, in a way, that my job is to provide companionship to lonely men, but nobody provides companionship to me.\n\nEdit: I am really glad I used a throw away because the amount of men in my messages is really intense. Unless you‚Äôre trying to help by buying me groceries or setting me up with a job, then you‚Äôre not helping you‚Äôre just kind of clogging up this account and making me not want to use it again ",

Made me really question my worth as a person.\n\n****He told me that even though in my current situation I didn‚Äôt have anyone to connect with, this didn‚Äôt mean I was a bad person or I was doomed to live my life without buddies. He said it was most likely due to the fact that I was constantly surrounded by the same handful of people every day and that I just didnt happen to click with anyone around me.****\n\nHe was right! A few months from him saying this, new people had entered my life and others had exited. I clicked with a few of the new people and now find myself in a great friend group.\n\nThe lesson here is to trust life and trust the fact that things change!!!!

I wish I was a virgin again sometimes because I'll never find a woman that actually finds me attractive or a single human being that knows what it's like to wake up an autistic victim of lifelong abuse and loneliness. I can't hack this anymore.  I hate my body so much. I hate my face. I want to die man ",

Being constantly told you‚Äôre undesirable and ugly fucks your head beyond words, especially being a woman, where your defining trait is physical appearance. It doesn‚Äôt matter how smart or funny or interesting I am, if you‚Äôre unattractive you will be treated accordingly. \n\nDamn after making this post, I forgot how many men here hate women üòÇ stay mad ",
